We urge the public to dismiss these misleading allegations with the contempt they deserve, reads the statement.\n\nMutapati added, The relationship between President Boko and President Mnangagwa remains diplomatic, focused solely on strengthening cooperation and fostering mutual development between the two nations.\n\nTuesday Grill, however, maintains its story is factual saying Mutapati was trying to discredit the paper.\n\nOpposition leader Job Sikhala said the dirty gift from Mnangagwa was to lure Boko after former President Mokwetsi Masisi,the candidate Zanu PF was backing in the recent Botswana elections lost.\n\nTo spin their embarrassment they are doing everything possible to soil and destroy the public image and trust of the new government in Botswana by going there and start throwing such gifts as announced in the story by the Tuesday Grill to tarnish the image of the new sheriff in Botswana, said Sikhala\n\n",

It is a fundamentally discriminatory law. It criminalises the victim and that on its own is problematic so you (women) must grab the bull by the horns and confront the courts on a real argument, he said.\n\nEdna Masiiwa the director of Women Action Group said the law is outdated having been enacted in 1977.\n\nIt is a law that does not serve todays woman, she said.\n\nZimbabwean abortion law is currently highly restrictive, with stringent requirements for the limited grounds on which abortion is allowed, based on very archaic legislation enacted in Rhodesia with no contemporary proven benefit for women and society at large.\n\nDespite the existence of permissible circumstances for abortion outlined in the Termination of Pregnancy Act, access to safe and legal abortion remains a challenge for many women, especially the rural and poor given the strenuous legal and administrative barriers.\n\n",

The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, this week we want to return to our series for investment opportunities for the diaspora in Zimbabwe. Is investing in microfinance institutions ideal in Zimbabwe?\n\nVM: The question can only be answered by dispassionately analyzing the historical and prevailing climate from an access to finance background. Historically, the economy was under sanctions for over 20 years, limiting general access to international and consequently local finance for the majority of the population.\n\nThe changes in currency and financial policies over the same period as a reaction to these sanctions decimated formal companies and employment and naturally grew the unbanked population, entrepreneurs and sole traders.\n\nThe result is that there is a large population hungry to finance their small enterprises and general living expenses, like school fees, through credit. The upside is that a significant percentage of the population owns the potential collateral outright as the positive effect of having no access to credit and the downside is that a significant percentage of the potential market has no recorded history or training in repaying debts, making them risky debtors.\n\nAs the saying goes, high-risk high returns, that being said, it is lucrative to invest in microfinance to the extent that the systems are sufficiently buffered against default.\n\nReporter:What are the regulations or licensing requirements for microfinance institutions in Zimbabwe?\n\nVM: Our laws have specific statutes regulating microfinance institutions, however, their establishment, supervision and regulation are carried out by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. In considering an application to register microfinance, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, among other things, is concerned with the financial stability of the proposed institution, the competence of its management and the adequacy of its risk management strategies.\n\nThere are minimum capital requirements depending on whether the microfinance institution will be credit-only or will be deposit-taking. Long and short, the application is evaluated on the basis of the institutions ability to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.\n\nReporter: Are there any restrictions on diaspora, non-resident or foreign investors investing in microfinance institutions?\n\nVM: The potential advantage they all have is that they have access to cheaper finance in their host or foreign country.\n\nIn terms of restrictions, the diaspora, non-resident or foreign investors are not necessarily the same person and from a procedural perspective, may be required to undertake different routes in starting out the process of establishing a micro-finance company depending on their residence status in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe foreign investor will have to start by acquiring the necessary approvals from the Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency and all are required to adhere to foreign exchange control regulations on investing and repatriation of profits and dividendset cetera.\n\nReporter: What measures or steps should an investor take if they want to invest in an existing microfinance company?\n\nVM: The first step will be a due diligence of the legal, financial, operational, commercial, environmental and social structure of the microfinance company before one can invest. Key to this due diligence is the microfinance institutions regulatory and tax compliance, risk management processes and responsiveness to regulatory changes.\n\nThe process will have to include thorough due diligence on its governance structure, business plan, financial reports and projections, internal policies to combat money laundering and terrorism financinget cetera.\n\nReporter: What steps would I take when I want to close down the microfinance company?\n\nVM: Once the necessary board resolutions for closure are in place, the company will have to notify the regulatory authorities of its intention to close down. They may then be informed of what they are required to do before closing down. Generally, there is a need to settle obligations, notify stakeholders, cancel licenses and permits, liquidate assets and so on and so forth.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima atvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",
