            "content": "IOL\n\nThe Patriotic Alliance (PA) leader Gayton McKenzie has reiterated his demand for the deportation of illegal foreigners, declaring Abahambe, (let them go), insisting that undocumented foreigners working in restaurants and receiving healthcare should leave.\n\nMcKenzie argued that illegal immigrants dominate the restaurant industry in Cape Town, Western Cape, while South Africans remain jobless.\n\nHe added, despite being labelled asxenophobicfor his views, he has embraced the label.\n\nIve embraced that. But heres the issue. This is the uncomfortable thing that you dont want to hear, but youre going to hear today, McKenzie said in an interview with BizNews.\n\nMcKenzie, who also serves as the Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, has repeatedly called for the deportation of illegal foreigners.\n\nHe claimed that undocumented foreigners are not contributing to the countrys economy by VAT, and are taking the jobs that South Africans could fill.\n\nIllegal foreigners working in your houses, working in your businesses, you dont VAT them. You leave them with your children, you dont know who they are, McKenzie said.\n\nHe further alleged that some of these people were arrested in their home countries and, upon release, entered South Africa illegally.\n\nSome of them, when they are in jail in Ethiopia, when they get released from jail, they come to South Africa. When they are in jail in Zimbabwe, when they are released, they come to South Africa, he said.\n\nAll illegal foreigners need to leave this country.\n\nMcKenzie expressed concern with foreign nationals being hired as workers while South Africans are often overlooked for jobs.\n\nHe suggested this is driven by racism, as employees prefer foreigners who have no rights, unions, or recourse.\n\nWhen you start saying stuff like, Zimbabweans are hard workers, South Africans dont want to work, no, its not about South Africans who dont want to work. It is your racism that you are hiding, that you prefer a foreigner, because they have no rights, he said.\n\nHe continued, stressing the harm caused byundocumented immigrants, especially in violent incidents.\n\nIf somebody kills your brother, your sister, your mother, and they are not documented, its only then when youll see the harm that illegal foreigners are causing us.\n\nMcKenzie called on all restaurants in Cape Town to stop employing illegal foreigners.\n\nGo to every restaurant in Cape Town, illegal foreigners are working. Stop hiring illegal foreigners. Get someone who is South African and can pay VAT.\n\nHe also argued that illegal foreigners should not receive medical attention in the country, saying that their presence contributes to the long lines at healthcare facilities.\n\nThe people that dont have medical aid must stand in the line and theres 10 Zimbabweans ahead of them, he said.\n\nMcKenzie also criticised the housing system, claiming that foreign nationals are taking up the spaces on RDP housing lists meant for South Africans.\n\nThe people that apply for housing must stand in the line because there are 300 Mozambicans on the same housing list, he said.\n\nHe reiterated that 12% of South Africas prison population consists of illegal foreigners, which he said is not normal.\n\nSo Im still saying to you,Abahambe, they must go, he said.\n\nWith the upcoming 2026 local government elections, McKenzie emphasised that deporting illegal immigrants, specifically those working in restaurants and accessing healthcare services will be a key focus for the PA.\n\nNext year, when we start the campaign, we are coming to all the businesses, all your businesses that are hiring illegal foreigners. We are going to give you South Africans to work there. They will have no excuse. . ., he said.\n\nGet rid of your illegal foreigners now, because next year is not going to be easy. You heard it here first.\n\n",

We have no capacity locally to produce enough to replace them timeously.\n\nFor the wooden poles, the policy we now have is that we replace them with concrete ones which are more durable, Moyo told lawmakers.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) was previously quoted in media reports saying it lost electricity transmission and distribution equipment valued at over US$2 million to theft and vandalism between January and October 2024, a development that has left many communities already struggling with load-shedding in the dark.\n\nAccording to the power utility, nearly 30 tonnes of copper conductors valued at US$600,000, along with 10 tonnes of aluminium conductors worth US$103,000, were stolen during this period.\n\nAdditionally, 1,543 litres of transformer oil valued at US$7,700 were siphoned off by thieves, while 136 transformers  essential components in electricity transmission  were vandalised, costing US$848,558.\n\nDaring vandals also targeted bolts and nuts from high-voltage pylons, causing damage exceeding US$4,300.\n\nIn total, ZESA recorded 1,317 cases of theft and vandalism, resulting in losses valued at US$2,163,207.\n\n",

Everyone should go on the streets. We want Mnangagwa and his corrupt cabals to step down on 31 March. We appeal to those who can provide transportation to assist.\n\nCome out in numbers so that these people leave. We dont want to hear that law enforcement agents descended on the public or hurt them. Be warned. Its a wave and its unstoppable. Let people demonstrate freely. It is a constitutional right. We are doing this for Zimbabweans. So that everyone gets a better life, said Geza.\n\nGeza has not held back in his criticism ofthe government, which he accuses of cronyism and running the country into the ground.\n\nThe outspoken war veteran is currently on the run after challenging Mnangagwa to step down and not seek re-election in 2028, despite pressure from a faction within the ruling party, ZANU-PF.\n\nGeza claimed that he has the support of political figures such as Nelson Chamisa and Job Sikhala in his plan to protest against Mnangagwas government.\n\nFellow Zimbabweans. The signal is now close. We will bring it up in a clever way, so that our enemies will never know. It will be in a few days. We know that Mnangagwa wants to declare a state of emergency but that will not work. We will deal with our issues as Zimbabweans.\n\nWe have engaged all political players like Chamisa, Sikhala, Mwonzora, Komichi and we agreed on a way forward. For your own information all these people like General Chiwenga. So be warned, the signal is coming very soon, he said.\n\nThe infighting within ZANU-PF serves as a reminder of the 2017 internal battles that led to the coup, which toppled Robert Mugabe from power.\n\n",

The complainant bled due to the assault, but she managed to escape, leaving Ncube in her room, the State proved.\n\nIt is at this juncture that the State alleges that Masunda later came back around 2200 hours and discovered that Ncube had stolen a piggy bank in her wardrobe, which had US$10,000.\n\nMasunda allegedly contacted Ncube, asking where her piggy bank was but he prophesied ignorance and ordered her to report the matter to the police, and that is when he was arrested.\n\n",

As of 14 March, 11 million kgs had been sold compared to 15 million for the same number of selling days in the 2023/24 season, she said.\n\nDuring the period, group revenue for Q1 was 9% below the comparative period in prior year.\n\nThe delayed onset of the summer rains adversely affected the Groups agriculture-based operations. Group profit was, however, significantly ahead of the previous year as a result of cost containment measures implemented towards the end of the 2024 financial year.\n\nIn preparation for the start of the tobacco selling season in Q2, Tobacco Sales Floor maintained its decentralised floors in Karoi, Mvurwi and Marondera in addition to its Harare Floor and increased the level of automation to meet the targeted volume throughput.\n\nIn the TSLs logistics division, tobacco handling volumes in Q1 were 34% below prior period and forklifts hire hours were 11% below prior year as most tobacco merchants closed operations earlier due to the reduced 2024 tobacco crop.\n\nGeneral cargo storage volumes were 66% ahead of prior year as a result of the delay in the onset of the summer rains, resulting in agricultural inputs being kept for longer than anticipated. The handling volumes were resultantly depressed as most of the fertilizer received will be distributed to customers.\n\nThe Groups acquisition of a 51.43% stake in Nampak Zimbabwe is on track for completion in Q3 2025. The Board is currently engaged in obtaining the requisite approvals for the acquisition. Notwithstanding the challenging operating environment, the Group will continue to pursue key strategic initiatives that are expected to enhance shareholder value, added Pedzisayi.\n\n",

The music was stored on password-protected hard drives kept in a safe at Eminems studio in Ferndale, Michigan, according to an FBI affidavit.\n\nJoseph Strange, 46, of Holly, Michigan, is charged with copyright infringement and interstate transportation of stolen goods, Acting U.S. Attorney Julie Beck in Detroit said. Strange, who lost his job at Eminems studio in 2021, could face up to 15 years in prison if convicted of both counts.\n\nStranges attorney, Wade Fink, said in a text to The Associated Press that Strange is a married father of two with decades of dedication to the music industry. He called the charges untested allegations that havent been vetted by a grand jury or a judge.\n\nWe will handle the matter in a courtroom and we have great faith in the judges of our district, he said.\n\nStudio employees reported the theft to the FBI in January, saying unreleased music that was still in development was being played on various websites, including Reddit and YouTube.\n\nA review showed someone transferred files from a hard drive in a safe to an external hard drive in October 2019 and January 2020, when Strange was a sound engineer at the studio.\n\nInvestigators found buyers after Eminem business associate Fred Nassar posted an online warning to fans not to distribute the music.\n\nA Canadian resident who used the screen name Doja Rat told investigators he had purchased 25 unreleased songs from Strange for about $50,000 in Bitcoin. He said he raised the money from a group of fans of Eminem, whose real name is Marshall Mathers III.\n\nStrange also was trying to sell some of Eminems handwritten lyric sheets, Doja Rat said.\n\nAnother group of fans organized by someone in Connecticut using the screen name ATL also purchased a couple of songs from Strange for about $1,000, according to the affidavit.\n\nAn FBI search of Stranges home in January turned up numerous handwritten Eminem lyric sheets and notes; a VHS tape of an unreleased Eminem video; and hard drives with 12,000 audio files. The music was in various stages of development and created by Eminem as well as by other unidentified artists working with him.\n\nEminemwon for best hip hop actat the 2024 MTV EMAs and was inducted into the Rock&Roll Hall of Fame in 2022.\n\nThe affidavit notes that Strange signed an agreement as part of his severance package that specifically prohibited him from electronically circulating Eminems work.\n\nProtecting intellectual property from thieves is critical in safeguarding the exclusive rights of creators and protecting their original work from reproduction and distribution by individuals who seek to profit from the creative output of others, Beck said in a news release.\n\n",
