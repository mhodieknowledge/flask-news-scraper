fights within the political hotbed of Mashonaland Central province.\n\nZanu PF Mashonaland Central Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) is reportedly behind the plot to obliterate Musarara.NewZimbabwe.com is in possession of a letter directed at Musarara, a Zanu PF district chairperson in the province, demanding that he avails himself for disciplinary hearing at the partys provincial headquarters in Bindura.He stands accused of leaving meetings before their conclusion and failure to supervise cell restructuring.At times and when you manage to attend provincial meetings you sit briefly and quickly sneak out without notifying anyone, even the provincial chairperson, reads letter signed by chairperson of the disciplinary committee Christopher Magomo.NewZimbabwe.com is also in possession of Musararas response wherein he demands clarity on charges and evidence of his departure.Musarara could not confirm receipt of the letter that was delivered to him on May 21 this year.Sources within the province revealed that the charges are well worked, following yet-to-be-confirmed information that President Emmerson Mnangagwa could be considering stepping down as per constitutional dictates.If Mnangagwa decides not to go ahead with plans to stay in office beyond 2028, provincial and district structures within the party will have to prepare and participate in primary elections.Home Affairs Minister Kazembe Kazembe, a well-known, perennial rival of Musarara is said to be behind the charges in an attempt to have him barred from participating in the primaries, which are said to be set for next year.Kazembe, who reportedly ordered police details to trail Musarara, did not answer his mobile phone on Sunday.Most of those within Kazembes camp where banking on the 2030 Agenda and not doing anything be it in their wards or constituencies but now that we hear the President might decide against it, the issue is now about dismissing competition by any means possible, said a source from within the Zanu PF Mashonaland Central PEC.\n\nZanu PF Mashonaland Central Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) is reportedly behind the plot to obliterate

            "content": "By Farai Mutsaka l Associated Press\n\nCHITUNGWIZA, Zimbabwe  Its before sunrise on a Saturday and a small group has gathered at Socialite Bar on the outskirts of Zimbabwes capital. Instead of nursing hangovers, they sit with eyes closed and bodies in meditative poses on the bare floor.Its an unlikely setting for a yoga class. In Zimbabwe, the practice is rare and mostly found in the wealthy suburbs. Yet it is quietly taking root here in a beer tavern in Chitungwiza, a low-income town 30 kilometers (18 miles) outside the capital, Harare.The initiative is led by Actions Winya, a yoga instructor who saw how economic hardship and social pressures were damaging the mental health of people in his hometown.Yoga is expensive  but we also got humans in the ghetto. They need mental wellness, said Winya, who usually teaches in affluent areas, charging between $30 and $100 a month. Thats an impossible cost for most, especially in a country where many survive through informal jobs.Since 2023, Winya has been offering free weekend classes to some of those hardest hit by Zimbabwes economic problems.The sessions have become a source of relief for people navigating relentless challenges.Authorities acknowledge a growing societal crisis worsened by drug abuse, domestic violence and poverty, compounded by a shortage of public health services and therapists.I am a coach, so they bring the stuff that they face within families (to me). This is where we come in and say, Guys, come and try yoga, it can help somehow, Winya said.Yoga, an ancient Indian practice, has become a multibillion-dollar industry and a daily ritual for millions around the world. The United Nations over a decade ago designated June 21 as International Day of Yoga.In Africa, other countries like Kenya and South Africa are introducing yoga to poorer communities, with the Indian government promoting its spread across the continent.Inside the tavern in Zimbabwe, mellow music played as about a dozen participants moved through poses. They had no mats, just a cold brick floor, but plenty of determination for inner peace. One mother tried to stay focused as her toddler dashed around, disrupting her poses.For 47-year-old John Mahwaya, the practice has been transforming. A father of four, he also supports relatives in the countryside, a responsibility he said once weighed heavily on his mental health.My head was always spinning. I thought I was losing my mind, and the stress started causing back pains, he said. Yoga helps me relax and clear my mind. I sleep peacefully these days.He said many Zimbabwean men bottle up their emotions, afraid to show weakness in a highly patriarchal society that prizes toughness.We focus on physical fitness, forgetting the mind, he said. We suffer slowly, but what suffers first is the mind, and from there, it becomes a slow death.Edinah Makosa, 24, joined the class earlier this year and said it gave her hope.I used to be depressed a lot. You know, for people my age, our main stressors are unemployment and relationships, she said.Yoga changed my mindset. I used to think negatively all the time. Now I have started selling beauty products to earn a living. As for romance, well if it works, it works; if it doesnt, it doesnt. I no longer stress about men. I go with the flow.As they practiced, the sounds of township life seeped in. Taxi drivers shouted for passengers. Vendors pushed carts, calling out to potential customers.We need a proper environment and studio. But we are trying, Winya said.For participants like Mahwaya, the location didnt matter nearly as much as the healing.We need to promote yoga in the communities because everyone has a mind. And fitness of the mind is the responsibility of everyone, regardless of where you live, he said.\n\nCHITUNGWIZA, Zimbabwe  Its before sunrise on a Saturday and a small group has gathered at Socialite Bar on the outskirts of Zimbabwes capital.

They had no mats, just a cold brick floor, but plenty of determination for inner peace. One mother tried to stay focused as her toddler dashed around, disrupting her poses.For 47-year-old John Mahwaya, the practice has been transforming. A father of four, he also supports relatives in the countryside, a responsibility he said once weighed heavily on his mental health.My head was always spinning. I thought I was losing my mind, and the stress started causing back pains, he said. Yoga helps me relax and clear my mind. I sleep peacefully these days.He said many Zimbabwean men bottle up their emotions, afraid to show weakness in a highly patriarchal society that prizes toughness.We focus on physical fitness, forgetting the mind, he said. We suffer slowly, but what suffers first is the mind, and from there, it becomes a slow death.Edinah Makosa, 24, joined the class earlier this year and said it gave her hope.I used to be depressed a lot. You know, for people my age, our main stressors are unemployment and relationships, she said.Yoga changed my mindset. I used to think negatively all the time. Now I have started selling beauty products to earn a living. As for romance, well if it works, it works; if it doesnt, it doesnt. I no longer stress about men. I go with the flow.As they practiced, the sounds of township life seeped in. Taxi drivers shouted for passengers. Vendors pushed carts, calling out to potential customers.We need a proper environment and studio. But we are trying, Winya said.For participants like Mahwaya, the location didnt matter nearly as much as the healing.We need to promote yoga in the communities because everyone has a mind. And fitness of the mind is the responsibility of everyone, regardless of where you live, he said.\n\nSince 2023, Winya has been offering free weekend classes to some of those hardest hit by Zimbabwes economic problems.\n\nThe sessions have become a source of relief for people navigating relentless challenges.Authorities acknowledge a growing societal crisis worsened by drug abuse, domestic violence and poverty, compounded by a shortage of public health services and therapists.I am a coach, so they bring the stuff that they face within families (to me).

            "content": "By AFP\n\nFIRST impressions can be deceptive, but Kirsty Coventry showed that behind a sunny disposition she will have the mettle to deal with the trickiest of people and situations when she succeeds Thomas Bach as president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Monday.\n\nLooming large on the horizon of the 41-year-old Zimbabwean  the first woman and African to occupy the post of the most powerful single figure in sport is US President Donald Trump.With Los Angeles hosting the 2028 Olympics, Trump will feature often on Coventrys agenda.Trump has not been shy in giving public dressing downs to world leaders  notably Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa.Judging by Coventrys initial response, after a crushing first-round victory in the presidential election in March, she may have Trumps measure.Navigating Challenges and Embracing Failure: Lessons from Coventrys CareerI have been dealing with, lets say, difficult men in high positions since I was 20 years old, she said, adding communication will be key.Unlike Trump, though, Coventry embraces the word failure, for it helped forge her stellar career.Everythings scary. Embrace that. You have to fail, Coventry told the swimming team at her American alma mater Auburn University last year.Ive learned the best lessons by failing, and I have failed at many things. Life has a really good way of humbling you.At the same time that steely resolve comes to the surface when winning is at stake.I was banned from playing card games with the family, because they didnt like to deal with me when I lost, she said.A Glance at Coventrys CV Suggests Failure in Her Life Has Been RelativeCoventry, who had the Olympic rings tattooed on a leg after her first Games in 2000, is a two-time Olympic gold medallist and she has contributed seven of Zimbabwes overall Games medals tally of eight.She has accrued domestic political experience, as she was Zimbabwes Minister for Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation from 2019 to this year.That attracted some flak as she was serving in a government whose election in 2023 was declared to be neither free nor fair by the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ).I dont think you can stand on the sidelines and scream and shout for change, she said in her defence.I believe you have to be seated at the table to try and create it.Her record as a minister has been heavily criticised by the Zimbabwean arts community in particular.Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, whose predecessor Robert Mugabe labelled Coventry a golden girl and awarded her $100,000 after she came back with a gold medal from Beijing in 2008, hit back.Whoever was not impressed by her can appoint someone else when they become president, said the 82-year-old.Very hard timesIn 2004, Coventry gave an insight into why she would later accept such a poisoned chalice and how whites in Zimbabwe have to perform a delicate balancing act.Zimbabwe is my home, she said after returning to a heroines parade after winning her first gold medal at the Athens Olympics.Its where I was born.
