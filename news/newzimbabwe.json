            "content": "By Newzwire\n\nKARO Platinum has completed earthworks at its new mine in Ngezi and is in advanced talks to raise an additional $165 million to complete the project, which has faced significant delays due to low platinum prices.\n\nManaging Director Bernard Pryor says the company has so far spent $140 million on developing the mine, which will be Zimbabwes third-largest platinum producer upon completion.Earthworks are always challenging, but weve completed them to 100%, Pryor said during a call with analysts on Thursday.The project will have a 132 kV powerline, while the Chirundazi Dam has been built to supply water.Its a big project, but everything that we need is in close proximity, he added.Karo has opened a tender for a mining contract to begin stripping overburden and prepare for mining.This is a large contract; we need a highly competent mining contract to move an extensive amount of material, some 1.41.5 million BCM (bank cubic metres) per month, said Pryor.On funding, Tharisa Financial Director Andrew Henwood says: We are in advanced talks with a lending syndicate, South African and African banks. We are targeting $165 million of that funding.Karo has already raised $37 million through a bond on the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange and may extend the facility. It may also raise between $50 million and $100 million through a gold streaming agreement, where a buyer provides upfront capital for a share of gold produced as a by-product.As far as the timing is concerned, we are looking at first ore in mill starting 15 months after we close the fundraising, Henwood said.Sitting on the Great Dyke, Karo will include a 10-year open-pit phase and a 30-year underground mine, producing 226,000 ounces annuallybehind Zimplats (646,000 oz) and Unki (244,000 oz).Karo had hoped to complete the mine in 2024, but had to push back timelines due to the collapse in global platinum prices, which has stalled investment across the industry.Phoevos Pouroulis, CEO of Tharisa, said: While we have slowed development at the Karo Platinum Project in line with capital availability, we have nevertheless continued work on infrastructure, water dams and further optimisations including commencing with studies for the future underground mine development, while presenting the opportunity to non-traditional financiers, who like us, see the long-term benefits of the uniqueness not only of this Tier 1 project but of the applications PGMs will play for decades to come.The Zimbabwe government has a free 15% stake in the mine, and has an option to buy a further 11%.\n\nManaging Director Bernard Pryor says the company has so far spent $140 million on developing the mine, which will be Zimbabwes third-largest platinum producer upon completion.\n\nEarthworks are always challenging, but weve completed them to 100%, Pryor said during a call with analysts on Thursday.The project will have a 132 kV powerline, while the Chirundazi Dam has been built to supply water.Its a big project, but everything that we need is in close proximity, he added.Karo has opened a tender for a mining contract to begin stripping overburden and prepare for mining.This is a large contract; we need a highly competent mining contract to move an extensive amount of material, some 1.41.5 million BCM (bank cubic metres) per month, said Pryor.On funding, Tharisa Financial Director Andrew Henwood says: We are in advanced talks with a lending syndicate, South African and African banks.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nHIGH Court judge, Justice Joel Mambara has ordered a Masvingo woman, Eugenia Machaya to pay US$25 000 adultery damages to the wife of a man she snatched six years ago.\n\nA default order was granted in favour of the complainant, Viola Dhudhla Machingura after Machaya failed to attend pretrial meetings.\n\nMachingura had sued Machaya for US$50,000 after she invaded her 41-year-old marriage.\n\nBroken down, US$30,000 was for contumelia and US$20,000 was for loss of consortium, arising from a protracted adulterous relationship between Machaya and her husband.\n\nThe court heard the relationship started in 2019 and Machaya now has two children with Dhudhlas husband.\n\nThe plaintiff, a retired university lecturer and church elder, testified through affidavit to public humiliation in her congregation and community, severe emotional trauma requiring medical treatment for diabetes, hypertension and depression, and the stripping away of her role in the family estate (bank accounts, farm operations and vehicles), the court heard.\n\nSince 2019 the plaintiffs husband has cohabited with the defendant; intimacy, companionship and joint family life have ceased entirely. The marriage now subsists only in name, court papers further show.\n\nMachaya, despite service, elected to remain absent and, therefore, offered no apology or mitigation.\n\nThe matter was set down on the unopposed roll after her plea was struck out for non-attendance at the pre-trial conference and her subsequent application for rescission was deemed abandoned.\n\nLiability was, therefore, not an issue and the court was only seized with the assessment of quantum under r 25(1) of the High Court Rules, 2021.\n\nWhile handing down his judgement, Justice Mambara said when fixing adultery damages the court considers the nature and duration of the marriage, knowledge of the marriage by the adulterer, character and social-economic standing of the parties and the extent of contumelia and loss of consortium proved.\n\nThe judge also looked into contrition (or lack thereof) by the adulterer, the need for deterrence; and the level of awards in comparable cases.\n\nMambara said there is no reported High Court decision after that of Taoneyi vs Madzima ((HH 18-25) has exceeded the composite figure of US$20,000.\n\nInflation-adjusted though that award is, it remains the highest recent comparable award placed before the court, he said.\n\nThe judge said the plaintiff had a long, otherwise stable marriage.\n\nHe said there was total lack of contrition by Machaya adding that such offenders deserve deterrent penalties.\n\nThe court is satisfied that an award modestly above the most recent ceiling of US $20,000 is justified to reflect both changing economic realities and the egregious facts of this case.\n\nAccordingly, it is ordered that the defendant shall pay to the plaintiff the sum of US $25,000 made up as follows:(a) Contumelia: US $16,000 (b) Loss of consortium: US $9,000.\n\nHe ruled that interest shall run on the above amount at the prescribed rate of 5 % per annum from the date of this judgment to the date of full and final payment.\n\nMachaya will also pay Dhudhlas costs of suit.\n\n",

While conducting monitoring and evaluation, we asked the headmaster to provide statistics on any dropouts at the school.

We must advocate for our girlsall of us here, said Gata.\n\nThe ministry has partnered with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and child protection agencies, leading to increased reporting of early marriages and teenage pregnancies.\n\nDespite the governments stance and legislation against relationships with girls under the age of 18, cases of early marriages and adolescent pregnancies continue to be recorded.\n\nGata also stated that, out of the 3,433 affected girls, 667 had been readmitted into the school system.\n\nWe have readmitted girls into our schools.

Additionally, 710 pregnant girls have been readmitted, said Gata.\n\nCitizens Coalition for Change (CCC) Member of Parliament Mutsa Murombedzi challenged the government over the high dropout rate, noting that some pregnancies were linked to rape.\n\nAre any arrests being made? It is good that we have the Hon.
