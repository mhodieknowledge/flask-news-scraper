            "content": "BBC\n\nThe Italian fashion designer and billionaire brand owner Giorgio Armani has died at the age of 91.\n\nHe was the archetype of Italian style and elegance, reimagining mens and womens suits for a modern audience.\n\nHis company Armani expanded from fashion into an empire spanning beauty, fragrance, music, sport and even luxury hotels, bringing in more than 2bn a year.\n\nDonatella Versace paid tribute to the late designer on her Instagram page,posting a picture of him, saying: The world lost a giant today, he made history and will be remembered forever.\n\nIn a statement onthe brands Instagram page, it said Armani  worked until his final days, dedicating himself to the company, the collections and the many ongoing future projects.\n\nIt also said he was indefatigable to the end and driven by relentless curiosity and a deep attention to the present and to people.\n\nThe designer was seen as a pioneer in many ways, elevating red carpet fashion to what we see today.\n\nHe was also the first designer to ban underweight models from the runway, after the death of model Ana Carolina Reston in 2006 from anorexia nervosa.\n\nGetty Images Giorgio Armani was seen as a pioneer of suit tailoring for men and women\n\nRussell Crowe described Armani as a man who made a mark acknowledged around the globe.\n\nThe actor said he adored Armani and was meant to be seeing him this month, adding that the designer was there for so many significant moments in my life.\n\nJulia Roberts shared a picture of herself in an Armani dress alongside the designer on Instagram with the words A true friend. A legend and a heartbreak emoji.\n\nBritish designer Paul Smith also spoke about his dear friend and fellow designer.\n\nHis continuity, his down-to-earth nature and his staying power in remaining as an unlisted, independent company have always been a huge inspiration for me personally,Smith wrote on social media.\n\nHe has been an enormous source of strength and creativity for many years.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also paid tribute, saying: With his elegance, sobriety, and creativity, he was able to bring lustre to Italian fashion and inspire the entire world.\n\nAn icon, a tireless worker, a symbol of the best of Italy. Thank you for everything.\n\nIn a profile in The Financial Times, in one of the designers last interviews, Alexander Fury wrote: He put women into a uniform of suits just as radical as Chanels, creating forceful, confident clothing that helped to power the working womans social revolution of the 1980s.\n\nBy contrast, he relaxed menswear, deconstructing traditional tailoring in a manner that has affected how just about every suit in the world is made.\n\nA friend of Hollywood, he understood the power of publicity and dressed some of its biggest stars for the red carpet including for the Oscars  including Zendaya, Cate Blanchett and Julia Roberts.\n\nHe also designed stage outfits for Lady Gaga and various costumes for films American Gigolo and The Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nEven as he entered his 10th decade, Armani continued to present new collections on the French and Italian catwalks.\n\nHis March 2025 show was designed to make a statement on global politics, with him stating that he wanted to imagine new harmony as he believed that is what we all need.\n\nConcern over his health was first expressed in June this year, when he missed Milan fashion week.\n\nHe directed a couture show in Paris in July 2025, but did this remotely from his home in Milan.\n\nArmani was described as a true gentleman and titan of the industry by Vogues Laura Ingham, who paid tribute to the late designer.\n\nShe added: If you dont know anything about fashion, youll still know Giorgio Armani. Mr. Armani built a house synonymous with timeless Italian elegance and enduring style.\n\nReferencing his classic style, which included refined silhouettes and immaculate tailoring, she concluded that his legacy is woven not only into fashions past and present but will continue to shape its future for generations to come.\n\nStarting his career in medicine, he moved to fashion in the 1960s and set up his own luxury label in 1975 alongside his late partner Sergio Galeotti.\n\nHe faced much criticism during his career, including in 2015 when he said a gay man does not need to dress homosexual.\n\nHis company also reached a financial settlement with Italian tax authorities over offshore subsidiaries in 2014, though no wrongdoing was admitted.\n\nAway from fashion, he was a keen sports fan and supported Serie A football team Inter Milan and owned the Olimpia Milano basketball team.\n\nThe fashion brand also had a partnership with the Scuderia Ferrari F1 team, with one of their drivers, Charles Leclercwriting on Instagramthat it was a great honour to have had the chance to meet and work with such an amazing person.\n\nArmani was also presented with the French Legion of Honour and Italian Order of Merit for Labour for his work in fashion.\n\n",

Is it illegal to put some tint on your car?\n\nIn response, Ziyambi clarified: The law allows tinting on a vehicle, provided it does not obstruct the drivers clear line of vision. For side windows, we have not yet reached a final agreement together with Hon. (Felix) Mhona, Hon. (Kazembe Kazembe), and other stakeholders.\n\nDangamvura-Chikanga MP Prosper Mutseyami pressed further, asking whether Mugutis announcement represented government policy or his personal opinion.\n\nZiyambi stressed that only Information Minister Jenfan Muswere, Information Secretary Nick Mangwana, and Presidential Spokesperson George Charamba are authorised to speak on behalf of government. The moment someone speaks on behalf of the whole government without that authority, it becomes a mistake,he said.\n\nKuwadzana East MP Charlton Hwende revealed that some drivers had been fined by police following Mugutis announcement.\n\nZiyambi responded: There is no policeman who enforces social media announcements without a Statutory Instrument. Policemen enforce the law by quoting Statutory Instruments. If anyone was given a ticket, they have the right to go to court, and the court will take corrective measures. Our policemen are orderly; they do not do that.\n\nMP Gladys Hlatywayo questioned how government planned to address the policy discord that had caused confusion and public outcry. Ziyambi replied that the role of MPs was to provide oversight, not to set policy.\n\nEarlier, Charamba took to X (formerly Twitter) to clarify that Mugutis announcement was a miscommunication by an unauthorised official.\n\n",

Zimbabwean journalist and commentator Hopewell Chinono also attended and addressed the event.\n\nThe guest of honour at the Joburg event,Mozambican main opposition leader Venncio Mondlane, was allegedly blocked by Mozambican authorities from attending physically, but he addressed the event virtually.\n\nIn his address, Mpofu said Africans today are heavily dividedalong lines they cannot explain.\n\nIn the song (that was sung at the book launch event) somebody was talking about makwerekwere (a commonly used derogatory slur in South Africa against foreign nationals, particularly those from other African countries). We have allowed ourselves to be divided along lines that we also cannot even explain ourselves, said Mpofu.\n\nHow can we havemakwerekwerehere in Africa? Just tell me, how many people know that people of Matabeleland actually come from here? The entire Matabeleland  they come from here literally.\n\nMatabeleland is a vast region in southwestern Zimbabwe, named after the indigenous Ndebele people who reside there. It is divided into three modern-day provinces: Matabeleland North, Matabeleland South, and the city-province of Bulawayo.\n\nMpofu also referred to the sharing of languages among different groups of Africans found in different nations.\n\nThat is not a coincidence, we do not ask ourselves why? Why is that so? It is becauseMziilikaziwho moved from here, is the same person who was fighting alongside Shaka, and this is not a long time ago. It is less than 200 years ago. In historical terms, that is not a long time.\n\nBecause of those wars, Mzilikazi actually moved from what we call KZN (KwaZulu-Natal) now and lived here, in Gauteng, for a long time until the so-called Voortrekkers came and then it is only then that he moved across the Limpopo. So the very same people, who 200 years ago were sitting together in KZN are now calling each other  this one is makwerekwere. We must wake up as Africans, we really must, said the former chairperson of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF).\n\nHe said oppressors have used borders to divide Africans.\n\nWe worship things that have been imposed on us. Who came up with the borders? Was it us? In 1884 there was a meeting in Germany with white people only, not a single African. Not one African, I think even the people that were serving tea were white. And those people decided to cut our continent into pieces as they liked.\n\nIf my village and Jobs village, if they decided and cut it, he is now in another country and I am now in another country. They didnt care, they were cutting it according to the riches of the continent, said Mpofu.\n\nWhy is it that in the United States, you have 51 states and can move around without borders? Why are we as Africans not asking those questions? The answer is this: the only reason we are fighting is that we are not economically developing our continent.\n\nMpofu said if Africa was developing as a continent, there would be no need for the extensive restrictions on peoples movement.\n\nPeople do not move because they hate their homes. They move because of economic factors. That happens everywhere. I am here because of economic factors. I come from the Eastern Cape. So you can call me kwerekwere as well, said Mpofu.\n\n",

Contrary to a finding of ordinary negligence, the facts disclose gross negligence.\n\nHombarume admitted driving a Honda Shuttle at up to 100 km/hr in a 60 km/h zone when he struck and killed 46-year-old Custon Charumbira in April this year.\n\nHe had no drivers licence.\n\nThe trial court sentenced him to 24 months imprisonment, wholly suspended on condition that he performs community service and does not commit a similar offence.\n\nJustice Dube said the magistrate erred by placing undue weight on the victim impact statement from Charumbiras widow, who had recommended a non-custodial sentence after the accused paid compensation, funeral expenses and pledged further support.\n\nA victim impact statement cannot trump the interests of justice, said the judge.\n\nCourts should not allow offenders to buy themselves out of a custodial sentence simply because they can pay compensation.\n\nThe judge stressed that with Zimbabwe facing high rates of accidents on our roads, courts had a duty to send a strong warning to offenders who drive without licences resulting in fatalities, that such conduct will attract censure of the courts.\n\nThe High Court withheld its confirmation of sentence, remitting the matter to the magistrate to reconsider punishment and to conduct a mandatory inquiry into whether Hombarume should be prohibited from driving under section 64(3) of the Road Traffic Act.\n\nThe aggravating features of this case do not justify community service, Justice Dube concluded. Community service imposed in circumstances such as these has the effect of trivialising the offence of culpable homicide arising from road traffic accidents.\n\n",
