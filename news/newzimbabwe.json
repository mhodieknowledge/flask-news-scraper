            "content": "The Guardian\n\nTwenty-two years is a long time, even in a sport that measures its games in days and its history in centuries. The last time England played a Test match against Zimbabwe, in 2003, Rob Key was in the middle order instead of the managing directors job, Jimmy Anderson was a 20-year-old tearaway playing in his very first series, and the England and WalesCricketBoard was just about to launch the worlds very first professional Twenty20 tournament. Zimbabwean cricket has changed, too. Back then the team was in the earliest stages of a transformation that was meant to turn cricket from a minority game, played by the small white population, into a sport that better represented the whole country.\n\nThey have been hard years, riven by player strikes, political interference, maladministration and a miserable drop-off in results. The team temporarily withdrew from Test cricket, suspended their domestic competition and were repeatedly censured by the International Cricket Council. They lost so many players through emigration to England, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, that even now you could build a hell of a good Zimbabwean squad out of people who are making a living overseas. And yet, at the end of it all, the process was, by one important measure, a success. The squad that came on tour in 2003 was majority white, the team that has come this year is majority black.\n\nDespite all the politics, despite all the chaos that weve been through, cricket is now a national game, says David Coltart, supported by an overwhelming majority of Zimbabweans, black and white and other races. Coltart is the elected mayor of Bulawayo, a white man elected in a mostly black city. He has spent his life navigating the bitter, heated, complicated politics of his country. He has been fighting for the Zimbabwe he believes in ever since the 1990s, first as a founding member of the Movement for Democratic Change and a key figure in the opposition to Robert Mugabe, then as minister for education and sport in Morgan Tsvangirais coalition government.\n\nMore than five million people have emigrated from the country in that time. Coltart is one of the ones who stayed. I believe in Zimbabwe with a passion, he says, I believe in its people and its future, and I believe it is a country worth fighting for.\n\nWhen Andy Flower and Henry Olonga made their public protest against the death of democracy in their country in 2003, it was Coltart they asked to help draft their statement. My sadness is that Henry and Andy didnt stay in the country, he says, because they remain hugely influential figures. Its not a criticism. I understand why they felt compelled to leave. But we need figures like them. He mourns Heath Streak, who did stay, butwho died in 2023. Heath provided inspiration to people on both sides of the argument. He was a white man who was fluent in Ndebele, and who attracted a lot of sympathy and affection from a lot of black people, and yet he remained an inspirational people for white farmers whod been dispossessed of their land.\n\nFor Coltart, the Zimbabwean team is emblematic of the society it represents. We punch above our weight. Which is why he believes transformation had to happen.\n\nIt was very necessary, Coltart says. Cricket in Zimbabwe 30 years ago was a minority sport. If you just looked at the crowds they were, relatively speaking, very few black people in them. Even aside from the principle of the matter, that situation was completely unsustainable. He just wishes it had been done differently. He makes a comparison with the redistribution of land, and the violent farm takeovers which were the cause of so much pain, grief and injustice in the 2000s. The land holdings were unjust, he says, But we could have done it without violence. Now, there wasnt violence in cricket, but I think that when you look at the dreadful collapse of cricket in 2004, that could have been avoided.\n\nWhen Zimbabwe stopped playing Test cricket, Coltart helped lead the campaign to restore it. In government he spent a lot of time lobbying the English to start playing fixtures against his country again. The ECB turned its back on the country, even after the end of the Mugabe regime. It was only when Richard Gould took over as the chief executive of the ECB that things finally changed. They disregarded us and while I understand the reasons, Ive never felt that England should not be playing Zimbabwe, Coltart says. Although Im a strident critic of the Zimbabwean regime, Ive always believed in the power of sport to bridge divides.\n\nEven now, he would be against a boycott of Afghan cricket on similar grounds. Because if the players and the board members themselves are trying to do the right thing but are being constrained by the government, then youve got to support them and encourage them, not boycott them. Use the game, the opportunities it provides, to build relations, and to hold them to higher standards.\n\nHe is still trying to do that in his own country now, as mayor. Bulawayo has just won the right to host theStreet Child Cricket World Cup. But Coltart is deeply concerned about the way the sport is being run. Theres still far too much politics involved in Zimbabwe Cricket, in the running of the organisation, and even in the selection policies. I still fear that were not spending the money that we get as best we should. Im a politician, but I dont think politicians should be anywhere near cricket administration. I would rather see people whose primary attribute is a great passion for cricket being involved in the running of the sport. Id like to see our best players from the past dominating the selection panel, black and white.\n\nStill, he beams when he thinks that Zimbabwe are going to play a Test at Trent Bridge this week. Despite the politics, despite the abuse of the rule of law and corruption in the country, all the concerns that I have regarding the government, the vast majority of Zimbabweans are united. Its a wonderful country and you will see that in our cricket, we are a passionately multiracial team, and thats a wonderful projection of our country.\n\n",

He then took the skillet with the eggs, tried to hit her, and she fell to the ground, Richard said.\n\nShe said it seemed like Ventura dropped to the ground because she anticipated the hit: She went into the fetal position.\n\nCombs then dragged Ventura upstairs by her hair and with his arm around her neck, Richard said. She recalled hearing glass breaking and yelling from upstairs.\n\nRichard, who worked with Combs from 2004 to 2011, shared that fear prevented her from intervening or contacting authorities at the time.\n\nI was scared to do anything in fear of what that might mean for me, too, she admitted.\n\nRichard testified that the following day, Combs summoned her and another woman who witnessed the incident into a recording studio, where he allegedly dismissed the incident as mere passion, warning them that people go missing if they talk.\n\nRichard, now 42 years old, later filed a lawsuit against Combs, accusing him of sexual battery, harassment and false imprisonment.\n\nAlthough Combss defence team claimed they were unaware of Richards intentions to discuss the skillet incident, prosecutors said that they had informed the defence about it back in March.\n\nThe trial continues with Combs facing serious charges, including sex trafficking, conspiracy racketeering and engaging in prostitution, to which he has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe trial resumed on Monday, May 19, with Richard expected to continue her testimony.\n\nThe trial, slated to span approximately eight weeks, will hear from more women whose identities will remain anonymous.\n\n",

During the stop, one male suspect fled into nearby bushes, while two female suspects attempted to escape but were apprehended after a foot chase, said Mashaba.\n\nThe women aged 19 and 20 were arrested, and are facing charges of possession of a suspected stolen motor vehicle.\n\nPreliminary investigations confirmed that the vehicle was stolen on 16 May 2025 in the Garsfontein policing area in Pretoria East, Gauteng.\n\nIn a separate but related intelligence-driven operation, Mashaba said officers intercepted a Toyota Corolla Cross at Mokopane CBD on the R101 road, which was also en route to the Beitbridge port of entry.\n\nInvestigations revealed that this vehicle had been reported stolen at the Wierdabrug (City of Tshwane) policing area on Friday. The driver, a 34-year-old undocumented foreign national, was arrested, said Mashaba.\n\nThe two women who were found with the stolen Toyota Hilux are scheduled to appear before the Polokwane Magistrates Court on Tuesday.\n\nOn the other hand, the man who was found with the stolen Toyota Corolla Cross will appear before the Mokopane Magistrates Court on Tuesday.\n\nAn undocumented man was found driving a stolen Toyota Corolla Cross towards Beitbridge port of entry.

As of now, some of the linens are tattered, some furniture is broken, and some infrastructure is in dire need of renovations, she added.\n\nShe told the Committee that the current renovations that are being made were from the little funds from the dilapidated infrastructure.\n\nIt is important to take note that 2019 occupancy is higher than 2024, whilst the 2024 arrivals are higher than 2019.\n\nThis substantiates the fact that the market is slowly neglecting the Zimparks accommodation, and this is mainly due to the state of the product, said Chitsaka.\n\nChitsaka highlighted that the regulatory framework was not in order, as the Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (PRAZ) framework posed operational challenges for Small Business Units (SBUs) within National Parks, such as Tshabalala Refreshment Centre, the Kariba Refreshment Centre, the Zambezi Rock Pool, and Rhodes Nyanga Hotel.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nThis story contains details that some people may find distressing.\n\nThe most shocking thing for Jonathan, who had endured six gruelling months living and working underground in an abandoned South African gold mine, was the abuse he witnessed being meted out to children.\n\nSome are recruited for cheap labour, but others are brought in specifically for sex, campaigners say.\n\nJonathan, now in his late 20s, had migrated to South Africa from a nearby country on the promise of making easy money working in one of its dozens of disused mines, closed by multinationals because they were no longer commercially viable.\n\nWe are protecting his full identity as he fears reprisals from the vicious criminal gangs that run the illegal mining industry for speaking to the media.\n\nDetails of what the young people were going through emerged after the death of dozens of illegal miners near the town of Stilfontein late last year when the mine was blockaded by police.\n\nIn a calm and steady voice, Jonathan describes the heat, long hours and limited food and sleeping options which took a toll on his body.\n\nBut an enduring memory is what happened to the underage miners in the shaft where he worked.\n\nI used to see these kids in the mine  teenagers actually, 15, 17-year-olds.\n\nOthers used to take advantage of them sometimes. It was a little bit scary, and I wasnt comfortable with it.\n\nHe said they were raped by adult miners who promised to give them some of the gold they found in exchange for sex.\n\nIf that kid is desperate for money, he will take the risk.\n\nJonathan describes how the children would approach teams of miners for protection but that team would have conditions.\n\nSex was also used as punishment if the teenagers failed to complete a task for their team.\n\nJonathan says the children in the mine where he worked were all foreign and did not realise what they were getting themselves into.\n\nAFP Illegal miners enter abandoned mines through disused shafts, often descending kilometres and not able to leave for months\n\nMining researcher and activist Makhotla Sefuli backs this up.\n\nHe says criminal gangs specifically target children to work in illegal mines across South Africa.\n\nMany of them are abducted from neighbouring countries and trafficked. They are enticed by baseless promises of finding them employment in the formal mining industry.\n\nTheir passports are confiscated when they get to South Africa It is common knowledge that these young boys are being abused, Mr Sefuli says.\n\nThe BBC has spoken to miners who worked in at least two other illegal mines who told us they saw children being abused in the shafts where they were working.\n\nTshepo, not his real name, says he saw older men forcing young boys to have sex with them underground.\n\nIn some instances, they did it for the money. Some are recruited solely for that purpose, because of the financial incentives that will come with the practice of maybe trading sex underground.\n\nHe adds that the abuse deeply affected the children.\n\nThey change their behaviour patterns and have trust issues. They dont want you to get close to them, because they feel that they can no longer trust anyone.\n\nSouth Africas illegal mining industry made global headlines last year following a standoff between police and miners at the Buffelsfontein gold mine, near the town of Stilfontein in the North West Province.\n\nThe authorities had been trying to curb illegal mining, which the government said cost South Africas economy $3.2bn (2.6bn) in lost revenue last year.\n\nThey launched an operation called Vala Umgodi, or seal the hole, in December 2023, promising to take a tough stance on the gangs.\n\nAs part of the operation, the police limited the amount of food and water that went down the Stilfontein mine to, as one minister put it, smoke out the illegal miners. Officials said the men were refusing to come out for fear of being arrested.\n\nSoon footage began to emerge from within the mine showing dozens of emaciated men begging to be rescued, as well as rows of body bags. Eventually a court ordered the authorities to save the men.\n\nAmong those brought up were many who said they were underage, but as a number of them were migrants without documents confirming how old they were, the authorities carried out medical tests to get an estimate.\n\nThrough this, the Department of Social Development (DSD) confirmed that 31 of the rescued Stilfontein miners were found to be children. They were all Mozambicans nationals and in November, 27 of them were repatriated.\n\nSave the Children South Africa helped translate some of the interviews between the underage miners and the rescue workers.\n\nThey went through trauma, because some of them also saw others being sexually exploited, the charitys CEO Gugu Xaba tells the BBC.\n\nJust the feeling that they may not come out of there destroyed those children mentally.\n\nThe adult miners would start by grooming them, by acting like they like them.\n\nShe says the children were then made to perform sexual acts on the adults and they were then raped, days after day.\n\nYou find that the adult will have three or four of them that they are doing the same thing to.\n\nBBC Most children are trafficked in order to be used as sex slaves. And youve got a pimp who is taking the money, Gugu Xaba, CEO, Save the Children South Africa\n\nMs Xaba says mining gangs recruit children because they are easier to manipulate and cheaper.\n\nChildren dont understand when you say: Ill pay you 20 rands ($1; 0.80) per day. The adults sometimes refuse to work, but children find themselves with no choice. So its easier to use a child to do the work. Its easier to take a child whos kind of voiceless and to bring them down there.\n\nBeyond being exploited financially, she says there are gangs that recruit children specifically for sex.\n\nMany illegal miners spend months underground, rarely going up to the surface. Markets spring up underground to provide them with anything they need.\n\nMost children are trafficked in order to be used as sex slaves. And youve got a pimp who is taking the money, and it means every day this child is used as a commercial sex worker.\n\nThe BBC asked the police and the DSD whether anyone would be charged over the sexual abuse allegations. They did not respond to our requests.\n\nA source working on the Stilfontein miners cases said many of the children did not want to testify.\n\nMeanwhile, the illegal mining industry continues to thrive.\n\nAnd with an estimated 6,000 vacant mines potentially available to explore, it is a business that is unlikely to end anytime soon, leaving thousands of vulnerable children at risk.\n\n",

            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has flagged nearly 300 motorists caught flouting traffic light regulations in Harares Central Business District (CBD).\n\nThe sting was made possible by a new, technologically advanced traffic monitoring system, aimed at bringing order to the countrys roads.\n\nLast May, the Cabinet gave the nod to the engagement of Vitronic Machine Vision Middle East, a Dubai-based firm specialising in Smart Traffic Management Systems.\n\nThe promise, then, was that this technology would help curb road rule violations by leveraging cutting-edge capabilities to optimise traffic flow, bolster safety, and improve the overall efficiency of the nations transport network.\n\nThe ZRP appears to have confined its initial efforts to the capital.\n\nIn a statement released Monday, National Police Spokesperson Commissioner Paul Nyathi appealed to the 290 motorists with listed vehicle registration numbers to cooperate with the police over the next seven days, without specifying the consequences should they fail to present themselves at Mkushi Police Academy (formerly Morris Depot).\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police has embraced the Electronic Traffic Management System and is appealing for cooperation from 290 motorists with the listed vehicle registration numbers to assist in the ongoing investigations, Nyathi stated.\n\nThe motorists or vehicle owners are urged to fully cooperate and assist in the maintenance of law and order in the country by reporting to the police within the next seven days.\n\nThe police have emphasised their determination to bring an end to the anarchy on Zimbabwes roads, imploring motorists to abide by the Highway Code.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police reiterates that with the advent of technology in policing, the days of reckless driving by motorists are coming to an end, Nyathi added. Drivers are reminded to be law-abiding citizens and collectively contribute towards road safety.\n\nSimilar traffic monitoring systems have been adopted by various countries, including Morocco, Rwanda, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, France, and Germany.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTanganda Tea Company has won a US$41,816 claim against businessman Darlington Matsitukwa following a protracted legal battle dating back to 2018.\n\nMatsitukwa was refusing to pay the amount in foreign currency, arguing that the company waived its right to get the money in foreign currency by initially accepting ZW$5,876 he paid towards settling the debt.\n\nHe also argued that the 2019 legal changes in payment of foreign debts changed everything and he was entitled to pay the amount in local cuurency.\n\nHowever, High Court judge Justice Faith Mushure ruled in favour of Tanganda Tea Company, ruling that Matsitukwa should pay US$41,816.\n\nMushure said the beneficiary of a statutory right is at liberty to waive such an entitlement conferred by the law for his or her benefit.\n\nThe provision is essentially an exception clause to the general position that contractual obligations valued in USD immediately before the effective date, that is February 22 2019, were to be paid in RTGS dollars at parity or at a one-as-to-one rate.\n\nOnce a debt satisfies the jurisdictional facts that establish a foreign obligation, such a debt, by operation of the law, is excluded from the ambit of s133 of 2019, she said.\n\nWhile the court observed that it would be commercially unacceptable to attempt to settle any foreign loan or obligation in local currency, it also issued a critical rider that the parties involved may mutually agree to settle the foreign loan or obligation in local currency.\n\nIt is clear in my view that when the appellants allegedly waived their rights, they were not aware of the rights and legal implications. It took the hearing and the decision of this court to identify and confirm the rights.\n\nIn the present matter, the plaintiff cannot approbate and reprobate in relation to the repayment of the initial ZW$5,876 in local currency, said the judge.\n\nThe judge said the amount was deducted from the capital sum and cannot be repaid in foreign currency again due to plaintiffs initial acceptance of the same.\n\nIn the final analysis, it is my finding that the claim partly succeeds.\n\nThe principle of a waiver does not apply as a defence to the repayment of the outstanding US$41,616. The facts do not establish the existence of a tacit agreement between the parties in this regard.\n\nThe court then declared the debt of US$47,493 as a foreign obligation.\n\nUS$5,876 was deducted from the amount and Matsitukwa was ordered to liquidate the judgment debt of US$41,616.\n\nTanganda Tea Company was ordered to restitute Matsitukwa the ZW$41,616 he paid.\n\nThe background is that in January 2018 Tanganda Tea company and Matsitukwa entered into an agreement in which the company was to sell tea products worth US$47.493 to the latter for resale in Malawi.\n\nMatsitukwa was given the products but did not pay.\n\nThe company then sued him in a mattter that was heard by the High Court and only ZW$5,876 was recovered.\n\nMatsitukwa then made two separate payments of ZW$16,000 and ZW$25,717 to the Trust Account of Tanganda Tea Companys lawyers, thereby extinguishing the debt before 22 November 2019.\n\nTanganda then refused to accept the payments insisting that it was a foreign debt and should have been settled in USD.\n\nThe parties then agreed that that indeed the debt is a foreign debt and should have been paid in USD.\n\nThe point of departure is whether the initial payment in ZWL and its acceptance extinguished the obligation to pay the debt in USD.\n\nMatsitukwa argued that Tanganda Tea Company waived its right to have payment of its debt in USD.\n\nHe argued that following the issuance of the judgement under HC10306/18, a writ of execution was duly issued, resulting in ZWL5,876 being realised from him.\n\nHe further argued that in trying to recover the outstanding balance, the company issued summons for civil imprisonment against him.\n\nMatsitukwa urged the court to note the deduction of the ZWL payment from the principal sum of US$47,483 by the company leaving thebalance at USD$41,616 which it claimed in the summons for civil imprisonment under HC6686/19.\n\n",
