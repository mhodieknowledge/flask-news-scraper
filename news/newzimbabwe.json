What I request is that the Hon. Member should bring the paperwork which talks about the prevalence of homicide cases.\n\nIf we respond to such a question without evidence that this is happening, this is an issue which does not augur well, said Ziyambi.\n\nIn recent months, the country has been witnessing murder cases related to gun violence. They have been attributed to the proliferation and ownership of guns by individuals.\n\nIn May this year, the Zimbabwe Republic Police raised concern about the increase in illegal firearms, which is in contravention of the Firearms Act Chapter 10.09.\n\nZiyambi further said the government does not tolerate homicide cases.\n\nGovernment does not want to see homicide cases happening because it is a criminal offence. It is one offence which had a capital punishment life in jail. In the past, it used a death sentence which was given to an offender.\n\nSo, when we look at the issues to do with homicide, you would find that when criminals hear that there are punitive penalties that have been given to perpetrators of homicide, then this would discourage others.\n\nI want to urge the Hon. Member to put in writing his question so that we get clarity and that we also clarify, he said.\n\n",

Benin is a very stubborn and disciplined team, and they usually dont concede. So its going to be a very tough encounter for us, but we have to grind out a positive result.\n\nThe Warriors will be without vice-captain Marshall Munetsi for the Benin clash.

Witnesses described the horrific scene.\n\nAccused 1 and 2 (Silethemba and Below) continued chopping at the deceased, crushing his head in the process. I tried to stop them but was met with threats of assault, said one witness.\n\nThe postmortem report confirmed the severity of the assault, citing cranioencephalic structures destruction as a result of assault with a machete and multiple incised wounds on the back.\n\nThe machetes used measured 32 and 50 centimetres.\n\nThe accused tried to claim that temporary insanity caused the fatal blow, alleging that Silethemba mistook the victim for a snake. The court rejected this defense, calling it a figment of imagination and noting there was no medical evidence to support it.\n\nKabasa described the attack as cruel and condemned the accused for showing no remorse.\n\nLife ought not to be lost under such cruel circumstances and at a public place, traumatising members of the public You did not show contrition by assisting with funeral expenses and left the deceased lying there as if he was a wild animal.\n\nThe court emphasised the aggravating factors: the young age of the victim, the use of lethal weapons, the public nature of the crime, and the gang involvement.\n\nThe assault was deliberate and ruthless. The deceased stood no chance. You were out to kill, and you achieved that purpose, the judge said.\n\nEach of the accused, all first-time offenders, was sentenced to 25 years in prison. The two machetes used in the killing were ordered destroyed.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court in Hwange has jailed a 24-year-old man for 16 years after finding him guilty of fatally stabbing a man who reprimanded him for holding a 16-year-old girls hand.\n\nKhonzaphi Mumpande was convicted of murder following a violent confrontation at Chitongo Business Centre on Boxing Day, 2024.\n\nThe court heard that Mumpande became angry when the victim, Manager Mwinde, told him to stop holding his teenage nieces hand, warning him that she was underage. The two exchanged harsh words before being separated. Moments later, Mwinde was found 70 metres away with a deep stab wound to the chest.\n\nJustice Evangelista Kabasa, sitting with two assessors, said Mumpandes version of self-defence was a lie.\n\nWhat was he defending himself from? the judge asked. The use of a knife on a human being almost always ends in death. The accused stabbed the deceased on the chest, perforating the heart. He must have appreciated that death could ensue but could not care less.\n\nThe judge described Mumpandes story as false and embellished, noting that witnesses had tried but failed to disarm him of the knife and a brick he carried that evening.\n\nYou were annoyed because the deceased reprimanded you for accosting his 16-year-old niece, Justice Kabasa said. Your reaction was totally uncalled for. Life is precious and there is need to respect the sanctity of life.\n\nIn mitigation, the court considered that Mumpande is a first offender, a married father of two, and had paid nine beasts and US$200 in compensation to the victims family. He also spent six months in pre-trial custody.\n\nBut the judge stressed that the killing was needless and devastating: A life was needlessly lost. The deceased had a family and children who now have no father or husband.\n\nRejecting the minimum five-year term and the presumptive 20 years for knife killings, the court imposed a 16-year prison sentence.\n\n",

A legend and a heartbreak emoji.\n\nBritish designer Paul Smith also spoke about his dear friend and fellow designer.\n\nHis continuity, his down-to-earth nature and his staying power in remaining as an unlisted, independent company have always been a huge inspiration for me personally,Smith wrote on social media.\n\nHe has been an enormous source of strength and creativity for many years.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also paid tribute, saying: With his elegance, sobriety, and creativity, he was able to bring lustre to Italian fashion and inspire the entire world.\n\nAn icon, a tireless worker, a symbol of the best of Italy. Thank you for everything.\n\nIn a profile in The Financial Times, in one of the designers last interviews, Alexander Fury wrote: He put women into a uniform of suits just as radical as Chanels, creating forceful, confident clothing that helped to power the working womans social revolution of the 1980s.\n\nBy contrast, he relaxed menswear, deconstructing traditional tailoring in a manner that has affected how just about every suit in the world is made.\n\nA friend of Hollywood, he understood the power of publicity and dressed some of its biggest stars for the red carpet including for the Oscars  including Zendaya, Cate Blanchett and Julia Roberts.\n\nHe also designed stage outfits for Lady Gaga and various costumes for films American Gigolo and The Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nEven as he entered his 10th decade, Armani continued to present new collections on the French and Italian catwalks.\n\nHis March 2025 show was designed to make a statement on global politics, with him stating that he wanted to imagine new harmony as he believed that is what we all need.\n\nConcern over his health was first expressed in June this year, when he missed Milan fashion week.\n\nHe directed a couture show in Paris in July 2025, but did this remotely from his home in Milan.\n\nArmani was described as a true gentleman and titan of the industry by Vogues Laura Ingham, who paid tribute to the late designer.\n\nShe added: If you dont know anything about fashion, youll still know Giorgio Armani. Mr. Armani built a house synonymous with timeless Italian elegance and enduring style.\n\nReferencing his classic style, which included refined silhouettes and immaculate tailoring, she concluded that his legacy is woven not only into fashions past and present but will continue to shape its future for generations to come.\n\nStarting his career in medicine, he moved to fashion in the 1960s and set up his own luxury label in 1975 alongside his late partner Sergio Galeotti.\n\nHe faced much criticism during his career, including in 2015 when he said a gay man does not need to dress homosexual.\n\nHis company also reached a financial settlement with Italian tax authorities over offshore subsidiaries in 2014, though no wrongdoing was admitted.\n\nAway from fashion, he was a keen sports fan and supported Serie A football team Inter Milan and owned the Olimpia Milano basketball team.\n\nThe fashion brand also had a partnership with the Scuderia Ferrari F1 team, with one of their drivers, Charles Leclercwriting on Instagramthat it was a great honour to have had the chance to meet and work with such an amazing person.\n\nArmani was also presented with the French Legion of Honour and Italian Order of Merit for Labour for his work in fashion.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nAT the heart of Westprops most ambitious urban development, Pomona City, a quiet revolution is underway  one that does not just build homes, but redefines how cities breathe, grow, and sustain themselves. At the centre of this transformation stands a $1 million biodigester facility, a bold move that signals a new era of infrastructure-led community building.\n\nThe Pomona City project, the brainchild of chief executive Mr Ken Sharpe, is not just a real estate project but a philosophy. Designed as a self-contained enclave where residents can live, work, shop, and play, the development is anchored in the belief that modern urban life must be both convenient and ecologically responsible. WestProps investment in wastewater treatment is a testament to that vision.\n\nWith the capacity to treat up to 6 million litres of wastewater daily, the biodigester facility is more than a utility  it is a statement. It ensures that Pomona Citys growth does not come at the expense of the environment, and that sustainability is not an afterthought but a foundational principle.\n\nIn a city where urban sprawl often outpaces infrastructure, WestProps decision to prioritize wastewater management is both rare and radical. The biodigesters not only reduce environmental strain but also support long-term health, hygiene, and resilience for thousands of future residents.\n\nThis is not just about pipes and pumps  it is about dignity and creating a city where families do not have to worry about sanitation, where businesses can thrive without infrastructure bottlenecks, and where urban planning meets global benchmarks.\n\nThe biodigester system also opens the door to circular resource use. Treated water can be repurposed for landscaping, construction, or even watering the Pomona City orchard use within the developmentturning waste into opportunity and reinforcing Pomona Citys ethos of regenerative living.\n\nObservers have begun noting that Westprop has consistently pushed the boundaries of what is possible in Zimbabwean real estate. From smart city ambitions to green infrastructure.\n\nPomona City is a living portfolio of innovation. The biodigester facility is just one chapter in a larger storyone where urban evolution meets strategic foresight.\n\n",
