            "content": "By Dumani Moyo I The South African\n\nSOUTH African activist and March in March founder Jacinta Ngobese-Zuma has stirred controversy after blasting Zimbabwean men living in South Africa, calling them cowards who have abandoned their country instead of fixing it.\n\nNgobese-Zuma made the remarks during an interview with Gagasi FMs Siphumelele Zondi, following comments from Mduduzi Dube, a Zimbabwean man living in South Africa, who raised concerns about growing tensions between locals and migrants.Zimbabwe is not a province of South AfricaDube told Gagasi FM that the atmosphere in South Africa has grown increasingly hostile towards foreign nationals, citing the rise of anti-immigrant movements such as Operation Dudula.He argued that politicians and activists often use the immigration issue for popularity, saying, Anybody who wants to go into politics and gain immediate attention must make noise about foreigners.Dube added that historically, South Africans and foreigners coexisted peacefully until groups like Operation Dudula emerged.However, Ngobese-Zuma dismissed his claims, accusing Zimbabweans of entitlement.I think Zimbabweans first of all need to understand that Zimbabwe is not a province of South Africa. This entitlement they have to South Africa is sickening.She added that the more South African government keeps nursing Zimbabweans and making them feel like they have rights, the more they start believing they have bigger rights than South Africans.Ngobese-Zuma said the influx of undocumented Zimbabweans has created resentment among locals, describing their attitude as intrusive and entitled.Ngobese-Zuma: Zimbabwean men have become cowardsThe activist went further, calling Zimbabwean men cowards for fleeing their country instead of confronting their political leadership.The reason we have entitled people like Dube here is because the men of Zimbabwe have become cowards. They no longer want to fight for Zimbabwe, they want to fight for South Africa, she said.She urged Zimbabweans to return home and challenge President Emmerson Mnangagwas regime instead of depending on South Africa for economic refuge.Whether there is Operation Dudula or March in March, that is none of Zimbabweans business. Their job is to fix their country, she said.Ngobese-Zuma urges Zimbabweans to Go back home and fix their countryShe lamented the growing number of Zimbabweans crossing into South Africa, accusing them of using migration as a shortcut rather than addressing the root causes of their countrys crisis.Now every minute someone in Zimbabwe has a problem, the solution is to come to South Africa. What kind of solution is that? Who is staying behind in Zimbabwe?

Biti and other opposition figures were scheduled to speak at the ill-fated event.Responding to the latest police deployment, Biti said he was being targeted for defending constitutionalism and speaking out against authoritarianism.The police barricade at our law firm is an unlawful and unconstitutional invasion of our right to work. We are a peaceful, law-abiding group. We have a right to freedom of movement, association and speech.We are being targeted for our consistency and principled position against autocracy and dictatorship. We are being targeted for our defence of the Constitution and our firm rejection of the 2030 Agenda.We are being targeted for our firm stance against corruption and its principal disciples, some of whom now hold presidential ambitions, Biti said.Meanwhile, Bitis lawyer Jeremiah Bamu said they had engaged police and were assured that neither Biti nor his law firm is under investigation, with officers insisting they were only carrying out routine law and order duties in the area.\n\nBiti, a staunch critic of President Emmerson Mnangagwas rule, is among opposition politicians campaigning against Zanu PFs illegal plan to extend the 83-year-old rulers term beyond 2028.\n\nHeavy police presence at Bitis law chambers on Saturday was reportedly in anticipation of a possible gathering by the Constitution Defence Forum, which Biti leads in its push against the 2030 Agenda.About three weeks ago, the Southern Africa Political Economy Series (SAPES) Trust premises were petrol-bombed and a security guard was abducted, in what is believed to be another attempt to stop discussions around the political move to perpetuate Mnangagwas incumbency.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA FRESH wave of abductions and torture is unravelling in Zimbabwe amid a pushback against President Emmerson Mnangagwas regimes attempt to extend his incumbency beyond 2028.\n\nKnown and perceived critics of Mnangagwas plot are now targeted for abduction, torture and possible disappearances. Those lucky to face the law will be charged with violating the controversial Patriotic Act, a Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) intelligence officer told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nRecently, activist Godfrey Karembera, popularly known as Madzibaba Veshanduko, was reportedly seized by unidentified men, later found in State custody, and allegedly beaten and denied medical care, according to rights groups and independent media.\n\nPolice claim he faces charges under Zimbabwes Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act and are signalling possible use of the Patriotic Act (2023)  a controversial amendment that criminalises conduct deemed to injure the sovereignty and national interest of Zimbabwe.\n\nKaremberas detention betrays a broader climate in which dissent is met with State-linked violence, opaque charges, and expansive security laws, a senior police intelligence officer told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nOnly last week, two student activists from Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) were abducted and tortured. Lindon Zanga (21) and Malvin Madanda (29), who belong to a students union aligned to the opposition, were on November 10 abducted, tortured and dumped by unknown assailants over impending students council elections.\n\nThe recent cases of abductions and torture have reignited concern over a rising pattern targeting government critics.\n\nThese cases fit a long-standing pattern of targeted abductions and intimidation of opposition figures, students, and activists, said Lemuel Mukandawire, a human rights defender.\n\nAs rights organisations, we argue that the Patriotic Acts wording is vague and enables abuse and suppresses legitimate political organising.\n\nThough parts of the 2023 law have been challenged in court, key provisions remain in force and continue to be invoked.\n\nThe legislation, Mukandawire said, is also meant to silence activism beyond Zimbabwes borders.\n\nAuthorities from the Mnangagwa establishment are reportedly closely watching organisers ofdemonstrations inother countries against the 83-year-old Zanu PF leader, whose administration is blamed economic decay that is resulting in droves leaving the country for greener pastures.\n\nThere is a long watchlist of with names of diaspora activists such as Tanyaradzwa Emily Daka, Francis Mubani, Xoliso Sithole, Mollin Muteto, Cretah Mupfudze, Dadirayi Mukwedeya, Ralph Dube, Elizabeth Chitengo, Happiness Ncube, Edgar Mancini, Eness Mapungwana, Nkululeko Ndlovu, Melody Talent Mkwenje, Prince Justin Chihurani, Josephine Mudimbu and others, who are of interest.\n\nZimbabweans in the UK are watching closely, as authorities have hinted that the same law may be applied to those accused of coordinating political activity abroad. The police source cited meetings that took place before and after the failed demonstration in Zimbabwe, further said the police source.\n\nMeetings held in South Africa, UK in Durham led by Shepherd Yuda and Patson Muzuwa, among others, have reportedly rattled President Emmerson Mnangagwas regime accused of running down the economy and gross human rights violations.\n\nRights groups continue to call for independent investigation, medical access, and protection of fundamental freedoms as fears grow that transnational repression may widen.\n\n",
