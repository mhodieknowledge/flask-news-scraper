Where must they do business? In Zimbabwe? Out of this country?  Mashatile asked on Tuesday.\n\nThey can do business, as long as Im not involved, not because they know me. Because once you say Mr Mashatile is capable of influencing, even if he is sitting in his house, its unfair. You must be able to say he went there to interfere.\n\nThe deputy president stressed that only Trade and Industry Minister Parks Tau had the authority to select the winning bidder.\n\nTau announced Sizekhaya as the winner on 28 May after a lengthy evaluation process and has since promised Parliament that any allegations of conflicts of interest will be investigated.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Esther Muremba has slapped a 24-year-old Shamva man with a 30-year jail term following his conviction for killing an artisanal miner in cold blood back in 2019.\n\nClaude Makoto was convicted after a full trial with the court hearing that he was only 18 when he killed Christopher Samu, a 37-year-old man, on 3 August 2019 at Nherera Mine in Shamva.\n\nIt was proved that Makoto was part of a gang that included Onias Sindura, Robert Sindura, Tinashe Zvinairo, Bhaureni Chingwaru, Lloyd Kafena, Charles Mhako, Kudakwashe Gutsa, Kudakwashe Karima, and one Jabulani.\n\nOn the fateful day the gang travelled to Nherera Mine in a Toyota Noah, intending to rob gold ore.\n\nUpon arrival, they encountered the deceased and his brother, Shame Samu, who were working at the mine.\n\nThe gang manhandled the deceased, while Shame managed to escape.\n\nThey then assaulted Christopher Samu indiscriminately using various weapons, before dragging him and disposing of his body in a shallow pit near the Mazowe River bank, the court heard.\n\nHis body was discovered the following day, 4 August 2019.\n\nOf the six witnesses presented by the State, only Shame, the brother of the deceased, testified in person during the trial.\n\nThe court found Makoto guilty of murder and his lawyers had proposed a sentence not exceeding 20 years, citing the accuseds age at the time of the offence.\n\nIt was argued that he succumbed to peer pressure due to his youthfulness.\n\nThe lawyers also submitted that the accused, who is a gold panner, got married in 2021 while out on bail and now has a child.\n\nBut the judge said a stiffer penalty was appropriate, taking into consideration that the lawlessness in mining communities is a serious concern.\n\nPeople engaged in gold panning often show no respect for human life, resorting to violence without hesitation.\n\nWhile the accused was young, he willfully participated in an organised gang, engaging in murder during a robberya crime that demands severe punishment, regardless of age, to deter others from exploiting youthfulness as an excuse for criminal behaviour.\n\nGiven the devastating impact of this murder on the deceaseds family, a sentence beyond 20 years imprisonment is warranted, the judge said.\n\nThe court heard Samus firstborn was unable to sit for O-Level examinations due to financial hardship.\n\nHis widow and three children are struggling, forced to survive on menial jobs, while his elderly mother, once dependent on him, has developed a heart condition following his death.\n\nNeither the accused nor his gang members have offered any compensation or contributed towards funeral expenses, further exacerbating the familys struggle.\n\nA sentence of 30 years imprisonment as proposed by the State is just and necessary, reflecting the gravity of the offence and its lasting consequences.\n\nMuremba also said the sentence has been influenced by the fact that the accused is a first offender and was 18 years old at the time of the offence.\n\nHad he been older, we would have readily imposed a life sentence, especially now that the death penalty has been abolished.\n\nBefore its abolishment, capital punishment was the appropriate and fitting penalty for murder committed in the course of a robbery.\n\nAccordingly, the accused is sentenced to 30 years imprisonment, she ruled.\n\n",

            "content": "Agencies\n\nAt least 16 people have been killed in nationwide rallies against police brutality and government corruption in Kenya, according to Amnesty International and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights.\n\nAnother 400 people were injured on Wednesday, including protesters, police and journalists. The casualties included people hit by live fire and others who were wounded by rubber bullets, or were beaten, and were primarily in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.\n\nDemonstrators had clashed with police, who hurled tear gas canisters and wielded batons. The protests mark one year since people stormed parliament at the peak of antigovernmentdemonstrations.\n\nThousands took to the streets to commemorate last years youth-led demonstrations against tax rises, during which at least 60 people were killed by security forces, according to rights groups.\n\nAmong the crowds in the capital, some waved Kenyan flags and placards with pictures of demonstrators killed last year and chanted Ruto must go, referring to President William Ruto, whose proposed tax hikes triggered last years youth-led protests.\n\nIve come here as a Kenyan youth to protest. It is our right for the sake of our fellow Kenyans who were killed last year. The police are here  they are supposed to protect us, but they kill us, Eve, a 24-year-old woman, told the AFP news agency.\n\nIt is extremely important that the young people mark June 25th because they lost people who look like them, who speak like them  who are fighting for good governance, said Angel Mbuthia, chair of the youth league for the opposition Jubilee Party.\n\nProtesters also gathered in various other parts of the country, including in the town of Matuu, approximately 100km (62 miles) from the capital, where there were reports of clashes.\n\nPolice blocked main roads leading into the capitals central business district, while government buildings were barricaded with razor wire.\n\nThe government ordered TV and radio stations to halt live coverage of the protests.\n\nNetBlocks, a global internet tracker, said social media platform Telegram had been restricted. And Kenyan broadcaster KTN was taken off the air later on Wednesday, a senior official at its parent company, Nation Media Group, said.\n\nAl Jazeeras Malcolm Webb, reporting from Nairobi, said protests across the country have been met with a lot of violence by the police.\n\nAbout a dozen people have been treated for gunshot wounds, he said, citing local media reports.\n\nKenyas Citizen TV reported that protesters torched court facilities in Kikuyu on the outskirts of Nairobi.\n\nIsolated clashes were reported in the port city of Mombasa, according to NTV, with protests also in the towns of Kitengela, Kisii, Matuu and Nyeri.\n\nThe anniversary comes amid soaring anger aboutpolice brutality, particularly after 31-year-old blogger and teacher, Albert Ojwang, was killed in custody earlier this month following his arrest for criticising a senior officer.\n\nSix people, including three police officers, were charged with murder on Tuesday for Ojwangs killing. They have all pleaded not guilty.\n\nPolice have said protests are permitted as long as they are peaceful and unarmed.\n\nBut a group of peaceful protesters was attacked last week by a large gang of motorbike-riding goons, as they are known in Kenya, armed with whips and clubs and working in tandem with the police.\n\nOn Tuesday, the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and other Western nations released a joint statement on X urging all involved to facilitate peaceful demonstrations and to refrain from violence.\n\nThe use of plain clothed officers in unmarked vehicles erodes public trust, the statement said. Rights campaigners condemned the presence of unidentified police officers at protests last year.\n\nKenyas Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement late on Tuesday that any policing violations would be addressed through government institutions, including the parliament and the judiciary.\n\nThe ministry reminds all that diplomatic partnerships flourish best in mutual respect, open channels and a recognition of each others unique governance contexts, it said.\n\nThere is also growing resentment among young people towards Ruto, who came to power in 2022, promising rapid economic progress.\n\nMany have been disillusioned by continued stagnation, corruption and high taxes, even after last years protests forced Ruto to cancel an unpopular finance bill. His government has been at pains to avoid direct tax rises this year.\n\nBut the frequent disappearances of government critics  rights groups have counted more than 80 since last years protests, with dozens still missing  have led many to accuse Ruto of returning Kenya to the dark days of its dictatorship in the 1980s and 90s.\n\nRuto previously promised an end to abductions but was unapologetic in a speech on Tuesday, pledging to stand by the police.\n\nYou cannot use force against the police or insult, or threaten the police, he warned protesters. You are threatening our nation.\n\n",
