            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has ordered a private security guard and his employer, Javelin Trading (Pvt) Ltd, to pay nearly US$49,000 in damages to a Nyabira police officer and farmer, who was left permanently disabled after being shot in the back during a farm patrol.\n\nJustice Gladys Mhuri ruled that guard Casten Suwedi acted negligently when he opened fire on Calisto Mujera at Gwebi South Farm on April 26, 2020, leaving him partially paralysed. The court found Javelin Trading, which employed and armed Suwedi, vicariously liable.The second defendant did not shout at the person to stop. He aimed at the vehicle without ascertaining whether there were any people there. A reasonable person exercising due care would have foreseen that aiming at the motor vehicle he was likely to hit a person, Justice Mhuri said.I find, therefore, that the second defendant was negligent and his negligence caused the plaintiff to sustain the injuries which left him disabled.Mujera had sued for US$331,590 in special and general damages, claiming loss of income, farming produce, medical bills and future expenses.The court, however, trimmed the award to US$48,920.66, covering verified medical, transport, and farm losses, as well as compensation for pain, suffering and loss of amenities.General damages are not a penalty but compensation, Justice Mhuri stressed.The award is designed to compensate the victim and not to punish the wrongdoer.According to testimony, Mujera was driving with his son on the evening of April 26, 2020, when he stopped near Javelin Farm after noticing suspicious movements. As he disembarked to inspect his overheating car, Suwedi, who was on patrol, shone a torch from the maize field and fired a shot, hitting Mujera in the back.I shouted that I was a police officer, Mujera testified, adding that no warning shot was given.All I saw was a light and then I heard a bang.The bullet left shrapnel lodged in his spine, causing permanent damage to his lower body. He spent weeks at Parirenyatwa Hospital and months at Chikurubi Police Hospital, undergoing treatment and physiotherapy. Medical reports confirmed he will live with chronic pain, weakness and loss of function in his lower limbs.Mujera told the court the injuries destroyed his farming business, cost him his formal employment, and left him humiliated after local media reports suggested he had been shot while stealing maize. He and his son were later acquitted of theft charges in the Norton Magistrates Court.Suwedi argued that he had caught Mujera and others harvesting maize under cover of night and claimed he fired only after giving a warning. But the judge dismissed his version, describing him as not a truthful witness who gave conflicting accounts of the shooting.Javelin Trading, which provided Suwedi with a firearm despite his lack of formal weapons training, chose not to lead any evidence in its defence. The court held it responsible as the employer.In the circumstances, first defendant is liable for the second defendants actions and the resultant injuries suffered by plaintiff, Mhuri ruled.The court granted Mujera US$33,920.66 in special damages, including medical and transport costs and farm income losses, US$10,000 for pain, suffering, and permanent disablement, US$5,000 for loss of amenities, including the inability to perform normal family and social functions.In total, US$48,920.66 is to be paid jointly by Javelin Trading and Suwedi, with one paying absolving the other.\n\nJustice Gladys Mhuri ruled that guard Casten Suwedi acted negligently when he opened fire on Calisto Mujera at Gwebi South Farm on April 26, 2020, leaving him partially paralysed.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has ruled in favour of top businessman and lawyer Tawanda Nyambirais company, TN Baker (Pvt) Ltd, in a bitter property dispute, ordering the eviction of AmarisSA (Pvt) Ltd from a contested section of prime Harare real estate.Justices Faith Mushure and Joseph Chilimbe set aside a magistrates court decision and held that TN Baker had a valid lease for 17 Samora Machel Avenue, while AmarisSA had unlawfully encroached onto its premises.The appeal is allowed with costs, Justice Mushure wrote.The application for eviction be and is hereby granted the respondent and all those claiming occupation through it are ordered to vacate forthwith.The ruling ends a long-running feud between the two companies over shops and a delivery panhandle within the commercial property.TN Baker argued it was paying rentals for 711 square metres but was only occupying 668 square metres, with AmarisSAs subtenants taking up part of its leased space.AmarisSA denied the encroachment, arguing that there were material disputes of fact and insisting TN Baker had no locus standi. But the judges dismissed that stance, finding the encroachment was backed by an expert surveyors report which went uncontested.This is a typical case where the court was confronted by a mere allegation of a possible dispute of fact, Justice Mushure said. The holder of a lease has a clear right derived from the lease agreement to take occupation of the property leased to him and to sue for the eviction of any illegal occupier.The court ordered that if AmarisSA fails to vacate voluntarily, the Messenger of Court must immediately enforce the eviction.The legal battle has its roots in a complex history of leases involving TN Baker, its sister companies, and property owner Glicknett Investments. In 2016, AmarisSA relinquished its rights to No. 17 Samora Machel Avenue, acknowledging that TN entities would negotiate directly with Glicknett. TN Baker subsequently secured a direct lease, valid until October 2026.Despite that, disputes flared again in 2024 when TN Baker accused AmarisSA of encroachment. The magistrates court dismissed TN Bakers application, but the High Court has now cleared the way for eviction.Lawyers Beatrice Mtetwa & Tawanda Nyambirai Legal Practitioners represented TN Baker, while James Majatame Attorneys acted for AmarisSA.\n\nTHE High Court has ruled in favour of top businessman and lawyer Tawanda Nyambirais company, TN Baker (Pvt) Ltd, in a bitter property dispute, ordering the eviction of AmarisSA (Pvt) Ltd from a contested section of prime Harare real estate.\n\nJustices Faith Mushure and Joseph Chilimbe set aside a magistrates court decision and held that TN Baker had a valid lease for 17 Samora Machel Avenue, while AmarisSA had unlawfully encroached onto its premises.The appeal is allowed with costs, Justice Mushure wrote.The application for eviction be and is hereby granted the respondent and all those claiming occupation through it are ordered to vacate forthwith.The ruling ends a long-running feud between the two companies over shops and a delivery panhandle within the commercial property.TN Baker argued it was paying rentals for 711 square metres but was only occupying 668 square metres, with AmarisSAs subtenants taking up part of its leased space.AmarisSA denied the encroachment, arguing that there were material disputes of fact and insisting TN Baker had no locus standi.

The struggle against corruption is necessary to have resources necessary for proper investigation, bring in those responsible to the courts.I was talking to police officers and what they said is the situation even got worst because they are not able to bring the person accused of corruption to the court due to absence of transportation, they are also not able to do forensic expertise especially in the IT sphere, because of the impossibility to procure and deliver necessary equipment and they are not able to do online court hearing because of unavailability of equipment, she added.Thandiwe Garusas reporting on the UN Human Rights Councils 60th session in Geneva has been sponsored by the Friedrich Naumann Foundation and the Universal Rights Group.\n\nGENEVA: ZIMBABWE has heightened its call for the removal of sanctions at the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Councils 60th session, saying that the punitive measures have fuelled brain drain, crippling key economic sectors and undermining the delivery of critical services.\n\nSpeaking at one of the sessions in Geneva, Switzerland, recently, Justice Permanent Secretary Vimbai Nyemba told the council sanctions-induced economic hardships had triggered a mass exodus of skilled professionals, company closures and unemployment, among other vices.Due to sanctions induced economic hardships, Zimbabwe has experienced brain drain, which has impacted on key sectors and critical services.Loss of direct foreign investment has led to closure of businesses and job losses.Not only has sanctions negatively affected the governments ability to provide basic economic and social rights but also its capacity to adequately finance social protection programmes and develop and maintain infrastructure, necessary performances and delivery of critical services.Our development agenda in the achievement of SDGs has been severely undermined by Unilateral Coercive Measures (UMCs), we continue to call for lifting of all the UMCs and reiterate the need for UN agencies to monitor and report on the impact of UCMs, secondary sanctions and compliance on the enjoyment of human rights in targeted countries, Nyemba said.Another Southern African country, Namibia, also voiced for sanctions removal on Zimbabwe.At a separate press conference on the sidelines of the UN Human Rights Councils 60th session, Alena Douhan, UN Special Rapporteur on the negative impact of the UCM on the enjoyment of human rights, also said the targeted sanctions on Zimbabwe are affecting the whole country and causing human rights violations.It has been traditionally insisted that targeted sanctions imposed against bad guys only do not affect human rights in Zimbabwe at all but in reality, my country visit to Zimbabwe has clearly demonstrated that it is absolutely misleading to talk about targeted sanctions today because the majority of people who are in the designated list are high State officials and traditionally as soon as for example the minister of health is affected, the whole public health sector is affected sometimes even the private one.Douhan also raised concerns over serious corruption in Zimbabwe, which together with sanctions is worsening human rights violations.What I observed during my visit is that Zimbabwe has a serious problem with corruption.

It claims the decision to relieve Obert Mpofu of his office as Zanu PF Secretary-General was taken under Article 9, sections 65 and 67.\n\nArticle 9 concerns Politburo functions generally and does not confer authority for the First Secretary to reassign office-holders. Section 65 addresses the functions of the Secretary for Economic Development and Empowerment; section 67 addresses the functions of the Secretary for Healthcare of the Child and the Elderley.\n\nNeither provision authorises the personnel change Mutsvangwa communicates. For that reason, the letter does not effect a lawful change of office, said Mpofu in post on X.\n\nThe Politburo reshuffle was viewed by political observers as a move to consolidate power by President Mnangagwa ahead of the partys conference scheduled for Mutare next month.\n\nZanu PF is torn into two factions, one backing Mnangagwa to rule beyond the constitutionally mandated two terms, with the other supporting Constantino Chiwenga to succeed him.\n\nMpofu further said Mnangagwa might have erred in instituting his sweeping reassignments.\n\nNothing in the Zanu PF Constitution vests the First Secretary with the unilateral power to make the reassignments announced. Section 54 is clear on this as it sets out the full remit of his powers.\n\nIn fact, in terms of section 49 the power to appoint heads is exercised during Congress and not anytime thereafter. A power not enshrined in the Constitution cannot lawfully be exercised.\n\nAccordingly, if the position is maintained that the First Secretary lacks authority to reassign Mpofu et al, and that position is not accepted, a dispute arises mandating resolution. In the meantime, its back to original settings, said Mpofu.\n\n",

For almost two decades, it sparked conversations in homes, workplaces and social media spaces, providing entertainment that felt authentically local.\n\nIt gave local actors, writers, directors, and production teams a platform to showcase their talents while telling South African stories.\n\nHelga Palmer, group head of local programming and strategy at eMedia, captured the bittersweet nature of this farewell:We are proud of what Scandal! has achieved, not only as a top-rated television property but also as a vital part of South Africas cultural landscape.\n\nWe thank the entire production team, the cast past and present, and our loyal viewers for making this journey extraordinary.\n\ne.tv has extended heartfelt gratitude to Ochre Media, the production company that brought Scandal! to life throughout its run.\n\nStan Joseph, executive producer at Ochre Moving Pictures, reflected on what the series has meant to everyone involved:Producing Scandal! has been an incredible journey and a true labour of love. For close to twenty years, our writers, directors, actors and crew have poured their hearts into bringing authentic South African stories to life.\n\nJoseph continued: We are deeply grateful to e.tv for their trust and to our audiences for their unwavering support. While it is bittersweet to say goodbye, we are proud of the legacy that Scandal! leaves behind.\n\nScandal! will continue to air until the end of June 2026, giving viewers time to process this goodbye while ensuring the series receives the send-off it deserves.\n\nFor fans, this means they have a few more months to savour every episode, every plot twist, every character moment.\n\n",
