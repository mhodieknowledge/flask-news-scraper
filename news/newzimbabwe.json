            "content": "VOA\n\nZimbabwe is working with the International Atomic Energy Agency and Russian investors to establish nuclear energy as part of its efforts to end the countrys chronic power shortages, government officials said Thursday.\n\nThe nation has expressed its interest in nuclear power to the IAEA, said Edgar Moyo, Minister of Energy and Power Development, and hopes to develop small, modular reactors.\n\nThey have indicated their willingness to take us through paces until we get there, Moyo told journalists.\n\nEstablishing nuclear power is expensive and complex, said Joseph Siegle, the director of research at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, which is the reason countries such as South Africa and Egypt have sought Russias assistance.\n\nThe process is also ripe for corruption, he said, so transparency is critical.\n\nMost economists would argue that those deals cost far more than are warranted for the benefits that they would provide to their economies and to their societies, Siegle said, and so theres a worry that these huge infrastructure projects become a source of corruption, both in the country where it is being built, but also vis-a-vis the state-owned enterprises that the Russians provide to build the plant.\n\nIn the end, it becomes the public in the country that is building the plant that would be responsible for paying off these costs, he said.\n\nZimbabwe says its goal is to have 4,000 megawatts of power capacity by 2035 and end years of power cuts that can sometimes last up to 18 hours per day.\n\nSiegle said Zimbabwes power needs do not warrant a traditional large-scale nuclear reactor and suggested that the government study the lasting impact of waste disposal.\n\n[This] has always been a concern with nuclear energy  what you do with the waste, which requires some 10,000 years for the radioactive elements to decay and not pose a health risk to society, he said.\n\nNuclear power also heightens security risks, Siegle said.\n\nGloria Magombo, secretary for energy and power development, said at the media briefing that Zimbabwe aims to increase the use of other renewable energies besides hydropower, given the nations recurring droughts.\n\nShe mentioned solar, wind and mini-hydro stations.\n\nWe are we are looking at coming in by 2030 with up to about 2,000 megawatts from those sources, Magombo said.\n\nZimbabwes current capacity for power generation is about 2,600 megawatts, according to the government. The actual daily generation is roughly half of that.\n\n",

            "content": "AP\n\nBatsirai Pabwe picked detergents, toothpaste, snacks and some pasta among several grocery items spread on the tarmac of a car parking space  an unorthodox night bazaar lit by cellphone flashlights and fluorescent lamps inZimbabwescapital, Harare.\n\nTraditional stores are struggling to survive as the volatility ofZimbabwes new currency pushes prices up. Many like Pabwe now shun them for much cheaper informal markets that pop up at night to avoid the glare of authorities.\n\nFrom dusk, sidewalks, store or office verandahs and car parking spaces burst into unorthodox open air bazaars, offering anything from groceries to fresh meat, electronics, clothes, medicines, fashion accessories and stationery.\n\nUnfettered by expenses such as rising energy costs, taxes and laws that force formal retailers to accept the local currency at artificially low official exchange rates, informal traders, including children, offer better bargains. A box of juice that sells for $3 in a supermarket costs half of that on the street.\n\nIts my first time shopping here. My friend told me that its much cheaper than the supermarkets, 30-year-old Pabwe said, visibly relieved as he filled up a plastic bag with items for just $20. I decided to give it a try and I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe once-prosperous southern African nation of 15 million people in April introduced a new gold-backed currency called ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, to replace one that had been battered by depreciation and often outright rejection by the people.\n\nIt is the countrys sixth attempt at a new currency since the spectacular 2009 collapse of the Zimbabwe dollar and adoption of the U.S. dollar as legal tender amid hyperinflation of 5 billion percent, one of the worlds worst currency crashes to date. The U.S. dollar has since remained legal tender alongside successive local currencies.\n\nThe latest currency, the worlds newest, came with pomp and fanfare  promotional catchy jingles and songs played repeatedly on public radio, television and online.\n\nSeven months on, the ZiG seems to be tanking, like its predecessors. The gap between official and black market exchange rates continues to widen, with many people and informal traders who dominate the economy again preferring the more stable dollar.\n\nTraditional stores, forced by authorities to charge using the local currency, are increasing prices to make ends meet. But they have also become uncompetitive against unregulated informal markets, the Retailers Association of Zimbabwe, an industry representative group, said in September.\n\nIt warned of store closures, saying the situation is clearly untenable.\n\nIn October, Pick n Pay, one of Africas biggest grocery chains that operates more than 70 stores jointly with a local partner in Zimbabwe, said that it had impaired its investment in Zimbabwe to a book value of zero because of the deteriorating economic conditions.\n\nIn every transaction business is doing in the formal setup, its making an exchange rate loss that cannot be compensated. The major issue here is a currency crisis, said Gift Mugano, an economics professor. Huge overheads worsen the retailers situation.\n\nEverything is against their survival. The informal sector works at night, (if there is) no electricity they use their phones, they dont care. They are there for survival, Mugano said.\n\nThe contrast is palpable in Harares Central Business District, where only a few shoppers solemnly scanned prices in a supermarket on a recent day.\n\nSoothing music played from speakers inside but was drowned out by the buzz created outside by hordes of street vendors shouting out bargains to a sea of shoppers.\n\nBusiness is booming, said Oswald Gari, a vendor, adding that he only works at night when the police leave.\n\nGari, 51, said hes fending for his six children and four nephews under his care from the night trade. He harbors no hope of finding formal employment in a country where once roaring industrial sites are being turned into giant warehouses for imported goods, many which end up on the streets, and rail tracks are now overgrown with weeds.\n\nMore than 80% of Zimbabwes employable population ekes out a living in the informal sector, according to official figures and the International Labor Organization.\n\nFor Pabwe, shopping from the informal night markets means less headaches.\n\nIts quite confusing, especially for people like me who really dont understand the value of the ZiG. I always get confused when I get into supermarkets, he said.\n\nHe was satisfied with his shopping at night bazaar.\n\nI got everything I was looking for and the pricing is really affordable. I actually managed to buy a handful for just $20. I even got my washing powder and dishwashing liquid, he said. I think I will do this more often.\n\n",

            "content": "AP\n\nAngelina JolieandBrad Pitthave reached a divorce settlement, her lawyer said Monday, bringing an apparent end to one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history.\n\nJolies attorney James Simon confirmed to The Associated Press that the couple had come to a deal. News of the settlement was first reported by People magazine.\n\nMore than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt, Simon said in a statement. She and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\n\nNo court documents have been filed yet, and a judge will need to sign off on the agreement. An email late Monday night to Pitts attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.\n\nJolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, were among Hollywoods most prominent couples for 12 years. The two Oscar winners have six children together.\n\nJoliefiled for divorce in 2016,after a private jet flight from Europe during which she said Pitt was abusive toward her and their children. A judge in 2019declared them divorced and single,but the splitting of assets and child custody needed to be separately settled.\n\nA private judge that the two had hired to handle the case reached a decision soon after that included equal custody of their children, but Joliefiled to have him removedfrom the case over an unreported conflict of interest. An appeals court agreed, the judge was removed, and the couple had to start over.\n\nNo details of the agreement were immediately revealed, and the couples use of the private judge  an increasingly common move among splitting celebrities in recent years  has kept the proceedings largely under wraps. Some details, however, have been revealed through a separate lawsuit filed by Pitt, in which he alleged Jolie reneged on an agreement that she would sell him her half of a French winery the two owned together. Its not clear how the divorce agreement will affect that lawsuit.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe High Court has indefinitely reserved its judgement in a matter Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) leaders who were dismissed from their Parliamentary roles by the secretary general of the party, Sengezo Tshabangu are suing him.\n\nThe urgent High Court application was heard by Justice Neville Wamambo who promised to hand down his judgment on a later date.\n\nThe leaders include the interim party leader, Welshman Ncube and his deputy, Lynette Karenyi Kore, Sesel Zwidzai and Edwin Mushoriwa who filed an application citing their party as the first applicant.\n\nTshabangu recently dismissed the leaders from their parliamentary roles and appointed his selections in their place.\n\nTshabangu, the Speaker of the National Assembly, and Senator Nonhlahla Mlotshwa were cited as respondents in court papers\n\nThe applicants are seeking a court declaration that Tshabangus decisions to oust them from the Standing Rules and Orders Committee (SROC) are unlawful and exceed his constitutional authority.\n\nThey are also challenging Mlotshwas appointment as the CCC chief whip, claiming that such a position is not recognised under Section 151 (2) of the Constitution.\n\nAdditionally, they are contesting the reshuffling of various CCC members across different parliamentary committees to which they were originally assigned.\n\nThey seek an order to prevent the Speaker from announcing these changes in the National Assembly.\n\nIn the application, Ncube said Tshabangu will soon face disciplinary proceedings for what he did.\n\nOn Monday his lawyer Method Ndlovu told the judge that the Speaker quickly acted on Tshabangus actions but ignored several letters from his client.\n\nThere are several letters which were written by the applicants but they were ignored but he was so quick to act on the which was written by the second respondent, Ndlovu said.\n\nNcube said Tshabangu defied an existing court order barring him from recalling party members adding that the reshuffle was as good as recall.\n\nHis actions (Tshabangu) do not represent the collective decision of the CCC.\n\nHe was on a frolic of his own and what he did does not reflect the collective and correct position of the 1 Applicant (CCC).\n\nHe is a non-entity and it is surprising that the Speaker keeps entertaining him instead of the party, Ncube said in his founding affidavit when he filed the lawsuit.\n\nLewis Uriri and Nqobani Sithole representing Tshabangu said the High Court has no jurisdiction to hear Ncubes application.\n\nThe significance of the mootness was never lost. They became aware of their problem on December 16 but they already knew that parliament had accepted that there would be changes.\n\nThe juristic act had already taken place. All the speaker does is that I have to inform them that these changes have been made. They want to interrupt changes which have been made, Uriri said.\n\n",
