The announcement occurred just days after the Nobel Committee in Oslo announced that Venezuelan opposition leaderMaria Corina Machadohad won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for fighting dictatorship in the South American country.\n\nThe embassy closures with the two US allies also followed weeks of escalating tensions between Caracas and Washington.\n\nVenezuela has called on the UN for support over several deadly US military strikes on vessels off its Caribbean coast, which Washington alleges were carrying drugs.\n\nSome US allies on the UN Security Council called for de-escalation and dialogue.\n\nVenezuela has said it is in a situation where it is rational to expect an armed attack against the country in the short term, and Maduro has alleged the US is seeking a change in government.\n\nWashington has not responded to this accusation but has called Venezuelas socialist leader the illegitimate head of a narco-state. The US has also announced a new counter-narcotics task force in its Southern Command, a military branch that oversees Latin America.\n\nThe governments of Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso are more aligned with that of Russia, which has supported Venezuela at the UN and accused the US of acting according to the cowboy principle of shoot first.\n\n",

With so much focus on his fashion, its easy to wonder: Is he a music artist or a fashion icon?\n\nBut his artistry and influence suggest hes more than capable of balancing both worlds  and now, with Vuka up for Grammy consideration, the spotlight may finally shift toward his musical achievements.\n\nFor being on the list of the artists considered, Oscar responded, Thank you to everyone who keeps on streaming the music, attending shows, and getting merch, youre appreciated.\n\nOscars journey into music wasnt part of the original plan. After matriculating, his parents offered him a choice: a new car or R100,000 in cash. He chose the money and used it to invest in DJ equipment. With his entrepreneurial parents full support  and encouragement to pursue formal education  he began his career, carefully tracking every cent spent. Their belief in his vision laid the foundation for his success, and he remains deeply grateful for it.\n\nBeyond the decks and designer fits, Oscar is also a devoted family man.

A group of military personnel and politicians planned to assassinate me.\n\nI was forced to find a safe place to protect my life.\n\nThere is only one way to resolve these issues; that is to respect the constitution in force in the country.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Young people spearheaded nationwide rallies demanding a fairer deal for citizens\n\nOver the weekend, CAPSAT, a powerful army unit that helped install Rajoelina into power in 2009 moved to undermine him by declaring itself in command of all the armed forces, while some of its officers joined protesters on the streets of the capital, Antananarivo.\n\nFollowing a meeting of military commanders on Monday, the new Chief of Army Staff installed by CAPSAT, Gen Demosthene Pikulas, assured the public that the security forces were working together to maintain order in the island nation.\n\nBy Monday evening, the general was at state TV headquarters trying to resolve the crisis, according to a statement from the presidency.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, a senior leader in Madagascars largest opposition party, TIM, told the BBC that Madagascar was now effectively being run by the army unit.\n\nThe TIM party has also said that it plans to bring impeachment proceedings against Rajoelina for abandonment of post.\n\nSeveral of Rajoelinas inner circle have fled to nearby Mauritius. They include former Prime Minister President Richard Ravalomanana and the businessman Maminiaina Ravatomanga.\n\nDespite its abundant natural resources, Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world. About 75% of people there live below the poverty line, the World Bank says, while data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) shows just over one-third of people have access to electricity.\n\nThe protests began over anger with repeated water and power cuts, then escalated to reflect wider dissatisfaction with Rajoelinas government over high unemployment, corruption and the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nAt least 22 people were killed and more than 100 injured in the first few days of the protests, according to the UN, although the government has rejected these figures.\n\nEyewitnesses describe security officers opening fire on protesters with live ammunition. In one case,a newborn baby diedfrom smoke inhalation after being exposed to tear gas.\n\nMadagascar has been rocked by multiple uprisings since it gained independence in 1960, including mass protests in 2009 that forced then-President Marc Ravalomanana to step down and saw Rajoelina ushered into office.\n\nAged just 34 at the time, Rajoelina became Africas youngest leader  going on to govern for four years, then returning to power again after the 2018 election.\n\nRajoelina was born into wealth and, before entering politics, had made a name for himself as an entrepreneur and DJ  setting up a radio station and an advertising company along the way.\n\nBut his sharp-suited, baby-faced appeal soon waned, as allegations of cronyism and entrenched corruption became unshakeable.\n\n",

An order that there shall be no order as to costs is appropriate in the circumstances, Justice Deme ruled.\n\nDr Saidi remains barred from practising general medicine and must first lodge an appeal through the Health Professions Authority before seeking constitutional redress.\n\n",
