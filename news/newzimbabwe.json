We will continue to work tirelessly to combat the scourge of dangerous drugs, as it poses a significant threat to the well-being of our nation, read the statement.\n\nThe leniency of the judgement was castigated, with Zimbabwean government accused of being too soft on the Chinese with whom they have a good relationship.\n\nIn comparison, being found in possession of drugs in China is met with a harsher punishment, in some cases death penalty.\n\nNPA said the judicial system will be tightened against individuals found in drug peddling.\n\nThe NPAZ is taking concrete and decisive steps to ensure future prosecutions for drug-related offences are handled with the utmost efficiency and effectiveness.\n\nHenceforth, all Public Prosecutors have been instructed to prefer the correct charges in all drug-related cases, and ensure that they aggressively pursue stiffer sentences in court, to secure penalties that truly reflect the seriousness of these offences.\n\nThis stance is a direct reflection of the direction that Zimbabwe has taken to combat drug abuse, read the statement further.\n\n",

Now they dont have to look beyond Africa to get it, he said.\n\nMasiyiwa, who isworth about $1.3 billion, is known for building Econet Wireless into one of Africas largest telecom groups.\n\nIn recent years, he has expanded Cassava from telecoms into cloud computing, fintech, cybersecurity andartificial intelligence.\n\nThefirst AI factory is already under developmentin South Africa and will run on 3,000 Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nCassava says much of this computing power has already been reserved by African researchers and developers.\n\nCompany officials said the new facilities will help close a major gap in Africas digital economy.\n\nOnly about 5% of African AI talent currently has access to the high-performance computing power needed to train advanced AI models.\n\nBuilding local infrastructure could allow more African researchers to develop homegrown tools in sectors like finance, education, health and agriculture.\n\nCassava also plans to link the AI factories to its wider digital network, which includes Africa Data Centres, Liquid Intelligent Technologies, and Liquid C2.\n\nThese companies already provide data storage, internet connectivity and cybersecurity services across the continent.\n\nEarlier this year, Cassava launched a dedicated AI business unit and signed partnerships with global tech firms including Microsoft, AWS, Google and Anthropic to support African developers.\n\nAnalysts say the push could helpAfrica compete in the fast-growing global AI industrywhile keeping sensitive data on the continent.\n\nIt could also reduce costs for local startups and governments, who often pay high fees to store and process data overseas.\n\nIf completed on schedule, all five factories are expected to be operational by late 2026, positioning Cassava as one of the biggest builders of AI infrastructure in Africa.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe 14th edition of the Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba (ZAMI) kicked off in Bulawayo on Tuesday, with participants urging government and industry players to embrace mining initiatives that place people and communities at the centre of resource exploitation.\n\nZimbabwe is endowed with vast mineral wealth, including platinum-group metals (PGMs), chrome, lithium, gold, coal, diamonds, nickel, copper, black granite, and asbestos, alongside potential resources such as iron ore, tungsten, and semi-precious stones. Yet, despite this vast mineral basket, the majority of Zimbabweans continue to face economic hardship.\n\nThe Borgen Project estimates that 60% of the population lives on less than US$3.65 a day, making Zimbabwe one of the poorest countries in the SADC region. Rural communities, home to about 67% of the population, remain most vulnerable to food insecurity, drought, and economic shocks. Meanwhile, the health sector continues to struggle, with 87% of Zimbabweans lacking medical aid coverage and persistent shortages of medicines, staff, and resources worsened by an ongoing brain drain.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC) Secretary General Wilfred Dimingu described mining in the country as a story of plunder rather than stewardship.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, we have witnessed rivers polluted, communities displaced, and workers exploited in the name of short-term gains. This is not stewardship. It is idolatry, worshipping mammon over the Creator. Theologically, we are called to a different path, he said.\n\nDimingu stressed that sustainable development must be rooted in justice and fairness.\n\nThis means harnessing Zimbabwes minerals, particularly those critical for renewable energy and battery technologies, not through voracious extraction that scars the land and sidelines the poor, but through operations that ensure equity and sustainability, he added.\n\nZandile Mvududu, a project officer at Silveira House, emphasised the need for collaboration in shaping the extractive sectors future.\n\nStakeholders must continue to dialogue, hinging on the faith-based approach which we encourage in the districts we work in. The coming Mines and Minerals Bill presents an opportunity for communities to give input and resolve legacy issues in the sector, she said.\n\nProfessor Tumai Murombo, a legal and environmental expert from the University of the Witwatersrand (South Africa), echoed calls for reform, urging a total overhaul of Zimbabwes minerals governance and environmental management framework.\n\n",

I must assume that the evidence placed before me is true. There is evidence upon which a court, directing its mind reasonably to such evidence, could or might find for the plaintiff.\n\nThe church is challenging the validity of the trust that oversees its schools, accusing trustees of fraudulently registering it, mismanagement, and failing to account for funds. It is also seeking the trusts dissolution.\n\nCentral to the row are two deeds of trust allegedly registered under the same number in 2010 but with different founders  Reverends Paul Neshangwe and Wilbert Runyararo Sayimani. Both clergymen denied ever appearing before a notary to establish the trust, with Justice Mushure noting their testimonies raised prima facie irregularities.\n\nThe judge stressed that the trustees could not avoid scrutiny through legal technicalities.\n\nQuoting precedent, she said: A defendant who might be afraid to go into the witness box should not be permitted to shelter behind the procedure of absolution from the instance.\n\nThe case also raised red flags over school governance, with financial statements from 2013 to 2017 accounting for only three out of nine schools under the trust. Evidence was also led of trustees allegedly deriving personal benefits and parents expressing disquiet over mismanagement.\n\nRejecting the trustees argument that the church lacked authority to dissolve the trust, Justice Mushure noted: Under common law, the court has powers both to vary or terminate trusts in certain conditions  if the trust is being run contrary to the interests and objectives of the trust.\n\nThe trial is set to resume on September 25.\n\n",
