            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Supreme Court has dismissed an appeal by a Harare lawyer, Samantha Nhende, challenging a High Court ruling that found she was in a tacit universal partnership with her former partner, Andrew Zigora, effectively upholding the division of their jointly acquired property.\n\nThe ruling reinforces the growing judicial recognition of tacit universal partnerships in Zimbabwe, particularly in relationships governed by customary law but exhibiting economic interdependence and joint contribution akin to civil marriages.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, a tacit universal partnership can arise when a couple cohabitates without a formal marriage, and a court determines they were operating as a partnership based on their conduct.\n\nTo establish this, one must prove: each party contributed something to the partnership (money, labour, or skills), the business was for their joint benefit, and the objective was to make a profit.\n\nIn a recent judgment delivered by Justice Hlekani Mwayera, sitting with Justices Susan Mavangira and George Chiweshe, the court ruled that Nhendes appeal had no merit.\n\nThe court also confirmed the lower courts decision to allocate 55% of the property to Nhende and 45% to Zigora.\n\nThe appeal be and is hereby dismissed with no order as to costs, the Supreme Court ruled.\n\nThe parties entered into an unregistered customary law union on 1 August 2010 and later dissolved it in February 2021.\n\nThroughout the subsistence of the union, both parties were formally employed.\n\nNhende earned US$2,000 monthly as a legal officer, while Zigora was also formally employed by a leading telecommunications company, receiving a gross monthly salary of US$5,000.\n\nPrior to the parties entering into the customary law union, Nhende owned a stand in Manresa Suburb, which was allocated to her by her employer.\n\nZigora also owned a stand in Madokero Suburb.\n\nDuring the union, on 1 November 2015, the parties moved into a flat in Avondale.\n\nThey split financial responsibilities with Zigora responsible for paying rentals of US$550 per month and utilities.\n\nNhende was accountable for food, clothes and maintenance of the house.\n\nWith time, the parties agreed to purchase a property in Mabelreign.\n\nThey mutually secured a mortgage home loan facility through Nhendes bank. The title was thus in Nhendes name.\n\nZigoras stand in Madokero was used as collateral for the mortgage loan.\n\nHe also made deposits into Nhendes bank account, including payments for the home insurance of the property.\n\nZigora also made contributions towards the renovations of the property.\n\nThe parties also incurred and shared medical bills in their efforts to undergo medical procedures to help Nhende conceive.\n\nThe medical issue led to the fallout of the parties, culminating in the dissolution of their customary law union.\n\nZigora approached the court a quo seeking an order for the distribution of the matrimonial property of the parties.\n\nHe argued that the parties unregistered customary law union was a tacit universal partnership in which both parties contributed individually and collectively to the acquisition of the property.\n\nAfter obtaining the mortgage bond, Nhendes salary was centred on the repayments of the loan, whereas he catered for all other expenses, including the renovations of the property, as it had been purchased to be a matrimonial home.\n\nThe parties intended to raise a family on that property.\n\nNhende in the High Court averred that there was no tacit universal partnership between herself and the respondent, because they each managed their finances individually, even though they were staying as husband and wife.\n\nShe argued that the concept of tacit universal partnership does not apply to customary law unions.\n\nThe property in question, located at 2 Glynde Avenue, Mabelreign, was purchased during the parties unregistered customary law union, which lasted from August 2010 to February 2021.\n\nThough the property was registered in Nhendes name and the mortgage was drawn from her salary, the court found that Zigora contributed significantly to the household, renovations, and insurance, and had even offered his own property in Madokero as collateral for the mortgage loan.\n\nThe High Court had ruled that the property was jointly owned through a tacit universal partnershipa finding Nhende contested on appeal.\n\nNhendes legal counsel, Mr. T. Mapuranga, argued that the High Court erred in law by finding a tacit universal partnership without direct evidence of pooled finances or shared ownership intentions. He further contended that the court failed to consider Zigoras Madokero stand as part of the parties combined estate and that improvements made by Zigora should have been addressed under unjust enrichment rather than as contributions justifying ownership.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court disagreed.\n\nJustice Mwayera wrote: Their conduct during the acquisition and development of the property meets the requirements of a tacit universal partnership The parties consistently consulted each other on every intricate detail relating to the acquisition and renovation of the property.\n\nMwayera noted that the doctrine of tacit universal partnership applies where individuals in a close personal relationship contribute jointlyfinancially or otherwisefor their shared benefit, even outside a formal legal marriage.\n\nOn the issue of law application, the court reinforced that when customary law is inadequate to resolve a property dispute equitably, general law principles, such as tacit universal partnership and unjust enrichment, may justifiably be invoked.\n\nAddressing the division of the property, the court held that the High Court exercised its discretion judiciously by acknowledging both parties contributions.\n\nRegarding the Madokero property, the Supreme Court concurred with the respondents argument that it was irrelevant to the current dispute as it was not part of the pleadings before the High Court and had been acquired before the union.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has dismissed an application by the late former president Robert Mugabes secret son, who was seeking to be included as a beneficiary in the longtime rulers estate.\n\nThe alleged son, Tonderayi Gabriel Mugabe, was seeking condonation for the late filing of his review against the estate of the late Robert Gabriel Mugabe.\n\nIn his application, he cited Bona Nyemudzai Ouma Mutsahuni, acting in her capacity as the estates executrix and the Master of the High Court.\n\nBut High Court judge Fatima Maxwell dismissed his application, noting among other things that there was no documentation confirming that he is Mugabes son.\n\nThe inclusion of the fathers details on a birth certificate is proof of acknowledgement of paternity.\n\nThe exclusion, therefore, when the birth certificate was obtained during the lifetime of the alleged father is a clear indication that paternity was not acknowledged, said the judge.\n\nThe judge said re-registration of birth is governed by section 19 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act [Chapter 5:02].\n\nHe saidit can only be conducted where the status of a child is to be changed from being born out of wedlock to born in wedlock.\n\nSection 19 does not allow the re-registration of a birth of a child born out of wedlock whose parents never married and whose father is late.\n\nApplicant did not state that his mother ever married the late former President Robert Gabriel Mugabe.\n\nThat may be the reason why, even though the Births and Deaths Registration office might have bowed to the pressure of the name, they did not go as far as to reflect the details of the alleged father on the birth certificate.\n\nApplicant seems not to have understood the request by the Masters Office in Annexure D to obtain a birth certificate confirming his position.\n\nIt is not simply a matter of having a surname, but of having a birth certificate confirming that the alleged father is indeed the father as claimed.\n\nSuch confirmation would have been if the tendered birth certificate had the details of the father of the child.\n\nNone of the documents confirms who the father of the child is.\n\nWhilst it confirms that the applicant is a sibling of the other person tested, it does not show paternity. What it shows is that he might have been sired by one of the males related to the person who was tested.\n\nFor the above reasons, I find that the applicant has not discharged the onus of proving that he was entitled to benefit from the estate of the Late Robert Gabriel Mugabe.\n\nThere is no reason to allow the reopening of Estate Late Robert Gabriel Mugabe DR 2703/19. No basis has been laid to justify reviewing the Masters decision to confirm the account and close the estate, ruled the judge.\n\nMugabe asserted that he was the son of the former President Robert Gabriel Mugabe, having been born in Mozambique in 1977.\n\nHe presented a narrative of secretive family ties and a quest for identity within the Mugabe lineage.\n\nMugabe said he was born on 20 April 1977 in Chimoio, Mozambique to one Hilda Maeka, having been fathered by the late former president.\n\nHe said his parents met in Zimbabwe after independence, and for reasons unknown to him, his father did not want it to be disclosed to the public that he was his son until a later stage.\n\nHis mother died before the disclosure.\n\nMugabe also alleged that he would meet his father occasionally, but that was kept a secret from the first family.\n\nHe was, however, in contact with his fathers siblings, such as Bridget Mugabe, read court papers.\n\nMugabe further alleged that his father passed away before he was formally introduced to the Mugabe family.\n\nThe estate was advertised, and he notified the executor, Bona Mugabe, about his claim and the fact that he was the deceaseds son.\n\nAccording to court documents, Bonas lawyers requested a DNA Test.\n\nThe DNA tests confirmed that he was born of the Mugabe parental lineage.\n\nThrough a Notarial Deed of Change of Name, he changed his name from Tonderayi Maeka to Tonderayi Gabriel Mugabe.\n\nHe then approached Bona and her lawyers, but was not entertained.\n\nOn the 2nd of June 2023, he then learnt that the estate was closed on 18th of December 2020 by confirmation of the account.\n\nMugabe said he attempted to obtain a declaratory order for the reopening of the Estate of Late Gabriel Mugabe under case number HCH 3729/23 but was not successful.\n\nDespite these claims, the High Court also found the application for condonation lacking in merit, primarily due to his failure to provide a satisfactory explanation for the substantial delay of over four years in pursuing his claims.\n\nThe degree of non-compliance is inordinate, and the explanations given are rife with gaps, ruled the judge, emphasising the need for clear and convincing evidence in matters of inheritance.\n\nThe court deliberated on various factors, including the significance of the alleged heirs delay, which was described as inexplicable by the judge.\n\nWhile the applicant claims a right to the estate, he has not established a reasonable basis for the delay in filing his application, Justice Maxwell articulated, reinforcing the gravity of procedural timelines in legal proceedings.\n\nIn dismissing the application, the court cautioned against potential prejudice to the rightful beneficiaries of the Mugabe estate.\n\nThe balance of convenience favours the dismissal of this application as the deserving beneficiaries of the Estate Late Robert Gabriel Mugabe would be greatly prejudiced by the reversal of a process that was completed more than four years ago, said the judge.\n\n",

Most private farmland remains in the hands of the white minority, while most farm workers are black and poorly paid, fuelling resentment among the black population, while many white farmers complain of high crime rates.\n\nWilliam Musora, 50, another farm worker, is the third accused. He and Mr Olivier, 60, are yet to enter a plea and remain behind bars.\n\nThe three men also face charges of attempted murder for shooting at Ms Ndlovus husband, who was with the women at the farm  as well as possession of an unlicensed firearm and obstructing justice for allegedly dumping the bodies in the pig enclosure in an attempt to conceal evidence.\n\nMr Musora, a Zimbabwean national, faces an additional charge under South Africas Immigration Act over his status as an illegal immigrant.\n\nThe Limpopo High Court was packed with supporters and relatives of the victims ahead of proceedings. Also present was Mr Oliviers wife, who was seated in the front row of the public gallery and could be seen wiping away tears.\n\nMembers of opposition party Economic Freedom Fighters, which has previously called for the farm to be shut down, were also present in the courtroom.\n\nThe trial was postponed to next week.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZANU PF Legal Secretary Patrick Chinamasa has said controversial businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei is now a member of the partys Central Committee and the matter is over and irreversible.\n\nTagwireis co-option into the Central Committee has dragged on, with a faction within the ruling party reportedly opposed to his endorsement into the influential organ.\n\nIn a statement posted on socialmedia, Chinamasa said, The Zanupf Department of Legal Affairs is relieved and takes note that the furore/controversy/confusion/wrangle/much ado about nothing/social media hype/misinformation/disinformation that surrounded Harare Provincial Coordinating Committee (PCC) co-option of Cde Kudakwashe Tagwirei into the Zanu PF Central Committee is now over and irreversibly settled.\n\nFrom the outset, it was difficult to understand the source of the problem. Our Harare PCC convened on Monday, 31 March 2025, and voted to recommend the cooption of Cde Tagwirei into the Central Committee.\n\nThe Province addressed the letter of recommendation to the Zanupf Secretary General, Cde Dr. Obert Moses Mpofu. The letter was copied to the Departments of the Commissariat and Legal Affairs, amongst others.\n\nThe confirmation by Chinamsa is in contradiction with the ZANU PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwasremarks earlier this month that Tagwireis bribe would not work in the party.\n\nTagwireis admission into this elite structure is being widely interpreted as part of a long-term strategy to position him for a future presidential bid, setting him on a collision course with other factions, particularly those aligned with Vice President Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nThe ZANU PF benefactor has been viewed as exploiting his proximity to President Emmerson Mnangagwa to push his leadership agenda.\n\nChinamasa acknowledged that the co-option of Tagwirei has been divisive in the ruling party.\n\nSo the controversy surrounding Cde Tagwireis co-option into the Central Committee surprises me and took me completely off guard. Given Cde Tagwireis commitment to Zanupf and his track record in the service of the Party, the somewhat negative publicity and narrative surrounding his co-option into the Central Committee is undeserved.\n\nI have been a member of the Zanupf Central Committee continuously and without break since December 1987, and a member of the Zanupf Politburo since the year 2000 to date, and I can state unequivocally that throughout this long period of nearly 38 years as Central Committee or as Politburo, we have never had to debate, let alone discuss, PCC recommendations of cooptions into the Central Committee. We always treated such recommendations as fait accompli.\n\nThe cooption of Cde Tagwirei is the first ever to be the subject of discussion and social media commentaries. The only explanation why the Tagwirei cooption has attracted such controversy may be because there are people out there who, for reasons best known to themselves, have an axe to grind, said Chinamasa.\n\n",
