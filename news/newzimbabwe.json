            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nWHILE the government has faced backlash over the ban on the importation and sale of second-hand clothing in cities, Harare Mayor Jacob Mafume has backed the move, saying the capital cannot be turned into a city of bales.\n\nThe Minister of Local Government and Public Works, Daniel Garwe, earlier this week reaffirmed a ban on second-hand clothes, known asbhero,alongside night vending.\n\nSpeaking during a full council session on Thursday, Mafume stated that Harare cannot be sustained by second-hand clothes.\n\nIt is a serious dichotomy. We can not have a society that aspires to wear second-hand clothes. It is a serious oxymoron; we have cotton we can not make new clothes. So we wait for the cotton to be exported and clothes to be manufactured, and they are worn before we wear them.\n\nOn the other hand, we have some in our midst wearing second-hand clothes. We must assist each other as a society. We need to deal with it in a sensitive manner, but at the same time, we can not sustain a city based on second-hand clothes.\n\nDespite their importation ban by the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA), second-hand clothes have provided relief for cash-strapped individuals due to their affordability.\n\nThe ban on the importation of second-hand clothes was implemented by ZIMRA in 2015, but due to porous borders, they continue to flood the streets, being sold at cheaper prices.\n\nIn Harare, second-hand clothes are also sold at night, a practice the government is also banning.\n\nThe Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) has since condemned the move as autocratic, particularly in an economy reliant on the informal sector.\n\nThe Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) notes with deep concern the position taken by the Ministry of Local Government on banning the selling of second-hand clothing and street vending\n\nThis intervention by the Ministry of Local Government is a clear reflection of the failure of the implementation of devolution within the local authority, the decision was made from an autocratic position\n\nThe City of Harare has to run the operations within the City in accordance with Section 264 of the Constitution, the procedure should be done in accordance with the Constitution.\n\nThe informal sector has for years been complementing the formal sector as there has been an emergence of formal businesses operating 24/7 in the CBD over the years, reads the statement by CHRA.\n\n",

She never visited any either alone or with any other person as alleged or at all.\n\nShe did not cast any spell on anyone as alleged or at all, read her defence outline.\n\nThe lawyer said his client will tell the court that the charges are a malicious fabrication of a vindictive former maid who is manipulating the current bad blood between the accused and the complainant.\n\nThe former maid had been relieved of her duties and is bitter about it.\n\nMhandu also said Butau filed the current report as a social media blitz against her and for the purpose of countering a report she made against her at Highlands Police Station on 4 August 2025 under RRB Number 6440490.\n\nShe will also state that the allegations against her do not amount to any practice associated with witchcraft.\n\nFurther, the allegations are vague and embarrassing. They are only meant as a public show for the purposes of causing embarrassment and humiliation of the accused, said the lawyer, praying that the court returns a verdict of not guilty and acquits her of any wrongdoing.\n\n",

In a Tuesday announcement, Meta said it was also rolling new tools on WhatsApp to help people spot scams  including a new safety overview that the platform will show when someone who is not in a users contacts adds them to a group, as well as ongoing test alerts to pause before responding.\n\nScams arebecoming all too commonand increasingly sophisticated in todays digital world  withtoo-good-to-be-trueoffers and unsolicited messages attempting to steal consumers information or money filling our phones, social media and other corners of the internet each day. Meta noted that some of the most prolific sources of scams are criminal scam centers, which oftenspan from forced laboroperated by organized crime  and warned that such efforts often target people on many platforms at once, in attempts to evade detection.\n\nThat means that a scam campaign may start with messages over text or a dating app, for example, and then move to social media and payment platforms, the California-based company said.\n\npointed to recent scam efforts that it said attempted to use its own apps  as well as TikTok, Telegram and AI-generated messages made using ChatGPT  to offer payments for fake likes, enlist people into a pyramid scheme and/or lure others into cryptocurrency investments. Meta linked these scams to a criminal scam center in Cambodia  and said it disrupted the campaign in partnership with ChatGPT makerOpenAI.\n\n",
