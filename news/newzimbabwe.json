            "content": "Aleem Maqbool l BBC Religion Editor\n\nA LONDON-born boy has become the first millennial saint, in a ceremony steeped in an ancient ritual presided over by Pope Leo on Sunday.\n\nIn his short life, Carlo Acutis created websites documenting miracles as a means of spreading Catholic teaching, leading some to nickname him Gods influencer.His canonisation had been due in late April, but was postponed following the death of Pope Francis.More than a million people are estimated to have made a pilgrimage to the Italian hilltop town of Assisi where Carlos body lies, preserved in wax.But there is another pilgrimage site associated with Carlo Acutis that has seen an increase in visitors since it was announced that he was to be made a saint  Our Lady of Dolours Church in London.The font at the back of the Roman Catholic church in the Chelsea area was where Carlo was baptised as a baby in 1991.To the side of the church an old confession booth has been converted into a shrine to him. In it, a relic holder contains a single strand of Carlos hair.His family were in finance and they were working really temporarily in London, says Father Paul Addison, a friar at the church.Although they didnt use the church much, they decided to come and ask to have the child baptised. So Carlo was a flash, a very big flash, in the life of the parish community, he says.Carlo was not yet six months old when his parents moved back to their home country of Italy, and he spent the rest of his life in Milan.There, he was known for a love of technology and is said to have enjoyed playing video games.While some who knew Carlo Acutis say he did not appear to be especially devout, as a teenager he did create a website  pages of which are now framed at the church in Chelsea  in which miracles were documented.Pages of Carlos website are now framed at Our Lady of Dolours Church in ChelseaBut he died of leukaemia aged just 15.In the years after his death, Carlos mother, Antonia Salzano, visited churches around the world to advocate for him to be a saint.As part of the process, it had to be proved her son had performed miracles.The first miracle, he did the day of the funeral, says Carlos mother.A woman with breast cancer prayed (for) Carlo and she had to start chemotherapy and the cancer disappeared completely, she explains.Pope Francis attributed two miracles to Carlo Acutis and so the test was passed and he was due to be made a saint on 27 April.But Pope Francis died during the preceding week.Some followers who had travelled to Rome for the canonisation instead found themselves among the tens of thousands of mourners at the late pontiffs funeral  Diego Sarkissian, a young Catholic from London, was one of them.He says he feels a connection to Carlo Acutis and is excited by his canonisation.He used to play Super Mario video games on the old Nintendo consoles and Ive always loved video games, Mr Sarkissian says.The fact that you can think of a saint doing the same things [as you], wearing jeans, it feels so much closer than what other saints have felt like in the past, he says.Approval for someone to become a saint can take decades or even centuries, but there is a sense that the Vatican fast-tracked Carlo Acutis canonisation as a means of energising and inspiring faith in young people.\n\nIn his short life, Carlo Acutis created websites documenting miracles as a means of spreading Catholic teaching, leading some to nickname him Gods influencer.\n\nHis canonisation had been due in late April, but was postponed following the death of Pope Francis.More than a million people are estimated to have made a pilgrimage to the Italian hilltop town of Assisi where Carlos body lies, preserved in wax.But there is another pilgrimage site associated with Carlo Acutis that has seen an increase in visitors since it was announced that he was to be made a saint  Our Lady of Dolours Church in London.The font at the back of the Roman Catholic church in the Chelsea area was where Carlo was baptised as a baby in 1991.To the side of the church an old confession booth has been converted into a shrine to him.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nIN a grotesque tribute yesterday, President Emmerson Mnangagwa paid a solemn tribute to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the passing of former president Robert Mugabe, whom he ousted through a military-assisted operation in 2017.\n\nMugabe, Zimbabwes founding post-independence leader, died in Singapore on September 6, 2019, two years following his removal from office by Mnangagwa and his Lacoste faction, which fought a bitter succession battle against the Generation 40 faction fronted by wife Grace Mugabe, Saviour Kasukuwere, Walter Mzembi, Jonathan Moyo and Patrick Zhuwawo.In his commemorative message, Mnangagwa praised Mugabe as a freedom fighter par excellence, a veteran nationalist, and revered frontline Statesman.Today, the 6th September, 2025, His Excellency the President E.D. Mnangagwa, the Party and Government join the former First Family and the entire nation in commemorating the passing on of the late First Executive President of Zimbabwe, Cde Robert Gabriel Mugabe, said Mnangagwa.A freedom fighter par excellence, and veteran nationalist, the late Cde R.G. Mugabe, was a revered Frontline Statesman who fearlessly championed the political and economic emancipation of Southern Africa and continent of Africa.Born on February 21, 1924, Mugabe endured 11 years imprisonment at the hands of the settler colonial regime before emerging in 1975 to lead Zanu in a protracted war of independence from bases in Mozambique.Mugabe prosecuted the armed struggle, known as the Second Chimurenga/Umvukela, culminated in Zimbabwes independence in 1980.Mnangagwa described Mugabe as a true son of the soil and iconic liberation fighter, whose political astuteness shaped the First Republic.Among his landmark legacies, the Land Reform Programme redefined land ownership patterns, addressing historic injustices of colonial dispossession.His indigenisation and economic empowerment policies sought to restore dignity, self-belief, and resilience to Zimbabweans, even in the face of illegal sanctions, the 82-year-old Zanu PF leader said.Himself a beneficiary of Mugabes benevolence, Mnangagwa added that in the social sphere, Mugabe broadened access to education and healthcare for the once marginalised majority blacks.In recognition of this, Mnangagwa said, the Second Republic established a National Honours and Awards category in his name, dedicated to human capital development.Mnangagwa equated Mugabe to fallen continental giants such as Julius Nyerere, Jomo Kenyatta, Kenneth Kaunda, Samora Machel, Agostino Neto, Sam Nujoma, Joshua Nkomo, and Nelson Mandela.He was a fervent Pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to fighting apartheid, promoting African renaissance, and advancing the cause of the downtrodden across the world, Mnangagwa said.As we remember our late President, the Second Republic once again re-dedicates itself to preserving the legacy of Cde R.G. Mugabe by winding up the successful National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) and preparing NDS2 guided by the goal to have a society that is free, democratic and prosperous, which leaves no-one and no place behind through inclusive development, he added.Mnangagwa noted that his Zanu PF party and government commit to iconic Mugabes enduring mantra that Zimbabwe will never be a colony again.\n\nMugabe, Zimbabwes founding post-independence leader, died in Singapore on September 6, 2019, two years following his removal from office by Mnangagwa and his Lacoste faction, which fought a bitter succession battle against the Generation 40 faction fronted by wife Grace Mugabe, Saviour Kasukuwere, Walter Mzembi, Jonathan Moyo and Patrick Zhuwawo.\n\nIn his commemorative message, Mnangagwa praised Mugabe as a freedom fighter par excellence, a veteran nationalist, and revered frontline Statesman.Today, the 6th September, 2025, His Excellency the President E.D.

He charged at you and you felt threatened. Your use of a log was, however, disproportionate You were therefore negligent.The court heard that Khumalo is a first offender, left school at Grade 7 due to poverty, and now looks after his sick mother and his late brothers daughter.
