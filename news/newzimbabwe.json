But on arriving, the CWUZ receptionist hurriedly accompanied me to the boardroom where I was shocked to meet a lady, who swiftly greeted me and introduced herself.\n\nHow are you? I am the CWUZ president. Please kindly take a seat, she said without wasting much time.\n\nBut who really is this woman of steel who has managed to fit in the shoes left behind by some iconic unionists like Lucia Matibenga, whose spine spurred her to greater political offices at national level?\n\nMy name is Josephine Makuwa. I am based in the Midlands provinces Kwekwe city. I am employed by OK Zimbabwe as a till controller. My journey to the top was largely inspired by the desire to stand up for other peoples rights, she said.\n\nThe CWUZ president said she is self-driven for greater heights. Hers was a long and arduous journey which began right from the grassroots as an ordinary committee member in a branch structure.\n\nI have an insatiable appetite to achieve and above all, I believe in my abilities. I also pursue opportunities for education, training and leadership development. Over and above these qualities, I invest in building connections with other women and allies who share similar goals and values with me, she said.\n\nMakuwa said during her tenure she is determined to tackle problems affecting workers in the retail sector, which includes gender-based violence (GBV), socio-cultural barriers, discriminatory laws and policies working to the disadvantage of employees.\n\nShe said she will deploy her term of office towards transforming CWUZ to build capacity which enables it to represent and advocate for members interests by empowering workers through education and training, engaging with government and employers to influence policies that benefit workers and promote economic growth and to partner with other organisations to amplify the unions impact and promote workers interests.\n\nl will make sure that there is a huge expansion in membership drive through organising and recruitment of new members to increase bargaining power and influence.\n\nCWUZ should achieve an improvement in the current working conditions by the continued negotiating for better wages and benefits through collective bargaining agreements, internal structures, governance and financial management will be strengthened to ensure long term sustainability, she said.\n\nThe CWUZ leader urged members to stay engaged and participate in the unions activities for their voices to be heard.\n\n",
