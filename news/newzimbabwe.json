            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nSOUTHERN African Development Community (SADC) member states continue to register commendable progress in implementing the SADC Free Trade Area (FTA) and regional programmes.\n\nSADC Senior Officials chairperson Ambassador Albert Chimbindi said this Monday as the 34th meeting of the Committee of SADC Ministers of Trade (CMT) and 24th Ministerial Task Force on Regional Integration (MTF) kicked off in Harare.\n\nChimbindi told regional delegates that it is heartening to note that despite the prolonged hiatus since the last CMT meeting in July, 2023 member states have continued to register commendable progress in implementing the SADC Free Trade Area (FTA) and related regional programmes.\n\nThis demonstrates our unwavering resolve to advance the SADC regional integration agenda, even amid global economic turbulence.\n\nHe, however, challenged member states to equally acknowledge that several decisions from previous CMT meetings remain outstanding and unimplemented due to various challenges, including the prolonged hiatus that the regional bloc witnessed.\n\nI, therefore, call upon all member states and the Secretariat to redouble efforts toward the full and timely implementation of all the pending decisions.\n\nOnly through coordinated action and a sense of urgency can we deliver on our shared aspirations. Intra SADC trade, participation at these trying times globally, should be at the centre of what we do. Trade is so key to regional developments and industrialisation that we should never again allow ourselves to fail to meet, Chimbindi said.\n\nThe meeting is taking place against a background of profound global economic disruptions, marked by increasing protectionism, shifting trade alliances, and unpredictable supply chains.\n\nAdded Chimbindi, In this complex and zero-sum trading environment, adaptation is not optional; it is imperative. We must collectively understand the changing dynamics, anticipate future dynamics and disruptions and adopt responsive policies if we are to remain relevant players in the global economy.\n\nCollectiveaction is key.\n\nAccording to the Ambassador, there has been a growing convergence of views within the region on the need to build greater resilience and deepen intra-regional trade, which must be matched by action.\n\nWe, the member states, hold the key to translating intent into tangible outcomes. Our people expect nothing less from us.\n\nIt is encouraging that our agenda today prioritises critical trade facilitation issues. These are essential levers for improving regional trade cooperation, eliminating all forms of barriers and unlocking the full potential of our industrialisation agenda.\n\nSimplifying trade procedures, harmonising standards, and investing in digital and physical infrastructure will not only boost trade flows but also stimulate innovation and sustainable growth.\n\nHe warned members that they should deliberate, being aware of the far-reaching implications the decisions for the SADC trading ecosystem in the context of an ever-evolving global landscape.\n\nThe Senior Officials Meeting of the 34th SADC Committee of Ministers of Trade (CMT) is a precursor to the CMT session scheduled to be held this Thursday, June 5, 2025, convening in Mount Hampden, New Parliament Building.\n\nThe meeting marks a critical juncture in our collective efforts to deepen regional integration, enhance trade facilitation, and drive industrial development across the SADC region.\n\n",

On a year-on-year basis, the deficit increased from US$185.9 million in March 2024 to US$228.0 million in the reporting month, the RBZ said.\n\nDuring the period, merchandise imports amounted to US$809.9 million in March 2025, reflecting a 10.9% increase from US$730.4 million recorded in the previous month. On a year-on-year basis, imports rose by 12.4%.\n\nDuring the month under review, most of the countrys imports originated from South Africa (38.2%), China (15.2%), the Bahamas (11.5%), and Mozambique (4.9%), with the rest sourced from a range of other markets.\n\nThe countrys export basket was predominantly composed of primary commodities, with gold leading at 42.4%, followed by PGMs, (16.0%), tobacco (17.1%), and other mineral exports (6.7%).\n\nIn March 2025, the countrys exports were mainly destined for the United Arab Emirates (40.7%), South Africa (24.4%), and China at 20.8%. The remaining exports were spread across various other international markets, said the RBZ.\n\nMarket watchers are of the view that Zimbabweurgently needs to adopt a radical policy shift to spur local industrial productivity to plug the huge foreign currency outflows.\n\n",

            "content": "By Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThis story was originally published byGlobal Press Journal.\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  Its possible to buy pretty much anything at the market in Hopley, an informal settlement south of this capital city: rat poison, mops  even medicine.\n\nThat medicine is sold without prescriptions, to buyers who dont have a diagnosis from a doctor in hand. Some vendors even offer diagnoses to their customers, even though they dont have any medical training. And in many cases, the medicine is fake. At any moment, police could swoop in for a raid. Vendors keep the medicine out of view, and buyers know who to ask.\n\nGladys Chihozhwa buys contraceptive pills from one of them, and even turns to the vendors for diagnoses when shes sick. She knows the drugs might be expired, or even fake. That doesnt deter her. I buy them because they are cheap, she says.\n\nZimbabwe is overwhelmed with counterfeit medicine, driven by the expansion of informal markets and consumer demand for cheaper products. Police routinely impound pharmaceuticals. In just one example, the Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe in January discovered counterfeit rabies vaccines in circulation. Their packaging mimicked that of legitimate imports from India, a big supplier of Zimbabwes medicine.\n\nThe vaccines pathway into the market remains unclear, but some products pour into Zimbabwes informal markets through its leaky borders with Zambia, where counterfeit medicines from India are easily available, and cheap.\n\nThe consequences of this trade can be fatal. According to a2022 report by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, in sub-Saharan Africa alone, counterfeit medicines kill just over a quarter of a million people each year.\n\nEven when not immediately fatal, they can cause long-term harm, includingincreasing antibiotic resistance, says Dr. Grant Marewanhema, a public health expert.\n\nIn a written response, public relations officer Davison Kaiyo says the Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe has tried to address this problem by conducting raids with the police and intercepting counterfeit medicines at borders. They also conduct regular inspections at pharmacies. Those caught are prosecuted, and the medicines confiscated, he says.\n\nBut demand is high, so new shipments keep pouring in.\n\nDistribution of fake and substandard medicines is a global, highly profitable criminal enterprise. One 2020study by the Pacific Research Instituteestimated that the counterfeit medicine market is worth somewhere between US$200 billion and US$431 billion annually.\n\nMany of the counterfeit drugs are produced in India, where a mix of highly reputable drug manufacturers and unregulated producers creates serious challenges for oversight and quality control.\n\nAfrica is particularly affected. According to the World Health Organization, 42% of globally detected cases of counterfeit and substandard medical products between 2013 and 2017 were in Africa.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, porous borders facilitate the movement, but a combination of other factors fuels the trade. The countrys decades-long economic problems have left thehealth care system hanging by a thread. Many public hospitals simply dont have medicine supply, says Portifa Mwendera, a pharmacist of 25 years. Most times, patients are given prescriptions and told to source the medication elsewhere, he says.\n\nBut Zimbabwe produces only 30% of its essential medicines. The rest is imported and costly in pharmacies. Many people in the country are too strapped for cash, and these vendors offer options that are easier on the pocket, Mwendera says.\n\nSanudi, a cross-border truck driver, has for two decades smuggled medicine into the country through the Chirundu border post, a key trade and travel point between Zambia and Zimbabwe. He knows many other truckers who do the same. Sanudi asked Global Press Journal to use his middle name for fear of arrest.\n\nIts easy, he says. At the border, if the bag is small, he leaves it with a security guard as the truck undergoes scanning. He pays the guard US$50 to US$60, then charges the traders about US$200 to transport two small bags. If the consignment is too big to stash with the guards, he simply bribes the officials scanning the trucks.\n\nIts a risky operation, but I do it for the extra money I get, he says.\n\nGlobal Press Journal reached out to officials at the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority, but they did not respond to interview requests.\n\nGozo, a vendor who also asked Global Press Journal to use only one name for fear of arrest, sells pharmaceuticals without a license, and offers diagnoses. Once the customer describes their symptoms, Gozo says she knows what to sell them. Two years in this trade have sufficiently equipped her, she says, especially in prescribing antibiotics.\n\nThe people I sell the drugs to get better, she says.\n\nAntibiotics such as ciprofloxacin are popular at her stall, and many of them come from a supplier who gets them from Zambia. Ten antibiotics pills go for US$1 at her stall. In licensed pharmacies, the cost can be twice as much.\n\nIf arrested, she could face high fines or even imprisonment. Police conduct raids at the market from time to time, but sellers like her depend on this trade for a living.\n\nI always take the risk, she says.\n\nGamuchirai Masiyiwais a Global Press Journal reporter-in-residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.\n\n",

Such conditions are known to severely affect canine behaviour and are especially dangerous when present in certain breeds, particularly those already classified as high risk or dangerous, the SPCA said.\n\nThe SPCA further warned the public against crossbreeding dangerous dog breeds, explaining that such animals require specialised handling skills that many owners may lack, potentially leading to tragic outcomes.\n\nWe strongly caution the public against the ownership, breeding, and cross-breeding of dangerous dog breeds. These animals require specialised handling, socialization and containment responsibilities that, if neglected, can result in tragic consequences such as these, the SPCA added.\n\nThe organisation urgedthe public to approach its offices for assistance with appropriate animal care, advice, or if they wish to surrender their animals.\n\n",
