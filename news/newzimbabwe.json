            "content": "NZ Herald\n\nFormer Zimbabwe cricket captain Brendan Taylor is set to face the Black Caps just days after his three-and-a-half-year ban from cricket is lifted, according to reports.\n\nTaylor was handed the ban in 2022 for breaching the ICCs anti-corruption code after he admitted to taking money from match-fixers in India  but claimed he never fixed or manipulated games.\n\nHis ban officially expires on Saturday, after which he will be named in the Zimbabwe test squad to face the Black Caps, with the first test beginning on July 30, Cricinfo reports.\n\nThe 39-year-old has previously played 34 tests including leading Zimbabwe to a close defeat to the Black Caps in 2011, in which he scored a century in the fourth innings before the home side fell 34 runs short of victory.\n\nTaylor admitted he took money from match-fixers who tried to blackmail him into manipulating international games with a secret video of him using cocaine on a visit to India in 2019.\n\nEven though he took US$15,000 ($25,000) from the fixers, Taylor said he never fixed or manipulated games.\n\nTaylor said he was invited to India to discuss a sponsorship opportunity in October 2019. At a dinner with businessmen, he was offered cocaine and foolishly took the bait.\n\nThe following morning, the same men entered my hotel room to show me a video taken of me the night before doing cocaine and told me that if I did not partake in spot fixing at international matches, the video would be released to the public, Taylor said.\n\nTaylor said he took the US$15,000 from the men, who said it was now a deposit for him to fix and they promised him another US$20,000 ($33,500) once the fixing job was complete.\n\nTaylor took four months to report the incident to the ICC and accepted that was against crickets anti-corruption rules.\n\nThe Black Caps and Zimbabwe will play a two-test series with both matches taking place in Bulawayo.\n\nZimbabwe have already named a 16-man squad which includes four changes following a 2-0 series defeat to South Africa last month, with Ben Curran, Sikandar Raza, Roy Kaia and Tanunurwa Makoni joining the side. Cricinfo reports Taylor is expected to be added to the squad.\n\nTaylor told Cricinfo in March that he has been using facilities at an elite independent school in Harare, preparing for his return.\n\nI still want to play and I believe I could make an impact as a player, he said.\n\nI look at where Im at physically and mentally and if I didnt feel I could do it, I wouldnt bother. Givemore [Makoni, managing director of Zimbabwe Cricket] has really supported me on this. He sort of shut down the coaching role for now and said, Can you play and try to push yourself up until the 2027 World Cup? Granted Ill be 41 then but with sobriety, Im living my truest form.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA Harare pastor has been spared from serving a 20-year jail term after the High Court quashed his conviction and sentence, having found that the lower court erred in finding him guilty.\n\nJeane Pierre Dusabe was jailed by a Harare magistrate for allegedly raping and indecently assaulting a minor girl he took custody of after her parents divorced back in 2014.\n\nThe rape only emerged ten years later, when the girl got married, with a formal report being made later in 2023.\n\nThe court heard, Dusabe was aged 39 while the girl was aged 12 years when the offence was allegedly committed.\n\nThe allegations in count one were that the appellant indecently assaulted the complainant once at a house in Harare.\n\nOn the second count, it was alleged that on dates unknown to the prosecutor between the years 2014 and 2022 and at different places in Harare and Masvingo, the appellant hadsexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent on several occasions.\n\nDusabe was charged with one count of rape and another of indecent assault.\n\nThe complainantstestimony was that sometime in 2014 Dusabe touched her private parts when her aunt was away on a trip to South Africa.\n\nShe was having swimming lessons conducted by Dusabe in a pool at her home in Mandara, together with her sister, who was also a minor.\n\nOn the same day, around midnight, the appellant came into the room, got into the blankets, and got on top of her.\n\nShe awoke to find the appellant on top of her before he raped her while covering her mouth.\n\nShe said after this incident, the appellant had sexual intercourse with her without her consent several times at different homes they stayed in.\n\nShe also said sometime in 2015 on unknown dates and in Hateld, the appellant would occasionally transport her to and from school using his commuter omnibus. It is alleged that during these times, the appellant would take advantage of the complainant and have sexual intercourse with her without her consent at a bushy area in Arlington.\n\nThe complainant also told the court a quo that sometime in March 2022, on an unknown date, she fell sick and sought the appellants help.\n\nShe said Dusabe suggested to her that they go to Masvingo to a doctor whom he knew who could treat her.\n\nWhilst there, Dusabe had sexual intercourse with her four times without her consent, after his relatives, whom they had found at his house, had left for Harare.\n\nThe alleged rape only surfaced after her husband confronted her over her virginity when they got married.\n\nShe told her that Dusabe had raped her several times.\n\nThe husband then told church members in 2022 but a formal report was made two years later.\n\nThe trial court found Dusabe guilty of rape and indecent assault before sentencing him to 20 years imprisonment.\n\nAggrieved, he mounted the present application, complaining that the lower court erred in convicting him when there was no evidence linking him to the alleged crimes.\n\nDusabe proved that his wife never visited South Africa in 2014 by producing her passport.\n\nThree relatives testified that Dusabe never resided at a house with a functional swimming pool.\n\nHis lawyer said the lower court was wrong in finding that the delay in reporting the rape was reasonable when one considers the manner in which the offence surfaced and material discrepancies in the evidence of the complainant.\n\nHe also said the alleged rape in Masvingo took place when the complainant was already married and that she failed to disclose it, then was therefore unreasonable.\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Christopher Dube Banda upheld Dusabes appeal, ruling that the report of rape does not meet the requirements for admissibility.\n\nThe trial court erred in failing to make findings on material aspects of the case.\n\nThe delay in reporting the alleged rape and indecent assault and the circumstances under which the disclosure was made render the complaint doubtful and unreasonable.\n\nConsequently, the State evidence led is not reliable and safe to convict on.\n\nThe appellants story is convincing.\n\nThe State failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe evidence that was placed before the court did not meet the required threshold when regard is had to the evidence of the State witnesses.\n\nOn that basis, this court is obliged to interfere with the findings of the trial court.\n\nThe evidence being unreliable, it was unsafe to convict the appellant on its basis.\n\nAccordingly, the court finds that the States concession was properly made. The appeal succeeds. As a result, it is ordered that the appeal against both conviction and sentence is upheld.\n\nThe court a quos conviction and sentence be and is hereby set aside and in its place is substituted the following; The accused is found not guilty and acquitted, the judge ruled.\n\n",
