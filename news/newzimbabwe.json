            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo l IOL\n\nPOLICE in Limpopo searched a Toyota Fortuner driven by a Zimbabwean national on the N1 freeway and found R446,000 in a bag, which was then seized by the law enforcement authorities.\n\nThe High Court in Limpopo has granted a forfeiture order for a cash amount of R446,000 and a Toyota Fortuner sport utility vehicle, which were seized by police.\n\nThe Hawks asset forfeiture investigation unit and the National Prosecuting Authoritys asset forfeiture unit (AFU) worked tirelessly to ensure the forfeiture of the money and the vehicle.\n\nThis emanates from the arrest conducted by members of the South African Police Service attached to Musina in 2024. On 4 July 2024, police conducted a stop and search operation along the N1 road in Musina, said Warrant Officer Lethunya Mmuroa, provincial spokesperson for the Hawks in Limpopo.\n\nDuring the operation, the police officers stopped the Toyota Fortuner which was driven by a foreign national.\n\nDuring a search, police found a plastic bag that contained South African bank notes underneath blankets inside the boot. Police interviewed the driver, and he failed to give a clear explanation for carrying the large amount of money inside the vehicle, said Mmuroa.\n\nThe driver was immediately arrested and the money was seized.\n\nThe Hawks asset forfeiture investigation unit was consulted for asset investigation.\n\nAfter completion of the investigations, the Hawks referred the matter to the National Prosecuting Authoritys asset forfeiture unit for further handling.\n\nFollowing court processes, the High Court in Limpopo granted a preservation order for the Toyota Fortuner and the money in February, before the forfeiture order was granted last week.\n\nThe cash was deposited into the criminal asset recovery account on 29 July. The forfeited Toyota Fortuner is about to be sold on auction, said Mmuroa.\n\nEarlier this year, IOL reported that a 49-year-old man was arrested on charges of money laundering after being found in possession of about R1.2 million in cash.\n\nAt the time, provincial police spokesperson in Mpumalanga, Lieutenant Colonel Jabu Ndubane, said the arrested man had allegedly tried to bribe police officers after the money was found.\n\nThis achievement is the result of the dedication by members deployed for Operation Vala Umgodi, and the man was nabbed on 16 March 2025 at Tonga near Komatipoort, said Ndubane.\n\nShe said police officers received a tip-off about a man who was allegedly in possession of an unlicenced firearm.\n\nThey then responded swiftly and followed the information, and upon arrival at Tonga View, they found the owner of the house and conducted a search and it was during that time when they discovered the large sum of money hidden under the bed as well as inside the wardrobe, said Ndubane.\n\nThe astute members continued searching in other rooms where they further found a bag full of money. It was during the process when the man tried his luck to bribe the police officials with R50,000, but his attempts failed dismally.\n\nNdubane said the money amounted to R1.2 million in banknotes and coins, while there was also Mozambican currency.\n\n",

In the affidavit, he identified himself as a Zimbabwean man living in Centurion, possessing a Zimbabwean passport with an unverified number.\n\nAccording to the supporting affidavit, Ezihes spousal application had been pending for two years without a response or decision from Home Affairs.\n\nIn June 2025, he served a notice of motion on home affairs and the director general of home affairs.\n\nEzihe asked the court to direct home affairs officials to issue a decision on the outcome of his application within 30 days.\n\nIn May 2025, Bandas affidavit, which claimed to be from Ezihe, was deposed and commissioned to support the notice of motion.\n\nLater, Ezihes supplementary affidavit, which supports Bandas affidavit, was deposed and commissioned in June 2025. This occurred without the prior leave of the court.\n\nEzihes legal representative argued that there were no legal provisions requiring the parties to obtain leave before supplementing their court submissions.\n\nHowever, Judge Keitumetse Johanna Mogale said the decision to permit the filing of an additional affidavit remains within the courts discretion.\n\nJudge Mogale said if affidavits are filed without leave from the court, the affidavits can be ignored.\n\nI conclude that supplementing court papers without prior leave from the court is not allowed. Disregarding rules governing the filing of affidavits can result in the affidavit being struck from the record or the court refusing to consider it, she said.\n\nFurthermore, the judge was not impressed with the application and said it was drafted as a cut-and-paste from a template.\n\nShe further criticised Ezihes legal representative for failing to comply with procedural standards.\n\nMs. Hadebe bears the duty to uphold professional integrity in her dealings with the client, the court, and in all professional interactions, said judge Mogale.\n\nTherefore, it is my view that the applicant (Ezihe) has failed to make out a proper case for an order compelling the respondents (home affairs officials) to issue the outcome of the applicants spousal permit application, she said.\n\nEzihes application was dismissed.\n\n",

            "content": "By Dr Richard Dune\n\nAs the UK deploys AI to detect healthcare risks in real time, what lessons can be drawn for regulatory compliance and governance worldwide?\n\nOn 30 June 2025, the UK government announced the launch of a world-first AI early warning system for the National Health Service (NHS). The initiative, part of its 10-Year Health Plan, aims to transform patient safety and regulatory inspections by using real-time data to detect early signs of harm, before tragedy occurs.\n\nThis system will empower the Care Quality Commission (CQC), Englands independent health and social care regulator, to carry out rapid response inspections whenever AI algorithms detect anomalies in care, such as a spike in stillbirths, preventable deaths, or critical incidents.\n\nIn the context of mounting regulatory failures in recent years, particularly within NHS maternity and mental health services, this bold shift towards predictive oversight and digital compliance could not be more timely.\n\nBut will it work? And what can healthcare systems in Zimbabwe, across Africa, and in the diaspora learn from this transformative approach?\n\nFrom Mid Staffordshire, where up to 1,200 patients died due to neglect, to the Lucy Letby case, in which a neonatal nurse was convicted of murdering seven babies, failures in the NHS have highlighted one painful truth: the system doesnt catch harm soon enough.\n\nIn 2023, multiple NHS maternity units were under investigation, with affected families saying they were ignored or gaslit when they raised concerns.\n\nThe Dash Review (2024) revealed the scale of the problem: the average wait time for a reinspection of Inadequate providers had increased from 87 to 136 days, while some with Requires Improvement ratings waited up to a year. Hundreds of inspection reports were lost due to IT failures, leaving vulnerable patients at risk.\n\nThe NHS, with its 1.3 million employees, thousands of hospitals and clinics, and a massive volume of patient interactions, still largely relies on:\n\nThis approach is reactive, not preventive, and ill-equipped to keep pace with modern healthcare risks.\n\nRapid Response Inspections, introduced in recent years, are an improvement, but still depend on someone raising the alarm. What if the system could detect risk from within  automatically and in real-time?\n\nThis is the very problem that digital compliance systems, supervision Learning Management Systems (LMS), and Training Management Systems (TMS) are built to solve.\n\nThe new AI system, developed under the Plan for Change, will:\n\nThe first rollout, the Maternity Outcomes Signal System, will go live in November 2025. It will monitor indicators such as neonatal deaths, neurological injuries, and emergency escalations across NHS trusts.\n\nIf successful, the model will expand to cover wider incidents, making England the first country in the world to integrate AI directly into regulatory inspections.\n\nThe table below outlines how the CQC will now operate under a two-track model.\n\nIn support of this, the CQC will also:\n\nThis is no longer just about inspections. Its about embedding digital surveillance into governance frameworks, a move that will resonate with policymakers worldwide grappling with similar healthcare risks.\n\nThis new AI capability is built on the NHS Federated Data Platform (FDP), which brings together:\n\nThis 360 view of compliance risk means that NHS providers, and their leaders, must now be audit-ready every day, not just every few years.\n\nFor health and social care leaders in Zimbabwe and across Africa, the message is clear:\n\nThese are no longer nice-to-haves. They are essential components of a resilient and transparent compliance ecosystem.\n\nThe NHS has long been accused of failing to act on known risks, a problem dubbed the implementation gap.\n\nFor this new AI system to succeed, it must be backed by:\n\nAs Sir Julian Hartley, CEO of the CQC, stated, this approach requires aclearer, simpler assessment framework, but it also demands systems that help providers improve, not just fear failure.\n\nThe UKs plan also pledges to strengthen Freedom to Speak Up protocols, with CQC checking whether Integrated Care Boards (ICBs) and providers support whistleblowers.\n\nIn a world of machine-learning models and automated alerts, the human voice, especially that of frontline workers and their families, must not be drowned out.\n\nAI should amplify, not replace, human insight.\n\nAt The Mandatory Training Group, we believe in embedding compassionate governance into all digital systems, whether thats through supervision pathways, LMS/TMS compliance dashboards, or workforce wellbeing initiatives.\n\nInnovation is exciting, but innovation without people is meaningless.\n\nAs Professor Nicola Ranger, General Secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, warned:\n\nTechnology has a role, but in todays NHS, one nurse can be caring for 15 patients. Thats drastically unsafe.\n\nDaniel Elkeles, CEO of NHS Providers, echoed this:\n\nTrusts need time and support to improve. Regulation must be collaborative, not combative.\n\nDigital compliance must empower frontline teams, not overwhelm them with automated penalties.\n\nThe NHS AI early warning system presents a template not just for the UK, but for any country looking to modernise healthcare governance.\n\nFor Zimbabwean policymakers and healthcare entrepreneurs, this offers key insights:\n\nWhether youre running a clinic in Bulawayo, managing training systems for diaspora health workers, or building a compliance framework for a public hospital, this model is worth watching.\n\nBehind every scandal is a silent alarm that was missed.\n\nThis AI system promises to change the timeline of regulation, from reactive punishment to proactive prevention. But success depends on more than algorithms.\n\nIt requires:\n\nTo help health and social care providers adapt, Ive led the development ofComplyPlus, an all-in-one regulatory compliance management platform.\n\nDesigned for both UK and international health and social care providers, ComplyPlus supports:\n\nExplore the ComplyPlus suite:\n\nWith AI reshaping regulation, your systems must evolve too.\n\nRELATED:\n\nFor more insights on regulatory reform, AI in healthcare, training systems, and governance tools, follow my weekly columns onNewZimbabwe.comand connect with me on LinkedIn.\n\nDr Richard Dune is the CEO of LearnPac Systems, a leading UK provider of edtech and compliance software solutions for regulated sectors.
