Care workers from overseas have made a huge contribution, but too many have been subject to abuse and exploitation, the UK Home Office announced via its official X account on May 12.Were moving away from our dependence on overseas workers to restore control and fairness to the system.\n\nIndia, Nigeria and Zimbabwe have been the three biggest sources of care workers migrating to the UK since it began offering them such visas. According to UK Home Office data, 15,709 care-worker visas were issued to Zimbabwean nationals in 2023, while Nigerians received 19,449, including dependents.\n\nThe visa cancellation is part of a wider clampdown on immigration under Prime Minister Keir Starmers government, which is facing increasing pressure to reduce migrant numbers amid growing support for anti-immigration parties like Nigel Farages Reform UK, according toBloomberg.\n\nFor many Zimbabweans, the permits had offered a lifeline, an opportunity to escape an economy marked by instability and inflation. Over the years, Zimbabwes currency has been one of the worlds worst performers.\n\nThe countrys latest attempt at monetary stability, thegold-backed ZiG, marks its sixth currency experiment in just 15 years. Despite its promise, the ZiG has yet to gain meaningful traction. In September, the central bank devalued the ZiG by 43% to narrow the gulf between official and black-market exchange rates.\n\nThe migration surge has triggered a significant brain drain in Zimbabwe, depleting the country of skilled professionals, not only in health care but also across critical sectors such as banking, accounting, and information technology, said Memory Nguwi, managing consultant at Industrial Psychology Consultants, a Harare-based HR advisory firm.\n\nZimbabwean authorities have raised concerns that the exodus of nurses and doctors to the UK has created a severe gap in the countrys already fragile healthcare system.\n\n",

Together, we can develop a serious framework for investment, which will ensure productivity growth in this sector and let our economies prosper, he said.\n\nZimbabwe has abundant mineral resources, which have led to a rush by foreign investors, particularly the Chinese, in the lithium sector.\n\nHowever, according to observers, the extraction has not translated into an improvement in the livelihoods of ordinary citizens.\n\nIf Lukashenko heeds Mnangagwas invitation, Belarus will become the latest country to join the mineral rush.\n\nTuesday, a Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) Member of Parliament, Edwin Mushoriwa, raised concerns about the relationship between Zimbabwe and Belarus while debating the bilateral agreement between the two countries on the promotion and reciprocal protection of investments.\n\nWe also need to be worried when we end up having a trade arrangement which can easily be manipulated and exploited by a few well-connected individuals, who end up bringing in certain items.\n\nSome of these deals were done by the Ministry of Local Government and then imposed on local authorities under devolution funds.\n\nWe cannot, as a country, continue to allow ourselves, as Parliament, to endorse this agreement. An agreement cannot be based on political friendship. It cannot be an agreement based on friendship alone, said Mushoriwa.\n\n",

The disputed additional assessments amount to US$74.8 million.\n\nManagement continues to engage with ZIMRA while appealing some legal and factual issues of the assessments and the judgments, with guidance from tax experts and legal counsel. These assessments have a material impact on the Groups operations, if they materialise as per the extant assessments, he said.\n\nMoyo described the ambiguities in the tax legislation as pervasive, thereby creating risks of further disagreements in interpretations and application to current taxes.\n\nMeanwhile, during the period, group revenue for the year at US$807 million increased by 5% compared to the restated prior year figures, reflecting the volume growth in Lager Beer and the sugar tax-induced price increases in sparkling beverages.\n\nThe proportion of domestic sales undertaken in foreign currency was around 80% for most of the year, although there were periodic shifts in response to the performance of the formal retail sector, which was affected by exchange rate disparities and the level of enforcement of the dual pricing regulations.\n\nOperating Income (Earnings before interest and tax) is indicated at US$153 million, which is in line with the prior year. Profit before tax is indicated at US$139.9 million compared to US$104.4 million for the prior year. It is noted that the prior year comparative figures included currency-related distortions.\n\nThe trading margins in the current period were partly affected by the under recovery on the sugar tax and the higher cost of imported maize. It is highlighted that an equivalent of US$20.7 million was paid as sugar tax by Delta Beverages and Schweppes Zimbabwe during the current year.\n\nThe operating environment in Zimbabwe remains complex, influenced by policy changes and currency instability. The beverages sector faces further challenges relating to uncompetitive retail prices arising from high input costs and taxes which attract lower-priced imports from the region and policy-driven changes to the route to market.\n\nWe continue to urge the authorities to implement policies that would ensure the stability of the local currency and access to foreign currency through the banking channels or through trading, added Moyo.\n\n",

These steps are paramount to safeguarding the fundamental rights of all Zimbabweans.\n\nThe ZPP warned that without deliberate action to reverse these disturbing trends, the pursuit of sustainable peace, democracy, and justice remains critically undermined.\n\nThe government, as well as local authorities, have also been implicated as perpetrators of human rights violations.\n\nAccording to the report, Zanu PF committed over thirty-four percent of the total of all human rights violations recorded by the peace watchdog in April 2025.\n\nAnalysis of the data indicates that individuals affiliated with the ruling party, ZANU PF, were responsible for 34.1% of the reported violations, the report stated.\n\nThe ZPP also fingered the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) as one of the main perpetrators of human rights violation, alleging that about six percent of the total rights violations cases were committed by the military.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) accounted for 24.1% of the perpetrators, while local councils were responsible for 15.64%. The Zimbabwe National Army contributed 6.41%, and government officials 4.62%, the report detailed, highlighting the wide net of responsibility for the abuses.\n\nAccording to the report, Masvingo Province recorded the highest number of violations with 20 cases, followed by Harare Province with 14, mirroring the same patterns observed in March 2025.\n\nOther provinces included Manicaland 12, Mashonaland Central 13, Mashonaland East 11, and Mashonaland West 12. The situation remains bleak across much of the country.\n\nMidlands Province reportedly recorded a decrease in reported incidents, from 14 in March to five in April. Bulawayo 1 (one), Matabeleland North 2 (two), and Matabeleland South 3 (three) reported significantly fewer violations.\n\nOn a positive note, ZPP says apart from the worrying human rights violations trend in the country, the High Court ruling last month that justified the University of Zimbabwe (UZ) lecturers industrial strike offered a glimmer of hope.\n\nDespite the worrying trends, the month also brought a positive development in the form of a High Court ruling affirming the constitutional right to strike by the University of Zimbabwes Association of University Teachers (AUT), the report noted, providing a chink of light in what is otherwise a very dark tunnel.\n\n",
