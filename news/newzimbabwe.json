            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has dismissed an application by Abigail Makono seeking to stop the execution of a US$600,000 divorce settlement owed to her ex-husband, Charles Makono, ruling that her challenge was manifestly groundless and an abuse of court process.\n\nJustice Regis Dembure, in the October 16 judgment, ordered Abigail to pay legal costs on a higher practitionerclient scale, warning that the court will not tolerate anyone attempting to evade compliance with its orders.\n\nThe dispute arose after a consent order in April 2025 required Abigail to pay Charles US$600,000 in exchange for properties awarded to her in their divorce settlement. Instead of paying, she sought to have the writ of execution declared invalid, alleging that Charles had failed to sign property transfer documents.\n\nDembure rejected the claim, saying, A party that has failed to fulfil its own obligations in terms of the consent order cannot seek to enforce the obligations of the other party.\n\nThe court found that Charles had already complied by signing and delivering the necessary documents.\n\nAbigails lawyer, Chivhenge, later abandoned some arguments, conceding that claims about improper mixing of movable and immovable property were untenable.\n\nThere should be no debate at all, said the judge.\n\nA litigant who has defied an order of court cannot, in the same breath, seek the courts assistance to avoid paying.\n\nThe ruling reinforces the binding nature of court orders and signals a strong judicial stance against attempts to sidestep financial obligations in divorce settlements.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Social Services (MoHSS) of Namibia has declared an outbreak of Mpox following the confirmation of the first case in Swakopmund, Erongo Region, on 18 October 2025.\n\nThe patient, who is being treated at the Swakopmund District Hospital, is stable and currently isolated, undergoing comprehensive medical care.\n\nThe preliminary investigation into the outbreak has indicated that this transmission may be linked to cross-border travel within the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region. In accordance with World Health Organisation (WHO) protocols, the detection of even a single confirmed case necessitates the declaration of an outbreak, prompting health authorities to launch an immediate response.\n\nThe MoHSS has assured the Namibian public that the countrys robust surveillance system is primed to identify and monitor individuals exhibiting signs of mpox. Additional cases are being actively sought, while health authorities in the Erongo region are closely monitoring the patients immediate contacts to prevent further spread of the virus.\n\nMpox is a zoonotic disease caused by an orthopox virus, resulting in smallpox-like symptoms in humans. This outbreak follows a concerning trend, as multiple countries within Africa, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Zambia, Malawi, and Tanzania, are reporting active mpox cases.\n\nMpox symptoms typically manifest after an incubation period ranging from 5 to 21 days and can include:\n\nThe rash often appears on the face, palms, and soles of the feet, and can also affect the mouth, genitals, and eyes. Symptoms generally last from two to four weeks, during which the infected individuals are capable of transmitting the virus to others.\n\nHuman-to-human transmission occurs primarily through direct contact with respiratory secretions, bodily fluids, or skin lesions of an infected person. The MoHSS outlines several potential avenues for transmission, including:\n\nAs mpox can affect anyone regardless of demographic, the MoHSS urges the public to take preventive measures. These include:\n\nIn light of this outbreak, the MoHSS has mobilised necessary resources to respond effectively, emphasising the importance of public cooperation. Citizens are encouraged to remain calm and to refrain from spreading unverified information, which could instigate unnecessary panic or stigma towards affected individuals and their families.\n\nAs Namibian health officials continue to monitor the situation closely, ongoing updates will be provided to keep the public informed. The health and well-being of all citizens remain a top priority for the government and health authorities.\n\n",

It does not end when the doors close; rather its an ecosystem that connects communities through their stories, said the founder.\n\nThe first edition of the conference saw more than 130 participants from across Africa and the diaspora.\n\nAfrotellers has grown into a continental movement connecting artists, activists and thinkers through community storytelling hubs in Malawi, South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, DR Congo, Lesotho and Zimbabwe.\n\nFrom village gatherings to urban collectives, we are seeing a shared language of resistance, creativity and care emerging across Africa, Chivhanga said.\n\nThis years edition will build on the foundation that was laid in the previous year by exploring storytelling as infrastructure  shaping how Africans imagine themselves, relate to one another and influence how the continent is perceived globally.\n\nSome of the speakers for this years Afrotellers include playwright and scholar Dr Refiloe Lepere, Zimbabwean political organiser Gift Ostallos Siziba, visual activist Prof. Sir Zanele Muholi, Ugandan philanthropy leader Jackie Asiimwe, playwright and director Monageng Vice Motshabi and photographer Andrew Tshabangu.\n\n",

Sikandar Raza (3-30), Newman Nyamhuri (3-42) and Blessing Muzarabani (2-56) were the major stars with the ball as Afghanistan folded for a paltry total of 157. In reply, Zimbabwes opening pair of Ben Curran and Joylord Gumbie negotiated three overs before bad light forced slightly early stumps with Zimbabwe at 6/0. It capped a strong start to the game for the hosts who won a good toss earlier in the morning.\n\nIncessant rains and then wet outfield meant that the first session was entirely lost and Zimbabwes captain Craig Ervine had no hesitation to bowl on winning the toss. After a slightly erratic start with the new ball, the Zimbabwe pacers got their radar right on a pitch that had life in it. Extra bounce was on offer and some seam movement as well, although not as extravagant as generally seen at this venue. Abdul Malik and debutant Riaz Hassan weathered the early storm but both fell in quick succession once Zimbabwes new-ball pairing hit their straps.\n\nIt was, however, a run out that gave Zimbabwe the first breakthrough as Hassan fell to a direct hit from Brian Bennett. It was just the tonic the home side needed and Nyamhuri then got Malik caught behind to give Zimbabwe further momentum in the afternoon session. Rahmat Shah and Hashmatullah Shahidi prevented further damage in the session but Zimbabwe continued to make inroads after tea. The impressive Nyamhuri broke the partnership between last games heroes Rahmat and Shahidi but getting the skipper LBW. Raza then got into the act to castle Rahmat as Afghanistan continued to slip away.\n\nOnce Rahmat fell, it was a procession for the visitors as Raza and Muzarabani sliced through the lower order. If not for comeback man Rashid Khans 20-ball 25, the total would have been much lesser. Even with the tricky nature of the pitch, the Afghanistan were easily about 50-60 runs short although the pitch cannot be judged till both sides bat on it.\n\nBrief scores:Afghanistan 157 (Sikandar Raza 3-30, Newman Nyamhuri 3-30) vs Zimbabwe 6/0\n\n",
