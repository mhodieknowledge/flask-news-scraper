At the heart of the problems is supplier resistance to offering commodities, which are often paid for in local currency.\n\nThe situation has led many suppliers to channel their commodities to the informal market, which often enjoys easy access to the much-needed greenback.\n\nPresenting a trading update for the third quarter period, OK Zimbabwes group company secretary, Margaret Munyuru, bemoaned the impact of the central banks decisions.\n\nThe local currency unit (ZWG) experienced a sharp devaluation at the end of September 2024 as monetary authorities sought to improve the viability of the exchange rate system for the broader economy. Invariably, the devaluation had the net effect of nearly doubling existing US Dollar denominated obligations in loans and creditors balances, she said.\n\nIn September 2024,the RBZdevalued the ZWG currency by 43%to keep pace with exchange rate premiums which had seen the official rate at the time stuck at ZWG13,80 when the parallel market rate had gravitated to a premium of ZWG30 against the greenback.\n\nThe move effectively worsened most retailers and companies balance sheets as they now had to pay more for their debts.\n\nMunyuru said during the period, the group had outstanding and overdue creditorsbalances which were predominantly denominated in US$ sales collection.\n\nShe attributed the low stocking levels to the direct manifestation of sub-economic pricing arising out of exchange rate distortions and suppliers need for foreign currency invoicing to cover their operational and raw material needs.\n\nResultantly, volumes during the period decreased by 36% in comparison to the same period last year. The reduction for the quarter also translated to a 36% revenue decline.\n\nDespite the challenges, the business has since begun to restock with support from suppliers as well as financial institutions that continue to assist with short-term funding structures.\n\nNew alternative procurement models have been developed which include, but are not limited to, a structured stock supply arrangement with a third party for supplier assurance purposes as the business works to restore critical supply relationships with both local and foreign suppliers.\n\nThe fortunes of the countrys formal retail sector hinge on the stability of our exchange rate regime. There is a need for absolute clarity on the roadmap towards a full market-determined exchange rate system. Such a liberalized system will go a long way in restoring the competitiveness of the formal retail sector, added Munyuru.\n\n",

            "content": "The Conversation\n\nHate speech on X was consistently 50% higher for at least eight months after tech billionaire Elon Musk bought the social media platform, new research has found.\n\nThe research looked at the prevalence of overt hate speech including a wide range of racist, homophobic and transphobic slurs.\n\nThe study,published today in PLOS ONE, was conducted by a team of researchers led by Daniel Hickney from the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nIt clearly demonstrates how a platform initiallyinvented to help friends and family stay in touchhas now metamorphosed into a place where hate speech is prolific. This is especially concerning givenhate speech online has been linkedto violent hate crimes offline.\n\nOn October 27 2022, Musk officially purchased X (then known as Twitter) for US$44 billion and became its CEO. His takeover was accompanied by promises toreduce hate speechon the platform andtackle botsand other inauthentic accounts.\n\nBut after he bought X, Musk made several changes to the platform to reduce content moderation. For example,in November 2022 he firedmuch of the companys full time workforce. He also fired outsourced content moderators who tracked abuse on X, despite research showing social medial platforms with high levels of content moderationcontain less hate speech.\n\nThe following month,Musk also disbanded the platforms Trust and Safety Council a volunteer advisory group of independent human rights leaders and academics formed in 2016 to fight hate speech and other problems on the platform.\n\nPrevious researchhas shownhate speech increased on X immediately afterMusk took over. So too did the prevalence of most types of bots.\n\nThis new study is the first to show that this wasnt an anomaly.\n\nThe study examined 4.7 million English language posts on X from the beginning of 2022 through to June 9 2023. This period includes the ten months before Musk bought X and the eight months afterwards.\n\nThe study measured overt hate speech, the meaning of which was clear to anyone who saw it  speech attacking identity groups or using toxic language. It did not measure covert types of hate speech, such ascoded language used by some extremist groupsto spread hate but plausibly deny doing so.\n\nAs well as measuring the amount of hate speech on X, the study also measured how much other users engaged with this material by liking it.\n\nThe researchers access to X data was cut off during the study due to a policy change by the platform, replacing free access to approved academic researchers with payment options which are generally unaffordable. This significantly hampered their ability to collect sample posts. But they dont mention whether it affected their results.\n\nThe study found a clear increase in the average number of posts containing hate speech following Musks purchase of X. Specifically, the volume of posts containing hate speech was consistently 50% higher after Musk took over X compared to beforehand  a jump from an estimated average of 2,179 to 3,246 posts containing hate speech per week.\n\nTransphobic slurs saw the highest increase, rising from an average of roughly 115 posts per week before Musks acquisition to an average of 418 afterwards.\n\nThe level of user engagement with posts containing hate speech also increased under Musks watch. For example, the weekly rate at which hate speech content was liked by users jumped by 70%.\n\nThe researchers say these results suggest either hate speech wasnt taken down, hateful users became more active, the platforms algorithm unintentionally promoted hate speech to users who like such content  or a combination of these possibilities.\n\nThe study also detected no decrease in the activity of inauthentic accounts on X. In fact, it found a potential increase in the number of bot accounts partly based on a large upswing in posts promoting cryptocurrency, which are typically associated with bots.\n\nThere were a number of limitations to the study. For example, it only measured hate speech posts in English, which accounts foronly 31% of postson the platform.\n\nEven so, the study is an important, data-driven deep dive into the state of X. It shows it is a platform where hate speech is prolific. It also shows Musk has failed to fulfil his earlier promises to address problems on X such as hate speech and bot activity.\n\nAsMusk himself saidat the White House earlier this week: Some of the things I say will be incorrect and should be corrected.\n\nAssociate professor, Institute for Governance and Policy Analysis, University of Canberra, University of Canberra\n\nThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.Read the original articlehere.\n\n",

            "content": "Nigeria Health Watch\n\nPamelaArikuretis grandchild, who is nearly two years old, has been severely affected by the widespread malnutrition in Mudzi, Zimbabwe. The young girl has not gained any weight for the past six months,We give her plain maize porridge every morning because thats what we can afford,Pamela explained.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, a severe drought worsened by the El Nio phenomenonhas triggered a malnutrition crisis threatening the health and livelihoods of vulnerable communities across the country.\n\nWith staple crop yields plummeting and food prices skyrocketing, families like Pamelas are facing dire food shortages, leading to increased rates of stunting and wastingamong children. Most days, we eat Sadza [a maize meal] and okra for lunch and the same meal for dinner. It has been a difficult year for us due to the drought as we did not harvest anything.At times, we have to sleep on our empty stomachs,she adds.\n\nThe situation is no better in Nigeria, particularly in the northern region, where ongoing conflict and insecurity have worsened the crisis. Armed violence has displaced countless families, cutting off their access to farmland. Coupled withrising inflationand soaring food prices, manyNigerians are struggling with hunger.\n\n As humanitarian organisations scramble to provide relief, the long-term consequences of this nutritional emergency could hinder the recovery and development of Nigeria and Zimbabwes for years to come. This highlights the urgent need for immediate assistance and sustainable agricultural practices to combat the effects of climate change.\n\nIn Nigeria and Zimbabwe, children pay the price\n\nAccording to the United Nations Childrens Fund (UNICEF), 2 million children in Nigeria are suffering from malnutrition. The organisation also reported that the country has the second-highest burden of stunted children globally, with a national prevalence rate of 32% among children under five.\n\nIn Zimbabwe,24% of children aged 0 to 5suffer are stunted, with boys more likely to be affected than girls. The UNICEF further reported that just 10% of children (623 months) receive an acceptable diet, and the children in the poorest homes are twice as likely to be stunted.\n\nEl Nios impact in Zimbabwe\n\nEl Nio is a complex climate phenomenon characterised by the periodic warming of sea surface temperatures in the Central and Eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. This warming disrupts normal weather patterns, leading to significant global climatic effects. Typically occurring every few years, El Nio can influence weather events such as increased rainfall and flooding in some regions, while causing droughts and higher temperatures in others.\n\nAccording to the Famine Early Warning System(FEWS) Network, dry and very hot conditions have limited planting activities across much of the country  following cumulatively low rainfall. This has resulted in a decline in market maize grain availability as more households increase their dependence on market purchases.\n\nThe 2024 Zimbabwe LivelihoodsAssessment report(ZIMLaC) further indicates a decline in access to a minimum acceptable diet in the majority of Zimbabwes provinces.Women like Pamela are now forced to stretch their meagre resources to feed their families.\n\nIn the past, we were able to support ourselves through subsistence farming during periods of exceptionally heavy rainfall. We used to feed our kids well-balanced meals, but that is no longer the case because we dont harvest anything from our fields anymore,she said.\n\nTatenda Chimutu, a nutritionist, said malnutrition rates in Mudzi have also increased due to inadequate funds for scaling up nutrition interventions. The situation has worsened, food insecurity increased from 31% in 2023 to 64% in 2024. Wasting has also increased compared to last year,he explained.\n\nTatenda reported that the community response to this crisis has been through local health centres, which provide nutrition counselling, community-based nutrition programmes. Traditional leaders have been advocating for nutrition education,while self-help groups promote kitchen gardening. In addition, partnerships with Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) have provided food aid and support.\n\nHowever, for first-time mothers like 22-year-old Dorothy Ngaufe, the food aid from NGOs has only provided a temporary solution to her nutrition challenges.The only assistance we received was in the form of groceries consisting of peanut butter, cooking oil,Kapenta,and beans once per month for three months. This was specifically meant for my 2-year-old daughter, but this has since been stopped,she explained.As of now we have nothing, my daughter is facing severe malnutrition as we hardly have anything to eat. My daughter only weighs eight kilograms.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO),the average weight for a 2-year-old girl is 12 kilograms.\n\nConflict and banditry worsen malnutrition in Nigeria\n\nThe rise of banditry in northwest Nigeria has led tofrequent kidnapping for ransomsand attacks on villages and schools. Once a peaceful farming community, Tungar Adaka, a village in Zamfara, has become a target, forcing residents like Zainab Shafiu, 37, to flee.\n\nFor over a decade,banditry has claimed over 8,000 lives in the northwest, and over 1 million people had been displaced. The number keeps rising. According to the International Rescue Committee (IRC), at least 10,000 people weredisplacedin Zamfara and Sokoto states due to armed attacks between March and April 2024.\n\nZainabs three-year-old son was diagnosed with malnutrition in June 2024 due to the lack of basic living items in displacement camps. I noticed he began to look pale, suffered from diarrhea, lost weight, and became weaker,Zainab said.Bandits have taken control of the villages. No one can farm, so theres very little food for my son. My husband hasnt farmed for three years and [does not] earn enough from mining to keep us [well fed].\n\nTo treat her son, Zainab took him to a primary healthcare center, where he was given ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF). While her son has shown improvement, Zainab remains deeply worried without a steady food supply.\n\nA call for urgent intervention\n\nCurrent food systems in both countries dont seem to address the problem of child malnutrition comprehensively. We need the government to support us with food and shelter,Zainab urged, echoing a similar call from Doctors Without Borders/Mdecins Sans Frontires (MSF).\n\nIn September 2024, MSFurgedfor increased efforts to address the escalating malnutrition crisis in Northwest Nigeria. MSF reported a sharp rise in severely malnourished children with life-threatening complications. It is worried that even though one in four children are malnourished, the region remains excluded from the United Nations Humanitarian Response Plan.\n\nHowever, Damba Rabiu, a doctor at a clinic in Gusau, the capital of Zamfara, noted that ignorance and poverty exacerbate the crisis. He explained that some mothers, after receiving nutritional supplements, sell part of them to meet other pressing needs.\n\nSome parents are short-changing their children. If a child is supposed to receive two sachets of nutritional supplements per day for seven days, that adds up to 14 sachets. However, some children only receive two sachets for the entire week, as parents sell the rest or use them for other family members. As a result, the child doesnt get the nutrition required for recovery,Dr. Rabiu said.\n\nBut this is largely due to circumstance rather than negligence on the part of parent. For example, the price of cooking a pot of Jollof Rice, a Nigerian staple food,went upfrom about 16,000 in March 2024 to over 20,000 in June 2024. This means families are now spending almost 20% more on the same meal in just a few months. In desperate situations where multiple children are malnourished in a household, mothers are forced to make the decision to find food for the entire household.\n\nJoy Alejo, a pediatric neurologist at the University College Hospital in Ibadan, noted thatwhen children dont get enough food for proper brain development, youre limiting their potential for inventions, innovations, and achievements. The government needs to address this urgently.\n\nWhile the brain continues to develop after age five, the early years are crucial for laying the foundation for future growth.Alejo also shares concerns about the insecurity, stating that it has driven doctors away from the region, limiting the care available to malnourished children.\n\nEnding malnutrition\n\nTatenda, the nutritionist in Zimbabwe, explained ways to end malnutrition, including short- and long-term solutions.Food assistance programmes, is one he said, includingemergency nutrition intervention programmes, nutrition and healthcare service outreaches.\n\nFor the long-term, he added that people need to practice sustainable agriculture initiatives and there is a need for economic empowerment programmes that can benefit people. On a policy level, there is a need for policy changes supporting nutrition and food security,he said.\n\nDr. Ibrahim Baba Shatambaya, a political scientist and public policy expert in Nigeria, noted that insecurity is something every serious government should do everything to tackle, especially in rural areas, to guarantee food security.\n\nHe also emphasised that,to tackle malnutrition effectively, there must be a strong partnership between the government and international organisations. This collaboration should focus on mapping areas where malnourished children are located, identifying the affected individuals, and implementing targeted interventions. These efforts will ensure a direct response to their needs and work toward preventing malnutrition in the future.\n\n",

Moreover, it was affected by disruptions to supply chains due to the civil unrest in Mozambique.\n\nWe encountered supply chain disruptions with raw materials arriving via Beira Port, stemming from the political unrest in Mozambique following the disputed election results. Although the raw materials were ultimately received, the delays impacted our delivery capabilities during the festive season, said Van Gend.\n\nHowever, it is the yet to be resolved Zimbabwean economic challenges that the company expects to further affect demand, as the wholesale and retail sectors navigate considerable branch closures that threaten the sustainability of businesses.\n\nDuring the quarter under review, Nampak Zimbabwe reported 23% lower revenues in US dollar terms while trading profit for the period declined by 56%.\n\nThis decrease in revenue reflects the reduced demand across all business units, said the company.\n\nNonetheless, gross profit margins for the period held steady compared to the previous year, while the trading profit margin experienced a 9% drop. Nampak Zimbabwe attributed the reduction in trading margin to the hyperinflation accounting effects from the prior years comparative period.\n\nThe quarter period under review was fraught with fluctuations in exchange rates following a significant depreciation of the local currency.\n\nThe biggest impact though came from increasing challenges with power supply, limiting the companys ability to fully meet customer demand. To mitigate this, Nampak Zimbabwe has had to install generator capacity.\n\n",

That is clear as day.\n\nI think those who really are Zanu PF at the heart go by the rules in decorum of Zanu PF. We have other people who are in Zanu PF in themselves are not Zanu PF but they dress in the Zanu PF regalia. So we must always see when people talk and they see to which camp they belong as they open their mouths, said Mnangagwa.\n\nWe have people in ZANU PF who themselves are not ZANU PF President Emmerson Mnangagwa during a meeting with selected news editors.\n\nMnangagwa added that he will step down after completing his 2 terms.\n\nFollowhttps://t.co/iVVKatR4Q0WhatsApp Channel for news updates pic.twitter.com/U2jGaKzku0\n\n NewZimbabwe.com (@NewZimbabweCom)February 17, 2025\n\nMnangagwa has publicly insisted that he will not stand in the next elections, despite a resolution from Zanu PF to push for the amendment of the constitution.\n\nHowever, the sincerity of his public declaration is under scrutiny, as he has not rebuked or cracked down on the 2030 proponents within Zanu PF.\n\nFormer Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) spokesperson, Fadzayi Mahere, said Mnangagwas declaration reeks of a public stunt.\n\nDoes he plan to cause any amendments to the Constitution? If his parliamentary super-majority changes the Constitution to extend his term, will he comply? This face-saving, word-twisting approbation and reprobation simply doesnt cut it, said Mahere.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nControversial tenderpreneur Wicknell Chivayo has backed the extension of President Emmerson Mnangagwas rule beyond the constitutionally stipulated two-term limit, inserting himself into the ruling partys ongoing factional battles, which show no signs of abating.\n\nThe push to extend Mnangagwas rule has deepened divisions within the ruling party, with two factions emerging at loggerheads. One faction, loyal to Mnangagwa, is advocating for the suspension of the 2028 elections to allow him to remain in power until 2030.\n\nMeanwhile, another faction, believed to be aligned with Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, is pushing for adherence to the constitutional term limits.\n\nChivayo, a beneficiary of controversial government deals, has apparently chosen a side in the factional dispute, praising Mnangagwa for having done exceptionally well.\n\nThis development in the USA got me deeply reflecting on our beloved Country, where H. E. President Mnangagwa has demonstrated remarkable leadership. In my opinion, when a leader is delivering exceptional results, their presidency should not be cut short, especially if the people overwhelmingly support his continued leadership. Even the opposition in Zimbabwe, despite being fragmanted, recently agreed to this concept.\n\nI personally believe that progress must take precedence over procedural constraints created by a Constitution. Most will say Im singing for my supper and yes indeed, without a shadow of doubt, I will also sing for breakfast and lunch too.\n\nIn my view, a performing President like President E.D must be allowed to complete his vision for the nation. The will of the people should always be at the core of democracy. As we have seen in the U.S.A, policy inconsistencies caused by frequent leadership changes disrupt national progress, said Chivayo in a post on his social media posts.\n\nMnangagwa has, on numerous occasions, publicly rejected the idea of a term extension. On Monday, he told several state media editors that he would not seek to remain in office beyond 2028.\n\nHowever, a section of veterans of the liberation struggle, led by Blessed Geza, has accused Mnangagwa of insincerity. They have demanded his resignation, accusing him of presiding over widespread corruption.\n\nPolitical commentator Youngerson Matete avers that Chivayos support for the term extension is motivated by a desire to facilitate questionable deals and corruption.\n\nYou are criminal Chikurubhi bound, so it is normal that you will support the mutilation of our constitution to allow Mnangagwa to stay not because he is delivering but because you keep looting our tax and get his protection but the day of reckoning is coming Chigananda, said Matete.\n\nActivist Setfree Mafukidze said Mnangagwas clique should not hold the country to ransom by desecrating the constitution.\n\nOur national constitution should not and will not be tempered with to suit ED, we came up with this constitution in 2013 and there is a reason we all supported a maximum of 2 terms per President, we all wanted to avoid exactly what ED is doing today.\n\nThere is no one man who can run the country forever which is why even President Mugabe was removed from power through a coup by ED and his colleagues.\n\nOur country is not a playground and this agenda will fail dismally, it will be a disaster if ED persists on this route,it will backfire spectacularly. We are not going to allow failed leadership to continue, it wont happen, said Mafukidze.\n\n",
