            "content": "IOL\n\nThe Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) have announced a dramatic venue change, in an unexpected twist in the lead-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers next month.\n\nTheir pivotal clash against South Africas Bafana Bafana, originally slated for South African soil, will now take place at the Obed Itani Chilume Stadium in Francistown, Botswana, on October 10, 2025.\n\nThis decision comes about because Zimbabwe have issues with hosting international matches at home due to a FIFA ban stemming from stadium concerns.\n\nZimbabwe have previously held their home qualifiers in South Africa, specifically utilising popular venues such as Orlando Stadium. The transition to Botswana is seen as a move to create a more logistical and fan-friendly environment for their supporters.\n\nLocal sources from the Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) report that the decision aims to make the match more accessible for both the Warriors fans. The move is significant as the fixture serves as a milestone in South Africas quest for World Cup qualification.\n\nAs it stands, South Africa leads the standings in Group C with 17 points from eight matches, putting them in pole position for qualification. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe languishes at the bottom with only four points, a stark reflection of their struggleshaving won merely two of their last 27 qualifiers since 2010.\n\nThis latest venue change adds further intrigue to a match that, while less critical for Zimbabwes aspirations, could serve as a defining moment for a Bafana squad looking to solidify their World Cup journey.\n\nThe Obed Itani Chilume Stadium, which boasts a capacity of 26,000, has been recognised as a reliable venue, previously hosting Namibia during their World Cup qualifiers, thus demonstrating its capability to cater to international football standards.\n\nThis choice of location not only provides a neutral ground but also enhances accessibility for Zimbabwean fans, who usually faced no challenges attending matches in South Africa.\n\nDespite Zimbabwes elimination from World Cup contention following a disappointing series of resultsincluding losses to Benin and Rwandathis encounter with the Bafana is unlikely to diminish local interest. Providing a stage to showcase talent, the upcoming match may serve more as a platform for national pride and a precursor to the upcoming 2025 Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nHowever, the venue shift has left many fans puzzled; while the location changes, Zimbabwes hopeless position in the qualifiers is still unchanged. The decision ultimately raises questions about ZIFAs administrative strategy, especially as Zimbabwe prepares to face South Africa, Nigeria, and Lesotho, a task that seems more metaphorical than consequential.\n\nThe president of the Botswana Football Association, Tariq Babitseng, confirmed the hosting arrangement, emphasising the significance of this contest for Bafana as they aim for a win to bolster their World Cup bid.\n\nWith anticipation building, all eyes will be on Francistown this October, regardless of the unpredictable journey Zimbabwes Warriors have faced in their World Cup qualifiers.\n\n",

            "content": "ByAlois Vinga\n\nThe Zimbabwe Investment Development Agency (ZIDA) has expressed concern that local miners are not taking advantage of its Mining Claims Matchmaking platform, despite its vast potential to unlock critical investment opportunities.\n\nThe platform was created to connect mining claim holders in Zimbabwe with both local and international investors. It is designed to facilitate partnerships for technical support, tributary agreements, joint ventures, debt funding, or even the outright sale of mining claims.\n\nAccording to ZIDA, the service is open to all mining claim holders in Zimbabwe, whether individuals, companies, or syndicates, regardless of their scale of operation.\n\nTo use the platform, claim holders are required to upload their identification documents, claim registration certificate, valid inspection certificate, and a site map.\n\nBut speaking during a plenary discussion at the 2025 Environmental Social Governance Conference convened by the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Organisation (ZELO) and Silveira House on the sidelines of the Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba in Bulawayo, the ZIDA Legal Manager, Chidochashe Ncube, said local miners were not tapping into the platforms potential.\n\nThere seems to be a lack of trust by locals who suspect the risk of losing their claims. Locals want to go behind the scenes and the few who come forth only do after being shortchanged by the potential investors.\n\nThe public must be aware that this platform has a number of benefits like assistance in identifying ethical investors, contract drafting and professional advice on business-related issues, she said.\n\nNcube said such platforms also enhance the strengthening of ESG standards since matched parties easily fall under the authorities surveillance.\n\nQuizzed by one David Bote on why ZIDA appears to be pro-foreign investors as opposed to locals in rendering assistance, Ncube dismissed the claims, arguing that locals are not willing to come forth and exhaust available opportunities.\n\nIt is incorrect. The fact of the matter is that foreigners first port of call is usually the ZIDA because they do not know anyone around. In contras,t locals often bypass the Agency, opting to engage their connections instead, only to look for us when this goes off hand, added Ncube.\n\n",

Opposition MPs are demanding the immediate suspension of the deportation deal until parliament ratifies it, saying this was required under Ghanaian law.\n\nLast week, Ghanas President John Mahama said that 14 deportees of West African origin had arrived in the country following an agreement reached with the US.\n\nHe later said that all of them had been returned to their countries of origin, though Foreign Minister Samuel Okudzeto Ablakwa contradicted him by saying that only most of them had been returned.\n\nMr Vormawors court application contradicts both of them, saying that 11 deportees are still in detention in Ghana.\n\nThe 11 were held in a US detention facility before being shackled and deported in a military cargo aircraft, according to papers filed in court.\n\nThe deportations are part of the US governments hard-line approach towards immigration since President Donald Trump took office in January.\n\nHe has vowed to conduct record-level deportations of migrants in the country illegally.\n\nGhanas foreign minister was quoted on Monday by Reuters news agency as saying the decision to accept the deportees was based on humanitarian principle and pan-African empathy.\n\nThis should not be misconstrued as an endorsement of the immigration policies of the Trump administration, he said.\n\nFive of the detainees, three Nigerians and two Gambians, have also sued the US government, arguing that they were protected by a court order and should not have been deported.\n\n",

It undermines trust in financial institutions and affects genuine policyholders, said the NPAZ.\n\nThe NPAZ says it has come out to descend heavily on insurance fraudsters.\n\nThe justice system will continue to impose tough penalties to deter such conduct, added NPAZ\n\nThe warning by prosecutors comes following the jailing of a 40-year-old Zvishavane man, Promise Banda, who faked his daughters death in order to defraud Ecosure Insurance Company (Econet Wireless) of US$6,250 in death benefits.\n\nThe court heard that on July 29, 2025, Banda misrepresented to Ecosure Insurance Company that his daughter, Chipo Enia Banda, had passed away.\n\nProsecutors proved that the accused person forged a Child Health Card, changing details to create a fictitious dependent. He then used the forged document to acquire a burial order number 526/25 from the Zvishavane District Registrars Office.\n\nThe offender submitted the burial order and false claims online to Ecosure Insurance Company, seeking to fraudulently obtain US$6,250 in death benefits.\n\nFollowing an investigation, authorities established that the supposed beneficiary did not exist and that the offender had acted intentionally to defraud the insurance firm.\n\nThe court found Banda guilty of fraud, noting that such schemes are deliberate attacks on financial institutions and erode public trust in insurance systems.\n\nAs a result, Banda was convicted of insurance fraud and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, of which four months were suspended on condition of good behaviour. He will, therefore, serve an effective 14 months behind bars.\n\n",

Instead of creating a limited-access account as requested by a United Nations consultant working on the project, they allegedly built a hidden account with full administrative rights.\n\nUsing this backdoor, they manipulated clearing agents prepayment accounts, inserting fictitious deposits to make it appear as if customs duties had been paid. In reality, no money was received by ZIMRA. \n\nThe agents were then able to clear goods duty-free while the accused allegedly collected cash from them, sharing the proceeds.\n\nThe scam ran undetected for months, with prosecutors telling the court that by abusing their positions, the accused acted contrary to their duties as public officers, showing favour to themselves and prejudice to ZIMRA.\n\nNothing has been recovered from the multi-million-dollar fraud.\n\nThe two were remanded in custody pending finalisation of their bail hearing.\n\n",

We work with the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage, as well as the V.I.D., who are supposed to be on the road. Sometimes you find accidents soon after crossing those checkpoints.\n\nI would like to inform the House that the Home Affairs ministry has since procured speed trap equipment as well as breathalysers, said Mhona.\n\nHe added that stricter regulations had been introduced for public transport drivers, particularly those driving buses and haulage trucks.\n\nI know that in the past people were just driving lorries through Class 2. We have since set up a Stationary Instrument but right now, we are saying you start with Class 4 going upwards, you cannot start with Class 2.\n\nFor one to drive public transport, buses or commuter buses, you have to be above 30 years. In the past, people were driving at the ages of 21, 22 or 25, Mhona explained.\n\nZanu PF MP Vairet Nhari had questioned the licensing process for drivers who, immediately after acquiring a Class 1 or Class 2 licence, were already operating public transport vehicles with little to no experience.\n\nConcerns were also raised over unlicensed drivers and unregistered vehicles. CCC legislator Miriam Matinenga pressed the minister on governments enforcement measures.\n\nSome people are driving vehicles without licences. Also, what is government policy with regard to ensuring that all vehicles are registered because we are noticing that some drivers are driving vehicles that have no registration numbers? she asked.\n\nMhona responded that the law requires all vehicles to be registered and insured before being used on public roads.\n\nCCC Marondera Central MP Caston Matewu called for a revamp of the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe (TSCZ), which he described as toothless.\n\nWhen drivers come across the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe, which has a lot of roadblocks across the country, they often laugh because it is meaningless. What is Government policy on ensuring that we give teeth to the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe so they will also be able to give penalties to drivers? Matewu said.\n\nMhona replied that Parliament has the mandate to strengthen the TSCZ through legislation, noting that processes to empower the council as an agency were already underway.\n\n",
