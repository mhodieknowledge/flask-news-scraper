She was detained and spent Tuesday night in police holding cells awaiting court appearance this Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement, the Zimbabwe Union of Journalists (ZUJ) condemned the arrest, describing it as the criminalisation of journalism.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Union of Journalists (ZUJ) condemns strongly the arrest and detention of Faith Zaba, Zimbabwe Independent Editor by the Zimbabwe Republic Police.\n\nZaba was arrested over a satirical Muckraker column published last Friday in the Zimbabwe Independent, which authorities claim undermined the authority of the President.\n\nAs a Union, we are deeply disturbed by the criminalisation of journalism over editorial content that falls squarely within the boundaries of journalistic expression and satire. Satirical commentary, whether critical or humorous, is protected speech and should not be criminalised, said ZUJ.\n\nWhat makes this incident more concerning is that it comes in the wake of the recently launched Media Policy by His Excellency President Emmerson Mnangagwa, a policy which pledges to promote an open, tolerant, and free media environment.\n\nZabas arrest and treatment runs counter to the spirit and commitments of this policy, and risk undermining confidence in the governments professed reform agenda.\n\nZUJ is also alarmed by reports that Zaba, who is suffering from a serious illness, was detained overnight despite medical confirmation of her condition.This raises grave concerns about her health, safety, and the proportionality of the actions taken by law enforcement.\n\nZUJ called for the immediate and unconditional release of Zaba.\n\nWe therefore demand the immediate and unconditional release of Faith Zaba.

Zambia and Zimbabwe are among the hardest hit countries, facing frequent power outages due to reduced water levels in Lake Kariba, which have caused a 25% drop in hydroelectric output.\n\nParticipants are expected to review the progress of the Mission 300 initiative, a project backed by the World Bank and African Development Bank that aims to expand energy access to 600 million people in the region by 2030, with the first target being 300 million.\n\nThe agenda also includes discussions on developing the petroleum and gas sectors, as well as adopting emerging technologies such as green hydrogen and smart grids. The Ministers will consider recommendations from a recent regional dialogue on ensuring a just transition to sustainable energy in Southern Africa.\n\nOn the water front, the meeting will evaluate advances in transboundary water management projects, led by River Basin Organisations and other shared institutions, including groundwater and livelihood support programmes.\n\nProfessor Obert Jiri, Permanent Secretary in Zimbabwes Ministry of Lands, Agriculture and Water Development and Chair of the water officials committee, highlighted the critical link between energy and water resources.\n\nSolar power and energy recovered from landfill gases demonstrate the close relationship between water and energy, he said. Managing water resources effectively is vital, not just for energy generation but also as a response to climate change.

            "content": "CNN\n\nTelevangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who became a household name amassing an enormous following and multimillion-dollar ministry only to be undone by his penchant for prostitutes, has died.\n\nSwaggart died decades after his once vast audience dwindled and his name became a punchline on late night television. His death was announced Tuesday on his public Facebook page. A cause wasnt immediately given, though at 90 he had been in poor health.\n\nThe Louisiana native was best known for being a captivating Pentecostal preacher with a massive following before being caught on camera with a prostitute in New Orleans in 1988, one of a string of successful TV preachers brought down in the 1980s and 90s by sex scandals. He continued preaching for decades, but with a reduced audience.\n\nSwaggart encapsulated his downfall in a tearful 1988 sermon, in which he wept and apologized but made no reference to his connection to a prostitute.\n\nI have sinned against you, Swaggart told parishioners nationwide. I beg you to forgive me.\n\nHe announced his resignation from the Assemblies of God later that year, shortly after the church said it was defrocking him for rejecting punishment it had ordered for moral failure. The church had wanted him to undergo a two-year rehabilitation program, including not preaching for a full year.\n\nSwaggart said at the time that he knew dismissal was inevitable but insisted he had no choice but to separate from the church to save his ministry and Bible college.\n\nSwaggart grew up poor, the son of a preacher, in a music-rich family. He excelled at piano and gospel music, playing and singing with talented cousins who took different paths: rock-n-rollerJerry Lee Lewisand country singerMickey Gilley.\n\nIn his hometown of Ferriday, Louisiana, Swaggart said he first heard the call of God at age 8. The voice gave him goose bumps and made his hair tingle, he said.\n\nEverything seemed different after that day in front of the Arcade Theater, he said in a 1985 interview with the Jacksonville Journal-Courier in Illinois. I felt better inside. Almost like taking a bath.\n\nHe preached and worked part time in oil fields until he was 23. He then moved entirely into his ministry: preaching, playing piano and singing gospel songs with the barrelhouse fervor of cousin Lewis at Assemblies of God revivals and camp meetings.\n\nSwaggart started a radio show, a magazine, and then moved into television, with outspoken views.\n\nHe called Roman Catholicism a false religion. It is not the Christian way, and claimed that Jews suffered for thousands of years because of their rejection of Christ.\n\nIf you dont like what I say, talk to my boss, he once shouted as he strode in front of his congregation at his Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, where his sermons moved listeners to speak in tongues and stand up as if possessed by the Holy Spirit.\n\nSwaggarts messages stirred thousands of congregants and millions of TV viewers, making him a household name by the late 1980s. Contributors built Jimmy Swaggart Ministries into a business that made an estimated $142 million in 1986.\n\nHis Baton Rouge complex still includes a worship center and broadcasting and recording facilities.\n\nSwaggarts downfall came in the late 1980s as other prominent preachers faced similar scandals. Swaggart said publicly that his earnings were hurt in 1987 by the sex scandal surroundingrival televangelist Jim Bakkerand a former church secretary at Bakkers PTL ministry organization.\n\nJimmy Swaggart Ministry/WBRZ-TV/Bettmann/Getty Images\n\nThe following year, Swaggart was photographed at a hotel with Debra Murphree, an admitted prostitute who told reporters that the two did not have sex but that the preacher had paid her to pose nude.\n\nShe later repeated the claim  and posed nude  for Penthouse magazine.\n\nThe surveillance photos that crippled Swaggarts career apparently stemmed from his rivalry with preacher Marvin Gorman, whom Swaggart had accused of sexual misdeeds. Gorman hired the photographer who captured Swaggart and Murphree on film. Swaggart later paid Gorman $1.8 million to settle a lawsuit over the sexual allegations against Gorman.\n\nMore trouble came in 1991, when police in California detained Swaggart with another prostitute. The evangelist was charged with driving on the wrong side of the road and driving an unregistered Jaguar. His companion, Rosemary Garcia, said Swaggart became nervous when he saw the police car and weaved when he tried to stuff pornographic magazines under a car seat.\n\nSwaggart was later mocked by the late TV comic Phil Hartman, who impersonated him on NBCs Saturday Night Live.\n\nThe evangelist largely stayed out of the news in later years but remained in the pulpit at Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, often joined by his son, Donnie, a fellow preacher. His radio station broadcast church services and gospel music to 21 states, and Swaggarts ministry boasted a worldwide audience on the internet.\n\nTheres been no greater example of a good and faithful servant than my father. No ifs, ands and buts about it. A man who lived his life for the cause of Christ, Donnie Swaggart said in avideo message sharedon social media Sunday about his dads final days.\n\nThe preacher caused another brief stir in 2004 with remarks about being looked at amorously by a gay man.\n\nAnd Im going to be blunt and plain: If one ever looks at me like that, Im going to kill him and tell God he died, Jimmy Swaggart said, to laughter from the congregation. He later apologized.\n\nSwaggart made few public appearances outside his church, save for singing Amazing Grace at the 2005 funeral of Louisiana Secretary of State Fox McKeithen, a prominent name in state politics for decades.\n\nIn 2022, he shared memories at thememorial servicefor Lewis, his cousin and rock n roll pioneer.
