            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nOutspoken former legislator Temba Mliswa has lashed out at Presidential Spokesperson George Charamba, accusing him of mishandling the controversy surrounding the planned but ultimately failed October 17 protests called by war veteran Blessed Geza.\n\nAhead of the protests, a fake statement purportedly from Vice President (Rtd) Constantino Chiwenga condemning the demonstrations circulated on social media.\n\nCharamba responded by emphasising the misuse of government stationery, while admitting that the letter carried a well-intentioned message.\n\nAbuse of government stationery: Kindly note that the message below, however well-intentioned, has been pasted on government stationery, without the knowledge, involvement, or sanction of the Department of Presidential Communications, to which the original stationery belongs, Charamba posted on his X account.\n\nMliswa, however, accused Charamba of deliberately deflecting attention from the more pressing issue,the protests themselves.\n\nHis solution was to evade the greater matter of the contents of the letter and instead lavish disproportionate amounts of self-righteous anger on the abuse of government stationery, Mliswa wrote on X on Thursday.\n\nHe added that Charambas response betrayed his palaver with power on both ends,for now with ED and for the future with a clique embedded within the system.\n\nPeople were worried about the demonstration and messages around it more than that paper! His failure to leverage on this ended up as a sanctioning of the demonstration, he said.\n\nMliswa also questioned Charambas apparent reluctance to strongly denounce the planned protests, saying this was out of character for a Presidential Spokesperson.\n\nAnyone familiar with his conduct and antics through his multiple ghost accounts could clearly pick out the dragging of feet. While cause existed to restrain abuse of government communication channels, an even greater cause of existential importance called for more. He offered none! he said.\n\nMliswa further accused Charamba of acting like a social media bully, using pseudo accounts to attack opponents,behavior he said was unbecoming of a Presidential Spokesperson and damaging to President Emmerson Mnangagwas image.\n\nOver time, as DCS, he has simply become a wild bully without professional decorum in public engagements, encapsulated by incessant insults of Dununu against any contrary thought or individual.\n\nIts shocking behaviour for someone who is the Presidential Spokesperson and should have drawn government censure long ago, as it brings the President and the Office into disrepute. The absence of such has seemingly emboldened him to grow even coarser into the grating maverick around whom many tiptoe, fearful of getting a revolting rant.\n\nWe cant have a Presidential Spokesperson who is toxic and personal in his engagements, tarnishing the name and standing of the President. These are the kinds of things which the Chief Secretary should bring to the President, Mliswa added.\n\nMliswas criticism comes shortly after he accused Charamba of sleeping on duty, claiming exiled former minister Jonathan Moyo was doing a better job defending Mnangagwa on the controversial 2030 presidential term limit debate.\n\nIn response to the repeated attacks, Charamba dismissed Mliswa as irrelevant, saying he was not worth engaging.\n\n",

            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo, IOL\n\nNews that Zimbabwes ruling Zanu PF party wants to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas term of office to 2030 has drawn mixed reactions from Zimbabweans living in South Africa. Many say the move reflects the deepening political stagnation that forced them to leave home in the first place, while others argue that Mnangagwa has performed better than his predecessor, Robert Mugabe, and deserves more time to continue the countrys recovery.\n\nZanu PF announced plans to begin the process of extending Mnangagwas term of office by two years a move that, if successful, would keep him in power until 2030. The proposal was formally endorsed at the partys annual national peoples conference in the eastern city of Mutare over the weekend, where delegates instructed government structures to start drafting legislation to amend the constitution.\n\nChairperson of the Zimbabwe Community in South Africa, Ngqabutho Nicholas Mabhena, warned that the move would spell disaster for the landlocked nation.\n\nChairperson of the Zimbabwe Community in South Africa, Ngqabutho Nicholas Mabhena Image: Facebook\n\nAs the Zimbabwe Community in South Africa we condemn the action taken by Zanu PF to propose postponing elections to 2030. We want to participate in the elections in 2028. We want the parliament in Zimbabwe to give way for the diaspora vote, Mabhena told IOL.\n\nAll of us, given what is obtaining in South Africa, with Operation Dudula and other anti-migrant organisations, we believe that we can only stabilise our economy when we have resolved the political question. The political question can only be resolved through an election. If elections are postponed, we do not see any resolution of the political question, which would lead to rebuilding of the Zimbabwean economy so that we who are in South Africa can return home.\n\nOn the other hand, prominent businessman, lawyer, and socialite Moreboys Munetsi said his main concern was helping the large number of Zimbabweans in South Africa who continue to face challenges around documentation, healthcare, and employment.\n\nProminent businessman, lawyer, and socialite Moreboys Munetsi said his main concern was helping the large number of Zimbabweans in South Africa Image: Facebook\n\nPeople who are in the diaspora have been left out of economic opportunities in Zimbabwes sectors like mining and agriculture. The environment here in South Africa has become very hostile, especially to the Zimbabwe community  they really want to go back home. What makes Zimbabweans continue to stay in South Africa is that they have no idea how to survive once they get home, Munetsi told IOL.\n\nPerhaps the government of Zimbabwe could avail some funding to help its people, particularly those who are in South Africa. You can see foreigners have been blocked from accessing hospitals and certain companies. So my observation is that Zimbabweans in South Africa desire to return home, but they do not know how to survive once they are in Zimbabwe.\n\nOn behalf of the Zimbabwe Immigration Federation and the Zimbabwe Democratic Congress, Luke Mufaro Dzviti said he was deeply disappointed by Zanu PFs resolution.\n\nThe recent move by Zanu PF seeking to extend President Mnangagwas term to the year 2030 is very disappointing, unconstitutional and proof that Zanu PFmadhalas(old men) want to capture Zimbabwe more than what the Guptas and Vusimuzi Cat Matlala did in South Africa, said Dzviti.\n\nExtending Emmerson Mnangagwas tenure to 2030 is a catastrophe of monumental proportions to Zimbabwe  to Zimbabweans who are sick and tired of Zanu PFs bad governance, corruption and tyranny. This has come at a time when my party was finishing structures, a manifesto and other paperwork while fielding members of parliament in all 210 constituencies to try and make Zimbabwe great again sooner and not in the future of 2030.\n\nNot all Zimbabweans share this view. Cross-border truck driver Ishmael Gwatidzo, a Zanu PF supporter, welcomed the proposed extension.\n\nI think we have not seen an influx of Zimbabweans fleeing hardship ever since President Mnangagwa took office. We must not be quick to forget. The problem we are faced with now is how to get Zimbabweans who are in South Africa back home, but a few years back, there was pressure at the border with Zimbabweans fleeing, Gwatidzo said.\n\nWhat you get now is Zimbabweans travelling to other countries like Botswana, South Africa and Mozambique to buy goods and return home. Even our road infrastructure has improved. I think Zanu PF was right  President Mnangagwa has unfinished business.\n\nFormer Zimbabwean cabinet minister and former national political commissar of Zanu- PF, Saviour Tyson Kasukuwere spoke to IOL Image:Chipo Musarurwa Siziba/X\n\nOn Wednesday,IOL also reported that former Zanu PF heavyweight and cabinet minister Saviour Kasukuwere rubbished the partys planto extend Mnangagwas term, warning that it would end badly for both the president and the country.\n\nSpeaking to IOL, Kasukuwere said: He (Mnangagwa) is dreaming, and he has set himself up for a gigantic failure. Greediness knows no boundaries, and this will lead to a huge disaster for the country.\n\nKasukuwere, once a senior figure in the Zanu PF government led by Robert Mugabe before going into exile during the 2017 military intervention, has become one of the most prominent former insiders to publicly condemn the move to extend Mnangagwas rule.\n\n",

            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo, IOL\n\nThe Road Accident Fund (RAF) has confirmed thatvictims and families affected by the Limpopo bus disaster that killed and injured dozens of Zimbabwean and Malawian nationalsare entitled to lodge claims for compensation  but theres a legal catch that could determine who actually gets paid.\n\nResponding to IOL, the RAF said that while all victims of the tragic DNC Coaches crash near Makhado have the right to apply for compensation under the Road Accident Fund Act, any potential payouts will depend on the outcome of investigations and on each claimants legal status in South Africa.\n\nVictims and/or families of last weeks bus crash in Limpopo are entitled to lodge claims according to the Road Accident Fund Act, [but] each claim will still have to be assessed on its own merit, the RAF told IOL.\n\nIt is not accurate that the RAF is liable for all or any accidents. Before the RAF can be liable, there must be an establishment of the fact that the accident was wrongfully caused.\n\nThe bus, which was travelling from Gqeberha (Port Elizabeth) to Harare, plunged off an embankment near Makhado (Louis Trichardt) on 12 October, killing more than 40 people and leaving many passengers critically injured.\n\nThe vehicle was licensed to carry 61 passengers, but investigators from the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) found that it was carrying more than 90 people, mostly Zimbabweans and Malawians returning home.\n\nThe Zimbabwean government has since stepped in to assist its citizens  pledging to repatriate the remains of those who died, cover hospital costs for the injured, and coordinate with South African authorities. Malawian officials are conducting similar efforts to identify and assist their nationals.\n\nThe RAFs intervention comes amid public speculation that the fund is automatically liable for compensation to foreign nationals injured or killed on South African roads.\n\nHowever, the agencys statement makes clear that liability must first be established under Section 3 of the RAF Act, which stipulates that compensation can only be paid for loss or damage wrongfully caused by the driving of a motor vehicle.\n\nThat means that each claim will have to be individually investigated  including who was at fault, whether the driver or bus company was negligent, and whether the vehicle was legally roadworthy.\n\nUntil the claims are lodged with the RAF, we implore everyone concerned to allow the relevant authorities to conclude their investigations before any pronouncements are made on the liability of the RAF, the Fund told IOL.\n\nThe RAF also introduced a crucial legal caveat that could prevent some victims  particularly those without valid documentation  from receiving compensation.\n\nThe RAF as an organ of state is obliged to comply with section 42 of the Immigration Act, which prohibits the aiding and abetting of illegal foreigners, the Fund said.\n\nWhere the RAFs liability is established, the payment of compensation must not contravene any other law such as the Immigration Act.\n\nIn practice, this means that while foreign nationals are not excluded from lodging claims, undocumented migrants may face legal barriers if their compensation would be deemed to aid or abet an illegal presence in the country.\n\nLegal experts say this clause could become a flashpoint in the coming weeks, as lawyers for victims test whether the RAF can lawfully withhold payments based on immigration status.\n\nDespite its legal caution, the RAF extended condolences to those affected, saying it sympathizes with the families of those injured and deceased in the accident and pledges to support them through the claims process.\n\nThe agency urged survivors and families to make contact through its call centre (087 820 1111), WhatsApp line (071 605 4707), or emailcontactcentre@raf.co.za.\n\nThe Limpopo tragedy has reignited debate about the rights of foreign nationals in South Africa  especially when it comes to access to public compensation funds.\n\nAnti-immigrant groups have criticised the idea of South African taxpayers compensating non-citizens, while rights advocates argue that the RAFs mandate applies to all persons injured or killed on South African roads, regardless of nationality.\n\nThe outcome of the Limpopo case could set an important legal and moral precedent, testing the intersection of immigration law, human rights, and public compensation.\n\nAuthorities from the Road Traffic Management Corporation and Limpopo Transport Departmentare continuing investigations into the crash. Early findings point to excessive speed, overloading, and poor vehicle maintenance as likely contributing factors.\n\nFor now, survivors and families are being advised to gather identity documents, medical records, and accident reports to prepare their claims  a process that could take months to resolve.\n\n",

            "content": "The Conversation\n\nCannabis is booming as an ingredient in everything fromsupplementary oils, inflammation-reducingskin creams, lip balms tohealth drinksand gummy sweets that promise to reduce anxiety and pain and promote relaxation.\n\nThe global legal cannabis market is todayworth aboutUS$69.78 billion, and this will skyrocket toUS$216.76 billion by 2033.\n\nBut is this boom benefiting indigenous cannabis farmers in southern Africa? Theyd been growing the plant for hundreds of years before colonial authorities criminalised it in the early 1900s. Rural people continued to grow it illicitly after that, relying on its medicinal properties.\n\nFor many rural households in southern Africa today, cannabis pays for the familys food,education,and other necessities.\n\nIn South Africa, cannabis wasprohibitedunder different laws since1928. In neighbouring Zimbabwe, theDangerous Drugs Actcriminalised cannabis in 1955, and this continued after independence.\n\nBut in 2018, this changed. South Africas Constitutional Courtdecriminalisedprivate use and limited private cultivation for personal consumption, while Zimbabweregulatedthe cultivation of cannabis for medicinal and industrial purposes.\n\nWe are social scientists who research cannabis and development in Africa. We interviewed a wide range of people, from political leaders to illicit growers to cannabis lobbyists and non-governmental organisations to technical people involved in the industry, such as greenhouse installers. We wanted touncoverthe challenges small-scale cannabis farmers faced after cannabis was decriminalised.\n\nOur researchfoundthat cannabis reform has continued old patterns of unfairness. For example, we found that medicinal cannabis production is currently an exclusive business which only well off businesses can participate in. Farmers who traditionally cultivated cannabis and sold it when it was still illegal have not been included in the new cannabis industry.\n\nIf these problems are not solved, the potential of cannabis to be a tool for development in Zimbabwe and South Africa will remain unfulfilled.\n\nSouth Africas move towards legalisation was not triggered by the government but by the courts. The 2018 Constitutional Court rulingfound thatcriminalising private cannabis use violated the constitutional right to privacy. The state couldnt show a good enough reason to interfere with adults doing private things like smoking cannabis by consent, as long as no one else was being harmed.\n\nThis decision created a ripple effect. It ignited public debate about personal freedoms. It also sparked discussion about whether cannabis could help redress historical injustices, create jobs, and boost economies in rural areas where the plant has long been cultivated.\n\nSince then, however, reform has been slow and uneven. The government passed theCannabis for Private Purposes Act in 2024. This sets out the amounts of cannabis that individuals can possess and grow. However, most commercial trade is in the tightly regulated medical and hemp sectors (hemp beingCannabis sativawith very low levels of THC, the active psychoactive cannabanoid). Trade in cannabis outside these sectors is mainly prohibited.\n\nAlso, small-scale farmers  many of whom have cultivated cannabis for generations  face high barriers to entering the legal market. To set up a medicinal cannabis business in South Africa needs alicencefrom the health products regulatory authority. The cannabis farm has to meet high quality standards, and comply with strict manufacturing and agricultural practices. Cannabis farms are also inspected regularly.\n\nMedicinal cannabis businessesestimatethat R3 million to R5 million (US$173,000 to US$289,000) is needed to start a farm. This high cost sidelines the very communities that kept the cannabis industry going when the plant was banned.\n\nZimbabwes reform took a different route. The government legalised cannabis cultivation in 2018, but only for medicinal and industrial purposes. Recreational use remains illegal.\n\nThe governments motivation was for cannabis to complement tobacco as an important cash crop. Officials projected abillion-dollar industrygeared mainly towards exporting cannabis.\n\nIn practice, though, only wealthy investors can afford to set up cannabis export businesses. For example, a five-year medicinal cannabislicence costsUS$50,000. On top of that, cannabis farmers must paysubstantial annualinspection fees and licence renewal fees.\n\nOur research also found that the cost of greenhouses prevents small-scale farmers from starting cannabis businesses. Medicinal cannabis farmers are required to use greenhouses to control temperatures, humidity, pests and contamination. A greenhouse installer we interviewed said one of their cheaper versions cost US$220,000 for a five-hectare plot.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the main people who have benefited from cannabis law reform have been established local business people andforeign investors. Small-scale cannabis farmers  the backbone of Zimbabwes cannabis trade for decades  remain excluded. Many continue togrow it illicitly. This sustains domestic illegal markets and means these small farmers dont benefit from the promised green gold.\n\nIn both countries, corporate capture of the cannabis industry is looming. Well-capitalised companies, often with international backing, are able to afford the costs of meeting regulatory standards. They also have the funds to sell cannabis on the export market. If the cannabis industry is taken over by corporations, profits will be concentrated in a narrow elite rather than growers on the ground.\n\nBoth countries are also struggling with the contradiction between reforming cannabis laws and international drug controls which still classify cannabis as a prohibited substance. This complicates efforts to develop export markets and creates uncertainty for investors.\n\nExcluding smallholder farmers whove farmed cannabis for decades perpetuates inequality. It also undermines the sustainability of reform, because illicit markets will continue to thrive if ordinary cultivators see no benefit in moving to the legal sector. More inclusive models are possible. These could include tiered licensing systems with lower fees for small-scale farmers.\n\nCannabis producer co-operatives can also enable their participation, as is the casein Morocco.\n\nCommunities and commercial investors should partner to strengthen one another. They can form joint ventures where communities provide labour and knowledge of local climatic conditions and cannabis varieties while investors provide funds and ensure regulatory compliance.\n\nThese ventures would recognise the contribution of traditional cultivators while still ensuring cannabis quality and safety in the legal market.\n\nThe next phase of reform in both countries must focus on including small-scale farmers. Laws must be passed to balance the commercial opportunities that come from selling cannabis with the rights and livelihoods of small-scale cultivators.\n\nSenior research associate, Centre of Criminology, University of Cape Town\n\nTeaching Associate, School of Social Sciences, Cardiff University\n\nThis article was originally published inThe Conversation.\n\n",

Despite several capital-raising efforts earlier in 2025, the company still faces a funding gap needed to complete the next phase of development at its Zulu project.\n\nThe failure to secure this additional funding could significantly impact both the Zulu Lithium Project and the overall financial health of the company, Premier said in a Regulatory News Service (RNS) announcement issued on October 21.\n\nAt an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM), shareholders will vote on whether to approve a discounted open offer as the primary means of raising the required capital. However, Premier cautioned that it cannot guarantee the offer will be fully subscribed or that alternative financing options will be available on favourable terms.\n\nSince launching the project in 2023, Premier has made notable progress, including the establishment of a lithium concentrate production plant. However, it missed its target to ship the first spodumene concentrate to Canmax Technologies by March 2023, leading the company to declare force majeure. Canmax, which had provided US$35 million in financing for the plant, contested the declaration, but the two later reached a settlement.\n\nThe project has continued to face challenges during its fourth production phase, primarily due to funding constraints that have affected maintenance and procurement of essential spare parts.\n\nPremier now requires US$6.2 million to complete pre-production preparations and advance the project to full commercial production.\n\nShareholder support for the upcoming resolutions is of utmost importance to avoid jeopardising the future of the Zulu Project and the companys financial viability, the company said.\n\nThe Zulu Lithium and Tantalum Project forms part of Premiers broader strategy to capitalise on surging global demand for lithium,a key mineral used in rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), smartphones, laptops, and renewable energy storage systems.\n\n",

It must have been very clear to you I was intensely unwell.\n\nShe added: I felt ashamed, unclean and embarrassed.\n\nBut with my improved strength and sense of self worth a feeling of clarity arrived  it was not my fault or responsibility, it was wholly yours.\n\nJudge Richard Kelly told Ncube he had shown a warped sense of responsibility by suggesting the victim initiated the conduct.\n\nNcube, previously of good character, was sentenced to four years and nine months imprisonment.\n\nHe expressed remorse through his barrister, who said he felt nothing but shame and guilt for his actions.\n\n",
