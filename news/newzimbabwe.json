The song delves into his personal battles and the demons of poverty.\n\nThe new release, a blend of three great musical voices, celebrates the hardships of ZvirimoMumoyothose whose dreams are manifesting, albeit at a slow pace.\n\nThe songs visuals depict a young man in the high-density suburbs who, despite the hardships, is driven by ambition.\n\nThe protagonist is a reflection of Master H himself, who endured hurdles such as drug abuse and a lack of opportunity before making his breakthrough in the music scene.\n\nThe song resonates with the majority of young people who navigate a life born out of hardship and struggle. The ghetto setting paves the way for Ghetto Tears.\n\nGhetto Tears portrays hardship once again, with strife at the core of its message. It offers a raw and introspective perspective on the lives of young people.\n\nMaster H, himself a product of the ghetto, has taken it upon himself to be the voice of striving young people. He interrogatespoverty that is rife in the ghetto which has seen many failing to acquire basics.\n\nThe intertwining themes of the three songs, each carrying a deeper meaning, are a testament to Master Hs lyrical prowess.\n\nAnchored in hardship, the three tracks carry a message of hope despite the struggles.\n\nOverall, the EP showcases Master Hs versatility as an artist, blending his signature party anthems with deeper, more reflective narratives.\n\n",

Similarly, products like insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides  essential for improving crop yields, saw imports of US$296 million within African markets in 2023.\n\nThe global and regional agricultural sectors are expanding, and the demand for agrochemicals continues to rise, presenting Zimbabwe with a unique opportunity to tap into these markets and drive export-led growth.\n\nCloser to home, ZimTrade said the demand for fertilizers and crop protection products is growing across Southern Africa due to the regions reliance on agriculture as a key economic activity with the potential for export growth being high particularly in countries such as Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique, which are all experiencing an increase in agricultural activity.\n\nAs demand for fertilizers and crop protection products increases in these countries, Zimbabwean companies are well-positioned to capitalize on this growth by offering cost-effective solutions that cater to the specific agricultural needs of each market, the agency added.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nGEO Pomona, a private company awarded the mandate to oversee waste management in Harare, is yet to begin its operations, with residential areas accumulating uncollected garbage.\n\nFollowing pressure from the Ministry of Local Government, the Harare City Council entered into an agreement last year with GEO Pomona Waste Management, allowing the company to collect 650 tonnes of refuse daily at a rate of US$40 per tonne.\n\nHowever, two months into the year, piles of garbage remain a common sight in Harare, with some areas going for weeks without refuse collection, leading to the rise of illegal dumping sites.\n\nThe Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) director, Reuben Akili, says the deal was designed to benefit top officials without considering residents input.\n\nAs CHRA, we have always maintained that the GEO Pomona project has nothing to do with refuse collection or improving waste management in the city. As you can see, those who championed this dubious project now have egg on their faces, as it is clear this initiative will fail. It has nothing to do with service provision but is rather a scheme to dig deeper into the pockets of local authorities.\n\nUnfortunately, it has become expensive for them to collect waste and dump it at Pomona because the dump site has been privatised under dubious circumstances, in a manner that is both fictitious and clandestine, Akili told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nThe Harare City Council succumbed to government pressure after initially opposing the takeover by GEO Pomona, which is led by controversial businessman Delish Nguwaya.\n\nGEO Pomona was established in 2022 after a Dutch waste management firm, Geogenix BV, secured a US$350 million waste-to-energy deal with the city.\n\nGEO Pomonas operations with the City of Harare have been a source of contention among residents.\n\nWhen approached for comment, GEO Pomonas public relations officer, Siphathisiwe Masuku, told NewZimbabwe.com that the delay in implementing the deal was due to a transitional process.\n\nWe recognise the challenges of waste collection and fully acknowledge the significant responsibility entrusted to us. Currently, we are in a transitional period and are finalising key logistics. Our goal is to establish an efficient and sustainable waste management system that serves the city effectively. Achieving this requires careful planning, coordination, and preparation.\n\nDuring this transition period, the City of Harare continues to handle door-to-door waste collection while we work closely with them to finalise key logistics. This includes defining operational zones, identifying transfer points, and securing garages for vehicle servicing and parking.\n\nAdditionally, we are actively engaging with the City of Harare on the transfer of employees, as we are committed to retaining experienced personnel who bring valuable expertise. Once everything has been finalised, we will announce the official launch date, said Masuku.\n\n",

Of the deceased, six were minors.\n\nWhile the risk level has generally reduced  I regret to inform this house that we have lost one more person yesterday evening, bringing to nine the total number of fatalities to date.

Another positive note is that our critical infrastructure remain[s] stable, with both electricity and water supply fully restored. Our 24-hour clinics, primary hospitals, and referral hospitals are operational and accessible to all, although there may be occasional interruptions in service provision.\n\nWhile the situation is improving with rain subsiding, more than 600 people remained at evacuation centers Monday.\n\nCalvin Moalosi, a Gaborone resident who was at one of the centers, said he lost his belongings due to the floods.\n\nI have never seen so much water in my life. The house became a pool of water, and it is really sad that some people were swept away in the floods, Moalosi said. The government has done its best to evacuate people and take them to safe areas.\n\nMost parts of the country recorded heavy rains from 150 mm (6 inches) to 200 mm (8 inches) in a 24-hour period several times last week.\n\nKutlwano Mukokomani, chief executive at the local Red Cross Society, said the organization is continuing to provide relief at evacuation centers across the country.\n\nThe Botswana Red Cross Society provided relief items to evacuation centers. We continue to provide these relief items to ensure that our communities are kept safe. We provided food items, blankets, mattresses and also hygiene packs. We are also doing assessments so that they can further guide our response, Mukokomani said.\n\nBotswana, like most southern African countries, has been recovering from the devastating El Nino-induced drought.\n\n",

You would find that there are running battles between the police and commuter omnibus operators.\n\nThe police will be targeting commuter omnibuses and when commuter omnibuses are offloading people, the rank marshals tip them off and they try to evade the police. You would find that passengers get hurt and some are affected by that Hon. Speaker, this is not sustainable, said Chikomo.\n\nThe Glen View legislator added that punitive measures should be taken to address the cat-and-mouse game between commuter omnibuses and the ZRP.\n\nAs a nation, I think we need to enact laws which will help in this situation because now people are no longer free because of the races between the commuter omnibus and the police, said Chikomo.\n\nZRP officers have been involved in running battles with commuter omnibuses and pirate taxis. These confrontations have resulted in the loss of innocent passengers lives.\n\nHowever, in a surprising response, the Speaker of Parliament, Jacob Mudenda, dismissed Chikomos concerns.\n\nIf they are not guilty, why do they run away? Do innocent people run away? If a car is stationary and the driver is in the car, when the police come, why do people run away when they are innocent? So, inform combi drivers to drive their vehicles accordingly. There is no need to run away, said Mudenda.\n\nCommuter omnibuses remain a preferred mode of transport, despite some operating outside the parameters of the law.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) has expressed doubts over the fiscal authorities capability to attain a 3% month-on-month inflation rate by year-end.\n\nPresenting the 2025 National Budget, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube, projected annual inflation rate for Zimbabwe in 2025 is expected to bewithin single digits on the strength of stable month-on-month inflation below 3% based on tight fiscal and monetary policies;essentially indicating a significantly lower inflation rate compared to previous years.\n\nHowever, the latest CZI inflation tracker doubts the possibility of attaining the set inflation target.\n\nThe high inflation rate for January 2025 threatens to make it difficult for this to be realised. The elevated ZWG month-on-month inflation rate poses a significant challenge to achieving a low annual ZWG inflation rate by May 2025, when the annual inflation figure will be reported, the industry lobby group said.\n\nIn January 2025,CZI saidthere was an observed decline in the parallel market premium as ZWG depreciated faster in the parallel market compared to the official market.\n\nThe ZWG depreciated on both the official and the parallel market by about 4,8% and 0,6% respectively between the period 1st of October 2024 to 29th of January 2025.\n\nAs a result, the exchange rate premium also declined from 38% on the 1st of October to 34% on the 29th of January 2025.\n\nThe tight liquidity stance which has seen the scarcity of ZWG has helped create some stability of the exchange rate. However, the value of 34% is still high as it creates access challenges to US$ for compliant retailers and encourages arbitrage opportunities, the inflation tracker added.\n\n",
