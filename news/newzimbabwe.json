First game in the league. You start that with a win. You can not ask for much. What is important for us is we have taken off.\n\nI must admit it was difficult, and we always knew it was going to be difficult.

Any interpretation to the contrary is incorrect. Accordingly, the release of the accused will put the nation in unrest and undermine peace and security. In the circumstances, it is the courts finding that the state has managed to give compelling reasons justifying the continued detention of the accused person. Accordingly, bail is denied.\n\nWhat is an issue is not that applicant gathered and disseminated information. It is that information which he gathered which was intended to incite public violence, the magistrate said.\n\nThe admission to bail has been elevated to a constitutional right. But our Constitution is not novel. The onus is on the court to determine the bail.\n\nAn arrested person is entitled to be released unconditionally, it is only when there are compelling reasons an accused can be denied bail.\n\nThe court will need to weigh the reasons for granting and denying bail and weigh. In exercising this discretion, the court should put in balance the interests of the accused person and also not put administration in danger.\n\nHe said, It is a delicate discretion.\n\nGwatima added that the likelihood that an accused will abscond or interfere with investigations should be strongly supported.\n\nTurning to the present application, it is my considered view that grounds 3, 4, and 5his position at work, if granted bail, he is likely to interfere. Of critical importance, some of the witnesses have not been recorded hence, his release will jeopardise investigations.\n\n",

There, she recalled, the two statesmen enjoyed fishing together.\n\nThey were very close. It was beautiful . . . So when I heard about the passing on of our dear friend, the president, I said I would present myself in person to offer my condolences. I couldnt just stay in Zimbabwe and not come to commiserate with you, because of the relations we had and, specifically, the relationship he had with my husband, Grace told Kovambo while comforting her.\n\nGrace also shared that she knew Nujoma before he became Namibias founding president, as he visited her husband a lot.\n\nRELATED: Namibias founding father Sam Nujoma dies aged 95\n\nI knew President Nujoma even before he was president. When he was still fighting for the independence of the country, he used to visit my husband a lot. I would see them having conversations regarding what he wanted to see happen in Namibia, the commitment, the relentless fighting for what he thought was supposed to be the Namibia he wanted. He did it with so much love for the people of this country and when Namibia became independent, I was so happy because I saw him. I had experienced what he wanted for this country. I am happy that he was able to see all he wished for, Grace said.\n\nShe also praised Kovambos support for Nujoma, whom she described as a principled leader, noting the late icons achievements were made possible by her care and support.\n\nIm very happy to see you, Mama, I want to be like you, to live long like you. You are a source of inspiration, Mama. I also want to take this opportunity to thank you for looking after [your husband], you did a great job  because without you, he wouldnt have accomplished a lot of things he accomplished in Namibia, in Africa and beyond. It was all because of your support, Mama, Grace said.\n\n",

It is something that needs to be discussed between our company and the government, said Nico Muller, CEO of Implats.\n\nIt is something that is on the agenda for us to have a discussion with the finance minister [Mthuli Ncube] as well as the principle [Mnangagwe]. It is not something I want to scrub under the carpet.\n\nImplats 85% owned Zimplats borrowed money in order to pay for capital goods because the cash it was receiving from the dollar receipts fell short, said Meroonisha Kerber, Implats CFO in a presentation of the firms interim results on Thursday.\n\nFrom an efficiency point of view it makes sense to borrow there [in Zimbabwe] as well as from a discipline perspective because, as we have said, all our operations have to fund all of their own capital, she said.\n\nImplats said earlier today that it was assessing its portfolio in the event that poor platinum group metal prices persisted. Muller identified the firms Canadian mine Lac des Iles (Impala Canada) and Marula as the most vulnerable assets.\n\nLac des Iles would be run down as the firm had last year targeted its high margin ounces, reducing its reserve life. Regarding Marula, a decision has to be made in two years regarding a second phase expansion which would access up to 24 years of reserves. It first, however, had to become cash flow positive, said Muller.\n\nMuller said most of the cost cuts, including job losses, had been done with little now to reduce in overall corporate overheads. We are now at portfolio decisions, he said. There were several shafts in the firms flagship Rustenburg division that were also sailing close to the wind, he told media earlier in the day.\n\nImplats has invested heavily in the processing capacity of its Zimplats. Said Muller: We have always been positive about our investment orientation with regards to Zimbabwe. We do believe the Great Dyke offers the best available resource out there.\n\nWe have had a very constructive, healthy, long-standing relationship with the government and that has not necessarily changed.\n\n",

The infrastructure has been established featuring extra wide detour lanes designated as Express Lanes. To use the express lane, vehicles must be equipped with an e-tag which will be scanned by the system. Once detected, the boom banner will automatically open.\n\nPlease note that express lanes will not have a cashier on duty. In line with this, the ZINARA team will visit the new Parliament Building on the 26th of February and 5th March 2025 from 0900 hours to 1600 hours for the installation of the e-tags.\n\nAll Members of Parliament are encouraged to bring their two exempted vehicles along with their registration books for this installation exercise. Kindly note that failure to have electronic tags installed on exempt vehicles may cause significant inconvenience when passing through the tollgates. For more information, please visit Human Capital Department in office No. 340, said Mudenda.\n\nThe leader of the opposition Labour, Economists and African Democrats (LEAD) Linda Masarira rubbished the new benefits for MPs, saying they already have enough benefits.\n\nThe recent revelation that Zimbabwean Members of Parliament (MPs) and Senators now enjoy free tollgate passage, free parking, and the registration of two vehicles exempt from toll fees is yet another blatant display of elite privilege in a country where millions struggle to afford basic necessities. This new perk, added to their long list of extravagant benefits, is a direct insult to the suffering masses.\n\nWhile ordinary Zimbabweans are burdened with high transport costs, poor wages, and relentless economic hardships, our lawmakers continue to prioritize their own comfort over the needs of the people who elected them, said Masarira on X.\n\n",

            "content": "Xinhua\n\nWith her vision restored after a successful cataract surgery, 80-year-old Mariya Sangare beamed with joy as she prepared to embrace a new chapter in life, thanks to a team of Chinese doctors.\n\nI can now see everything clearly. There is nothing I cannot see, Sangare said at the official launch of the Bright Journey program on Wednesday at the Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe.\n\nSangare is one of 600 Zimbabwean patients benefiting from the China-aided program, which provides free cataract surgeries.\n\nA team of 12 specialists from Chinas Hunan Provincial Peoples Hospital has been carrying out the surgeries under the program, which began on Feb. 12. The Chinese doctors are highly skilled, and we are very happy, Sangare said.\n\nFor patients like Sangare, whose lives were hindered by blurred vision, the initiative offers a renewed sense of independence and hope.\n\nThis initiative has helped me a lot. My grandchildren can now eat peanut butter from the peanuts I grow. I could not farm this year because of my cataracts, she said.\n\nCosmas Chipengo, a 25-year-old recipient of the surgery, said restoring his eyesight means he can now return to work after seven months.\n\nI want to thank the Chinese doctors because we could not afford the medical expenses. This program has done a great thing for us, he told Xinhua.\n\nZimbabwean Minister of Health and Child Care Douglas Mombeshora said that preventable blindness from cataracts remains a major public health issue in the country, but the Bright Journey program is helping address the challenge.\n\nThis moment represents not merely the commencement of a medical project, but the beginning of a bright journey, an important initiative that seeks to restore sight to 600 Zimbabweans, empowering them to reclaim their autonomy and reintegrate fully into society, Mombeshora said.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, an estimated 125,000 people in Zimbabwe were living with blindness in 2021, with 62,500 cases caused by cataracts. Due to the high cost of treatment, many low-income individuals, particularly in rural areas, are unable to access care, leading to preventable blindness.\n\nSpeaking at the launch, Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Zhou Ding said that the program not only reflects Chinas commitment to global health cooperation but also strengthens the deep and enduring friendship between China and Zimbabwe.\n\nThis year marks both the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Zimbabwe and the 40th anniversary of their medical cooperation.\n\nWith the launch of this program, we add another milestone to our anniversary celebrations, Zhou said.\n\nThe impact of the program extends beyond restoring sight as it enhances Zimbabwes medical expertise in eye surgeries and fosters knowledge exchange between Chinese and Zimbabwean medical professionals, the ambassador added.\n\n",
