The potential buyer of the land, believed to be Collins Mnangagwa, is constructing a multi-storey building in the area and intends to close part of the public road.\n\nThe residents have been given a month to lodge objections and reasons with the City Council regarding the land.\n\nThe Highlands Residents Association has, via a petition, objected to the sale of the portion of the road by the City Council.\n\nWe, the undersigned residents and community members of Highlands and surrounding areas, hereby submit our formal objection to the proposed permanent road closure of a portion of Otto Road (i.e. Otto Drive, being the road connecting Willowmead Lane to Collins Avenue hereinafter referred to as Otto Road as per the public notice), Highlands, Harare, as advertised in the Public Notice placed in The Herald on Tuesday 2 September 2025, read the petition.\n\nThe residents lashed out at the City Council for the lack of transparency in the process, arguing that the sale of the land deprives the public of the benefits it carries.\n\nOtto Road is public land. Its permanent closure and subsequent sale would deprive current and future residents of their right to access and benefit from public infrastructure.\n\nOtto Road provides a safe and established route for domestic workers, security guards, gardeners, pedestrians, cyclists, schoolchildren, walkers and joggers. Closing it will force vulnerable users onto busier, more dangerous routes.\n\nMany people who rely on Otto Road do not own cars. Closure would disproportionately harm women, children, and low-income workers who depend on safe non-motorised routes.\n\nThe proposed closure appears to serve private interests at the expense of the broader community. Council has a duty to uphold transparency and protect public assets for collective benefit, read the petition.\n\n",

Something must have gone seriously wrong.\n\nOnias argued the property was a donation that could be revoked because Pride had become disrespectful and violent towards him, and had even tried to sell it against his wishes.\n\nBut the court ruled there was never a valid donation. There was never an intention to gratuitously and without obligation give the 1st respondent the property, Justice Muzofa said. There were strings attached. The applicant intended to continue to derive a benefit from the property.\n\nThe judge stressed that while Onias funded the purchase, the house was always registered in Prides name. The evidence before the Court strongly shows that the applicant purchased the property for the 1st respondent and he had strings attached, the judge said.\n\nDismissing the claim with costs, the judge concluded: Revocation can only be made where there is a valid donation.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court of Zimbabwe has dismissed a bid by Emmanuel Dumbu to overturn the appointment of Matubede Mudavanhu as Chief Mugabe, ruling that the succession dispute had reached a stalemate that justified presidential intervention.\n\nDumbu had cited President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Local Government minister and Mudavanhu as respondents.\n\nDumbu had argued that his rivals appointment was irregular, illegitimate and unconstitutional, claiming he was the rightful heir under the Mugabe clans collateral system of rotation. He maintained that a 2022 meeting of the five royal houses had nominated him as the successor.\n\nBut Justice Herbert Zisengwe, sitting at the Masvingo High Court, said the appointment of Mudavanhu was valid, stressing that the traditional process had failed to produce consensus. There was a stalemate and this effectively left the Minister with no option but to invoke the proviso to section 3(2) of the Traditional Leaders Act, the judge ruled.\n\nThe court noted that Mudavanhu had already served as acting chief since 2009, adding: His appointment cannot be said to be inimical to the customs, traditions and culture of the community in question.\n\nOn the disputed 2022 Chikarudzo meeting, which Dumbu relied on, the judge was blunt: It would be an exercise in futility to repeat the same process and expect a different result.\n\nJustice Zisengwe also warned that Zimbabwes laws must provide a mechanism to end deadlocks in future disputes: Such a provision is a necessary tie breaker; a necessary tool to break any possible impasse.\n\nThe court dismissed Dumbus application with costs, cementing Mudavanhus position as substantive Chief Mugabe after nearly 14 years in an acting role.\n\nArguing his case,Dumbu said he is the legitimate heir to the throne.\n\nHe alleged that the appointment of Mudavanhu flouted what he termed the Mugabe chieftainships collateral system of rotation among the five houses, each with a right to the throne at any given time.\n\nThese houses are the Dumbu, Chipfunhu, Haruzivishe, Chikamhi (Muzondo) and Mudavanhu houses.\n\nAccording to him, the houses take turns in succeeding to the throne in order of seniority.\n\nThe term house is customary parlance for family. In short, the eldest child (usually the eldest son) of the founder of the clan is considered the most senior and basically establishes the most senior house.\n\nEach of his brothers established the second house and subsequent houses in order of seniority.\n\nWhat the collateral system of rotation envisages, therefore, is that the eldest member of the first family succeeds his father.\n\nUpon his death, his most senior brother takes over, followed by the third and so on.\n\nThis cycle is repeated with each successive generation.\n\nDumbu said Musavanhu was irregularly appointed after he had served about 13 years as an acting chief following the demise of one Mute Mudavanhu of the Mudavanhu house.\n\nHe further asserts that the incessant complaints raised by the affected people over the prolonged tenure of the third respondent as acting chief initially went unheeded but eventually the Provincial Assembly of Chiefs seconded three chiefs from the province (namely Chief Nhema, Chitanga and Serima) to resolve the matter.\n\nThis culminated in a meeting held on 31 October 2022 at a creche at Chikarudzo Business Centre, dubbed the Chikarudzo meeting. This meeting was convened to deliberate over the appointment of substantive Chief Mugabe.\n\nMost importantly, the applicant avers that at that meeting all five houses were represented and it was agreed that the Dumbu house, to which he belongs, was to succeed the Mudavanhu house. When the Dumbu house was requested to name the person to take up the throne, he was identified as the one to do so.\n\nAccording to him, therefore, he was duly nominated as the heir to the throne.\n\nTo his dismay, however, he learnt on 13 February 2023 that Mudavanhu had been appointed Chief Mugabe.\n\n",
