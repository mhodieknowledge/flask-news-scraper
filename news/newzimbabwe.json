            "content": "BBC\n\nOscar-winning US actor Gene Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa, and their dog have been found dead at their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\nIn a wide-ranging career spanning more than six decades, Hackman won two Academy Awards for his work on The French Connection and Unforgiven.\n\nA statement from the Santa Fe County Sheriff in New Mexico said: We can confirm that both Gene Hackman and his wife were found deceased Wednesday afternoon at their residence on Sunset Trail.\n\nThis is an active investigation  however, at this time we do not believe that foul play was a factor.\n\nHackman was 95, and his wife  a classical pianist  63.\n\nHe won the best actor Oscar for his role as Jimmy Popeye Doyle in William Friedkins 1971 thriller The French Connection, and another for best supporting actor for playing Little Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwoods Western film Unforgiven in 1992.\n\nA relative latecomer to Hollywood, Hackmans breathrough came in his thirties, when he was nominated for an Oscar for portraying Buck Barrow in 1967s Bonnie and Clyde  opposite Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway  and again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970.\n\nBoth films saw him recognised in the supporting actor category. He was also nominated for best leading actor in 1988 for playing the agent in Mississippi Burning.\n\nThe Santa Fe County Sheriffs office said: On 26 February, 2025, at approximately 1:45pm, Santa Fe County Sheriffs deputies were dispatched to an address on Old Sunset Trail in Hyde Park where Gene Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa, and a dog were found deceased.\n\nMuch-celebrated actor Hackman played more than 100 roles in total, including supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s.\n\nHackman acted opposite many Hollywood heavyweights including Al Pacino in 1973s Scarecrow, Gene Wilder in 1974s Young Frankenstein and Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton in 1981s Reds.\n\nHe also starred in the hit movies Runaway Jury, Wes Andersons The Royal Tenenbaums and Francis Ford Coppolas The Conversation.\n\nCoppola led the tributes to the late star on Thursday, calling him a great artist.In a statement posted on Instagram,the director wrote: Gene Hackman a great actor, inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity. I mourn his loss, and celebrate his existence and contribution.\n\nValerie Perrine, who featured alongside Hackman in Superman (1978) as his characters on-screen girlfriend Eve Teschmacher, described the late actor as a genius and one of the greatest to grace the silver screen.\n\nShe posted on X: His performances are legendary. His talent will be missed. Goodbye my sweet Lex Till we meet again.\n\nStar Trek actorGeorge Takei postedthat we have lost one of the true giants of the screen.\n\nGene Hackman could play anyone, and you could feel a whole life behind it, he wrote. He could be everyone and no one, a towering presence or an everyday Joe. Thats how powerful an actor he was. He will be missed, but his work will live on forever.\n\nSlumdog Millionaire star Anil Kapoor also called Hackman a genius performer. A true legend whose legacy will live on,he wrote.\n\nAs well as his Oscar wins, Hackman also collected two Baftas, four Golden Globes and a Screen Actors Guild Award.\n\nHe took a comedic turn playing a conservative senator in 1996s The Birdcage alongside Robin Williams and Nathan Lane, who starred as a gay couple.\n\nHis last big-screen appearance came as Monroe Cole in Welcome to Mooseport in 2004, after which he stepped back from Hollywood for a quieter life in New Mexico.\n\nBorn in California in 1930, Hackmans family moved frequently, and after lying about his age at 16, he enlisted in the US Marine Corps serving for four-and-a-half years.\n\nHe was stationed in China, Hawaii and Japan before being discharged in 1951.\n\nFollowing his military service, Hackman lived and worked in a variety jobs in New York, and studied journalism and television production at the University of Illinois, before deciding to drop out and move back to California to pursue his childhood acting dream.\n\nHe joined the Pasadena Playhouse in California, where he befriended a young Dustin Hoffman.\n\nI suppose I wanted to be an actor from the time I was about 10, maybe even younger than that, Hackman once said. Recollections of early movies that I had seen and actors that I admired like James Cagney, Errol Flynn, those kind of romantic action guys.\n\nWhen I saw those actors, I felt I could do that. But I was in New York for about eight years before I had a job. I sold ladies shoes, polished leather furniture, drove a truck.\n\nI think that if you have it in you and you want it bad enough, you can do it.\n\nHe added that he wanted to act but had always been convinced that actors had to be handsome.\n\nThat came from the days when Errol Flynn was my idol. Id come out of a theatre and be startled when I looked in a mirror because I didnt look like Flynn. I felt like him.\n\nHackman moved back to New York in 1963, performing in Off-Broadway productions  including at the Music Box Theatre for the comedy Any Wednesday  and smaller TV roles.\n\nBut he began to really make his name in the 1970s, becoming a leading man as New York City detective Jimmy Popeye Doyle in The French Connection.\n\nFrom then on he became a fixture on the big screen in the likes of 1972 disaster film The Poseidon Adventure.\n\nHe also appeared in Children From Their Games at the former Morosco Theatre, Poor Richard at Helen Hayes Theatre and The Natural Look at Longacre Theatre, before later returning in 1992 to perform Death And The Maiden at the Brooks Atkinson Theatre.\n\nHackman and his first wife, Faye Maltese, were together for 30 years and raised three children before getting divorced in 1986.\n\nIn his later years, he and his second wife, Betsy stayed out of the spotlight, but made a rare public appearance together at the 2003 Golden Globe Awards, where he won the Cecil B. deMille award.\n\nIn 2008 he told Reuters that despite the lack of any official announcement, he was not going to act any longer.\n\nIve been told not to say that over the last few years, in case some real wonderful part comes up, but I really dont want to do it any longer.\n\nHe also explained he was focusing his attentions away from the big screen and towards his quieter, calmer passion for writing novels.\n\nI was trained to be an actor, not a star. I was trained to play roles, not to deal with fame and agents and lawyers and the press, he once said.\n\nIt really costs me a lot emotionally to watch myself on-screen. I think of myself, and feel like Im quite young, and then I look at this old man with the baggy chins and the tired eyes and the receding hairline and all that.\n\n",

The purpose of her visit was to collect the cash for her course, Manjore said.\n\nShe has since quit her job in Greendale so she can focus on finding her missing daughter.\n\nMercy Morlean has been missing for over a month now.\n\nI then asked to use my daughters phone since my phones battery had died.While I was using the phone, I saw messages received from a boy. It was around 9 pm and she was already sleeping, she added.\n\nManjore says she reprimanded Mercy the following morning before leaving for work adding that she had barred her from interacting with the same boy in the past and had even asked school authorities to intervene in the matter.\n\nWhen she returned home for lunch she summoned Mercy who then left and has not been seen since.\n\nAt lunchtime, I came back again and told her that I needed to sit down and talk to her, I assume she thought I wanted to beat her and she just left the house without saying anything. She was not even wearing shoes, and had no money, the distraught mother added.\n\nMercy was last seen wearing a blue top, jacket, and floral skirt. Her hair was plaited with black and maroon braids.\n\nLillian has tried all possible ways of looking for her daughter by going to the police station but they havent found her yet.\n\nManjore has filed a missing persons report with the police and has looked for her daughter at shopping centres, and enquired with her friends and even prophets but with no luck.\n\nShe pleaded, Iam kindly appealing for assistance in locating my daughter. If she sees this news coverage I want her to know that I did not reprimand her because I hate her but because I care and love her.\n\n",

This has been attributed to improved miningquality across the mines and increased tonnage from higher-grade zonesat Rukodzi and Bimha mines.\n\nLower-than-planned concentrator production, increase in furnace lockup and the delayed commissioning of the expanded smelter converters impacted 6E production, which decreased by 15% to 279 890 ounces from 327 810 ounces.

This was caused bya 13% decline in sales volumes to 279 740 6Eouncesas average metal prices were 8% higherfor the period.\n\nMoreover, cost of sales decreased by 6% to $323m on the lower sales volumes, partly offset by a 7%increase in costs to $885 per 6E ounce produced.\n\nConsequently, profit before income tax was 37% lower at $8.9m after an income tax charge of $4.7m for the half year,\n\nInterim post tax profits in Zimplatsimproved to$4.1m compared toa loss of $8.8m in the previous contrasting period, although there was no dividend declared for the period.\n\nZimplatsaccessed borrowings of US$4.5m during the half year andclosed the period with cash and cash equivalents of$41.4m .\n\nThe development and upgrade of Mupani Mine which will replace Ngwarati, Rukodzi and part of Mupfuti mines that are depleting remains on schedule, with full production of 3.6 million tonnes per annum planned for the first half of 2029.\n\nZimplats has spend a cumulative$339mas at 31 December 2024 against an approved project budgetof $386m on Mupani mine development.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nSouth Africa  The Free Market Foundation (FMF) has said that the Democratic Alliance (DA) had only one role to play regarding the new Expropriation Act, which is unconditional and unrelenting opposition, but with the formation of the GNU, FMF said the party has allowed itself to be ideologically co-opted and has betrayed liberals.\n\nMartin van Staden, Head of Policy at the FMF, said in a statement issued on Tuesday that the DA has charted a different course, skirting around the acts fundamental constitutional, economic, and moral deficiencies and focusing instead on some peripheral formalities.\n\nThis is a weak  and failed  attempt to show its constituency that it is still againstthe Expropriation Actwhile protecting its position in the government of national unity (GNU).\n\nLiberalisms value proposition is simple: individuals and communities  society  must chart their course. The state must secure society against coercion directed at people or their property. Beyond this, the state must be severely limited by constitutional law so it cannot utilise its incredible power to deprive society of civil liberty or property.\n\nSince the establishment of the Progressive Party in 1959, followed by the Progressive Reform Party, Progressive Federal Party, the Democratic Party, and finally the DA, the DA has been the foremost representative of this political ideology in SA. However, with the formation of the GNU, the party has allowed itself to be ideologically co-opted.\n\nVan Staden added that co-option does not always mean sharing the precise philosophical imperatives of the co-opted,arguing that the DA is not yet a Marxist-Leninist party such as the ANC.\n\nUS President Donald Trump, in his usual unrefined fashion, did SA an excellent service by speaking out in favour of property ownership. He pointed out that property confiscation is now law in SA, that a class of people in SA  property owners  is being badly mistreated, and that this amounts to a human rights violation. On all counts, like him or not, Trump is right.\n\nAnd yet the DA, among the regimes usual cheerleaders in the media and academia, felt compelled to condemn Trump for speaking the truth rather than condemn Parliament and President Cyril Ramaphosa for adopting the kinds of policies that have turned relatively prosperous societies such as Zimbabwe and Venezuela into humanitarian disasters and basket cases, he said.\n\nThe FMF said the DA has been advised repeatedly and in excruciating detail about the constitutional and constitutionalist errors in the Expropriation Act.\n\nTruthfully, this should have been the final red line for the GNU\n\nIt is a betrayal that liberals and those who understand the key role property rights play in safeguarding freedom and democracy and creating the conditions for prosperity should not soon forgive the party for.The DA was supposed to be part of the solution, not part of the problem, read the FMF statement.\n\nApproached for comment, the DA dismissed the FMF statement alleging the party has been co-opted by the ANC and betrayed its supporters on the Expropriation Act.\n\nThe partys national spokesperson, Karabo Khakhau, said she is unsure what informed the FMF statement before dismissing it as baseless.\n\nAnyone with their finger on the pulse of South African politics would know that the DA has submitted court papers challenging the Act.\n\nWe are fundamentally opposed to the Act, in principle, because it opens the door to potential abuse through expropriation without compensation, which threatens property rights.

The Death Penalty Abolition Act [Chapter 9:26] outlawed the imposition of the Death Penalty.\n\nIt further placed a positive legal obligation on the Minister responsible for Justice, the Prosecutor General and the Commissioner General of Prisons to do everything within their respective competencies to ensure every prisoner under the sentence of death is brought before the High Court for resentencing, Mabiza told the gathering.\n\nMaxime Prevot, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, European Affairs and Development Cooperation, speaking on behalf of the core group on the question of the death penalty (Belgium, Benin, Costa Rica, France, Mexico, Mongolia, Republic of Moldova, and Switzerland), hailed the recent decision of Zimbabwe to abolish the death penalty and encouraged other states to follow suit, or, pending its abolition, to impose a moratorium on its use.\n\nSwitzerland welcomed Mabizas presence at the Human Rights Council and congratulated Zimbabwe for the major step in the protection of human rights.\n\nThe High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Trk observed that 113 countries have abolished the death penalty completely. He commended the Zimbabwean government for joining 26 other countries in Africa that have abolished the death penalty.\n\n",
