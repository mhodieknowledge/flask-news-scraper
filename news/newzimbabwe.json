If it means changing the Constitution, only a referendum can decide and even then, the sitting President cannot benefit. Zimbabwe is ruled by law, not party resolutions\n\nTendai Biti also gave his thoughts promising a vicious fight to to deal with corrupt cartels and defend the Constitution\n\nOpposition activist and lawyer Tendai Biti\n\nOur mandate is short and brief. We will defend the Constitution against its capture & manipulation to advance a dangerous unconstitutional anti-people agenda.\n\nWe will fight corrupt cartels and syndicates that have systematically looted Zimbabwe and now want to take over the State, Biti said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe 22nd Zanu PF National Peoples Conference delegates affirmed that Mnangagwas visionary leadership, marked by stability, economic recovery, and transformative national development, must continue to guide the nation beyond the current constitutional term limit.\n\n",
