            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nProphetic Healing and Deliverance Ministries founder, Walter Magaya, and his wife, Tendai, have been remanded in custody until this Tuesday following their appearance in court on fraud charges.\n\nThe couple is jointly charged with their company, Planet Africa, represented by Tendai Chinguwa.\n\nMagaya faces an extra charge of rape.\n\nThe duo appeared before Harare magistrate Marewanazvo Gofa, who is expected to hand down her ruling on their application demanding immediate release on the grounds that they were overdetained.\n\nTheir lawyer, Admire Rubaya, applied for their immediate release, arguing they were detained beyond the 48 hours allowed by law. He also raised complaints against the police.\n\nAccused 1 and 2 (Magaya and wife) were over-detained, said Rubaya. Magaya was arrested at 5am whilst praying in the prayer mountain, praying for everyone in this country. He was arrested by over 30 armed police officers. The accused is a man of God who cannot even harm a fly.\n\nSame applies to second accused, she has just been arrested because she is the wife of the first accused. She was arrested around 5.30am on Saturday. She was supposed to have been released at least by 5.30 am but wasnt. So the accused are here illegally.\n\nRubaya further told the court that the two were held incommunicado. They were not allowed to contact their lawyers. We visited CID Headquarters, where we had been advised they were. We were told they were not there. They were not permitted to contact their lawyers. They were not given access to their lawyers until after 11.30am on November 1, 2025, when one of the police officials who is a lawyer, Julia Chidumwa, contacted the lawyers so that we have access to them. She had to come to where we were at CID Headquarters to take us to the seventh floor, where the accused were being held. So from 5.30 to 11.30, they had no access to their lawyers and those constitutional rights were violated, he said.\n\nRubaya requested to lead Magaya to confirm the time of his arrest.\n\nState representative Clemence Chimbari admitted that the two were overdetained.\n\nRubaya argued that their constitutional rights had been violated. In their mind, they believe it is inconsequential but the Constitution is clear. Even if it is the state, they are obliged to follow the law, he said, adding that an exception could only be made if a court grants a warrant of further detention.\n\nHe said since the state admitted that the two were over-detained, the court should release them unconditionally.\n\nIt is our submission that you cannot put something on nothing. It will collapse. The state is asking you to put the accused on remand notwithstanding over-detention. Its no longer an alleged fact but a fact as confirmed by the state, said Rubaya.\n\nSo the state is coming to you to say we know they were over-detained but we dont care. Place them on remand. That on its own, is unconstitutional. They want to tell us there is a difference between the ZRP and the state.\n\nHe added, The main point we are raising is that the over-detention cannot be inconsequential. The law is clear. The law is bringing the accused after 48 hours. And they concede that it is after 48 hours. This court has jurisdiction to order that the accused persons be released unconditionally. If they want to arrest them after the release, they can do that and we will deal with them then. If they want to proceed by way of summons, they are at liberty to do so. What we are not allowing them is to contaminate the law by applying to place them on remand, yet they were detained beyond 48 hours.\n\nChimbari said there is a remedy.\n\nThe remedy for an infringement of a constitutional right the accused can approach the Constitutional Court for compensation or damages.\n\nChimbari said if the Court allows the immediate release, it will be overstepping its judicial powers.\n\nThe rape case was heard in-camera after the public and journalists were asked to leave.\n\nGofa will hand down her ruling Tuesday morning.\n\n",

That is loyalty, l stand with the President, his two vice presidents, his ministers and advisors.\n\nI am saying this because there are rumours circulating to the effect that l want to takeover from my father (Mnangagwa). I am not a mentally deranged to plot to takeover from my fathers role when he is still in that position, said Tungwarara.\n\nZanu PF national commissar Munyaradzi Machacha and Provincial Affairs Minister Misheck Mugadza were among high-ranking party officials, who attended the event.\n\nAffiliates which received varying amounts of money included Boyz DzaMudhara, Crossborders4ED, Pastors 4ED, Hairdressers 4ED, among others.\n\nHimself a controversial character whose family members flaunt wealth on social media while abroad on shopping jaunts, Tungwarara is a beneficiary of Mnangagwas governments largesse, with his Prevail International Group getting lucrative tenders.\n\n",
