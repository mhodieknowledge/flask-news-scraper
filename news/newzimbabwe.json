It also suggested simplifying the Zimbabwean dollars exchange rate system, which it believes is inconsistent with a floating rate.\n\nHowever, the RBZ disagreed, asserting that its current approach provides essential flexibility for stabilizing the currency and strengthening reserves. The central bank emphasized that its involvement in the FX market is necessary to maintain exchange rate stability and questioned the IMFs recommendation to reduce its role.\n\nOn broader monetary policy, the IMF proposed phasing out Non-Negotiable Certificates of Deposit (NNCDs) and replacing them with tradable securities to improve liquidity management. The RBZ responded by outlining plans to reduce reliance on direct monetary tools and improve policy transmission, including the introduction of a Term Deposit Facility.\n\nAdditionally, the RBZ rejected IMF claims about exchange rate restrictions, stating that recent reforms have removed all formal restrictions and any remaining measures are internal procedures by financial institutions, not government-imposed.\n\nDespite the disagreements, the RBZ expressed openness to future adjustments, such as enhancing the FX market with greater transparency and exploring IMF technical assistance.\n\nThe central bank also reaffirmed its commitment to price stability and long-term reforms, with plans to transition to a mono-currency system by 2030.\n\n",

We are talking of something that is unconstitutional, and the multitudes and the power of Zimbabweans will only lead to endorse what is constitutional. We are not going to be held hostage by a few individuals, said Fambi.\n\nIn its plot to extend Mnangagwas tenure, Zanu PF is hoping to take advantage of the opposition, which is in disarray.\n\nHowever, the bid has ignited factionalism within the ruling party, with one side emerging to resist the plan and back Mnangagwas deputy, Constantino Chiwenga, to succeed him.\n\nSeveral politicians including Tendai Biti have also vowed to fight Zanu PFs tenure extension.\n\nIn a political landscape that has a plethora of opposition parties, NPD deputy leader Kumbirayi Chenhare said they have the wherewithal to challenge Zanu PFs hegemony.\n\nWe are from the people, by the people, so our strength lies in the masses. Therefore, we will be well-funded and accepted, said Chenhare.\n\n",
