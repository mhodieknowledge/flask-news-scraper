We have other players who are performing very well.\n\nBut if you ask me, we are very happy with his development and we hope this continues especially with focus on Marchs international football fixtures.\n\nFollowing the expiration of Zemuras contract at Bournemouth, he penned a four-year deal with Udinese on a free transfer.\n\nDespite interest from clubs across Europe and beyond,Zimbabwes head coach suggests the Bluenergy Stadium is the perfect place for him to flourish.\n\nHe continued:I want him to be happy where he plays and to perform good.\n\nFor me as a national coach, Im happy if hes regularly playing in his club.\n\nNees was appointed Zimbabwes head coach in July 2024, replacing indigenous manager Jairos Tapera.\n\nThe 57-year-old is no stranger to African football, having previously managedSeychellesandRwanda, and also serving asSouth Africas technical advisor.\n\nConfident in his credentials, the German coach is eager to guide Zimbabwe to a strong performance at the 2025 Africa Cup of Nations, where they will faceEgypt, South Africa, andAngolain Group B.\n\nHe added:Ive worked in a few more countries like that, and its different in various positions. I think I have a versatile background.\n\nFootball is not only decided with training on the pitch, its decided by many things, especially as a national coach, and I think I can bring a very versatile experience. That I can confidently say.\n\nIve worked in many different positions. I was in various tournaments in different positions, so I know the different points which can affect performance.\n\nBut let me be honest, I think this AFCON will be very well organized and definitely fair.\n\nWe have about 11 months to prepare and we will plan accordingly, and we will try our best. Lets see what comes out.\n\nAgain, I believe in our team, in our players first, but we will respect our opponent.\n\nOn the countrys readiness forMorocco2025, he said:Were still in the process. I came six months ago, and were still developing.\n\nWe have a lot of potential to improve, but I think weve performed quite well so far. Otherwise, we wouldnt have qualified, so we can be satisfied with our progress.\n\nLets see. The AFCON is months away, which is a long time. First, the preparation is divided into organizational and sporting aspects.\n\nFrom an organizational standpoint, this is a huge advantage. Everything is already well-prepared, with team-based camps and hotels arranged, so in a way, theres not much we can influence in that regard.\n\nThe Warriors were disqualified from the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations in Cte dIvoire due to a FIFA suspension. However, they have qualified for the finals five times, although they have yet to progress beyond the group stage.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nCoffee entrepreneur, Sbu Nkolothi, the owner and inspiration behind Coffee LAB in Ballito, was chosen as Kwazulu Natals top coffee venue in the Battle of the Beans competition sponsored by Selati Sugar.\n\nNkolothi hails from Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe where he started out as a golf caddy before moving to Durban during the FIFA World Cup in 2010. After a variety of odd jobs, he started working at a popular restaurant where he learned to make coffee and appreciate good food.\n\nSoon, he was making coffee at workspaces and learning everything he could from the coffee mentors who took him under his wing.\n\nHe also became interested in the history of coffee making and studied everything he could about it. He went on to train baristas, which he says was an important opportunity to uplift people and develop skills that would, ultimately, lead to work opportunities.\n\nIn 2020, he opened Coffee LAB, which was almost an immediate hit. However, this extremely modest entrepreneur believes the value of good coffee does not remain in the cup. Coffee brings people together. It connects them. When I make coffee, Im able to engage in and build relationships with them through my coffee. I love people, he says.\n\nAsked how he was drawn to coffee, Nkolothi says: The funny thing is coffee found me  it was a surprise. I started in 2010 as a barista at Mama Lucianas. It was my big coffee break and there was this big coffee machine and I was the guy. The coffee was just giving me peace and love and connecting me with people ever since.\n\nHe then started a facebook page to learn more and connect with coffee professionals all over the world. Everything started to shape up. I was understanding what coffee was all about, training myself, and communicating with people. Coffee is more about character.\n\nAttitude is everything. You can be the best barista in the world but if your character is not right, you are not authentic.\n\nHe soon started training other baristas.\n\nThe Coffee Lab was a dream. It was never meant to be a coffee shop, but more a coffee cabin, he says. Retrenched in 2020, he got a call from the art gallery to open in the foyer. When something is meant to be, its meant to be, Nkolothi says. Up until today coffee has been a passion.\n\nNkolothi has three young girls and loves reading. He also loves it when people drop by to watch football. Hes a Liverpool fan.\n\nThe first runner up in the Battle of the Beans was Lineage, Hillcrest whose owner, Craig Charity, has been at the forefront of coffee roasting and making in KZN for over a decade.\n\nThe second runner up was another relative newcomer to the industry, Skyline Salt Rock. Originally the coffee shop was part of Skyline Coffee Roasters in Morningside but new owner, Darren Lewis, bought the shop in 2023. He says he bought the venue due to its great community spirit. He was a former regional manager for Vida e in KZN.\n\nA good coffee shop is about serving consistently good coffee and food, knowing every regulars coffee order and name. We have over 100 regulars who come to the store five to six times a week, he says.\n\nTop barista was Keagon Chavoos from Crane Flower Coffee in Kloof.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nTURNER farm residents in Mt Hampden, who are facing displacement to pave way for the development of the new multi-million-dollar Zim Cyber City project, 26 kilometres northwest of Harare, are appealing to the government to provide a clear timeline for their relocation.\n\nThe displacement will affect thousands of residents, but the affected persons say the uncertainty is hindering them from making long-term plans.\n\nThe cyber city, estimated to cost around US$60 billion when complete, will be part of Zimbabwes proposed new administrative capital, also known as New Harare.\n\nAs a precursor to the evictions, the government unilaterally exhumed about 1 000 graves between June and August last year, to pave way for the project.\n\nThe cyber city is being developed by United Arab Emirates-based industrial conglomerate Mulk International, which has injected an initial US$500 million.\n\nAn investigation conducted by NewZimbabwe.com, in conjunction with Information for Development Trust last year, revealed the community was in panic and fear as it faced eviction, relocation uncertainty, and job losses.\n\nThe residents, many of whom have lived in the area for decades have nowhere else to go.\n\nTamira Rufaso (40) said she and other residents were anxious because they do not know what lies ahead for them.\n\nWe are just hanging, waiting for something to happen, we are living on the edge, she said.\n\nThe Ministry of Local Government last year told this publication that affected residents would be moved by mid-2025 and that the government would find them a place to settle.\n\nResidents however say they have not been formally informed of the relocation.\n\nCosmas Mandipwanya, who has been living in Mt Hampden since 1994, pleaded with the government to communicate its position.\n\nWe are pleading with the government to at least give us enough information. They should give us the timelines so that we know when we are leaving and where we are going so that we can plan using the governments calendar, he said.\n\nRight now, I cannot even do a six-month or one-year project because we are scared that anytime we may be evicted.\n\nKungonzwa mota ichiuya wakutofunga kuti wavingwa kuzodzingwa (each time you see a vehicle approaching,you think they have come to evict you), he said.\n\nAnother resident, Amos Basi (48), said residents cant plan.\n\nWe are waiting to hear from the government. We have children to provide for, and right now we cannot even plan for the future. We cant even do our small projects like chicken rearing or gardens Basi said.\n\nResidents also said they were anxious about the impact the evictions would have on their childrens education.\n\nI have grandchildren in exam classes, some in primary school and another one in secondary school, and I am scared that we may get evicted before they write exams. If that happens, what will I do with them? Where will they go and learn?\n\nEphraim Kurushiwe (62), who has called Mt Hampden home since 1997, said his biggest fear is the risk of being homeless at an old age.\n\nI am asking the government to give us accommodation when they move us, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, President Emmerson Mnangagwas spokesperson, George Charamba, dismissed the residents plight on one of his X handle in November last year.\n\nSome stories hadzina mushumo, (are useless). Imagine a story featuring one seemingly distressed farm laborer standing in front of some dingy tenement of one room, all against a headline which says, thousands in distress from displacement by proposed Cyber City!\n\nThe solution implied in the article is that the Cyber City, which, like all cities, will house millions, has to wait for the sake of this wretch and his equally wretched tenement.\n\nTinombofungawo here tisati tanyora zvinyaya zvedu, nhai vanyori nevapepeti venhau (do you think before writing your stories) or we just believe in obstructive journalism, however stupid and futile? Charamba wrote.\n\nEfforts to get a comment from the local government ministry were fruitless. The ministrys spokesperson Gabriel Masvora kept saying he was looking for the information.\n\nMost of the affected residents have no other place to go, as they are mainly children of deceased farm workers originally from Mozambique, Malawi, and Zambia, with some from Zimbabwe.\n\nBetween the early 1900s and the mid-1960s, a significant number of people migrated from Malawi (then known as Nyasaland) to Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia) for various reasons, including the pursuit of higher-paying jobs.\n\nNyasaland, like Zimbabwe, was a British colony but was more densely populated and less economically developed. This economic disparity prompted many to move in search of better employment opportunities.\n\nDuring the same era, Zimbabwe also drew labourers from Mozambique and Zambia.\n\n",

It is not correct that all medicines werecoming through USAID, I think it was 31%.\n\nWe have medicines to takeus up to the end of June but by June, we will have replenished.\n\nPeople should not panic, there is enough medication and medication will be available forever, Mombeshora said.\n\nMombeshora also said the termination of USAID funding has led to job losses for healthcare personnel in HIV treatment clinics, disrupted transport for remote healthcare access, and has forced the ministry to seek additional funding to address these challenges.\n\nThe health ministry will be approaching Parliament for support during the supplementary budget for review.\n\nWe are therefore seized with scouting for replacements. The other challenge that we are facing pertains to vehicles and motorbikes which were used by healthcare personnel to access remote clinics.\n\nMotorbikes which were used to transport blood samples were also affected by theexecutive order.\n\nThis has culminated into a situation where our Ministry is in the process of requesting extra funding to cater for such key personnel, Mombeshora said.\n\nBefore the funding cut, Zimbabwe used to receive over $200 million annually from the U.S. Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the U.S government has given Zimbabwe over $1.7 billion since 2006 to strengthen health systems and support people living with HIV.\n\n",

            "content": "News24\n\nThe African Unions (AU) mission to the US has engaged the services of a Florida-based lobby group to urge the Trump administration to lift targeted sanctions on senior Zimbabwean officials, including that of the countrys, President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nA Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) filing from December last year shows that the AU mission engaged lobby group Ford and London Global Strategies, in a bid to lift targeted sanctions on Zimbabwe and foster a renewed partnership between the US and Zimbabwe.\n\nZimbabwe and the AU have long called for all sanctions to be lifted.The FARA filing shows that the AUs mission is optimistic that the Trump administration might be more receptive to this request than the Biden White House.\n\nAU ambassador to the US, Hilda Suka-Mafudze, wrote in an email to the lobby group last year that lifting sanctions on Zimbabwean individuals and entities would benefit the US by securing vital resources, creating economic opportunities for US businesses, and reasserting American leadership in southern Africa.\n\nShe pitched the idea that bilateral trade and investment agreements could prioritise US businesses under the America First strategy, ensuring US firms have preferential access to Zimbabwes markets and resources. Suka-Mafudzes email sets out the key messages she wants the lobby group to take to its meeting with team Trump. One of her proposals includes the line: Countering Chinese Influence.\n\nSuka-Mafudze writes that the US could benefit from Zimbabwes strategic location in Southern Africa, its critical minerals, and its workforce while reducing the regions dependence on Chinese investments. Aligning with Zimbabwe could counterbalance Chinas growing influence in the region and open avenues for US investments in agriculture, mining, and infrastructure, she adds.\n\nChina is one of Zimbabwes largest trading partners. According to the Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe, bilateral trade between China and Zimbabwe was upwards of $3.8bn, in 2024.\n\nThe US first sanctioned Zimbabwe in 2001 under the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act. This suite of sanctions was based on allegations of political repression, election rigging, land seizures, and corruption under former President Robert Mugabe.\n\nFormer US President Joe Biden ended this sanctions programme in March last year, unblocking all individuals, entities, and property previously affected.\n\nHowever, the US then proceeded to impose new targeted sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Programme on 11 individuals and three entities.\n\nThose sanctioned included Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, first lady Auxillia Mnangagwa, and first Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nThe US has hit back against claims that the sanctions are responsible for Zimbabwes economic woes, saying they target only a handful of Zimbabweans.\n\n",
