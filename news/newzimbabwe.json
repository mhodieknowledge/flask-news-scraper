            "content": "BBC\n\nUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to begin the process of withdrawing the US from the World Health Organization (WHO).\n\nOooh, thats a big one, the newly inaugurated US president said as he approved the document after arriving back at the White House. It was one of dozens of executive actions he put his signature to on day one in office.\n\nThis marks the second time Trump has ordered the US be pulled out of the WHO.\n\nTrump was critical of how the international body handled Covid-19 and began the process of pulling out from the Geneva-based institution during the pandemic. President Joe Biden later reversed that decision.\n\nCarrying out this executive action on day one makes it more likely the US will formally leave the global agency.\n\nThey wanted us back so badly so well see what happens, Trump said in the Oval Office, referring to the WHO, perhaps hinting the US might return eventually.\n\nThe order said the US was withdrawing due to the organizations mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic that arose out of Wuhan, China, and other global health crises, its failure to adopt urgently needed reforms, and its inability to demonstrate independence from the inappropriate political influence of WHO member states.\n\nThe executive order also said the withdrawal was the result of unfairly onerous payments the US made to the WHO, which is part of the United Nations.\n\nWhen Trump was still in office the first time around he was critical of the organization for being too China-centric in its tackling of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nTrump accused the WHO of being biased towards China in how it issued guidance during the outbreak.\n\nUnder the Biden administration the US continued to be the largest funder of the WHO and in 2023 it contributed almost one-fifth of the agencys budget.\n\nThe organizations annual budget is $6.8 billion (5.5 billion).\n\nPublic health experts have been critical of Trumps decision to leave the WHO, warning there could be consequences for Americans health.\n\nSome have suggested the move could reverse progress made on fighting infectious diseases such as malaria, tuberculosis and Hiv & Aids.\n\nAshish Jha, who formerly worked as Covid-19 response co-ordinator under President Biden, previously warned leaving would harm not only the health of people around the world, but also US leadership and scientific prowess.\n\nIts a cataclysmic presidential decision. Withdrawal is a grievous wound to world health, but a still deeper wound to the US, Lawrence Gostin, a global public health expert and Georgetown University professor said.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.comhas invited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner atMadzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal)to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans living in the diaspora. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, we want to continue with our discussion from last week on Immigration Law, our readers were asking for further understanding on foreign Visa applications specifically as they relate to reasons for denials and the appeal processes in various countries\n\nLet me start by asking what are the common reasons for visa being denied?\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nWe touched on the issue briefly in my last interview with you.\n\nEach country has its own benchmark that has to be satisfied with visa applications. Further to the general benchmark set by the country of interest, each visa type, for example, visitors, working or asylum visa, has specific conditions that have to be met and the requirements are likely to be different from other visa types within the same country. It is essential that the applicant is able to discern the must-haves in the application and ensures that all the requirements of the must haves are included with supporting evidence or thoroughly explained.\n\nIn general terms, visa applications are denied because applicants have failed to satisfy the immigration officer reviewing the application that they qualify for the visa under the application. This could be as a result of failing to supply sufficient supporting information for the type of visa or where the country receiving the application utilizes a score point approach, a failure to score enough points for the visa. Incorrect or false information may also disqualify a person from securing a visa.\n\nPast activities like a criminal record or history of overstaying in the host country may hinder or reduce the chances of securing a visa as this portrays an applicant as an undesirable person.\n\nRELATED:Legal Discussions With Vengai Madzima: Foreign Visa Applications\n\nReporter: Can a person be denied a visa or entry into a country because of HIV status?\n\nVM: Each country will have its own requirements on the different visa categories on who can enter the country and can list the reasons and requirements for qualification.\n\nGenerally, international human rights laws discourage discrimination on the basis of HIV status. Countries that are signatories of human rights protocols are under obligation to treat all applicants equally and without discrimination. Should an applicant feel aggrieved by a decision based on their status, subject to the laws that land, I would encourage them to seek a review of that decision.\n\nReporter:In what circumstances should a person consider reapplying for a visa instead of appealing?\n\nVM: After having read and understood the reason for the visa denial and seeing that it will be impossible to gather sufficient information to satisfy the immigration officer in the period afforded to submit an appeal by the particular country, the applicant can opt to reapply as it affords them sufficient time to gather evidence and deal with the areas where the previous application fell short.\n\nThis also applies in situations where the initial application had insufficient supporting evidence. A reapplication affords the applicant the opportunity to submit an improved application with better chances of success. Reapplication however does not necessarily guarantee success, it improves the chances. Most countries have sections within their application forms which allow you to explain why the previous visa was declined.\n\nIn circumstances where a person was banned from reapplication, an appeal process may be the only option available where the country offers appeals against bans.\n\nReporter: In what circumstances will an appeal be the best option to take?\n\nVM: In cases where the applicant has been banned and the country offers an option to appeal the decision. In such a case, the appeal process will be the best option to address the banning where the applicant considers the decision to be unjustified.\n\nFurther, where the Applicant understands or fully comprehends the reasons the visa application was declined and is capable of getting the supporting information within the period afforded to submit an appeal, then an appeal may be the best route. It is important that the Applicant avoids mistakes in the appeal process and addresses all areas of concern,\n\nReporter: Can I appeal again if my visa application was refused on appeal?\n\nVM: Generally, most countries allow for one appeal. However, rules differ per country under application. Unless the visa denial also bans reapplication, the applicant has the option of reapplying and addressing in the fresh application all issues they neglected to address in the initial application and the appeal\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima atvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

To succeed in the international honey market, producers must meet several critical requirements like quality standards such as those set by the Codex Alimentarius.\n\nEnsuring low moisture content, appropriate sucrose levels, and the absence of contaminants is essential for market acceptance, the agency said.\n\nZimTrade also called for securing organic certification can significantly enhance the marketability of Zimbabwean honey, particularly in the European Union and the United States with Fair Trade and other ethical certifications can further add value.\n\nZimTrade said honey intended for export must be packaged in a way that preserves its quality during transit as labels should comply with the regulations of the destination market, including details on nutritional content, country of origin, and certifications.\n\nCompliance with the phytosanitary standards of importing countries is crucial. Zimbabwean producers need to adhere to these regulations to avoid barriers to market entry, the agency said.\n\nHoney production in Zimbabwe is steadily growing, with the country boasting a vibrant beekeeping industry, producingan average of 400,000 kilograms of honey annually, primarily concentrated in the Manicaland province, particularly the Chimanimani, Nyanga, and Chipinge districts.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nOPERATIONS by Chinese miner Chengxi Pvt Ltd, which is in partnership with President Emmerson Mnangagwas son Collins, have left hundreds of houses in Shurugwi Town with cracks with residents living in fear that their homes may collapse, an investigation by NewZimbabwe.com has established.\n\nThe investigation, in partnership with Information for Development Trust (IDT) also established that Chengxis operations have disrupted livelihoods and caused air and water pollution, besides the well-documented environmental damage on the iconic Wolfshall Pass, also known as Boterekwa escarpment.\n\nThe environmental damage has extended to the picturesque Dunraven Falls, which is a tourist attraction, and a place where villagers used to conduct rituals.\n\nChengxi also cut off villagers from their fields, pastures and areas they used to pick mushrooms and wild fruits, by deploying armed guards to protect its claims.\n\nThe investigation established that a villager, Emmanuel Geje (20), was shot and injured by a Chengxi Chinese employee on 4 September 2024. Villagers also say company employees and guards have occasionally set dogs on them for straying onto their claims.\n\nMany villagers say they have silently endured abuse by the company because of its association with the presidents son and senior Zanu PF officials.\n\nLast year, Chengxi constructed the Zanu PF District Party offices in Shurugwi.\n\nMidlandss Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Owen Ncube, who is Mnangagwas close ally, officiated at the commissioning.\n\nChengxi has been carrying out open-cast gold mining in Shurugwi since 2021.\n\nThe entity is a privately owned mining company with a notable presence in Southeast Asia, East Africa, and Central America.\n\nLocally, its ownership details remain somewhat obscure, although it is known that Collins Mnangagwa, serves as the chairman and senior partner of the gold mining company.\n\nSpeaking at the handover ceremony of Zanu PF offices, Chengxi general manager Simon Karimanzira named Collins Mnangagwawho was also presenta senior partner.\n\nThe company is operating heavy machinery including excavators, rigs and dump trucks. It is conducting massive open pit mining which threatens to deplete the area of its natural resources and grazing lands, jeopardising the livelihoods of future generations.\n\nOur investigations have established that heavy machinery and dump trucks disrupt the communitys longtime peace, operating relentlessly from dawn until dusk.\n\nThese heavy-duty trucks have also become common, even in the town centre.\n\nDump trucks and other machinery seen on site at Chengxi mine along Boterekwa pass\n\nBlasting and the fear of houses collapsing\n\nThe investigation established that Chengxi is using high-capacity explosives, whose impact is felt in Shurungwi residents homes. In some cases, ceilings have fallen while windows have broken during blasting.\n\nResidents say the blasting has weakened their houses and other infrastructure, leaving them worried that their homes may collapse. The situation is aggravated by the fact that most houses were built on top of underground mining tunnels.\n\nWindows have broken during blasting.\n\nChengxi is the main culprit because of the magnitude of their operations.\n\nThe impact of their blasting is felt far away from the mine but there are other Chinese and black-owned companies who are also contributing to the damage.\n\nNot houses only are affected. There are water reservoirs at MacKinnon Kopje where mining is taking place. There are also network boosters on this mountain as such they are all under threat, said Pardon Machocho the chairperson of Shurugwi Residents Trust.\n\nWe get complaints of houses cracking and in some cases, windows break and this happens frequently.\n\nHundreds of houses have been affected in Shurugwi urban our pleas have fallen on deaf ears.\n\nMachocho said disaster is looming in Shurugwi due to the combined effects of the blasting and the areas many underground tunnels.\n\nWe have petitioned the local authority and government but we are yet to get a meaningful action, he said.\n\nMachocho listed 17 affected residential areas, including Makusha, Ironsides, Ironkop, Dark City, Feny Creek, MacKinnon Kopje, Tebekwe, Camperdown, and Wanderer.\n\nSlyvia Moyo* (65) of Mambowa, a high-density suburb in Shurugwi said most houses are old having been built during the Smith regime.\n\nThis makes many houses vulnerable to collapsing, she said.\n\nWe live in fear due to the ongoing blasting by Chinese miners. Our houses sit above underground tunnels, and every blast feels like an earthquake. The risk of structural collapse is huge.\n\nOur houses have developed cracks which widen each time they blast. In some cases, ceilings collapse on us.The blasting is so intense that sometimes kitchen utensils such as water glasses get damaged, she said.\n\nThis reporter counted 20 houses around Leilano Lodge and Selukwe Primary School, close to the Central Business District, which had cracks. The owners say the cracks were a direct result of Chengxis blasting operations.\n\nChemicals, Dust and Visibility\n\nThe dust has also become an issue due to Chengxis Mining operations.\n\nResidents say pervasive red dust impacts visibility, making it hazardous for motorists, who often find it necessary to stop their vehicles, especially in the Boterekwa area during blasting operations.\n\nDust engulfs the environs after blasting\n\nBlasting is done randomly and community members say they are seldom informed of blasting schedules. Blasting occurs day and night.\n\nWe now have to damp-clean our houses constantly due to the dust, and children are at risk of being hit by vehicles, as visibility is often poor. But crucially, we wake up every day fearing for our lives, lamented Emilda Moyo*(38) from Feny Creek area.\n\nCommunity members also complained that chemicals are being washed into streams and rivers including the Mutevekwi River which is close to the Boterekwa area.\n\nChipo Mutuke*(40) a villager from Marishongwe said most Shurugwi villagers had resigned to fate because of Chengxis association with politicians.\n\nOur leaders (village heads) say they cant do anything because there are higher-ups involved in this exploitation, Mutuke said.\n\nThere are senior figures involved. This situation is talked about everywhere, yet help seems distant. The company is excavating everywhere. We no longer feel safe in our own homeland. They have desecrated places we hold sacred, dug up graves, and destroyed mountains; nothing remains for us to cherish.\n\nLeaching beds at the mine\n\nDisrupted Lifestyles\n\nVillagers said indigenous trees, including fruit trees, were being buried under Chengxis mine dumps. This reporterwitnessed this in Camperdown.\n\nThe trees such asmuzhanjeprovided a livelihood for the community members who would gather fruits for consumption and sale.\n\nThe company does not even give us a chance to cut the trees for firewood so that we at least benefit something, said Moyo.\n\nWe can no longer gather fruits or mushrooms in the forest, as they prohibit us from getting close to their mines. Grazing land for our livestock has been destroyed because vast stretches of forest have been cleared, which deeply concerns us. Arable land is slowly vanishing. Soon, everything will be lost.\n\nMoyo added: Dunraven Falls was once a sacred site for spiritual rituals, like rainmaking ceremonies. Now, the river is obstructed, and no water flows through the falls anymore.\n\nThis reporter observed armed guards at the Chengxi Peak mining area at the Boterekwa pass. Some guards were stationed at the Peak View tourist site to prevent people from approaching the claim.\n\nA guard room at Chengxi Dunraven claim\n\nThe news crew had to negotiate with some guards to be able to take pictures at the popular site.\n\nGejes Shooting\n\nVillagers revealed that tensions between guards and community members were common, often resulting in company security officials firing in the air or setting dogs on trespassers.\n\nA Shurugwi resident, Emmanuel Geje was shot in the right leg by a Chinese national employed by Chengxi at its Dunraven mining claim on September 4, last year.\n\nGeje told NewZimbabwe.com that he was passing through the area on his way to buy fuel. He said he has not been given an explanation why he was shot.\n\nThe company gave me US$5 000 for medication but I never really got answers regarding why I was shot. It was even difficult to get them to pay for my medication. My relatives had to intervene, he said.\n\nChengxi general manager Simon Karimanzira admitted that the incident happened, but said Geje had trespassed onto the companys premises.\n\nHe is an illegal miner and it is a lie that he was just passing by, Karimanzira said.\n\nIt was a cat and mouse day. They had illegally trespassed. The fact is that they cornered our guy together with his colleagues. It was 10 of them and our guy shot him to protect himself.\n\nShurugwi MP speaks out\n\nShurugwi North legislator Joseph Mpasi, whom villagers allege is close to Chengxi officials and other Chinese miners, said he had not received a formal complaint from Shurugwi residents.\n\nHe dissociated himself from the company although he maintained it was operating above board.\n\nPeople complain that they are destroying their land but they do not understand the mining operations now happening in their land, he said.\n\nHe attributed the villagers concerns over the destruction of the environment to the fact that they had not witnessed large-scale mining before.\n\nGrowing up in this area, we have never seen massive mining taking place, so people are now having concerns, but these are legally pegged claims. They have been there for many years for the purposes of mining chrome and gold, Mpasi said.\n\nI have overheard people talking but officially no one approached me to say we have a challenge. If they come to me and say the Chinese are not obeying the laws of Zimbabwe and are not doing the right thing, they do not have EIA, I will obviously attend to that because it is my duty as an MP. I wont be aware if they dont tell me.\n\nChengxi is doing a lot. They are drilling boreholes and employing our people. They are also helping contractors to mine  But we have got about a quarter of the Chinese that are not even doing anything to the community where they are operating from.\n\nOur operations are above board: Chengxi\n\nKarimanzira confirmed that Chengxi holds claims in Peak Area Boterekwa, Wanderer and Danranven areas of Shurugwi, which many villagers saw as tourist attractions.\n\nHe, however, dismissed concerns that the company was destroying tourist attractions.\n\nIf we look back, how much was realised through tourism from the Boterekwa area? Compare that with what we are getting out of there now. We extract gold and send it to Fidelity for the betterment of our economy, Karimanzira said.\n\nMy company has been operating in Shurugwi since December 2021. My company legally acquired all the mining claims it is operating and its certificates are up to date and on some of the claims we are currently in the process of consolidating our EIAs as we are a company that believes in 100 % compliance with the laws of Zimbabwe.\n\nHe confirmed that Chengxi has been fined for flouting environmental, labour, safety or mining laws and that villagers had raised concerns over the blasting, but insisted nothing was amiss.\n\nIts not a peculiar situation for a big company like ours to receive a few tickets and orders from time to time and because we are a law-abiding company with compliance legal documents we have never been shut down, Karimanzira said.\n\nOn the issue of blasting, we have reviewed our blasting techniques and timetable working closely with the Ministry of Mines and at some point we actually voluntarily suspended our blasting to address the concerns of the community because we want to coexist in harmony with our community and nature.\n\nKaraimanzira said Chengxi was conducting open cast gold mining and dismissed concerns that the companys operations were causing the siltation of rivers.\n\nIn cases where our operations encounter feeder streams or small streams within our mining claims we consult EMA and upper Runde Sub catchment council hydrologists to help us construct certified water diversions which do not harm the ecosystem. Remember we subscribe to the principle of living in harmony with nature, he said.\n\nHe also denied allegations that the company was discharging chemicals into the environment and water bodies.\n\nWe work closely with EMA. They come and conduct periodical testing of water sources within our mining areas and we have not been found wanting of any violations of chemical discharge into the environment, he said.\n\nIn cases where we sought to acquire more land, we worked and continue to work closely with the Lands office and DDCs office to help facilitate win-win compensation agreements with affected community members so it would be a distortion to suggest that we displace community members without any valuable compensation packages.\n\nAn official from the Ministry of Mines acknowledged the environmental degradation but indicated that rehabilitation efforts would only commence once the mineral resources in these areas have been depleted.\n\nThe officials interviewed by our publication were evasive, often deferring questions to one another.\n\nThe Environmental Management Agency (EMA) said commenting on the situation was challenging due to the involvement of multiple sectors in mining.\n\nEMA spokesperson Amkela Sidange directed this reporter to the mines licensing department, although she did not attend to questions about environmental violations.\n\nProvincial Mining Director Khumbulani Mlangeni said a rehabilitation plan was in place for Boterekwa.\n\nWe will be monitoring compliance. The mines hold legal titles, and rehabilitation will only occur after the economic resource is depleted. Many matters relate to EMA compliance, and I believe they have conducted EIAs, he said.\n\nAccording to the Centre for Natural Resources and Governance (CNRG), Chengxis mining activities have far-reaching consequences and are exacerbating climate risks for local inhabitants.\n\nCNRG director Farai Muguwu said that due to slime spillages, the villages surrounding the Boterekwa River can no longer safely use the river water for domestic or agricultural purposes. Community members have also stated that they are losing a major tourist attraction at Boterekwa Falls due to blasting, slime dams, and general deterioration of air quality.\n\nThe hills, which serve as vital aquifers, are being destroyed, disrupting the delicate water table and rendering the local population increasingly vulnerable to droughts, Maguwu said.\n\nThis ecological onslaught not only jeopardises the regions biodiversity but also undermines the livelihoods of local communities, who depend on these natural resources for their survival.\n\nThe long-term effects of this environmental degradation will be catastrophic, perpetuating a cycle of poverty, displacement, and human suffering.\n\n*Names have been changed to avoid victimisation\n\n",

            "content": "City Press\n\nGlobally, people wanting tolose weightare turning toOzempic, the so-called miracle drug prescribed for diabetes management and weight loss.\n\nHowever, two major studies conducted at the University of Southern Denmark have shown that Ozempic more than doubles the risk for patients of developing a rare, but serious, condition of the optic nerve that can lead to blindness. This condition is caused by a sudden loss of blood to the optic nerve and can result in permanent blindness, writes Dr Paul Ian Cross in the MedicalNewsToday, a health information website.\n\nIn the first Danish study, 424 152 patients with diabetes were monitored over five years. The incidence of non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (Naion) increased from nine to 23 per 100 000 among patients using Ozempic.\n\nThe study, published in the latest issue of the International Journal of Retina and Vitreous, states:\n\nIn the second study among 62 000 Danes and Norwegians, the incidence of Naion rose to 21 per 100 000.\n\nCross emphasises that the researchers do not suggest diabetic patients stop their treatment with Ozempic, but rather that the incidence of Naion should be monitored. Patients with untreated diabetes can also develop eye complications, but these are usually less severe than Naion.\n\nThis drug works by mimicking a natural hormone that signals the brain that the person is full. It also slows down the digestion process, according to a report from the University of California. The drug was developed for long-term use, with weight loss being one of the side effects experienced by diabetics on the medication.\n\nDr Marius Wasserfall, an internist  a doctor who specialises in internal organs and systems at Mediclinic, also warned last year that serious, although rare, side effects of Ozempic use could include inflammation of the pancreas and gallbladder problems.\n\nAccording to Wasserfall, people could also regain most of the weight they had lost when they stopped using the medication.\n\n",
