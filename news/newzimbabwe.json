            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nHOLY Ten, an eccentric character on Zimbabwes Hip Hop scene by any margin, has told President Emmerson Mnangagwas son Collins not to entertain thoughts of sending people after him, as that will only confirm that his father runs a terrorist organisation, Zanu PF.\n\nHoly Ten, born Mukudzei Chitsama, broke the internet over the weekend when he went on an online rant, laying into Collins and his twin brother Sean for sending Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) and army officers to his home.\n\nIn other posts, shared on Facebook and Instagram, he sent coded messages that they had been showering him with expensive gifts such as a house and cars, which he said they could now take back.\n\nHe went as far as declaring that he was bigger than the ruling Zanu PF party and could take the whole institution down, in what many have interpreted as a message passed in drunken stupor.\n\nHis last post on X, formerly Twitter, took aim at Collins, whose brother Sean is also an Army Major.\n\nDear Collins Mnangagwa, you cant touch me and the moment you try, youre really proving to all of us that you and your father run a terrorist organisation. Leave me alone, said Holy Ten.\n\nOnce the fastest rising talent in Zimbabwes music industry, Holy Tens career took a nasty nose dive after he laid into popular Zim Dance Hall chanter Winky D.\n\nHis tirade against Winky D, which came after the release of a red hot collaboration,Ibotso, was blamed on unidentified drugs and alcohol, a challenge he has accepted to have been dealing with for over two years. Ibotso, which he disputed, highlighted how the high and mighty were taking all that was supposed to benefit the downtrodden.\n\nHis tweet, however, comes a day after he apologised for his online tirade, captured live on Instagram.\n\nI joined Zanu PF because I was trying to clean the reputation, the image of Zanu PF. What you did, boys, I can finish all of you off. I can end the Zanu PF today. Im bigger than the Zanu PF, he said\n\nHoly Ten has in the past posted images of himself clad in army regalia, brandishing the Zanu PF clenched fist and openly campaigned for Mnangagwa.\n\nAccording to sources closer to his circle of friends, he was gifted, by the Mnangagwa twins, a fully furnished house and numerous cars, one of which he presented to his wife, Kimberly Richards, before repossessing it to pay a debt.\n\nUnconfirmed reports from Zimbabwean socialites indicate that Richards could have been in an extramarital affair with one of Mnangagwas sons, something that could be leading to his constant meltdowns.\n\nRichards, the Mnangagwa twins, Zanu PF, government and Mnangagwa himself are yet to comment on the matter that has raised questions on abuse of CIO and military personnel for personal benefits.\n\n",

Its also garnered 2.7-million Shazams, underlining its global appeal.Now, the highly anticipated remix introduces a fresh Afro-fusion twist, blending amapianos infectious rhythms with Davidos signature Afrobeats energy.We wanted it to speak to a wider market while maintaining the core vibe, says Maphorisa.The goal was to blend amapiano and Afrobeats  sounds that represent South Africa and Nigeria and create something all of Africa can vibe to.According to the producer, the collaboration came about organically during a trip to Nigeria.We were in Nigeria last year and the reception to Biri Marung was massive. It just made sense to bring in Davido and elevate the track even further.For Ego Slimflow, one of the creative forces behind the hit, the journey has been surreal.Sometimes we doubt how powerful music really is, but this journey has been a blessing and a constant reminder of its impact.As Amapiano continues to break boundaries, cross-continental collaborations like this are proving essential to its global rise.Amapiano is still a baby, says Maphorisa.
