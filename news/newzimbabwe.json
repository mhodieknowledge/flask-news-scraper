Women in the lowest wealth quintile have significantly more children (5.5) compared to those in the highest quintile (2.6). Women in the lowest wealth quintile have their first birth, on average, three years earlier (19.0 years) than women in the highest quintile (21.9 years), the study says.These findings mirror the situation in Zimbabwe where couples, especially in urban areas are reducing the sizes of their families.Total Fertility Rate (TFR)  the average number of children a woman would have by the end of her childbearing years if she bore children at the current age-specific fertility rates  dropped 4.3 children per woman in 1994 to 3.8 in 2005-06. Since then, it has remained largely stable, currently standing at 3.9 in the 2023-24 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey.On average, a woman in Zimbabwe will have about four children in her lifetime (TRF 3.9).

Women in urban areas begin childbearing 2 years later, on average, than rural women (21.1 versus 19.4 years).Even if women, especially those in the workplace, desire to have more children childcare responsibilities often makes it difficult for them to pursue career advancement, maintain full-time employment or engage in professional development opportunities. This in part explains why women in the highest wealth quintile have fewer children.In his keynote address to mark the World Population Day, which coincided with the reports launch, Health and Child Care Minister, Dr Douglas Mombeshora affirmed the governments stance on upholding reproductive rights.The Government of Zimbabwe upholds reproductive rights, empowering individuals to choose the number, timing, and spacing of children they want to have, free from coercion.Fertility rates are a key driver of Zimbabwes continued population growth and contribute significantly to its youthful demographic structure. We will continue to support policies to ensure we prevent low birth rates, he said.UK Development Director and Deputy Head of Mission Dr. Jo Abbot said the UK is proud to stand with Zimbabwe and UNFPA in championing reproductive rights and choices.Vast numbers of people are unable to create the families they want, said Dr. Natalia Kanem, Executive Director of UNFPA.The issue is lack of choice, not desire, with major consequences for individuals and societies.

The donor community has played a pivotal role in easing deficits experienced in the countrys health sector over the years.But speaking during a plenary discussion at a UNFPA organized event to officially commemorate the World Population Day, British Embassy Health Adviser, Tessa Mattholie warned that it will not be business as usual anymore.The amount of money coming from external partners into the health sector in just Zimbabwe alone is about half a billion US dollars a year, about 500 million US dollars a year. When you look at the money that was coming from the Americans, from the global funds, from all the partners and the pooled funds in the health sector, she said.Mattholie said its not just the American money thats reducing as underscored that across all of Europe there are reasons why Overseas Development Assistance is shrinking as well, including from the UK.She said this role of international finance in the Zimbabwean health sector is going to decrease and insisted on the importance of increasing domestic financing.So again, looking at our Ministry of Finance colleagues, obviously its really important that Ministry of Finance disbursements can honour their budgetary commitments because the health sector is going to increasingly need to now rely on domestic financing so thats the point on finance, and everybody has a part to play there in holding government to account, she added.\n\nThe calls come on the back of the US bold decision to cut back financial handouts globally a move which has left the developing world in dire straits.
