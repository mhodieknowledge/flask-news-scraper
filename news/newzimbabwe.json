            "content": "IOL\n\nThe Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) have announced a dramatic venue change, in an unexpected twist in the lead-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers next month.\n\nTheir pivotal clash against South Africas Bafana Bafana, originally slated for South African soil, will now take place at the Obed Itani Chilume Stadium in Francistown, Botswana, on October 10, 2025.\n\nThis decision comes about because Zimbabwe have issues with hosting international matches at home due to a FIFA ban stemming from stadium concerns.\n\nZimbabwe have previously held their home qualifiers in South Africa, specifically utilising popular venues such as Orlando Stadium. The transition to Botswana is seen as a move to create a more logistical and fan-friendly environment for their supporters.\n\nLocal sources from the Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) report that the decision aims to make the match more accessible for both the Warriors fans. The move is significant as the fixture serves as a milestone in South Africas quest for World Cup qualification.\n\nAs it stands, South Africa leads the standings in Group C with 17 points from eight matches, putting them in pole position for qualification. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe languishes at the bottom with only four points, a stark reflection of their struggleshaving won merely two of their last 27 qualifiers since 2010.\n\nThis latest venue change adds further intrigue to a match that, while less critical for Zimbabwes aspirations, could serve as a defining moment for a Bafana squad looking to solidify their World Cup journey.\n\nThe Obed Itani Chilume Stadium, which boasts a capacity of 26,000, has been recognised as a reliable venue, previously hosting Namibia during their World Cup qualifiers, thus demonstrating its capability to cater to international football standards.\n\nThis choice of location not only provides a neutral ground but also enhances accessibility for Zimbabwean fans, who usually faced no challenges attending matches in South Africa.\n\nDespite Zimbabwes elimination from World Cup contention following a disappointing series of resultsincluding losses to Benin and Rwandathis encounter with the Bafana is unlikely to diminish local interest. Providing a stage to showcase talent, the upcoming match may serve more as a platform for national pride and a precursor to the upcoming 2025 Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nHowever, the venue shift has left many fans puzzled; while the location changes, Zimbabwes hopeless position in the qualifiers is still unchanged. The decision ultimately raises questions about ZIFAs administrative strategy, especially as Zimbabwe prepares to face South Africa, Nigeria, and Lesotho, a task that seems more metaphorical than consequential.\n\nThe president of the Botswana Football Association, Tariq Babitseng, confirmed the hosting arrangement, emphasising the significance of this contest for Bafana as they aim for a win to bolster their World Cup bid.\n\nWith anticipation building, all eyes will be on Francistown this October, regardless of the unpredictable journey Zimbabwes Warriors have faced in their World Cup qualifiers.\n\n",

It undermines trust in financial institutions and affects genuine policyholders, said the NPAZ.\n\nThe NPAZ says it has come out to descend heavily on insurance fraudsters.\n\nThe justice system will continue to impose tough penalties to deter such conduct, added NPAZ\n\nThe warning by prosecutors comes following the jailing of a 40-year-old Zvishavane man, Promise Banda, who faked his daughters death in order to defraud Ecosure Insurance Company (Econet Wireless) of US$6,250 in death benefits.\n\nThe court heard that on July 29, 2025, Banda misrepresented to Ecosure Insurance Company that his daughter, Chipo Enia Banda, had passed away.\n\nProsecutors proved that the accused person forged a Child Health Card, changing details to create a fictitious dependent. He then used the forged document to acquire a burial order number 526/25 from the Zvishavane District Registrars Office.\n\nThe offender submitted the burial order and false claims online to Ecosure Insurance Company, seeking to fraudulently obtain US$6,250 in death benefits.\n\nFollowing an investigation, authorities established that the supposed beneficiary did not exist and that the offender had acted intentionally to defraud the insurance firm.\n\nThe court found Banda guilty of fraud, noting that such schemes are deliberate attacks on financial institutions and erode public trust in insurance systems.\n\nAs a result, Banda was convicted of insurance fraud and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, of which four months were suspended on condition of good behaviour. He will, therefore, serve an effective 14 months behind bars.\n\n",

Mnangagwa is serving his second and final constitutional term, ending in 2028, though his allies have been lobbying for the postponement of elections to 2030.\n\nAt last years National Peoples Conference in Bulawayo, Zanu PF passed a resolution to extend Mnangagwas tenure until 2030 or beyond. The move, however, met resistance from rival factions within the party and war veterans believed to be backing Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, widely tipped as Mnangagwas likely successor.\n\nAddressing the Central Committee this Thursday, Mnangagwa hinted that the upcoming Mutare conference would be crucial in setting the partys direction, with the thorny succession question expected to dominate discussions.\n\nWe gather today, a few weeks before we hold the 22nd National Peoples Conference in the scenic City of Mutare, Manicaland Province.\n\nFurther, this meeting is being convened at a time when we have passed the halfway mark since our last Harmonised General Elections in 2023.\n\nIt is, therefore, of critical importance that we introspect as a Party, not only with regards to our short-term activities, but also in view of the bigger objective of ensuring that our party resoundingly wins the 2028 Harmonised General Elections, said Mnangagwa.\n\nTensions remain high within Zanu PF over the succession race. Business tycoon Kudakwashe Tagwirei, recently co-opted into the Central Committee, is reportedly eyeing the presidency, while Chiwenga is believed to command strong support from within party structures.\n\nMnangagwa urged members to stay grounded in the partys founding ethos while remaining focused on Vision 2030.\n\nLet us, as the leadership, continually align the membership of the Party to the founding ideology, values, principles and the overall provisions of the Party Constitution.\n\nThe wheels of our revolution should be kept moving, our grassroots membership and structures well-organised, mobilised and informed.\n\nAll of us must work harder, with determination and focus across all sectors, as we accelerate the realisation of Vision 2030, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, in Parliament on Wednesday, opposition MPs pressed government to clarify its position on implementing reforms outlined in the 2023 SADC Election Observer Report, recommendations critical ahead of future polls.\n\n",

Instead of creating a limited-access account as requested by a United Nations consultant working on the project, they allegedly built a hidden account with full administrative rights.\n\nUsing this backdoor, they manipulated clearing agents prepayment accounts, inserting fictitious deposits to make it appear as if customs duties had been paid. In reality, no money was received by ZIMRA. \n\nThe agents were then able to clear goods duty-free while the accused allegedly collected cash from them, sharing the proceeds.\n\nThe scam ran undetected for months, with prosecutors telling the court that by abusing their positions, the accused acted contrary to their duties as public officers, showing favour to themselves and prejudice to ZIMRA.\n\nNothing has been recovered from the multi-million-dollar fraud.\n\nThe two were remanded in custody pending finalisation of their bail hearing.\n\n",

Integrity, discipline and unity, concern for the people and clean governance must be synonymous with Zanu PF.\n\nAs provided for in our Party Constitution, we have a duty to boldly and decisively deal with those who put the name of the Party into disrepute. Winning the hearts and minds of our people remains a critical role of every cadre and structure of the Party, Mnangagwa said.\n\nHe also warned against the abuse of empowerment facilities designed to benefit grassroots communities, citing the recently launched Presidential Womens League Empowerment Fund as an example.\n\nRecently, I launched the Presidential Womens League Empowerment Fund to facilitate the expansion and diversification of various income-generating projects being implemented by women.\n\nAbuse of these facilities will not be accepted. We are a Party that honours the grassroots. We must maintain our character as an inclusive, fair and people-centred Party, he added.\n\nDespite the government rolling out various youth and womens empowerment programmes, critics argue that most of these facilities rarely reach the intended beneficiaries, particularly young people struggling to break into the formal economy.\n\n",
