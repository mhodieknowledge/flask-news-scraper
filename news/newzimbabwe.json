Masawi said myriad militating factors had necessitated the job cut.\n\nThe current economic environment in Zimbabwe has presented unprecedented challenges for Triangle Limited over the past three years, Masawi said.\n\nAmong other factors, Masawi said inflationary pressures, rising maintenance costs, and the inability to claim value-added tax (VAT) on inputs after sugar was exempted from VAT, have negatively impacted on the companys operations.\n\nEscalating operational costs, particularly in areas such as fertilizer, fuel, maintenance costs, and imported goods/services, combined with inflationary pressures, currency losses, the inability to claim VAT on inputs after sugar was exempted from VAT, and competition from low-cost duty-free imported sugar, have severely impacted our ability to sustain current levels of operation, said the managing director.\n\nSince 2022, we have seen profit margins decline significantly by 55%, manpower costs increasing by 133% as a proportion of revenue, and debt levels rising to unsustainable levels.\n\nThe company has been unable to generate positive cash flows from its operating activities for the past three years and has faced a very constrained working capital position since the implementation of the revised cane supply arrangements, which has necessitated constant trade-offs between what the business needs and what it can afford.\n\nThe decision to cut jobs was arrived at in order to ensure the company remains viable in the wake of an unrelenting and unfavourable economic climate.\n\nDespite implementing numerous cost-reduction and revenue-enhancement initiatives, these efforts have proven insufficient to stabilize the business. This decision has been taken to protect the long-term sustainability of our organization and ensure that Triangle Limited continues to play its vital role in Zimbabwes economy and the livelihoods of communities in the Lowveld region, Masawi said.\n\nThe company pledged to provide fair severance packages and support programmes for affected employees. Its also a committee to work closely with union representatives and other stakeholders to ensure the process is conducted transparently and fairly.\n\nTriangle said the decision is unrelated to the business rescue process of its South African shareholder or its acquisition by the Vision Consortium.\n\nSince 2022, Triangles profit margins have declined by 55%, while manpower costs have risen by 133% as a proportion of revenue.\n\n",

Key elements include a closed-circuit television for recording the survivors statement and an intermediary who assists and guides the survivor throughout the court process.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, 22 regional courts serve as VFCs.\n\nUNICEF, with support from Sweden through the Child Protection Fund, the EU via the Spotlight Initiative, and various other donors, has been instrumental in setting up and operating VFCs in the country for the past decade.\n\nGwaunza also acknowledged the active participation of other stakeholders in fostering an environment where justice could flourish, particularly in the rollout of the Integrated Electronic Case Management System (IECMS) in the upper courts.\n\nAs expected with a project of such national significance, challenges arose, but through cooperation and resilience, we overcame them.\n\nOver time, public confidence in the IECMS has grown, and more litigants now rely on the system. Stakeholders are therefore encouraged to maintain this positive momentum as we expand the IECMS to the busiest courts, the magistrates courts, she explained.\n\nGwaunza emphasized that all JSC stakeholders will play a crucial role this year, aligning with the theme of building public confidence in the judiciary through multi-stakeholder participation.\n\n",

A second shows the emaciated figures of some miners who are still alive.\n\nA long-delayed rescue operation, that last week a court ordered the government to facilitate, is continuing for a second day after beginning on Monday.\n\nLast year, arguing that the miners had entered the shaft in Stilfontein deliberately without permission, the authorities took a hard line, blocking food and water supplies.\n\nIn November, one government minister said: We are going to smoke them out.\n\nMore than 100 of the illegal miners, known locally as zama zamas, have reportedly died underground since the crack down began at the mine some 145km (90 miles) south-west of Johannesburg.\n\nThe authorities however, have not confirmed this figure as it is yet to be verified by an official source, a spokesperson told the BBC.\n\nHundreds are thought to be still in the mine while more than 1,000 have surfaced in the past few months.\n\nIn one of the videos released by a trade union, the General Industries Workers of South Africa (Giwusa), dozens of shirtless men can be seen sitting on a dirty floor. Their faces have been blurred. A male voice off camera can be heard saying that the men are hungry and need help.\n\nWere starting to show you the bodies of those who died underground, he says.\n\nAnd this is not all of them Do you see how people are struggling? Please we need help.\n\nIn the other video, a man says: This is hunger; people are dying because of hunger. He then puts the death toll at 96 and begs for help, food and supplies.\n\nThe union says the footage was filmed on Saturday.\n\nIn a briefing held on Monday near the site of the rescue operation, Giwusa leadership, alongside community figures, said the videos shared painted a very dire picture of the situation underground.\n\nWhat has transpired here has to be called what it is; this is a Stilfontein massacre. Because what this footage does is show a pile of human bodies, of miners that died needlessly, Giwusa president Mametlwe Sebei said.\n\nHe blamed the authorities for what he described as a treacherous policy that was deliberately pursued.\n\nThe department of mineral resources, leading the rescue effort, told the BBC that Mondays operation included lowering down a cage that is then hoisted up once loaded with people.\n\nThis structure is designed to hold six or seven people, depending on their weight, according to Giwusa. It has been going down the shaft  descending about 2km  every hour. The union said that by the end of Monday 26 miners had been brought up alive, along with nine bodies.\n\nDepartment of mineral resources spokesperson Makhosonke Buthelezi could not confirm whether the priority will be to retrieve those who had died or those in need of medical attention.\n\nA briefing will be held by the department, together with the police ministry, on Tuesday to provide an update on the operation.\n\n",

Firstly money was not circulating as it should,making it difficult to have proper preparations for the children, said Chitemere.\n\nHarare was a hive of activity Monday as parents made last-minute preparations for the reopening of schools.\n\nStationery and uniform shops were abuzz with parents making a beeline, and some taking advantage to make a killing by hiking the prices of school necessities.\n\nWith big supermarkets short on some goods, many resorted to informal shops in the downtown Harare Central Business Districts to purchase vital school materials.\n\nThe financial strain on some was exacerbated by the just-ended festive season which hit hard the pockets of many.\n\nOne parent identified as Chirisamhuru said the reopening of schools has left him breathing through the wound.\n\nPreparations were not easy. It started during the festive period when we also spent the little that we had. We have sacrificed for my children with one in form six and another one in form two. Essentials were a bit expensive but we did not have an option but to purchase, said Chisiyamhuru.\n\nAs the new yearbegins, Zimbabwes economy continues to tank, picking up where it left in 2024.\n\nAt the heart of the meltdown is the underperforming local currency, Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG), which was introduced nine months ago in an attempt to stabilise the faltering economy.\n\nHowever, ZiG has continued to lose valueagainst the United States dollar with many preferring to transact in the US dollar.\n\nSchools have not been immune to the economic pressures, as many now demand tuition fees in US dollars.\n\nChirisamhuru said the shunning of ZiG by many shops left many, like him,who earn in the local currency in a dilemma.\n\nWe had to reach an agreement with the school to allow kids to go to school after paying a part of the fees and then pay the remaining later. I do not even know ZiG. It is scarce I do not know why maybe it is circulating at RBZ and we are working with what is being demanded, he said.\n\n",
