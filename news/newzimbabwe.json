            "content": "ByElmond Bandauko, The Conversation\n\nThe informal sector hasbecome a dominant source of livelihoodsfor urban residents in African cities. Within this sector, street trading is one of the most visible and vital components of urban economies.\n\nIn Zimbabwes capital city, too, street traders, selling clothing, snacks, fruits and vegetables, household goods, electronics and many other products, are a dominant feature in the economy. As in most African cities, the majority of Harares traders operate without licences, and they are often victims of municipal raids and displacements. Yet, despite this hostile environment, street trading continues to flourish.\n\nHow do traders organise themselves in such a difficult setting? Who decides who sells where? And how is order maintained in a space where the states control is weak or repressive?\n\nI am an urbangeographerwhose work focuses onurban informalityand governance in African cities. These questions are at the heart of astudythat was part of my doctoral research onurban governance and the spatial politics of street traders in Harare. I am especially interested in how the urban poor wield their individual and collective agency to challenge urban exclusion.\n\nDrawing on interviews and focus groups with traders in Harares central business district, the research explores the invisible systems of informal governance that regulate access to trading spaces. The study shows that street trading is structured by its own internal rules, norms and power relations.\n\nInformality is not the absence of order. It is a different kind of order, rooted in everyday negotiation, social trust, and the shared struggle to survive in an unequal city.\n\nI concluded that city authorities and others should recognise that these informal governance systems are legitimate, and can even be useful when it comes to formalising activities in the city. Ignoring them could lead to conflict and deeper inequalities.\n\nZimbabwes economy as a whole has been unstable over the past four decades. As a result, the informal economy has become very important. The relationship between urban authorities and street traders has always beenantagonistic, however. That conflict has been the focus of most of the research on street trading. Harares city officials, like those in many other African cities, often treat traders as illegal, criminal, or a threat tomodern urban order.\n\nMy research takes a different view: I shift attention away from state repression to the everyday systems of organisation and control that traders themselves have developed.\n\nI conducted 19 semi-structured interviews and three focus groups with traders, to learn about their individual strategies and shared social mechanisms for keeping order on the streets.\n\nTraders in Harare use informal governance mechanisms  unwritten rules, social norms and personal relationships  to decide who can occupy which space, for how long, and under what conditions. These community-based systems are built on mutual recognition and trust, but also shaped by hierarchy, gender and seniority.\n\nThe interviews reveal that the most important rule for maintaining order is consistency. Traders often stay in the same spot for years  sometimes decades  to build customer loyalty and to assert their informal claim.\n\nAs one vendor explained:\n\nI stay in the same spot so that people always know where to find me  When everyone sticks to their usual place, it reduces disputes.\n\nThis practice, described by another scholar, Asef Bayat, as quiet encroachment, involves small, everyday acts of claiming space without formal permission. Over time, these acts become socially recognised by other traders and even by local residents or shopkeepers. If a new vendor tries to take over someones space, existing traders usually intervene before conflict escalates.\n\nAs one woman put it:\n\nNo one can just occupy the space without our permission.\n\nThis peer-enforced control system maintains order but also reinforces informal hierarchies.\n\nAlthough there are no official leaders, senior traders  those with long experience or strong social influence  often act as custodians of space. They mediate disputes, mentor newcomers and enforce unspoken rules.\n\nNew entrants typically undergo an informal street apprenticeship, during which they learn how to operate, when to display goods, how to evade municipal police, and whom to approach for protection. Newcomers cannot simply choose a spot and start selling. They must seek the approval of those already established. This process reflects an internalised authority system rooted in social norms rather than written law.\n\nThe study also uncovers how social capital  networks of trust, kinship and friendship  plays a central role in accessing space.\n\nMany traders gain their first selling spot through relatives or friends who are already part of the informal economy. In this way, street trading becomes an intergenerational practice, often inherited from parents or grandparents.\n\nOne participant explained that her grandmother had traded in the same area for decades, and when she lost her formal job, she joined the family business. Others said they felt morally obliged to reserve a deceased vendors spot for their children or relatives.\n\nHowever, these systems are not equal or fair. Power among traders is unevenly distributed. Long-term vendors and those with strong social connections often dominate lucrative areas, while newcomers (especially young people, women and persons with disabilities) struggle to gain a foothold.\n\nFor example, male traders often control spots near busy transport hubs, which are more profitable but also riskier. Women, who are concerned about safety or need to balance caregiving duties, tend to occupy less visible areas. One visually impaired trader said he relied on others to protect his spot, showing how trust and vulnerability shape spatial access.\n\nThere are also reports of traders using aggressive tactics to defend their territory. Some long-time vendors admitted to chasing away new sellers or even tipping off municipal officers to get competitors arrested. These practices reveal how informal governance can both protect livelihoods and reproduce exclusion.\n\nMy study shows that power in Harares informal economy is not only top-down, from the state to the traders, but also horizontal, negotiated among the traders themselves.\n\nThose with seniority or strong networks act as gatekeepers, deciding who can sell where. Women traders often face verbal or physical harassment from male counterparts but also develop their own strategies of resistance: confronting aggressors, forming alliances, or using moral arguments about fairness to defend their right to trade. These acts of quiet defiance demonstrate that informal governance is a site of both control and agency.\n\nWhat emerges from this research is a more nuanced picture of Harares informal economy. Street traders are not simply victims of a repressive state or chaotic actors in an unregulated market. They are also self-organising agents who build complex systems of order, reciprocity and social regulation in the absence of formal protection.\n\nAt the same time, these systems are not utopian. They involve competition, hierarchy and exclusion. Informal governance is both a survival mechanism and a structure of power.\n\nUnderstanding this duality is crucial for policymakers who wish to design fairer urban policies.\n\nAssistant Professor of Human Geography, University of Alberta\n\nThis article was originally published byThe Conversation.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nCongolese refugee and businessman Desire Nsengimana has lodged a formal complaint with the Zimbabwe Independent Complaints Commission (ZICC), accusing State security and immigration officials of harassment and unlawful detention amid intensifying tuckshop wars in downtown Harare.\n\nIn a letter by his lawyers, Rubaya and Chatambudza Legal Practitioners, gleaned by NewZimbabwe.com, Nsengimana alleges that members of the security sector are working with rival foreign traders who are weaponising gossip to eliminate competition through deportations and arrests.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Nsengimana has been held at Harare Remand Prison since June after he was allegedly kidnapped by men claiming to be Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) agents.\n\nHe says the agents branded him an enemy of the State and falsely accused him of being part of Rwandas National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS).\n\nOn or about the 10th of June 2025, our client was kidnapped by a contingent of individuals who he claims presented themselves as members of the Central Intelligence Organisation, whom, if given the chance, he is capable of identifying, reads part of the letter dated November 7 and addressed to the ZICC Executive Secretary.\n\nHis captors communicated the spurious allegations against him. They threatened and ordered him to leave Zimbabwe, having been falsely branded an enemy of the State.\n\nThe letter adds: This designation was based on the unsubstantiated claim that he is an operative of Rwandas National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS), allegedly deployed to target Rwandan refugees who settled in Zimbabwe post 1994.\n\nNsengimana insists he is a legitimate refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo, lawfully residing in Zimbabwe since 2014, and has no links to Rwandan intelligence.\n\nHe alleges that he told the alleged CIO agents that certain Rwandan refugees who settled in Zimbabwe just after the 1994 Rwandan genocide were the ones who were just seeing shadows and were on a frolic of their own, giving the security agents in Zimbabwe false information for purposes of weeding out of Zimbabwe other refugees like Desire Nsengimana who they regarded as threats in business circles, the letter states.\n\nHis lawyers further argue that there was nothing to the allegations as it was a simple case of jealousy and rivalry wherein his detractors sought and still seek to equate his business acumen with state sponsorship.\n\nFollowing the alleged abduction, Nsengimana was reportedly handed over to Immigration Compliance Officer Machona, who ordered him to report to the Immigration Department the following day.\n\nSubsequent to his kidnapping, he was then handed over to one Immigration Compliance Officer Machona who then instructed him to visit the Immigration Department Offices the next day, the 11th of June 2025. He was then advised by Machona that he was going to be detained at Harare Remand Prison as a prohibited person for deportation to Rwanda, the lawyers said.\n\nThe letter further claims that Machona advised him that his arrest and subsequent detention was not up to the Immigration Department, but some powerful members of the Central Intelligence Organisation connected to a clique of refugees from Rwanda. Mr. Nsengimana was perplexed by such abuse of State apparatus in the name of State Security, yet he is not even a danger to the Republic of Zimbabwe.\n\nNsengimana is now appealing to the ZICC to investigate the alleged abuse of authority by State and immigration officials, which he believes is being driven by jealousy and commercial rivalry among refugee business operators in Harare.\n\n",

It should not have awarded damages in addition to back pay and benefits, as this resulted in double compensation, said Justice Mwayera in the judgment.\n\nThe case stemmed from a long-running employment dispute between the state-linked petroleum firm and its former senior executive, who was dismissed in 2019 after being found guilty of misconduct.\n\nHis dismissal was later quashed by the Supreme Court in May 2023, which ordered reinstatement or damages in lieu of reinstatement if reinstatement proved untenable.\n\nWhen Petrozim declined to take him back, the Labour Court ordered the company to pay him over US$818,000, broken down into US$608,535 in back pay and benefits and US$210,263.52 in damages, plus a company vehicle, leave pay and pension contributions.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court found the lower courts assessment inconsistent with settled law, saying it failed to properly apply the principle of mitigation of loss, which limits compensation to the period an employee would reasonably take to find new employment.\n\nAn employee who has been dismissed, whether lawfully or unlawfully, is not entitled to sit around and do nothing. He must mitigate his damages by looking for and taking temporary employment when available, Justice Mwayera said, citing earlier rulings.\n\nThe apex court further ruled that the Labour Court erred by issuing a non-monetary order directing Petrozim to sell its vehicle to Manyenga without determining its value or considering the companys internal policy.\n\nIt is trite that once a court finds reinstatement untenable and proceeds to award damages, the resultant order must be sounding in money, the judgment stressed.\n\nThe Supreme Court therefore set aside several paragraphs of the Labour Courts judgmentincluding those relating to additional damages, interest, vehicle sale, and pension contributions and remitted the case for a fresh assessment of damages in line with Petrozims vehicle policy.\n\nIn a partial victory for Manyenga, the Supreme Court upheld his cross-appeal, directing that he be paid an enhanced amount of US$734,994.16 in back pay and benefits, which includes an additional US$126,459.16 in contractual entitlements such as professional subscriptions and allowances initially excluded by the Labour Court.\n\nEach party was ordered to bear its own costs.\n\n",
