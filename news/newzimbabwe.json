            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nROBERT Tinotenda Mugabe, son of the late former president Robert Gabriel Mugabe, was on Friday granted US$300 bail after spending two nights in custody on allegations of unlawful possession of dagga.Magistrate Lisa Mutendereki ordered Mugabe Jr to report once every Friday at the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) Drugs and Narcotics unit, reside at his Borrowdale address until the case is finalised, and return to court on October 22.Mugabe (33) was arrested on Wednesday during a police traffic blitz after he drove against a one-way street along 2nd Street Extension in Harare in a silver Honda Fit, registration number AGY 5850.Upon searching the accuseds black sling bag, police officers recovered two sachets of dagga, one pack of rizla, and a white dagga crusher, prosecutor Mandirasa Chigumira told the court.The court heard that Mugabe refused to sign the police seizure receipt. The recovered dagga was weighed at Harare Main Post, confirming a total of two grammes with a street value of US$30.The seized dagga can be tendered in court as an exhibit, Chigumira added, arguing that the accused acted unlawfully and initially urging the court to deny him immediate release.Mugabe, who resides in the upmarket Borrowdale neighbourhood, and is currently unemployed, is represented by lawyer Ashiel Mugiya.Meanwhile, in a separate case, Phillip Munetsi Chiyangwa (26), son of flamboyant businessman Phillip Chiyangwa, was also granted bail after being charged with unlawful possession of drugs.Chiyangwa is jointly charged with Tanaka Phil Kashambe (25).

We are talking of something that is unconstitutional, and the multitudes and the power of Zimbabweans will only lead to endorse what is constitutional. We are not going to be held hostage by a few individuals, said Fambi.\n\nIn its plot to extend Mnangagwas tenure, Zanu PF is hoping to take advantage of the opposition, which is in disarray.\n\nHowever, the bid has ignited factionalism within the ruling party, with one side emerging to resist the plan and back Mnangagwas deputy, Constantino Chiwenga, to succeed him.\n\nSeveral politicians including Tendai Biti have also vowed to fight Zanu PFs tenure extension.\n\nIn a political landscape that has a plethora of opposition parties, NPD deputy leader Kumbirayi Chenhare said they have the wherewithal to challenge Zanu PFs hegemony.\n\nWe are from the people, by the people, so our strength lies in the masses. Therefore, we will be well-funded and accepted, said Chenhare.\n\n",
