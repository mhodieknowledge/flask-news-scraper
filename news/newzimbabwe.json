            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nZIMBABWES largest referral hospital, Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, is operating with just a single Intensive Care Unit (ICU) catering for patients from various wards at institution.\n\nThis is happening at a time when around 4,500 children are born yearly with congenital heart defects that require open heart surgery while the nation has a waiting list of up to 600 adults suffering from rheumatic heart disease, who also need to undergo the same procedure.In addition, the hospital, which handles critical medical cases from across the country, lacks a dedicated cardiothoracic ICU, severely limiting its capacity to perform life saving surgeries on a regular basis.Besides patients requiring open heart surgeries, all other life-threatening illnesses are dealt with in the same single ICU.Speaking to NewZimbabwe.com, specialist cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon Dr. Simukayi Machawira bemoaned lack of trained personnel and resources saying they were limiting the rate at which the life-saving surgeries must be done.At the moment at Parirenyatwa we just have one ICU that addresses the whole hospital, not just cardiothoracic.Ideally, we should have an independent cardiothoracic ICU with 10 beds, then that way we can operate everyday without any impediment.So, this is what we are working towards, we want a fully functional unit, Machawira said.The situation is further worsened by a dire shortage of specialised staff, with the hospital currently relying on only one trained perfusionist, a critical member of the surgical team responsible for operating heart-lung machines during open-heart procedures.We still have one perfusionist, I am happy to say we have secured training for two perfusionists in Tanzania, hopefully we will get a training opportunity for another one in Kenya. Once we have five or six we will be able to embark on a larger programme and also train our own perfusionists locally, Machawira said.From June 2023 to date, Parirenyatwa Hospital has performed around 55 open heart surgeries.The situation at the referral hospital reflects the state of all public health institutions in Zimbabwe, if not worse and these are the hospitals on which poor people rely.President Emmerson Mnangagwas government has long neglected general hospitals, which now face crumbling infrastructure, shortages of equipment and medicines, and a critical staff shortage due to brain drain occasioned by meagre salaries and poor working conditions.\n\nThis is happening at a time when around 4,500 children are born yearly with congenital heart defects that require open heart surgery while the nation has a waiting list of up to 600 adults suffering from rheumatic heart disease, who also need to undergo the same procedure.\n\nIn addition, the hospital, which handles critical medical cases from across the country, lacks a dedicated cardiothoracic ICU, severely limiting its capacity to perform life saving surgeries on a regular basis.Besides patients requiring open heart surgeries, all other life-threatening illnesses are dealt with in the same single ICU.Speaking to NewZimbabwe.com, specialist cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon Dr. Simukayi Machawira bemoaned lack of trained personnel and resources saying they were limiting the rate at which the life-saving surgeries must be done.At the moment at Parirenyatwa we just have one ICU that addresses the whole hospital, not just cardiothoracic.Ideally, we should have an independent cardiothoracic ICU with 10 beds, then that way we can operate everyday without any impediment.So, this is what we are working towards, we want a fully functional unit, Machawira said.The situation is further worsened by a dire shortage of specialised staff, with the hospital currently relying on only one trained perfusionist, a critical member of the surgical team responsible for operating heart-lung machines during open-heart procedures.We still have one perfusionist, I am happy to say we have secured training for two perfusionists in Tanzania, hopefully we will get a training opportunity for another one in Kenya.

            "content": "By Daily Maverick\n\nRECENT demonstrations against foreign nationals at public healthcare facilities have intensified arguments that taxpayer-funded institutions, already overstretched, are being unfairly used.Though these concerns are not entirely unfounded, as South Africa provides constitutionally protected healthcare to all inside its borders, the demonstrations reveal a deeper systemic issue in our public healthcare system.South Africas relative stability positions it as a migration destination for the citizens of many neighbouring countries, having a significant impact on border healthcare facilities. Combined with the legacy of apartheid-era health infrastructure, the attention given to foreign nationals often becomes a distraction from deeper systemic issues.The reality is that healthcare infrastructure has persistently lagged behind demand and population growth, irrespective of nationality. Many border-area hospitals face heightened pressure, not primarily from migration, but rather from longstanding underinvestment in capacity and resources.South Africas healthcare expenditureAbout 8% of South Africas GDP is dedicated to healthcare, translating to about R10,000 per person annually. This expenditure includes both public and private healthcare sectors.Its about one-tenth that of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, but similar to regional neighbours such as Namibia, which spends about R8,000 per person.However, raw spending figures mean little without outcome comparisons using metrics such as life expectancy, which in South Africa is slightly higher than in Namibia or Botswana.But Professor Alex van den Heever, chair in the field of social security systems administration and management studies at Wits University, says life expectancy is too broad as a metric.Look at maternal mortality, he suggested.Maternal mortality statistics highlight healthcare governance and management shortcomings, suggesting that the primary issue is not hospitals being overrun by foreign nationals.Despite having a substantial public healthcare system, South Africa has one of the highest rates of private medical insurance globally, covering about 16% of the population, according to the Council for Medical Schemes. This starkly underscores disparities in healthcare access and spending in the country.An average patient-day equivalent in a public hospital costs about R3,700 to R4,000, according to the National Treasurys 2023 Budget Review. This figure represents the total cost of providing care for one patient for one full day, encompassing all associated expenses such as staffing, medication and supplies. Notably, 64% of this cost goes to wages.Van den Heever emphasises that despite significant wage increases since 2007, staffing levels have remained largely static, highlighting inefficiencies in resource allocation. Specific treatment costs underline this: a Caesarean section ranges from R18,000 to R22,000; tuberculosis treatment costs between R6,000 and R8,000; and antiretroviral treatment averages between R3,000 and R4,000 annually per patient.The numbers paint a bleak picture of what is being spent per person annually, and they fail to demonstrate the human cost and distress caused to those denied access to care.Janet*, a Zimbabwean who has been living in South Africa for more than a decade with a valid Zimbabwean Exemption Permit, described the challenges she faced.They [the hospital staff] said, Why are you here? Because youre a foreigner you must pay a certain amount  if you dont pay, they wont treat you.The interaction occurred when Janet was seven months pregnant and went to Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital in Johannesburg for a routine checkup.They insulted me. They said I must pay because Im a foreigner. They didnt want to check my ID or see my papers. They just said if I dont pay, I must go home, Janet said, noting that many other people in her community  legally in South Africa from Zimbabwe  have faced similar challenges.She stopped going to her appointments in the run-up to giving birth.They told me to pay R470 every week. I couldnt afford it, so I just stopped going.She only returned when it was time to give birth.A 2023 Health Ombud investigative report found that 40% of patients admitted at the Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital were foreign nationals (although the investigation did not stipulate whether they were documented or undocumented).Despite these significant numbers, there remains no mechanism for cross-border billing. The existing Southern African Development Community protocol addresses disease outbreaks, but it excludes routine healthcare services.No data system exists to raise an account [] The issue has drifted for 50 years, Van den Heever confirmed.Fixing the systemDespite severe criticism and resistance from some quarters, including over its costs and funding, the government is pressing ahead with the National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme.The Department of Healths spokesperson, Foster Mohale, confirms that NHI implementation is in its initial phase, focused on foundational, institutional and organisational arrangements.The NHI implementation is going well with phase 1 (20232026) under way, establishing foundational structures including the NHI Fund, Mohale said.Phase 1 provides for ministerial advisory committees focusing on healthcare benefits and health technology assessment, which should be complete by July 2025.Mohale said the department has also rolled out a supply chain management and payment checklist, pre- and post-audits, and a CFO forum to tighten procurement controls and reduce irregular spending.The NHI alone might not bring the redress needed, but foreign nationals using South Africas healthcare system is not the core challenge either. Hospital beds were already underfunded and overstretched long before border crossings increased.The Auditor-General flagged about R1.8-billion as fruitless expenditure in the 2022/23 financial year, a sum significantly greater than any healthcare costs directly attributable to foreign nationals.Van den Heever noted: Its cyclical  foreign nationals are the bogeyman every election.Structural inefficiencies mean longer wait times and diminished healthcare quality for the average South African patient. They wait longer for beds, or forever  but its not because those beds are being occupied by others. The core issues lie in systemic inefficiencies, inadequate infrastructure investment and weak governance.Effectively fixing South Africas healthcare system means fixing its management and money first. Migration and foreign nationals are an easy target, especially during election season, but theyre not the real reason people lie waiting for treatment in hospital corridors. Without real improvements in governance, finance and basic infrastructure, the promise stays a promise.Surname has been withheld.\n\nRECENT demonstrations against foreign nationals at public healthcare facilities have intensified arguments that taxpayer-funded institutions, already overstretched, are being unfairly used.\n\nThough these concerns are not entirely unfounded, as South Africa provides constitutionally protected healthcare to all inside its borders, the demonstrations reveal a deeper systemic issue in our public healthcare system.South Africas relative stability positions it as a migration destination for the citizens of many neighbouring countries, having a significant impact on border healthcare facilities.

This starkly underscores disparities in healthcare access and spending in the country.An average patient-day equivalent in a public hospital costs about R3,700 to R4,000, according to the National Treasurys 2023 Budget Review. This figure represents the total cost of providing care for one patient for one full day, encompassing all associated expenses such as staffing, medication and supplies. Notably, 64% of this cost goes to wages.Van den Heever emphasises that despite significant wage increases since 2007, staffing levels have remained largely static, highlighting inefficiencies in resource allocation. Specific treatment costs underline this: a Caesarean section ranges from R18,000 to R22,000; tuberculosis treatment costs between R6,000 and R8,000; and antiretroviral treatment averages between R3,000 and R4,000 annually per patient.The numbers paint a bleak picture of what is being spent per person annually, and they fail to demonstrate the human cost and distress caused to those denied access to care.Janet*, a Zimbabwean who has been living in South Africa for more than a decade with a valid Zimbabwean Exemption Permit, described the challenges she faced.They [the hospital staff] said, Why are you here? Because youre a foreigner you must pay a certain amount  if you dont pay, they wont treat you.The interaction occurred when Janet was seven months pregnant and went to Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital in Johannesburg for a routine checkup.They insulted me. They said I must pay because Im a foreigner. They didnt want to check my ID or see my papers. They just said if I dont pay, I must go home, Janet said, noting that many other people in her community  legally in South Africa from Zimbabwe  have faced similar challenges.She stopped going to her appointments in the run-up to giving birth.They told me to pay R470 every week. I couldnt afford it, so I just stopped going.She only returned when it was time to give birth.A 2023 Health Ombud investigative report found that 40% of patients admitted at the Rahima Moosa Mother and Child Hospital were foreign nationals (although the investigation did not stipulate whether they were documented or undocumented).Despite these significant numbers, there remains no mechanism for cross-border billing. The existing Southern African Development Community protocol addresses disease outbreaks, but it excludes routine healthcare services.No data system exists to raise an account [] The issue has drifted for 50 years, Van den Heever confirmed.Fixing the systemDespite severe criticism and resistance from some quarters, including over its costs and funding, the government is pressing ahead with the National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme.The Department of Healths spokesperson, Foster Mohale, confirms that NHI implementation is in its initial phase, focused on foundational, institutional and organisational arrangements.The NHI implementation is going well with phase 1 (20232026) under way, establishing foundational structures including the NHI Fund, Mohale said.Phase 1 provides for ministerial advisory committees focusing on healthcare benefits and health technology assessment, which should be complete by July 2025.Mohale said the department has also rolled out a supply chain management and payment checklist, pre- and post-audits, and a CFO forum to tighten procurement controls and reduce irregular spending.The NHI alone might not bring the redress needed, but foreign nationals using South Africas healthcare system is not the core challenge either. Hospital beds were already underfunded and overstretched long before border crossings increased.The Auditor-General flagged about R1.8-billion as fruitless expenditure in the 2022/23 financial year, a sum significantly greater than any healthcare costs directly attributable to foreign nationals.Van den Heever noted: Its cyclical  foreign nationals are the bogeyman every election.Structural inefficiencies mean longer wait times and diminished healthcare quality for the average South African patient. They wait longer for beds, or forever  but its not because those beds are being occupied by others. The core issues lie in systemic inefficiencies, inadequate infrastructure investment and weak governance.Effectively fixing South Africas healthcare system means fixing its management and money first. Migration and foreign nationals are an easy target, especially during election season, but theyre not the real reason people lie waiting for treatment in hospital corridors. Without real improvements in governance, finance and basic infrastructure, the promise stays a promise.Surname has been withheld.\n\nSouth Africas relative stability positions it as a migration destination for the citizens of many neighbouring countries, having a significant impact on border healthcare facilities. Combined with the legacy of apartheid-era health infrastructure, the attention given to foreign nationals often becomes a distraction from deeper systemic issues.\n\nThe reality is that healthcare infrastructure has persistently lagged behind demand and population growth, irrespective of nationality.

I worked with people who inspire me and who represent the sound of now. BabMotha is my way of giving back to the culture and to the fans who keep pushing this movement forward.The title BabMotha is a clear nod to Kabzas leadership role in the genre, reflecting his commitment to elevating not just his own sound but that of the entire amapiano movement through consistent collaboration and innovation.With months of build-up and speculation, BabMotha is easily one of the most eagerly awaited South African music releases of the year.And with his unmatched ability to fuse street-level authenticity with international appeal, Kabza De Small has delivered yet another masterpiece.\n\nWidely regarded as the king of amapiano, Kabza is once again flexing his musical prowess with a project that blends star-studded collaborations, signature soulful beats and an expansive take on the ever-evolving genre.\n\nBabMotha features some of the most recognisable names in amapiano, including Young Stunna, Nkosazana Daughter, Nobuhle, Sykes, DJ Maphorisa, Dlala Thukzin, Da Muziqal Chef, Kelvin Momo, Mdu aka TRP, Tracy and Thatohatsi, to name a few.Leading the rollout was Kabza Chant 2.0, an anthemic track featuring Nobuhle, Nkosazana Daughter and Sykes that quickly became a fan favourite thanks to its rich production and emotionally resonant vocals.Another standout, Ngyozama, brings together Young Stunna, Nkosazana Daughter, Sykes, Tracy and Thatohatsi in a collaboration that underscores the genres emotional and sonic depth.Speaking to the inspiration behind the album, Kabza said: This album is about celebrating where amapiano has come from and where we are going.
