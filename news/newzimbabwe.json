            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nAXED Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) Commissioner-General, Godwin Matanga, was this Thursday reportedly spotted in full uniform despite having been officially retired.\n\nThe development sparked debate amid rumour that the former police boss was refusing to leave office citing reasons that he was not formally served with his retirement papers.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa, for unknown reasons, retired Matanga starting January 1, 2025. Deputy Police Commissioner-General, Stephen Mutamba, was elevated to take over reins at Police General Headquarters (PGHQ).\n\nAn organisation claiming to represent children of war veterans has made sensational allegations that Matanga reported at his Harare offices and defended his move saying he was yet to receive official communication of his marching orders.\n\nMatanga reported to his office today in full police uniform. His argument is that he was not served with a letter of dismissal, he only saw the letter on social media, said COZWA.\n\nCOZWA proceeded to make sensational claims that the polices Support Unit, Alpha Troop had been put on standby to forcibly remove him from office.\n\nNational police spokesperson, Commissioner Paul Nyathi was not picking calls when NewZimbabwe.com reached out to him inorder to shed light on the matter.\n\nHowever, an invitation from Nyathis office calling on journalists to attend a handover-and-takeover ceremony on January 3, 2025, circulated Thursday, seemingly conveniently timed to diffuse reports of the unfolding drama at PGHQ. The historic event will take place at Mukushi Depot, formerly Morris Depot this Friday.\n\nMatanga took over from Augustine Chihuri, who fled the country after the November 2017 coup that toppled late President Robert Mugabe before President Emmerson Mnangagwa assumed office.\n\nChihuri was perceived to have been a member of Zanu PFs losing G40 faction whose members also fled and are now scattered across the region.\n\n",

At one point, it had one of the highest lion population densities in Africa, according to African Parks.\n\nMurombedzi said the boy used his knowledge of the wild and survival skills to stay alive.\n\nTinotenda survived his ordeal by eating wild fruit. He also dug small wells into dry riverbeds with a stick to access drinking water  a skill taught in the drought-prone area.\n\nMembers of the local Nyaminyami community started a search party and beat drums each day to try and guide him back home.\n\nBut ultimately, it was park rangers who managed to find him.\n\nOn his fifth day in the wild, Tinotenda heard a rangers car and ran toward it, narrowly missing it, the MP said.\n\nLuckily, the rangers returned, spotted fresh little human footprints, and searched the area until they found him.\n\nThis was probably his last chance of being rescued after 5 days in the wilderness, said the MP.\n\nThe park is over 1,470 sq km (570 sq miles) and is home to zebras, elephants, hippos, lions and antelope.\n\nAcross social media, people have been praising the young boy for his resilience.\n\nThis is beyond human comprehension, one person wrote on X.\n\nAnother user wrote: Hes going to have one hell of a story to tell when he gets back to school.\n\n",

            "content": "By James Muonwa l Mashonaland West Correspondent\n\nAMID a worsening electricity deficit that has resulted in average households experiencing 18-hour blackouts, the need for alternative energy sources cannot be overemphasized.\n\nAfter realising the efficacy of accelerating the deployment of solar plants to the countrys energy mix, stakeholders in the insurance and pensions industry have invested in a solar power project located in Mashonaland West province, which has confirmed its status as not only the breadbasket of Zimbabwe, but the energy basket as well.\n\nAlready, the province is home to the countrys foremost hydroelectricity generation plant at Kariba.\n\nNow, through significant investment by the National Social Security Authority (NSSA) and Old Mutual Limited life has been breathed into a new solar power plant called Centragrid Nyabira Solar PV Park.\n\nThe independent power producer is licensed to own, finance, construct, and operate a 25MW solar power plant and its associated transmission facilities at Nyabira.\n\nNSSA and pan-African financial services group Old Mutual put a combined investment of $30 million in the solar power project.\n\nIt is, therefore, a refreshing reality that the pensions and insurance industry is contributing significantly towards the countrys socio-economic growth with players embarking on the transformative infrastructural development sitting on 50 hectares of land.\n\nMinister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution for Mashonaland West, Marian Chombo hailed the milestone infrastructural development that consolidates the provinces tag as a power house.\n\nMashonaland West is a power-producing province, and we have set the conditions for investors to come and invest in the energy sector. We need to produce more power to meet our energy needs, said Chombo.\n\nThere is still scope for more projects to ensure Zimbabwe has adequate energy for domestic consumption and surplus for export. We are particularly impressed by the solar power plant in our province.\n\nThe expansion of the solar farm and its associated transmission facilities followed an impact investment strategy of Old Mutual Limited and NSSA that was announced in December 2021.\n\nThe power plant is located at the 35km mark along the Harare-Chirundu highway, and it is now feeding into the grid, thanks to local pension fund, NSSA, as well as the investment arms of Old Mutual for helping make the project a reality. It is now the second largest utility-scale plant in Zimbabwe.\n\nCentragrid plant manager, Engineer Tariro Muka said the power from the solar panels feeds into the national grid through the 88KV Norton to Mazowe powerline, reiterating the need to embrace clean energy.\n\nConsidering issues of global warming and climate change, it is important for us to go green. That will be a significant step in reducing global warming, said Muka.\n\nEnergy expert, Munashe Ngwerume told NewZimbabwe.com that locally-funded solar power plants could help alleviate the countrys electricity generation shortfall in a short space of time.\n\nSolar plants of this size can be built fairly quickly and can be up and running in under a year. The biggest challenge experienced by independent power producers in Zimbabwe is lack of funding.\n\nWith foreign funding having proven to be difficult to secure for most developers for over a decade due to several factors, including the countrys high risk profile, a locally-funded model based on the learnings from Centragrids first 25MW plant as well as the government putting its own resources into the mix as it did with the accelerated road rehabilitation project, could change the game for local IPPs, said Ngwerume.\n\nAt current pricing, Ngwerume emphasised, going solar is attractive right now due to the incredible reduction in the price of solar panels.\n\nA 25MWp solar PV plant can now probably be constructed for about $20 million in this part of the world at current prices.\n\nThis cost includes all the development, permitting, and construction costs up to the Commercial Operation Date (COD)Zimbabwe has 10 provinces, they could even build one plant in each province for easier integration into the grid and also spread the solar love around the country equitably.\n\nAdding four of these 25MW plants to each province would get 1GWp of good installed nameplate solar capacity in a very short time.\n\nNgwerume said Zimbabwe needs cheaper, faster-to-build electricity generation plants hence the Centragrid solar PV project aligns with governments efforts in scaling up renewable energy capacity\n\nGovernment has targeted to generate 16.5% of total electricity or 1,100 MW from renewables by 2025, and 26.5 % of total generation or 2,100 MW from renewables by 2030.\n\nThe investment comes at a time when Zimbabwe faces a power deficit of around 600 MW to 700 MW, according to energy estimates by authorities. This deficit is due to severe climate changes that lowered the dam levels at the countrys largest electricity generation station, the Kariba South Hydro Power Plant.\n\nCentragrid founder and managing director, Victor Utedzi was recently quoted in the media expressing pride in the project, highlighting the importance of local investment in driving Africas energy future.\n\nThis flagship project stands as a testament to what can be accomplished by local investors in Africa in the pursuit of alleviating energy shortages, Utedzi said.\n\nThe Nyabira solar plant is one of the first IPPs to connect to Zimbabwes national grid, and its expansion further cements its role as a key player in the countrys renewable energy landscape. The increased capacity will contribute to the national grid, offering much-needed relief to Zimbabwes energy supply challenges.\n\nThe success of this project is seen as a model for other renewable energy initiatives across the country, with hopes that more locally funded projects will follow suit to reduce dependency on external capital and improve energy security.\n\nUtedzi said the project was critical to Zimbabwes intention to add about 4 000 MW of electricity by 2030, given the growing demand for electricity.\n\nHe acknowledged there is a lot of demand for electricity in new industries coming up, taking advantage of favourable investment conditions created by President Emmerson Mnangagwas government.\n\nMining, agricultural, manufacturing and tourism sectors are growing significantly and demand more electricity.\n\nSo, we need to add more electricity to this country and Centragrid is that first step of the large-scale renewable energy projects that are adding to electricity generation in Zimbabwe, said Utedzi.\n\nLiu Yachen, the Sinohydro project manager for the solar project said at the peak of the project, employed about 400 locals and about 10 Chinese experts.\n\n",
