It is common cause that Mr. Chigumbura has accepted numerous prominent positions in the Zimbabwe domestic cricket ecosystem.He is head coach of the Zimbabwe Under-19 team, head coach of Takashinga Cricket Club, and head of a private cricket developmental side operating under the name and style Elton Chigumbura Cricket Academy.These positions would reasonably give rise to issues of bias and disclosure of conflicts of interest demonstrated in player selection; especially where Mr. Chigumbura is put in a position to select players, and likely is prone to select those players with which he has prior connections or vested personal developmental interest, read the petition further.Madondo beseeched SRC to conduct an investigation into ZC and publicise a report of a 2023 inquiry, which was headed by Lloyd Mhishi.The Sports Recreation Commission Zimbabwe must conduct a comprehensive, independent, impartial and public investigation into the Zimbabwe Cricket selection processes with respect to allegations of nepotism, discrimination, tribalism, and regionalism in player selection.A detailed report be made public, with clear corrective recommendations.

The projected surplus will continue to be supported by improvements in merchandise exports and remittances, he said.\n\nThe MPS shows that the financial soundness metrics indicate that the banking sector is safe and sound despite some issues of prudential concern at a few institutions.\n\nAs at June 30, 2025, 17 out of 19 banking institutions reported core capital above the minimum regulatory capital requirements and the non-performing loans ratio stood at 2.89% compared to 3.37% as at 31 December 2024.\n\nOfficial records also show that during the same period, remittances rose to US$635,2 million signaling a 7,1% increase compared to the same period last year.\n\nTo year end, remittances are projected to increase by 4.9% from US$2.6 billion in 2024 to US$2.7 billion in 2025, sustaining a positive current account balance. Given the strategic importance of the diaspora community, the Government seeks to strengthen their role in the development of the country.\n\n",
