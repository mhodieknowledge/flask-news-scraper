            "content": "By Mark Wilberforce l BBC\n\nWHEN my mother told me at the age of 16 that we were going from the UK to Ghana for the summer holidays, I had no reason to doubt her.\n\nIt was just a quick trip, a temporary break  nothing to worry about. Or so I thought.\n\nOne month in, she dropped the bombshell  I was not coming back to London until I had reformed and had earned enough GCSEs to continue my education.\n\nI was hoodwinked in a similar way to the British-Ghanaian teenager who recently took his parents to the High Court in London for sending him to school in Ghana.\n\nIn their defence, they told the judge they did not want to see their 14-year-old son become yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London.\n\nBack in the mid-1990s, my mother, a primary school teacher, was motivated by similar concerns.\n\nI had been excluded from two high schools in the London Borough of Brent, hanging out with the wrong crowd (becoming the wrong crowd)  and heading down a dangerous path.\n\nMy closest friends at the time ended up in prison for armed robbery. Had I stayed in London, I would have almost certainly been convicted with them.\n\nBut being sent to Ghana also felt like a prison sentence.\n\nI can empathise to a degree with the teenager, who said in his court statement that he feels like he is living in hell.\n\nYet, speaking for myself, by the time I turned 21 I realised what my mother had done had been a blessing.\n\nUnlike the boy at the centre of the London court case  which he lost  I did not go to boarding school in Ghana.\n\nMy mother placed me in the care of her two closest brothers, they wanted to keep an eye on me, and it was felt that being around boarders could prove too much of a distraction.\n\nI first stayed with my Uncle Fiifi, a former UN environmentalist, in a town called Dansoman, near the capital, Accra.\n\nThe lifestyle change hit hard. In London, I had my own bedroom, access to washing machines and a sense of independence  even if I was using it recklessly.\n\nIn Ghana, I was waking up at 05:00 to sweep the courtyard and wash my uncles often muddy pick-up truck and my aunts car.\n\nIt was her vehicle that I would later steal  something of a watershed moment.\n\nI did not even know how to drive properly, treating a manual like an automatic and I crashed it into a high-ranking soldiers Mercedes.\n\nI tried to flee the scene. But that soldier caught me and threatened to take me to Burma Camp, the notorious military base where people had disappeared in the past.\n\nThat was the last truly reckless thing I did. It was not just discipline that I learnt in Ghana  it was perspective. Life in Ghana showed me how much I had taken for granted.\n\nWashing clothes by hand and preparing meals with my aunt made me appreciate the effort needed.\n\nFood, like everything in Ghana, required patience. There were no microwaves, no fast-food runs.\n\nMaking the traditional dough-like dish fufu, for example, is laborious and involves pounding cooked yams or cassava into a paste with a mortar.\n\nAt the time, it felt like punishment. Looking back, it was building resilience.\n\nInitially, my uncles considered placing me in high-end schools like the Ghana International School or SOS-Hermann Gmeiner International College.\n\nBut they were smart. They knew I might just form a new crew to cause chaos and mischief.\n\nInstead, I received private tuition at Accra Academy, a state secondary school that my late father had attended. It meant I was often taught on my own or in small groups.\n\nLessons were in English, but out of school those around me were often speaking local languages and I found it easy to pick them up perhaps because it was such an immersive experience.\n\nBack home in London, I used to love to learn swear words in my mothers Fante language  but was far from fluent.\n\nWhen I later moved to the city of Tema to stay with my favourite uncle, Uncle Jojo  an agricultural expert, I continued private tuition at Tema Secondary School.\n\nIn contrast to the boy making the headlines in the UK, who claimed Ghanas education system was not up to standard, I found it to be exacting.\n\nI was considered academically gifted in the UK, despite my troublesome ways, but actually found it tough going in Ghana. Students my age were far ahead in subjects like maths and science.\n\nThe rigour of the Ghanaian system pushed me to study harder than I ever had in London.\n\nThe result? I earned five GCSEs with grades C and above  something that once seemed impossible.\n\nBeyond academic achievements, Ghanaian society instilled values that have stayed with me for life.\n\nRespect for elders was non-negotiable. Throughout the neighbourhoods I lived in, you greeted those older than you, regardless of whether or not you knew them.\n\nGhana did not just make me more disciplined and respectful  it made me fearless.\n\nFootball played a huge part in that transformation. I played in the parks, which were often hard red clay with loose pebbles and stones, with two square goalposts fashioned out of wood and string.\n\nIt was a far cry from the neatly maintained pitches in England, but it toughened me up in ways I could not have imagined  and it is no wonder some of the greatest footballers seen in the English Premier League have come from West Africa.\n\nOn Sundays children and teenagers flock to Ghanas beaches to play football\n\nThe aggressive style played in Ghana was not just about skill  it was about resilience and endurance. Getting tackled on rough ground meant picking yourself up, dusting yourself off and carrying on.\n\nEvery Sunday, I played football on the beach  though I would often be late because there was absolutely no way either of my uncles would allow me to stay home instead of attending church.\n\nThose services felt like they lasted forever. But it was also a testament to Ghana as a God-fearing nation, where faith is deeply embedded in everyday life.\n\nThe first 18 months were the hardest. I resented the restrictions, the chores, the discipline.\n\nI even tried stealing my passport to fly back to London, but my mother was ahead of me and had hidden it well. There was no escape.\n\nMy only choice was to adapt. Somewhere along the way, I stopped seeing Ghana as a prison and started seeing it as happy home.\n\nI know of a few others like me who were sent back to Ghana by their parents living in London.\n\nMichael Adom was 17 when he arrived in Accra for school in the 1990s, describing his experience as bittersweet. He stayed until he was 23 and now lives back in London working as a probation officer.\n\nHis main complaint was the loneliness  he missed his family and friends. There were times of anger about his situation and the complications of feeling misunderstood.\n\nThis largely stemmed from the fact that his parents had not taught him or his siblings any of the local languages when growing up in London.\n\nI didnt understand Ga. I didnt understand Twi. I didnt understand Pidgin, the 49-year-old tells me.\n\nThis made him feel vulnerable for his first two-and-a-half years  and, he says, liable to being fleeced, for example, by those increasing prices because he seemed foreign.\n\nAnywhere I went, I had to make sure I went with somebody else, he says.\n\nBut he ended up becoming fluent in Twi and, overall, he believes the positives outweighed the negatives: It made me a man.\n\nMy Ghana experience matured me and changed me for the better, by helping me to identify with who I am, as a Ghanaian, and cemented my understanding of my culture, background and family history.\n\nPatience Wilberforce, a primary school teacher, was determined her son should leave school with qualifications\n\nI can concur with this. By my third year, I had fallen in love with the culture and even stayed on for nearly two more years after passing my GCSEs.\n\nI developed a deep appreciation of the local food. Back in London, I never thought twice about what I was eating. But in Ghana, food was not just sustenance  each dish had its own story.\n\nI became obsessed with waakye  a dish made from rice and black-eyed peas, often cooked with millet leaves, giving it a distinctive purple-brown colour. It was usually served with fried plantain, the spicy black pepper sauce shito, boiled eggs, and sometimes even spaghetti or fried fish. It was the ultimate comfort food.\n\nI enjoyed the music, the warmth of the people and the sense of community. I was not just stuck in Ghana any more  I was thriving.\n\nMy mother, Patience Wilberforce, passed away recently, and with her loss I have reflected deeply on the decision she made all those years ago.\n\nShe saved me. Had she not tricked me into staying in Ghana, the chances of me having a criminal record or even serving time in prison would have been extremely high.\n\nI went on to enrol at the College of North West London aged 20 to study media production and communications, before joining BBC Radio 1Xtra via a mentoring scheme.\n\nThe guys I used to hang out with in north-west London did not get the second chance that I did.\n\nGhana reshaped my mindset, my values and my future. It turned a misguided menace into a responsible man.\n\nWhile such an experience might not work for everyone, it gave me the education, discipline and respect I needed to reintegrate into society when I returned to England.\n\nAnd for that, I am forever indebted to my mother, to my uncles and to the country that saved me.\n\nMark Wilberforce is a freelance journalist based in London and Accra.\n\n",

            "content": "By Reuters\n\nEMPLOYEES at Voice of America were placed on paid leave on Saturday and funding for two U.S. news services that broadcast to authoritarian regimes was slashed, one day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order gutting the government-funded media outlets parent and six other federal agencies.\n\nMultiple workers at Voice of America, an international media broadcaster that operates in more than 40 languages, shared with Reuters an email that placed them on administrative leave with full pay and benefits until otherwise notified.\n\nThe emails, sent by a human resources executive at the U.S. Agency for Global Media, the VOAs parent agency, instructed them not to enter their work premises or access internal systems.\n\nIt was not immediately clear how many employees were placed on leave.\n\nThe U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) also terminated funding for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, which broadcasts to countries in Eastern Europe, including Russia and Ukraine, as well as for Radio Free Asia, which broadcasts to China and North Korea, according to letters seen by Reuters.\n\nOn its website, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty notes that it has been declared an undesirable organization by the Russian government and warns readers in Russia and Russia-occupied Ukraine that they could face fines or imprisonment for sharing, liking, commenting on, or saving our content, or for contacting us.\n\nThe move follows Trump signing an executive order on Friday instructing USAGM and six other little-known agencies to reduce their operations to the bare minimum mandated by the law, saying it was necessary to shrink bureaucracy.\n\nTrump, who clashed with the Voice of America during his first term, picked former news anchor Kari Lake to be its director for his second term. Lake, a staunch ally of the president, has often accused mainstream media of harboring anti-Trump bias.\n\nIn a message on the social media platform X on Saturday, Lake said Trumps order impacted USAGM and its outlets VOA and OCB, referring to the Office of Cuba Broadcasting. She told employees of the agency to check their emails immediately.\n\nFree press advocates critical\n\nThe president of the National Press Club in Washington, Mike Balsamo, released a statement on social media objecting to the moves at Voice of America.\n\nFor decades, Voice of America has delivered fact-based, independent journalism to audiences worldwide, often in places where press freedom does not exist, Balsamo said.\n\nThe decision, he said, undermines Americas commitment to a free and independent press.\n\nThe Paris-based Reporters Without Borders also blasted the move, with its director general, Thibaut Bruttin, saying that it threatens press freedom worldwide and negates 80 years of American history in supporting a free flow of information.\n\nSome Republicans have accused VOA and other publicly-funded media outlets of being biased against conservatives. Last month, billionaire Elon Musk, who is spearheading Trumps government downsizing effort, called for VOA and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty to be shut down in a post to his X social media platform.\n\nIn a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Lake said that while she understood calls to completely dismantle VOA, she believed it could be improved.\n\nIn addition to USAGM, Trumps order also targeted the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, the Institute of Museum and Library Services, the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, the Community Development Financial Institutions Fund, and the Minority Business Development Agency for cuts.\n\nThe order said those agencies should eliminate all operations not codified in statute as well as reduce the performance of their statutory functions and associated personnel to the minimum presence and function required by law.\n\nSo far, Musks Department of Government Efficiency has produced potential cuts of more than 100,000 jobs across the 2.3 million-member federal civilian workforce, the freezing of foreign aid, and the cancellation of thousands of programs and contracts.\n\nOn Friday, several DOGE employees arrived at the United States Institute of Peace, accompanied by two FBI agents, according to Gonzo Gallegos, the institutes communications director. They left after a brief discussion about the institutes status.\n\nThe institute is not part of the federal executive branch, but is instead an independent, non-profit agency that was established by Congress in 1984.\n\n",

However, the US chose not to follow that process.\n\nTheyve gone through another process rather than just declaring our Ambassador PNG [persona non grata]. So thats the route that they have chosen, and we will have to respect the decision as a sovereign state, said Phiri.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking to the SABC on Saturday, Lamola said the expulsion of Rasool was an unprecedented, regrettable decision by the US as it was not done via normal diplomatic relations.\n\nIt is also regrettable because he was at a very advanced stage to prepare for the special envoys, to reset the relations and so forth. But we are now where we are we have to work with what we have, and that is what we will continue to do because we believe the relationship between the two countries is mutually beneficial, it is strategic, and it has to be maintained.\n\nLamola added: We need to find time to engage with each other behind closed doors, where the US can raise their concerns with us, and we can also raise our concerns with them because it is not helpful to engage in megaphone and Twitter diplomacy. But we have to engage each other face-to-face on various issues of mutual concern.\n\nHe said South Africa would continue to engage and open the lines of diplomatic engagements with the US.\n\nLamola said it was unfortunate the Trump administration had taken the route of engaging in tweets, adding that this was not helpful in mending the relationship.\n\n",

            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) has cautioned the Government of Zimbabwe (GoZ) that the arrest of Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) journalist Blessed Mhlanga, alongside other political activists, threatens to drag the nation back to its dark ages, jeopardising its standing in the international community.\n\nZimbabwe at one point was branded a pariah State due to rising cases of rights violations.\n\nIn a statement released Friday, the commission warned that the recent arrests of Mhlanga and several other activists are leaving an indelible stain on Zimbabwes justice system, which is frequently accused of being a mere puppet on a string, manipulated by the ruling Zanu PF party.\n\nThe ZHRC is, however, deeply concerned by the arrests of journalists and human rights defenders, particularly in cases where heightened political interests are at stake.\n\nThe Commission has noted with concern that such political interests often muddy the waters of the justice delivery process and procedures, frequently at the expense of the accuseds rights.\n\nThis also detracts from the positive progress Zimbabwe has generally made in upholding fundamental rights and freedoms, the statement read.\n\nThe Commission further reminded the GoZ of its obligations under the national Constitution, as well as various international and regional instruments to which Zimbabwe is a signatory, regarding freedom of expression, association, and assembly.\n\nThe right to freedom of opinion and expression is guaranteed by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights  on which Zimbabwe recently presented a report to the United Nations Human Rights Council in Geneva  and by the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights.\n\nThe ZHRC further reminds the GoZ of UN resolutions on the treatment of journalists, including the Human Rights Council Resolution HRC/RES/21/12 on the safety of journalists, the statement continued.\n\nThe Commission also asserted that every individual has the right to share and debate even politically sensitive issues without fear of reprisal.\n\nThe ZHRC reminds everyone that it is acceptable to openly share views and debate even sensitive political issues, such as the current debate on the amendment of the Constitution to extend presidential terms to 2030 or beyond.\n\nEvery person in Zimbabwe has a right to express their views without fear of persecution or reprisal on this or any other matter and seek to persuade others in a peaceful manner, the statement declared.\n\nThe Commission did, however, commend the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) for treating Mhlanga with dignity, even though the court heard two weeks ago that he was forced to sleep in a filthy police cell, a fate not fit for a dog, let alone a human being.\n\nMhlanga was arrested on 24 February 2025 after turning himself in to the police, who had publicly sought his whereabouts.\n\nThe charge of inciting public violence stems from HSTVs broadcast of explosive press briefings given by expelled Zanu-PF Central Committee member Blessed Geza, in which Geza called for President Emmerson Mnangagwa to resign.\n\nHe was charged with transmitting messages with intent to incite public violence or damage to property under Section 164 of the Criminal (Codification and Reform) Act.\n\nMhlanga was denied bail by the Harare Magistrate Court, and his bail appeal at the High Court has been shelved indefinitely. He remains in custody at Harare Remand Prison.\n\n",

            "content": "By The New York Times\n\nA DRAFT circulating inside the administration lists three tiers of countries whose citizens may face restrictions on entering the United States.\n\nThe most stringent restriction level would flatly bar citizens from 11 countries from entering the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration is considering targeting the citizens of as many as 43 countries as part of a new ban on travel to the United States that would be broader than the restrictions imposed during President Trumps first term, according to officials familiar with the matter.\n\nA draft list of recommendations developed by diplomatic and security officials suggests a red list of 11 countries whose citizens would be flatly barred from entering the United States. They are Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen, the officials said.\n\nDraft List of Proposed Travel Ban Countries\n\nAn internal Trump administration proposal lists the following countries whose citizens could face restrictions on entering the U.S. Some countries may change in any final order.\n\nRed\n\nAll travel banned\n\nOrange\n\nVisas sharply restricted\n\nYellow\n\n60 days to address concerns\n\nThe officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive internal deliberations, cautioned that the list had been developed by the State Department several weeks ago, and that changes were likely by the time it reached the White House.\n\nOfficials at embassies and in regional bureaus at the State Department, and security specialists at other departments and intelligence agencies, have been reviewing the draft. They are providing comment about whether descriptions of deficiencies in particular countries are accurate or whether there are policy reasons  like not risking disruption to cooperation on some other priority  to reconsider including some.\n\nThe draft proposal also included an orange list of 10 countries for which travel would be restricted but not cut off. In those cases, affluent business travelers might be allowed to enter, but not people traveling on immigrant or tourist visas.\n\nCitizens on that list would also be subjected to mandatory in-person interviews in order to receive a visa. It included Belarus, Eritrea, Haiti, Laos, Myanmar, Pakistan, Russia, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Turkmenistan.\n\nWhen he took office on Jan. 20, Mr. Trump issued an executive order requiring the State Department to identify countries for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries.\n\nHe gave the department 60 days to finish a report for the White House with that list, meaning it is due next week. The State Departments Bureau of Consular Affairs has taken the lead, and the order said the Justice and Homeland Security Departments and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence were to assist with the effort.\n\nSpokespeople at several agencies declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment. But the State Department previously said it was following Mr. Trumps order and was committed to protecting our nation and its citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process, while declining to specifically discuss internal deliberations.\n\nThe Times and other news outlets reported this month that Afghanistan, which was not part of Mr. Trumps first-term travel bans but fell to the Taliban when the U.S. withdrew its forces in 2021, was likely to be part of the second-term ban. But the other countries under consideration had been unclear.\n\nIt is also not clear whether people with existing visas would be exempted from the ban, or if their visas would be canceled. Nor is it clear whether the administration intends to exempt existing green card holders, who are already approved for lawful permanent residency.\n\nThe Trump administration this past week said it had canceled the green card of a Syrian-born former Columbia University graduate student of Palestinian descent, Mahmoud Khalil, because he had led high-profile campus protests against Israels war in Gaza that the government says were antisemitic, setting off a court fight over the legality of that move.\n\nSome of the countries on the draft red and orange lists were sanctioned by Mr. Trump in his first-term travel bans, but many are new. Some share characteristics with the earlier lists  they are generally Muslim-majority or otherwise nonwhite, poor and have governments that are considered weak or corrupt.\n\nBut the reason several others were included was not immediately clear. Bhutan, for example, was proposed for an absolute ban on entry. The small Buddhist and Hindu country is sandwiched between China and India, neither of which were on any of the draft lists.\n\nThe proposal to sharply restrict, if not outright ban, visitors from Russia raises a different issue. While the Russian government has a reputation for corruption, Mr. Trump has been trying to reorient U.S. foreign policy in a more Russia-friendly direction.\n\nA decision to include Venezuela could also disrupt a nascent thaw in relations that has been useful to Mr. Trumps separate efforts to deport undocumented migrants.\n\nThe proposal also includes a draft yellow list of 22 countries that would be given 60 days to clear up perceived deficiencies, with the threat of being moved onto one of the other lists if they did not comply.\n\nSuch issues could include failing to share with the United States information about incoming travelers, purportedly inadequate security practices for issuing passports, or the selling of citizenship to people from banned countries, which could serve as a loophole around the restrictions.\n\nThat list, the officials said, included Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chad, the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Dominica, Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, So Tom and Prncipe, Vanuatu and Zimbabwe.\n\nDuring Mr. Trumps first term, courts blocked the government from enforcing the first two versions of his travel ban, but the Supreme Court eventually permitted a rewritten ban  one that banned citizens from eight nations, six of them predominantly Muslim  to take effect. The list later evolved.\n\nSoon after he became president in January 2021, Joseph R. Biden Jr. issued a proclamation revoking Mr. Trumps travel bans, calling them a stain on our national conscience and inconsistent with our long history of welcoming people of all faiths and no faith at all.\n\nMr. Trumps executive order in January said he would revive the bans in order to protect American citizens from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes.\n\n",
