            "content": "By Linda Mujuru and Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThis story was originally published byGlobal Press Journal.\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  Eliza Mandove was a child when her brother was killed during Zimbabwes war for independence. She was beaten during the same attack and sustained injuries to her hands and legs. Now 46, Mandove has no motor function in her left hand and struggles to walk and carry heavy loads. She suffers from chronic headaches. She cant work in the fields. Her husband once farmed, but years of drought and erratic rainfall have led to diminishing yields.\n\nAid from the United States was crucial. It kept Mandoves family of seven fed.\n\nIn January, that food aid abruptly stopped. On his first day in office, US President Donald Trump signed an executive order that ended nearly all foreign aid. Mandove and her family  and many others  were left with very little.\n\nThe end of US foreign aid was abrupt. In Zimbabwe, the sudden suspension put many at immediate risk ofhunger. In Uganda, health workers told patients to collect their antiretroviral drugs before clinicsshut down. In Bangladesh, tuberculosis specialists were immediatelylaid off, leaving people with that illness without care.\n\nStories like this emerged around the world.\n\nThe sudden pullout has left a crisis behind. The aid had been a lifeline for millions since the United States Agency for International Development, the US foreign aid agency, was formed in 1961. At the same time, it failed to transform the economies and governance of low-income countries. In the worst cases, it enabled corruption.\n\nIn Zimbabwe alone, nearly US$7 billion in US aid poured in between 1980 and 2025. But in the four decades since its independence from colonial rule, the countrys per capita gross domestic product hasfallen by almost10%. It is poorer today than it was then.\n\nForeign aid, in most cases, feeds people and offers them medical aid one day at a time.\n\nInvestment from China, on the other hand, continues to sweep across the continent. Overall, that investment is creating stable jobs and infrastructure that has the potential to upend decades of reliance on that aid. The question now in Zimbabwe, as in other African countries, is whether this new era will be the one that, at last, brings economic transformation.\n\nTurning that corner wont be easy, says Persistence Gwanyanya, a member of the monetary policy committee of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. Reliance on aid led to the countrys leadership being a bit relaxed when it comes to economic responsibility.\n\nDonors were coming in to fill the gap, he says.\n\nNow, he adds, is the time for change.\n\nWe just have to live within our budget, he says. We need to be more accountable.\n\nZimbabwe was one of the last African countries to gain its independence from European colonial occupation. In 1980, following a bitter civil war, a revolutionary movement led by Robert Mugabe succeeded in overthrowing a white minority government that had itself seceded from the British empire in 1965. The country benefited from infrastructure built under the white-controlled government that, for a while, sustained society.\n\nOur parents could take care of us with ease, says Tellmore Mutize, 63, a dressmaker from Harare who reached adulthood just as the country gained independence.\n\nThere were jobs, she says. Groceries were cheap, and schools were free. When she gave birth to her first child in a public hospital in 1980, she paid nothing and received top-quality care. When she had twins five years later, the experience was much the same.\n\nColonialism left many parts of Africa in shambles and with an impossible task: emerge from decades of oppressive foreign control to effectively manage natural resources, maintain infrastructure and meet peoples health care, humanitarian and economic needs.\n\nDuring the Cold War, a decadeslong showdown between the US and Russia, the US wielded soft power and won global influence with USAID. Since 1946, the US has budgeted over US$1.1 trillion in foreign assistance to Africa, for everything from emergency food aid to HIV/AIDS relief, from early childhood education programs to civil society development.\n\nDeep corruption was beginning to take root, and human rights abuses were a real threat. Poverty remained a problem. But for many black Zimbabweans, life was easier than it had been for generations.\n\nAbundant rainfall boosted agriculture, reinforcing Zimbabwes reputation as Africas breadbasket. The economy grew in bursts, and the health care systemdrew medical touristsfrom across Africa.\n\nThen came disaster. The regions worst drought set in in 1992, leading to a widespread food shortage. The price of groceries skyrocketed. The droughts effects rippled through many sectors, including health care, where hospitals struggled to maintain adequate services.\n\nAs crops dried up, so did public spending. The World Bank began to require countries receiving funding to agree to market reforms, often characterized by privatizing state-owned industries, ending food subsidies and enacting user fees at hospitals.\n\nMaize flour and cooking oil began to flow in from donors like the Red Cross and Save the Children.\n\nWhen they came, we were happy because in 1992, there was no food, Mutize says.\n\nEight years later, Mugabe began expropriating thousands of large, white-owned farms dating from the countrys colonialism era.\n\nFarm workers, villagers and veterans of Zimbabwes war for independence invaded those white-owned farms, leading to 40 deaths (34 black Zimbabweans and six white farmers) and countless assaults. Eventually, those large farms were converted into about 170,000 smaller properties. Much of the land was snatched up by powerful political players; other parcels went to ordinary people who reveled in owning land after generations of oppression.\n\nThe chaotic, rushed and violent nature of the land reforms led to a massive withdrawal of international investment. Zimbabwes central bank began recklessly printing cash. Hyperinflation took root. Corruption ballooned. Public services collapsed.\n\nBy the time Mutize was ready to give birth to her last child in 2003, public hospitals had deteriorated. She paid out of pocket to give birth at a private hospital.\n\nTwo-thirds of the population required food aid in 2002 and 2003. US aidquickly grew, from US$42 million in 2002 to US$120 million in 2007 and US$260 million in 2009. Even so, between 1999 and 2008, Zimbabwes GDP dropped by 49%  the most severe economic downturn in a country not at war, according to a2019 report from the African Development Bank.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2024, PEPFAR, a giant US health program aimed at treating and containing the spread of HIV/AIDS, supplied on average 18% of Zimbabwes national health budget. In 2019, amid chaotic inflation and massive cuts to the health budget, donor contributions to the health budget were 4.5 times larger than Zimbabwes contribution to its own health ministrys budget.\n\nTotal US aid to Zimbabwe peaked at US$340 million in 2022. In 2024, the last full year before the US slashed foreign aid, it totaled US$290 million.\n\nNevertheless, over a third of Zimbabweans continue to live in poverty: Around 35% of Zimbabwes close to 17 million people live on just US$2.15 per day.\n\nEconomists in Africa and throughout the world have struggled to understand why so much aid hasnt brought about structural transformation. Though health aid has had some big successes  new HIV infections in Zimbabwe, for example,declined more than tenfoldfrom a high in the early 1990s  the Zimbabwean economy is chronically unstable.\n\nIn February, Elon Musk, the unelected man who was tasked with dramatically downsizing the US government, claimed that USAID was corrupt. But theres scant evidence of widespread corruption in USAID projects in Zimbabwe. In 58 audits of USAID projects in Zimbabwe, commissioned by the USAID Office of Inspector General between 2017 and 2024, three projects were flagged for having unsupported costs totaling US$660,000. In at least two of those examples, the corruption was at the local level, not within USAID.\n\nThe real corruption is in Zimbabwes halls of power. In 2024, the US sanctioned President Emmerson Mnangagwa and 10 other Zimbabwean leaders for corruption and human rights abuses. The announcement from the US Department of Treasury, which implements such sanctions, noted that Mnangagwa, his wife and senior government leaders are engaged in corruption related to gold and diamond smuggling networks, as well as a host of other illicit financial schemes and human rights abuses.\n\nAnd thats just a small sampling of the known corruption.\n\nWe need to deal with some nefarious activities that have been resulting in the leakages of the revenue from the fiscus, says Gwanyanya. We need to be more efficient as a government. We need to be more efficient in terms of operations  but also in terms of dealing with the wastages and leakages.\n\nThat corruption ripples down into daily life. Bribery is rife. New mothers have to bribe nurses to getofficial birth cards for their infants. Ruling political party leadersgive away land to their supporters. The black market is now thebackbone of the local economy.\n\nEverything happening in Zimbabwe now is a part of the economic crisis that began in the 1990s, says Eldred Masunungure, a retired University of Zimbabwe political scientist.\n\nWe are still in that crisis, he says.\n\nFragility, he says, has become the countrys defining feature: fragile politics, fragile economy and a fragile social order. When corruption is so routine, he says, How do you uproot that?\n\nPeople are desperate, and those who can leave, do so. Masunungures children live in Canada.\n\nDecades of brain drainhave left the country with far fewer skilled people than it needs to fill the void left by aid agencies. Some African countries wont be able to fill the gap, and even with the resources, they might struggle to manage services that were previously run by donors, says Ken Opalo, an associate professor at the Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University. That, he says, is my biggest worry.\n\nEconomic transformation is possible  and China could make it happen, Opalo says.\n\nMore than any other donor, China has been willing to partner with countries of programs and projects that have the potential to deliver structural economic transformation, he says.\n\nMore than 70% of US funding focuses on health and saving lives, while more than 70% of Chinas investment goes toward infrastructure projects like electricity, roads and bridges to drive economic growth, says Deborah Brutigam, director of the China-Africa Research Initiative at Johns Hopkins University. Chinas influence in Zimbabwe includes mining claims worth billions of US dollars in the diamond, platinum, coal, chrome and lithium sectors.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2023, China loaned about US$182 billion throughout Africa  ranging from US$3 billion to Zimbabwe to US$46 billion to oil-rich Angola  according to the Boston University Global Development Policy Center. Most of these loans were for either energy or transportation projects  in line with Chinas US$1 trillion Belt and Road Initiative  and have an average interest rate of 3%, higher than World Bank rates but lower than private lender rates of 67%.\n\nChinas approach is often called debt trap diplomacy, meaning that the intent is to overwhelm low-income countries with debt they cant repay. But theres no evidence that these Chinese loans are somehow predatory, Brutigam says. So far, there are no examples of China deliberately entangling another country in debt, then using that debt to extract an unfair or strategic advantage, she adds.\n\nChina has also been keen to make symbolic donations. In 2022, China built Zimbabwe a parliament building at an estimated cost of US$120million. Its one of 15 African parliament buildings that China has either built or refurbished, though its the biggest and most expensive to date.\n\nMore investment from China isnt necessarily a good thing, says Sabiti Makara, a professor in the Department of Governance at Kabale University in Uganda.\n\nSeeing that America is withdrawing its influence, the Chinese might set new terms that may render Africa dependent on them, Makara says.\n\nOn the ground, Chinese investment brings jobs. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said in March at a press conference that China has created more than 1.1 million jobs in Africa over the past three years.\n\nBut Zimbabweans say those jobs arent necessarily good ones.\n\nNathan Chiwundo worked for a Chinese brick molding company in Harare. There were poor labor conditions and frequent regulation violations, he says. There were no days off  he worked weekends and public holidays.\n\nBut jobs are rare, Chiwundo says, so people will continue to fill them if China provides them.\n\nFor regular people, he says, more investment from China will be meaningless if employees are not well taken care of.\n\nZimbabwean leaders say theyve been able to respond to the countrys most urgent needs, despite the lack of aid.\n\nThere are enough antiretroviral drugs for all who need them, Dr. Douglas Mombeshora, minister of health and child care, told journalists at a media workshop in April. Spending has also been reprioritized to care for people who have tuberculosis and provide malaria treatment, and US$12 million has been earmarked to import medication.\n\nThere is no need to panic, he said.\n\nGwanyanya, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe committee member, says hes confident that everything will work out. We just need to adjust to the new reality, he says. Otherwise, we cant survive.\n\nMandove, the woman injured during the war for independence, isnt so sure.\n\nUS aid helped ensure that countless Zimbabweans  and people across the world  had enough to eat. China might invest in roads and factories, but USAID kept food on tables.\n\nNow, Mandove says, her family eats just two meals a day, usually wheat with wild okra. Its cheaper than maize, the countrys staple food. Her youngest son, just 10 years old, herds cattle for neighbors to earn money. But the family doesnt have what it needs.\n\nThe food is not enough, she says. I am usually hungry.\n\nApophia Agiresaasi, GPJ, contributed reporting to this story.\n\nGamuchirai Masiyiwais a Reporter-in-Residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.

            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nUNITED Kingdoms (UK) Minister for Africa, Lord Ray Collins, the first British cabinet member to visit in seven years, has confirmed their softened stance towards Zimbabwe and talked of a new approach towards the continent and former colony.\n\nCollins, who visited President Emmerson Mnangagwa at State House on Wednesday, said Prime Minister Keir Starmers government had crafted a new approach that emphasised on listening rather than talking, on Africas agenda and not only theirs.\n\nHis watered-down comments come barely a month after the UK struck off former Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) boss Isaac Moyo, former police Commissioner General Godwin Matanga, ministers Anselem Sanyatwe, Owen Ncube and the Zimbabwe Defence Industries (ZDI) from its sanctions list.\n\nSanyatwe gained infamy for testifying, during an August 1, 2018, Commission of Inquiry in defence of soldiers, who gunned down innocent lives in Harare. Moyo and Matanga formed part of Mnangagwas brutal security apparatus, specifically targeted at dissenting political and human rights activists.\n\nWe are absolutely committed to building a partnership based on equality and respect but on a simple mission of economic growth, growth that can support both our people (and) creating a win-win situation, said Collins.\n\nI am extremely pleased and looking forward to returning to Zimbabwe.\n\nThe new government in the UK is about developing a new approach to the continent of Africa, where we actually launched a consultation last year, a consultation on our approach, which was about listening and not talking, focusing on the continents agenda and not only ours.\n\nThe dramatic shift in policy comes at a time Mnangagwa had unsuccessfully been battling to re-engage with Western countries such as America, the UK, Australia and Canada, who have always pointed out his human rights record as a red flag.\n\nIn December 2024, Collins spoke against readmitting Zimbabwe into the Commonwealth, a union of mainly former British colonies. Speaking in the UK Parliaments House of Lords, he said his Africa office did not support Zimbabwes readmission after an assessment by the Commonwealth Secretariat. He proposed further steps on democracy, government and respect for human rights.\n\nSpeaking to journalists after meeting Mnangagwa on Wednesday, Collins said their approach was not a one size fits all.\n\nHe added: That win-win situation is something that I think we all want to ensure future prosperity for Zimbabwe and future prosperity for the UK.\n\nAs we move forward, what we are absolutely clear, our approach is not one size fits all, it is about strengthening our bilateral relations. I said to His Excellency that I am very determined to return to Zimbabwe to ensure that we actually deliver what we promise.\n\n",

            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nIn Filabusi, the streets are packed with BMW X5s and Land Rover Defenders, modern houses paid for in cash are springing up and whisky is only sold by the bottle in the small towns bars.\n\nThe three-year surge in gold prices, driven to a record this year as US President Donald Trumps trade war bolstered its allure as a safe-haven, is enriching the countrys more than 700,000 informal, or artisanal, miners. They are flocking to gold mining belts and throwing a lifeline to an economy thats been in economic turmoil since the turn of the century.\n\nIn the first five months of this year, those miners almost doubled the metal they delivered to a state refinery from a year earlier to more than 11 tons, swelling the countrys export income. At the current pace of production the country could earn a billion dollars more from gold shipments this year than in 2024.\n\nThe prices have been very favourable to the miners which is something we are so happy about, said Wellington Takavarasha, the president of Zimbabwe Artisanal and Small Scale for Sustainable Mining Council. This year is looking very good. We must capitalize on this rally.\n\nFor the about 4% of people living in Zimbabwe, and their dependents, who are involved in the gold mining its been a vital source of income. Formal employment has withered and millions of citizens have emigrated to South Africa, the UK and other countries in search of economic opportunities. For now, its their only hope and one that depends on the high prices holding.\n\nSo far, theres no sign that the rally will come to an end. The price of the metal has surged 22% since Trumps inauguration and is up by three-fifths since the beginning of last year. It hit a record of $3,432 an ounce on May 6 and Goldman Sachs forecast it will reach $3,700 by year end.\n\nThats pushed Zimbabwes central bank to paying cash for gold deliveries, targeting a record 40 tonnes of purchases this year after it earned $2.5 billion in 2024, a 37% jump from the year earlier. Artisanal producers supplied three-quarters of the metal delivered in April, whereas a few years ago the majority of their output would have been smuggled out of the country.\n\nBrighton Moyo with a newly acquired BMWbought from gold proceedsat a car wash in Filabusi (Zinyange Auntony)\n\nFor artisanal workers like Mxolisi Dube, clad in navy blue work overalls with a miners torch strapped to his head as he walks through Filabusi, the gold price rally has been a boon. The 33-year-old began mining for gold illegally in 2008.\n\nBut now with higher prices and the cooperation of mine owners, who have begun to invite artisanal workers onto their properties to boost production, his earnings have surged.\n\nYou are assured of getting something at the end of the month, said Dube, who has a copper dental filling and a brass chain around his neck. You are protected. If you are not under a company you always have to run away.\n\nMine owners, struggling with dilapidated equipment and a lack of finance, are increasingly urging those operators to swap the pans they used to sift through river sand for gold flecks for picks and shovels to help them extract as much gold ore to process as quickly as possible.\n\nThis means we always have ore available and are milling more, said Meli Nkulumo, plant manager at Macoomber 7 mine, which lies 12 miles west of Filabusi down winding dirt roads. Artisanal miners were invited onto the property two years ago.\n\nMeli Nkulumo, a metallurgist checks a website displaying gold prices at the Macoomber 7 mine (Zinyange Auntony)\n\nAt the mine, workers use Elon Musks Starlink internet service to compare the prices offered by the central bank to global benchmarks. Goldprice.org is their favored website.\n\nHigher gold prices are better for everyone, said Thulani Ndlovu, the acting mine manager. We can also look forward to a raise in salaries.\n\nStill, its backbreaking work thats carried out around the clock. The miners break up rocks underground with picks, shovel it into a loader which is then winched to the surface. During their eight-hour shifts their only sustenance is maheu, a drink made from fermented corn meal.\n\nBut for artisanal miners the price surge has been life-changing and nowhere is that more evident than in Bekezela, a suburb of Filabusi where property owners are busy putting up brick houses ringed by electric fences and equipped with water storage tanks and solar panels. The town council is having to rezone more land for residential and commercial use and at car washes 4x4s queue to have the dust of the surrounding savannah rinsed off.\n\nBar manager Thabo Mpofu says the gold boom has attracted big spenders and he now sells whisky by the bottle. (Zinyange Auntony)\n\nDrinking holes are busy with all sorts of people spending big, Thabo Mpofu, the manager of Next Generation bar, said, adding that he has seen clients buy bottles of Hennessey Cognac and pour them out on the ground as a show of wealth.\n\nIts also curbed crime including invasions of local mines by illegal operators. Theres nothing bad here that happens, said Melusi Nyoni, the manager of Fred and Fernando mines, which are on the outskirts of Filabusi town, He now allows artisanal miners to work in shafts as deep as a kilometer (0.6 miles). There is gold just all over, he said.\n\nMine manager Melusi Nyoni after visiting the underground tunnels (Zinyange Auntony)\n\nStill, with rudimentary equipment and limited safety protocols, digging up the ore is dangerous work.\n\nGold miners at work in an underground tunnel at the Fred & Fernando mines.Photographer: Zinyange Auntony/Bloomberg\n\nInformal miners accounted for 87% of the 186 deaths in Zimbabwean mining accidents, the Chamber of Mines said in its last annual report. As recently as late May, four died at a mine near Chegutu in northern Zimbabwe when a wall of earth collapsed onto them, according to local media reports.\n\nBut as long as the rally lasts, thats little deterrence for artisanal miners who, until recently, were eking out a livingby camping out and panning for gold in remote wild areas for several months.\n\nThe high prices mean in the near future I will also be seen in a car, says Dube, a father of four. I want a Toyota Hilux 44, with a 2.7-litre engine.\n\n",
