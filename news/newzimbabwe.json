Its a hard pill to swallow.\n\nHorrific killing\n\nSentencing Zivanai to life in prison, Judge William Hart said: You were angry and aggressive, and she was cowed by your behaviour.\n\nYou appear to have become convinced that she was in some form of relationship, perhaps an affair, with another man.\n\nThat was, as far as the evidence indicates, a wholly groundless suspicion and that form of jealousy appears to have been a feature of much of your relationship.\n\nThe circumstances of this poor young womans killing were horrific, he added.\n\n",

Some have been turned into tuck shops by informal traders.\n\nMafume acknowledged before the commission that the council has not been benefitting.\n\nCouncil is not benefiting from that state of affairs. They are not being run properly. The absence an ERP, we need a software to manage the various leases and properties that are owned by the council and there was a deliberate effort from management not to put these properties of Council into a system package, companies like Old Mutual and Real Estates companies use it, said Mafume.\n\nWithout disclosing the exact number, Mafume told the commission that there are properties that have disappeared from the radar of the local authority.\n\nYou cannot transfer it to where there is equal chaos because if you transfer its without the reforms there are more properties that are supposed to be managed by CoH that are disappearing and not being managed well, he said.\n\nCouncil has lost control of some its buildings after being grabbed by barons, who now demand rentals from shop owners.\n\nLast year, the commission revealed that the council collected US$100 in the first quarter of 2024 from tuckshop owners, exposing leakages and deep corruption within the municipality.\n\nMafume acknowledged that a Citizens for Change (CCC) councillor leases a property from Rufaro Marketing.\n\nI am not aware of any councillor beyond the one that was revealed, Hunters. At the present moment, I know of one councillor who was linked to Hunters Bar. It was publicised that Councillor Nyakudya was leasing, said Mafume.\n\n",

He is not in the equation or this discourse.\n\nZiyambis comment comes days after Information Minister Jenfan Muswere said the same in a statement released hours after Mnangagwas spokesperson George Charamba shared similar sentiments.\n\nBoth are regarded as Mnangagwa loyalists.\n\nThe politically broad-based call to extend the Presidential term of office beyond 2028 remains a rightful and unquestionable obligation for Parliament, the Party of Zimbabwes permanent national democratic revolution -ZANU PF and other legitimate political stakeholders to this matter, said Muswere in a statement.\n\nThose loyal to Mnangagwas deputy Constantino Chiwenga are reportedly grouping to ensure the formerdoes not extend his term.\n\nHe needs to amend theConstitution twice so as to entertain hopes of hanging on.\n\nCharamba said Mnangagwa as President will not tamper with views expressed by people as that right was enshrined in Zimbabwes constitution.\n\nHis comments came after local daily newspaper NewsDay carried a story on leaders of the Zimbabwe Heads of Christian Denominations (ZHOCD) urging Mnangagwa to respect the 2013 constitution and step aside in 2028 when his second term ends.\n\nThe designated role of the President of Zimbabwe in such situations is not to tamper with expressions of viewpoints from the citizenry; rather, it is to allow those viewpoints free play for as long as they remain within the remit of our Constitution, said Charamba.\n\nMnangagwas home province, Masvingo, was the first to urge him to hang on before other provinces and leagues jumped onto the bandwagon.\n\nDespite distancing himself at the partys last Peoples Conference, Mnangagwas allies have continued to push for the move.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nKirsty Coventry hopes to challenge the status quo at the International Olympic Committee (IOC) should she be elected as its first female president.\n\nThe 41-year-old former swimmer would also become the youngest person and the first from outside Europe or North America to head the organisation in its 130-year history should she see offsix other candidatesand succeed Thomas Bach in Marchs vote.\n\nThe Zimbabwean, who is Africas most-decorated Olympian, wants to go further in empowering female athletes by putting in place stronger safeguarding procedures and providing more support for mothers.\n\nI want to show people and women across Africa and the world: Dont be afraid of anything, Coventry told BBC Sport Africa.\n\nIf you believe in something and know you can lead an organisation, dont be too scared to put your hand up and do it.\n\nIts time for women in Africa to stand up and lead, to not be afraid of leading, and to not be afraid of leading in a different way.\n\nCoventry won seven medals, including two golds, across the Athens 2004 and Beijing 2008 Games, and has served as her countrys minister of sport, arts and recreation since September 2018.\n\nShe is also currently leading IOC commissions overseeing progress on the Dakar 2026 Youth Olympics and2032 Brisbane Olympics.\n\nCoventry says her bid to become IOC president is motivated by her desire to give back to the Olympic movement which has changed her life for the better.\n\nDescribing herself as being at the crossroads between the older generation and the younger generation, she intends to embrace new technologies such as online streaming and artificial intelligence (AI) in order to remain relevant.\n\nOne of my expectations from our media rights holders is, how are we going to access streaming around the world? she explained.\n\nWe saw, for the first time,NFL games over Christmas Daybeing streamed on Netflix.\n\nWhat does that look like for us? That is going to be very important as we move into the future.\n\nI do believe that if we can open up opportunities in these new areas, we create more fans which should in turn bring new revenue opportunities.\n\nMeanwhile, Coventry believes AI could benefit athletes on her home continent by helping them gain better access to training tools, doctors and nutritionists.\n\nAs the only woman in the IOC presidential race, Coventry is keen to support female athletes, particularly around what she describes as sensitive topics.\n\nThe introduction ofa dedicated room for nursing mumsat the most recent Olympics is one particular step which she wants to build on.\n\nThis is a great program, she said.\n\nWere going to help mothers come to the Games, and were going to cover that extra ticket. For me, those are the kinds of programs that help more athletes than just a select few.\n\nYet instances of gender based violence suffered by female athletes, particularly in East Africa, have highlighted a deeper problem.\n\nWorld Athletics hasalready identified campaigning on that issue as a prioritybut Coventry aims to take that further.\n\nIf we have an Olympian thats doing some incredible work on gender based violence, how do we support that? she explained.\n\nIs there a sponsor [or] philanthropist that, as the IOC, we can reach out to and put in touch with that Olympian to amplify what theyre doing  to take their voice, their message, from one community to an entire country, to an entire continent?\n\nThe complicated issue of rules and criteria on transgender athletes would also be high on Coventrys list of priorities.\n\nThe Paris Games were mired in controversy when Algerias Imane Khelifwon womens welterweight boxing golda year after being disqualified from the World Championships for reportedly failing gender eligibility tests.\n\nCoventry, much like fellow IOC presidential candidate Lord Coe, is keen to protect the female category by relying on scientific studies  but the Zimbabwean said the matter would be open to review in the future.\n\nIts our duty to ensure equal opportunity and fairness within our competitions, she said.\n\nI dont believe we can do that based off of the medical and science research that Ive seen if we add or allow for transgender women to compete in the female category right now.\n\nIt is very clear that transgender women are more able in the female category, and can take away opportunities that should be equal for women.\n\nIf that changes and theres new ways of doing things, then well look at that.\n\nMeanwhile, Coventry intends to work with individual international sporting federations to ensure that criteria on transgender athletes are consistent across the board.\n\nCoventry does not believe in offering prize money at the Games, an incentive which was first seen at Paris 2024 when World Athleticsoffered $50,000 to every gold medallist in track and field.\n\nInstead, she argues that funds would be better spent elsewhere as prize money would only benefit top athletes.\n\nWe have 10,500 athletes at the Summer Olympic Games and nearly 3,000 at a Winter Games. How do we impact them? she said.\n\nHow do we ensure that Olympians, or prospective Olympians and athletes from around the world get better access to sport, to training, to health and mental health [support]?\n\nThose are the programs that I would like to focus on.\n\nThe other six candidates for the IOC presidency are Frances David Lappartient, Japans Morinari Watanabe, Prince Feisal al Hussein of Jordan, Spains Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr, Swedens Johan Eliasch and the UKs Lord Sebastian Coe.\n\n",
