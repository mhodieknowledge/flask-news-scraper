            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nNewZimbabwe.coms Business Reporter, Alois Vinga (AV) recently caught up with the recently appointed Buy Zimbabwe Brand Ambassador, Portia Muzorava (PM) to discuss the plans at hand as far as promoting local products is concerned. She is also a journalist working for MSU Radio Station. Below are the issues which the interview touched on.\n\nA.V: How are you? Can you share your background in brief?P.M: I am popularly known as Mambokadzi weSungura Popo. I am a media personality and social influencer with a deep passion for promoting Zimbabwean culture and identity. Over the years, I have worked to celebrate our local values, products, and creativity, always encouraging Zimbabweans to embrace and take pride in their own. My strong media presence has allowed me to connect with diverse audiences and become a trusted voice in championing issues that matter to communities.A.V: What are your plans as the new Buy Zimbabwe brand ambassador?P.M As the new Buy Zimbabwe brand ambassador, my main plan is to spearhead the promotion and awareness of the Buy Zimbabwe insignia. I will work to ensure it becomes a symbol of excellence, pride, and trust for both consumers and producers.Through campaigns, media engagements, and public outreach, I want to inspire Zimbabweans to support local products, which in turn empowers communities, creates jobs, and strengthens our economy. I will also focus on giving visibility to member companies and showcasing their innovation at platforms such as the Zimbabwe Agricultural Show (ZAS) and YAFEST.A.V: How do you intend to deal with challenges affecting local manufacturers?P.M: Local manufacturers are facing challenges such as stiff competition from imports, limited consumer awareness of local product quality, and issues around market visibility. Some are also hampered by misconceptions that foreign products are superior. My role is to help address these challenges by driving consumer confidence in Zimbabwean goods through brand promotion, storytelling, and campaigns that highlight the quality, cultural value, and impact of buying local. By amplifying the Buy Zimbabwe message, I aim to shift mindsets and encourage more people to buy local.A.V: How are you going to make sure that the Buy Zimbabwe campaign reaches both the local and foreign markets?P.M: Locally, I will leverage my media influence and public platforms to build strong consumer awareness and pride in Zimbabwean products.Regionally and internationally, we will position the Buy Zimbabwe insignia as a mark of trusted quality and sustainability, appealing to diaspora communities and foreign buyers who are increasingly drawn to authentic, proudly African brands. Participating in trade fairs, cultural festivals, and strategic media campaigns will also help us carry the Buy Zimbabwe message beyond our borders.A.V: What are your targets up to year end?P.M: By year end, I aim to achieve three main targets: To significantly increase consumer awareness of the Buy Zimbabwe insignia. To ensure that member products gain stronger visibility and recognition at major platforms like the Agricultural Show and YAFEST. To establish Buy Zimbabwe as not just a campaign, but a household brand symbolizing quality, pride, and trust.A.V: How are you going to assist local manufacturers in reducing the cost of doing business?P. M: While I cannot directly reduce production costs, my role is to ensure that local manufacturers receive the recognition, visibility, and consumer loyalty they deserve. If more consumers consistently choose Zimbabwean products, it will help local companies achieve economies of scale, which can in turn lower costs.At the same time, through advocacy and dialogue, I will continue to amplify the concerns of our manufacturers so that together with policymakers, suppliers, and other stakeholders, we can build an enabling environment that supports sustainable local industries.\n\nA.V: How are you?
