They cannot be reduced to rag tag sub committees of a corrupt kleptocratic ruling party taken over by a greedy illiterate parasitic elite, Biti said.The lecturers are demanding a salary increase to at least US$2,250 from their current US$250 as well as improved working conditions.Meanwhile, Gift Ostallos Siziba, the former Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) Member of Parliament for Pelandaba Tshabala constituency, called for an immediate reinstatement of six suspended students and demanded justice for lecturers facing hardship and unpaid salaries.We stand in solidarity with ZINASU and join the call for justice for students and lecturers who have endured months of hardship, including unpaid salaries.We will not stand idly by as the future of our youth and the integrity of our academic institutions are compromised, Siziba said.\n\nHe described sanctions against the striking tutors and students union leaders as failure from an arrogant and incompetent leader.\n\nA few days back, six students who are members of the Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) were suspended for holding a demonstration in May in support of their striking lecturers, who have been on an ongoing industrial action since April 16.Two weeks earlier, the UZ administration fired four leaders of the ongoing lecturers strike for using the great hall without approval from authorities, a dismissal that they felt was a way to stop the strike.The suspension of student activists and the dismissal of leaders of the Association of University Teachers UZ is another blatant example of the failure and high-handedness of the vacuous, incompetent leadership of the UZ.Prof Mapfumo is an arrogant incompetent Vice Chancellor who mirrors the glaring ignorance and fascism of those he serves.Universities are citadels of the highest forms of cerebral engagement.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA SOCIAL justice activist, Dr Believe Guta, has petitioned Parliament of Zimbabwe to amend the Maintenance Act, insisting there should be mandatory confirmation of paternity before criminal sanctions can be imposed on men presumed to be fathers of children seeking child support.\n\nIn a petition submitted to the Speaker of Parliament, Jacob Mudenda under Section 149 of the Constitution, Guta noted glaring shortcomings in the current Maintenance Act (Chapter 5:09), particularly Section 23.The provision currently allows for the imprisonment of individuals, who default on maintenance payments, even in cases where biological paternity has not been scientifically or legally confirmed.Guta, who is based in Kadoma, posited that the absence of a mandatory paternity test or legal declaration has resulted in numerous Zimbabwean men jailed based on disputed or later disproved parentage.Many have suffered loss of liberty, reputational damage, psychological trauma, and unjust criminal records, Guta submitted.He described the consequences as irreparable harm caused by an outdated and unjust process.Citing Section 49(1)(a) of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to personal liberty, Guta called on Parliament to urgently review and tweek the law to align it with constitutional safeguards.He opined the inclusion of a new clause under Section 23 of the Act, which would require that no legal proceedings be initiated unless paternity is confirmed through voluntary acknowledgement, a court declaration, or a DNA test, especially where paternity is disputed.The petition is expected to be reviewed by Parliaments relevant committees as part of the legislative process.\n\nIn a petition submitted to the

The donor community has played a pivotal role in easing deficits experienced in the countrys health sector over the years.But speaking during a plenary discussion at a UNFPA organized event to officially commemorate the World Population Day, British Embassy Health Adviser, Tessa Mattholie warned that it will not be business as usual anymore.The amount of money coming from external partners into the health sector in just Zimbabwe alone is about half a billion US dollars a year, about 500 million US dollars a year. When you look at the money that was coming from the Americans, from the global funds, from all the partners and the pooled funds in the health sector, she said.Mattholie said its not just the American money thats reducing as underscored that across all of Europe there are reasons why Overseas Development Assistance is shrinking as well, including from the UK.She said this role of international finance in the Zimbabwean health sector is going to decrease and insisted on the importance of increasing domestic financing.So again, looking at our Ministry of Finance colleagues, obviously its really important that Ministry of Finance disbursements can honour their budgetary commitments because the health sector is going to increasingly need to now rely on domestic financing so thats the point on finance, and everybody has a part to play there in holding government to account, she added.\n\nThe calls come on the back of the US bold decision to cut back financial handouts globally a move which has left the developing world in dire straits.

            "content": "By Tapiwa Svondo\n\nRUTENDO Maregere, widely known in the music world as Frya, is a talented Zimbabwean singer based in South Africa making waves globally.\n\nMany people worldwide have heard her voice without even knowing it, she sang the theme song for the popular Netflix show, Blood & Water, a song she created with Mr Kamera, real name Tatenda Kamera, and also a Zimbabwean music producer based in South Africa.\n\nDespite her international success, Frya holds a special dream that highlights her deep connection to her roots. She revealed in an interview with NewZimbabwe.com that she wants to collaborate with famous Zimbabwean gospel group, Vabati VaJehova.\n\nThe one Zimbabwean collaboration left that I would really love would be with Vabati VaJehova. I have been a huge fan since I was a kid in primary school, no one around me ever understood the correlation but their music soothes my soul and their sound scape is so spiritual and pure. I listen to their songs every single day (I kid you not), Frya shares, sounding excited.\n\nOne day I know Im going to have the privilege of working with them and Im probably going to weep when I meet them because Im such a huge fan and l have a lot of love and respect for how they have remained authentic through generations, said Frya.\n\nThis shows that even though shes known for modern Zim dancehall hits with stars like Winky D and Nutty O, her faith and heritage are very important to her.\n\nHer path to stardom began when a casual Instagram video of her singing an Adele cover went viral, catching the eye of a South African TV producer. This led to her first official music credit: the title track for the show Side Dish.\n\nAfter the Kure remix in 2019, Frya made the big decision in 2020 to focus on music full-time, which led to her music being featured in other shows like The River, Lockdown, and Glamorous Girls.\n\nHow did South Africa help Fryas music career but still keeping Zimbabwe at heart?\n\nSouth Africa is a melting pot of a lot of beautiful African sounds, so being exposed to artists from different walks of life who express themselves differently inspired me to do the same.\n\nIn terms of my Zimbabwean roots that goes without saying, its literally in my DNA and through every single project I have incorporated my culture through the producers Ive worked with, the drums and instruments, the Shona lyrics in my music and the collaborations lve done with other Zimbabwean artists, said Frya.The advantages of working across the borders and being able to work in both Zimbabwe and South AfricaThe advantages I think involve casting my net wide, operating across two musical landscapes exposed my music to a wider audience which is good because music has become globalised so its important to adapt. More exposure means a higher probability of more opportunities as well. I dont really look at the disadvantages / challenges.I get to do what I love everyday and live off of it and that in itself is a huge blessing. The South African people and the industry have embraced me and Im truly thankful. There is opportunity all around us especially as creatives and even though everyone is fighting to be heard and recognised l have always chosen to go through life with the perspective of focusing on my focus, the good and pouring my energy into creating art that is authentic to me, explained Frya.Whats next for Frya and her aspirations for her music in the next few years?Global exposure, Im very excited for whats to come, there are a lot of international collaborations coming with artists, creatives and brands. I love my people and I appreciate how theyve rallied for me. The aim is to keep working hard, raising the flag and expressing myself authentically through good music. God will handle the rest.Fryas message for aspiring Zimbabwean artists, especially those who might be considering pursuing their careers from abroadIm still figuring a lot out myself but what I can say is if music is truly your calling then follow your dreams. Music is not an easy industry it requires purity, tenacity and perseverance. Work hard to perfect your craft to the best of your ability and always take the stairs, nothing worth having comes easy and nothing that comes easy lasts and anyone that tells you any different is lying to you, said Frya.\n\nIn terms of my Zimbabwean roots that goes without saying, its literally in my DNA and through every single project I have incorporated my culture through the producers Ive worked with, the drums and instruments, the Shona lyrics in my music and the collaborations lve done with other Zimbabwean artists, said Frya.\n\nThe advantages of working across the borders and being able to work in both Zimbabwe and South Africa\n\nThe advantages I think involve casting my net wide, operating across two musical landscapes exposed my music to a wider audience which is good because music has become globalised so its important to adapt.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nKUWADZANA East legislator Charlton Hwende appears to have once again thrown himself into controversy, this time with comments comparing President Emmerson Mnangagwa favourably to his predecessor, Robert Mugabe.\n\nJust last week, speaking in Bulawayo at Job Sikhalas book launch, Hwende made remarks to the effect that the opposition had deserted Sikhala during his imprisonment. He implied that Sikhalas prolonged detention at Chikurubi Maximum Prison was due to insufficient pressure from the opposition to secure his release.\n\nMore recently, following President Mnangagwas unexpected visit to the National Assembly during a question-and-answer session, Hwende seized upon the Zanu-PF leaders gesture to draw a stark contrast between Mnangagwa and Mugabe.\n\nHwende argued that Mnangagwas three appearances at Parly business made him way better than Mugabe  a view that has ignited a storm on social media. Critics have accused Hwende of having sold out long ago, suggesting that his former CCC party leader, Nelson Chamisa, was right to distance himself from what they described as a poisoned chalice.\n\nMugabe never attended Parliament outside the official opening ceremonies. This is the third time that President ED has come to Parliament outside the official opening ceremonies. Next time we must have the President during questioning time responding to our questions, Hwende wrote on his X account recently.\n\nWhen challenged on X to explain his post, Hwende doubled down, suggesting that Mnangagwa was indeed superior to Mugabe.\n\nComparing him with Mugabe, he is far much better, Hwende posted.\n\nThis comment did not sit well with many on X, who bombarded Hwende with messages, subjecting him to ridicule.\n\nOne X user, Kandawasvika, suggested that Hwendes praise of Mnangagwa was evidence that he worked with self-appointed CCC Secretary General Sengezo Tshabangu to destabilise the party by recalling councillors and MPs, with Chamisa as their primary target.\n\nThis guy was actually the SG expected to organise the opposition against Emmerson. Now Ive no doubt that he worked with chabangu to destroy the opposition, they said.\n\nOthers argued that even in his cruelty and dictatorship, Mugabe did not seize control of the opposition party and hand it over to his proxies.\n\nMugabe didnt take our party and gave it to his proxies, said X user Mboniso Moyo.\n\nAnother X user, Clemy Tinashe, lamented the perceived lack of calibre among opposition figures.\n\nThe calibre of the people we are banking on as the alternative is ridiculously shocking! We are heading nowhere as a country.\n\nSome users also suggested that Chamisa was justified in leaving the CCC, arguing that working with individuals like Hwende was a recipe for failure.\n\nI see most people blaming Chamisa about his decisions to leave CCC but how can you build a political party with sell outs like this one, questioned X user Tapfuma.\n\n",
