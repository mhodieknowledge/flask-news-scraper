I also stated that the Presidents family were involved.\n\nOn Tuesday I requested a meeting with the President and told him that I recognised that I should not have involved his family, and I apologised unreservedly.\n\nHe expressed concern about the substance of my general allegations on the magnitude of corruption and asked that I substantiate this. I agreed to provide him with a dossier of what I understand is going on. On the issue of his children being involved, he asked who was implicated and I identified 3 (three) of his sons.\n\nOn Wednesday I returned to State House to discuss this further with the three men involved and I outlined what I was hearing but could not provide firm evidence to support these allegations and rumors. I again apologised and said I would withdraw my statement on this matter, reads the letter.\n\n",

            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nTHE Centre for Natural Resources Governance (CNRG) is demanding a thorough investigation into the death of another Zimbabwean at the Chinese-run Sino Africa Huijin Mine at Premier Estate in Old Mutare.\n\nAlfred Dzodzo was allegedly shot dead Wednesday night by a security guard who, without warning, fired directly into his face. Dzodzo was accused of attempting to steal gold.\n\nThe mine has operated illegally since 2023, its licence having expired. This unlawful operation has continued with the full knowledge of the government through the Environmental Management Agency (EMA), as confirmed to Parliament two years ago.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, CNRG called for a comprehensive investigation charging that the company has an apparent disregard for human life.\n\nWe also call for a thorough investigation into the killing of Alfred Dzodzo, with those responsible held accountable under the Zimbabwean law, reads part of the statement.\n\nAdditionally, an audit should be carried out on Sino Africa Huijins financial activities, particularly its alleged involvement in gold smuggling and organized crime, their statement reads.\n\nFollowing Dzodzos death, CNRG has urged the Zimbabwean government to shut down the mine, expel the Chinese operatorswho are understood to be working without a valid licenceand grant mining rights to local artisanal miners. They argue these miners deserve to benefit from the natural resources in their communities.\n\nIn light of this, CNRG calls on the government to permanently shut down Sino Africa Huijin and open the site to Zimbabwean artisanal miners under the auspices of Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation and Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe. This will ensure Zimbabwean nationals can benefit from their natural resources whilst also ensure government generate revenues, part of the statement reads.\n\nSino Africa Huijin is no stranger to controversy. In January this year, Taurai Dozva died mysteriously while on night duty at the mine. The Chinese offered his family US$2,000 as compensation  a plaster on a gaping wound.\n\nIn November 2023, CNRG implored Parliament to shut down the mine due to environmental crimes and exploitative labour practices. The company also reportedly smuggles unprocessed gold out of the country, robbing Zimbabwe of crucial revenue, a financial haemorrhage bleeding the nation dry.\n\nReports of killings and abusive labour practices by Chinese nationals at Zimbabwean mining sites are rampant, a grim tapestry woven with threads of exploitation.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Environmental Law Society (ZELA) and other labour rights activists have condemned these killings.\n\nA violent confrontation at Bijou Farm in Gweru on January 21 further illustrates the tension. A worker demanding unpaid wages clashed with supervisors, igniting outrage on social media and strengthening calls for action against exploitative Chinese investors.\n\nThe incident involved Kholwani Dube, an excavator operator employed by Ming Chang Sino-Africa Mining Investments.\n\nBeyond its appalling human rights and safety record, Sino Africa Huijin is accused of siphoning gold from Zimbabwe. Workers allege that much of the gold they mine goes undeclared, disappearing into the pockets of the Chinese owners.\n\nDzodzos killing has reignited the debate surrounding the treatment of Zimbabwean workers by Chinese investors, with critics accusing authorities of turning a blind eye to labour violations, leaving a bitter taste of injustice.\n\n",

To begin with, we have identified roads infrastructure. We need to fix these roads, which were damaged by miners as they ferried their produce to the market.\n\nWe realise that the government alone has no capacity to single handedly repair these roads so concerned stakeholders have to join hands in solving the problem, he said.\n\nMakwiranzou said the programme, which is being rolled out on the basis of mutual engagement and dialogue has seen miners in the area being asked to assist with machinery like front-end loaders and graders to repair the roads.\n\nHe said the 11 mining companies in Mutoko North constituency can assist with trucks to ferry gravel as well as fuel to capacitate villagers and the local authority in realising their objectives.\n\nEnvironmentalists have attributed the ongoing concerted efforts to CSOs like Silveira House for implementing programmes fostering engagement and dialogue, allowing communities to express their concerns to mining companies, political actors, and policymakers.\n\nThis engagement has seen the culmination of community cohesion which is vital for promoting responsible and sustainable mining practices, ultimately, amplifying the voice and agency of mining-impacted communities.\n\nWhile we are aware that CSR is voluntary, we will be using engagement and dialogue to source for these resources.\n\nWe also need assistance with school furniture, ICT consumables in learning. Specifically, it is a pilot programme in Mutoko North, we will roll it out as a national programme, added Makwiranzou.\n\n",

Anything can happen (in a race). Why should we have fear and say Gerda is here shes gonna win. No! I am not gonna do that.\n\nIt was a breath of fresh air really, Tshumas boldness breaking the somewhat monotonous nature of road races where Steyn is involved  the rest of the athletes often being afraid to rate themselves as capable of challenging the Smiling Assassin.\n\nTshuma has shown herself to be a competitive runner in the ultras with last years edition and then going on to get gold (fifth place) in her maiden Comrades Marathon later in the year.\n\nIntent on challenging Steyn as she is, the woman who is married to 2023 Totatlasport Two Oceans Marathon champion and last years third-place finisher Givemore Mudzinganyama is using the 56 km race as preparation for her second World Major Marathon.\n\nMy training has gone very well. I am just here for a long run anyway Gerda, she said, turning to look at the multiple champion and record holder as if to say dont worry you can keep your title.\n\nThe amusement in the room knew no bounds as just about everyone, including Steyn herself burst into laughter.\n\nGerda, I am preparing for the London Marathon. But the Two Oceans Marathon is my favourite marathon so I just said let me come do my last long run. And theres only one month left before Comrades so I just wanted to check their fitness for Comrades.\n\nSuch confidence! Such bravado! It can only augur well for the sport to have someone who dares to challenge the road running queen who is going for a sixth successive victory in the 56km world famous ultra.\n\nSteyn remained her ice cool self though amidst Tshumas goading and described it as a blessing to be back again to do the Two Oceans.\n\nThe distance is where my sweet spot lies and also the Two Oceans in the few years since I started running opened so many doors for me and winning it in 2018 really made me believe I can be a champion.\n\nAnd I dont know if my career would have been the same way if it wasnt for it. And each year Ive managed to come back and push a little step up and push myself to see what I can do.\n\nWhile the way she has registered her five victories in the race always seemed to suggest she finds it easy, Steyn says the Two Oceans is a tough challenge.\n\nThe Two Oceans is not like any other race. It is not the Comrades and it is not a (standard) marathon.\n\nSo, you need to be really specific about how you prepare for this race, making sure that youve got the speed in your legs as well as the strength to conquer the hills. So the uniqueness of the race is really something that draws me to it year after year.\n\nIs she going to break the record yet again?\n\nIts always difficult for me to talk about the record and I dont want to sound like a record on repeat  pun intended  because especially for today the contenders for this race tomorrow is specifically strong.\n\nAnd it is not just those who are sitting here but there will be more at the start tomorrow.\n\nIt is going to be a fast race and it could be very tactical with the competition being so strong, it is very difficult to speak about the record.\n\nIn my personal space I have to have the confidence that I can break the record; that I am able to push myself to the limit and  first of all to win the race and second of all to break the record.\n\nAnd perhaps to win the race tomorrow might require breaking the record. So, I am prepared for every scenario and we will just have to wait and see how it all unfolds.\n\nShe now also knows that there is a Nobuhle Tshuma who is eager to take her on.\n\n",

This marked the beginning of Gumbos downfall as his web of deceit began to unravel.\n\nGumbo reportedly fled the school premises last Friday night as law enforcement agents came to investigate the matter and question him.\n\nThe scandal came to light after one of the pupils required medical attention following an alleged assault by Gumbo. This medical intervention, like Pandoras Box, unleashed a torrent of accusations.\n\nIn a letter addressed to parents and guardians Wednesday, headmaster Albion Masukume confirmed that investigations are underway, involving both the police and the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education.\n\nI write with deep sorrow to inform you that allegations of child abuse by one of our staff members was reported, he said.\n\nCurrently thorough investigations by Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education and the police are underway. The alleged victim was taken to hospital swiftly and was examined by a medical doctor.\n\nA police report was filed with the Victim Friendly Unit at Mberengwa Charge Office the same day. Meanwhile the alleged perpetrator is not at the station and being sought after for interrogation so that he responds to the allegations, reads part of the letter dated April 3, 2025.\n\nWhile Midlands provincial police spokesperson Inspector Emmanuel Mahoko would neither confirm nor deny the incident to NewZimbabwe.com. He was quoted in a State-run newspaper confirming the incident.\n\nHowever, when contacted by this publication, Mahoko denied ever speaking to any journalist concerning the matter.\n\nTafanana Zhou, legislator for Mberengwa North, which encompasses Masase High School, confirmed the assaults but refrained from speculating on the number of victims.\n\nWe need to wait for investigations to complete so that we will be able to establish the number of learners that were involved in this incident. We should not speculate.\n\nObert Masaraure, President of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ), condemned the alleged abuse, urging the school to bolster its safeguarding procedures.\n\nThe molestation of children at a learning institution is extremely worrisome, he said.\n\nSchools should be safe for both teachers and learners. ARTUZ has proposed safe schools regulations and if these had been adopted such incidents would have been avoided.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, engaging in sexual acts with a minor under 18, including sodomy, is illegal under Section 73 (3) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act Chapter 9:23 and carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.\n\n",
