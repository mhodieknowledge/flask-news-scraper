            "content": "By Central News\n\nTHE Department of Transport has pinpointed speeding as a major factor in the horrific bus crash near Makhado in Limpopo that claimed 43 lives on Sunday, 12 October 2025.\n\nA preliminary report by the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) revealed the driver was going too fast for the conditions on the mountain pass, compounded by severe mechanical defects and overloading.\n\nThe bus, travelling from Gqeberha in the Eastern Cape to Zimbabwe, veered off the N1 highway, plunging down a steep embankment and landing upside down.\n\nThe tragedy left 34 people seriously injured and six with minor injuries, with victims including 18 women, 17 men, seven children, and a 10-month-old baby.\n\nMost passengers were Zimbabwean and Malawian nationals heading home, turning a routine journey into a nightmare.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa offered condolences to the affected nations, while Transport Minister Barbara Creecy directed urgent investigations into the bus companys responsibility and possible culpable homicide charges.This incident has reignited concerns over road safety for cross-border buses, with calls for stricter border checks on vehicle roadworthiness.\n\nAs families begin the painful process of identifying loved ones using fingerprints and photos at Tshilidzini Hospital, the focus shifts to preventing such disasters in the future.\n\nInvestigation Reveals Speeding as Primary Cause\n\nThe RTMC probe found the driver lost control while navigating the treacherous Zoutpansberg mountain road, known for its steep descents and hairpin bends.\n\nThe driver of the bus drove at a speed too high for the conditions down the mountain pass, the department stated.The bus tumbled into a ravine, scattering debris and personal belongings across the site.\n\nRescue teams worked through the night to recover bodies and aid survivors, with some passengers self-discharging from hospitals. The crash sites challenging terrain complicated efforts, but authorities confirmed all victims were accounted for by Monday.\n\nJust days later, on 15 October 2025, another tragedy struck nearby when a truck carrying cement plunged off a cliff opposite the bus crash scene, underscoring the roads dangers. No fatalities were reported in the truck incident, but it has prompted questions about the N1s safety for heavy vehicles.\n\nMechanical Failures and Unroadworthy Condition Exposed\n\nA mechanical inspection uncovered alarming defects: only five out of ten brakes on the bus and trailer were working.\n\nDuring the mechanical investigation, it was also established that the bus and trailer only had five out of the 10 brakes in operational condition and that one brake on the bus had no braking ability. It was established that out of five brakes on the bus, one brake was not in an operational condition, the report detailed.\n\nNone of the four brakes on the trailer functioned, and the suspension had been poorly repaired. This left the vehicle with just half its braking power, a defect the driver was likely aware of and had adapted to.\n\nTherefore, the bus and trailer were not in a roadworthy condition by virtue of the defective braking system and the poorly repaired suspension of the trailer. This means that the driver of the bus and trailer was aware of this braking deficiency and had adapted his driving style to accommodate this defect.\n\nBoxes of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs and other medications were found in the wreckage, raising further questions about the buss cargo and possible illegal transport. The bus, operated by DNC Coach Services, was foreign-registered, prompting calls for better border inspections.\n\nOverloading Contributed to the Tragedy\n\nThe bus was severely overloaded, carrying 91 occupants despite a capacity of 62.\n\nThe bus was found to have had 91 occupants, even though the bus only had capacity for 62 occupants, the department said. Among them were 11 children aged three to five, and under regulations, two such children count as one adult. Adjusted for this, the vehicle was overloaded by 23 people.\n\nThe trailer was packed with baggage and belongings, adding to the weight and likely contributing to the loss of control. Overloading is a common issue in cross-border buses, often leading to mechanical strain and higher risks in accidents.\n\nRoad Conditions Ruled Out as Factor\n\nThe investigation cleared the road itself, finding the N1 surface before and after the crash in good condition.\n\nThe road surface along the N1 before and after the crash scene was noted as being in good condition and therefore not considered a cause and/or contributory factor to this road crash, officials confirmed.This shifts blame squarely to the driver and vehicle maintenance, rather than infrastructure shortcomings.\n\nRecommendations for Enhanced Road Safety\n\nThe preliminary report urged focused law enforcement on heavy vehicles, especially foreign ones entering South Africa.\n\nLaw enforcement operations be considered to examine and evaluate the roadworthiness of vehicles that enter South African roads, as the bus is a foreign registered vehicle, it recommended. Such checks could have spotted the defects and prevented the crash.\n\nIt also called for the RTMCs National Traffic Police and provincial teams to target vehicles ignoring warning signs and speeding downhill.\n\nConcentrate their attention on heavy vehicles that do not adhere to warning signs and do not reduce speed when driving downhill, as it is evident that the bus and trailer drove at a speed too fast for the road environment and failed to negotiate the hairpin bend.\n\nThe full technical reconstruction report will take 21 weeks, including a look at weighbridge checks where overloading should have been caught.\n\nMinister Creecys Directives for Accountability\n\nTransport Minister Barbara Creecy has taken swift action, directing the RTMC to probe DNC Coachs role in ensuring roadworthiness and consider culpable homicide charges.\n\nThe Minister of Transport, Barbara has directed the RTMC to investigate the bus companys responsibility in ensuring the roadworthiness of the bus and to further consider a culpable homicide complaint against the bus company in terms of the duties of the operator, the department said.\n\nShe requested the buss maintenance schedule and service records, and tasked the Anti-Corruption Unit to check which testing centre issued its roadworthy certificate. Creecy also ordered inspections of the DNC fleet at borders and any depots in South Africa.\n\nThese steps aim to hold the company accountable and prevent similar tragedies. Families have expressed frustration over DNCs lack of communication, with no passenger list provided, leaving them searching hospitals for loved ones.\n\n",

Our divisions only serve those who benefit from a weakened working class. We must reclaim the spirit of unity that once made labour the heartbeat of this nation. Because when workers speak with one voice, governments listen, employers tremble, and society begins to shift, said Marimo.He said the truth is that workers in Zimbabwe are under siege and reeling under the pressures of eroded wages, broken social protection which has rendered collective bargaining a ritual without any power.The labour leader bemoaned the huge toll of informality on decent work on the back of the rising debt stock, which he said is further worsened by the huge inequality gap.

And if the informal economy is to grow, it must do so with rights, with dignity, and with recognition, he added.\n\nSpeaking at a labour forum co-hosted by the Labour Economics and Development Research Institute of Zimbabwe (LEDRIZ) and the Friedrich Erbert Stiftung (FES), Marimo said the time has come for labour unions to join hands and fight against rising worker poverty.\n\nWe may wear different jackets, but the pain of poverty and exploitation is the same. Our divisions only serve those who benefit from a weakened working class. We must reclaim the spirit of unity that once made labour the heartbeat of this nation. Because when workers speak with one voice, governments listen, employers tremble, and society begins to shift, said Marimo.He said the truth is that workers in Zimbabwe are under siege and reeling under the pressures of eroded wages, broken social protection which has rendered collective bargaining a ritual without any power.The labour leader bemoaned the huge toll of informality on decent work on the back of the rising debt stock, which he said is further worsened by the huge inequality gap.

            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nVICE President Constantino Chiwenga has said Zimbabwes wealth should benefit all Zimbabweans and not just a few privileged individuals.\n\nThe ruling Zanu PF party second-in-charges remarks come days after the leaking of his explosive dossier wherein he demanded the immediate arrest of a number of the countrys super rich businessmen.\n\nChiwenga, who was speaking at the ongoing Zanu PF Annual Peoples Conference in Mutare, urged attendees not to forget why they went to war and that there were colleagues who sacrificed their lives for every Zimbabwean to benefit.\n\nOur theme captured the central task before us, that is to build a people centred economy that empowers every Zimbabwean and ensures that our national wealth benefits all and not just a privileged few. Economic empowerment must be genuine, said Chiwenga as he introduced President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nWe must always remember that we are not the alpha and omega of Zimbabwes journey, ours is to carry forward the torch passed to us by those who gave everything without expectation of reward, he further warned.\n\nChiwenga is in a tight and tense race against businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei to replace Mnangagwa in 2028 although there are concerted efforts to illegally extend the 83-year-old Zanu PF leaders term in office to 2030.\n\nHaving described Tagwirei, shadowy character Wicknell Chivayo and some of their associates as Zvigananda, a colloquial Zimbabwean term that means criminals, Chiwenga reportedly dropped a dossier last month detailing how billions of US dollars were being siphoned by the monied clique.\n\nThat was to be later dismissed in this weeks Politburo where Mnangagwa stood his ground and defended Tagwirei, who has been identified as the preferred successor be it in 2028 or 2030.\n\nChiwenga, who sensationally revealed that late liberation war hero General Josiah Tongogara knew that he would not see an independent Zimbabwe, said the much talked about 2030 Agenda must be understood as their duty for future generations rather than their own.\n\nHe added: Some of them like our late commander General Josiah Magama Tongogara knew they would not see a liberated Zimbabwe. He was told openly when the day comes that this country is going to be free, you will die, but he still fought until the last day.\n\nThey fought for the future, not for themselves, Vision 2030 therefore must be understood in the same light. It is about a Zimbabwe we will bequeath to generations to come.\n\nFactional fights within Zanu PF have now pitted Mnangagwa against Chiwenga in a clear repeat of what transpired between the former and his predecessor Robert Mugabe before the 2017 coup.\n\nQuestions about whether Chiwenga still wields influence within the military, an arm that was instrumental in toppling Mugabe, while Tagwireis financial muscle has proven enough a threat for him.\n\nEven staunch critics such as Christopher Mutsvangwa, who for a time reportedly dreamt of taking over from Mnangagwa, are now strongly behind the Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) elder, Tagwirei.\n\n",
