            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has defended its monetary policy and the new Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency framework in response to criticism from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nThe IMFs August 2025 review of Zimbabwes economic performance praised the RBZs tight monetary policy for stabilising the ZiG and controlling inflation, but called for an overhaul of the countrys foreign exchange (FX) management system.\n\nThe IMF recommended reducing the RBZs involvement in the FX market, specifically lowering the mandatory 30% export surrender requirement and transitioning to a more market-driven approach. It also suggested simplifying the Zimbabwean dollars exchange rate system, which it believes is inconsistent with a floating rate.\n\nHowever, the RBZ disagreed, asserting that its current approach provides essential flexibility for stabilizing the currency and strengthening reserves. The central bank emphasized that its involvement in the FX market is necessary to maintain exchange rate stability and questioned the IMFs recommendation to reduce its role.\n\nOn broader monetary policy, the IMF proposed phasing out Non-Negotiable Certificates of Deposit (NNCDs) and replacing them with tradable securities to improve liquidity management. The RBZ responded by outlining plans to reduce reliance on direct monetary tools and improve policy transmission, including the introduction of a Term Deposit Facility.\n\nAdditionally, the RBZ rejected IMF claims about exchange rate restrictions, stating that recent reforms have removed all formal restrictions and any remaining measures are internal procedures by financial institutions, not government-imposed.\n\nDespite the disagreements, the RBZ expressed openness to future adjustments, such as enhancing the FX market with greater transparency and exploring IMF technical assistance.\n\nThe central bank also reaffirmed its commitment to price stability and long-term reforms, with plans to transition to a mono-currency system by 2030.\n\n",
