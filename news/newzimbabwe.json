The visits follow public outcry over the dysfunctional state of public hospitals.\n\nMnangagwas government has long neglected general hospitals, which now face crumbling infrastructure, medicine shortages, costly patient care and poor wages that have led to low staff morale and a massive brain drain.\n\nOur role as Presidential staffers was to note areas requiring immediate, medium and long-term interventions, and they were just too many, in order to help shape effective health delivery policy.\n\nIt was clear from the visit that the whole health delivery hierarchy needed attention. Failures at basic primary levels like clinics, municipal clinics and district hospitals transmitted themselves all the way to referral hospitals, leading to a system which is creaking from an overload, disrepair and fresh investments.\n\nInterventions have got to be systemic, a lack which in fact explains the rise of top-notch private care-givers who are a ringing antipode to massive failures in the public health system, Charamba wrote on his X account.\n\nZimbabwes referral hospitals are overloaded and overwhelmed, as most primary care clinics are incapacitated and unable to handle even basic health issues.\n\nThe presidential spokesmanalso said Mnangagwa witnessed the Parirenyatwa Hospitals Mbuya NehandaMaternity Wing operating without curtains or heating, compromising patient privacy and comfort.\n\nMany wards do not have enough blankets, and most have broken windows.\n\nCharamba added thatthere are serious administrative inefficiencies across the Ministries of Finance, Local Government, and Health that urgently require a more hands-on approach.\n\n",

Harare City Council is number one, and Bulawayo City Council is number two going forward.\n\nI do not know yet, but we have made the recommendation that we need to have a thorough investigation of all our urban local authorities because there is a lot of decay, said Garwe.\n\nDuring the hearings, which were conducted over a period of nine months, the Jacob Mafume-led council was exposed for its extravagance, with officials taking home hefty perks.\n\nThis is despite the council bemoaning a shortage of funds in its operations, which has seen it failing to provide basics to residents.\n\nA clean-up is expected to be conducted at Town House once President Mnangagwa has reviewed the report and its recommendations.\n\nWith the findings remaining confidential for now, Garwe said his ministry now awaits further instructions from President Mnangagwa.\n\nThey have finished the report. The chairman and myself, as the Minister of Local Government, have come to present the report.\n\nThe details of the report cannot be disclosed today because the President has to go through the report, sit down, finalise it, and give us the way forward, he said.\n\n",

This innovative system utilises advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and big data analytics to enhance traffic flow, road safety, and transparency, said Muswere.\n\nZimbabwe has lagged behind in addressing traffic violations, with offenders often escaping punishment due to an archaic ticketing system.\n\nHowever, given Zimbabwes ongoing power and internet challenges, there is scepticism over the feasibility of the systems success in the country.\n\nMuswere added that the system would be implemented in phases, starting with Harare and Bulawayo.\n\nThe Home-Grown Traffic Management System will be rolled out in phases, commencing with Harare and Bulawayo, followed by other major towns. To support effective implementation, several key enablers will be monitored, including a robust project governance framework, reliable power sources, stable internet connectivity, and strategic system integration with supporting platforms and institutions.\n\nSpecialised courts will assist in expediting justice delivery as the system operates. This localised approach is expected to foster knowledge transfer, skills development, and national pride while promoting self-reliance and sustainability, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nUgandas President Yoweri Museveni has signed into law an amendment that will allow, once again, civilians to be tried in a military court under certain circumstances.\n\nA previous law permitting such trials was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in January.\n\nBefore that ruling,civilians could be taken to a military tribunal if they had been found with military equipmentlike guns or army uniforms. Activists had complained that the law was used to persecute government critics.\n\nParliamentarians passed the amendment last month amid a heavy police presence and a boycott by opposition lawmakers, who argued that it violated the ruling by the countrys highest court.\n\nIn January, the judges said that the military courts were neither impartial nor competent to exercise judicial functions, the International Society for Human Rights reported at the time.\n\nThe amendment appears to try and address some of the issues.\n\nIt says that those presiding over the tribunals should have relevant legal qualifications and training. It also says that while performing their legal functions they should be independent and impartial.\n\nBut civilians can still be transferred if found with military hardware.\n\nThe law will deal decisively with armed violent criminals, deter the formation of militant political groups that seek to subvert democratic processes, and ensure national security is bound on a firm foundational base. If it aint broke, dont fix it!, army spokespersonCol Chris Magezi wrote on X after the bill was passed by MPs.\n\nBut opposition leader Bobi Wine said the law would be used against him and others.\n\nAll of us in the opposition are being targeted by the act, he told the AFP news agency.\n\nThe Uganda Law Society, a professional body that represents the countrys lawyers, has said it will challenge the constitutionality of the amendment.\n\nFor years, activists had argued that the military courts were being used by the government to silence dissidents, with people alleging that evidence had been planted.\n\nIf you are a political opponent then they will find a way of getting you under the military court and then you know your fate is sealed once there, justice will never visit your door, human rights lawyer Gawaya Tegulle told the BBCs Focus on Africa podcast in February.\n\nHe added that people can spend years in detention on remand as the courts await decisions from senior military figures, which may never come, and those who are tried and found guilty face harsher penalties than in civilian courts.\n\nA recent high-profile case followed Novembers arrest of long-time leading opposition figure Kizza Besigye. He was picked up in neighbouring Kenya, taken across the border and then charged in a military court with possession of pistols and attempting to purchase weapons abroad, which he denied.\n\nThose charges were dropped, and replaced with others, when his case was transferred to a civilian court following the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nMuseveni, who has been in power since 1986,described the verdict as the wrong decision, adding that the country is not governed by the judges. It is governed by the people.\n\nHe hadpreviously defended the use of military courtssaying that they dealt with the rampant activities of criminals and terrorists that were using guns to kill people indiscriminately.\n\nHe said that civilian courts were too busy to handle these gun-wielding criminals quickly.\n\n",

As a result, four people died on the spot, while 15 others were seriously injured, Nyathi said in a statement released on Monday.\n\nNyathi confirmed that the bodies of the deceased and the injured had been transported to Karoi District Hospital.\n\nThe bodies of the victims were taken to Karoi District Hospital mortuary for post-mortem examination and the injured were referred to the same hospital for treatment, he stated.\n\nIn a plea for road safety, Nyathi urged motorists to exercise caution and avoid overloading vehicles.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police implores motorists to exercise caution on the roads and avoid overloading vehicles to safeguard human lives, he said.\n\nThe accident has sparked outrage on social media, with many questioning how a Honda Fit, designed to carry a maximum of five people, could have been allowed to transport more than double its capacity.\n\nMuch of the anger has been directed at the police, with accusations of corruption and negligence levelled against law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe police are to blame here. That Honda Fit probably went through at least two or three roadblocks and because the police only focus on taking bribes they let such recklessness go unpunished. Secondly, most of the Honda Fits that pirate these routes belong to very same officers, wrote X user Davison Feliate.\n\nAnother X user, identified as Leeman, shared the same sentiment, condemning the police for their alleged failure to enforce traffic laws.\n\nPolice have no law enforcement officers. How can a Honda Fit carry 12 people? Leeman queried.\n\nThe tragic incident is a reminder of the concerns about road safety and the enforcement of traffic regulations in Zimbabwe, with overloading and unroadworthy vehicles continuing to make the headlines for bad reasons.\n\n",
