            "content": "CNN\n\nTelevangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who became a household name amassing an enormous following and multimillion-dollar ministry only to be undone by his penchant for prostitutes, has died.\n\nSwaggart died decades after his once vast audience dwindled and his name became a punchline on late night television. His death was announced Tuesday on his public Facebook page. A cause wasnt immediately given, though at 90 he had been in poor health.\n\nThe Louisiana native was best known for being a captivating Pentecostal preacher with a massive following before being caught on camera with a prostitute in New Orleans in 1988, one of a string of successful TV preachers brought down in the 1980s and 90s by sex scandals. He continued preaching for decades, but with a reduced audience.\n\nSwaggart encapsulated his downfall in a tearful 1988 sermon, in which he wept and apologized but made no reference to his connection to a prostitute.\n\nI have sinned against you, Swaggart told parishioners nationwide. I beg you to forgive me.\n\nHe announced his resignation from the Assemblies of God later that year, shortly after the church said it was defrocking him for rejecting punishment it had ordered for moral failure. The church had wanted him to undergo a two-year rehabilitation program, including not preaching for a full year.\n\nSwaggart said at the time that he knew dismissal was inevitable but insisted he had no choice but to separate from the church to save his ministry and Bible college.\n\nSwaggart grew up poor, the son of a preacher, in a music-rich family. He excelled at piano and gospel music, playing and singing with talented cousins who took different paths: rock-n-rollerJerry Lee Lewisand country singerMickey Gilley.\n\nIn his hometown of Ferriday, Louisiana, Swaggart said he first heard the call of God at age 8. The voice gave him goose bumps and made his hair tingle, he said.\n\nEverything seemed different after that day in front of the Arcade Theater, he said in a 1985 interview with the Jacksonville Journal-Courier in Illinois. I felt better inside. Almost like taking a bath.\n\nHe preached and worked part time in oil fields until he was 23. He then moved entirely into his ministry: preaching, playing piano and singing gospel songs with the barrelhouse fervor of cousin Lewis at Assemblies of God revivals and camp meetings.\n\nSwaggart started a radio show, a magazine, and then moved into television, with outspoken views.\n\nHe called Roman Catholicism a false religion. It is not the Christian way, and claimed that Jews suffered for thousands of years because of their rejection of Christ.\n\nIf you dont like what I say, talk to my boss, he once shouted as he strode in front of his congregation at his Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, where his sermons moved listeners to speak in tongues and stand up as if possessed by the Holy Spirit.\n\nSwaggarts messages stirred thousands of congregants and millions of TV viewers, making him a household name by the late 1980s. Contributors built Jimmy Swaggart Ministries into a business that made an estimated $142 million in 1986.\n\nHis Baton Rouge complex still includes a worship center and broadcasting and recording facilities.\n\nSwaggarts downfall came in the late 1980s as other prominent preachers faced similar scandals. Swaggart said publicly that his earnings were hurt in 1987 by the sex scandal surroundingrival televangelist Jim Bakkerand a former church secretary at Bakkers PTL ministry organization.\n\nJimmy Swaggart Ministry/WBRZ-TV/Bettmann/Getty Images\n\nThe following year, Swaggart was photographed at a hotel with Debra Murphree, an admitted prostitute who told reporters that the two did not have sex but that the preacher had paid her to pose nude.\n\nShe later repeated the claim  and posed nude  for Penthouse magazine.\n\nThe surveillance photos that crippled Swaggarts career apparently stemmed from his rivalry with preacher Marvin Gorman, whom Swaggart had accused of sexual misdeeds. Gorman hired the photographer who captured Swaggart and Murphree on film. Swaggart later paid Gorman $1.8 million to settle a lawsuit over the sexual allegations against Gorman.\n\nMore trouble came in 1991, when police in California detained Swaggart with another prostitute. The evangelist was charged with driving on the wrong side of the road and driving an unregistered Jaguar. His companion, Rosemary Garcia, said Swaggart became nervous when he saw the police car and weaved when he tried to stuff pornographic magazines under a car seat.\n\nSwaggart was later mocked by the late TV comic Phil Hartman, who impersonated him on NBCs Saturday Night Live.\n\nThe evangelist largely stayed out of the news in later years but remained in the pulpit at Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, often joined by his son, Donnie, a fellow preacher. His radio station broadcast church services and gospel music to 21 states, and Swaggarts ministry boasted a worldwide audience on the internet.\n\nTheres been no greater example of a good and faithful servant than my father. No ifs, ands and buts about it. A man who lived his life for the cause of Christ, Donnie Swaggart said in avideo message sharedon social media Sunday about his dads final days.\n\nThe preacher caused another brief stir in 2004 with remarks about being looked at amorously by a gay man.\n\nAnd Im going to be blunt and plain: If one ever looks at me like that, Im going to kill him and tell God he died, Jimmy Swaggart said, to laughter from the congregation. He later apologized.\n\nSwaggart made few public appearances outside his church, save for singing Amazing Grace at the 2005 funeral of Louisiana Secretary of State Fox McKeithen, a prominent name in state politics for decades.\n\nIn 2022, he shared memories at thememorial servicefor Lewis, his cousin and rock n roll pioneer. The pair had released The Boys From Ferriday, a gospel album, earlier that year.\n\n",

            "content": "As the rise of neobanks and digital-first services reshapes the financial landscape, traditional institutions are under pressure to modernize. But while face-to-face identity checks are straightforward, doing the same online is far more complex. How can businesses verify identities remotely, securely, and efficiently?\n\nThe answer lies in eKYCshort for electronic Know Your Customer. This digital approach to verifying customer identity is now a cornerstone of modern financial services, enabling fast, secure, and scalable customer onboarding.\n\neKYCis the digital counterpart of traditional KYC procedures. It allows companies to verify identities without requiring physical presence or paper-based documentation. By using biometric data, document scanning, and real-time analytics, eKYC systems authenticate users remotely, ensuring compliance and security while streamlining the user experience.\n\nWhile both eKYC and traditional KYC aim to prevent financial crime such as money laundering and terrorism financing, the key difference lies in how they operate. Traditional KYC relies on physical documents and in-person checks, whereaseKYC solutionsare fully automated, using facial recognition, liveness detection, and AI to validate identities.\n\nAdopted globally, eKYC technology has become especially prominent since 2022. Regulatory bodies, such as the Qatar Central Bank, have already established frameworks for eKYC verification, including allowing non-residents to onboard digitally with official approval.\n\nThe debate of eKYC vs KYC is really about automation and scale. Heres how they differ:\n\nAspect\n\nTraditional KYC\n\neKYC\n\nDocument Submission\n\nIn-person, physical documents\n\nOnline upload, real-time capture\n\nVerification Method\n\nManual inspection\n\nAutomated checks with AI and biometrics\n\nSpeed\n\nDays\n\nSeconds\n\nAccessibility\n\nLimited to branch hours\n\n24/7 global access\n\nCost\n\nHigh operational costs\n\nLower due to automation\n\nUltimately, eKYC solutions provide a faster, more efficient route to customer identity verificationespecially for remote and mobile-first environments.\n\nLets break down how a typical eKYC verification workflow works:\n\nIn a well-optimized flow, all these steps occur in secondsthanks to automated eKYC verification and seamless eKYC processes.\n\nAdopting eKYC technology offers organizations numerous advantages:\n\nThere are multiple eKYC types, depending on the channel and depth of verification:\n\nEach type offers a different balance of user convenience, speed, and regulatory compliance.\n\neKYC verification is being rapidly adopted across various sectors:\n\nExample: N26, a German neobank, uses automated eKYC solutions to autofill user data after scanning a document, expediting form completion.\n\nExample: Binance restricts unverified users to withdrawals only. Kraken mandates full eKYC verification to trade.\n\nAcross these industries, eKYC technology ensures security, compliance, and a frictionless customer experience.\n\nAs AI-generated photos and videos become more convincing, electronic Know Your Customer systems face rising fraud risks. A Regula study found over half of firms in Crypto and FinTech had encountered AI-driven spoofing.\n\nRegulations vary by region. For example, the Qatar Central Bank now mandates active liveness detectione.g., head movementson mobile apps and kiosks.\n\nRobust eKYC systems require high-performance servers, secure APIs, and advanced IDV tools. Companies must balance security with usability.\n\nFraudsters may exploit customer eKYC by mimicking reverification requests. Customers who recently completed verification are more likely to fall for scams.\n\nSolution: Launch fraud awareness hubs like Danske Banks support portal to educate users.\n\nThe shift toward digital banking and identity services makes eKYC more important than ever. With eKYC verification now a regulatory expectation in many countries, businesses that adopt this approach early will gain a competitive edge.\n\nWhether youre launching a neobank, enhancing a FinTech app, or optimizing compliance in crypto, investing in eKYC technology ensures secure and seamless customer onboarding. And as digital identity wallets and verifiable credentials evolve under initiatives like the EUs eIDAS update, eKYC solutions will only grow more robust and reusable.\n\nNow is the time to modernize your identity verification strategy. With partners like Regula, you can deploy advanced document verification, facial recognition, and liveness detection toolsready to support your transformation into the future of secure digital finance.\n\n",

            "content": "Zimbabwe Cricket\n\nWellington Masakadza claimed a career-best four-wicket haul, but Zimbabwe were left clinging to hope after South Africa set a towering fourth-innings target of 537 on day three of the first Test at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo on Monday.\n\nWiaan Mulders commanding 147 formed the backbone of the visitors second-innings 369, building on their overnight score of 49 for one and a lead of 216.\n\nThe imposing total left Zimbabwe with the daunting task of pulling off the greatest chase in Test history.\n\nWith Blessing Muzarabani unavailable in the morning due to illness, the hosts turned to Tanaka Chivanga and Masakadza to spearhead the attack.\n\nThe day began promisingly for them when Tony de Zorzi, on 22 overnight, edged Chivanga to second slip, where Sean Williams held a sharp, low catch.\n\nMulder, calm and clinical, raced to his fifty with a string of crisp boundaries.\n\nHe then combined with David Bedingham for a brisk 72-run stand that extended South Africas lead beyond 300.\n\nMasakadza broke the partnership, tempting Bedingham, on 35, into a mistimed pull that found Williams at midwicket.\n\nSoon after, debutant Lhuan-dre Pretorius  fortunate to survive several chances in his first-innings hundred  was bowled for four by Vincent Masekesa, ripping one through the gate to clip the top of middle stump.\n\nMasekesa struck again moments later, removing Dewald Brevis for three as the big-hitters wild attempt to clear long-on missed entirely, and the leg-spinner knocked over his stumps to leave South Africa teetering at 155 for five.\n\nBut Mulder stood firm amid the wobble.\n\nHe brought up a well-earned hundred off 149 deliveries with a crisp back-foot drive.\n\nAt lunch, the visitors were 185 for five, leading by 352, with Mulder on 104 and Kyle Verreynne on five.\n\nAfter the break, the pair added 74 before Mulders enterprising stay came to an end.\n\nHe attempted to go aerial against Wessly Madhevere but picked out deep midwicket, where Takudzwanashe Kaitano took a fine catch.\n\nMulders 206-ball innings featured 17 boundaries and two sixes.\n\nMasakadza soon added Verreynne to his tally, drawing an edge off a sharply turning delivery that Ervine pouched at slip, reducing South Africa to 259 for seven.\n\nMaharaj and Corbin Bosch then piled on more frustration for Zimbabwe with a gritty 92-run partnership for the eighth wicket, pushing the lead beyond the 500-run mark.\n\nMuzarabani, now back in action, thought he had Bosch caught behind  only for a no-ball call to spoil the celebration.\n\nBut Bosch didnt last much longer as Masakadza bowled him for 36 after a missed slog-sweep.\n\nMasakadza then removed Maharaj, who danced down the track only to be deceived in flight and turn  the ball crashing into middle stump as South Africa fell to 352 for nine.\n\nMuzarabani wrapped up the innings by bowling Kwena Maphaka for eight, with Codi Yusuf unbeaten on the same score.\n\nMasakadza finished with four for 98, his career-best innings figures in Test cricket, while Masekesa and Chivanga chipped in with two wickets apiece.\n\nSet a colossal 537 for victory, Zimbabwe began cautiously in the final hour.\n\nOpeners Kaitano and Prince Masvaure looked solid  until the very last ball of the day.\n\nJust as the hosts seemed set to survive the session unscathed, Kaitano edged Bosch to second slip, ending a steady 32-run stand.\n\nThey closed on 32 for one, still needing 505 runs with nine wickets in hand.\n\nZimbabwe have passed 500 in an innings six times in Test cricket, most recently in December against Afghanistan at the same venue.\n\nBut their highest fourth-innings total is 331  made in a losing cause against New Zealand in 2001, also in Bulawayo.\n\nTheir most successful chase remains 174, achieved earlier this year against Bangladesh in Sylhet.\n\nThe next best, 162, came back in 1998 against Pakistan.\n\nThe world record fourth-innings chase is 418  set by the West Indies against Australia in 2003.\n\nWith history stacked high against them, Zimbabwe will need to bat with extraordinary discipline, determination and belief to salvage anything from this match.\n\n",
