            "content": "AFP\n\nKirsty Coventrybecamethe president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), the most powerful person in sport, on Monday in a handover ceremony with her predecessor Thomas Bach.\n\nThe Zimbabwean is the first woman and African to head the body, and at 41, the youngest since Baron Pierre de Coubertin, who is credited with founding the modern-day Olympics.\n\nCoventry accepted the Olympic key from Bach, who like her, is an Olympic champion, winning a team fencing gold in 1976, and earning two swimming golds in 2004 and 2008.\n\nStepping down after a turbulent 12-yeartenure, Bach expressed his confidence that the Olympic movement was in the best of hands and Coventry would bring conviction, integrity and a dynamic perspective to the role.\n\nCoventry, who swept to a crushing first-round victory in the election in Greece in March, leans heavily on her family.\n\nAside from her parents, who were present at the ceremony in Lausanne, there is her husband Tyrone Seward, who was effectively her campaign manager, and two daughters, six-year-old Ella, who Bach addresses as princess, and Lily, just seven months old.\n\nElla saw this spider web in the garden and I pointed out how it is made, and how strong and resilient it is to bad weather and little critters, said Coventry.\n\nBut if one little bit breaks, it becomes weaker. That spider web is our movement, it is complex, beautiful and strong, but it only works if we remain together and united.\n\nCoventry said she could not believe how her life had evolved since she first dreamt of Olympic glory in 1992.\n\nHow lucky are we creating a platform for generations to come to reach their dreams, she said to a packed audience in a marquee in the Olympic House garden, which comprised IOC members, including those she defeated, and dignitaries.\n\nIt is amazing and incredible, indeed I cannot believe that from my dream in 1992 of going to the Olympic Games and winning a medal, I would be standing here with you to make dreams for more young children round the world.\n\nCoventry, who served in the Zimbabwean government as sports and arts minister from 2019 to this year, said the Olympic movement was much more than a multi-sport event platform.\n\nWe (IOC members) are guardians of this movement, which is also about inspiring and changing lives and bringing hope, she said.\n\nThese things are not to be taken lightly, and I will be working with each and every one of you to continue to change lives and be a beacon of hope in a divided world.\n\nI am really honoured to walk this journey with you.\n\nBach, who during his tenure had to grapple withRussian dopingand their invasions of the Crimea andUkraineas well as theCovid pandemic, said he was standing down filled with gratitude, joy and confidence in his successor.\n\nWith her election, it sends out a powerful message that the IOC continues to evolve, said the 71-year-old German, who was named honorary lifetime president in Greece in March.\n\nIt has its first female and African to hold this position, and the youngest president since Pierre de Coubertin. She represents the truly global and youthful spirit of our community.\n\nBach, who choked back tears at one point during his valedictory speech, was praised to the rafters by Coventry, who was widely seen as his preferred candidate of the seven vying for his post.\n\nAfter a warm embrace, she credited him with teaching her to listen to people and to respect them, and praised him for leading the movement with pure passion and purpose.\n\nYou have kept us united through the most turbulent times.\n\nYou left us with many legacies and hope, thank you from the bottom of my heart for leading us with passion and never wavering from our values.\n\n",

This vision will continue to gain momentum in 2025. Our approach involves divesting of non-core assets and concentrating resources on high-performing properties in prime locations, he said.\n\nBy streamlining operations and enhancing service standards, Laurie said the company aims to deliver consistent experiences that align with evolving guest expectations prompted by the strategy to allow for greater investment in innovative technologies and sustainability initiatives.\n\nIn keeping with this thrust, the Group has sold the Great Zimbabwe Hotel and earmarked Monomotapa Hotel and Caribbea Bay Resort for sale. These disposals will allow for the prioritisation of the refurbishment of the remaining properties within the portfolio, as well as allocating funds for the development of phase 2 of the Marlborough Sunset Views residential stands, said Ward.\n\nThe Hotels top three performers for the 2024 financial year were Elephant Hills Resort and Conference Centre, Holiday Inn Harare and Holiday Inn Bulawayo. These contributed 54% to the Groups total revenue for the year.\n\nThe hospitality portfolio achieved a combined annual occupancy of 59% for the period under review, a 7% improvement from the 55% achieved in 2023. This equated to almost 15,854 additional room nights sold during 2024.\n\nThe three branded InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) hotels, namely, Holiday Inn Harare, Holiday Inn Bulawayo, and Holiday Inn Mutare, continue to meet all the requirements of the IHG brand standards, having all passed compliance audits in 2024. Additionally, the lease of both the Holiday Inn Harare and Holiday Inn Bulawayo properties were extended for a further 20-year period, added Ward.\n\n",

            "content": "By Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ\n\nThis story was originally published byGlobal Press Journal.\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  A few days after giving birth to her youngest daughter in May 2024, Shirley Celebrate Mkono, a 34-year-old mother of four, went to her local clinic to seek help for persistent headaches. Nursing staff worried she could have uncontrolled hypertension, recalls Mkono as she cradles her daughter, now 1 year old.\n\nThe attending nurse informed me that my blood pressure was extremely high and I could collapse at any point, she says.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Mkono agreed to call a private ambulance for US$30. Even so, she waited four distressing hours for help to come.\n\nIf the clinic had an ambulance in sight, it could not have taken this long, she says. I could have died.\n\nOnly four public ambulances serve Harares over 2.4 million people, far short of the 32 ambulances the city says it needs; it would take a fleet of 48 to bring Harare in line with international guidelines of one ambulance for every 50,000 people.\n\nIn February, the city council introduced a monthly emergency services levy of US$1 per household to fund additional ambulances for council clinics, collected as part of the monthly electric bill. However, the councils poor track record in managing public funds has made residents and watchdog groups skeptical that the money raised will be deployed with transparency and accountability.\n\nThe local authority has been grappling with health care financing for a long time, says Reuben Akili, director of Combined Harare Residents Association. Akili says the emergency levy will only be effective if it is collected and spent locally to stop funds from being diverted.\n\nThere must be a mechanism in place that ensures the money is ring-fenced to buy ambulances in places where that money was collected, he says.\n\nMkono, who lives in the suburb of Glen View, is doubtful the levy will serve its purpose.\n\nThere is a lot of corruption at the local authority. We pay for refuse collection about $8 per month, but they dont carry the refuse. I remember I last saw a refuse truck in my area in October last year after the mayor visited our area, she says.\n\nEmbezzlement is a persistent problem in local councils, as highlighted in a 2024 analysis of local authorities conducted by the Southern African Parliamentary Support Trust and a coalition of local nongovernmental organizations. Diversion of funds from critical services like health care and sanitation has contributed to a cycle of mistrust and disillusionment, where citizens are reluctant to pay toward public expenditures that dont actually improve local services.\n\nAkili says the scarcity of public ambulance services has led people who can afford it to use private taxis, which can cost US$10 to US$20.\n\nIn May 2024, President Emmerson Mnangagwa set up an inquiry into the opposition-led Harare City Council following reports of corruption and financial mismanagement. The inquiry revealed that the city council has misspent more than US$1 million, with executives spending over US$125,000 per year on holidays even as the city fails to provide adequate services.\n\nMkono questions why the local authority is adding another levy on residents who already pay user fees when they seek medical care in council clinics.\n\nThey should buy ambulances with that money, she says.\n\nIn a written update to residents on recently introduced levies, which also include a US$1 streetlight levy and US$1 water levy, Precious Shumba, director of Harare Residents Trust, says the new fees were never presented and discussed during the annual budget consultations the city council held across Harare in September 2024. Without an accurate, transparent and functional billing system in place, Shumba writes, the levies add to a long list of revenue streams that have the potential to be abused by the cartels running the affairs of the City of Harare.\n\nCaroline Machivenyika accompanied her 17-year-old pregnant daughter to the local clinic in December last year. When they got there, her daughter was referred to a hospital because she was underage, but Machivenyika learned shed need US$70 to get a private ambulance to take them; the city ambulances were unavailable.\n\nI only had US$50 on me; I explained my situation, and after an hour, a private ambulance arrived, she recalls.\n\nTransfers of expectant mothers and traffic collisions constitute the bulk of emergency incidents that require ambulance services in the city.\n\nLike many other residents, Machivenyika has doubts about whether any funds raised through the levy will genuinely buy ambulances.\n\nWe have lost trust in the local authority because the necessities that we are paying for are not being adequately provided. For instance, we only get water three times a week, but we pay for these services each month, says the mother of four.\n\nCaroline Machivenyika, right, with her mother, Esther Machivenyika, at their home in Glen Norah. Caroline Machivenyika had to wait an hour and pay US$50 for a private ambulance because there wasnt a public one available. Like many residents, she questions whether Harares new monthly emergency levy will lead to real improvements in ambulance service. Photo credit: Gamuchirayi Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nBut she says residents unpaid bills are also an important reason the local authority struggles to provide adequate services.\n\nThey are supposed to close access to water for houses with unpaid bills, but when council workers come, people pay $5 bribes and they leave. Others are not even moved because they do not have access to water daily and do not care even if their water meters are disconnected by the council, she says.\n\nStanley Gama, head of corporate communications for Harare City Council, did not respond to several requests for comment.\n\nOnly one-third of African countries have emergency medical services, and most of them require patients to pay a fee.\n\nUpon reaching the hospital, Mkono was cared for and sent home within 30 minutes. She got a prescription for a months worth of medication to take at home, and her condition quickly resolved.\n\nAmbulances used to arrive promptly when there was a need, recalls Machivenyikas mother, Esther Machivenyika, 75.\n\nI remember in 1995 when my husband got sick at home, we called in an ambulance and it did not take an hour to come through and he was immediately taken to the hospital, she says as she shells peanuts.\n\nIn the 1980s, Zimbabwe had a strong ambulance system with well-trained personnel, including a public service in Harare. But decades of economic instability have left emergency services unable to maintain or procure modern equipment.\n\nNow, Esther Machivenyika says a patient has to pay cash up front to get assistance.\n\nYou can die while negotiating payment, she says.\n\nEven if people pay the emergency levy, she has no hope of a change in the situation because of what she sees as a culture of greed in public service.\n\nThey are now seeing money as more important than a persons health, she says. Even at health facilities, you have to pay a bribe to get good service from nurses.\n\nGamuchirai Masiyiwais a Reporter-in-Residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.

            "content": "BySikhululekile MashingaidzeandStephen Buchanan-Clarke,Mail & Guardian\n\nAfrica, which holdssignificant estimated sharesof the worlds total reserves of bauxite (24%), cobalt (49.4%), copper (7%), graphite (21%), lithium (6%), manganese (43%), nickel (4.2%) and rare earth minerals (2%), is at the centre of a global race for critical minerals required in the clean energy transition.\n\nExploitation of these resources should help to boost trade, industrialisation and development, but Africas track record is littered with examples to the contrary. Resource booms become drivers of corruption, conflict and ecological destruction and weaken governance institutions.\n\nGiven the continents economic problems, rapidly expanding population and mounting environmental pressures, there is a closing window of opportunity to ensure this new wave of mineral extraction breaks from historical patterns to become a catalyst for inclusive economic growth and long-term sustainability.\n\nZimbabwes lithium sector exemplifies both the opportunities and dangers inherent in the global race for critical minerals  a subject explored at a May 2025 conference hosted by the Centre for Natural Resource Governance (CNRG) titledEnsuring Equitable Distribution of Costs and Benefits in Critical Minerals Development.\n\nLithium, used in consumer electronics (including batteries), electric vehicles and renewable energy systems, has become an essential mineral to many of the modern industries driving economic prosperity and the global transition to clean energy. As drone warfare continues to revolutionise modern warfare, access to lithium-ion and lithium-polymer batteries has also become an importantnational defenceissue from Washington to Beijing.\n\nZimbabwe is endowed with substantial lithium reserves. Since 2021, the sector has attracted more than $1.2billion in foreign direct investment, withexportssurging 800%, from $7 million in 2021 to $600million by 2024. Investment in the sector has beendominatedby Chinese companies including Rwizi Rukuru, Shengxiang Investments, Sinomine Resource Group, Chengxin Lithium, Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt and Yahua Group. This investment in the sector has beenhighlightedby Mines and Mining Development Minister Winston Chitando as crucial to the governments wider national developmentstrategy.\n\nBut, asshownin previous research by Good Governance Africa and the CNRG, Zimbabwes mining sector often fails to translate into broad-based economic prosperity. Several mining operations have also been associated with incidents of human rights abuses, corruption and environmental degradation, with local residents disproportionately suffering the adverse consequences.\n\nThe surging demand for Zimbabwes critical minerals presents a defining choice for both government and mining investors: they can either leverage this opportunity to empower local people and foster inclusive development or fall back into familiar patterns of exploitation. During conference proceedings, several measures were highlighted as necessary to maximise Zimbabwes chances of seeing the former option.\n\nFirst, Zimbabwes mining sector requires comprehensive legal and governance reforms to unlock its potential for inclusive development. The current system, which vests mineral rights in the president and is administered through the mines and mining development ministry, creates opacity and excludes key stakeholders from decision-making processes. Transferring these rights to an independent regulatory body subject to parliamentary oversight and accountability would enhance transparency and ensure broader participation in mining agreements.\n\nSimultaneously, fast-tracking the implementation of a comprehensive miningcadastre systemis essential for providing real-time, accurate records of mining claims and licenses. This technological infrastructure would serve as a foundation for reducing corruption, limiting discretionary decision-making and aligning Zimbabwes mining sector with international standards.\n\nSecond, prioritising beneficiation to stimulate industrial development and local job creation is essential. In this respect, Zimbabwe passed theBase Minerals Export Control(2022), which includes a ban on raw lithium exports by 2026 to encourage investment in local processing facilities.\n\nOn 10 June 2025, the minister also announceda banon the export of lithium concentrates by January 2027. Although these measures were designed to maximise benefit through localised processing of lithium, aCNRG press statementin response to the ministers pronouncement noted with concern that this urgent reform is being delayed into irrelevance.\n\nThis, as CNRG further highlighted, should be with immediate effect to prevent further natural capital depletion from unchecked lithium exploitation, which has devastating socio-economic and environmental implications. Zimbabwes lithium wealth risks being squandered, as unchecked exports, weak regulation and opaque deals undermine its potential for industrial transformation. Local minerals beneficiation does not always make economic sense. But, where the opportunity for value addition is clear, it must be taken and supported through coherent industrialisation policies.\n\nFurther to this, China monopolising the sector could undermine these efforts, with Chinese companiesalreadyleveraging their position tounderminelocal beneficiation initiatives. Diversifying investment in the sector by addressing governance issues (currently deterring many Western investors) and leveraging opportunities such as the European Unions Critical Raw Materials Act and the US Minerals Security Partnership (aimed at securing critical mineral supply chains) would help to strengthen Zimbabwes negotiating position.\n\nA good step in this direction was the firstEuropean Union-Zimbabwe Business Forumheld from 20 to 22 May, focused on renewable energy and mining investments, among other aspects.\n\nBeyond diversifying investment partnerships, realising the intentions of the Base Minerals Export Control will also require concerted investment in the infrastructure required for local beneficiation projects to operate effectively, a consistent regulatory environment, and decisive action against corruption.\n\nThird, strategic resource management should balance national sovereignty with economic pragmatism to maximise benefits from Zimbabwes mineral wealth. Moving away from disadvantageous long-term trade agreements while avoiding excessive nationalisation will help Zimbabwe capture fair value during price fluctuations without deterring necessary investment. Central to this approach is the need for long-term planning that addresses resource depletion through economic diversification strategies and sovereign wealth mechanisms, on condition that these be well governed.\n\nFourth, community empowerment andrights protection regarding land and watershould be prioritised to ensure that local populations benefit from, and participate in, decisions affecting their areas. There is a need for ongoing, comprehensive government and civil society-driven capacity building programmes to educate people about critical minerals, associated opportunities and potential risks, enabling informed participation in mining-related decisions. Community involvement is a principle provided for by the Constitution on national development, and in theEnvironmental Management Actt. But the implementation of these provisions remains a problem.\n\nIn this respect, international best practice frameworks such as theVoluntary Principles on Security and Human Rightsprovide useful guidelines on how mining companies, civil society and government can play a role in advancing these goals. But creating the conditions under which these can be effectively implemented will require the Zimbabwean government to address long-run governance and human rights issues, as well as creating an enabling environment for civil society to operate.\n\nFinally, environmental sustainability and social responsibility must guide Zimbabwes approach to critical mineral extraction, ensuring that the pursuit of economic benefits does not compromise long-term environmental and social well-being, particularly for the mining communities. Mining operations should be required to adopt cleaner technologies and implement robust mitigation measures, including cleaner coal technologies, where fossil fuels remain necessary for processing.\n\nHumanising the broader energy transition can be achieved through gradual, community-sensitive steps rather than disruptive changes that harm rural livelihoods.\n\nUpgrading Zimbabwes obsolete energy infrastructure is essential for supporting both mining operations and broader economic development while improving national energy security. By embedding environmental and social considerations into mining policies from the outset, Zimbabwe can position itself as a responsible supplier of critical minerals while building a sustainable foundation for long-term development that benefits all citizens rather than perpetuating historical patterns of exploitation and exclusion.\n\nSikhululekile Mashingaidze is the lead researcher in Good Governance Africas Peace and Security Programme and Stephen Buchanan-Clarke is the head of the programme.\n\n",

            "content": "Cape Town Etc\n\nThe luxury rail industry across Southern Africa held its breath earlier this year when a Rovos Rail train carrying 47 foreign tourists and 34 staff members collided with a freight train on the Bulawayo-Beitbridge line.\n\nNow, after months of investigation and reflection, the companys Chief Operating Officer Tiffany Vos-Thane has broken her silence about what went wrong that fateful morning,Cape {town} Etcreports.\n\nThis incident marked the first major accident in Rovos Rails 20 years of operation along this route, shaking confidence in Africas luxury rail sector.\n\nThe collision derailed several carriages during the Easter holiday journey to Victoria Falls, tragically claiming the life of one staff member weeks later due to medical complications.\n\nWhile no passengers were physically injured, the psychological impact on both guests and crew has been profound, with the company arranging ongoing trauma counselling for affected employees.\n\nAccording toVos-Thane, while final reports are still being compiled, preliminary findings point squarely to a tragic miscalculation by Bulawayo Beitbridge Railway (BBR) operators.\n\nSomebody made a mistake with the timing, which is just so unfortunate, Vos-Thane revealed in an emotional interview. This is particularly devastating considering we use this line twice weekly without incident. Losing a team member has left us grappling with difficult questions, though we must acknowledge this was an isolated failure in an otherwise reliable system.\n\nMeanwhile, the COO praised the extraordinary emergency response from Zimbabwean authorities, with medical teams and railway officials arriving within minutes. This rapid intervention likely prevented further casualties among the shaken passengers and crew.\n\nSurprisingly, the accident appears to have done little to dampen enthusiasm for Rovos Rails luxury experiences. The company reports receiving just one customer query about line safety since the incident, with demand remaining robust despite global economic uncertainties affecting the travel sector.\n\nA recent Tourism Update poll supports this resilience, with 73% of industry respondents affirming luxury travels enduring appeal. Vos-Thane attributes this to Southern Africas stringent rail safety regulations across all ten countries Rovos operates in, which require annual safety permits for all operators.\n\nAddressing concerns about regional rail infrastructure, the COO acknowledged challenges like loadshedding and cable theft causing delays, particularly on South Africas Pretoria-Cape Town route. However, she noted an 80% improvement in timings recently and expressed optimism about government moves toward rail privatisation.\n\nThe more private investment in our railways, the better the infrastructure becomes, Vos-Thane stated. While billions are needed for full rehabilitation, were seeing promising commitment from authorities.\n\nRather than expanding its fleet of 23 locomotives (including eight electric and four hybrids), Rovos Rail will focus on refurbishing existing carriages and elevating service standards. This quality-over-quantity approach aims to reinforce the brands premium positioning while implementing lessons from Aprils tragedy.\n\nThe company continues working closely with BBR to prevent future timing errors, though Vos-Thane stressed such incidents remain exceptionally rare in African luxury rail travel.\n\nFor now, the iconic trains keep rolling across the continents spectacular landscape, carrying travellers seeking unforgettable journeys through Southern Africas heart.\n\n",
