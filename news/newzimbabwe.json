He was the face of the March 31 protest, which later morphed to a mass stay-away.\n\nZanu PF National Political Commissar Munyaradzi Machacha\n\nIn a video posted by Zanu PF apparatchiks on social media while addressing party members at an undisclosed location, Machacha reveals that he is related to Geza, who is his uncle and, therefore, speaks authoritatively of a person he has known for years.\n\nI acknowledge that Geza is my uncle. You heard him rant that l am his nephew, yes, its true. I am not speaking of a person that l am not familiar with. We were together at Chimoio during the war, said Machacha.\n\nHe went further to allege the staunch Mnangagwa critic never spent a single day at Chimoio Camp but engrossed himself in stealing from the logistics warehouse and reselling goods to villagers from nearby settlements.\n\nThere was a big hall which served as a logistics warehouse where clothes for guerilla fighters were stored. Bombshell would go there and steal jeans and shirts, which he would go and sell in the villages or exchange for beer or cigarettes.\n\nHe literally never spent a single day in camp. Each morning, he would go around villages and get chicken, beer cigarettes and Saraveji, claimed Machacha.\n\nHe further claimed that despite the corporal punishment Geza received, including flogging on the buttocks by security details at the camp, he was unrepentant.\n\nMachacha explained that following Gezas recruitment for training in Romania he displayed his dishonesty and penchant for finer things in life prompting him to misrepresent to Romanian authorities that he was nationalist Robert Mugabes son and was accorded Very Important Person (VIP) treatment.\n\nThe correct fact was that Gezas elder brother was married to Mugabes sister.\n\nHe would be chauffeured in limousines around Romania, said Machacha.\n\nUpon Independence in 1980, the commissar went on, Geza was enlisted into the army where he would beg to get promotion not based on merit.\n\nMachacha claimed at one time during the Mozambican military operation, Geza tricked FRELIMO soldiers whom he intoxicated before stripping their Scania trucks of their engines, which he smuggled into Zimbabwe.\n\nAmong other charges, Geza was accused of raiding white commercial farmers of their cattle during the land reform and grabbing abattoirs, where he would slaughter the stolen beasts for sale.\n\nAlso, during the Chiadzwa diamond rush, Geza was appointed Mbada Diamonds security officer and looted the mineral, Machacha said.\n\nThe commissar claims Gezas beef with President Mnangagwa stems from the formers disqualification from contesting the 2018 elections to represent Sanyati constituency because he had a pending rape case involving a local school girl.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner atMadzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. This week we want to discuss regulatory sandboxes for fintech start-ups in Zimbabwe. What is a regulatory sandbox, and why is it necessary for fintech start-ups in Zimbabwe?\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nYour question is in 2 parts, I will start by explaining what a fintech is before I attempt to explain a regulatory sandbox for the fintech industry and why it is necessary for fintech start-ups in Zimbabwe.\n\nA fintech is a company that relies mainly, if not solely, on technology and cloud services to provide financial services to its customers. It is not limited by the need to have your traditional brick and mortar to be able to provide these services. Services that may be provided by such fintech solutions include payments, savings, investments, borrowing of finances and many others. The idea being to make it easier and accessible for the consumer to transact and benefit from such services.\n\nSandboxes, on the other hand, are controlled or isolated testing environments that allow innovators to test their new product or service without the burdensome requirement of complying with all applicable regulations affecting that particular product.\n\nAnd now to the why of your question. Complying with financial regulations may in some instances prove to be expensive for a start-up fintech company and the use of a sandbox allows the start up to speed up entry into the market, identify and hopefully mitigate, if not remedy, any risk that would have potentially bedevilled the start-up following a straight to market launch in the absence of a sandbox.\n\nReporter: What is the difference thenbetweena regulatory sandbox and an innovation hub?\n\nVM: Innovation hubs, in general terms, involve the sharing of ideas between innovators and or with their regulators, which may include guidance on regulations by the regulators as they work on providing solutions to the problems in that sector. Sandboxes allow for the actual experimentation of how the product will work in a live market without necessarily being subjected to the obligation of adhering to prevailing regulations for market entry.\n\nReporter:Is Zimbabwe conducive for a Fintech sandbox?\n\nVM: Well, these fintech sandboxes are a common trend in the world and particularly in Africa. Traditionally, Zimbabwe has proved to be adaptive to new methods of utilizing financial technology. The country remains conducive because the economy is heavily reliant on cash for transactions and a significant percentage of the population is unbanked and operating their businesses outside the formal financial channels, providing such sandboxes encourages more innovators to bring out products that may mop the unbanked liquidity into the formal market with the added benefit of including this unbanked demography into the beneficial financial services offered to the formalized market.\n\nReporter:In Zimbabwe, which laws regulate fintech sandboxes?\n\nVM: We have the Fintech Regulatory Guidelines of 2021 from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, which, among other things, provide guidance and requirements for potential participants to test their products in a live environment while at the same time prioritizing consumer safety and protection.\n\nThe guidelines also encourage collaboration between the startup fintechs and the traditional financial sector, in which the innovative technology intends to improve by the launch of their product.\n\nWe also have the Securities and Exchange Commission of Zimbabwe Regulatory Sandbox guidelines of 2024 which are aimed at facilitating capital market fintech innovations.\n\nReporter: What are the real benefits of the sandbox and is it useful?\n\nVM: Besides the obvious benefit of reducing the cost to the innovator in the testing phase, which is about 24 months, it allows constant interaction between the innovator and the regulator, creating an environment where the regulator understands the operations of the fintech product. This will prove highly useful should there be a need to lobby for policy changes to accommodate disruptive technology.\n\nI am also personally of the view that the sandbox allows for easier fundraising as there will be a clear blueprint of how the product works, plus the common hurdle of regulatory approval will have been passed and consumer appetite tested.\n\nReporter: How is an innovator assured that the innovation will not be distributed to competitors during the application and testing periods?\n\nVM: The Reserve Bank guidelines on Fintech Regulatory sandbox provide that all information provided by the innovator will be treated as confidential and any disclosure to any third party will first require the approval of the innovator unless the disclosure has been ordered by a court order or under any law.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima, we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

Authorities allege that conduct occurred between 2021 and 2024.\n\nCombs was previously charged with racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution related to three victims and one count of sex trafficking related only to Victim-1. He now faces five federal charges.\n\nJury selection for his trial is scheduled to start on May 5. Combs has pleaded not guilty.\n\nWhen reached for comment, lawyers for Combs said, These are not new allegations or new accusers. These are the same individuals, former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships. This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion.\n\nThey allege Combs and his associates used his position of power to coerce women, often under the pretense of a romantic relationship, into engaging in sex acts, according to the indictment.\n\nProsecutors said during these encounters, known as Freak Offs, women were drugged and forced to have sex with male prostitutes. The Freaks Offs often lasted days and were video recorded, the indictment alleges.\n\nCombs lawyers have maintained no crimes were committed and the sexual encounters were consensual and part of a long-term relationship.\n\nCombs is also accused of reacting violently when his authority was threatened. On one occasion, the indictment says, Combs allegedly dangled a victim over an apartment balcony and was involved in kidnapping and arson.\n\nProsecutors also revealed in a new court filing that four accusers are expected to testify at the trial.\n\nVictim-1, who was Combs long-term girlfriend, is planning to testify under her real name. Prosecutors have asked that three other alleged victims be allowed to testify under pseudonyms.\n\nThis case has already received an exceptional amount of media coverage, which will presumably only increase as trial proceeds. Permitting these measures will prevent unnecessary public disclosure of the victims identities, and the harassment from the media and others, they wrote in a court filing Friday.\n\nIn addition, prosecutors said, publicizing the names of these three victims will cause them significant embarrassment, anxiety, and social stigma. The accusers have said they are concerned that their testimony would impact their personal relationships and future employment, the government said.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the accusers identities are known to Combs and his lawyers.\n\nJudges have allowed accusers to testify using nicknames or pseudonyms in other high-profile cases, including the sex trafficking trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epsteins former girlfriend and accomplice.\n\n",

            "content": "By Bang Showbiz\n\nBARACK Obama opens up about the challenges he faced in his marriage to Michelle after their time in the White House, revealing a deep deficit and how he has worked to reconnect with her.\n\nBarack claims he was in a deep deficit with his wife Michelle Obama after leaving the White House.\n\nBarack, 63, served two terms as US President between 2009 and 2017 and claims they took a toll on his relationship with former First Lady Michelle, 61.\n\nThe Daily Beast reports that Obama told an audience at Hamilton College: I was in a deep deficit with my wife.\n\nSo, I have been trying to dig myself out of that hole by doing occasionally fun things.\n\nThe Obamas have been married since 1992, and have daughters Malia, 26, and Sasha, 23, together.\n\nThey have previously admitted that the presidency affected their marriage, with Michelle once revealing there was a time when she couldnt stand her husband.\n\nSpeaking to Revolt TV, she said: People think Im being catty by saying this  its like, there were 10 years where I couldnt stand my husband. And guess when it happened? When those kids were little.\n\nWhen asked about Michelles comments, Barack told CBS Mornings: Let me just say this: it sure helps to be out of the White House. And to have a little more time with her.\n\nMichelle  when our girls were growing up, that was priority number one, two, three and four. And so, I did not fully appreciate, I think, as engaged of a father as I was, the degree of stress and tension for her, knowing that not just me and Michelle were under scrutiny and in this strange environment, but that we were raising our daughters in a kind of situation that just wasnt normal.\n\nMichelle met Barack in 1989 when she was 25 and he was 28, while both were working at the Sidley Austin LLP law firm in Chicago.\n\nThe former president asked Michelle on a date within a month of meeting, and they became engaged in 1991.\n\nThey married the following year and later had two daughters, Malia in 1998 and Sasha in 2001.\n\nBaracks political career began in earnest in 2004 when he was elected as an Illinois state senator, bringing the family into the public eye.\n\nIn 2008, he was elected the 44th president of the United States and won re-election in 2012.\n\n",

I am Geza! On the 31st, the country will be fine. Mnangagwa is a (genital organ). You have caused the death of people in the country, ZLHR said.\n\nGeza had called for protests on March 31 to demand Mnangagwas immediate resignation, however, the highly anticipated demonstrations largely turned into a nationwide stay-away.\n\nMachakaire is one of several people who have been arrested and prosecuted across Zimbabwe for allegedly undermining the authority of or insulting President Mnangagwa.\n\n",
