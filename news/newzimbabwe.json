Why do they want to partner on this facility, which is almost complete? he said.\n\nIn 2022, giant energy company Sakunda Holdings approached council with an offer to have a lease agreement on the facility, but was turned down.\n\n",

Police brutality and political purges targeting opposition members and concerned citizens are rampant. Vital institutions are being hijacked by individuals to serve their interests, and undermining the foundations of our society, he said.\n\nThe opposition leader accused the governments policies of creating a stark divide, leaving the majority impoverished and the economy on a freefall, which has escalated citizens hardship.\n\nWe also discussed the internal instability in Zanu PF and its potential to further destabilise the country. We are preparing for all possible outcomes, and we are determined to ensure that any power vacuum is filled by a government that represents the will of the people, he added.\n\n",

Baba challenged us both that day to do bigger things for Africa stuff you guys can now do!\n\nThe turning point came when he attended a panel discussion where multiple speakers claimed Africa would remain a mere consumer of AI because the cost of computing power was beyond the continents reach.\n\nSitting there, I thought to myself, If Aliko can raise $19 billion, surely I should be able to raise a few billion dollars to get AI Compute started in Africa. After all, we already have most of the key components right here in our own companies!\n\nMasiyiwa revealed that when he later mentioned his idea to Dangote and their mutual friend, Prof Benedict Oramah, the President of Afreximbank, they both encouraged him to pursue it.\n\nWhen I mentioned this to Aliko the next time we met, this time together with our friend Prof Oramah of Afreximbank, they were egging me on to do it.\n\nMy brother, you got this. Its your field now. If you cant do it, then who? Aliko joked before adding: Dont forget Nigeria!\n\nProf [as we call Prof Oramah] as usual just said, We are always there for you as Afreximbank, even though you will also have to go global for such funding. Thats how he has spoken to me for over 30 years now,Masiyiwa said.\n\nNow, in partnership with Nvidia, Masiyiwas Cassava Technologies is launching Project Mufungi, an initiative that will establish high-performance AI computing infrastructure across Africa.\n\nOur AI factory provides the infrastructure for this innovation to scale, empowering African businesses, startups, and researchers with access to cutting-edge AI infrastructure to turn their bold ideas into real-world breakthroughs. And now they dont have to look beyond Africa to get it,Masiyiwa said.\n\nThe move also comes amid increasing interest in Africas digital infrastructure from global technology firms.\n\nWith backing from partners like Nvidia and Afreximbank, the project is expected to catalyze further investments in Africas digital economy, helping to close the AI divide between the continent and the rest of the world.\n\n",

The civic money not exceed US$1 per child, reads part of the letter.\n\nHowever, ARTUZ has vehemently criticised the Ministry of Educations use of civic days as a fundraising strategy, arguing that these celebrations have been reduced to partisan Zanu-PF events.\n\nThey maintain that, whilst many value the sacrifices made in liberating Zimbabwe, they can no longer associate themselves with these events. To ARTUZ, the situation smacks of political opportunism.\n\nARTUZ further suggested that the independence celebrations would provide fertile ground for Mnangagwas supporters, the 2030ists, to further their agenda of keeping him in power beyond his constitutional term limit, which is expected to end in 2028.\n\nIt is unethical and illegal for the government to force schools to fund the partisan junket dedicated to the violation of the constitution, ARTUZ wrote on X.\n\nZimbabwes schools are severely underfunded because of governments neglect. The parents are bearing the burden of funding education in violation of section 75 of the Constitution which mandates the government to provide state funded basic education.\n\nIt is cruel for Mnangagwas government to extract from the incapacitated schools. We urge school heads to refuse to participate in this illegality. We stand ready to defend our schools from abuse.\n\nFormer Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) party spokesperson commented that Zanu-PF has reduced key events into internal partisan programmes, making it difficult for other citizens to participate.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the state and the party are conflated.

And were not just talking about it.\n\nWorld Athletics is looking at cheek swab tests but is also considering using blood spot tests.\n\nThe test for the SRY gene, which is almost always on the male Y chromosome and is used as a highly accurate proxy for biological sex, would need to be taken just once by an athlete during their career, the federation says.\n\nCoe warned during his campaign to be elected International Olympic Committee president that we run the risk of losing womens sport unless the female category was protected.\n\nThe Briton finished third in the race last week which was won byKirsty Coventry, the former Olympic swimmer from Zimbabwe.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nThe Duke of Sussex has announced his resignation as a patron of Sentebale, a Lesotho-based British charity which he co-founded, after a row between the trustees and the chair of its board.\n\nPrince Harry said he had stepped down alongside co-founder and fellow patron Prince Seeiso of Lesotho and Sentebales board of trustees after Dr Sophie Chandaukas relationship with the trustees broke down beyond repair and she sued the charity after she was asked to step down.\n\nDr Chandauka has reported the charity to the UK Charity Commission. She said she had blown the whistle about abuse of power and harassment, and said her work was in pursuit of the integrity of the organisation.\n\nThe Charity Commission says it is aware of concerns about the governance of Sentebale and is looking into them.\n\nSentebale was founded by Prince Harry and Prince Seeiso in 2006 with a focus on addressing the effects of HIV and Aids on young people in the southern African nations of Lesotho and Botswana.\n\nIn a joint statement, the princes said: With heavy hearts, we have resigned from our roles as Patrons of the organisation until further notice, in support of and solidarity with the board of trustees who have had to do the same.\n\nIt is devastating that the relationship between the charitys trustees and the chair of the board broke down beyond repair, creating an untenable situation.\n\nThese trustees acted in the best interest of the charity in asking the chair to step down, while keeping the wellbeing of staff in mind. In turn, she sued the charity to remain in this voluntary position, further underscoring the broken relationship.\n\nThey would, they added, be sharing all of our concerns with the Charity Commission as to how this came about.\n\nFormer trustees Timothy Boucher, Mark Dyer, Audrey Kgosidintsi, Dr Kelello Lerotholi and Damian West described their decision as nothing short of devastating for all of them.\n\nThey said they had lost trust and confidence in the chairwoman but her legal action meant they had no other option than to resign in the best interest of the charity, as it could not take on the legal and financial burden.\n\nThis was not a choice willingly made, but rather something we felt forced into in order to look after the charity, they said.\n\nDr Chandauka said her work at Sentebale had been guided by the principles of fairness and equitable treatment for all, regardless of social status or financial means.\n\nThere are people in this world who behave as though they are above the law and mistreat people, and then play the victim card and use the very press they disdain to harm people who have the courage to challenge their conduct, she added.\n\nThis, she said, was the story of a woman who dared to blow the whistle about issues of poor governance, weak executive management, abuse of power, bullying, harassment, misogyny, misogynoir  and the coverup that ensued.\n\nThe charity itself said it had not received resignations from either Royal Patron but it did confirm a restructuring of its board on Tuesday to bring in more experts with the capabilities and networks to accelerate Sentebales transformation agenda.\n\nIt said that it had announced plans last April to move from being a development organisation addressing the impact of HIV and Aids on children and young people in Lesotho and Botswana to one that is addressing issues of youth health, wealth and climate resilience in Southern Africa.\n\nThe recalibration of the Board is, therefore, part of Sentebales ambitious transformation agenda, the charity added.\n\nThe Charity Commission said it was aware of concerns over Sentebales governance, adding: We are assessing the issues to determine the appropriate regulatory steps.\n\n",
