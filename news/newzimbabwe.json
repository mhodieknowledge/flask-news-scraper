Zambia and Zimbabwe are among the hardest hit countries, facing frequent power outages due to reduced water levels in Lake Kariba, which have caused a 25% drop in hydroelectric output.\n\nParticipants are expected to review the progress of the Mission 300 initiative, a project backed by the World Bank and African Development Bank that aims to expand energy access to 600 million people in the region by 2030, with the first target being 300 million.\n\nThe agenda also includes discussions on developing the petroleum and gas sectors, as well as adopting emerging technologies such as green hydrogen and smart grids. The Ministers will consider recommendations from a recent regional dialogue on ensuring a just transition to sustainable energy in Southern Africa.\n\nOn the water front, the meeting will evaluate advances in transboundary water management projects, led by River Basin Organisations and other shared institutions, including groundwater and livelihood support programmes.\n\nProfessor Obert Jiri, Permanent Secretary in Zimbabwes Ministry of Lands, Agriculture and Water Development and Chair of the water officials committee, highlighted the critical link between energy and water resources.\n\nSolar power and energy recovered from landfill gases demonstrate the close relationship between water and energy, he said. Managing water resources effectively is vital, not just for energy generation but also as a response to climate change. A small rise in temperature can significantly reduce water availability in our region, affecting agriculture and livelihoods.\n\nHe added that this meeting is crucial for exploring ways to improve water access for irrigation and energy production, both of which are essential for the regions development.\n\n",
