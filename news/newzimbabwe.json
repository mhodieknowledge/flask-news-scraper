The victim sustained multiple stab wounds and was rushed to Tshilidzini Hospital, where he later died in the early hours of Saturday, 4 October.\n\nPolice have identified the suspect as Richard Chiraira, who fled the scene and remains on the run. The case, initially registered as attempted murder, has since been updated to murder.\n\nA manhunt is underway, and we are appealing to anyone with information to assist the police in locating the suspect, said provincial police spokesperson Colonel Malesela Ledwaba.\n\nInvestigations into the incident are ongoing.\n\nLast month, IOL reported that police in Limpopo launched an investigation into a suspected mob justice incident after the body of a man, believed to be a Zimbabwean national, was discovered in Mooihoek, Driekop. The victim, who is thought to be in his 30s, was found with severe injuries consistent with a brutal assault.\n\nPolice responded to a report of a murder, and on arrival, they discovered the mans body with multiple injuries, believed to have been inflicted with stones and bottles. Paramedics declared him dead at the scene.\n\nAt the time, police in the province confirmed that the motive for the killing was under investigation and appealed for the publics help.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nFORMER Energy minister Fortune Chasi has called on Zimbabweans to stop blaming Chinese for environmental degradation, arguing that local corruption and weak governance are at the heart of the countrys mining-related ecological damage.\n\nChasi was responding to growing outrage over the ongoing destruction of Christmas Pass Mountain in Mutare, where the Chinese reportedly working in collusion with political elites are accused of tearing apart the landmark for mineral extraction.\n\nThere have been various videos on social media showing the destruction going on in the Christmas Pass Mountain with locals accusing the Chinese of damaging the scenic environment.\n\nThis comes at a time when mountains, monuments and escarpments are being destroyed countrywide by Chinese companies in the mining sector with examples being Boterekwa in Shurugwi, Muvaradonha Wilderness in Muzarabani and now Christmas Pass.\n\nResponding to one of the debates on X, Chasi said while Chinese investors are often vilified for destructive mining practices, the real problem lies with local officials who enable such activities for personal gain.\n\nFor years, we have blamed the Chinese for destroying our environment through mining, but the truth is harder to face, the real culprits are locals.\n\nLocal officials sign the licences, local elites pocket the facilitation fees. Local silence allows rivers to turn into sludge. The Chinese did not corrupt our system, they found it already for sale, Chasi wrote.\n\nThe former energy minister argued that environmental destruction in Zimbabwe reflects a broader governance crisis rather than foreign exploitation alone.\n\nThis isnt a Chinese problem. It is a governance problem. If rules can be bought, someones selling, he added.\n\nEvery destroyed riverbed tells a local story, a signature, a bribe, a blind eye. Foreign miners only exploit the vacuum we created.\n\nBlaming outsiders has become a fashionable, convenient self-deception. Environmental destruction thrives because enforcement is selective and oversight compromised, Chasi wrote.\n\nThe reform we need is not about nationality; it is about integrity.\n\nUntil our institutions stop trading ecological integrity for quick cash, nothing will change. The Chinese did not destroy our mountains and rivers. Our signatures did, he added.\n\n",

What this means is that the appellant never disputed the terms of the contract as spelt out by the respondent and never disputed breaching the contract.\n\nThe church had paid Rockshade for the hire of a new 60-seater bus to transport congregants to a seminar in Botswana.\n\nBut it later discovered the company only had a single 50-seater already hired out. Rockshade then offered an old 57-seater bus instead  a move that left the church with 60 confirmed travellers but only 57 seats.\n\nMCZ described the replacement bus as very old, with worn seats, a dirty fridge and toilet, and earmarked for scrapping. The court said this amounted to a clear breach.\n\nBy refusing to avail the 60-seater bus (having earlier misrepresented to the respondent that it had the bus), the appellant repudiated the contract, the judgment stated.\n\nThe respondent acted properly in suing for a refund the moment the appellant indicated its unwillingness to be bound by the terms of the contract.\n\nThe High Court partially allowed the appeal only to remove a Magistrates Court directive that the refund be paid within 24 hours, ruling instead that Rockshade must simply pay the money and costs of suit.\n\nAll other grounds of appeal are red herrings. Nothing turns on them,Chikowero ruled.\n\nEach party was ordered to bear its own costs of the appeal.\n\n",

Stay focused. Im fully aware of the huge responsibility and heavy burden upon my shoulders. And I will never let you down or fall short, Chamisa said.\n\nThe veteran politician-turned-advocate blamed his unnamed political foes, whom he accuses of attempting to arm-twist him into divulging information about his political strategy, almost two years after resigning from the CCC party presidency.\n\nBear in mind that not all strategic decisions are shared openly or with the opposite team. Information is a strategic resource never to be shared recklessly. As for you who believe and support; worry not, fear not, doubt not and more importantly, be confused not.\n\nIn his characteristic style, Chamisa reassured Zimbabweans that better days for the country lie ahead.\n\nBe clear and of good cheer. You will soon appreciate the wisdom of my ways. Victory and success never come cheap. Every action I take, every decision I make, is focused on achieving our great and glorious future for Zimbabwe.\n\nHe insisted that his focus remains on building Zimbabwe.\n\nMy hands are on the deck, my eyes on the vision and mission. The struggle continues, and I remain steadfast, fully committed to the work that cannot pause for idle distractions.\n\nIt is understood that Chamisa is working on a new and soon-to-be-launched political movement, a new vehicle for the 2028 elections, nearly two years after stepping down as CCC party President.\n\nThe opposition activist is also reportedly steering clear of commenting on Zanu-PFs internal succession battles.\n\nHe has been accused on social media of inaction as a politician and a leader that people expect to lead Zimbabwe.\n\nCritics have pointed to what they view as the clerics obsession with scripture, which they claim is the biggest weakness of the former Kuwadzana East MP as a leader.\n\n",
