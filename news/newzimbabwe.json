            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nINHABITANTS of Mberengwa in Midlands province have implored Parliament to translate the Mines and Minerals Bill to local languages in order to empower communities to address problems bedeviling them through meaningful input when public hearings kick off.\n\nThe Bill, which has gone through several twists and turns since 2015, is seen as a signal marking the departure from the archaic colonial legislation last promulgated in 1961, leaving gaps which the mining companies have taken advantage of over the years.The document was gazetted in June 2025 under General Notice 1243A of 2025 by Clerk of Parliament, Kennedy Chokuda, in terms of Standing Order No.142 (1) of the National Assembly.Speaking during the Silveira House organised district environmental impact assessment dialogue this week, Mberengwa Ward 10 Councillor, Devilious Mashavakure called on Parliament to set out its systems for widespread circulation.Parliament must strive to overcome the language barriers in communities hardest hit by mining activities. The English jargon used in law is often confusing hence the urgent need to roll it out in local languages.So far we appreciate the role being played by community based publications in conscientising the Mberengwa local residents, he said.Mashavakure urged stakeholders and Parliament to work expeditiously and pave the way for the finalisation of the Bill as soon as possible as a strategy to stop the current rampant environmental damage before it goes offhand.Merengwa Ward 16 Councillor, Lovemore Nkomo expressed gratitude over the clauses in the Bill saying it has the potential to address the bulk of problems bedeviling the mining sector.He said the neo-colonial agenda contained in the 1961 Mines and Minerals Act could be a thing of the past once the Bill sails through. He underscored that the document needs to be circulated in local languages way on time ahead of public hearings.Alder Makotore, an Environmental Sub Committee member in the same district implored Parly to urgently insert issues that affect women in mining communities such as destruction of water sources, eradicating sexual harassment, which are not so prominent in Bill.She said mechanisms which guaranteed womens participation during the forthcoming public hearings exercises must be put in place.Silveira House project manager for community-led mining advocacy and governance, Zandile Mvududu said while the Bill presents opportunities to address legacy problems in the mining sector, the Portfolio Committee on Mines must be geared to receive overwhelming feedback from residents.With the Environmental Social Governance (ESG) focus in most mining communities which have been influenced by the efforts to minimise the ESG risks, we feel that the Bill has gained so much momentum in the communities, she said.\n\nThe Bill, which has gone through several twists and turns since 2015, is seen as a signal marking the departure from the archaic colonial legislation last promulgated in 1961, leaving gaps which the mining companies have taken advantage of over the years.\n\nThe document was gazetted in June 2025 under General Notice 1243A of 2025 by Clerk of Parliament, Kennedy Chokuda, in terms of Standing Order No.142 (1) of the National Assembly.Speaking during the Silveira House organised district environmental impact assessment dialogue this week, Mberengwa Ward 10 Councillor, Devilious Mashavakure called on Parliament to set out its systems for widespread circulation.Parliament must strive to overcome the language barriers in communities hardest hit by mining activities.

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nTHE Government of Zimbabwe intends to tighten gun licensing and deal with criminals using illegal firearms to kill innocent citizens.\n\nA legislator raised a concern over the abuse of unregistered guns by criminals committing murders around the country.During a Question-and-Answer session this Wednesday, MP Thomas Muwodzeri queried government policy regarding illegal firearms being used to maim innocent people.What is government policy with regards to the use of unauthorised guns that are being used by criminals to kill business people? Muwodzeri said.The MPs call comes after this weeks mysterious murder of prominent businessman Joseph Mutangaz Mutangadura (67) who was gunned down at his Lisheen Estate in Ruwa late last Sunday.Joseph Mutangaz MutangaduraActing leader of government business in Parliament Anxious Masuka said guns have to be registered.Guns have to be licenced. I know the ministry has requested that more punitive measures be meted on those found to be in possession of illegal firearms, and not just in possession, but it is also worrisome to hear that those firearms are used to commit robberies and some of those culminating in murders, Masuka said.However, Masuka highlighted to Speaker Jacob Mudenda that because of the gravity of the matter, licenced or unlicenced guns can be used for robberies and to commit murder, hence a research on the veracity of the issue should be done.Referring to the question by Muwodzeri, the minister responded: This is a very worrisome development.

It will be decentralised in all our central hospitals, as you are aware that all our central hospitals have specialists who can perform these surgeries.\n\nWhat is now hindering them is the modern equipment to use for that, but definitely with time, we are going to make sure that it is going to be done to our locals and to our people for free, said Kwidi.\n\nThe lack of medical equipment in major public hospitals has left many citizens to seek treatment outside the country.\n\nHowever, the poor who cannot afford specialised treatment in foreign countries and private medical facilities have to contend with the dire services in public hospitals.\n\nKwidini made a bold assertion that the government is addressing the countrys healthcare systems.\n\nWith that, as per our policy, we want to make sure that these trained specialist doctors locally are going to be capacitated, especially with the tools of trade.\n\nThat is why we have seen now that our President has moved to the mantra to say, let us renovate our health institutions into the modern systems to ensure that we are able to do the specialised treatment which people are seeking on these major operations, especially in India and other countries, said Kwidini.\n\n",
