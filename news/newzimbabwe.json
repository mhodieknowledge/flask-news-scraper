            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Southern African Development Community (SADC) Chairperson, Emmerson Mnangagwa has marked the Southern Africa Liberation Day by honouring the sacrifices of the regions freedom fighters.\n\nThe day celebrated on 23 March annually, serves as a tribute to Africans who fought for independence, democracy, and sovereignty.\n\nIn a statement, Mnangagwa called on citizens to remain vigilant against threats to their independence.\n\nI urge us all, as independent peoples of SADC, to remain vigilant and be alert to the emerging challenges that threaten our hard-won independence and the general stability of our region.\n\nWe must, continue to stand in solidarity against the imposition of illegal sanctions, use of coercive measures and or any other actions that undermine our sovereignty and territorial integrity, he said.\n\nThe 82-year-old Zimbabwean leader waved solidarity with the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic, indicating that a free Africa will be attained after the Western Sahara gets its freedom.\n\nOn this historic day, we also remember our brothers and sisters in the Saharawi Arab Democratic Republic, who are still being denied the right to determine their own destiny. Africa will not be free, until the Western Sahara, is liberated, free and independent.\n\nFurther, Mnangagwa called for the total silencing of guns in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nSADC remains a relatively calm and peaceful region. For this, we are proud. However, I reiterate our call for lasting peace in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The situation in Eastern DRC undermines the aspirations bequeathed to us by our Founding Fathers and outlined in the SADC Constitutive Act and Vision 2050.\n\nThe time to silence the guns, de-escalate tensions and hostilities as well as to engage in dialogue to secure mediated outcomes for long-lasting peace in DRC is now, said Mnangagwa.\n\nMeanwhile, the SADC chairperson flagged the need to develop modernised equipment to detect droughts as Africa has been impacted by the unpredicted climate change.\n\nOver the years, our region, has been greatly affected by recurring climate change induced disasters, leading to far reaching consequences for our people, economies, and environment.\n\nThe extreme weather patterns have resulted in frequent and severe droughts, threatening food security and livelihoods across our region.\n\nIt is our collective responsibility to take decisive action to mitigate and manage the effects of these natural disasters. To this end, the need to enhance our early warning capabilities, build resilience and adaptation capacities, leveraging on the deployment of science, technology and innovation cannot be over-emphasised, said Mnangagwa.\n\n",

            "content": "By ESPN Cricinfo\n\nFORMER Zimbabwe captain Brendan Taylor, currently serving a three-and-half-year ban for breaching the ICCs anti-corruption code, is eyeing an international comeback when his sanction ends in July.\n\nTaylor, 39, had initially considered a move into coaching but has been convinced to resume his playing career by Zimbabwe Crickets MD Givemore Makoni, with a view to playing the 2027 ODI World Cup, which Zimbabwe will co-host. Taylor will be eligible to play again on July 25 this year.\n\nI still want to play, and I believe I could make an impact as a player, Taylor told ESPNcricinfo.\n\nI look at where Im at physically and mentally and if I didnt feel I could do it, I wouldnt bother. Givemore has really supported me on this. He sort of shut down the coaching role for now and said, Can you play and try to push yourself up until the 2027 World Cup? Granted Ill be 41 then but with sobriety, Im living my truest form.\n\nTaylor admitted to drug and alcohol addiction problem at the same time he revealed an approach by match-fixers to spot fix after they filmed him using cocaine. He was threatened with the video being made public if he did not cooperate with them. Instead of going through with the fix, Taylor abruptly retired from international cricket in September 2021 and did not reveal the reasons. He only reported the incident to the ICC four months later and made the story public in January 2022.\n\nAt that point, Taylor also checked himself into a rehabilitation centre in Zimbabwes Nyanga region on the Mozambique border. He spent 90 days there, with one other patient and a sponsor who showed me a new way to live. He has since been clean and has started a private coaching facility at his home as well as, more recently, a gradual return to training.\n\nThe conditions of his sanction mean Taylor cannot play any officially recognised cricket or train with domestic or international sides. Instead, he has been using facilities at an elite independent school, St Johns College in Harare, often twice a day.\n\nTheyve got some great grass nets, and I spend a lot of time in the indoor high-performance centre there. I get in there nice and early, and I come back in the afternoon and do it all again and push myself, Taylor said.\n\nTheres lots of work to do, but I feel like Im there. Im not far off. Ive been doing some batting, and I need to incorporate some fielding and some keeping work because Ive got four months to go.\n\nAlthough it would have been great to be able to, Taylor will not be cleared to play by the time of Zimbabwes Test in England in May  their first against that opposition in more than two decades. But he hopes to be in the plans for a home series against New Zealand in August.\n\nThat will be followed by Zimbabwes hosting of the Africa Regional Qualifiers for next years T20 World Cup in September, though Taylor feels he has some work to do on his T20 game, where he has a strike rate of 123.96.\n\nI see myself definitely playing Tests and ODIs. With T20s, thats probably something I would have to really try and sharpen myself up at. But I look forward to that.\n\nHaving a home World Cup is quite special and weve had some heartache over these last few World Cups so hopefully we can turn that around.\n\nShould his comeback be successful, Taylor will be the fourth player in the Zimbabwe side in his late 30s, after Test and ODI captain Craig Ervine (39), T20I captain Sikandar Raza (38), and long-serving allrounder Sean Williams (also 38). Its in watching their performances that Taylor has found the belief that he has something more to contribute.\n\nThats been inspiring to me. If you look statistically, theyre at the top of the game. Theyre still some of the biggest contributors in the national side, and thats really given me that hope and belief that I can do this, he said.\n\nAnd its also about me just adding real service to the group. Its not an egotistical individual coming back trying to steal any headlines or anything like that. Ive been humbled properly. I look forward to really just adding value, which I probably didnt do to the best of my ability when I was there before.\n\nUltimately, its the feeling of having unfinished business that is calling Taylor back to playing. I wish I had offered a bit more to Zimbabwe cricket. Ive apologised and moved forward from that and I want to work with them.\n\nTaylor is also motivated by the idea of the home World Cup, especially as Zimbabwe have missed out on the last two ODI showpieces and he considers the 2015 tournament, where he was the fourth-highest run-scorer, the peak of his career.\n\nHaving a home World Cup is quite special and weve had some heartache over these last few World Cups so hopefully we can turn that around, he said.\n\nThe balance in our group is, I think, the best it has ever been and theres a huge drive from Zimbabwe Cricket to get this right and get things in place. For Givemore, this World Cup means the whole world to him. He just wants to get this right and put on a good show and I want to be reciprocal in that.\n\n",

While the government subsequently added a local currency component to their earnings, this has proved inadequate.\n\nIt is unfortunate that we are expected to budget for accommodation, transport, food, and other basic necessities from this amount, AUT stated.\n\nIt is clear that our situation is untenable. In as much as we want to continue providing our services, it has now proven practically impossible to do so due to diminished capacity.\n\nAUT further expressed dismay at reports that the UZ management had been spoiling itself with luxurious top-of-the-range vehicles and generous allowance packages at a time when its employees were struggling to make ends meet.\n\nIt has been noted with concern that, even as we struggled to do the bare minimum, the university management shamelessly awarded themselves lavish packages, including expensive cars for senior staff and hefty payouts in the order of thousands of United States dollars, the union further stated.\n\nAdding to the lecturers concerns is the university administrations failure to provide them with the necessary resources for the implementation of the new Education 5.0 curriculum.\n\nThis, the lecturers claim, effectively requires them to purchase essential equipment, such as computers and data for communication and connectivity, from their own pockets.\n\nThe universitys effort to migrate to Education 5.0 has been, to a large extent, at our expense as lecturers, the statement read.\n\nFrom our salaries, we are having to pay for data to facilitate communication with students and coordination amongst ourselves in various university committees, allowing university business to move forward. We are not provided with the necessary tools.\n\nThis would mean the university expects the lecturers, from their very small pay, to buy the requisite electronic gadgets for use in lecture rooms and offices.\n\nThe University of Zimbabwe lecturers notification of industrial action over poor pay is not an isolated incident.\n\nHealthcare workers, including nurses, have recently embarked on protests demanding a review of their salaries.\n\nThe Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union (ARTUZ) is also calling for a nationwide strike from March 28, 2025, citing similar concerns over inadequate pay.\n\nThis impending unrest comes amidst calls for a national shutdown on March 31, 2025, by expelled Zanu PF Central Committee member and war veteran Blessed Geza, who is demanding President Emmerson Mnangagwas resignation, citing a failure to address corruption, nepotism, and tribalism, among other ills.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nGOVERNMENTS urban densification programme in Harare has opened avenues for the invasion of protected areas such as greenways and wetlands by politically connected land barons.\n\nThe land sharks are wreaking havoc in Harare, jostling for greenways and wetlands, and parcelling out stands to potential homeowners.\n\nGreenways and wetlands in Mabelreign are being sold to home seekers by land barons under the guise of the densification programme.\n\nThe programme was launched by the then Minister of Local Government and Public Works, Winston Chitando, under the Local Development Plan Number 20 in October 2023.\n\nThe move was meant to address the huge demand for land in the capital.\n\nHarare residents who spoke to NewZimbabwe.com raised concerns over the programme, which has opened a conduit for land corruption.\n\nJaweet Maponga, who has been a Mabelreign resident for more than 22 years, was shocked when he witnessed a greenway behind his household being cordoned off.\n\nWe were shocked when we woke up one day to find the other end closed. We were given an ultimatum to harvest what we had planted (maize and vegetables) as the place had become a residential area, said Maponga.\n\nMidnight Land Grab Operations\n\nAccording to the City of Harare (CoH) plan, the greenways were established to serve as playgrounds and other recreational facilities for nearby residents.\n\nUnder the Local Development Plan Number 20, the greenways have been converted into residential stands to ease the demand for land.\n\nHowever, the allocation of land is being done clandestinely, with land barons working with some CoH officials to parcel out land without following due process.\n\nRecently, a female police officer came here boasting that she had acquired the land, saying she had been allocated it by council. They all claim that the process has been regularised, hence their claims to have bought the land, Maponga told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nSanitation Concerns\n\nThe allocation of residential stands is in serious violation of council laws on sanitation, posing a health threat to members of the Mabelreign community.\n\nThe Ministry of Local Governments proclamation of the densification programme is silent on the sanitation and hygiene systems of residential areas being built on greenways.\n\nNewZimbabwe.com established that some of the houses being constructed do not have proper sewer systems, with the majority resorting to septic tanks that are closer to water sources.\n\nAnother resident, Innocent Chidaguro, said the establishment of septic tanks near water sources is contaminating underground water.\n\nThere is no proper sewer system in these houses. Pit latrines and septic tanks are in the majority of the houses, which is a danger to us as they are close to our boreholes, said Chidaguro.\n\nPolitical Shadows\n\nThe shadow of the ruling party, Zanu PF, looms over the allocation of infills in Mabelreign.\n\nLand barons linked to Zanu PF have been identified as the leaders in the distribution of land, creating tension with Ward 16 Independent Councillor Denford Ngadziore.\n\nLocal members of Zanu PF have been seen brandishing party regalia as their trump card in the takeover of land.\n\nSome land barons took advantage of the Mabelreign local plan and went on to invade land, building illegal structures. In terms of those who have been building overnight, we have been chasing them away.\n\nOne thing I know for a fact is that most of these land barons are politically connected. They use their political muscle to intimidate residents, said Ngadziore.\n\nCity Councils Defensive Mode\n\nWhile Ngadziore exonerated himself from the scramble for stands, Harare council officials remain entangled in the saga.\n\nCoH Director of Housing, Edmore Nhekairo, is accused of rubber-stamping the invasions of greenways.\n\nNhekairo allegedly approves housing projects in greenways, disregarding the lack of water and sewage reticulation systems.\n\nHCC officials are at the center of corrupt land dealings, as recently revealed by a Commission of Inquiry probing the operations of Town House.\n\nHarare Mayor Jacob Mafume, while denying his councils involvement, said the solution to land barons is for the government to impose a moratorium on the demolition of houses constructed illegally.\n\nAnyone who links my name must stop forthwith. I am not linked to any land grab or any nefarious activities. I have not authorised anyone, nor will I authorise anyone, said Mafume.\n\nCoH is losing millions of dollars in land revenue to land barons who line their pockets from the illegal sale of stands.\n\nWhile Mafume and the central government are at odds on policy, greenways are slipping into the hands of land barons, who have taken advantage of the situation to distribute land, prejudicing the council and government.Just like the majority Ward 16, residents are caught between a rock and a hard place as land grabs continue unabated.\n\nWe have tried everything, but we are not getting the green light from the councillor. When we ask him, he tells us that the matter is done and dusted, so we do not know what to do, said Maponga.\n\n",

            "content": "By BBC\n\nPOPE Francis will be discharged from Romes Gemelli hospital this Sunday and will need at least two months of rest at the Vatican, doctors treating him have said.\n\nThe 88-year-old was admitted to the hospital on 14 February with a severe respiratory infection that resulted in double pneumonia.\n\nDuring the past five weeks, he presented two very critical episodes where his life was in danger, Dr Sergio Alfieri, one of the doctors treating the Pope, said.\n\nPope Francis was never intubated and always remained alert and oriented, Dr Alfieri said.\n\nThe Pope is not completely healed, but no longer has pneumonia and is now in a stable condition, according to his doctors.\n\nToday we are happy to say that tomorrow he will be at home, Dr Alfieri told reporters on Saturday.\n\nThe Pope will offer a blessing from his window at the Gemelli hospital on Sunday  the first time he will appear in public since he was admitted to hospital  before returning to his residence at the Vatican.\n\nDr Alfieri said that patients with double pneumonia lose their voice a little and especially in the elderly, it will take time for your voice to return to normal.\n\nOn Friday, Cardinal Victor Fernandez had said high-flow oxygen dries everything out and as a result the Pope needs to relearn how to speak, Reuters had reported.\n\nIf the trend of improvement continues, doctors said, the Pope would be able to return to work as soon as possible.\n\nThe Vatican had said on Friday that the Pope had seen some improvements in his breathing and mobility.\n\nIt had confirmed he no longer uses mechanical ventilation for breathing at night, but was instead receiving oxygen via a small tube under his nose. During the day, he is using less high-flow oxygen.\n\nThe Pope has only been seen by the public once since he was admitted to hospital, in a photograph released by the Vatican last week, which showed him praying in a hospital chapel.\n\nEarlier this month, an audio recording of Pope Francis speaking in his native Spanish was played in St Peters Square in Vatican City.\n\nHis voice was breathless as he thanked the Catholic faithful for their prayers.\n\nPope Francis has spent nearly 12 years as leader of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nHe has suffered a number of health issues throughout his life, including having part of one of his lungs removed at age 21, making him more prone to infections.\n\n",
