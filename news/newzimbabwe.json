The minister described the living conditions as deplorable for the nations protectors.Kazembe painted a grim picture of the housing situation, urging immediate budgetary intervention to address the welfare of the police force. He argued that the current state of affairs is unacceptable for those tasked with upholding law and order.During his address, Kazembe did not mince his words in his assessment of the police living quarters. He expressed deep concern over the measures officers are forced to take to have a roof over their heads.The welfare of police officers must be prioritised. It is deplorable that our officers, who serve and protect the nation, are living in conditions where they are sharing accommodation and dividing rooms with curtains. This is not befitting of their status.The use of curtains as room dividers for multiple families points to an extreme lack of privacy and basic living standards.The crux of Kazembes presentation was a call for a transformative budget. He directly linked the poor living conditions to broader issues within the police force, suggesting that better housing is key to professional conduct.Decent living conditions are key to enhancing morale, discipline, and professionalism within the force. We must change the narrative and restore the dignity of our officers through increased budgetary support for the construction of adequate and modern housing units.\n\nHome Affairs Minister Kazembe Kazembe made the shocking revelation during a pre-budget seminar in Bulawayo last week.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nOPPOSITION Member of Parliament Charlton Hwende has made a bold demand for substantial housing loans for legislators, stating that the US$40,000 provided in the past is not enough.\n\nThe Kuwadzana constituency legislator has called for government to budget a minimum of US$150,000 for each lawmaker to acquire a home.Hwende tabled the request during a pre-budget seminar in Bulawayo last week, arguing that the previous loan amount was inadequate, especially when compared to the benefits received by members of the Executive.He also used the platform to criticise the Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube for failing to hike parliamentary salaries.Contributing to the debate on the national budget, Hwende directly addressed the issue of legislator welfare. He lamented the governments failure to provide funds for MPs to build on residential stands they had been allocated. The MP framed his request not as a luxury, but as a necessary provision for those serving the public.We received housing loans worth US$40,000 (approx. R720,000), but because of inflation and compared to what those in the Executive received, we also want you to budget a minimum of US$150,000 (approx. R2.7 million) as a loan that will ensure an MP gets a house, Hwende said.This is not the first time the difficult conditions faced by MPs have been raised. Just weeks earlier, in October 2025, the National Assembly saw heated exchanges over the same topic. Another opposition legislator, Dzivaresekwa MP Edwin Mushoriwa spoke emotionally, declaring that MPs were struggling for survival.Mushoriwa linked the death of Nkulumane MP Desire Moyo to Parliaments failure to support its members. Moyo died in a car accident on October 10, 2025, after his vehicle collided with an elephant. Mushoriwa claimed the fatal crash occurred after Moyo had delayed his trip waiting for overdue fuel coupons.One of the reasons why Hon. Moyo and others were involved in an accident is that they received their coupons around 8:00 pm in this Parliament. If Members of Parliament are not respected and if this august House is not given the honour that it deserves, if we have a situation where we pass the budget but we are treated as if we are third-class citizens in this country, it just does not work, Madam Speaker.The October session revealed that legislators had gone for months without receiving their fuel allocations. Mushoriwa emphasised that this was not merely an inconvenience but a genuine danger that impaired their ability to serve their constituencies. He stated that without proper support, MPs are left exposed and stripped of dignity.Acting Speaker Tsitsi Gezi repeatedly attempted to steer the discussion towards a future caucus meeting, but Mushoriwa insisted the matter was too urgent to delay.

            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo l IOL\n\nAFRIFORUM CEO Kallie Kriel says his organisation is being unfairly blamed for the diplomatic fallout between South Africa and the United States.\n\nKriel has denied that his organisation is responsible for the deterioration in relations between the United States and South Africa, saying the civil-rights group is being used as a scapegoat amid increasingly public exchanges.IOL reported on Saturday that US President Donald Trump announced a total boycott of the G20 Summit taking place in South Africa later this month. The move and subsequent comments from US politicians have put AfriForum at the eye of the diplomatic storm.Kriel: We never used that terminologySpeaking to broadcaster Newzroom Afrika on Saturday, Kriel insisted AfriForum had never described the situation in South Africa as a genocide targeting Afrikaners.That is another lie spread by the ANC. The fact is, those media institutions that accused us of spreading the white genocide narrative, we took them to the Press Ombud and already five of those institutions had to apologise to us. We never used that terminology.Our stance is quite clear, the Kill the Boer, Kill the farmer chant, calling for the killing of Afrikaners on an ethnic basis, is a genocidal call. But we never said there is genocide. All we are asking from the government and the president is  condemn this call, acknowledge the fact that we are seeing tortures that accompany these murders, and declare it a priority crime, he said.Kriel said when his organisation visited the United States, AfriForum understood the consequences of concerns which had been raised repeatedly in Washington about the situation in South Africa.We knew exactly what the consequences would be if those issues were not addressed. That is why we went to the US after that post (by Trump) and made a plea to the US administration not to punish the country for the irresponsible behaviour of the ANC. The fact is, and people are falling for this, they dont want to take responsibility for the consequences of their own negative behaviour. They now need a scapegoat, he said.If you go and have a look, long before we went to the US, in the House of Representatives, a Bill was asking for the review of the relationship with South Africa. The stuff mentioned there was former minister Naledi Pandor visiting Iran and a number of other issues. We did not go to Iran, we did not sign the Expropriation Act, we are not the ones refusing to condemn the kill the Boerchant.It is the irresponsible behaviour of ANC leaders.Kriel said the denialism by the ANC has failed and everyone is now reaping the bitter fruits.Political fallout grows ahead of G20The political dispute between Pretoria and Washington has taken on a diplomatic dimension after public comments by US political figures and the decision by Washington to withhold official representation at the G20.Observers say the episode has amplified domestic polarisation, with civil-society groups, opposition parties and government figures trading accusations about motives and responsibility.Earlier on Saturday, IOL reported that South Africas International Relations and Cooperation Minister Ronald Lamola has publicly challenged claims by US Secretary of State Marco Rubio that Afrikaners are being racially persecuted, describing the allegations as politically motivated and unsupported by formal data.The exchange on social media platform X (formerly Twitter) comes in the wake of Trumps announcement that no American officials would attend next weeks G20 summit in South Africa. IOL reported on Saturday that Trump insisted that his administration would not send officials to the G20 in Joburg.Trump claimed that Afrikaners are being slaughtered, accusing Pretoria of turning a blind eye to violence against white farmers. His remarks drew sharp criticism from South African officials and analysts, who dismissed them as inflammatory and inaccurate.\n\nKriel has denied that his organisation is responsible for the deterioration in relations between the United States and South Africa, saying the civil-rights group is being used as a scapegoat amid increasingly public exchanges.\n\nIOL reported on Saturday that US President Donald Trump announced a total boycott of the G20 Summit taking place in South Africa later this month.
