            "content": "When it comes to e-sports, where the stakes are great and the competition is fierce, emotional intelligence (EI) is essential. Emotionally intelligent teams are known for being tough, communicating eloquently, and having strong team dynamics, all of which are important for winning competitive games. When integrated well, EI helps these efforts and turns possible losses into chances to win. For a more profound understanding of how emotional intelligence can shape successful esports teams,Avia Mastersoffers further insights.\n\nUnderstanding EI in Esports\n\nIn e-sports, emotional intelligence (EI) is a key factor that affects how teams communicate and work together. Teams with higher emotional intelligence understand and care about each other more, which makes working together much easier. This knowledge helps the team work together better and communicate more clearly.\n\nEI is also essential to managing disagreements within teams. Being aware of and controlling individual and team emotions can prevent arguments from worsening. This helps the team stay focused and work together and strengthens them overall, so they can handle the pressure of competitive play and adapt to constantly changing conditions.\n\nWhen there is a lot of pressure to do well in e-sports, teams that can talk to each other and work out their differences are more likely to win. Emotional intelligence helps people on a team say what they want to say, listen carefully, and reply to each other with understanding and empathy.\n\nBuilding Trust Through EI\n\nWhen people on an e-sports team feel understood and respected, they are much more likely to trust each other. This is called emotional intelligence (EI). EI leaders are good at recognising and controlling their emotions as well as understanding and reacting to the emotions of the people on their team. Being able to do this makes you more empathetic, which is important for making strong, trusting connections.\n\nGood conversation is key to emotional intelligence and building trust. Leaders and team members can avoid misunderstandings and ensure that everyones voice is heard and valued by listening carefully and responding with care. In addition, EI helps team members handle disagreements in a healthy way by focussing on solutions instead of blaming each other.\n\nTraining and Development\n\nEsports teams can improve their emotional intelligence by using various training programmes meant to boost teamwork and success. Workshops and classes that cover important EI skills, like self-awareness, empathy, and interpersonal communication skills, are common parts of effective EI training. During these meetings, team members usually learn about EI in a theoretical way and then apply what theyve learned to practical situations.\n\nFurthermore, role-playing and simulation games are helpful because they let team members practise controlling their emotions and reacting with empathy in different situations. Mindfulness and stress management training can also be added to help team members better control their emotions and stay strong.\n\nPhoto byAxvilleonUnsplash\n\nPsychological Aspects and Winning Mindset\n\nEmotional intelligence (EI) greatly affects the mental and emotional skills needed to perform at your best in e-sports.\n\nHere are some key benefits of EI in developing a winning mindset and enhancing team resilience:\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/why-is-zimbabwes-president-mnangagwa-facing-pressure-to-resign/",
            "content": "Al Jazeera\n\nZimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa is facing what experts say is the biggest threat to his rule yet as a succession battle erupts ahead of general elections scheduled for 2028.\n\nRecent manoeuvrings by the president and his supporters to extend his rule to 2030 have led to calls andprotestsfrom within his party for the president to step down or be forced to do so. The upheavals have seen the dismissal of top security officials, a move experts say Mnangagwa is taking to avoid being overthrown in a coup.\n\nThe president has long faced criticism from Zimbabweans, but dissent within his ZANU-PF party is rare, and public calls for demonstrations against him are unprecedented. On Monday, demonstrators took to the streets in protests called by a top ZANU-PF member.\n\nZimbabwe has for decades been mired in political crises that have led toeconomic stagnation, a dearth of jobs, and general government dysfunction. Hyperinflation over the past two decades has pushed the South African countrys economy to its knees and wiped out the savings of common people.\n\nZimbabweans are tired and need a messiah, Blessing Vava, director of human rights group Crisis Zimbabwe, told Al Jazeera.\n\nHeres what to know about the latest crisis:\n\nAn internal split within the ruling ZANU-PF party, which has held power since Zimbabwes independence in 1980, is driving the current crisis.\n\nTwo main factions are at loggerheads, one supporting a prolonged term for Mnangagwa, 82, and another one supporting the ascendancy of Constantino Chiwenga, his 68-year-old vice president.\n\nMnangagwa came to power in 2017 amid promises of democratic and economic reforms. However, critics say corruption levels have remained high, the opposition has beentargeted, and the economy has continued to slide.\n\nZimbabwes constitution has a two-term limit for presidents. Mnangagwa is currently in his second elected term, which ends in 2028 when elections are due.\n\nHowever, some members of the ZANU-PF party have been chanting a 2030 agenda since last year, saying the president should stay in power for a third term to continue his reforms, although that would violate the constitution.\n\nAt a conference in December, the party officially adopted a motion to extend Mnangagwas rule till 2030. Thats subject to the approval of the Senate and a national referendum, but the motion has prompted nationwide debate and controversy.\n\nWithin ZANU-PF, a dissenting faction led by Blessed Bombshell Geza, a liberation war veteran and senior party member, has since held conferences to speak out against Mnangagwa. He has accused the government of being corrupt and called on people to protest. In one video published on social media, he regretted supporting the presidents rise to power.\n\nAs soon as he [Mnangagwa] had the taste of power, he escalated corruption, forgot the people, and only remembered his family, Geza said. The politician said Mnangagwa would be forced out and accused him of surrendering power to his wife and kids, who he said are powerful behind-the-scene actors in the presidents third term bid.\n\nFirst Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa, alongside her husband and several other government officials,were sanctioned by the United Statesin March 2024 for alleged involvement in illicit diamond and gold networks. In 2023, an Al Jazeera investigation revealed that Zimbabwean officials were usingsmuggling gangsto sell the countrys gold to soften the impact of sanctions.\n\nHowever, Gezas critics point out that he, too, is part of the establishment that has long controlled Zimbabwe. Analyst Takura Zhangazha told Al Jazeera that Gezas opposition is gaining broader traction only because it comes at a time when the countrys national economy is also struggling  which Zimbabweans blame on the ruling government. Any support that Gezas calls for Mnangagwa to resign gets is not because people believe he will fight for them, he added.\n\nMr Geza is representative of [the government] in the public eye, Zhangazha said. So he does not have an organic or popular authenticity.\n\nZANU-PF officials, as well as Mnangagwa, have called Gezas taunts treasonous. The politician, who has now reportedly gone into hiding, was ousted from the party on March 7. He is wanted by the police on several charges, including undermining the authority of the president and for allegedly inciting public violence.\n\nMeanwhile, Mnangagwa has shuffled the countrys national security leadership. General Anselem Sanyatwe, commander of the presidential guard, was fired last week. Earlier, Godwin Matanga, chief of police, and Isaac Moyo, head of the intelligence service, were dismissed.\n\nGeza had, in recent weeks, called for mass demonstrations this week against President Mnangagwa. By Friday, security officials had poured onto the streets, conducting stop-and-search on vehicles in the capital, Harare.\n\nOn Monday, some demonstrators gathered at the citys Robert Mugabe Square, even as social media videos showed armoured tanks rolling down the streets as security was beefed up.\n\nMost people, however, chose to stay at home to avoid potential violence. Businesses and offices were completely shut down across the country, as a result, although authorities had urged people to go to work. Vava, of Crisis Zimbabwe, said many Zimbabweans are fed up with ZANU PFs power struggles, but that they had protested in their way.\n\nZimbabweans feel cheated, and they dont want to be used again, Vava said. But the shutdown was also a success. By choosing to stay at home, what we saw was also Zimbabweans demonstrating, saying that we dont want to be dragged into your internal battles.\n\nMeanwhile, those who gathered were forcefully dispersed with tear gas. Police also arrested dozens of others. On Tuesday, officials said they had arrested 95 protesters on charges of public violence and breaches of peace. Officials said some people were arrested at the site of the demonstrations, while others were picked up because of their social media posts.\n\nState-owned newspapers, such as the Zimbabwe Herald, reported that the protests were a failure. Reacting to the low numbers, government spokesperson Farai Muroiwa Marapira said in a post on X that the demonstrators were put to shame.\n\nTo many, the current crisis is reminiscent of the fall of the lateRobert Mugabe, who held onto power for 37 years before being deposed in a coup in 2017.\n\nMugabe, who was forced out at the age of 93, led the countrys fight for independence. However, his subsequent rule was characterised by the repression of opposition members, election rigging, corruption and economic stagnancy. He refused to give up the presidency for decades.\n\nMnangagwa was a longtime ally of Mugabe and served as defence minister and then vice president in the final years of Mugabes rule. He had close ties to the military.\n\nHowever, the two men fell out over who would succeed Mugabe: Mnangwaga was backed by the army on the one hand, while Mugabe wanted to hand over to his wife Grace Mugabe on the other.\n\nOn November 6, 2017, Mugabe dismissed Mnangagwa, triggering the beginning of his downfall. A week later, the armed forcesseized control, and Mnangagwa took power.\n\nNow, the president, too, appears caught in the same spiral. Although he had once promised to hand over power to Vice President Chiwenga, who was a major player in the Mugabe coup, Mnangagwa has since changed his tune, analysts say.\n\nChiwenga, who Geza claims to be speaking for, has not publicly stated his desire to run for president or spoken out against Mnangagwa.\n\nMnangagwa is unlikely to be successful in prolonging his rule because of a citizenry fed up with political machinations and because of the deep internal splits in ZANU-PF, Vava told Al Jazeera.\n\nPeople dont want the 2030 agenda, he said. It will be a battle for survival for Mnangagwa.\n\n",

In doing so, he abandoned his constitutional duty to uphold the constitution and gravely betrayed the trust of the Korean people, Moon said.\n\nSuch unlawful and unconstitutional conduct constitutes an act that cannot be tolerated under the constitution, the justice continued.\n\nThe negative consequences and ripple effects of these actions are substantial, and the benefit of restoring constitutional order through removal from office outweighs the national costs associated with the dismissal of a sitting president, he said.\n\nThe opposition Democratic Party described the verdict as a peoples victory, while Yoons ruling People Power Party said it humbly accepts the courts ruling, according to South Korean official Yonhap News Agency.\n\nYoon claimed at the time that anti-state and North Korean forces had infiltrated the government, butsenior military and police officials who were sent to shut down the countrys National Assembly have testified that he ordered them to detain rival politicians and prevent the assembly from voting to lift his military rule order.\n\n",
