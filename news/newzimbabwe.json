Does SZA think shes more successful than me? Lol yall catch me up pls. SZA, if every song youve ever done vanished right now, the music business wouldnt even miss you.\n\nIn this lengthy tweet, the Trinidadian-born rapper went on to claim that other countries that she has been to have no clue who SZA is and the singer has not even headlined a concert that consists of 80 000 attendees.\n\nShe added: Boo, Im an icon. Youre not.\n\nWhile you would think that it was the end, you are wrong because Minaj followed up with a series of tweets calling SZA a weirdo after Minajs fanbase shared screenshots of SZA bashing other women in the music industry, including Rihanna, Beyonce and even the rapper herself.\n\nLike do you know the level of inside HATE for yourself you had to have had to be this much of a cunt for no reason to the women you later worked with? Now you wanna act like a mthfckn tarot card, b***t quit. What an odd little weirdo, she wrote.\n\nWhile Nicki did not stop there, SZA, on the other hand, subtly replied to Minajs rants by wishing everyone a blessed night.\n\nLmao lemme go back to being calm, shy and meek. Yall have a blessed night! See you tomorrow for night 2 Paris!!\n\nSZA is not the only artist who has experienced the wrath of Minajs X rants.\n\nJust last week, Minaj sparked a feud with the Carters, as she claimed that Jay Z cheated her out of a multi-million dollar deal with streaming service, TIDAL.\n\nWhile on her infamous rants, Beyoncs fanbase, Beyhive, quickly defended their idol, who is currently on tour.\n\nCardi Bis also known to be one of the people that has beef with Minaj. Even though their feud dates back to 2018, to date, the rappers continue to throw jabs at each other on social media.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nPermanant Secretary in the Ministry of Health and Child Care Dr Aspect Maunganidze says the United States withdrawal of funding for Zimbabwes healthcare sector, coupled with general donor fatigue, has disrupted the countrys HIV financing and programming.\n\nThe Trump administration withdrew funding by at least 85% worldwide earlier this year, severely affecting several poor countries, including Zimbabwe.\n\nGiving oral evidence to the Joint Portfolio Committee on Health and Child Care and the Thematic Committee on HIV and AIDS on HIV financing this Tuesday, Maunganidze said the reduced financing due to donor withdrawal had forced the ministry to re-strategise its funding mechanisms.\n\nHe told the committees that the ministry had written to Treasury seeking a supplementary budget to close the funding gap created by the US withdrawal and donor fatigue, in order to strengthen the national HIV response.\n\nThe main challenges in HIV and AIDS funding have always included some funding gaps, regardless of donor support or otherwise. Even ensuring that our strategic plan is truly a national HIV strategic plan that is sustainable, particularly in HIV prevention and related initiatives, has been difficult.\n\nHowever, the major threat right now is the withdrawal of donor funding.\n\nWhat we have observed globally is a general fatigue in donor funding. Whether it comes through the UN, the Global Fund, or other partners, this fatigue is concerning. There are now many competing global health and humanitarian challenges that have emerged in recent years, not just HIV and AIDS.\n\nThis has unfortunately been compounded by the abrupt withdrawal of funding from one of our key donorsthe US government, Maunganidze said.\n\nHe explained that the US had been supporting HIV funding through PEPFAR (Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) and by contributing significantly to the Global Fund.\n\nThe US government contributes 30% of the Global Fund, which supports HIV, TB, and malaria interventions.\n\nThrough PEPFAR and US implementing agencies like the CDC and the Presidents Malaria Initiative, this sudden funding withdrawal has had significant consequences for our healthcare services, he said.\n\nMaunganidze also outlined Zimbabwes domestic and international HIV financing models.\n\nDomestically, we rely on the national budget allocation and the Health Levy (a 5% tax on mobile data and airtime), which supports various programs, including HIV.\n\nWeve also introduced specific taxes through the main budgetlike the recently implemented Health Sugar Levyto help strengthen our HIV response, he said.\n\nOn the international front, Maunganidzecited continued support from the Global Fund, the Health Development Fund, and donors such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nHe added that the ministry also works with the United Nations and follows UNAIDS Fast-Track commitments for 2020 and 2026, which aim to strengthen HIV responses in the country.\n\nIn general, partners contribute between 50% and 65% of funding for our HIV response.\n\nWhen looking at the overall health budget, development partners have contributed between 35% and 45%, and in some years, even beyond 50%, he noted.\n\nFollowing the US funding withdrawal announced on January 20, 2025, the government responded by announcing on May 15, 2025, intensified efforts to mobilise more domestic resources and laid out a roadmap to strategically boost local HIV drug production.\n\nI must say we are okay on HIV funding until at least January 20, 2026. The same applies to TB and malaria medicines.\n\nHowever, we must continue ensuring that our local revenue streams support a sustained HIV response so that we maintain our gains, particularly on the 95-95-95 UN targets, which we have already achieved.\n\nSince January, over 5,000 HIV-related deaths have been recorded, raising serious concerns about the governments need to increase investment in HIV financing and programming.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nGOVERNMENT has announced that fees at private health institutions will be subject to prescribed maximum limits and percentage increases, unless specifically approved by the Minister responsible for health.\n\nPresenting the Bill during its second reading in the National Assembly on Tuesday, Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Ziyambi Ziyambi said the legislation seeks to align the Medical Services Act with the fundamental principles enshrined in the Constitution.\n\nThis Bill, Mr Speaker Sir, is a testament of our commitment to ensuring that every citizen and permanent resident of our nation has access to essential health services.\n\nThe memorandum accompanying this Bill clearly outlines its primary objective, that is to uphold constitutional rights related to health and these rights are clearly stipulated in the Constitution, said Ziyambi.\n\nA key provision of the Bill, Clause 9, proposes amendments concerning fees and charges at private health institutions.\n\nZiyambi revealed that under the new amendments, no private hospital authority may impose fees exceeding prescribed amounts or increase fees beyond prescribed percentages without the Ministers approval.\n\nSubsection 1 stated that no responsible authority at a private hospital should impose fees above a prescribed amount or increase them by more than a prescribed percentage except with the approval of the Minister, he said.\n\nIt also included a proviso that paragraph A, imposing fees above a prescribed amount, would not apply to fees already being charged immediately before a fixed date.\n\nThe amendment in this Bill repeals this provision. Fees and charges at private health institutions, regardless of when they were first introduced, will be subject to the prescribed maximums and percentage increases unless specifically approved by the Minister. This change ensures greater oversight and control over the cost of private healthcare, aiming to protect patients from exorbitant charges, said Ziyambi further.\n\nThe proposed law will likely impact the operations of private medical facilities, which have assisted in alleviating the burden being suffered by Public facilities.\n\nAs public hospitals are in dire straits, citizens are left at the mercy of private institutions which are better equipped to cater for sick patients.\n\nClause 10 of the bill further empowers the Minister to enact regulations relating to healthcare for children, persons with chronic illnesses, liberation war veterans, and persons with disabilities.\n\nIt also provides for the establishment of healthcare packages at various service levels and the creation of a National Consultative Health Forum to facilitate public consultation.\n\nOther significant provisions include Clause 7, which broadens grounds for non-discrimination in healthcare, aligning with Section 56(3) of the Constitution, thereby reinforcing the Governments commitment to inclusive healthcare for all.\n\nZiyambi said the new Section 12(a), introduced by Clause 8, which prohibits private health institutions from refusing emergency medical treatment is of utmost importance.\n\nPerhaps, Mr. Speaker, one of the most impactful provisions is the new Section 12(a), inserted by Clause 8, which prohibits the refusal of emergency medical treatment by private health institutions, aligning with Section 76, Subsection 3 of the Constitution.\n\nThis mandates private institutions to admit patients suffering from life-threatening conditions for a period of not less than 48 hours for stabilisation, even if they cannot afford treatment. This is a lifeline for many and the Bill also allows for agreements between the Minister and private institutions for cost recovery, he said.\n\n",

Barnard declined to disclose the names of the firms, citing ongoing negotiations.\n\nWe are still finalising the last few agreements that we need to put in place and making sure we have all the necessary and compatible industry conditions for our partner to start construction, Barnard said.\n\nWe are looking at breaking ground in the third quarter, he added.\n\nBarnard noted that the planned completion of the $270 million Sandawana lithium concentrator could align with a rebound in lithium prices.\n\nAlthough spot prices have since plunged by nearly 90% due to oversupply and weaker-than-expected EV demand, Chinese companies continue to invest heavily in Zimbabwes lithium sector to secure feedstock for their domestic refineries.\n\nAccording to data from CRU Group, Zimbabwe accounted for roughly 14% of Chinas lithium imports last year.\n\nAnalysts suggest that the current price slump may not last. Recent production cuts, paired with a rebound in EV sales in China, are expected to tighten the market, with lithium demand potentially outpacing supply by the end of the year.\n\nOur forecast is that lithium prices will recover sometime in the year 2027, right at a point in time when we expect the concentration plant to be in production, Barnard said.\n\nLast month, Zimbabwe,Africas leading lithium producer, announced plans to ban the export of lithium concentrates starting January 2027, as part of a broader strategy to boost local value addition in the mining sector.\n\nFor years, Chinese firms operating in Zimbabwe have exported lithium concentrates to China for refining, bypassing local processing.\n\nAs part of its industrialisation drive, Zimbabwe revealed that two lithium sulphate processing plants are currently under development.\n\nOne is at Bikita Minerals, owned by Chinas Sinomine Resource Group, and the other at Prospect Lithium Zimbabwe, operated by Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt.\n\nInterest in lithium is surging across Africa. Countries like Namibia, Mali, Ghana, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) are ramping up exploration and mining efforts.\n\n",
