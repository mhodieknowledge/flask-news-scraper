            "content": "By Gilbert Nyambabvu\n\nThe recent election of Zimbabwe-born researcher,Dr Alice Mpofu-Coles,as mayor in the south-east of English city of Reading is emblematic of the shifting narrative about Africans in the diaspora as they become high achievers and change makers.\n\nThis was said byDiaspora InsuranceCEO Jeff Madzingo at a reception in Reading last week to celebrate Dr Mpofu-Coles election. She took over as mayor of the Berkshire city in May this year, having served four years as a councillor for Whitley Ward.\n\nThis is a huge achievement, not just for yourself but for us as a people and, more importantly, for our children, said Madzingo whosecompanysupported the hosting of the event.\n\nGone are the days when our children grew up without role models and thought that the barriers are too high for them. Your election is evidence that it can be done.\n\nDiaspora Insurance CEO Jeff Madzingo\n\nMadzingoadded; Honourable mayor, we cant salute you enough for doing this because, over the years, the story has been about negativity and poverty, but we are now changing the narrative to a story of resilience and a story of excellence.\n\nBeing mayor in a foreign country is not a joke but success is not accidental; its a culmination of good habits, hard work, professionalism and time management.\n\nDr Mpofu-Coles recounted what she described as a tough journey since relocating to the United Kingdom in 2002 from Zimbabwe and surviving a five-year battle against breast cancer.\n\nIm overwhelmed, she said before kneeling and clapping her hands in appreciation in the traditional Zimbabwean way.\n\nI arrived in the UK in 2002 and thought I would go back to Zimbabwe and become a member of Parliament for the then MDC (party). We were really passionate about Zimbabwe and campaigned right across the country.\n\nShe added, Its been tough; I had breast cancer or five years, and, in that time, I couldnt do anything, but this city of Reading carried me. It was amazing having people care for you.\n\nDr Mpofu-Coles was described as a poster girl of the idea that if I make it, Ill always turn back to pull my sister out too; I wouldnt just walk away.\n\nA former diplomat who served in Zimbabwes foreign service with postings in Mozambique and the former Yugoslavia Dr Mpofu-Coles brings a remarkable personal journey to her mayoral role.\n\nAfter arriving in Reading in 2002 as a refugee she had to rebuild her life in the UK, working hard in a sandwich factory, as a cleaner, a carer for the elderly and disabled, then qualified as social worker, before studying for a doctorate in Human Geography at the University of Reading and building a career in academia.\n\nHaving been supported by Reading Refugee Support Group herself, she became the Chair of the charity and has dedicated her time to advocate for refugees now as a trustee of City of Sanctuary.\n\nAs a Reading councillor, Dr Mpofu-Coles has chaired the Adult Social Care, Childrens Services and Education Committee, and sits on the Parenting Panel, Health and Wellbeing Board and Safer Reading Neighbourhood Forum, among others.\n\nA strong advocate or refugees and fighter against inequalities and poverty, Dr Mpofu-Coles chosen charities for her mayoral year are ReadiFood, a local foodbank service, and Utulivu Womens group, which supports equal opportunities for BAME and refugee women and girls.\n\n",

It marked only the 12th time the currency has strengthened against the dollar in 2025, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe boost comes as gold production rose nearly 46% in the first half of the year to 20,104 kilograms, according to Fidelity Refineries, the countrys sole gold refinery. June alone saw a 63% year-on-year surge in output.This increase in bullion output has helped triple Zimbabwes foreign reserves, offering a much-needed buffer for the countrys fledgling currency and economy, the central bank said.The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe last month reported that it now holds 3.4 tons of gold in its reserves, more than double the 1.5 tons it had in storage when the ZiG currency was first introduced in April last year.Last month, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) expressed support for the ZiG, stating that it hopes to see the currency evolve into Zimbabwes sole legal tender under a potential staff-monitored program.The currency is Zimbabwes sixth attempt in 15 years to establish a stable local currency, and it is backed by 2.5 tons of gold and $100 million in foreign currency reserves held by the central bank.However, despite its gold backing, the ZiG has struggled to win the publics trust.About 80% of transactions in the country are still conducted in U.S. dollars, with some also made in South African rand.\n\nThe boost comes as gold production rose nearly 46% in the first half of the year to 20,104 kilograms, according to Fidelity Refineries, the countrys sole gold refinery.

The mining and quarrying sector showed the highest growth rate of 12,9%, contributing 14,3% to the economy. The wholesale and retail trade sector came in third, contributing 11,8% following a 2,6% growth rate.The modest growth in GDP came amid ongoing efforts by the government to stabilise the macroeconomic environment, support value-added industries, and improve export competitiveness.However, the impact of climate change on agriculture and challenges in infrastructure and energy supply continued to pose risks to sustained growth.According to a report issued by the World Bank in April 2025, Zimbabwes decline in economic growth in 2024 was primarily driven by the El Nio-induced drought.The drought led to steep decline in agricultural output and rising food prices, while hydroelectric power shortages constrained manufacturing. A recovery of 6% growth is expected in 2025, driven by agricultural recovery, investments in mining and steel production, and moderated inflation, the report read.The African Development Bank stated in its Country Focus Report (2 July 2025) that poverty remained widespread in Zimbabwe, with an estimated 57% of the population living below the poverty line in 2024.
