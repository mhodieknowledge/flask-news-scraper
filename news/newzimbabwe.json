This brings the debt-to-GDP ratio to 44% as at 31 March 2025, he said.\n\nIn local currency terms, the countrys stock of Public and Publicly Guaranteed (PPG) debt stood at ZiG576.5 billion as at the end of March 2025. The debt was external debt totalling ZiG337.7 billion, and domestic debt amounting to ZiG238.8 billion, representing 58.6% and 41.4% respectively.\n\nThe external and domestic debt arrears as at end March 2025 amounted to US$7.8 billion, constituting 36% of total PPG debt. The accumulation of arrears since the year 2000 have been worsening the country`s debt situation, constraining access to external concessional financing.\n\nIn this regard, the government is implementing the Arrears Clearance and Debt Resolution Roadmap in order to restore debt sustainability and unlock critical external financing needed for the countrys development programs, he said.\n\nDomestic debt service in local currency totalled ZiG1.64 billion, comprising both principal and interest payments during the period January to June 2025.\n\nDuring the period January to June 2025, Treasury made payments amounting to US$176.28 million for external debt service, which includes US$93.72 million towards the active portfolio, US$79.75 million for legacy debts and US$2.81 million of token payments to the International Financial Institutions and the sixteen Paris Club Bilateral Creditors.\n\nOf this, ZiG39.52 million was paid towards interest payments and ZiG1.60 billion for principal payments related to ZiG-denominated Treasury Bills and bonds.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nDespite the fact that just 35% of the 2025 National Budget allotted funds were spent six months into the year, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube declared a ZWG3.3 billion budget surplus in theMid-Term Budget Review Statement.\n\nPresenting the much-awaited Mid-Term Budget Review Statement, Thursday themed,Building Resilience for Sustained Economic Transformation, the Treasury boss confirmed earlier speculation that much of the allotted resources are rarely disbursed efficiently\n\nFiscal outlays for the period January to June 2025 amounted to ZWG98 billion, which is approximately 35.5% of the approved Budget. Recurrent expenditures were ZWG74.4 billion, while financial and non-financial assets (capital expenditure and net lending) amounted to ZWG23.6 billion, he said.\n\nOf this amount, more than half with ZWG45.4 billion, went towards employment costs and operations ZWG18.8 billion, interest payments paltry at ZWG2.5 billion and capital expenditure, including devolution, amounted to ZWG23.6 billion, leaving very few resources for capital expenditure.\n\nHowever, speaking to the media shortly after the budget presentation, Ncube defended the 35% expenditure to slower drawdowns by Ministries in the first quarter of the year.\n\nMinistries often take time to put their papers in order and we often experience limited revenue inflows during the first parts of the year which partly explains the expenditure patterns. However, we are currently working on improving ways in which expenditures can improve, he said.\n\nNcube said during the years first half, Treasury mobilised resources for budget financing totalling ZWG1.3 billion, including US$90 million Treasury Bills, through the issuance of domestic securities.\n\nIn US dollar terms, the fiscal framework translates to revenues of US$7.5 billion and expenditures of US$7,7 billion, as well as a budget deficit of US$168.4 million.\n\nHe said during the first half of the year 2025, both inflation and exchange rate were relatively stable than envisaged. The budget has, therefore, been performing below target in local currency terms, although performance was significantly above target in foreign currency terms.\n\nRevenue collections during the period amounted to ZWG101.2 billion against a target of ZWG118.1 billion, whilst expenditures were ZiG98 billion against a target of ZWG127.5 billion.\n\nOn a cash accounting basis, a budget surplus of ZWG3.3 billion was recorded during the first six months of the year.\n\nNcube added that drastic reforms aimed at improving the ease of doing business and the eradication of multiple licensing fees would be aggressively implemented in the second half.\n\n",

            "content": "The Varakashi are using anonymous and fake accounts to mock, delegitimise and threaten opposition to the ruling ZANU PF party.\n\nZimbabwes brutal regime, under President Emmerson Mnangagwa, is using social media, particularly X, to smear and silence mostly female anti-government political activists and human rights defenders in the country.\n\nPresident Mnangagwas army of paid pro-government social media trolls is known as theVarakashipropaganda stormtrooperswith some using names of prominent people to open fake X accounts without their knowledge. One ghostX account usesthe name of Zimbabwes former vice president, Joice Mujuru. Even President Mnangagwas spokesperson, George Charambawho is also a senior government employee runs two toxic ghost X accounts@Jamwanda2and@dhonzamusoro007which he uses to attack and post completely fabricated and malicious information about female human rights defenders and political activists in Zimbabwe. The first of these accounts wassuspended in 2022but was reinstated after Elon Musk acquired Twitter and renamed it X.\n\nIn the past year there has been a proliferation of toxic X accounts in the country and they are flourishing. At times, these X accounts incite physical and sexual violence against female political and human rights activists. In one post, a ghost X account threatened a prominent human rights activist that [Im] waiting to rape you. The post drew outrage from X users, and it was later deleted.\n\nAnd in astudy published in 2023, Constance Kasiyamhuru from the University of Johannesburg in South Africa said the Varakashi in Zimbabwe operate mostly on Twitter/X to shut down the political opponents of the governing Zanu PF party.\n\nThrough trolling, name-calling, threats, mocking, mobbing, labelling, ridicule, casting aspersions, delegitimation, disinforming, and other strategies, Varakashi seek to regulate, censure, and discipline anti-musangano[anti-ruling party] online discourse, Kasiyamhuru wrote.\n\nTendai Ruben Mbofana, a Zimbabwe based social justice advocate and writer, said the systematic deployment of online trollsparticularly targeting female human rights defenders and political activistshas become a chilling hallmark of repression in Zimbabwe.\n\nThese smear campaigns are not just personal attacks; they are part of a broader strategy to delegitimise our work, intimidate us into silence, and discredit our credibility in the eyes of the public, Mbofana said.\n\nHe added that the abuse often takes on a deeply misogynistic tone, laced with gendered insults, threats of sexual violence, and false accusations designed to shame and isolate women.\n\nIt creates a climate of fear and forces many women out of digital spaces that should otherwise be used to amplify their voices and advocacy, he said.\n\nSophia Gwasira, who was elected as the first female mayor for Mutare City in eastern Zimbabwe in August 2023, told Index on Censorship that the fear of being smeared and attacked on social media platforms by Zanu PF social media trolls was forcing many women to abandon opposition politics and activism. She said social media platforms were no longer safe places for women in opposition politics in Zimbabwe, with the attackes affecting both them and their families.\n\nIts affecting us not only physically but emotionally too. We are trying to find ways of countering these attacks. But currently we dont have any protection from our own political parties or from the government, Gwasira said.\n\nBut Gwasira said she will continue to fight for the people and, given the opportunity, she would contest the general elections slated for 2028. Gwasira and many other opposition mayors, MPs and councillors were recalled in late 2023 after her party, the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC)was hijackedby President Mnangagwas ruling party Zanu PF through its proxy, Sengezo Tshabangu. This forced the CCC leader Nelson Chamisa toabandon the oppositionparty and he took a sabbatical from party politics in January 2024.\n\nPromise Mkwananzi, spokesperson for opposition party Citizens Coalition for Changewhich is still loyal to former leader Nelson Chamisa told Index on Censorship that as opposition, they have been identifying and exposing some of these social media ghost accounts and to direct their members to counter the toxic narratives on X.\n\nIt must be noted also that these trolls are paid using taxpayers money to denigrate women and bully voices of the alternative on social media, Mkwananzi said.\n\nBut Mkwananzi was quick to add that his party will continue to fight and mobilise people for a better Zimbabwe.\n\nWe are also educating our members to be strong and to remain focused on recruiting mobilising, educating and radicalising the base.\n\nAlthough women are the main target, men critical of the ruling party are also targeted.\n\nIn my own experience, I have faced repeated, coordinated attacks on X, particularly from anonymous accounts believed to be run or supported by high-ranking government officials, including the presidents spokesperson. These attacks are aimed at silencing dissent and discouraging public engagement. But we will not be silenced. If anything, these attacks only reinforce the urgency of our work, said Tendai Ruben Mbofana Mbofana.\n\nWhen President Mnangagwaseized powerthrough a military coup from Zimbabwes long-time dictator, Robert Mugabe in 2017, President Mnangagwa promised sweeping reforms; economic and political reforms, including upholding human rights and rule of law in the country.\n\nHowever, Zimbabwe has become worse under President Mnangagwa than Mugabe; political opponents to Zanu PF have been brutalised,torturedandkilledand corruption is widespread.\n\nA recent reportby Human Rights Watch said authorities in Zimbabwe have continued to restrict civic space and the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly and the human rights, political and economic situation in Zimbabwe continues to deteriorate.\n\nUnder the current constitution, President Mnangagwas term of officehis second and last termends in 2028 but his party is now planning to amend the constitution to keep him in office till 2030. Meanwhile, Mnangagwas Varakashi are flooding social media with messages in support of the extension of his term and touting his achievements so far.\n\n",
