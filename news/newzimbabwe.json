            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nSouth African authorities have started auctioning the property of Marry Mubaiwa, the ex-wife of Vice President Constantino Chiwenga to compensate victims of financial crimes she allegedly committed years ago, an official has announced.\n\nThe property in Pretoria is suspected to be linked to illicit activities.\n\nThe National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe announced the development in a statement on Monday.\n\nIn a gesture against transactional financial crime, the South African High Court had declared Mubaiwas luxury immovable property located at ERF 191 Sterrewag, Extension 3, and two Land Rovers as assets that should be forfeited to the South African state in December 2022.\n\nThese assets had been placed under a preservation order since February 9 2022, due to their alleged connection to proceeds from crimes such as money laundering and illicit financial flows.\n\nThe High Court ordered that the said properties be placed under the custody of an auctioneer, with proceeds of the public sale to be directed towards compensating the victim(s) of the offence.\n\nOne of the forfeited vehicles was recently auctioned with the proceeds set to be transferred to the victim, announced the NPA.\n\nThe NPA also said this case is a landmark demonstration of the strength and efficacy of cross-border legal cooperation within the Southern African Development Community (SADC).\n\nThe outcome reflects the enduring partnership between the NPA of South Africa and its Zimbabwean counterpart in addressing transnational financial crimes and the recovery of proceeds of crime, reads the statement.\n\nDocuments show that South Africas NPA on October 14 2021, received a request for Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) for Zimbabwe against Mubaiwa.\n\nZACC Commissioner Frank Muchengwa told South African authorities the anti-graft body had received information from a whistleblower that Mubaiwa had fraudulently exported funds to South Africa to buy some properties.\n\nIt is alleged that Mubaiwa instructed Memory Chakulinga, her relative and Managing Director of her two companies in SA, Falcon Project Pty and Bonnets Electrical Pty in Pretoria, to raise proforma invoices for the purchase of event tents and chairs and prepaid meters.\n\nMuchengwa said the invoices would then be referred to the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe (CBZ) as if they specifically intended to purchase the goods, but the funds were allegedly diverted to purchase her personal properties.\n\nChakulinga states further that Mubaiwa is her aunt and she recalls Mubaiwa approaching her to assist in setting up a business in South Africa, as she indicated that she had won a tender in Zimbabwe. Chakulinga also allegedly said Mubaiwa had told her that she had the facility to get money from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe for funding the business, Muchengwa said.\n\nChakulinga allegedly offered assistance with a place to open a business at her premises.\n\nShe was then asked to do proforma invoices in the name of Tanor Investment for the supply of event hosting accessories, tents for R203 308 and the invoices had Mubaiwas Falcon Suppliers FNB bank accounts.\n\nCourt papers show that in December 2018, R203,308 was deposited into the account from CBZ and according to the narration, it was intended for the purchase of tents.\n\nAccording to Chakulinga, upon receipt in her account the funds, Mubaiwa instructed her to divert the funds towards purchase of Range Rover at Menlyn in Pretoria, reads court papers.\n\nChakulinga states that she paid R4 million to Range Rover Menlyn and she was told by Mubaiwa that the motor vehicle was to be taken to Zimbabwe but to her surprise, it was registered in South Africa under Marry Mubaiwa.\n\nIn May, according to Chakulinga, another R2 million was deposited into Bonnette Electrical FNB account and she was called by the bank to confirm the receipt of the funds.\n\nShe did what she had been instructed to do before but this time on the invoices indicated she was to buy electrical prepaid meters.\n\nChakulinga added that after the release of the funds, Mubaiwa ordered her to transfer R4 96 500 to the Martin Potgieter Trust Account at Standard Bank.\n\nAccording to Muchengwa, there was a financial flow from CBZ to FNB that was detected on the accounts.\n\nIt was established that one of the signatories at Mubaiwas East Town Commodities was Jeffery Jenje and he allegedly confirmed this.\n\nJenje also confirmed payments that were made and also that Mubaiwa indeed purchased two vehicles.\n\nProof of vehicle purchase was provided by Jacobus Hercules Du Preez.\n\nDu Preez said Mubaiwa bought two vehicles worth R1,6 million and R1,8 million, respectively.\n\nThe ongoing investigations also revealed that Mubaiwa bought a house by sourcing cash from individual companies to purchase on her behalf.\n\n",

            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nZimbabwes best chance of exiting a 25-year debt default is to engage the Group of 20 nations to help formulate a solution and stop trying to work its way out of the quagmire itself, World Bank President Ajay Banga said.\n\nThe southern African country owes the World Bank and other creditors a total of $21 billion and has tried numerous unsuccessful strategies to restore its access to global capital markets. Those ranged from attempting to repay its debts using the proceeds of metal sales and recently approaching 10 nations for help to raise $2.6 billion to pay its arrears.\n\nAjay Banga. Image: Bloomberg\n\nTrying to figure it out on your own, youll be doing this for the next five years, Banga said in an interview in Maputo, Mozambiques capital. They need to figure out a way to reach out to the G20 and say, we raise our hand, wed like to be part of this process.\n\nZimbabwe first defaulted on repayments to the World Bank in 2000. Its debts to a host of multilateral institutions and bilateral lenders mounted amid a failed land-reform program and a quarter century of economic turmoil, shutting it out of international debt markets and limiting its ability to borrow even during the global pandemic and a recent devastating drought.\n\nThe government has asked the African Development Bank to advise on clearing its debt with the institutions outgoing president, Akinwumi Adesina, and former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano asked to negotiate with creditors. It also hired Global Sovereign Advisory, a Paris-based consultancy, to help. The fact that Zimbabwean officials, including President Emmerson Mnangagwa, have been sanctioned by the US has complicated the process.\n\nWhile Belarus, Syria and Eritrea are also in arrears to the World Bank, Zimbabwes default is by far the longest. South Africa, which currently holds the G-20 presidency, last month said it has been approached by Zimbabwe to try and garner the groups support for a debt workout.\n\nZambia, Ghana and Ethiopia are among nations that have employed the G20s Common Framework, which was created in 2020 to help poor nations bring together a diverse set of creditors to restructure debts. While they have made progress in reaching deals, the process has been criticized for being too slow.\n\nZimbabwe isnt technically poor enough to be eligible to utilise the framework, yet Sri Lanka  a nation in a similar situation  approached the group in 2023 for help with dealing with its creditors.\n\nStart talking to the G20 and the Paris Club and whoever else has given them money and we can help, Banga said. We try and bring an understanding of what write down you need to take. It takes a while.\n\nZimbabwes Treasury didnt respond to a request for comment.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nKidnappers in Nigeria have killed at least 35 people they abducted from a village in northern Zamfara state despite ransoms being paid for their release, a local official told the BBC.\n\nIn recent years, criminal gangs in the region, known in the country as bandits, have taken to kidnapping people as a means to raise money.\n\nIn this incident, 56 people were taken from Banga village, Kauran Namoda local government area in March. The gunmen then demanded a ransom of one million naira ($655; 485) per captive, media in Nigeria report.\n\nLocal government chairman Manniru Haidara Kaura said that most of those killed were young people who were slaughtered like rams.\n\nWhat happened was that the bandits demanded ransom money, and after some back-and-forth, they were given what they asked for. They then released 18 people, including 17 women and one young boy, on Saturday, Haidara added.\n\nOnly they [the gunmen] know why they killed them. They are senseless and heartless people. They forget that they are killing their own brothers, and we will all meet before Allah.\n\nSixteen of those released on Saturday are in the hospital receiving treatment, while the bodies of the 38 killed by the bandits are unlikely to be returned as in these cases corpses are rarely released.\n\nIn an attempt to curb the spiralling and lucrative kidnapping industry, a law was enacted in 2022 making it a crime to make ransom payments. It carries a jail sentence of at least 15 years, however no-one has ever been arrested on those charges.\n\nIt also made abduction punishable by death in cases where victims die.\n\nBut families often feel forced to pay to save their loved ones, citing the governments inability to ensure their safety.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nZimbabwean activist Duke Maplanka Atterbell says the South African government is complicit in systemic discrimination against foreign nationals and has failed to act in the face of escalating xenophobic violence and medical exclusion.\n\nIn a formal letter dated 27 July 2025, addressed toPresident Cyril Ramaphosa,Minister of health,Minister of home affairsand theSouth African Human Rights Commission, Atterbell accused the state of both silence and active neglect, warning of formal complaints to African and international human rights bodies if urgent action is not taken.\n\nI write this letter as both a concerned African citizen and a representative voice of thousands of foreign nationals, especially Zimbabweans, living in South Africa, Atterbell said.\n\nHe described a worsening situation where foreign nationals are being chased out of hospitals, clinics, and even maternity wards. Others are beaten in the streets, publicly humiliated, or threatened by vigilantes emboldened by government silence.\n\nHis letter denounced what he calls a double standard in South Africas global human rights stance, referencing Pretorias condemnation of injustice abroad while allegedly turning a blind eye at home.\n\nHow can South Africa claim the mantle of human rights defender abroad, while at home it presides over de facto ethnic cleansing through economic and medical exclusion? This hypocrisy is staggering, he said.\n\nAtterbell warned that if no action is taken, he will escalate the matter by filing complaints with the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Health, the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, and the South African Human Rights Commission.\n\nHe also promised to engage in public advocacy and international media exposure.\n\nThis is not governance, it is abandonment, he wrote. This is not the South Africa that the continent stood behind during the anti-apartheid struggle. This is not Ubuntu.\n\nAtterbells appeal comes amid rising tensions in the country over undocumented migration, especially concerning access to jobs and healthcare.In March 2024, radio personality Jacinta Ngobese-Zumalaunched March and March, a non-governmental organisation that actively campaigns against the employment and public healthcare access of undocumented foreign nationals in South Africa.\n\nWhat began in KwaZulu-Natal has now spread nationally, with March and March volunteers stationed at entrances of hospitals including Addington Hospital, RK Khan Hospital, and various Gateway Clinics across the province. The group screens patients before entry, turning away those unable to produce South African ID documents.\n\nWe operate where the government has failed, the group has said. While critics have labelled it a vigilante operation targeting vulnerable people, the organisation continues to draw strong support from South Africans who believe hospitals are being overrun by foreigners.\n\nResponding to Atterbells letter, Ngobese-Zuma posted on Facebook:He is Zimbabwean and writes to OUR President and not HIS Kshuthi ngampela they believe they are South African Kshuthi we owe them Kshuthi we must intensify our fight because mentally these ppl dont think that we are serious.\n\n(Translated : He is Zimbabwean and writes to OUR President and not HIS Maybe, seriously, they believe they are South African! Maybe we owe them! Maybe we must intensify our fight because mentally these people dont think that we are serious.)\n\nAtterbell was quick to respond addressing Ngobese-Zuma in defiant terms.\n\nWhen Dudula royalty thinks they can intimidate you, he said, in reference to her association with nationalist movements. Jacinta Zinhle MaNgobese Zuma, lets get one thing straight. I am not here to bow before self-appointed foot soldiers of hate.\n\nI am an enigma, not because I hide, but because I refuse to allow you to spread your bitter view of patriotism unchecked. I am a fearless advocate for human rights, not because its easy, but because people like you have made silence a weapon. And yes, I am a hater of bigotry  proudly, loudly, and unapologetically.\n\nHe continued, accusing Ngobese-Zuma of masking fear as nationalism: You walk around with your chest puffed out like youre some gatekeeper of South Africas soul. But what you really are is a loud emblem of fear, disguised as pride. You lead mobs, I lead with conscience. You shout in mobs, I speak in truth. You weaponise suffering, I document it.\n\nAddressing her direct challenge, Atterbell wrote: You asked, Who are you? Let me answer clearly: I am the one your hate cannot reach and your intimidation cannot shake.\n\nI am the storm you didnt see coming, and the voice youll wish you hadnt tried to silence. Because while you scream for borders, I fight for bridges. While you hunt the vulnerable, I summon accountability. And while you wave your flag with fury, I carry the Constitution with fire.\n\nSo no, MaNgobese. I wont be quiet. Not now. Not ever, said Atterbell.\n\nAtterbell, however, insists that the fight is not against South Africa, but for human dignity.\n\nIf your government fails to act, history, and international law, will remember it not for its silence, but for its complicity.\n\n",
