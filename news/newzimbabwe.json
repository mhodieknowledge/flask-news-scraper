Since his arrival, he has featured in every match his new team has played.\n\nHis latest outing came over the weekend when he helped Marinhense advance to the second round of the Taa de Portugal knockout tournament.\n\nIts always difficult to adapt to a new environment, but Im happy with how Im settling in here. My teammates and coaches have welcomed me warmly, Chimedza said.\n\nIve played at least four competitive games so far, and in our last cup match, I was pleased to contribute to the teams progress to the next stage.\n\nChimedza signed for Gil Vicente earlier this year but was unable to feature due to delays in the clearance of his international papers. As a result, he was loaned out to gain game time and experience.\n\nThe former MK Dons player hopes his spell at Marinhense will prepare him for a return to his parent club.\n\nMy focus is on working hard and contributing to Marinhenses success. At the end of the season, my target is to return to Gil Vicente and cement my place in the team, he added.\n\nBorn in Harare, Chimedza moved to England at the age of 14 after being scouted by English League Two side MK Dons, where he developed before moving to Portugal this year.\n\n",

            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo | IOL\n\nThe Democratic Alliance (DA) has strongly criticised President Cyril Ramaphosas remarks praising Zimbabwes land reform programme during his visit to Harare last week.\n\nRamaphosa was in Zimbabwe at the invitation of President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, where he attended the annual Zimbabwe Agricultural Show as guest of honour. Speaking at the event, Ramaphosa congratulated Zimbabwe for reviving its agricultural sector through policy reforms, investment in irrigation, mechanisation, and empowering both large- and small-scale farmers.\n\nOn independence in 1980, the new democratic government of Zimbabwe had to take on the momentous task of dismantling colonial-era patterns of land ownership. Most of the countrys commercially productive land and large-scale farms were owned by whites. The black majority was confined to communal lands and excluded from commercial farming, said Ramaphosa.\n\nIt was therefore essential  for both historical redress and food security, development and economic growth  that the government embarked on ambitious reforms to facilitate the entry of black Zimbabweans into productive agriculture, including support to small-scale farmers.\n\nReacting to Ramaphosas remarks, DA national spokesperson and Member of Parliament Willie Aucamp said the president was wrongfully praising a programme that devastated Zimbabwes economy.\n\nThe DA condemns and rejects this praise by Ramaphosa for a process which left Zimbabwe in tatters, destroying its economy, destroying its foreign relations, and creating famine for its people, Aucamp said.\n\nHe argued that because land was not legally transferred, Zimbabwe was left with crippling financial reparations due to former farmers and landowners.\n\nRamaphosa is attempting to whitewash the disaster in Zimbabwe, to create momentum for the ANCs land expropriation agenda in terms of the Expropriation Act of 2025, Aucamp added.\n\nWhile acknowledging the need for land reform in South Africa, the DA insisted it must be pursued within the bounds of the Constitution and rule of law.\n\nThe DA firmly believes in the need to redress the injustices of the past, particularly through fair and lawful land reform that restores dignity and economic opportunity. However, this redress must occur within the bounds of the Constitution and the rule of law, which Expropriation Without Compensation does not meet, Aucamp said.\n\nHe further stressed that the Government of National Unity does not endorse Zimbabwes land confiscation model.\n\n",

The lack of clarity is creating devastating consequences, they said.\n\nAccording to HSF and CoRMSA, many Zimbabweans on the permit have already lost jobs, struggled to enrol their children for the 2026 school year, and faced difficulties accessing basic healthcare. They argue that these hardships show why the government must act well before the November deadline.\n\nHSF and CoRMSA call on the Minister of Home Affairs to urgently provide clarity on the status of the consultation process, theorganisations insisted.\n\nIf the process cannot be implemented in time, government must extend the ZEP well before the November deadline. Such action is necessary to prevent further hardship and to uphold fairness and the rule of law.\n\nThe ZEP, first introduced in 2009 to regularise the stay of Zimbabweans in South Africa, has faced years of uncertainty.\n\nA June 2023 High Court ruling ordered the Department of Home Affairs to ensure a fair process before terminating the programme, a decision later confirmed by the Constitutional Court.\n\nAs a result, the permit remains valid until late November 2025.\n\nBut with only months left before that deadline, rights groups warn that the clock is ticking and that delay is once again throwing thousands of lives into chaos.\n\n",
