            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nThe Chairperson of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Budget and Finance, Energy Mutodi, has demanded that the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance, George Guvamatanga, be summoned by Parliament to clear his name following allegations of corruption involving alarming sums in dealings with contractors.\n\nMutodi told Parliament on Thursday that Guvamatanga is allegedly demanding kickbacks of between five and ten percent from contractors, with the threat that their payments will not be processed if they fail to comply.\n\nHe added that Guvamatanga has allegedly made millions through corruption and has repeatedly refused to appear before Parliament when called upon to clear his name, all without any consequences.\n\nMutodi said it is high time Guvamatanga is invited to explain himself, as his actions are tarnishing Zimbabwes reputation.\n\nOur Government cannot be tarnished by the actions of corrupt and greedy people who occupy public office. I therefore urge this House to ensure that we call the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Mr. George Guvamatanga to come and appear before this August House and answer charges of corruption, answer charges of asking to be paid a five to ten percent premium by contractors and all payments made by the Treasury.\n\nWe have made several attempts to call George Guvamatanga to appear before this August House and he has deliberately refused with impunity. This cannot continue, Mutodi said.\n\nHe added that Guvamatangas conduct is now deterring contractors who are no longer interested in providing services to the government, because they fear being asked to pay kickbacks.\n\nMutodi further stated that every government employee, including Permanent Secretaries from all ministries, is accountable to the Parliament of Zimbabwe and therefore must be held to account and answer questions.\n\nIn terms of Section 119 (3) of the Constitution of Zimbabwe, all MDAs, including the Ministry of Finance, the Permanent Secretary and all directors in that office are accountable to Parliament. For that reason, these permanent secretaries, the directors and different officials in these ministries are not undertaking their own personal businesses in those offices but they are being delegated by us because it is us who are elected by the people.\n\nActing Speaker of the National Assembly, Naledi Maunganidze, said the Minister of Finance, Professor Mthuli Ncube, will be made to respond to Parliament.\n\nYesterday, Mutodi took to X, accusing Guvamatanga of sending mercenaries to intimidate him and anyone else who raises corruption issues involving his name.\n\nCorruption is rampant in Zimbabwe, with Vice President Constantino Chiwenga describing it as a national security threat.\n\nAccording to figures cited by National Prosecutor General Justice Matanda-Moyo, Zimbabwe is losing a staggering US$2 billion annually due to corruption and illicit financial dealings.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nZimbabwe is grappling with a critical shortage of forensic pathologists, a situation driven by brain drain and a lack of interest among doctors to specialise in the field, Health Minister Douglas Mombeshora told Parliament on Wednesday.\n\nResponding to questions during a Q&A session, Mombeshora revealed that the country currently has only one qualified forensic pathologist, creating major challenges in conducting post-mortems, particularly in murder cases.\n\nHis remarks came after Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) MP Lynett Karenyi asked about government policy regarding medico-legal post-mortem examinations and the requirement for bodies to be transported from across Zimbabwe to Harare for assessment.\n\nOf late, there have been challenges with postmortems, especially forensic. These specialised procedures are indeed conducted by forensic pathologists who possess distinct training and expertise beyond that of general pathologists.\n\nApparently, we do not have enough forensic pathologists in the country. We have only one qualified forensic pathologist at the moment. We have relied on recruiting from outside the country, Mombeshora said.\n\nThe Health Minister added that the shortage of specialists has left the government struggling to meet demand, stressing that addressing the skills gap remains urgent hence government has recruited three forensic pathologists from Cuba.\n\nWe are all aware that we have had a challenge of brain drain. At some stage, we had more than three in the country who were trained.\n\nAlso, it is a department or a speciality where we have not really seen interest in our own doctors to specialise in. As a result, we have not had enough pathologists, Mombeshora added.\n\nThe minister said the just-recruited Cuban forensic pathologists started work on Wednesday, October 1.\n\nThese will actually help us in terms of carrying out forensic postmortems.\n\nAs a result, it was very difficult for one forensic pathologist to move around the country and in other hospitals, especially our district hospitals, Mombeshora added.\n\nHe told the august house that the mortuaries were not equipped with the requisite equipment needed to carry out forensic pathology.\n\nAs a result, dead bodies have to be moved either to Sally Mugabe, Parirenyatwa or Chitungwiza in Harare and the same in Bulawayo, Mpilo Hospital or United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH).\n\nThe pathologists will then give days to go to Bulawayo or do pathology examinations here in Harare. We hope that the incoming of the three new forensic pathologists will make their job much easier and enable them to go to other provincial hospitals where the equipment is available and carry out those pathology examinations.\n\nAsked by another legislator what government would do to stop the exodus of healthcare professionals, Mombeshora responded, We now have the Health Service Commission in place and they are working on incentives for various sectors in the medical field to see if we can come up with incentives including improved salaries, incentives of those who are working outside metropolitan areas so that we can stop the brain drain and have our own people working here instead of relying on foreign experts.\n\nHe added, We hope that by next year, we will be training more and then in the coming four years, that is when we may see more forensic pathologists coming out.\n\n",
