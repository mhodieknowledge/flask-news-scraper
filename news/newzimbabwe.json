            "content": "By Victor Oluwole l Business Insider Africa\n\nZIMBABWEAN billionaire Strive Masiyiwa is leading a new push to build AI infrastructure across Africa.Masiyiwa is a prominent African entrepreneur known for pioneering mobile telecommunications and challenging state-owned monopolies.He is currently focusing on developing digital infrastructure in Africa through his company Cassava Technologies.Masiyiwa plans to establish AI factories in five countries, specialized for artificial intelligence workloads.This initiative aims to empower local AI development, enhance data security, and position Africa as a leader in digital innovation.He became one of the first African businessmen to challenge state-owned telecom monopolies and win. That step made many people see him as a symbol of progress and determination in Africa.In recent years, he has stayed out of the public eye, but he has been quietly working on something much bigger. He is building a group of digital infrastructure companies that could play an important role in Africas technology future.This work is happening through his company Cassava Technologies. Cassava brings together several of his businesses that are focused on building and running the systems that make the internet work.These include fibre optic cables, data centres, and cloud computing services. Together, they are forming one of the strongest digital backbones in Africa.Through Liquid Intelligent Technologies, Cassava operates more than 100,000 kilometres of fibre optic cables that run through over a dozen African countries.These cables carry internet traffic between cities and countries every day. They connect millions of people, businesses, and public services. Having such a large network gives Cassava a strong base to support other digital services.Another part of Cassava is Africa Data Centres, which runs some of the biggest data storage and processing facilities on the continent.These data centres store and manage information for banks, companies, hospitals, schools, and government agencies. They are open to different internet providers and cloud service companies, which makes them useful to many organisations.Data centers are facilities that can provide the computing power often needed for AI operations.Cassava also runs cloud computing services through companies like Liquid C2 and Cloudmania. These provide secure digital tools and platforms that allow African businesses and public institutions to run their services locally without depending only on foreign providers.This infrastructure has taken many years to build. It gives Masiyiwa something that is rare in Africa. He controls not just one part of the digital system, but several layers of it.This puts him in a strong position as Africa begins to enter the era of artificial intelligence. He is now using this base to build what he calls AI factories across the continent.Recently, Masiyiwa announced plans to build five AI factories in South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, and Morocco.These will be special data centres designed to handle the massive computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The total investment is about 720 million US dollars.The first AI factory is already being built in South Africa. It will include around 3,000 powerful Nvidia graphics processors, which are the type of hardware used to train and run AI systems. Many African universities, researchers, and startups have already booked space to use this computing power.Cassava calls this plan the Sovereign AI Cloud. The goal is to give African countries and organisations the ability to develop and run their own AI systems inside Africa.Speaking in a conversation with James Manyika on the YouTube series AI & Africa | Dialogues on Technology and Society, Masiyiwa explained how he started paying close attention to AI around 2016.I was beginning to realize at that point that this is here now, he said.This is not something in the future.He compares its scale to one of the biggest shifts in human history.Ive been saying for a while that AI is not just like the internet; it is as big as the Industrial Revolution in its impact. The difference is the speed. The Industrial Revolution took a long time. This is going to happen in five or ten years, all that change compressed.Right now, most AI projects in Africa depend on cloud servers in Europe or North America. That is expensive and often slow. It can also raise concerns about data privacy and security.By building local AI infrastructure, Masiyiwa hopes to make it cheaper, faster, and safer for Africans to build and use new technologies.Reports say only about five percent of Africas AI talent currently has access to the powerful computing tools they need. Masiyiwa wants to change that and open access to many more people across the continent.His companies are also receiving support from international partnersThe International Finance Corporation has invested in Liquid Intelligent Technologies to help expand its data centres and fibre networks in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt. Cassava is also upgrading its existing data centres with Nvidia supercomputers so they can handle AI workloads.Large global technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon Web Services, Anthropic, and Nvidia have also worked with Cassava as partners or suppliers.In 2025, TIME magazine named Strive Masiyiwa to its TIME100 AI list and described his efforts as a major step forward for Africas digital future.If this plan works, it could help many areas of life in AfricaMasiyiwa believes Africa must not miss this opportunity. We dont want to be users any more than we want to be used, he said.We want to fully participate in the economic opportunity. Our entrepreneurs must feel they are part of this; that we are creating wealth, not just using platforms where others get the benefit.We are seeing no investment at all with respect to AI coming into Africa. No one is interested really from outside. More money comes into Africa from diaspora remittances than from foreign direct investment. Its not that our people dont have ideas. Theres no capital coming in to support those ideas, he said.AI-powered systems can help monitor crops, predict weather, and guide planting decisions.This is why Cassava has focused on building the infrastructure that can support the next generation.In healthcare, AI could help doctors find illnesses and keep patient records. In agriculture, it could help track weather, plan planting times, and grow more food.In education, it could help students learn in local languages. In banking, it could help find fraud, check credit records, and serve customers better.These tools work best when the computing power is close to where the data is collected. Building them in Africa could make them faster, cheaper, and more secure.There are still challengesAI factories and data centres use a lot of electricity, and many African countries do not have steady power supply.Bringing in advanced hardware like Nvidia chips can also be slow and expensive because of shipping delays and customs processes.There are not enough trained engineers, data scientists, and AI experts to run these systems, so more training will be needed. Each country also has its own rules about data protection, privacy, and taxes, and this can slow down projects.At the same time, global technology companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google are also building data centres in Africa. Cassava will have to compete with them while proving that its systems are reliable and affordable.But what makes Masiyiwas effort different is that it is homegrown and Pan-African.While many foreign companies are only just beginning to build in Africa, he has spent years quietly putting the foundation in place.He has built the fibre cables, the data centres, and the cloud systems that Africa will need for the future. Now he is connecting all these pieces and adding powerful AI infrastructure on top of them.If it works, the man who helped connect Africa to mobile phones may also be remembered as the man who helped connect Africa to the age of artificial intelligence.\n\nZIMBABWEAN billionaire Strive Masiyiwa is leading a new push to build AI infrastructure across Africa.\n\nMasiyiwa is a prominent African entrepreneur known for pioneering mobile telecommunications and challenging state-owned monopolies.He is currently focusing on developing digital infrastructure in Africa through his company Cassava Technologies.Masiyiwa plans to establish AI factories in five countries, specialized for artificial intelligence workloads.This initiative aims to empower local AI development, enhance data security, and position Africa as a leader in digital innovation.He became one of the first African businessmen to challenge state-owned telecom monopolies and win.

He is building a group of digital infrastructure companies that could play an important role in Africas technology future.This work is happening through his company Cassava Technologies. Cassava brings together several of his businesses that are focused on building and running the systems that make the internet work.These include fibre optic cables, data centres, and cloud computing services. Together, they are forming one of the strongest digital backbones in Africa.Through Liquid Intelligent Technologies, Cassava operates more than 100,000 kilometres of fibre optic cables that run through over a dozen African countries.These cables carry internet traffic between cities and countries every day. They connect millions of people, businesses, and public services. Having such a large network gives Cassava a strong base to support other digital services.Another part of Cassava is Africa Data Centres, which runs some of the biggest data storage and processing facilities on the continent.These data centres store and manage information for banks, companies, hospitals, schools, and government agencies. They are open to different internet providers and cloud service companies, which makes them useful to many organisations.Data centers are facilities that can provide the computing power often needed for AI operations.Cassava also runs cloud computing services through companies like Liquid C2 and Cloudmania. These provide secure digital tools and platforms that allow African businesses and public institutions to run their services locally without depending only on foreign providers.This infrastructure has taken many years to build. It gives Masiyiwa something that is rare in Africa. He controls not just one part of the digital system, but several layers of it.This puts him in a strong position as Africa begins to enter the era of artificial intelligence. He is now using this base to build what he calls AI factories across the continent.Recently, Masiyiwa announced plans to build five AI factories in South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, and Morocco.These will be special data centres designed to handle the massive computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The total investment is about 720 million US dollars.The first AI factory is already being built in South Africa. It will include around 3,000 powerful Nvidia graphics processors, which are the type of hardware used to train and run AI systems. Many African universities, researchers, and startups have already booked space to use this computing power.Cassava calls this plan the Sovereign AI Cloud. The goal is to give African countries and organisations the ability to develop and run their own AI systems inside Africa.Speaking in a conversation with James Manyika on the YouTube series AI & Africa | Dialogues on Technology and Society, Masiyiwa explained how he started paying close attention to AI around 2016.I was beginning to realize at that point that this is here now, he said.This is not something in the future.He compares its scale to one of the biggest shifts in human history.Ive been saying for a while that AI is not just like the internet; it is as big as the Industrial Revolution in its impact. The difference is the speed. The Industrial Revolution took a long time. This is going to happen in five or ten years, all that change compressed.Right now, most AI projects in Africa depend on cloud servers in Europe or North America. That is expensive and often slow. It can also raise concerns about data privacy and security.By building local AI infrastructure, Masiyiwa hopes to make it cheaper, faster, and safer for Africans to build and use new technologies.Reports say only about five percent of Africas AI talent currently has access to the powerful computing tools they need. Masiyiwa wants to change that and open access to many more people across the continent.His companies are also receiving support from international partnersThe International Finance Corporation has invested in Liquid Intelligent Technologies to help expand its data centres and fibre networks in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt. Cassava is also upgrading its existing data centres with Nvidia supercomputers so they can handle AI workloads.Large global technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon Web Services, Anthropic, and Nvidia have also worked with Cassava as partners or suppliers.In 2025, TIME magazine named Strive Masiyiwa to its TIME100 AI list and described his efforts as a major step forward for Africas digital future.If this plan works, it could help many areas of life in AfricaMasiyiwa believes Africa must not miss this opportunity. We dont want to be users any more than we want to be used, he said.We want to fully participate in the economic opportunity. Our entrepreneurs must feel they are part of this; that we are creating wealth, not just using platforms where others get the benefit.We are seeing no investment at all with respect to AI coming into Africa. No one is interested really from outside. More money comes into Africa from diaspora remittances than from foreign direct investment. Its not that our people dont have ideas. Theres no capital coming in to support those ideas, he said.AI-powered systems can help monitor crops, predict weather, and guide planting decisions.This is why Cassava has focused on building the infrastructure that can support the next generation.In healthcare, AI could help doctors find illnesses and keep patient records. In agriculture, it could help track weather, plan planting times, and grow more food.In education, it could help students learn in local languages. In banking, it could help find fraud, check credit records, and serve customers better.These tools work best when the computing power is close to where the data is collected. Building them in Africa could make them faster, cheaper, and more secure.There are still challengesAI factories and data centres use a lot of electricity, and many African countries do not have steady power supply.Bringing in advanced hardware like Nvidia chips can also be slow and expensive because of shipping delays and customs processes.There are not enough trained engineers, data scientists, and AI experts to run these systems, so more training will be needed. Each country also has its own rules about data protection, privacy, and taxes, and this can slow down projects.At the same time, global technology companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google are also building data centres in Africa. Cassava will have to compete with them while proving that its systems are reliable and affordable.But what makes Masiyiwas effort different is that it is homegrown and Pan-African.While many foreign companies are only just beginning to build in Africa, he has spent years quietly putting the foundation in place.He has built the fibre cables, the data centres, and the cloud systems that Africa will need for the future.

No one is interested really from outside. More money comes into Africa from diaspora remittances than from foreign direct investment. Its not that our people dont have ideas. Theres no capital coming in to support those ideas, he said.AI-powered systems can help monitor crops, predict weather, and guide planting decisions.This is why Cassava has focused on building the infrastructure that can support the next generation.In healthcare, AI could help doctors find illnesses and keep patient records. In agriculture, it could help track weather, plan planting times, and grow more food.In education, it could help students learn in local languages. In banking, it could help find fraud, check credit records, and serve customers better.These tools work best when the computing power is close to where the data is collected. Building them in Africa could make them faster, cheaper, and more secure.There are still challengesAI factories and data centres use a lot of electricity, and many African countries do not have steady power supply.Bringing in advanced hardware like Nvidia chips can also be slow and expensive because of shipping delays and customs processes.There are not enough trained engineers, data scientists, and AI experts to run these systems, so more training will be needed. Each country also has its own rules about data protection, privacy, and taxes, and this can slow down projects.At the same time, global technology companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google are also building data centres in Africa. Cassava will have to compete with them while proving that its systems are reliable and affordable.But what makes Masiyiwas effort different is that it is homegrown and Pan-African.While many foreign companies are only just beginning to build in Africa, he has spent years quietly putting the foundation in place.He has built the fibre cables, the data centres, and the cloud systems that Africa will need for the future. Now he is connecting all these pieces and adding powerful AI infrastructure on top of them.If it works, the man who helped connect Africa to mobile phones may also be remembered as the man who helped connect Africa to the age of artificial intelligence.\n\nAnother part of Cassava is Africa Data Centres, which runs some of the biggest data storage and processing facilities on the continent.\n\nThese data centres store and manage information for banks, companies, hospitals, schools, and government agencies. They are open to different internet providers and cloud service companies, which makes them useful to many organisations.Data centers are facilities that can provide the computing power often needed for AI operations.Cassava also runs cloud computing services through companies like Liquid C2 and Cloudmania. These provide secure digital tools and platforms that allow African businesses and public institutions to run their services locally without depending only on foreign providers.This infrastructure has taken many years to build. It gives Masiyiwa something that is rare in Africa. He controls not just one part of the digital system, but several layers of it.This puts him in a strong position as Africa begins to enter the era of artificial intelligence. He is now using this base to build what he calls AI factories across the continent.Recently, Masiyiwa announced plans to build five AI factories in South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, and Morocco.These will be special data centres designed to handle the massive computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The total investment is about 720 million US dollars.The first AI factory is already being built in South Africa. It will include around 3,000 powerful Nvidia graphics processors, which are the type of hardware used to train and run AI systems. Many African universities, researchers, and startups have already booked space to use this computing power.Cassava calls this plan the Sovereign AI Cloud. The goal is to give African countries and organisations the ability to develop and run their own AI systems inside Africa.Speaking in a conversation with James Manyika on the YouTube series AI & Africa | Dialogues on Technology and Society, Masiyiwa explained how he started paying close attention to AI around 2016.I was beginning to realize at that point that this is here now, he said.This is not something in the future.He compares its scale to one of the biggest shifts in human history.Ive been saying for a while that AI is not just like the internet; it is as big as the Industrial Revolution in its impact. The difference is the speed. The Industrial Revolution took a long time. This is going to happen in five or ten years, all that change compressed.Right now, most AI projects in Africa depend on cloud servers in Europe or North America. That is expensive and often slow. It can also raise concerns about data privacy and security.By building local AI infrastructure, Masiyiwa hopes to make it cheaper, faster, and safer for Africans to build and use new technologies.Reports say only about five percent of Africas AI talent currently has access to the powerful computing tools they need. Masiyiwa wants to change that and open access to many more people across the continent.His companies are also receiving support from international partnersThe International Finance Corporation has invested in Liquid Intelligent Technologies to help expand its data centres and fibre networks in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt. Cassava is also upgrading its existing data centres with Nvidia supercomputers so they can handle AI workloads.Large global technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon Web Services, Anthropic, and Nvidia have also worked with Cassava as partners or suppliers.In 2025, TIME magazine named Strive Masiyiwa to its TIME100 AI list and described his efforts as a major step forward for Africas digital future.If this plan works, it could help many areas of life in AfricaMasiyiwa believes Africa must not miss this opportunity.

Cassava will have to compete with them while proving that its systems are reliable and affordable.But what makes Masiyiwas effort different is that it is homegrown and Pan-African.While many foreign companies are only just beginning to build in Africa, he has spent years quietly putting the foundation in place.He has built the fibre cables, the data centres, and the cloud systems that Africa will need for the future. Now he is connecting all these pieces and adding powerful AI infrastructure on top of them.If it works, the man who helped connect Africa to mobile phones may also be remembered as the man who helped connect Africa to the age of artificial intelligence.\n\nRight now, most AI projects in Africa depend on cloud servers in Europe or North America. That is expensive and often slow. It can also raise concerns about data privacy and security.\n\nBy building local AI infrastructure, Masiyiwa hopes to make it cheaper, faster, and safer for Africans to build and use new technologies.Reports say only about five percent of Africas AI talent currently has access to the powerful computing tools they need. Masiyiwa wants to change that and open access to many more people across the continent.His companies are also receiving support from international partnersThe International Finance Corporation has invested in Liquid Intelligent Technologies to help expand its data centres and fibre networks in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt. Cassava is also upgrading its existing data centres with Nvidia supercomputers so they can handle AI workloads.Large global technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon Web Services, Anthropic, and Nvidia have also worked with Cassava as partners or suppliers.In 2025, TIME magazine named Strive Masiyiwa to its TIME100 AI list and described his efforts as a major step forward for Africas digital future.If this plan works, it could help many areas of life in AfricaMasiyiwa believes Africa must not miss this opportunity. We dont want to be users any more than we want to be used, he said.We want to fully participate in the economic opportunity. Our entrepreneurs must feel they are part of this; that we are creating wealth, not just using platforms where others get the benefit.We are seeing no investment at all with respect to AI coming into Africa. No one is interested really from outside. More money comes into Africa from diaspora remittances than from foreign direct investment. Its not that our people dont have ideas. Theres no capital coming in to support those ideas, he said.AI-powered systems can help monitor crops, predict weather, and guide planting decisions.This is why Cassava has focused on building the infrastructure that can support the next generation.In healthcare, AI could help doctors find illnesses and keep patient records. In agriculture, it could help track weather, plan planting times, and grow more food.In education, it could help students learn in local languages. In banking, it could help find fraud, check credit records, and serve customers better.These tools work best when the computing power is close to where the data is collected.

            "content": "By Karabo Ngoepe l Sunday Independent\n\nZIMBABWES politics has once again been dragged into the shadows of intrigue, poison, coup whispers and factional bloodletting.At the centre are President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his deputy, General Constantino Chiwenga, whose rivalry has broken out of State House backrooms and into the public arena. The result: a ruling party on edge and a nation watching nervously.For months, rumours have swirled about mysterious deaths among senior security officials, alleged purges to weaken Chiwengas military base and consolidate Mnangagwas hold on power.The speculation has been amplified by Blessed Runesu Geza, better known as Bombshell Geza. A war veteran turned YouTuber, expelled from Zanu-PF, Geza has reinvented himself as a digital provocateur, openly backing Chiwenga while branding Mnangagwa as corrupt, illegitimate, and destined to be toppled by a coup.This mix of propaganda, mistrust, and succession politics has created a volatile cocktail at the heart of the Zimbabwean state.The most sensational allegation is that General Anselem Sanyatwe, once Head of the Defence Forces and now Sports Minister, was poisoned. His fall from military command to a low-key cabinet role has long been seen as Mnangagwas attempt to cut Chiwengas influence.The story now doing the rounds is darker. Social media posts allege that Kudakwashe Queen Bee Tagwirei, Mnangagwas financier and ally, masterminded a poisoning plot against Sanyatwe. The claims say he was injected with a toxic substance at a public event in Nyanga before being flown to India for emergency treatment.Neither Sanyatwe nor his office has confirmed the claims. Instead, insiders insist his trip abroad was for ongoing medical care. He has been unwell for some time. His deployment back from Tanzania and later his removal from the army were linked to his health, one source told this publication.When he became Sports Minister, his condition worsened. He spent two months in India for treatment. He spent at least two months there and was not seen in the cabinet. It was a closely guarded secret, but detractors tried to cook up some rumours when he was there that his deployment to sports was a demotion and that he was boycotting meetings. That is not true; he was attending to his health. The rumours that he was poisoned in Nyanga are not true, the source said.The insider added that it was sad to see his health being used for cheap politicking. But in Zimbabwean politics, facts often matter less than perception. Poison stories have long been part of the playbook, from Mugabe-era whispers to Mnangagwas own alleged poisoning in 2017. They serve to terrify, to discredit, and to fracture alliances.For Chiwengas camp, the Sanyatwe narrative paints Mnangagwas circle as ruthless power-hunters. For Mnangagwas loyalists, it looks like a manufactured smear designed to drive a wedge between the president and the military.The rumours also target Tagwirei himself. Long seen as Mnangagwas banker, he was formally inducted into the Zanu-PF Central Committee in August 2025. That move cemented his shift from shadow financier to open political player.His sudden rise has unsettled Zanu-PFs liberation war veterans and the military elite. They view him as a civilian outsider with money but no liberation credentials, a figure Mnangagwa could be grooming as a successor or at least a kingmaker. For Chiwenga, who has always believed the presidency is his birthright, Tagwireis ascent is a direct challenge.Against this backdrop, poisoning allegations serve a purpose. They are less about proving what happened to Sanyatwe than about casting Tagwirei and Mnangagwa as untrustworthy usurpers, men willing to turn on allies to secure power.Into this combustible mix steps Geza. His YouTube rants, laced with military nostalgia and coup fantasies, have transformed Zanu-PFs succession fight into a digital street brawl. He portrays the army as Zimbabwes only salvation and Mnangagwa as a usurper, hinting openly that only a military takeover can restore order.Some see him as a brave whistleblower; others as a reckless agitator. But his influence is undeniable. His talk of carnage in the security forces has struck a chord with Zimbabweans long convinced that power is decided not at the ballot box, but in the barracks.Zimbabwe has walked this road before. Poison allegations, coup whispers, factional purges, they are the recurring features of its politics. But with Mnangagwa, now 82, the stakes are higher than ever. Succession is no longer theoretical.Poisoning rumours are not about evidence, one Harare-based analyst said.They are about perception. And in Zimbabwean succession politics, perception is power.Each whisper erodes trust. Each online rant widens the rift. Each allegation feeds paranoia in the barracks and boardrooms alike. This is how factional battles metastasise into national crises.The MnangagwaChiwenga rivalry will shape Zimbabwes next chapter. History suggests Zimbabwes succession fights rarely end quietly. The poison stories and coup whispers are not mere gossip; they are early warning signs.\n\nZIMBABWES politics has once again been dragged into the shadows of intrigue, poison, coup whispers and factional bloodletting.At the centre are President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his deputy, General Constantino Chiwenga, whose rivalry has broken out of State House backrooms and into the public arena.

The claims say he was injected with a toxic substance at a public event in Nyanga before being flown to India for emergency treatment.Neither Sanyatwe nor his office has confirmed the claims. Instead, insiders insist his trip abroad was for ongoing medical care. He has been unwell for some time. His deployment back from Tanzania and later his removal from the army were linked to his health, one source told this publication.When he became Sports Minister, his condition worsened. He spent two months in India for treatment. He spent at least two months there and was not seen in the cabinet. It was a closely guarded secret, but detractors tried to cook up some rumours when he was there that his deployment to sports was a demotion and that he was boycotting meetings. That is not true; he was attending to his health. The rumours that he was poisoned in Nyanga are not true, the source said.The insider added that it was sad to see his health being used for cheap politicking. But in Zimbabwean politics, facts often matter less than perception. Poison stories have long been part of the playbook, from Mugabe-era whispers to Mnangagwas own alleged poisoning in 2017. They serve to terrify, to discredit, and to fracture alliances.For Chiwengas camp, the Sanyatwe narrative paints Mnangagwas circle as ruthless power-hunters. For Mnangagwas loyalists, it looks like a manufactured smear designed to drive a wedge between the president and the military.The rumours also target Tagwirei himself. Long seen as Mnangagwas banker, he was formally inducted into the Zanu-PF Central Committee in August 2025. That move cemented his shift from shadow financier to open political player.His sudden rise has unsettled Zanu-PFs liberation war veterans and the military elite. They view him as a civilian outsider with money but no liberation credentials, a figure Mnangagwa could be grooming as a successor or at least a kingmaker. For Chiwenga, who has always believed the presidency is his birthright, Tagwireis ascent is a direct challenge.Against this backdrop, poisoning allegations serve a purpose. They are less about proving what happened to Sanyatwe than about casting Tagwirei and Mnangagwa as untrustworthy usurpers, men willing to turn on allies to secure power.Into this combustible mix steps Geza. His YouTube rants, laced with military nostalgia and coup fantasies, have transformed Zanu-PFs succession fight into a digital street brawl. He portrays the army as Zimbabwes only salvation and Mnangagwa as a usurper, hinting openly that only a military takeover can restore order.Some see him as a brave whistleblower; others as a reckless agitator. But his influence is undeniable. His talk of carnage in the security forces has struck a chord with Zimbabweans long convinced that power is decided not at the ballot box, but in the barracks.Zimbabwe has walked this road before. Poison allegations, coup whispers, factional purges, they are the recurring features of its politics. But with Mnangagwa, now 82, the stakes are higher than ever. Succession is no longer theoretical.Poisoning rumours are not about evidence, one Harare-based analyst said.They are about perception. And in Zimbabwean succession politics, perception is power.Each whisper erodes trust. Each online rant widens the rift. Each allegation feeds paranoia in the barracks and boardrooms alike. This is how factional battles metastasise into national crises.The MnangagwaChiwenga rivalry will shape Zimbabwes next chapter. History suggests Zimbabwes succession fights rarely end quietly. The poison stories and coup whispers are not mere gossip; they are early warning signs.\n\nThe most sensational allegation is that General Anselem Sanyatwe, once Head of the Defence Forces and now Sports Minister, was poisoned.
