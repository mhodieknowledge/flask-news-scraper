            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nNewZimbabwe.coms Business Reporter, Alois Vinga (AV) recently caught up with the recently appointed Buy Zimbabwe Brand Ambassador, Portia Muzorava (PM) to discuss the plans at hand as far as promoting local products is concerned. She is also a journalist working for MSU Radio Station. Below are the issues which the interview touched on.\n\nA.V: How are you? Can you share your background in brief?P.M: I am popularly known as Mambokadzi weSungura Popo. I am a media personality and social influencer with a deep passion for promoting Zimbabwean culture and identity. Over the years, I have worked to celebrate our local values, products, and creativity, always encouraging Zimbabweans to embrace and take pride in their own. My strong media presence has allowed me to connect with diverse audiences and become a trusted voice in championing issues that matter to communities.A.V: What are your plans as the new Buy Zimbabwe brand ambassador?P.M As the new Buy Zimbabwe brand ambassador, my main plan is to spearhead the promotion and awareness of the Buy Zimbabwe insignia. I will work to ensure it becomes a symbol of excellence, pride, and trust for both consumers and producers.Through campaigns, media engagements, and public outreach, I want to inspire Zimbabweans to support local products, which in turn empowers communities, creates jobs, and strengthens our economy. I will also focus on giving visibility to member companies and showcasing their innovation at platforms such as the Zimbabwe Agricultural Show (ZAS) and YAFEST.A.V: How do you intend to deal with challenges affecting local manufacturers?P.M: Local manufacturers are facing challenges such as stiff competition from imports, limited consumer awareness of local product quality, and issues around market visibility. Some are also hampered by misconceptions that foreign products are superior. My role is to help address these challenges by driving consumer confidence in Zimbabwean goods through brand promotion, storytelling, and campaigns that highlight the quality, cultural value, and impact of buying local. By amplifying the Buy Zimbabwe message, I aim to shift mindsets and encourage more people to buy local.A.V: How are you going to make sure that the Buy Zimbabwe campaign reaches both the local and foreign markets?P.M: Locally, I will leverage my media influence and public platforms to build strong consumer awareness and pride in Zimbabwean products.Regionally and internationally, we will position the Buy Zimbabwe insignia as a mark of trusted quality and sustainability, appealing to diaspora communities and foreign buyers who are increasingly drawn to authentic, proudly African brands. Participating in trade fairs, cultural festivals, and strategic media campaigns will also help us carry the Buy Zimbabwe message beyond our borders.A.V: What are your targets up to year end?P.M: By year end, I aim to achieve three main targets: To significantly increase consumer awareness of the Buy Zimbabwe insignia. To ensure that member products gain stronger visibility and recognition at major platforms like the Agricultural Show and YAFEST. To establish Buy Zimbabwe as not just a campaign, but a household brand symbolizing quality, pride, and trust.A.V: How are you going to assist local manufacturers in reducing the cost of doing business?P. M: While I cannot directly reduce production costs, my role is to ensure that local manufacturers receive the recognition, visibility, and consumer loyalty they deserve. If more consumers consistently choose Zimbabwean products, it will help local companies achieve economies of scale, which can in turn lower costs.At the same time, through advocacy and dialogue, I will continue to amplify the concerns of our manufacturers so that together with policymakers, suppliers, and other stakeholders, we can build an enabling environment that supports sustainable local industries.\n\nA.V: How are you?

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nZIMBABWEs land reform programme of the year 2000 was necessary for the country to put its black people at the forefront of productive agriculture, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has said.\n\nOfficially opening this years Zimbabwe Agricultural Show (ZAS) in Harare this Friday, Ramaphosa commended the Government of Zimbabwe for the momentous task of dismantling colonial-era patterns of land ownership where the black majority was confined to communal lands.On independence in 1980, the new democratic Government of Zimbabwe had to take on the momentous task of dismantling colonial-era patterns of land ownership.Most of the countrys commercially productive land and large-scale commercial farms were owned by whites. The black majority was confined to communal lands and all but completely excluded from commercial farming.This mirrored our own experience in South Africa.It was, therefore, essential for both historical redress and food security, development and economic growth that the government embarked on ambitious reforms to facilitate the entry of black Zimbabweans into productive agriculture, including support to small-scale farmers, Ramaphosa said.He also congratulated Zimbabwe for the measures being taken to revive the countrys agricultural sector through policy reforms, investment in irrigation and mechanisation, and empowering large and small-scale farmers.We know that the agricultural sector has been heavily affected by the growing impacts of the changing climate.Severe drought has impacted crop yields in recent years.Adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change are an imperative for all nations. Collaboration among countries is critical to the success of these efforts, added the South African President.He said: Biosecurity is another area in which Zimbabwe and South Africa must step up cooperation.Outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, avian or bird flu, crop infections and others, call on us to pool our resources and strengthen our collaboration, including through our respective research institutions.The SA President explained that technological trends in agriculture must be fully embraced to increase output and conserve resources.By way of example, geo-spacial agriculture using earth observation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has started to feature in some sectors of agriculture in South Africa and Zimbabwe.Such innovation will be key as we collectively build resilience in pursuit of food security, he stated.Even amidst these challenges, Ramaphosa said a constant feature at ZAS had been the commitment to use agriculture as a catalyst for economic growth, sustainable development and historical redress.The hosting of this agriculture show resonates with the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme, which seeks to improve domestic production and marketing as well as the facilitation of regional trade in food staples.It will also help to make our industries more competitive in the global trading market and to make use of the substantial opportunities of the African Continental Free Trade Area, he stated.According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), agriculture accounts for between 60 and 80 percent of employment in the region.We must, therefore, work towards a more enabling regulatory environment to further boost this sector.We need increased investment in small and medium farming entities, particularly those owned and run by women and the youth.President (Emmerson) Mnangagwa and I recently attended the SADC Summit in Madagascar, where agricultural transformation in the region was a major point of discussion.I call on the private sectors in both Zimbabwe and South Africa to use this show to explore avenues for great collaboration that will result in more trade and investment across our borders.Agricultural cooperation is key to sustaining jobs.We need investment in the provision of seeds, training, irrigation schemes, storage facilities and in agro-processing.The development of road, rail and aviation infrastructure is a key catalyst to take agriculture to an even higher level, Ramaphosa added.\n\nOfficially opening this years Zimbabwe Agricultural Show (ZAS) in Harare this Friday, Ramaphosa commended the Government of Zimbabwe for the momentous task of dismantling colonial-era patterns of land ownership where the black majority was confined to communal lands.\n\nOn independence in 1980, the new democratic Government of Zimbabwe had to take on the momentous task of dismantling colonial-era patterns of land ownership.Most of the countrys commercially productive land and large-scale commercial farms were owned by whites.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA top official has highlighted the need for stronger systems to safeguard the remittances and investments of Zimbabweans abroad, emphasizing governments commitment to protecting and supporting the diasporas contributions to national development.\n\nZimbabweans abroad contribute significantly to the national fiscus, accounting for an estimated 10 percent of the countrys domestic product.\n\nThese remittance flows have been pivotal in contributing to the countrys revenue, prompting the Deputy Minister of Youth Empowerment, Development and Vocational Training, Kudakwashe Mupamhanga, to call for the government to introduce incentives for Zimbabweans abroad.\n\nMupamhanga was speaking at the ZAA Diaspora Forum in Harare organised by Destiny Media Group.\n\nAnything that encourages the diaspora to get more and more involved in their country I represent a rural area. I like to be biased towards the rural area where diaspora investment can come and partner with the Government in developing our rural areas. Everyone has a kumusha [home] that they came from. Everyone has roots; those people need the diaspora to play ball. It is not just about sending money for medication but also getting involved in the rural district councils, said Mupamhanga.\n\nThe forum brought together Zimbabweans based abroad and policymakers to explore investment opportunities. It was part of the two-day programme which concludes Saturday with an awards gala at the Manna Resorts.\n\nSpeaking at the same event, the UK Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Peter Vowles, said it was vital for Zimbabweans in the diaspora to plough back their experiences into local communities.\n\nMany Zimbabweans in the diaspora are building lives around the world, including in the UK. Many Zimbabweans in the UK dream or plan to return home, and as a British Ambassador, one of the great privileges is meeting British citizens with Zimbabwean heritage coming home. You are bringing back experiences, ideas, and energy that can shape Zimbabwes future, said Vowles.\n\n",
