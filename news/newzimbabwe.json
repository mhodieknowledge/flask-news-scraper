            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nAS Zimbabwe commemorates the International Day of Peace today, September 21, a human rights watchdog, the Zimbabwe Peace Project (ZPP), has called upon political parties across the spectrum to prioritise policies that safeguard human rights and deliver essential services.\n\nIn a statement this Saturday, ZPP said when citizens notice equitable distribution of resources, functioning social services, and policies that uphold dignity, they are more inclined to build peace among themselves and extend it to others.The call comes as the the country continues to grapple with threats to peace in the form of persistent human rights violations.ZPP said peace will flourish when citizens are empowered, livelihoods secured, and communities benefit tangibly from national resources, where this would nurture social cohesion, an ideal which is already envisioned in National Development Strategies (NDS).In a country where the populace is losing social benefits such as pensions, citizens have felt neglected, fuelling tensions in almost all sectors.ZPP warned that failure to have protection of socio-economic rights will result in political promises ringing hollow, triggering frustration and disillusionment.The peace threats were said to be more prominent during politically sensitive periods, where violence, intimidation, and exclusionary tactics expose the fragility of peace at a time when collective tolerance is most needed.Upholding non-violence, fairness, and transparency in all the enjoyment of socio-economic rights is central to peace.A hungry, unemployed, and excluded population cannot be expected to prioritise peace when survival itself is at stake, ZPP said.According to the ZPP, peace is not built on slogans but on peoples lived experiences.On this International Day of Peace, ZPP urges every Zimbabwean, leaders, institutions, civil society, and communities, to recommit to peace, not only in words but in action. Together, we can reimagine and realise a Zimbabwe where peace is not fragile but firm, not conditional but guaranteed, and not postponed but lived every day.This year alone, ZPP has documented 891 human rights violations, and these have affected over 38,400 people across provinces (38,417 people affected, 20,627 women, 17,790 men with 553 PWDs), added ZPP.ZPP called for concrete and collective action to the civil society and Community-Based Organisations to deepen grassroots peace-building, document violations, and hold duty-bearers accountable while fostering inclusive dialogue across divides.Political parties must put the nation above partisan interests; uphold non-violence, fairness, and transparency in all political processes to state institutions.Independent commissions should strengthen accountability mechanisms, protect rights without fear or favour, and build trust with citizens.To the international community, ZPP urged support to Zimbabwes peace-building initiatives with technical, diplomatic, and financial assistance, ensuring that human rights and socio-economic justice remain central to development partnerships.Peace is not an abstract dream; it is the practical outcome of justice, fairness, and accountability.

Our country Zimbabwe is, indeed, on a reversible journey towards vision 2030.\n\nThis modern infrastructure serves as a source of pride for the veterans of the liberation struggle, who fought so that all our people can have a higher quality of life, he said.\n\nThe project will provide 300 residential flats and 750 student apartments.\n\nThe project also provided over 3 000 job opportunities benefiting members of the Zvishavane community and others.\n\nThe local community also benefitted from upgraded water and sanitary systems as well as improved road networks following the introduction of the project.\n\nWork resumed in March last year and has been completed.\n\nMnangangwa said project is a symbol of national unity and progress, adding his government will continue pushing towards achieving such high-quality projects countrywide.\n\nThis is the standard and work we must uphold across all our entities.The residential flats are investments in the dignity of our people through quality living space.\n\nMnangagwa also said the success of this project demonstrates the power of private public partnerships, further applauding the PSPF and its partners.\n\nFirst Mutual Wealth provided the land, while the majority of the capital, approximately 97%, was invested by the PSPF, with First Mutual acting as project manager, according to Douglas Hoto, chairman and group chief executive officer of First Mutual Holdings.\n\n",
