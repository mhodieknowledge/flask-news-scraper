            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE Mutare High Court has dismissed an application by Rusape Town Council seeking to permanently bar a local resident from publicly criticising the municipality over its controversial tender processes.\n\nJustice Sijabuliso Siziba handed down the ruling on Thursday, discharging an interim interdict previously granted in March against Takudzwa Noel Mwashaenyi.The interdict had prohibited Mwashaenyi from posting or circulating materials on social media relating to a $850,000 tender awarded to Hurntspine Enterprises (Pvt) Ltd for the redevelopment of a municipal building into a modern shopping mall.The council, represented by Absalom & Shepherd Attorneys, accused Mwashaenyi of defamation, alleging that he had circulated false and damaging information on WhatsApp and email, claiming the tender process was corrupt, lacked transparency, and that the winning firm was unqualified.In response, Mwashaenyi, through his lawyer, Leonard Chigadza of the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) argued that his actions were protected under the constitutional right to freedom of expression.He insisted his comments constituted fair public criticism and were based on publicly available information.Justice Siziba ruled that, as a public body, Rusape Town Council had no legal standing to seek protection from reputational harm through a defamation interdict.A local authority like the applicant cannot be allowed to muzzle public criticism under the guise that its reputation is at stake, the judge wrote, citing both Zimbabwean and international case law emphasising the need for transparency and democratic accountability.The judge further noted that although some of Mwashaenyis claims were inaccurate and misinformed, including allegations about the non-existence of the developer and claims of improper payments, this did not justify limiting his freedom of expression.Being a public body and a State organ, a local authority is there to serve the public and it cannot therefore be allowed to sue for defamation to protect its own public image or pecuniary interests, the judgment read.There can be no doubt that the freedom of expression, coupled with the corollary right to receive and impart information, is a core value of any democratic society deserving of the utmost legal protection.As such, it is prominently recognised and entrenched in virtually every international and regional human rights instrument, Siziba noted.He added, This court too has had occasion to recognise the freedom of expression as a core value of a free and democratic society.The importance of the right to freedom of expression has often been stressed by our courts. Suppression of available information and of ideas can only be detrimental to the decision-making process of individuals, corporations and governments.It may lead to the wrong government being elected, the wrong policies being adopted, the wrong people being appointed, corruption, dishonesty and incompetence not being exposed, wrong investments being made and a multitude of other undesirable consequences.It is for this reason that it has been said that freedom of expression constitutes one of the essential foundations of a democratic society and is one of the basic conditions for its progress and the development of man.He ruled, I am therefore convinced that the interdict sought by the applicant is not supported by the law. It is contrary to it. Its effect will be far reaching in curtailing the fundamental rights of the citizens to express themselves and freely monitor the activities of local authorities to the detriment of good governance and service delivery.On the basis of the above considerations, the application cannot succeed for lack of merit.The court dismissed all preliminary objections raised by both parties and made no order as to costs.\n\nJustice Sijabuliso Siziba handed down the ruling on Thursday, discharging an interim interdict previously granted in March against Takudzwa Noel Mwashaenyi.\n\nThe interdict had prohibited Mwashaenyi from posting or circulating materials on social media relating to a $850,000 tender awarded to Hurntspine Enterprises (Pvt) Ltd for the redevelopment of a municipal building into a modern shopping mall.The council, represented by Absalom & Shepherd Attorneys, accused Mwashaenyi of defamation, alleging that he had circulated false and damaging information on WhatsApp and email, claiming the tender process was corrupt, lacked transparency, and that the winning firm was unqualified.In response, Mwashaenyi, through his lawyer, Leonard Chigadza of the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) argued that his actions were protected under the constitutional right to freedom of expression.He insisted his comments constituted fair public criticism and were based on publicly available information.Justice Siziba ruled that, as a public body, Rusape Town Council had no legal standing to seek protection from reputational harm through a defamation interdict.A local authority like the applicant cannot be allowed to muzzle public criticism under the guise that its reputation is at stake, the judge wrote, citing both Zimbabwean and international case law emphasising the need for transparency and democratic accountability.The judge further noted that although some of Mwashaenyis claims were inaccurate and misinformed, including allegations about the non-existence of the developer and claims of improper payments, this did not justify limiting his freedom of expression.Being a public body and a State organ, a local authority is there to serve the public and it cannot therefore be allowed to sue for defamation to protect its own public image or pecuniary interests, the judgment read.There can be no doubt that the freedom of expression, coupled with the corollary right to receive and impart information, is a core value of any democratic society deserving of the utmost legal protection.As such, it is prominently recognised and entrenched in virtually every international and regional human rights instrument, Siziba noted.He added, This court too has had occasion to recognise the freedom of expression as a core value of a free and democratic society.The importance of the right to freedom of expression has often been stressed by our courts.

            "content": "By Tapiwa Svondo\n\nWHAT I would like her to know is that I dont want her to live; its better for her to die and just follow your husband. Thats the only way I will find peace.\n\nThese chilling words from Mercy Sinoia, sister of slain taxi operator Aleck Sinoia, encapsulate the raw grief and unyielding demand for punishment from a family convinced his ex-wife orchestrated his brutal murder.Their sentiments come as the accused, Apirizi Sekai (41), and her tenant Munyaradzi Munyaradzi (24), appeared this week before the Chegutu Magistrates Court.Sekai and Munyaradzi were remanded in custody until July 30, 2025, and advised to seek bail at the High Court.They stand accused of hiring hitmen to kill Aleck Sinoia, a local taxi operator, a crime the family claims is the culmination of years of bitter disputes and manipulative behavior from Sekai.In an interview with NewZimbababwe.com, Yeukai Kota, Sinoias niece, painted a vivid picture of the couples stormy history, marked by frequent police interventions.Even though my uncle had taken a second wife, he would visit her because he cared about her and the kids, but eventually she did him bad and took a peace order on him, accusing him that he had raped her.He spent days in remand prison but eventually got out after the court found it was fake because she wanted his fortunes.The family only found out that Sekai was the mastermind behind their brothers death just days after they buried him.We only found out two days later after we buried my brother that Sekai planned his death, when we were informed that she paid her tenant $200 to cripple my brother but then they took away his life.Even if the courts havent decided this case, its the truth because she once took her family members to beat up my brother, and we also retaliated, said Mercy Sinoia.Rodwell Tshuma, a close friend of the now deceased, expressed his profound shock and a new-found fear.I saw my friends body at the mortuary, and I was really pained when I saw the way he was mutilated.He would share his marital problems with me, and when I heard that his former wife had a hand in his death, I started fearing women. I would wish the courts to sentence her to life in prison, said Tshuma.According to the National Prosecuting Authority, Sekai allegedly approached her tenant, Munyaradzi, to find individuals who could eliminate her former husband.The first accused person allegedly approached the second accused person who is her tenant and requested him to look for a person who could kill her ex-husband, the now deceased.The first accused person had a long standing dispute with her former husband over infidelity and property sharing after their separation. The second accused person approached Cleopas Gomarara who roped in one Jefu.The two hired men approached the now deceased purporting to seek a car for hire to Chegutu Hospital. They ambushed the now-deceased, deflated the tyres of the motor vehicle before they stabbed him several times all over the body and disappeared from the scene, said the prosecution.\n\nThese chilling words from Mercy Sinoia, sister of slain taxi operator Aleck Sinoia, encapsulate the raw grief and unyielding demand for punishment from a family convinced his ex-wife orchestrated his brutal murder.\n\nTheir sentiments come as the accused, Apirizi Sekai (41), and her tenant Munyaradzi Munyaradzi (24), appeared this week before the Chegutu Magistrates Court.Sekai and Munyaradzi were remanded in custody until July 30, 2025, and advised to seek bail at the High Court.They stand accused of hiring hitmen to kill Aleck Sinoia, a local taxi operator, a crime the family claims is the culmination of years of bitter disputes and manipulative behavior from Sekai.In an interview with NewZimbababwe.com, Yeukai Kota, Sinoias niece, painted a vivid picture of the couples stormy history, marked by frequent police interventions.Even though my uncle had taken a second wife, he would visit her because he cared about her and the kids, but eventually she did him bad and took a peace order on him, accusing him that he had raped her.He spent days in remand prison but eventually got out after the court found it was fake because she wanted his fortunes.The family only found out that Sekai was the mastermind behind their brothers death just days after they buried him.We only found out two days later after we buried my brother that Sekai planned his death, when we were informed that she paid her tenant $200 to cripple my brother but then they took away his life.Even if the courts havent decided this case, its the truth because she once took her family members to beat up my brother, and we also retaliated, said Mercy Sinoia.Rodwell Tshuma, a close friend of the now deceased, expressed his profound shock and a new-found fear.I saw my friends body at the mortuary, and I was really pained when I saw the way he was mutilated.He would share his marital problems with me, and when I heard that his former wife had a hand in his death, I started fearing women.

The institution is grappling with chronic drug shortages, a severe water crisis, sewer blockages, food insecurity, overcrowding and deteriorating infrastructure.It is currently housing over 650 patients, well beyond its intended capacity. Due to lack of water, the hospital has been forced to outsource meals from Mpilo Central Hospital, transporting food daily, a significant financial burden.Sanitation has become a critical concern as well. Honourable Speaker, without the necessary medication to calm them, patients often become agitated and very difficult to manage at some point.Hospital staff is traumatised in dealing with such an overwhelming situation, especially if the patient becomes violent and dangerous, said Ncube.Ncube added that patients are being forced to use blankets instead of toilet paper, an indication of the dire conditions at the institutions.Sanitation has become a critical concern as well.

If you go to Ingutsheni, you will realise that there is a shortage of medically trained staff. The hospital continues to lose staff who are going for greener pastures.Some of them are going to the private sector and some are going to the diaspora. So, the patient-to-staff ratio is continuously getting worse at any given time. I want to encourage us as parliamentarians to make sure that the welfare, the remuneration and the benefits of the staff who are working at mental health hospitals are seriously reviewed to make sure that we do not continue to lose them, said Molokela.Health facilities across the country are deteriorating, a decline observers attribute to years of neglect and underfunding by the government.\n\nMental health facilities in Zimbabwe have become a focal point in Parliament, with legislators bemoaning the deterioration of the institutions, leaving the poor at the mercy of private practitioners who charge exorbitant fees.\n\nSpeaking in the National Assembly recently, Lungile Ncube lamented the poor state of mental health facilities, particularly Ngomahuru in Masvingo and Ingutsheni in Bulawayo.Turning back to Ingutsheni Hospital, the situation is nothing short of heartbreaking.

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nFORMER Highlanders coach Kelvin Kaindu is poised for a sensational return to Zimbabwe as he is close to signing a deal with fading giants Dynamos in a technical shake-up at the embattled Castle Lager Premier Soccer League side.\n\nKaindu is set to replace Saul Chaminuka, who is on his way out of Dynamos after struggling to steer the Harare giants out of the murky waters in which they find themselves.Chaminuka replaced Lloyd Chigowe at the helm of Dynamos in May but only managed to win once, against Yadah FC at Rufaro, in a match where they stumbled to victory by luck.Under Chaminuka, Dynamos have not scored a goal in the past six matches and have collected just two points, remaining winless and leaving the side occupying the 17th spot on the PSL table.As a result, Dynamos are facing the embarrassing prospect of relegation if their fortunes do not change.Without disclosing much, an insider confirmed that Dynamos are at an advanced stage of negotiations with Kaindu.We have shown Chaminuka the exit door. It was about time that he had to go. It appears it was a mistake appointing him as coach. Dynamos is a big institution that has outgrown even its founding members, and it needs someone with a higher pedigree. We are almost done with Kaindu, said the insider.Should Kaindu finalise the Dynamos deal, he will have a lot on his plate, as he must turn the clubs fortunes around and make an immediate impact.Dynamos are seven points from safety and will need a streak of maximum points to pull themselves out of the quagmire.The Zambian coach will also have to work his magic on Dynamos strike force, which has been blunt this season, with the clubs top scorer being defender Shadreck Nyahwa, who has netted just two goals.When contacted for comment, Kaindu was coy but indicated the prospect of returning to Zimbabwe.Zim is my home, said Kaindu curtly.\n\nKaindu is set to replace Saul Chaminuka, who is on his way out of Dynamos after struggling to steer the Harare giants out of the murky waters in which they find themselves.\n\nChaminuka replaced Lloyd Chigowe at the helm of Dynamos in May but only managed to win once, against Yadah FC at Rufaro, in a match where they stumbled to victory by luck.Under Chaminuka, Dynamos have not scored a goal in the past six matches and have collected just two points, remaining winless and leaving the side occupying the 17th spot on the PSL table.As a result, Dynamos are facing the embarrassing prospect of relegation if their fortunes do not change.Without disclosing much, an insider confirmed that Dynamos are at an advanced stage of negotiations with Kaindu.We have shown Chaminuka the exit door.
