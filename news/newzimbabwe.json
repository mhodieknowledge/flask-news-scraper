Zimbabwe Zhou Ding said on Friday.\n\nSpeaking to journalists on the sidelines of the reception held in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare ahead of the 76th anniversary of the founding of the Peoples

It is politics delaying the opening of these borders, which in our opinion is inevitable.\n\nGovernment has the tendency to inflate growth estimates and the market warned several months ago that they were significantly overestimating the maize crop.\n\nCurrent supply is extremely tight and millers are already dipping into reserves. If borders are not opened within the next few weeks, millers could struggle to meet consumer maize meal demand.\n\nWhereas Pienaar estimates Zimbabwe needs an extra 1.1 million tonnes, the US Foreign Agricultural Services believes current supply will fall short by around 700,000 tonnes despite a notable increase in production.\n\nThe 2024/25 season produced an estimated 1.3 million tonnes against a national demand of two million tonnes. Government maintains that farmers produced 2.3 million tonnes and ensured Zimbabwe will be food secure.\n\nWATCH:https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=wW5pyxHYB8qmYn76&v=CDgz1y_LweQ&feature=youtu.be\n\n",
