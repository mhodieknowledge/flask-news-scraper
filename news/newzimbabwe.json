            "content": "By James Muonwa\n\nHIGHLANDERS Football Club could soon be pocketing hefty transfer fees for its prodigy Prince Ndlovu after South African premiership side Orlando Pirates expressed interest in the player.\n\nAccording to recent media reports coming from across the Limpopo, Pirates are racing against European interest to sign Ndlovu, with his club demanding a record-breaking R15m.\n\nOrlando Pirates lead the local charge, but theyre not alone. Zimbabwes brightest football talent has sparked a bidding war as Highlanders FC demand a jaw-dropping R15 million for teenage winger Prince Ndlovu The move has sent shockwaves through South African football circles, an SA publication wrote.\n\nNdlovu, often referred to as the next Peter Ndlovu, has long attracted interest from top clubs, having previously trained with the Buccaneers in Houghton before a failed European stint. Now, with his stock soaring, Highlanders are playing hardball.\n\nHighlanders FC value Prince (Ndlovu) and thats why they are pricing him at around R15 million. The club believe its a fair price looking at his talent, quality and future ahead of him, a club official said, as quoted by Soccer Laduma.\n\nHighlanders play the long game as bids loom\n\nThe Bulawayo giants arent rushing to cash in. Their valuation isnt just based on local interest, its also shaped by serious attention from abroad.\n\nApart from Orlando Pirates there is a European club that has been monitoring him for some time now. Its Sturm Graz from the Austria Bundesliga, a source revealed.\n\nThis European connection could tip the scale and inflate the price further.\n\nA R15 million fee would rank among the highest for any player moving directly from the Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League. Its a bold statement from Highlanders, and a sign of just how highly they rate the 19-year-old winger.\n\nNdlovu was recently donning national colours at the COSAFA Cup in Bloemfontein, offering football scouts from across the continent a front-row seat to evaluate his explosive potential. Pirates are believed to have sent representatives to monitor him closely.\n\n",

compared to April 2025.\n\nIn a report released Saturday, the human rights watchdog documented 83 human rights violations across various areas, including during government-led food aid distribution, instances of political harassment, and restrictions on freedom of assembly and expression.\n\nIn May 2025, the Zimbabwe Peace Project recorded a total of 83 human rights violations affecting 5,376 victims nationwide, a 10% decline from the violations recorded in May where 6,059 people were affected, part of the report reads.\n\nThese violations included breaches of personal security, acts of intimidation and harassment, assault, political discrimination in the distribution of government-sponsored food aid, restrictions on freedoms of expression, assembly, and association, as well as limited access to social services.\n\nOther incidents included unjustified arrests, unlawful evictions, malicious damage to property, inhumane and degrading treatment, and restricted access to information.\n\nFor the second consecutive month, ZanuPF has been identified as the primary perpetrator of violence, followed by the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP).\n\nOf the 5,376 people affected, 3,107 were female and 2,269 were male.\n\nThe report detailed some of the alleged perpetrators.\n\nAmong the perpetrators, those affiliated with the ruling party, Zanu PF, accounted for 35.38%, followed by members of the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) at 13.77%.Other violators included local authorities (16.53%), government officials (11.44%), artisanal miners (5.93%), traditional leaders (6.14%), members of the MDC-Alliance (0.64%) and unaffiliated individuals (6.36%).Worryingly, members of the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) are also implicated, accounting for 0.21% of reported violations.The report highlights that other State security actors, particularly those mandated to protect the public, continue to feature prominently among perpetrators of human rights violations.Despite these concerns, the ZPP expresses cautious optimism about the potential for future improvements.It welcomed and embraced the opportunity to engage with the Zimbabwe Independent Complaints Commission (ZICC) through its goodwill ambassador to promote a rights-based, accountable approach in security operations.We are hopeful that other implicated institutions will be open to such engagements, paving the way for lasting solutions to end impunity and foster sustainable peace in Zimbabwe, the report adds.Geographically, Masvingo and Harare provinces recorded the highest number of violations in May, with 13 each.Midlands followed closely with 12 violations, while Manicaland and Mashonaland West each documented 10.Mashonaland Central experienced a significant decline, from 13 violations the previous month to just four in May.Mashonaland East recorded nine violations, while both Matabeleland North and South recorded six breaches each.ZPP commended the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) for highlighting urgent issues needing government action, including collapsing public services, a shrinking civic space, and restrictive conditions.\n\nAmong the perpetrators,

But now she is homeless and in debt  this is her story\n\nLONDON Thousands of overseas workers hired by care companies across Britain have been left broke and desperate after losing their jobs in what campaigners say is a national crisis.In 2022, Britain launched a visa scheme to encourage migrant workers to bolster its ailing care sector. About 150,000 have arrived from countries including India, Nigeria and Zimbabwe.But reports of exploitation have soared.The government has since banned hundreds of companies from sponsoring migrant workers  but this has left carers they had already hired jobless and terrified of deportation.Zola, a 45-year-old Zimbabwean care worker, was recruited by a firm in the northern city of Leeds in 2023 but is now 10,000 ($13,500) in debt.She told her story to Context but asked to use a pseudonym for fear of repercussions.The way weve been treated is outrageous. We were encouraged to come here to contribute our skills, but the jobs never materialised and now were trapped in debt.We came here in good faith, but other people have used us to fatten their own pockets. Revoking these companies licences is not enough. They need to be held accountable, and so does the government.The first shock when I arrived was the accommodation. They promised us housing, but the property was crammed with people and under renovation. There were bed bugs, there was no heating and we had to use a bucket to wash ourselves.I thought Id start work immediately, but they kept saying they were losing clients and didnt have shifts.I think they had hired about 100 of us because we were all in a large WhatsApp group. My annual salary was supposed to be 20,480, but I only received a few shifts and was paid 930 in total in all the time I was with the company.We were caring for people in their own homes. Shifts started early and finished at 10 at night, but they only paid for the time you spent in clients homes, not the time you were on call.By October, it was very cold outside and we had nowhere to go between appointments so Id spend hours riding around and around the city on buses just to stay warm.If the carers complained about anything, the managers would threaten to remove them from the rota or report them to the Home Office. Everyone was afraid of losing their visa and getting deported. There were constant threats.Then last year the company lost its sponsor licence so I have to find a new sponsor.The emotional and financial strain has affected me very badly mentally, especially as my children are still in Harare.When I applied for my visa, the government said carers could bring their children. I was hoping my children would join me once I got established, but that never happened.Now I dread calls from home  I took the job hoping to create a better life for my children, but I cant even provide them with the basics, which breaks my heart. Sometimes my daughter is crying because she misses me. Its gut-wrenching.Back in Zimbabwe, I was working as a sales rep for a farm, but they were struggling to keep afloat. Im a single mum with three kids so I needed to find something else.My sister told me the UK was looking for care workers so I quit my job and did a Red Cross course and a work placement to get experience.I heard about a company that would sponsor me for 5,000. It seemed expensive, but some people were paying 10,000. I only discovered later it was illegal to charge these fees.I borrowed money from friends and relatives and my kids moved in with my mum. There were other expenses for things like an English test, police background check, my visa and flight, so altogether I paid about 7,000.But Ive had to borrow even more money since coming here just to survive. Ive had to use food banks or ask for groceries from the church. A friend of my sister has given me a place to sleep.Its very difficult to find a new sponsor because companies providing home care ask for a driving licence. Another problem is they often want six months experience, but some carers lost their jobs soon after arriving here.The government is partly to blame because they allowed these companies to sponsor a lot of people without doing background checks to see if they had enough work for everyone.So yes, the government should be held accountable. I came here through the proper channels, I did everything they asked, and now Im treated like someone who came through the back door.Ive thought about going back to Zimbabwe so many times, but then I remember how much I owe everyone.

It seemed expensive, but some people were paying 10,000. I only discovered later it was illegal to charge these fees.I borrowed money from friends and relatives and my kids moved in with my mum. There were other expenses for things like an English test, police background check, my visa and flight, so altogether I paid about 7,000.But Ive had to borrow even more money since coming here just to survive. Ive had to use food banks or ask for groceries from the church. A friend of my sister has given me a place to sleep.Its very difficult to find a new sponsor because companies providing home care ask for a driving licence. Another problem is they often want six months experience, but some carers lost their jobs soon after arriving here.The government is partly to blame because they allowed these companies to sponsor a lot of people without doing background checks to see if they had enough work for everyone.So yes, the government should be held accountable.

aiming to recoup more than ZiG$500 million (US$18.53 million) in outstanding debts.\n\nThe operation will focus on Dzivarasekwa, the central business district (CBD), and nearby areas.According to officials, the unpaid billsaccumulated over five year, have severely disrupted essential services in the capital.Councils first move will be to cut off water supplies to all defaulting properties, after which they will be forcibly closed under public health laws.City of Harare spokesperson Stanley Gama said the municipality will be disconnecting water to the identified premises.We are disconnecting water supplies to all properties within the CBD and industrial areaa that owe the city for rates and services.Following this, our City Health Department will shut down these properties for operating without water, which violates the Public Health Act and the Harare Licensed Premises by-law, said Gama.Gama confirmed that tenants in council-rented premises owe over ZiG500million, stressing that inflation and prolonged non-payment have deepened the crisis.This has led to major revenue losses, partly due to the devaluation of money from the ZWL era, while the lack of payments has severely affected service delivery, he said.The crackdown could have severe consequences for small businesses, informal traders, and tuck shops operating in council properties.Many of these tenants sublease their spaces and now risk sudden closureeven though they are not directly liable for the debts owed to the municipality.While officials did not specify when the enforcement would start, they warned that all defaulters, regardless of how long they have occupied the properties, would face action.The council directly attributes years of unpaid bills to the citys crumbling infrastructure, including persistent water shortages, uncollected waste, and deteriorating roads.Recovering these funds, they insist, is vital to restoring basic services for Harares residents.\n\nThe
