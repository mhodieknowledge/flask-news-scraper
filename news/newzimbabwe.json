            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nLAWYER Fadzayi Mahere has won a US$100,000 defamation claim against journalist Edmund Kudzayi, whom she sued in 2022 after he accused her of dating a married businessman, Tinashe Murapata.\n\nKudzayi got in trouble over a story he published on his online platform Kukurigo, alleging that the top lawyer had caused the collapse of Murapatas marriage.\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Joel Mambara granted the order, ruling that Kudzayi should pay the claimed damages.\n\nWhereupon, after reading documents filed of record and hearing counsel, it is ordered that the plaintiffs claim be and is hereby granted.\n\nThe Defendant shall pay the Plaintiff the sum of US$100,000.00 or the equivalent thereof in local currency at the rate of exchange prevailing at the time of payment.\n\nThe Defendant shall pay interest on the above amount at the prescribed rate, namely 5% per annum from the date of service of summons to the date of payment.\n\nThe Defendant shall pay Plaintiffs costs of suit, ruled the judge.\n\nBefore mounting a lawsuit against the journalist, Mahere initially demanded a retraction, failing which she would sue for damages.\n\nHowever, Kudzayi insisted that there will be no retraction; the story is factual and much more is coming.\n\nMaheres lawyers consequently filed a defamation claim with the High Court.\n\nKudzayi said Mahere had an affair with Murapata, whose marriage has since collapsed because of the illicit affair.\n\nIn her declaration, in summons filed through her lawyers, Honey and Blanckenberg, Mahere said the allegations and publication by Kudzai were aimed at soiling her business image.\n\nThe article was designed to damage the plaintiffs personal and professional reputation, without any attempt at reporting information which was true or in the public interest. In the article itself, it was confirmed that neither the Plaintiff nor Mr. Murapata had confirmed any of the allegations set out in the article, and that efforts to contact the estranged wife were unsuccessful. It is therefore clear that the author of the article made no attempt to establish the veracity of his claims, and had no direct sources for the claims made, and was relying simply on the hearsay of third parties, read part of the summons.\n\nOn 3 July Kudzai published a tweet in which he threatened to produce Mahere story and pictures with a married man, 10AM tomorrow [4 July] (sic).\n\nThereafter, on 4 July 2022, in response to tweets from members of the public who expressed support for Mahere, Kudzai again tweeted, there is nothing honourable about having sex with married men and wrecking marriages.\n\nYou think chonaka because chaitwa neCCC? Munotopenga imi.\n\nMahere said it was clear from the context of the tweets that they were directed at Mahere.\n\nThereafter, on 5 July 2022, an article was published through the Kukurigo online WhatsApp platforms with the headline CCC spokesperson caught up in businessmans marriage collapse, love affair.\n\nThe article also stated that Mahere and Murapata had travelled together to a funeral in Masvingo and slept there under unclear circumstances.\n\nMahere then demanded a retraction but Kudzai said he was not going to do so.\n\nMahere said the Kukurigo website claims that 370,000 people read its news articles every day and claims 46,000 direct subscribers across 185 WhatsApp groups.\n\nShe said his Twitter page has 126,600 followers and since the articles were published, the untrue allegations have been reposted on social media and have been picked up by media sites, including Gambakwe Media, Zim News Online, Zimetro, iHarare.com, MyZimbabwe, Nehanda Radio, Pindula News, and Zimeye.\n\nThe reach of the defamatory allegations is therefore extensive. In light of the above, Plaintiff is entitled to damages as claimed, reads the summons.\n\n",

She was granted US$200 bail after spending three nights behind bars.\n\nThrough its lawyer Chris Mhike, AMH challenged placement on remand, arguing that the charge does not disclose an offence.\n\nMhike said in a democratic state, one cannot be arrested for expressing his or her opinion where there is freedom of the media and expression.\n\nThe arrest amounts to restrictions of the right of access to information.\n\nThe disregard of fundamental rights of the accused amount to violation of principle of democracy, he said.\n\nThe lawyer said when the company is placed on remand the state has restricted it from performing its duties to inform the public which is its mandate.\n\nJournalism is not a crime, by placing the company on remand means criminalisation of journalism.\n\nOne consenting to placement on remand means youre admitting to committing the offence, Mhike said.\n\nTakudzwa Jambawu representing the state said there is reasonable suspicion that an offence was committed.\n\nHe said it is not in dispute that Mnangagwa is the current SADC chairperson and the words contained in the article were insulting his authority.\n\nAccording to the state on June 7 2025 accused through the Zimbabwe Independent newspaper edition of 27 June 2025 to 3 July 2025 published an article titled When you become mafia state, intending to undermine the authority of the President by saying: In less than two months, our one year rotating chairmanship of SADC comes to an end and we hope it is not just Muckraker, who has not seen any value that our time in that important role has added to the regional bloc apart from just confirming the obvious fears that SADC is a mere trade union of dictators.\n\nIn the few months that we have been in that role, we have been implicated in the chaos that has rocked most neighbouring countries. We were implicated in the massive vote rigging in Mozambican elections-with proof that our people actually voted for Daniel Chapo in an election in whose disputed outcome resulted in the death of hundreds of people. We were also fingered in the elections in Botswana and Namibia, where our electoral rigging machinery was heavily deployed.\n\nWhen you have become a mafia state, and are known to arm fellow criminals from around the globe with your diplomatic passports, it has become very hard to stop your people from believing just anything.\n\nThere is certainly no doubt who is micro Managing this Chapo chap, so there is not even any need to wonder what our Owner thought when his boy was addressing a virtually empty stadium very soon the boy would have developed a thick skin, just hike his handler who no longer needs to do anything under the cover of the darkness. That is what happens when you become the head of a mafia state.  It is a government that came into power through a coup and is only obsessed with keeping itself in power hence the creation of demons such as the Tshabangus and the like, themselves creations of courts whose top judges are themselves appointed -and kept on  the bench via political chicanery, all to serve the purpose of keeping this criminal enterprise masquerading as a government in power.\n\nThe state alleges that the accused attached a photograph of President Emerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa and Mozambican President Daniel Chapo.\n\nThe state alleges the article was false in material and was designed to engender feelings of hostility by the citizens of Zimbabwe towards the President.\n\nHearing continues Friday.\n\n",

The European court in Strasbourg, France, said those issues were outside Switzerlands jurisdiction, although four of the 17 judges gave a partial dissent to the majority view.\n\nSemenyas case should now go back to the Swiss federal court in Lausanne. It will be watched closely by other sports which have passed or are reviewing their own rules on eligibility in womens events.\n\nSemenya laterposted on social mediaa photo of herself in the court chamber with a message a three raised fists symbolizing her fight for justice.\n\nToday, my patience in this journey has been rewarded with a result that will pave the way for all athletes human rights to be protected, she said in a statement.\n\nThe original case between Semenya and tracks governing body based in Monaco was about whether athletes like her  who have specific medical conditions, a typical male chromosome pattern and naturally high testosterone levels  should be allowed to compete freely in womens sports.\n\nThe European courts ruling does not overturn the World Athletics rules that effectively ended Semenyas career running the 800 meters after she won two Olympic and three world titles since emerging on the global stage as a teenager in 2009.\n\nThe judges also did not take up other aspects of the appeal filed by Semenya, who was in court to hear their judgment read. It awarded her 80,000 euros ($94,000) from the state of Switzerland in respect of costs and expenses.\n\nThe key legal point in Semenyas win was that the Swiss Federal Court had not carried out a rigorous judicial review. This was required because Semenya had no choice but to pursue her case through the CASs mandatory and exclusive jurisdiction. the Strasbourg judges ruled.\n\nGoverning bodies of sports oblige athletes and national federations to take their disputes to the sports court in the International Olympic Committees home city Lausanne.\n\nThe court considered, however, that the Federal Supreme Courts review had fallen short of that requirement, it said in a statement.\n\nIn dismissing other elements of the South African runners case, including if she had been discriminated against, the court judged it did not fall within Switzerlands jurisdiction in respect of those complaints.\n\nWorld Athletics, led by its president Sebastian Coe, has said its rules maintain fairness because Semenya has an unfair, male-like athletic advantage from her higher testosterone. Semenya argues her testosterone is a genetic gift.\n\nWorld Athletics and CAS did not immediately respond to the ruling. The IOC declined to comment on a case it is not directly involved in.\n\nThursdays win followed a legal victory from the same court two years ago for Semenya.\n\nThat judgment which said she had faced discrimination opened a way for the Swiss supreme court to reconsider its decision to dismiss her appeal against the CAS verdict in favor of World Athletics.\n\nAt CAS in 2019, three judges ruled 2-1 that discrimination against Semenya was necessary, reasonable and proportionate to maintain fairness in womens track events.\n\nWorld Athletics drew up its rules in 2018 forcing Semenya and other female athletes with Differences in Sex Development to suppress their testosterone to be eligible for international womens events.\n\nFour of the 17 judges filed a partial dissent to the majority opinion, arguing their court should have been able to pronounce on substantive conclusions reached by the CAS that went against Semenya.\n\nWorld Athletics eligibility rules specifically targeted the applicant, since they concerned only the events in which she competed  indeed, the fact that they amounted to a kind of lex Semenya clearly demonstrates the arbitrariness of those regulations as a whole, the four judges wrote.\n\nWe are disappointed that her expectations have not been met, said the dissenting judges, who included the chamber president, Marko Bonjak from Slovenia.\n\n",

            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nThe cost of constructing the recently commissioned Trabablas Interchange in Harare was beyond the US$88 million initially communicated and budgeted for, Treasury has revealed.\n\nThe Treasury confirmed in Parliament that the project cost a total of US$114 million  an increase of US$26 million.\n\nWhen questions were raised about the projects cost, the government was quick to attribute the increase to the relocation of families who had been settled close to the project site.\n\nExperts have, however, drawn comparisons with regional markets such as South Africa and Botswana, where constructing a similar project would typically cost around US$45 million.\n\nWhile many are still trying to make sense of the initial US$88 million figure, Finance Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube further shocked lawmakers by revealing during a Question and Answer session in Parliament on Wednesday that the project had actually consumed an additional US$26 million, not included in the original budget.\n\nEmakhandeni-Luveve MP Decent Bajila raised the issue in Parliament, requesting that Ncube clarify the full cost of the Trabablas Interchange.\n\nI asked the Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion to brief the House on the total cost of the Trabablas Interchange Project and to clarify whether the funding source was a loan from the private sector or the International Monetary Funds (IMFs) Special Drawing Rights facility, Bajila said.\n\nResponding, Ncube said: The cost of Trabablas Interchange was driven by our initial loan arrangement of the order of US$88 million, which was provided by the Consortium of Contractors. In terms of what we used from the Special Drawing Rights, we were required to pay a deposit of US$26 million. So, we used US$26 million from the SDRs to pay that deposit and then the rest was structured as a loan from that US$88 million arrangement.\n\nBajila followed up, asking whether the US$26 million was part of the US$88 million total, to which Ncube responded that it was not.\n\nThe US$26 million is in addition, but it was a requirement for accessing the US$88 million that we pay that deposit to access that facility. We think that was a very good arrangement indeed because we have been able to complete the piece of infrastructure, said Ncube.\n\nDangamvura Chikanga MP Prosper Mutseyami then pressed Ncube for an explanation on what had caused the additional US$26 million in project costs.\n\nMay the Hon. Minister explain to the House as to what caused the additional US$26 million, bearing in mind that the US$88 million had been budgeted to cover the whole construction of the interchange, he asked.\n\nNcube attributed the extra cost to the relocation of residents living near the construction site.\n\nThe cost of relocating, for example, relocating some of the residents that we relocated to create space, for developing this piece of infrastructure. There were some unexpected escalations of that cost, which then pushed us towards increasing the budget by another US$26 million that I have referred to, Ncube said.\n\nMutseyami was not satisfied and posed another follow-up question.\n\nCan you substantiate to the House as to how this supplementary US$26 million would just come about when the budget had already been sorted, then we have extra figures for the situation of adding US$26 million? How do you account that Hon. Minister?\n\nIn response, Ncube said the cost overruns were unforeseen and occurred during the implementation of the project.\n\nKwekwe Mbizo MP Corban Madzivanyika also challenged Ncube, reminding him that the original Trabablas Interchange budget presented to and approved by Parliament did not include the additional US$26 million. He questioned Ncubes authority to spend the extra funds without Parliamentary approval.\n\nMinister, you came and paid another additional US$26 million outside Parliament, where did you get that power to do such? Madzivanyika queried.\n\nHowever, Ncube insisted that, as Finance Minister, he is empowered to handle project budget overruns.\n\nOne did not have to come back to Parliament to be able to exercise the powers that Parliament and the Executive have already awarded or extended to me as Minister of Finance, he responded.\n\n",
