He was busted by the livestock owner, prompting him to flee the scene, but he had already been positively identified.\n\nA report was made to the police, leading to Musongwes arrest.\n\nIn a statement following sentencing, the National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) expressed worry over the rising trend of bestiality.\n\nCase of bestiality have been on the increase lately and it is the duty of the law to protect our animals from individuals with weird sexual desires, noted the NPAZ.\n\n",

Its a big problem that needs to get real attention, said Munetsi.\n\nWhile there are no official statistics on the number of players defrauded by bogus agents, FIFPro has intensified awareness campaigns across Africa to help players identify legitimate representation and avoid exploitation.\n\n",

We should have 22 companies patrolling our borders, but currently there are only 15. Even these face critical shortages of personnel, vehicles and modern surveillance tools like drones, he said.\n\nThis admission paints a bleak picture of a defence force stretched thin across vast and often inhospitable border terrain.\n\nThe SANDF highlighted further challenges, citing insufficient manpower to monitor the borders shared with Zimbabwe, Botswana and Mozambique. Soldiers are required to patrol hundreds of kilometres with limited resources, and the presence of informal settlements near the Limpopo River has complicated matters, with some residents allegedly assisting illegal crossings.\n\nDakota Legoete, chair of the PCDMV, was equally candid.\n\nIf we are being honest, we dont have functioning borders  and that puts the safety of our country at risk, he said. His comments were echoed by Mr Phiroane Phala, co-chair of the JSCOD, who emphasised the need to balance diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries and the imperative of national security. We cannot allow people to enter and leave the country without control, he said.\n\nCommittee members witnessed the dilapidated state of border fences and identified several areas where illegal crossings are rampant. Soldiers stationed in these zones shared their frustrations over the lack of numbers and support, saying they are unable to effectively monitor the largely unregulated movement of people.\n\nIn response, the committees have pledged to strengthen their oversight efforts.\n\nThey are advocating for increased funding, improved coordination between departments and modernised border infrastructure. They also plan to engage key stakeholders  including the Border Management Authority, the SANDF, the SAPS and SARS  to develop a more unified response to the crisis, with particular focus on the Beitbridge border post.\n\nThe visit comes at a pivotal moment in South Africas border control strategy, underlining the urgency of interdepartmental cooperation and renewed investment in national security infrastructure.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZanu PFs internal power struggles have escalated dramatically, with party spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa publicly rebuking Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, accusing him of turning the presidium into a kangaroo court.\n\nThe confrontation reportedly followed Chiwengas demand for President Emmerson Mnangagwa to take action against individuals named in a corruption dossier he presented to the Politburo.\n\nSources told NewZimbabwe.com tensions were high during the meeting. Chiwengas allies initially rallied behind him before retreating when questions were raised about the motives behind his dossier.\n\nThe document reportedly implicates several prominent businessmen closely associated with Mnangagwa, including Wicknell Chivayo, Delish Nguwaya, Kudakwashe Tagwirei, Pedzai Sakupwanya, and Paul Tungwarara.\n\nThe group is accused of siphoning millions from state coffers, calling for their immediate arrest,a move that has deepened divisions within the ruling party.\n\nOur Vice President decides to turn the Presidium into a kangaroo court. An inquisitive court.KutongaPresident citing that document which was authored by Kasukuwere and his colleagues, Mutsvangwa told journalists at a press briefing in Harare, Thursday, expressing his disapproval of Chiwengas actions.\n\nMutsvangwa claimed that everyone in the Politburo professed ignorance about the origins of the dossier, with the exception of Chiwengaleading to speculation that the Vice President is acting alone.\n\nHefurther suggested that the incident had served as a reminder to Chiwenga that he is merely a Presidential appointee and lacks independent powerandshould conduct himself accordingly.\n\nIt reminded the Presidium that you are appointees of the President like us. You have no powers as the Presidium. And it was one person among these Presidium members who was championing that document. All these other people were just being dragged along.\n\nThe Politburo asked who penned the document, do you accept the ownership individually? All other members of the Presidium said we dont know where it came from. So it zeroed in on the Vice President.\n\nChiwenga has consistentlyslammed corruption, describing it as a national security threat. He has also repeatedly warned those who amass wealth through unscrupulous means to watch their backs, suggesting that their day of reckoning is coming.\n\nThe individuals named in the dossier are alleged to be securing government tenders through corrupt practices. These allegations are not new, but their formal presentation within the Politburo has brought the issue to a head.\n\nFor instance, Chivayo previously defrauded ZESA of US$5 million in the Gwanda Solar Power project through his Intratek Company, and failed to deliver on the project.\n\nTagwirei has been linked to the over US$3 billion Command Agriculture scandal and is also implicated in the recent dossier alleging that approximately US$3.2 billion has been stolen from state coffers. Meanwhile, Paul Tungwarara secured a tender to drill 10,000 boreholes under the Presidential Borehole Drilling Scheme, but was recently criticised by Parliament for failing to deliver.\n\nThe government has acknowledged that it is losing US$2 billion annually due to corruption and illicit financial dealings, making the current accusations all the more damaging and increasing the pressure on Mnangagwa to take action.\n\n",
