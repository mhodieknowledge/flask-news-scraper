            "content": " says Parliament has received reports and proposes lifestyle audit\n\nBy Leopold Munhende\n\nTHE Chairperson of Parliaments Portfolio Committee on Budget, Finance, and Economic Development, Energy Mutodi has made sensational claims that Finance Ministry Permanent Secretary George Guvamatanga is getting kickbacks of as much as US$200,000 from government contractorsso asto facilitate payments.\n\nAccording to Mutodi, Parliament received complaints about how Guvamatanga has been managing affairs, and further alleged that he was demanding kickbacks from other ministries and government departments of between 5% and 10% for every treasury disbursement.\n\nMutodi claims Guvamatangas loot now exceeds US$1 billion and adds onto an empire that includes several mansions and 5,000 dairy cattle.\n\nThe Parliament of Zimbabwehas received agonising reports that Guvamatanga is receiving 5%-10% for every payment done by the Treasury. GG as he is notoriously called has accumulated more thanUS$1 billion becoming the richest civil servant, said Mutodi.\n\nContractors, Ministries and Departments refusing to pay Guvamatanga a kick back of at least 5% after receiving Treasury payments have been denied payments for several months even if the funds are budgeted for.\n\nOver the past six months, Parliament itself has struggled to operate after being denied its budgeted funds by George Guvamatanga. A civil servant earning less than $1000 GG has more than 5000 dairy cattle, dairy equipment and several mansions hence the proposed lifestyle audit.\n\nOnecontractor Bitumen which was contracted to do roads has been asked to pay US$200,000 byGuvamatangafor every $2,000,000 weekly payment he authorises that theyreceive and they have made several complaints tomembers of the Budget Committee at Parliament.\n\nGuvamatanga was earlier this year accused of receiving bribes from shadowy businessman Wicknel Chivayo to approve payments to the controversialRen-Form CC, a South African company that supplied Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) with voting material at highly inflated prices.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa is said to have fired and forgiven him in June this year before he begged for the job he has kept since 2018.\n\nAZanu PF Member of Parliament (MP) for Bikita South, Mutodiclaimed Guvamatanga had made threats to deal with him if the committee was to ever seek a lifestyle audit or engage the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC).\n\nHe added: Guvamatangahas also made threats to senda terror team to deal with the(me)upon hearing that the Committee was considering carrying out a life audit on him as well as asking for a ZACC probe.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nGovernment has announced that this years Presidential Pfumvudza/Intwasa inputs scheme will strictly target rural households, with no provision for the 500 000 urban or peri-urban dwellers who benefited last season.\n\nAgriculture Minister Anxious Masuka told Parliament during a Wednesday Q&A session that only rural communities will be provided with farming inputs under the programme, adding that last years inclusion of urban beneficiaries had been a temporary measure to cushion against the effects of the El Nio-induced drought.\n\nPumula MP Sichelesile Mahlangu had sought the governments position regarding urban constituencies benefiting from the scheme.\n\nThese peri-urban areas are actively participating in thePfumvudza/IntwasaProgramme and are fully prepared.What is the ministers position on these constituencies? Mahlangu.\n\nThe official policy is that urban areas will not receive Presidential input this year. The exception granted last year was due to an extraordinary drought, Masuka said.\n\nThis year, the inputs will be strictly allocated to the three million rural beneficiaries. Anyone residing in an urban area who wishes to benefit must be located in designated agricultural zones, namely, communal lands, A1 resettlement areas, or small-scale farming areas. These are the targeted zones for thePfumvudza/IntwasaProgramme this season.\n\nThe Pfumvudza/Intwasa scheme, a food security programme, has over the years focused on boosting productivity among smallholder and rural farmers through climate-smart agriculture.\n\nMasuka stressed that the programme would not accommodate urban dwellers since it is designed for farming regions.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that agriculture is designated for agricultural zones. Urban areas are primarily residential and do not accommodate farming activities.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, we have established that urban agriculture is not permitted, as farming should take place on land specifically allocated for agricultural purposes, not within urban settlements, Masuka explained.\n\nHe added, I recall that during last years severe drought, the President recognised that rural farmers who typically support urban populations were facing significant challenges. In response, we extended input support to peri-urban farmers to help supplement food production.\n\n",

            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nOutspoken former legislator Temba Mliswa has sensationally declared businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei as President Emmerson Mnangagwas natural successor, dismissing Vice President Constantino Chiwengas chances of ever taking over.\n\nIn a leaked audio of a phone conversation between Mliswa and controversial businessman Agrippa Bopela Masiyakurima, secretly recorded by the latter, Mliswa argued that Chiwenga is being misled by his wife, Miniyothabo Baloyi, into believing he still commands enough military influence to claim the presidency.\n\nMliswa, once a fierce critic of Tagwirei, defended his change of stance by insisting he has no permanent enemies but only permanent interests.\n\nThe person who is going to take over from Mnangagwa is someone he trusts, who will protect his interests, Tagwirei, said Mliswa.\n\nSocial media does not install a leader. To tell you the truth, I know how you feel about Mnangagwa but we cannot have permanent enemies, we should have permanent interests. Who does not eat, everyone is doing so.\n\nWalk with the father who is there, not a step-father. Chiwenga is a stepfather. We will lose deals because of things that do not matter, you are business people, you must look at things that make you money.\n\nBoth Masiyakurima and Mliswa appeared to agree on Tagwireis succession prospects, with Masiyakurima adding that he could never support Mnangagwa because of a failed US$5 million business deal between them.\n\nMliswa accused Chiwenga of corruption and pursuing personal vendettas, even over trivial issues such as unreceived wedding gifts.\n\nOnce considered the most powerful man in Zimbabwe after leading the November 2017 military intervention that toppled the late Robert Mugabe and ushered in Mnangagwa, Chiwenga is now widely viewed as having lost influence since retiring from the army to assume the role of deputy president.\n\nDespite perceptions that the military has shifted allegiance to the MnangagwaTagwirei faction within Zanu PF, Chiwenga reportedly still believes he retains significant sway.\n\nAdded Mliswa: There is no longer any opposition in Zanu PF, they are headed to a conference with Mnangagwa tightly holding onto power, there is no coup that will ever happen in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe cars that were given to the military came from Tagwirei with Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) Commander Phillip Valerio Sibanda saluting, remember Valerio is from ZIPRA, not ZANLA.\n\nChiwenga will never direct operations for the army, that will never happen. He removed his uniform. That man is being misled by his wife, he should remember that he no longer wears a uniform.\n\nBaloyi, a serving Colonel, has in recent months stepped up her public presence, which analysts view as part of both her own rebranding and that of the Chiwenga family. This comes as the Mnangagwa administration continues to face criticism over alleged corruption, ruthless tactics, and an expanding grip on key economic sectors such as mining.\n\n",
