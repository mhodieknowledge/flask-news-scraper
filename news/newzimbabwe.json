            "content": "BBC\n\nMore than 500 mpox patients have fled clinics in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo over the last month amid the current conflict.\n\nOfficials at Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), a leading health agency on the continent, have said they are worried as the missing patients risk spreading the highly contagious disease that is suspected to have killed at least 900 people in DR Congo last year.\n\nThe patients fled from facilities in Goma and Bukavu  two cities that descended into chaos as they were seized by the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels over the past weeks.\n\nWe were looted. We lost equipment. It was a disaster, Dr Samuel Muhindo, in charge of a clinic in Goma, told the BBC.\n\nMpox  formerly known as monkeypox  can cause symptoms such as lesions, headaches and fever.\n\nAccording to Africa CDC, since the start of this year almost 2,890 mpox cases and 180 deaths have been reported in the country, which has been at the epicentre of several recent outbreaks.\n\nDr Muhindo described how 128 patients had fled Gomas Mugunga health centre in the wake of the fighting at the end of January.\n\nHis health workers had not been able to trace them as paperwork at the clinic was destroyed, he said.\n\nAt Bisengimana, a hospital in Goma that also treats mpox, looters took medicines and personal protective equipment.\n\nFires were lit outside the centre and when the perpetrators departed, patients medical records were left strewn on the floor.\n\nNow we are afraid of an outbreak of the epidemic in the areas where the displaced people returned to Dr Samuel Muhindo Head of the Mugunga health facility in Goma\n\nThey were given72 hours to leave last week, although the M23 later said it was encouraging voluntary returns.\n\nNow we are afraid of an outbreak of the epidemic in the areas where the displaced people returned to, Dr Muhindo said.\n\nHis fears have been echoed by the Africa CDC.\n\nOnce again, we are calling really for the ceasefire and also the agency to establish a humanitarian corridor to facilitate the continuation of mpox interventions, Dr Ngashi Ngongo, Africa CDCs mpox incident manager, said on Thursday.\n\nBisengimana health workers Looters made away with iron sheets, medicine, gloves and masks at Bisengimana hospital as fires were lit outside the facility\n\nOver the last week, the Africa CDC says the number of missing mpox patients has risen by 100 as fighting escalates and the rebels take more territory.\n\nDr Ngongo added that a new variant of mpox with high potential for higher transmissibility had also been detected in DR Congo.\n\nThe countrys ability to respond to the disease has been hampered by the conflict, between the M23 and DR Congos army, as well as a lack of funding.\n\nThe mpox facility at Mugunga, funded by the UN childrens agency (Unicef) and BrItish government aid, managed to reopen last week.\n\nBut it is already so overstretched that there are times when four or five patients have to share one bed.\n\nSadiki Bichichi Aristide arrived at the Mugunga clinic a week ago after falling sick at camp for people displaced by the fighting\n\nI first fled from Minova to Goma when the M23 rebels began to advance from there, Sadiki Bichichi Aristide, a 23-year-old being treated at Mugunga along with two of his children, told the BBC.\n\nI began to fall sick in a [camp for displaced people]. It started with my fingers, and then I had lesions, which began to rupture on my hands. My neighbours told me to go to Mugunga with my children. I left my wife behind.\n\nHe said he had seen so many people with mpox before he arrived at the clinic last week.\n\nDr Oummani Rouafi, Unicefs Goma health specialist, told the BBC that the only reason Mugunga hospital had reopened was because staff had managed to hide some equipment and medicine from the looters.\n\nBut this had not been the case at many other treatment centres that had been completely ransacked, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Pisirayi Kwenda has ordered the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Service (ZPCS) to bring fraud-accused businessman Mike Chimombe before the court this afternoon, having initially skipped amid reports that he is not well.\n\nTrial in a case Chimombe is jointly charged with his colleague, Moses Mpofu, on allegations of swindling the state of US$7 million in a botched goats tender. The trial was scheduled to start at 1000 hours but Chimombe was in a show for the second time.\n\nLast week, the trial could not commence after the court was notified that Chimombe was sick and needed seven days to recuperate.\n\nKwenda had no kind words for the ZPCSand both parties after he only learnt that Chimombe was not in attendance after the court sat.\n\nFive months later, the trial has beenpostponedseveral timeson various grounds.\n\nProfessor Lovemore Madhuku, taking instructions from Ashiel Mugiya, who is representing Chimombe, asked for a postponement.\n\nMadhuku also placed the blame on the State for not letting the court know Chimombes whereabouts.\n\nHe has been unwell since last week. This matter was postponed last week in the hope that he will be able to stand trial but we are informed that he is still unwell and was advised to further rest starting from the 28th.\n\nMadhuku said he was relying on information he was told by Mpofu as well as Chimombes relatives.\n\nKwenda then ordered the prisons officer who was in charge at the High Court to bring Chimombe to court at 1400 hours or come before the court with a detailed formal report on why he cannot attend court.\n\nPCO Chikoto was grilled for failing to bring Chimombe and failing to update the state and defence on what was unfolding.\n\nDo I have to remind you that it is your responsibility to bring the accused to the court? This is your statutory obligation. Thats why you exist, fumed Kwenda, further asking the officer his suggestions on the way forward.\n\nChikoto said, Maybe the court should request him to appear.\n\nKwenda hit back. As court, we dont request prisons to bring an accused to court. Its an order, and I expected to see the accused in court as was ordered last week.\n\nChikoto suggested that Chimombe could appear this Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Kwenda said he will not tolerate that.\n\nIt is not up to you to keep him at prison if he is needed at court. You listen to court orders. He should be here at 2 pm; if not then you will explain, ordered the judge.\n\nMadhuku then informed Kwenda that his client and Mpofu had an appeal being heard at the Supreme court at the same time.\n\nThe prominent lawyer also explained that at law, two courts cannot sit to hear matters involving the same people at the same time.\n\nKwenda said he could not rescind his ruling.\n\nMadhuku insisted that the judge should reverse its ruling because it was handed down while he was not aware of the case being heard at the upper court.\n\nIf the courts want to see him for something else, he can be her, but if it is for trial ,he has to be represented in accordance with the law.again thats not allowed; this court can only sit with the accused as a trial court and nothing other than that.\n\nI think you have a room to correct your order, my Lord, Madhuku said, adding that all lawyers in the matter will be arguing their clients cases at the Supreme Court; as such, no one will be available at the High Court.\n\nKwenda said his court will sit even if the lawyers do not show up.\n\nIf you want to be at the Supreme Court, the court will sit and deal with the matter. Note that the court is always fair and aware of his rights to legal representation.\n\nHe also blamed the state and the lawyers for failing to inform him about Chimombes absence in advance.\n\nThe judge also expressed his disappointment on how the trial commencement has failed to start for five months, also suggesting that parties should consider if the case should still be live-streamed.\n\nWitnesses were also dewarned because of the uncertainty.\n\nThe judge said they should stay within the courts jurisdiction in case they will be called at short notice.\n\nThe ZPCS later brought Chimombe to court.\n\nHe looked sick and slept in the dock as the judge asked him how to proceed.\n\nI have nothing to say. Had already given my lawyer instructions, he responded.\n\nThe matter was then postponed to March 17 for trial commencement.\n\n",

In my view, they have no interest in the stability of Zimbabweans in South Africa, and the generations that will follow.\n\nThe majority black population in South Africa blames Zimbabweans for taking jobs, homes, medical services and economic opportunities, it says, adding that vigilant groups have been organised to harm, rob and even kill Zimbabweans, yet there has been no prosecution of the perpetrators.\n\nPhysically targeted\n\nXenophobia has been mainstreamed by political parties such as the Patriotic Alliance, MK Party and ActionSA, it adds, while quasi-militias operating as Operation Dudula and Put South Africa First have physically targeted foreigners, but more specifically Zimbabweans.\n\nThese attacks appear orchestrated and intensify during elections and national crises such as Covid and load shedding, it says.\n\nThe white minority blames Zanu-PF for ruining the Zimbabwean economy and forcing its citizens to flee to SA to avoid poverty, political persecution and maladministration, it adds.\n\nThe mainstream media, which they control, have successfully sold the South African population the idea that Zimbabwe is a failed state, which will never recover without them, and that it stands as an example of what could happen to South Africa if their interests are not protected, the memo adds.\n\nThe abuse of Zimbabweans in South Africa has caused significant psychological and emotional harm to all Zimbabweans in South Africa.\n\nIt is a matter that, in the view of many medical doctors and academics, cannot continue.\n\nThe memo also says Zimbabwean children in SA are being raised and conditioned to believe that they are second-class citizens. This is because their parents are humiliated, degraded, mistreated, and publicly scorned by what appears to be state-sponsored anti-Zimbabwe rhetoric.\n\nDiscrimination\n\nThe memo goes on to detail specific instances of discrimination that it claims have been happening, including:\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs (DHA) is accused of frustrating the rights of ZEP holders to apply for permanent residence, as allowed under the Immigration Act, even though they have lived, worked and paid taxes in SA for decades.\n\nThe DHAs decision to terminate the ZEP programme was found to be unlawful and unconstitutional in 2023 by the Gauteng High Court, which ordered the government to conduct public participation with the ZEP community.\n\nThe ZEP programme was then extended to the end of 2025, a deadline many of those applying forpermanent residence are unlikely to meet, argues Zepha.\n\nZEP holders are required to make online appointments with the visa processing company VFS, but many have received no appointment after four or more months of waiting.\n\nThis means their applications will not be processed before the expiry of the programme at the end of the year.\n\nNobody can reach their full potential in a toxic environment that is the reality for Zimbabweans in South Africa,concludes the Zepha appeal to the Zimbabwean ambassador.\n\nHistory has taught us that the return of significant numbers of the diaspora back to their country of origin, in various jurisdictions at various times, has led to economic development, transfer of skills, diversity of industry, and national pride.\n\n",

            "content": "By BBC\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a four-point plan to work with Ukraine to end the war and defend the country from Russia.\n\nThe UK, France and other countries will step up their efforts in a coalition of the willing and seek to involve the US in their support for Ukraine, he said.\n\nWe are at a crossroads in history today, Starmer said after a summit of 18 leaders  mostly from Europe and including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who said Ukraine felt strong support and the summit showed European unity at an extremely high level not seen for a long time.\n\nIt comes two days after a fiery exchange between the Ukrainian leader and US President Donald Trump in the White House.\n\nWe are all working together in Europe in order to find a basis for cooperation with America for a true peace and guaranteed security, Zelensky said after the summit.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference shortly after the meeting of leaders, Starmer said four points had been agreed: to keep military aid flowing into Ukraine, and to keep increasing the economic pressure on Russia, that any lasting peace must ensure Ukraines sovereignty and security and Ukraine must be present at any peace talks, and in the event of a peace deal, to boost Ukraines defensive capabilities to deter any future invasion. It also talks of developing a coalition of the willing to defend a deal in Ukraine and to guarantee peace afterwards.\n\nSir Keir also announced an additional 1.6bn ($2bn) of UK export finance to buy more than 5,000 air defence missiles. This comes on top of a 2.2bn loan to provide more military aid to Ukraine backed by profits from frozen Russian assets.\n\nWe have to learn from the mistakes of the past, we cannot accept a weak deal which Russia can breach with ease, instead any deal must be backed by strength, he said.\n\nThe prime minister did not state which countries had agreed to join this coalition of the willing, but said that those who had committed would intensify planning with real urgency.\n\nThe UK, he said, would back its commitment with boots on the ground, and planes in the air.\n\nEurope must do the heavy lifting, he said, before adding that the agreement would need US backing and had to include Russia, but that Moscow could not be allowed to dictate terms.\n\nLet me be clear, we agree with Trump on the urgent need for a durable peace. Now we need to deliver together, Sir Keir said.\n\nWhen asked if the US under Trump was an unreliable ally, he said: Nobody wanted to see what happened last Friday, but I do not accept that the US is an unreliable ally.\n\nCountries at the summit included France, Poland, Sweden, Turkey, Norway, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, Finland, Italy, Spain and Canada.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that there was now an urgent need to re-arm Europe.\n\nThese sentiments were echoed by Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, who said the meeting had seen European countries stepping up to make sure Ukraine has what it needs to stay in the fight as long as it has to continue.\n\nfter the summit, Zelensky went to Sandringham where he met King Charles III. He later spoke to reporters at a final press briefing where he said he was ready to sign a deal on minerals with the US.\n\nUkraine was expected to sign the deal  which would grant the US access to Ukraines rare mineral reserves  during Zelenskys visit to Washington, but the Ukrainian delegation ultimately left early after a heated confrontation with Trump in the Oval Office.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned a deal on minerals between the US and Ukraine could not be signed without a peace deal with Russia.\n\nBut when asked by the BBC about the future of the deal following the summit, Zelensky said it was ready to be signed.\n\nThe agreement thats on the table will be signed if the parties are ready, he said.\n\nSundays summit concludes a hectic week of diplomacy, which included visits to Washington by French President Emmanuel Macron, Sir Keir and Zelensky.\n\nZelenskys meeting, however, culminated in a heated exchanged with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance, in which the US president accused his Ukrainian counterpart of gambling with World War Three.\n\nTrump has said he wants to end the war in Ukraine and has expressed trust in Russian President Vladimir Putin, to the consternation of many of his Western allies.\n\nThe US has also begun peace talks with Russia  excluding Ukraine.\n\nAt one point, the US leader accused Ukraine of starting the war  even though it was Putin who launched a full-scale invasion of Russias neighbour on 24 February 2022.\n\n",

Efficient and seamless transport networks facilitate the movement of goods, services, and people, thereby fostering regional integration, he said.\n\nMhona pointed out that the development of the SADCs transport sector has been riddled with many challenges, including high costs of infrastructure investment to climate challenges that have caused a drastic deterioration of the regional transport network, particularly road, rail, and border infrastructure.\n\nThese challenges have caused delays at our borders, damages to property, and even fatalities in some instances. As ministers, we must prioritize investments in sustainable transport infrastructure, harmonize policies, and strengthen partnerships with the private sector to enhance connectivity across our region, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "By euronews\n\nSEAN Baker makes history as his Palme dOr winning film Anora sweeps the board by winning five Oscars including Best Film, Best Director and Best Actress.\n\nHeres everything you need to know about the award ceremony, with all the winners.\n\nThe 97th Academy Awards have delivered their verdict, and after an awards season race which has been truly chaotic and unpredictable, last years Palme dOr winner Anora reigned supreme.\n\nThe film won a total of five Oscars (out of six nominations) and beat other favourites like The Brutalist, Wicked and Emilia Prez to win Best Picture. And there was no white smoke for Conclave, which only went home with one Oscar  Best Adapted Screenplay.\n\nDirector Sean Baker, known for his bold, independent filmmaking, carved his name into the history books, as he personally picked up four Oscars  Best Picture, Best Director, Best Original Screenplay, and Best Editing  becoming the first person ever to take home four Oscars in one night for the same film.\n\nThe only other person to ever win four Oscars in a single evening was Walt Disney in 1952, but his wins were for separate projects.\n\nWhile accepting the award for Best Director, Baker let out his battle cry, encouraging people to support endangered independent cinemas and passionately expressing his love for the communal experience you dont get at home.\n\nPlease try to watch movies in the cinema, said Baker.\n\nAnora also won Best Actress for Mikey Madison, who beat frontrunner Demi Moore (The Substance). This was Madisons first nomination, and the 25-year-old becomes the ninth youngest woman to take the prize.\n\nIn Anora, she plays the titular sex worker who falls for the son of a Russian billionaire and in her speech, she paid tribute to sex workers  echoing similar comments Sean Baker made in Cannes when he won the Palme dOr.\n\nIn our review of Anora, we said: Madison, previously seen in Once Upon A Time In Hollywood and Scream, is a revelation here. She owns every single scene, nailing the Brooklyn accent and having an absolute blast with the spitfire insults. She gives a full-throttle performance that should propel her to A-list stardom  and at the very least to a Best Actress Oscar nom.\n\nBest Actor rightly went to Adrien Brody for his performance in Brady Corbets American epic The Brutalist, in which he plays architect and Holocaust survivor Lszl Tth. This is the second Oscar for Brody, after he won for his performance in 2002s The Pianist  becoming at the time the youngest ever winner of Best Actor at the age of 29.\n\nWith this win and by beating Timothe Chalamet (A Complete Unknown  which went home empty-handed), he remains the youngest performer ever to win Best Actor. Brody also becomes the first person to win the leading actor category with his first two nominations.\n\nIn our review of The Brutalist, we said: Adrien Brodys turn as a Holocaust survivor is both raw and fascinating in the way varying shades of tumult and passion intertwine at all times.\n\nOn the more predictable side of things, and as we foretold, Kieran Culkin won Best Supporting Actor for his role in A Real Pain  an open and shut case considering the actor has won the gong all awards season long in the precursor awards for his role as the carefree but damaged Benji. He shared a funny anecdote about how his wife (in attendance) promised to give him a fourth child if he ever won an Oscar. Lets get cracking, he told her as he walked off stage. Cute.\n\nZoe Saldaa won Best Supporting Actress for Emilia Prez. She had swept the precursors for her role as a singing, dancing lawyer who helps a Mexican cartel boss (Karla Sofa Gascn) transition to being a woman and disappear. No just / unjust controversy could drag down Saldaa, who gave a teary speech that earned her a standing ovation.\n\nI am a proud child of immigrant parents, she said, adding that she knows she will not be the last American of Dominican origin to win an Academy Award.\n\nThe evenings outcome shows that Emilia Prez and Netflix successfully shot themselves in the feet with the now-infamous tweet scandal, which has sadly dominated the awards campaign. Having emerged as head of the pack with 13 nominations this year, the narco-trans-musical leaves LA with only two Oscars.\n\nAs we predicted, Zoe Saldaa won Best Supporting Actress, and Clment Ducol and Camilles El Mal won Best Original Song.\n\nIt did not win Best International Feature, which went to Brazils Im Still Here  Walter Salles true story and moving cri du coeur about oppression in 70s Brazil. That loss for Emilia Prez showed that the fall from grace of Jacques Audiards film was complete  especially after Emilia Prezwon seven Csars (Frances Oscars) two days ago.\n\nThis follows a dubious pattern for Netflix films at the Oscars. Other recent films from the streaming juggernaut which were heavily nominated failed to follow through with many wins  see: The Irishman (zero Oscars for 10 nominations), Mank (two out of 10) and The Power of the Dog (one out of 12). For better or worse, Emilia Prez joins them.\n\nElsewhere, Latvian film Flow rightly won Best Animated Feature, beating favourite The Wild Robot and heavyweight Pixar production Inside Out 2.\n\nIts catnip for the soul, as Flow was one of our favourite films of 2024 and its win couldnt be more merited. Plus, a historic win, as its Latvias first Oscar.\n\nYour move, Estonia, quipped Conan.\n\nThe Substance, one of our favourite films of last year, only won one award: Best Make-up and Hairstyling. Its worth noting that Coralie Fargeats film is the first body horror to be nominated for Best Picture, and only the seventh horror overall  after The Exorcist, The Silence of the Lambs, Jaws, The Sixth Sense, Black Swan and Get Out.\n\nCheck out our interview with The Substance director Coralie Fargeat, who sadly did not go home with Best Director.\n\nThe ceremony opened with a film montage culminating in a We (Heart) LA sign, acknowledging the widespread devastation of the Los Angeles wildfires, which caused the Academy to twice extend their voting period and postpone the announcement of nominations.\n\nThis was followed by Somewhere Over The Rainbow sung by Ariana Grande, joined by Cynthia Erivo for a duet of Defying Gravity.\n\nComedian and late-night show host Conan OBrien presented the Oscars for the first time, and was introduced as hatching from Demi Moores back in a spoof of The Substance. A nice touch.\n\nHe wasted no time in getting a dig in at the Karla Sofa Gascn scandal (Karla, if youre tweeting about the ceremony, my name is Jimmy Kimmel), as well as a nod towards the AI scandal that attempted to plague The Brutalist (We havent used any AI, we just employ small children) and a joke about Amazons takeover of the James Bond franchise, announcing that the new 007 is Amazon senior executive Steven Belsky.\n\nConan did a great job, especially when it came to a serious moment dedicated to the unknown voices in cinema, those devoted to a craft () that has the power to unite.\n\nShame about a toe-curlingly naff bit featuring Adam Sandler dressed in a hoodie and shorts towards the end of the opening monologue. Conan also ended his opening with song and dance number featuring a pirouetting Deadpool and a Dune sandworm playing chopsticks on the piano. It wasnt great, but it was brief. So thats something.\n\nThe same could not be said about the entire ceremony, which did not zip by. The first four awards alone took about an hour to hand out. There were 23 awards in total and the whole ceremony lasted nearly four hours. Nothing needs to be this long.\n\nOne sketch about getting audiences back into theatres with Cinemastreams was great though, as was the throwaway moment at the halfway mark when Conan said it was about time that Kendrick Lamar showed up to tell Drake he was a paedophile. Conan did mention hes lawyered up  so hip-hops Certified Lawyer Boy can go to town.\n\nMemorable moments\n\nOne of the most political and powerful moments of the evening came when the excellent documentary No Other Land won Best Documentary. This deeply compassionate and powerful doc shows the collaboration between Palestinian and Israeli filmmakers to document the systematic Israeli destruction of Palestinian homes in the West Bank.\n\nThe filmmakers Basel Adra, Rachel Szor, Hamdan Ballal and Yuval Abraham accepted the award and called to end the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian people, in reference to Israels destruction of Gaza, and also called for Israeli hostages to be freed.\n\nWhy? Cant you see were intertwined? they added, noting that Israelis and Palestinians made the film together. They also criticised America for blocking the path to peace.\n\nIts worth noting that the West Bank-set documentary remains without US distribution, and the vast majority of Americans cannot view it. Even after No Other Land secured an Oscar nomination, no major US distributor bought the project. Lets hope that the US can find a spine and allow access to their audiences.\n\nElsewhere, Daryl Hannah came on stage to award Best Editing and started her speech with Salva Ukraini! A nice touch, as was The Brutalist star Guy Pearces Free Palestine dove shaped pin on his lapel.\n\nThe Rolling Stones Mick Jagger popped up to present the award for Best Original Song.\n\nBob Dylan didnt want to do it, because he said the best songs are in A Complete Unkown and that they needed to find someone younger to present the award So here I am, said the 81-year-old rocker.\n\nThere was an impressive James Bond tribute, presumably to mark the end of the Broccoli era and the (worrying) start of the Amazon tenure, now that the company has spent $1 billion on acquiring the franchise. Series stalwart leaders Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, who were in attendance, will be missed.\n\nClips of the 25 films were shown, as well as a dance number featuring Margaret Qualley  who would make a superb Bond woman, come to think of it. Lisa from Blackpink did a rendition of Live And Let Die, followed by Doja Cat doing Diamonds Are Forever and RAYE singing Skyfall.\n\nOf the three, were nominating RAYE as the next artist for a Bond theme tune. Hear that, Bezos???\n\nSadly, none of these musical numbers came anywhere close to last years Kenergy-filled Im Just Ken performance fronted by Ryan Gosling. Maybe he should be up for a Bond tune\n\nThere was also a moving tribute by Morgan Freeman to Gene Hackman.\n\nThis week our community lost a giant, Freeman said. And I lost a dear friend  Gene Hackman. I had the pleasure of working alongside Gene on two films: Unforgiven and Under Suspicion. () Gene told me, I dont think about legacy, I just hope people who remember me as someone who did good work. Gene, youll be remembered for that and so much more. Rest in peace my friend.\n\nThis tribute came before the In Memoriam section, featuring the greatly missed Maggie Smith, cinematographer Dick Pope, Roger Corman, Teri Garr, Bill Cobbs, Anouk Aime, James Earl Jones, Donald Sutherland, Shelley Duvall, and of course, David Lynch.\n\nHere is the full list of this years Oscar winners:\n\nOscar tallyAnora  5 OscarsThe Brutalist  3 OscarsEmilia Prez,

Expanding broadband and regional ICT connectivity is crucial for enhancing trade, communication, and service delivery across the region.\n\nStrengthening internet access, investing in fiber optic networks, and improving mobile connectivity will drive economic transformation and ensure digital inclusion, Mhona said.\n\nHe added that increased interconnectivity will foster innovation, facilitate e-commerce, and enhance access to critical services such as education and healthcare within the SADC region.\n\nMhona called for greater cooperation among SADC member states to increase investment in infrastructure development within the region, noting that the current boom in mineral and agricultural exports requires an efficient regional transport network system.\n\nThe SADC is a 16-member southern African regional bloc whose members include Angola, Botswana, the Comoros, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\n\n",
