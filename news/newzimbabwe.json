            "content": "LeedsTH\n\nRuvimbo Kaviya, aged 40, became the first person in the UK to have a tumour removed using a flexible tube and camera called an endoscope through her eye socket.\n\nRuvimbo, who received her diagnosis in 2023, had been experiencing persistent headaches for months, initially managed with pain relief. By February 2022, the pain had intensified, with spasm-like sensations that led her to believe she had a toothache. A visit to her dentist revealed no issues, prompting her to seek help at the emergency department at Leeds General Infirmary (LGI). After an MRI, she was diagnosed with meningiomas on the right side of the back of her brain and left side of her eye  pressing on the nerve surrounding her eye. It was in the area called cavernous sinus which is difficult to access and is considered somewhat inoperable.\n\nRuvimbo said: The diagnosis came as a shock. It was an incredibly stressful and overwhelming time. The pain was severe, and managing my medication was difficult. When I was told about the surgery, I stayed optimistic as the tumour was growing. Going ahead with the procedure was the best option for me.\n\nRuvimbo Kaviya, who became the first person in the UK to receive groundbreaking surgery to remove a tumour through her eye socket at Leeds General Infirmary. Credit: Danny Lawson/PA Wire\n\nThe procedure, carried out by Mr Asim Sheikh and Mr Jiten Parmar, represents a shift in how skull base tumours are treated. Unlike traditional surgery, which often requires big incisions, removing parts of the skull and involves extended recovery, this innovative technique is minimally invasive. Surgeons accessed the tumour through a small, 1.5cm incision on the side of Ruvimbos eyelid.\n\nI was amazed by the recovery, Ruvimbo said. I was only in the hospital for two days, with no side effects or swelling. I feel perfectly fine now. I am deeply grateful to Mr Sheikh, Mr Parmar, and the entire teamthey reassured me throughout the process.\n\nSkull base tumours are found at the base of the skull, and their removal has traditionally required an open craniotomy, a procedure involving significant trauma to the surrounding tissues and a lengthy recovery. The endoscopic trans-orbital approach offers a safer alternative with a faster healing process.\n\nCredit: Danny Lawson/PA Wire\n\nMr Asim Sheikh, Consultant Skullbase and Neurovascular Neurosurgeon at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust said: This technique allows us to remove tumours without opening the skull or having to retract or compress the brain. The minimally invasive nature of the procedure significantly reduces trauma, enabling patients to recover faster with minimal visible scarring.\n\nMr Jiten Parmar, Consultant in Maxillofacial Surgery at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust added, The ability to work collaboratively with maxillofacial and neurosurgical teams, using cutting-edge 3D planning, has been a game changer. This partnership allows us to precisely target the tumour, ensuring safer outcomes for patients.\n\nThe success of this surgery was underpinned by innovative 3D planning led by Lisa Ferrie, the Trusts Biomedical Engineer and 3D Planning Service Lead. The 3D model was used to perform steps of surgery on the life size model, prior to actual surgery taking place.\n\nWhen the surgical team approached me, we used scans of Ruvimbos brain and skull to create a 3D replica model, Lisa explained. This technology enabled the team to study her anatomy in detail and prepare for the procedure with unparalleled accuracy. Seeing the model and knowing it contributed to this groundbreaking surgery is incredibly rewarding.\n\nLeeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust continues to lead the way in medical innovation, combining advanced technology with world-class surgical expertise. The success of Ruvimbos surgery demonstrates the potential for this approach to transform the lives of patients with skull base tumours.\n\n",

The primary goal is to create a sustainable football ecosystem aligned with the National Development Strategy 1 and Vision 2030, Gore told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nHe added that there should be a stronger connection between the football governing body, schools, and academies. Currently, the player development pathway is fractured due to a lack of cooperation between academies, schools, and ZIFA.\n\nWe plan to invest heavily in grassroots football and revive junior structures through partnerships with schools and academies.\n\nThis includes implementing talent identification programs and establishing regional youth leagues to create a clear pipeline for the national teams, he said.\n\nGore also affirmed that the previous initiative of bringing in foreign-based players will not be abandoned, as it plays a crucial role in strengthening the national team.\n\nAbsolutely. Diaspora players have proven their value in strengthening our national team. We will continue to engage with the Diaspora to widen the talent pool, while also balancing it with the development of homegrown talent, he said.\n\n",

The objection was pointless.\n\nThe objection has no substance.\n\nHe said if ZIFAdecides not to take its disputes to court it does not mean that the High Court has no jurisdiction.\n\nIt is public knowledge that the court has dealt with many football cases in its history. It is shocking that ZIFA raised this point. If this objection was meant to test the watersthen the waters are still the same, Chitapi said.\n\nThe relief sought is setting aside the disqualification of the applicant.\n\nIt is my view that the applicant needs to be candid and take the court into his confidence.\n\nAt least this court should have an insight into matters the applicant needed the court to interrogate over his disqualification.\n\nChitapi said if this was done, his court had powers to review the committees decision and advise what was appropriate.\n\nIn casu the question remains, if the decision is set aside, what else other than that submitted before the committee would be placed before the committee to show that the applicant qualified.\n\nHe does not give any hint on what he intends to submit before the committee if the decision is set aside.\n\nThe point is this. He was disqualified in a process in which he impugns. He must show that this process was flawed.\n\nI accept that the minimum was a pass with five O Levels. What is correct is that OLevel involves a study of OLevel Curriculum.\n\nA requirement to have five OLevels must be met.\n\nJust for the avoidance of doubt, if one relies on a diploma, the issue is not that a Diploma is higher than OLevel. The applicant would be required to produce an OLevel certificate even if he holds a PhD.\n\nIn the present matter, the applicant has been coy in disclosing further information regarding his qualifications to correct the committees decision.\n\nChitapi said the court cannot simply set aside a decision when there is no supporting evidence to challenge that decision.\n\nThere was nothing grossly irregular in reaching the decision by the vetting committee accordingly, the challenge by the applicant cannot succeed.\n\nHis application is dismissed. Each party to be its costs.\n\n",

            "content": "By Nqoba MSibenke\n\nThe turnout of people seeking mental health services in Zimbabwe is generally low and in previous years this was attributed to few service providers this might not be the case now. There has been an increase in mental health awareness programs nationwide post-COVID due to the increased number of mental health issues. In this article, we will discuss the role of Psychologists in mental health and answer some critical questions which may help in debunking some myths concerning psychotherapy.\n\nAccording to the Health Professions Act 27:1,9, a Psychologist is a person who has trained and registered with the Allied Health Professions Council of Zimbabwe. In addition to registration, the individual should have a valid practising license. The general requirements for one to be registered as a Psychologist are a Bachelor of Science Honors Degree in Psychology and a Masters in Psychology with a specialization in the area they wish to practice in and completion of one years internship.\n\nThere are many divisions of Psychologists, in Zimbabwe the following are recognized, clinical, counselling, forensic, neuro, educational, occupational, community, child and research psychology. Psychologists are required to practice within their scope of registration. This means a Forensic Psychologist cannot practice as an Educational Psychologist or vice versa. The Psychology profession is regulated by the Allied Health Professions Council of Zimbabwe which in turn reports to the Health Professions Authority.\n\nWhat is the work of Psychologists?\n\nPsychologists perform assessment, diagnosis and intervention for mental health issues. The application of these duties differs across different divisions, for example, clinical practice deals with clients dealing with developmental issues, mental health issues, and psychopathology, and forensic practice involves the application of psychological interventions within the forensic setup. This involves clients who need assessments for legal issues.\n\nWhen should I seek the services of a Psychologist?\n\nIf youre struggling with emotional distress, mental health concerns, relationship issues, trauma, coping with change, self-esteem and confidence, addiction, academic or career concerns, sleep disturbances, or coping with chronic illness, consider seeking help from a psychologist. General practitioners may also refer you to a psychologist when they feel you require their services.\n\nMyths about Psychologists\n\nA common myth about Psychologists is that they read peoples minds. This is informed mostly by the media, especially movies. However, this is not true. Psychologists may infer what one is thinking based on an analysis of behavioural patterns.\n\nPsychologists are said to deal with crazy people. This is not true. This is not entirely true as psychologists deal with people who have a wide range of issues ranging from relationships to emotional as well as mental psychopathology.\n\nSome people believe that Psychologists fix people or fix their problems. This is a great undersight as Psychologists work with the client to identify their hopes and goals. They then work together with the client to achieve their goals. This is done through the aid of psychological therapies The focus is on empowering the client to be able to cope with their problems.\n\nWhats the difference between a Psychologist and a Counselor?\n\nPsychologists and counsellors share many similarities, but they also have some key differences. Both professionals work in the field of mental health, aiming to help individuals, couples, families, or groups cope with mental health issues. They employ various therapeutic techniques, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and humanistic therapy, to help clients manage their mental health. However, there are also significant differences between psychologists and counsellors. One key difference lies in their education and training. A key difference is that psychologists use psychological tests to assess and diagnose mental health issues. However, these professions are aligned and work closely together.\n\nWhere can I find a Psychologist?\n\nPsychologists can be found in private practice, mental health institutions like psychiatric hospitals as well as general hospitals. Remember that a Psychologist should possess both a registration and practising certificate to attend to you.\n\nNqoba Sibenke is a registered intern Counselling Psychologist and can be reached atnqoba.sibenke@icloud.com\n\n",

Haifeng defended himself out of instinct, grabbing the driver by the collar. The two were embroiled in a fistfight in which five other employees broke up. It was during the fistfight that Dube stabbed and seriously injured Haifeng on his left leg.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) is yet to comment on the matter which follows numerous other acts of abuse on locals by the Chinese.\n\nSection 27(b) of the Firearms Act criminalises pointing a firearm at any person or its discharge in public. The crime carries a two-year jail sentence, fine or both.\n\nLast year July, two Chinese nationals were deported after being recorded torturing a local whom they accused of stealing fuel.\n\nThe two hung him on an excavator as other workers looked on.\n\nAdded Ming Chang Sino-Africa Mining Investments: Our company is a law-abiding citizen and remains committed to best labour and business practices which employ legal conflict resolution strategies.\n\nWe are also committed to being a part of building Zimbabwe brick upon brick in the productive sectors and creating employment for thousands of Zimbabweans.\n\nZimbabwes exclusion from the international community, its worsening relationship with the West and an opaque Look East Policy have seen an influx of Chinese nationals who have taken up space in its mining sector mainly.\n\nCases of abuse are rampant with accusations of land degradation being swept under the carpet.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nHARARE City Council is facing a financial crisis due to its bloated workforce which exceeds 10,000 employees and includes numerous duplicate roles, ultimately shortchanging the ratepayers by hindering the delivery of basic services to the residents.\n\nThis was revealed Wednesday at the ongoing Commission of Inquiry which is probing the operations of Harare City Council from the period of 2017 to date.\n\nHarare City Council is burdened by thehigh costs of salaries which consume a large portionof the revenue that is generated by the municipality.\n\nInterestingly, the finance department at HCC employs more than 700 workers. Despitethislarge workforce, the financial system of HCC is in shambles.\n\nHCC Executive Assistant to the Town Clerk, Mathew Marara, admitted before the Commission,chaired by retired Justice Maphios Cheda, that the workforceis excessively large.\n\nEven 300 is bloated. Yes, the percentage that goes towardssalaries each month exceeds the limits that are prescribedby the government, said Marara.\n\nRELATED:\n\nHCC is plaguedby allegations of bad governance and maladministration failing to carry out its mandate.\n\nThe situation is further exacerbated by City Council officials and Councillors who are influencing recruitment, inflating the wage bill at the Town House.\n\nWhat happens is when you come up with the structures for the organisation, departments recommend the number of personnel and type of personnel they require.\n\nThey recommend these to the human capital department and the human capital department writes reports to the Council to recommenda change in the structure of the organisation. It is the Council which authorises the structure which will be implemented, said Marara.\n\nHCC currently has more than 70 drivers responsible for refuse collection, but most of them are idle due to a shortage of vehicles.\n\nMarara said the only solutionis to reduce the number of workers at the HCC.\n\nCouncil needs to undergo a restructuring exercise but this restructuring can not be undertaken by the current council because on a number of occasions we had recommended reduction in numbers but it has not happened. Definitely, the numbers need to be reduced, he said.\n\n",
