Response teams and local teams will work to find the people who may be infected and need to receive care, to ensure everyone is protected as quickly as possible,WHO added in a statement.\n\nDR Congo had a stockpile of treatments, including 2,000 doses of the Ervebo vaccine, effective to protect against this type of Ebola, the global health body said.\n\nThe last Ebola outbreak in DR Congo was three years ago, killing six people.\n\nAn outbreak in 2018-20 was far deadlier, claiming more than 2,000 lives.\n\nThe virus, which is thought to have originated in fruit bats, was first detected in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now DR Congo.\n\nPeople are infected when they have direct contact through broken skin, or the mouth and nose, with the blood, vomit, faeces or bodily fluids of someone with Ebola.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nEcoCash, Zimbabwes largest financial technology platform, says it is stepping up efforts to increase international remittance receipts by partnering with more global payment platforms.\n\nThe mobile money service, owned by Econet Wireless Zimbabwe, already partners with leading global remittance providers such as Sasai Money Transfer, Western Union, WorldRemit, MamaMoney, MoneyGram, Remitly, Shoprite Send and Terrapay.\n\nEcoCash currently has over 40 partners integrating into mobile wallets. The company revealed that it is currently in talks with additional international partners as part of its long-term strategy to build a truly global payments ecosystem.\n\nEfforts to onboard more payment partners are ongoing as we aim to establish a global platform that prioritises convenience, affordability and value for customers, EcoCash said last week at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Zimbabwe (ICAZ) Winter School 2025 and Investment Conference in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe high-profile gathering is positioning Zimbabwe as an emerging investment hub and showcasing the countrys deal pipeline, growth-ready sectors and capital opportunities.\n\nIt is also connecting institutional investors, global financiers and the diaspora with pathways to channel funds into productive ventures.\n\nThe initiative by EcoCash comes at a time when remittances are increasingly playing a vital role in Zimbabwes economy.\n\nAccording to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), diaspora remittances surpassed US$2 billion in 2024, making them one of the countrys largest and most stable sources of foreign currency.\n\nAnalysts say EcoCashs expanded global footprint is timely and strategic, enabling millions of Zimbabweans abroad to send money home faster, more securely, and at a lower cost. EcoCash zero-rates all remittance withdrawals  or cash-outs  from its wallets. It has an extensive distribution network of over 60,000 merchants and channel partners across the countrys rural and urban areas.\n\nIn 2024, EcoCash recorded a 21% growth in transaction volumes and a 210% surge in transaction values, driven by increased wallet funding and growing customer adoption.\n\nThe growth reflects consumer trust in the mobile money platform and the increasing importance of digital channels in cross-border money transfers.\n\nBeyond household support for essentials  such as food, school fees, healthcare, and housing  remittances are increasingly powering small business growth and community development projects, EcoCash said, noting that reliable and affordable digital payment services are enabling both rural and urban recipients to transact, save and invest without relying on costly cash-based methods.\n\nIndustry experts observe that strengthening formal remittance channels curb dependence on informal networks, improves financial inclusion and enhances consumer protection.\n\nWith Zimbabwes diaspora spread across South Africa, the UK, the US, Australia and beyond, EcoCashs expansion of its partner network offers more convenience and consolidates its market leadership in the mobile money space.\n\nAs we expand, our mission remains clear  to empower Zimbabweans abroad to conveniently support their loved ones with ease, while ensuring that recipients at home enjoy safe, transparent and seamless access to funds for both their everyday needs and future investments.\n\nRemitHope  a fintech-powered social enterprise that mobilises financial support for underfunded African-led community initiatives and leverages EcoCash to channel remittances into Africa to close the funding gaps  also participated at the ICAZ Winter School 2025 and Investment Conference in the UK.\n\n",
