The contractor was operating outside of ZETDCs jurisdiction and safety protocols, said the power utility.\n\nThe company urged the public to engage it directly for any electrical work involving its infrastructure so as to ensure compliance with safety standards.\n\nThe safety of our customers and the public remains our highest priority. We urge everyone to engage ZETDC for all electrical works on the electricity grid, added the statement.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nA major funding crisis is looming in Zimbabwes public health sector after the Ministry of Health and Child Care was directed by Treasury to cut its 2026 national budget bid, further threatening already-strained health services.\n\nPresenting the ministrys 2025 budget performance, priorities, and 2026 bids to a joint sitting of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Health and the Thematic Committee on Health, Permanent Secretary for Health, Aspect Maunganidze, revealed that Treasury had capped the 2026 allocation at just ZWL$24.19 billion, representing only 28% of the ministrys initial request.\n\nWe have been advised that our cap for allocation will be ZWL$24.19 billion. This speaks to about only 28%. If you recall our 2025 figures, we requested about ZWL$94 billion and got around ZWL$28 billion, roughly 30%. So, this years allocation is actually lower than that of 2025, Maunganidze said.\n\nOut of the ministrys four major programmes: Policy and Administration, Public Health, Curative Services and Biomedical Engineering, Science, Pharmaceuticals and Biopharmaceutical Protection, the total budget bid for 2026 stands at ZWL$85.3 billion.\n\nMaunganidze explained that the ministry made a ZWL$94.9 billion bid in 2024, but only received ZWL$28.3 billion, or 30% of its needs. This allocation, he said, remained well below the Abuja Declaration target, which recommends that at least 15% of national budgets be allocated to health.\n\nOver the years, our health budget allocation has ranged from as low as 9.82% in 2024 to between 12% and 25% in 20212023. The 2025 allocation of 13.01% was actually the highest in the last five years, said Maunganidze.\n\nOf the ZWL$27.2 billion allocated for 2025, the ministry had received ZWL$11.4 billion by September, just 41% of the total expected.\n\nThis is what we have received up to the end of September 2025. The question has always been, even though we received little, are we utilising it? Of that $11.4 billion, we have spent about $10.5 billion, representing 92% utilisation, the permanent secretary added.\n\nMaunganidze also warned that the countrys health financing landscape has worsened since 2020, partly due to reduced donor support.\n\nThis has resulted in the need for much more robust resource mobilisation. Its a challenge that has always been looming, but for sustainable health interventions, we must invest locally, he said.\n\nDespite the financial challenges, Maunganidze highlighted notable improvements, including increased life expectancy, achievement of HIV/AIDS targets and progress in human resource development.\n\nWe have seen a marked improvement in several health indicators despite the challenges. Our life expectancy has gone up; women still live longer than men, as usual. Our HIV/AIDS targets have been achieved, and we are continuing to upskill our health workforce, he said.\n\nHowever, the situation has been further compounded by significant cuts in U.S. funding, particularly from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). These programmes have historically supported Zimbabwes HIV, tuberculosis, and maternal health efforts.\n\nThe reduction in donor financing has widened the countrys health funding gap, putting essential services such as drug procurement, HIV prevention, and maternal care at greater risk.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Emelia Muchawa has sentenced Harare nurse Bridget Makaza to 27 years in prison for the cold-blooded murder of her husband, Kurai Bus company owner Macloud Zvavovaviri Mapanga, whom she shot three times as he slept in their Strathaven home in 2018.\n\nMakaza was last week convicted of what the court described as a calculated act of vengeance fuelled by jealousy, polygamy and deceit. Justice Muchawa said Makaza executed her husband and then staged a fake robbery to conceal the crime.\n\nThe accused unlawfully and with intent to kill, executed her husband while he slept, ruled Justice Muchawa. She aimed at the upper part of his body and delivered three fatal shots, then staged an armed robbery to cover her tracks.\n\nWhen handing down the sentence, the judge said:\n\nWhereupon, after reading documents filed of record and hearing counsel, it is ordered that the offender who was found guilty of murder as defined in section 47 (1) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act [Chapter 9:23] is hereby sentenced to 27 (twenty-seven) years imprisonment.\n\nThe court heard Makaza used a .38 Amadeo Rossi revolver with an erased serial number, smuggled from South Africa under the pretext of buying medication. After killing her husband, she screamed Thief! Thief! and falsely claimed robbers had stolen US$12,000.\n\nProsecutor B. Murevanhema said, There were no robbers. There was no break-in. The story was a fabrication to mask premeditated murder.\n\nPolice investigations confirmed there were no signs of forced entry. The firearm and gloves were later recovered from a swamp in Belvedere after Makaza led detectives to the spot.\n\nMakaza fled to South Africa after being granted bail and was re-arrested in December 2024 upon returning to Zimbabwe, claiming she missed her children.\n\nDuring the trial, she claimed self-defence, alleging her husband tried to attack her, but the judge dismissed this as a lame and incredible fabrication. Forensic expert Admire Mutizwa testified that the revolver required deliberate trigger pressure and could not have discharged accidentally.\n\nJustice Muchawa concluded that Makaza procured the weapon, waited for her husband to sleep, and executed him in cold blood.\n\nShe was methodical, the judge said. Her conduct before, during, and after the murder shows beyond doubt that this was a planned execution.\n\n",

Greediness knows no boundaries, and this will lead to a huge disaster for the country.\n\nEarlier this week,IOL reported that Zanu PF has emboldened its move to push through a proposal allowing Mnangagwa to remain in powerbeyond his current constitutional term, which ends in 2028. The party recently adopted a resolution at its annual conference backing the extension to align with the governments so-called Vision 2030 development agenda.\n\nKasukuwere, once a senior figure in the Zanu PF government led by Robert Mugabe before going into exile during the 2017 military intervention, became one of the most prominent former insiders to condemn the partys Mnangagwa plan publicly.\n\nZanu-PF party has announced plans to begin the process of extendingMnangagwas term of officeby two years  a move that, if successful, would keep him in power until 2030.\n\nThe proposal was formally endorsed at the partys annual national peoples conference in the eastern city of Mutare over the weekend. Delegates instructed government structures to start work on legislation to amend the constitution.\n\nAccording to State-ownedThe Herald, delegates argued that the extension would allow Mnangagwa to complete ongoing national development programmes aligned with the governments Vision 2030 agenda.\n\nThe conference adopted the resolution unanimously, describing it as a step toward ensuring policy continuity and consolidating the gains made under Mnangagwas leadership.\n\nZanu-PFs acting political commissar, Munyaradzi Machacha, toldThe Heraldthat the resolution formed part of the official conference outcomes and would be referred to the partys central committee for consideration.\n\nOur president has demonstrated exceptional leadership in driving national development. The conference agreed he should be supported to continue implementing Vision 2030, Machacha said.\n\n",
