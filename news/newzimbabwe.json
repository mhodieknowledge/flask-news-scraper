            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nSmall-scale miners have emerged as the key contributors to Zimbabwes gold production in the first half of 2025, accounting for the majority of the 24.32 tonnes of gold delivered during this period.\n\nAccording to the latest data, Fidelity Gold Refinery (FGR) received a total of 24.31 tonnes of gold, with small-scale and artisanal miners delivering a significant 17.76 tonnes, while large-scale producers contributed 6.55 tonnes.\n\nThis performance highlights the growing importance of small-scale and artisanal mining to Zimbabwes economy. Once banned, artisanal mining has now become a crucial part of the nations economic development, providing livelihoods for thousands and making up a substantial portion of the countrys gold output.\n\nGold production has been on a steady rise throughout the year. Between January and March, a total of 20.10 tonnes were delivered, with small-scale miners contributing 14.56 tonnes, compared to 5.54 tonnes from primary producers.\n\nThe surge in production comes amid strong global demand for gold, which saw the average price per ounce hit a record US$2,862.56 in the first quarter. Experts suggest that these high prices have incentivised miners to increase their output.\n\nThe highest production was recorded in July, when Zimbabwe saw its largest single-month gold intake of 2025. Small-scale miners delivered 3.20 tonnes of the 4.21 tonnes total, while large-scale producers contributed 1.01 tonnes.\n\nInternational gold prices have continued to climb, with spot gold recently surpassing US$3,400 per ounce, peaking at US$3,418.14. This surge has been fueled by softer-than-expected US labour data and growing expectations of policy easing.\n\nAdditionally, global economic uncertainties, such as trade tensions under US President Donald Trumps tariffs, have further solidified golds position as a safe-haven investment, driving up demand and boosting production worldwide.\n\n",

Defendant Priscilla Presley always wanted to the Queen. In fact, despite flaunting a public persona that only wanted to protect and keep her family together, Priscilla ultimately wanted one thing, power, no matter the cost.\n\nPriscilla Presleys attorney Marty Singer disputed the allegations in a two-page statement Thursday.\n\nThis is without a doubt, one of the most shameful, ridiculous, salacious and meritless lawsuits I have seen in my practice, Singer said in a 648-word statement.\n\nThese fabricated claims have absolutely no validity and we are confident this case will be dismissed.\n\nKruse, an auctioneer who specialized in Elvis sales, and Fialko, an Elvis memorabilia collector, said they had been collaborating with Priscilla Presley for years to leverage her name for maximum profits.\n\nBut once Kruse and Fialko got her back on stable financial footing in November 2023, they allege, she abruptly cut ties with them and denied themcompensation from themoviePriscilla.\n\nEarlier that year, the defendants daughter, Lisa Marie, died atage 54.\n\nLisa Marie had been ailing, but Priscilla insisted they attend a Golden Globes event together on Jan. 10 as Priscilla clasped to the spotlight, the lawsuit said.\n\nLisa Marie had collapsed at herhome days earlier and diedofsmall bowel obstruction, the medical examiners office ruled.\n\nPriscilla rushed to West Hills Hospital and despite Lisas clear directive to prolong her life, Priscilla pulled the plug within hours of Lisa being admitted, according to the lawsuit.\n\nPriscilla knew that Lisas death neutralized the threat of Lisas efforts to have Priscilla removed as the sole trustee of Lisas irrevocable life insurance trust and Priscilla ultimately wanted to control the Promenade Trust and Graceland. At her house the week following (before Lisas funeral), Priscilla exclaimed, Im the queen, Im in charge of Graceland. Kruse and Fialko were heartbroken by the unsettling behavior.\n\nSinger, Priscilla Presleys lawyer, said his clients granddaughter Riley Keough stands behind her grandmother 100%.\n\nKeough is equally disgusted with this latest, vicious attempt by Kruse to attempt to ruin her grandmothers life, Singer said.\n\nA rep forKeough, Lisa Maries daughter andPriscillas granddaughter, could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.\n\nElvis and Priscilla Presleywere married for six years and divorced in 1973, four years before Elvis died.\n\nPriscilla Presley is now 80, and Elvis was 42 when he died onAug. 16, 1977, at Graceland.\n\n",

            "content": "TRT Global\n\nCecil the lionwas the face of Zimbabwes Hwange National Park,had his own Wikipedia page, and a GPS collar tracked by Oxford researchers.\n\nTourists would fly to Zimbabwe just to photograph him. He was, in every possible way, the king of the pride.\n\nThen one evening in July 2015, a wealthy American trophy hunters bow and arrow ended it all.\n\nCecils killing blew up on social media, sparking protests from London to Los Angeles and turning him into the posthumous mascot of a campaign against trophy hunting.\n\nA decade on, lions and other wildlife continue to die the same way every year. Just that they dont make it to the headlines like Cecil did.\n\nAugust 10 marksWorld Lion Day, which Dr Angie Elwin, head of research at World Animal Protection, calls a stark reminder that the king of the jungle remains unprotected from commercial exploitation through trophy hunting and captive breeding.\n\nThere are over 8,000 lions in South Africas captive breeding sites, while only 3,500 roam in the wild according to IUCN. /Photo: Blood Lions\n\nProduction line\n\nThe growth of South Africas captive breeding industry over the past 30 years reflects how skewed conservation priorities have become.\n\nThe country now has nearly 8,000 lions in captivity, more than double the 3,500 in the wild.\n\nWorldwide, only about 20,000 lions remain outside of captive breeding centres, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nMost lion farms are pretty intensive production lines, Dr Louise de Waal, director of the conservation campaign Blood Lions, tells TRT Afrika.\n\nIn the wild, lioness gives birth once every two years. In captivity, she would potentially have four to five litters during the same period.\n\nCubs are separated from their mothers within days or weeks. Then, as Elwin points out, they are monetised at every stage of life: from cub petting attractions to walking with lions experiences.\n\nOnce too large to handle, a captive-bred lion is invariably sold as a target in a canned hunt, or commercialised killing of trophy animals within enclosed spaces, from where escape is impossible. Its a blood sport that represents the worst of human indulgences.\n\nEven death doesnt end the lions humiliating torment.\n\nSkins, skulls and paws become trophies, while bones may be dried, boxed, and sometimes illegally traded for use in the international big cat bone trade, Elwin tells TRT Afrika.\n\nHunters hang the heads and skins on their walls.\n\nBan only in name\n\nSouth Africa banned the legal export of lion skeletons in 2019, but a recent World Animal Protection investigation revealed that illegal trade continues.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2024, the CITES trade database shows that over 12,600 lion parts and products were exported globally  9,629 trophies, 943 claws, 670 skeletons, 486 skulls, 252 bones, skin, teeth, and other body parts.\n\nThis isnt conservation; its a supply chain built on animal suffering, with no benefit to wild populations and devastating consequences for the species welfare and dignity, says Elwin. Ending this cycle is critical to both protecting lions and safeguarding South Africas reputation as a global leader in ethical, wildlife-based tourism.\n\nCecil as a catalyst\n\nOn the positive side, Cecils death did change something.\n\nBased on available data, global trade in lion trophies has dropped by about a third since 2015, down to fewer than 1,000 in recent years.\n\nBut trophy hunting continues for elephants, rhinos, leopards, and other animals.\n\nConservationists in South Africa estimate that the proposed levy could generate over US$175 million annually. /Photo: World Animal Protection\n\nIn 2023, more than 6,000 international hunters killed over 34,000 animals, according to the Professional Hunters Association.\n\nThis is despite the fact that most local populations oppose trophy hunting. Communities living near South Africas Kruger National Park demand alternatives to killing animals for money despite having to deal with poverty, unemployment and wildlife that threatens their livestock and crops.\n\nFinding another way\n\nOver 85% of people we surveyed were in support of introducing a lion levy on international tourists, intended to replace trophy hunting revenue and directly benefit local communities, says Elwin, among those who contributed to the Lion Levy Research Paper.\n\nAbout 70% disagreed that hunting wild animals has always been part of our culture, and we should keep doing it.\n\nConservationists estimate that the levy, if introduced, could bring in over US $175 million annually, enough to replace all trophy hunting income in South Africa without scaring off tourists.\n\nThe lion levy has strong potential to improve local community livelihoods, Elwin tells TRT Afrika.\n\nCommunities near parks like Kruger have other options, too. They can sell traditional handicrafts to tourists, manage wildlife areas and guide eco-tours.\n\nCommunity-run lodges, campsites and guided tours would also attract responsible travellers seeking authentic nature experiences, Elwin says. This helps create jobs and raise revenue linked directly to wildlife preservation.\n\nCommunities around South Africas Kruger National Park prefer wildlife-friendly revenue as opposed to trophy hunting income which only benefits operators of the captive-breeding sites. /Photo: World Animal Protection.\n\nSome communities are trying out virtual safaris and wildlife webcams for international audiences, making money with minimal environmental impact. A few have leased out land to conservation groups, while others are part of biodiversity conservation campaigns that guarantee remuneration.\n\nBy embracing these diverse, wildlife-friendly livelihood options, communities can build sustainable economies that support conservation goals, reduce illegal hunting, and improve overall well-being, explains Elwin.\n\nFor now, its a race against time to shift from exploitation to preservation, before the roar of the wild potentially fades into silence.\n\n",
