We do not, in any way, want to see a Zimbabwe where the rights of the people are being eroded. In 2028, we expect to go to the polls.\n\nWe expect to have the opportunity to register our candidates and to elect a new president for Zimbabwe. That is our constitutional right, and we are urging those in ZANU PF to keep their factional disputes to themselves. Do not involve the nation, and do not disrespect our constitutional document. It is the right of citizens to choose their leaders, said Valerio.\n\nDespite Mnangagwa refusing to endorse the extension of his rule, his supporters have been rallying to push for the constitutional amendment.\n\nHe, however, has not publicly condemned the actions of this faction within ZANU PF.\n\nValerio warned that the country should not repeat the mistake of being drawn into ZANU PFs internal politics.\n\nIt is quite unfortunate that Zimbabwe keeps going down the same path. In 2017, we were presented with an opportunity for a new future. Now, we are hearing this new mantra saying we must keep the president in power because he is doing such a great job. This is why we are launching the Community Wall Initiative. We are covering the entire country because we want to put it on record: no one wants 2030.\n\nIf you speak to the people, there are hundreds gathered here today, and they will tell you clearly that they want something different every time they go to the polls. We are no longer interested in this. As UZA, we will ensure that the voice of the citizens is on record. We will not get involved in this factional fight, she said.\n\n",

Data also indicates that the informal sector has cost Zimbabwe at least US$1,15 billion in potential fiscal revenue between 2020 and 2023.\n\nUnder this framework, vendors will be licensed by local authorities in consultation with the Central Government.\n\nSpeaking at the post-cabinet briefing Tuesday, Information Minister Jenfan Muswere said, Under short-term measures, the use of electronic money will now be compulsory for all businesses and shall be achieved through the introduction of a compulsory tax payment system to ensure that every eligible taxpayer pays tax and the establishment of a Domestic Inter-agency Team to ensure informal sector compliance with tax laws.\n\nThe government seeks to bring all businesses into the tax bracket and enhance the effectiveness of the foreign exchange market.\n\nIn the long-term, the government will address the business environment to streamline fees, and charges and minimize duplication of work by Government Agencies as well as improve electricity supply in a bid to enable MSMEs to graduate into formal businesses.\n\nThe Cabinet also agreed to expedite the construction of power plants and upgrading of the distribution network to enhance the availability of electricity, incentivise the use of alternative energy sources, and expedite social protection coverage to the informal sector.\n\n",

We believe that this process is crucial for building Trust, honoring commitments and ensuring consistency with our Constitution as we address Zimbabwes debt challenge.\n\nThe payments towards the compensation of investors under BIPPA Protection began in the second week of January 2025.Payments is being made to the claimants bank accounts of choice, said Ncube.\n\nThe envoys of Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland jointly welcomed the announcement describing it as a giant step bringing a sense of closure among the affected parties.\n\nThe framework established by the Government of Zimbabwe leading to the full compensation of affected BIPPA farmers protected by BIPPA Agreements is indeed a historic achievement. We commend the governments allocation of funds in the National Budget as of 2024 to make the compensation a reality.\n\nSeveral affected investors have received initial payouts, and an emerging sense of closure exists.It marks a significant milestone and we consider it a very encouraging step towards a comprehensive and fair settlement for farmers and investors in Zimbabwe, the ambassadors said in a statement.\n\nThe President of the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the champion of the Zimbabwe Arrears clearance and Debt resolution, Dr Akinwumi Adesina hailed the milestone achievement and implored more development partners to support the initiative.\n\nThe compensation demonstrates the governments goodwill and commitment to building trust in the process and improving in the country. The progress Zimbabwe has made, the commitment and resilience it is showing, calls for support from development partners to facilitate the countrys efforts in implementing ongoing reforms and to provide the much-needed cushion to particularly the vulnerable members of the population, he said.\n\nIn 2022, the Government of Zimbabwe established a Structured Dialogue Platform with all its creditors and development partners to institutionalize engagement on economic and governance reforms to underpin the Arrears clearance and Debt Resolution Process.\n\n",

I have left party politics. I have handed over my resignation as a member and it is because where I want to go and contribute, I cant hold a single party membership.\n\nIn January the EFF announced Ndlozi had resigned from parliament.\n\nIm passionate about the upliftment of the levels of discourse in the country but most importantly I think the terrain of struggle that has been neglected over the years is the civil society space. Im interested in it because it is where you are able to cultivate and agitate the notions of freedom, where liberation is about the people, community development, research, advocacy.\n\nIts time somebody did for the people of this country what AfriForum is doing for the Afrikaners.\n\nNdlozis resignation from the EFF follows that of prominent members, including former deputy leader Floyd Shivambu, who left last year to join Jacob Zumas MK Party.\n\nNdlozi confirmed he was suspended after he was charged by the EFF on allegations of being part of the MK Partys infiltration strategy and not informing the leadership about Shivambus intention to leave the party.\n\nHe said he couldnt attend the conference of the EFF due to a dispute over his suspension, after being served with a suspension notice six weeks before the elective conference in December.\n\nHe said the suspension was unconventional in that it didnt rely on the code of conduct of the EFF.\n\nI was told to stay at home, cease my participation in parliament and the rest of the activities of the EFF. It was important for me because they said the investigation was still ongoing and when the investigation was finished I would be given an opportunity to respond to the allegations.\n\nI think we can agree these are dangerous and serious allegations. Later, the leadership argued the report would only be ready after conference and the matter has been referred to the leadership after the conference. It seemed fair for me to wait to clear my name so I did not function with a dark cloud over my head or a gun in my face.\n\nHe also confirmed he knew about Shivambus departure but believed it wasnt his place to inform the leadership.\n\nI knew about the departure of Floyd. He came to tell me of his consideration and I told him he would have to take the leadership into [his] confidence, and he did.\n\nThe idea that I should have run behind his back and informed other people or the leadership suggested Im an informant, a gossiper or a wedge driver. I am none of those.\n\nIt was Floyds decision; he had to communicate it. It was not my decision, he had to communicate it and he did.\n\nHe made it clear he never intended to join Zumas party.\n\nI never planned to join the MK Party, I still dont. I never worked with anybody in the MK Party in relation to some conspiracy about my departure. Whatever information they say they have was based largely on lies.\n\n",

The central bank was forced to swallow the bitter pill after intervening by unilaterallydeclaring a 43% devaluation rate in a bid to align with realistic market trends.\n\nHowever, inflationary rates published by the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (Zimstat) last month indicated that the countrys safe-haven, the US$ endured severe inflation blows after the year-on-year US$ inflation rate for January 2025 jumped to 14.6%, thereby gaining 12,1% from a rate of 2,5% in December 2024.\n\nAgainst the background, double-digit USD inflation under a highly dollarized environment is a cause for concern, as prices are generally expected to be stable in USD terms, the industry grouping inflation tracker said.\n\nRecords show that US$ inflation rate has been stable since January 2021 with current trends departing from the years long gains.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, US$ inflation is normally a response to ZWG inflation, as retailers adjust their prices in line with ZWG prices to avoid being accused by the RBZs Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for using the parallel market rates, the CZI analysis said.\n\nThe US$ month-on-month inflation began the year at a higher rate of about 11,5% for January 2025, which is an all-time high rate over the past four years.\n\n",
