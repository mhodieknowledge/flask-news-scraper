            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nA LEADING grain analysis organisation, Commodity Insight Africa (CIA), has predicted grain shortages for Zimbabwe within the next few weeks if government does not reopen borders to allow imports.\n\nGovernment, late last month, introduced a ban on maize imports by millers citing a bumper harvest, which CIA believes could have been inflated.The ban made through Statutory Instrument (SI) 87 of 2025, and announced by Agriculture Minister Anxious Masuka, declared that contractors would be expected to procure at least 40% of their annual raw materials locally by April next year and 100% of the materials by 2028.The SI also gives contractors the sole mandate to import, an issue that might not just put them on a collision course with millers but further worsen supply.The agriculture ministry has advised the president to open the borders for maize imports, said Jacques Pienaar of CIA.They were closed on June 1 based on their grain estimates.Speaking on Agriculture Intelligence Africa (AIA), a popular channel tracing trends in the grain market, Pienaar said the shortage would have been artificially created as government was being political about the decision.He added: It is a bit embarrassing to open the borders three months after closing them. It is politics delaying the opening of these borders, which in our opinion is inevitable.Government has the tendency to inflate growth estimates and the market warned several months ago that they were significantly overestimating the maize crop.Current supply is extremely tight and millers are already dipping into reserves. If borders are not opened within the next few weeks, millers could struggle to meet consumer maize meal demand.Whereas Pienaar estimates Zimbabwe needs an extra 1.1 million tonnes, the US Foreign Agricultural Services believes current supply will fall short by around 700,000 tonnes despite a notable increase in production.The 2024/25 season produced an estimated 1.3 million tonnes against a national demand of two million tonnes. Government maintains that farmers produced 2.3 million tonnes and ensured Zimbabwe will be food secure.WATCH:https://www.youtube.com/watch?si=wW5pyxHYB8qmYn76&v=CDgz1y_LweQ&feature=youtu.be\n\nGovernment, late last month, introduced a ban on maize imports by millers citing a bumper harvest, which CIA believes could have been inflated.\n\nThe ban made through Statutory Instrument (SI) 87 of 2025, and announced by Agriculture Minister Anxious Masuka, declared that contractors would be expected to procure at least 40% of their annual raw materials locally by April next year and 100% of the materials by 2028.The SI also gives contractors the sole mandate to import, an issue that might not just put them on a collision course with millers but further worsen supply.The agriculture ministry has advised the president to open the borders for maize imports, said Jacques Pienaar of CIA.They were closed on June 1 based on their grain estimates.Speaking on Agriculture Intelligence Africa (AIA), a popular channel tracing trends in the grain market, Pienaar said the shortage would have been artificially created as government was being political about the decision.He added: It is a bit embarrassing to open the borders three months after closing them.

Nehanda was to be the first to testify. However such does not debar a witness from testifying, he said.\n\nThe ruling is the latest twist in AFMs protracted legal wars, which have seen congregants, pastors, and church leaders locked in disputes over who controls the churchs lucrative assets.\n\n",

            "content": "University World News\n\nMost girls and young women in Zimbabwe dream big about pursuing a tertiary education. Still, their dreams are shattered by barriers that hold them back, according to the findings of a new survey conducted in 10 districts across the country by researchers from the World Bank and local research assistants.\n\nThesurvey, A Girl Can Dream: Analysing aspirations, gender norms, and influencers among girls and women in Zimbabwe, released on 25 August 2025, noted that 80% of girls in the country aspire to attain higher levels of education and eventually get jobs in the manufacturing, retail or healthcare sectors.\n\nHowever, only 4% eventually acquire a tertiary education, according to Dr Abhilasha Sahay, an economist at the World Banks gender group, and her associates, Sara Troiano, a senior economist at the World Banks Social Protection and Jobs Global Practice, and Sreelakshmi Papineni, an economist who focuses on gender issues at the Office of the Chief Economist Office (Africa region).\n\nOdds that include limited reproductive rights, traditional norms, domestic roles, acceptance of male authority, financial constraints and other indicators of poverty are invariably stacked against too many girls from an early age, the researchers state in the survey report.\n\nThe survey, which explored the aspirations and challenges faced by girls and young women aged 15-35, revealed that financial constraints were the primary obstacles: 80% of the respondents cited poverty as the main barrier to their pursuing higher education opportunities.\n\nAccording to the research team, this is consistent with the situation in most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Girls and young women are more likely to live in poverty than men and, characteristically, have less access to higher education and, subsequently, rarely benefit from productive economic opportunities.\n\nEarly-age risks\n\nDespite progressive views on gender equality as reflected in the countries legal systems, especially regarding education and reproductive rights, the researchers point out that traditional norms persist. This particularly happens in rural areas, where domestic roles, male-dominated careers, and acceptance of male authority still influence decisions that negatively impact girls access to higher education.\n\nCiting some of the early-age risks in Zimbabwe, the survey found that one in three girls is married before turning 18, and only 9% manage to complete upper secondary school. At the same time, teenage pregnancy is alarmingly common, with 111 births per 1,000 girls aged 15-19.\n\nThe risks are even greater for those with fewer resources, as adolescent birth rates are eight times higher among girls without a primary education and four times higher for those from the poorest households compared to their wealthier peers, according to the survey.\n\nOf the 1,291 adolescent girls and young women who participated in the survey, 40% aspired to complete at least a bachelor degree, but only 4% of them reached this level. Also, 47% expressed a desire to complete a university degree, whether a bachelor or postgraduate degree qualification if there were no constraints.\n\nAccording to the researchers, there was no significant difference in aspirations between rural and urban areas or across different age groups in all 10 districts, which included Epworth, Hopley, Beitbridge, Chinhoyi, Kwekwe, Murehwa, Mutasa, Redcliff, Umguza, and Zvimba. The high educational aspirations are noteworthy, especially considering the low level of secondary school completion among girls in Zimbabwe, compared to other countries in East and Southern Africa.\n\nBreaking male dominance?\n\nHowever, there are no indicators that girls and young women in Zimbabwe are prepared to break barriers related to venturing into male-dominated occupations in engineering, finance, and technology. Whereas only 10% of the respondents currently work in these male-dominated sectors, only 14% expressed a desire to transition into such sectors.\n\nInterestingly, the researchers noted that gender norms related to the acceptance of male authority still significantly influence decisions in Zimbabwe. Most girls and young women who have already made the transition to male-dominated careers have expressed a desire to return to female-dominated sectors, including production and manufacturing, retail, hospitality, and health.\n\nAccording to the researchers, an aspiration to work in production and manufacturing is a distinctive feature of Zimbabwean girls and young women (25%). In contrast, the sector has a lower preference in Zambia (12%) and Mozambique (7%). In Zambia, business services are a dream job for 25% of girls and young women, while in Mozambique, 32% aspire to work in education.\n\nIn their assessment, Sahay and her co-researchers argued that, whereas it is free for Zimbabwean girls and young women to dream about higher education, turning the dream into reality is a challenge. It comes with a price, often linked to tough decisions about education, employment, marriage, or fertility.\n\nAccording to the survey findings, 80% of the respondents were unable to achieve their desired level of education, and about six out of 10 young women were unable to find a job in their chosen sector.\n\nVoices from the field show a multitude of aspiration gaps. For instance, one young woman told the researchers: I did not complete my secondary education. I left school when I was in Form 3 at the age of 15, because I did not have the money for the fees. Going back to school for me will not be possible because I now have kids that need my care, and no one will take care of them.\n\nShe is a single parent and sells fruits and vegetables, the respondent said. She has not sought employment since she lacks the required qualifications.\n\nFear of social judgment\n\nAlthough the survey revealed that some traditional gatekeepers of social norms are slowly becoming more progressive, the researchers note that the fear of social judgment continues to discourage girls and young women in Zimbabwe from accessing higher education or pursuing higher-earning opportunities.\n\nFor instance, eight in 10 respondents in the survey believed that boys education should be prioritised over girls when resources are limited, irrespective of academic ability. Furthermore, although 86% of women in Zimbabwe are reported to agree that it is acceptable to delay marriage or childbearing to pursue higher education, 56% of the sample began childbearing before the age of 20.\n\nAbout 50% of the surveyed group agreed that a womans primary responsibility is household care, that men should be the sole financial providers, and that men should have the final say in decisions in the home. These regressive attitudes, according to the researchers, are common among girls and women in rural areas, creating additional barriers to their higher education ambitions and economic empowerment.\n\nHowever, there are indications that girls and women in Zimbabwe with more positive egalitarian attitudes and self-confidence were fuelling ambitions, as they tend to have higher educational aspirations.\n\nRespondents who rejected the idea that boys should receive more academic resources than girls had higher aspirations for university education. Likewise, self-confidence, as measured by self-efficacy and career decision-making process, is strongly linked to higher educational goals, stated the researchers.\n\nIn this regard, the new survey serves as a reminder that gender equality in accessing higher education and well-paying jobs remains a mirage, not only in Zimbabwe, but also in many countries in Africa. The issue is that, unlike their male counterparts, girls and young women on the continent continue to be influenced and impacted negatively by their social environment.\n\n",
