            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nMDC President Douglas Mwonzora has laid into businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei, describing him as one of the worst politicians who has unsuccessfully attempted to use money to get his way in Zanu PF.\n\nMwonzora was responding to donations and pledges made by Tagwirei in Epworth, where his party candidate Alice Nyahunzvi is set to battle Zanu PFs Civilised Bushe in a Ward 6 by-election on August 2.\n\nTagwirei, who has had quite a difficult month since being asked to leave a Central Committee meeting by Vice President Constantino Chiwengas allies, donated 15 solar-powered boreholes, two graders to rehabilitate the poor neighbourhoods roads, 100 primary school scholarships and 3,000 family food hampers.\n\nHarare province chairman Godwills Masimirembwa had endorsed Tagwirei to join Zanu PFs central committee, two months after the Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) senior member joined active politics.\n\nSpeaking to journalists on Wednesday, Mwonzora said Tagwireis use of money to lure supporters would fail the same way his cars and donations were failing to land him a seat in Zanu PFs powerful committee.\n\nHe said they had told residents of Epworth to eat his money and vote wisely.\n\nIn Epworth, our fight is no longer against the Zanu PF candidate only; it is a fight against thetenderpreneurs, commonly known aszvigananda, who are trying to use the Epworth election as a launchpad to get senior places in Zanu PF, said Mwonzora.\n\nThey are flaunting ill-gotten wealth, churning out false charity. The people of Epworth and Zimbabwe cannot be bought by trinkets.\n\nWe have said to the people of Epworth, eat their money and vote wisely. We are confident that we are going to defeat these bourgeoisie people who are flaunting their wealth.\n\nDespite being a long-time benefactor of the ruling party, Tagwirei has had his efforts to participate in Zanu PF politics resisted by senior members of the party, such as spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa and, reportedly, Chiwenga himself.\n\nTagwirei has been touted as Mnangagwas preferred successor ahead of Chiwenga while Mutsvangwa reportedly harbours presidential aspirations too. He has been referred to as the Prime Minister in circles closer to deals struck amongstzvigananda.\n\nAdded Mwonzora: Why was Tagwirei not doing it before? Why is he trying to promise us now?\n\nTagwirei has shown Zimbabwe that he has very bad political table manners. In fact, he is one of the most incompetent politicians I have ever seen.\n\nHe has tried to use money and cars to get into the central committee of his party and he has failed. He will try to use money and wealth in Epworth and he will equally fail.\n\nAccording to Mutsvangwa, Tagwirei promised Zanu PF politburo and central committee members top-of-the-range vehicles for unspecified reasons.\n\nThis, according to the former presidential advisor, was an attempt to bribe, gain favour and influence the decision on his co-option.\n\nZanu PF is targeting 8,000 votes at the Epworth polls, while the MDC believes it can easily upset its monied rivals.\n\n",

            "content": "By Privilege Musvanhiri, DW\n\nLawmakers from the ruling ZANU-PF party inZimbabweare moving a motion to further criminalize government critics.Theyre advocating for acomprehensive strategy to promote patriotism and national identity. Proposedmeasures includeformalizing a national ideology, establishing a national institute of ideology andintegrating patrioticeducation into the curriculum.\n\nThe motion comes on top ofthe contested Patriotic Act of 2023, which was seen toeffectively closed the door on dissent In Zimbabwe. It makes provision forcriticism issues such as provision of health care, basic services and accountability to be judged criminal.\n\nThe government dismissed criticism, saying the legislation was necessary to hold accountable individuals who threaten national interests. It said the legislation was modeled on the Logan Act in the US, which bars citizens from engaging in certain unauthorized communications with foreign governments. In Zimbabwe, violations could result in life imprisonment and death, termination of citizenship, suspension from voting or holding public office.\n\nIn a recent parliamentary debate, ZANU-PF MP Ophious Murambiwa suggested that it should be criminal to speak evilabout Zimbabwe.\n\nThe most important issue is to love our country, let us praise our country in all circumstances, whether in good or bad times, during the night or day, Murambiwa said.\n\nThe motion has prompted opposition lawmakers and human rights groups to pushback harder.\n\nPatriotism is not blind loyalty. It is not empty slogans. True patriots question injustice, challenge corruption and demand systems that serve people not a selected few, Prosper Mutseyami, an opposition MP, said.\n\nOur patriotism must ignite participation, ensuring that every Zimbabwean plays an active role in shaping the future.\n\nHuman rights activists say its another attempt to silence dissent.\n\nYou cannot necessarily legislate patriotism, Nigel Nyamutumbu, the Media Alliance of Zimbabwe programs manager, told DW. It is a concept that can naturally clamp down on the requisite freedoms. Patriotism is not a legal concept but rather a political nationalist ideology.\n\nActivists have in the past been accused of treason and unpatriotic behavior for expressing concerns over human rights abuses, corruption, and governance in Zimbabwe.\n\nCitizens have expressed concern overwhat they fear are attempts to enforce a one-party state. ZANU-PF, with its absolute majority in parliament, is seen to be abusing its authority and violating the constitution.\n\nAs parliamentarians we are supposed to uphold the constitution, Gladys Hlatshwayo an opposition MP told DW. Section 119 of the constitution demands that parliament protects the constitution and democratic governance.\n\nIn June 2025, Zimbabwes High Court struck down sections of the Patriotic Act.The court ruled that the drastic penalties prescribed by the Patriotic Act infringed on various sections of the countrys constitution.\n\nSeveral civic organizations and a private citizens had petitioned the court, arguing thatthe legislation was overly broad and vague and had high potential for abuse and misuse.\n\nThe most patriotic people are those who hold their government to account. A government must not be seen as the most dangerous institution, Eric Chisora, a political analyst, told DW. Whatever they [ZANU-PF lawmakers] are doing is unreasonable and irrational. Citizens rights must be protected.\n\nPolitical and civic rights activistsare calling for the repeal of colonial legacy laws which they say are retrogressive. Laws such as the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act, with provisions have been used to incriminate government critics, date back toZimbabwes pre-independence erawhen they were used to suppress Black majority rule.\n\nThe activists are concerned over the shrinking of democratic space under Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zimbabwes president since 2018.\n\nWe are now living in a country where there is no freedom of expression due to the number of pieces of legislation being passed by the ZANU-PF regime, Blessing Vava, executive director of the Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition, told DW.\n\nWhen you see a government passing repressive laws, just know that it is not a popular government. Zimbabweans must fight to defend the constitution.\n\n",

            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nORAL reports from senior politicians and journalists will tell you that in the 1990s, late liberation war hero Eddison Zvobgo once refused to come out of bed to welcome back late President Robert Mugabe, who was set to arrive in the wee hours of one winter morning at the then Harare International Airport from one of his many international trips.\n\nAlthough Zvobgo was never Mugabes deputy, it was common practice that a select number of Ministers, Vice President(s) would always welcome him back from these trips.\n\nVideos of high-ranking government officials lined up on one side with Mugabe shaking hands with each one of them, fresh from disembarking an Air Zimbabwe plane, are still etched in the memories of many.\n\nThe practice, interpreted as some power flexing opportunity by most Zimbabweans, has been explained by President Emmerson Mnangagwas spokesperson, George Charamba.\n\nMany would have wondered why Mugabe did not just disembark and head straight home, be it to his fancy Blue Roof or State House, when he arrived late or too early.\n\nApparently, it is protocol for an Acting President to send off and receive the President whenever they leave.\n\nWhoever would have been named Acting President has to physically be at the Presidents point of exit and entry for a tradition that had remained unknown, unasked and unexplained up until now.\n\nThe law of the land spells out who acts in place of the Head of State when he is away and out of the country for whatever reason. The Head of State is required by the same law to designate the person who stands in his place, said Charamba on X in response to questions around Chiwengas decision to welcome Mnangagwa late at night on his return from Equatorial Guinea, Japan and Algeria.\n\nThe person so designated is required to be at the point of exit, which is the port at which the extant Head of State leaves the country. So important is this procedure that the person designated has to be physically present, or else the Head of State may not leave the country.\n\nThe port of exit is that point where the sitting Head of State hands over instruments of power to the character chosen to act. This is why the Acting character actually gets saluted by the command, led by the Commander of Defence Forces (CDF), once the incumbent is airborne.\n\nFast forward to the Head of States return. Again, the Acting President must be at the port of re-entry to hand back the instruments of power temporarily given him in an acting capacity.\n\nHe appears together with the command and is the first one to greet the Head of State upon his return. In that welcome and handshake is the symbolic act of handing back power ceded temporarily to its elected owner.\n\nThe tradition, presumably adopted from Britain, has often been blasted as archaic, unnecessary and a waste of taxpayers money.\n\nExpectedly, it is practised in neighbouring Zambia, Malawi and Tanzania, all of which were British colonies.\n\nPresident Hakainde Hichilema of Zambia, his Malawian counterpart Lazarus Chakwera and TanzaniasSamia Suluhu Hassan all participate in the tradition.\n\nDesktop research on whether Britain was still practising it proved inconclusive.\n\n",

            "content": "By Julia Pierini & Kariuki Ndanganga\n\nIn our world of big names, curiously,our true heroes tend to be anonymous,goes a quote by the American historian Daniel Joseph Boorstin. Like these anonymous true heroes, wetlandsplay vital overlooked roles including provision of essential ecosystem services like flood control and water regulation,carbon sequestration, and climate regulation among others. Although they cover about 6% of the earths land surface area, they are home to about 40% of all plants and animal species, including birds which rely on these sites for breeding, feeding and resting during migration.\n\nFurther, these critical ecosystems support livelihoods of billions across the world. However, wetlands are disappearing at an alarming rate, world over. According to the just-released 2025 Global Wetland Outlook (GWO) Report, the world has lost about 22% of these critical ecosystems, equivalent to more than half a billion football pitches, since the 1970s. Various factors including pollution, agricultural and developments in addition to climate change are driving this loss. In the Sahel region, for example, Lake Chad, bordering Chad, Nigeria, Niger, and Cameroon has shrunk from 26,000 square kilometres in the 1960s, to less than 1500 square kilometres today.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, wetlands cover about 3% of the countrys area or about 11, 717 km2. Some key wetlands include Lake Chivero, Victoria Falls, Mana Pools, Cleveland Dam, and Driefontein Grasslands among others. However, more than 70% of these wetlands are degraded, due to various factors including urbanization. agriculture, mining, and pollution.\n\nProtecting and restoring wetlands andsecuring the livelihoods of communities that depend on these areas is paramount. This is why BirdLife International, the worlds largest Nature Partnership, is working in 27 countries across Africa to protect key habitats including wetlands. This approach is underpinned by identifying and protecting wetlands along key migratory bird flyways. Africa is home to key flyways including the African Eurasian Flyway, East Atlantic Flyway, major migration route for waterbirds, encompassing a network of wetlands across countries, which include Ramsar-listed Wetlands of International Importance. Through collaboration with national BirdLife Partners, efforts are focused on implementing national conservation strategies.\n\nAn example of this is in Asias East Asian Australasian Flyway stretching from Siberia and Alaska to New Zealand and Australia. BirdLife in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank and the East Asian Australasian Flyway Partnership Secretariat launched a $3-billion Regional Flyway Initiative in 2021. This initiative aims at the protection and restoration of more than 50 key wetlands sites along the Flyway which are important sites for millions of migratory birds, in addition to supporting livelihoods of millions of people through fisheries and agriculture, among others. Such models can be replicated across flyways, benefitting nature and people. Closer home, BirdLife Zimbabwe is working with local communities to protect the 201,194 hectares Driefontein Grasslands, home to 85% of Zimbabwes Wattled Crane population in addition to significant populations of the Endangered Grey Crowned Crane.\n\nFinancing is yet another critical component of wetlands conservation. According to the GWO Report, it is estimated that biodiversity conservation funding accounts for just 0.25% of global GDP, which is only approximately one-fifth of funds needed to address biodiversity loss, highlighting significant underinvestment. Consequently, there is need to increase investments in nature protection, including wetlands. Luckily, there are several innovative financing tools that can be leveraged. These include debt for nature swaps where debt relief can be provided in exchange for wetlands conservation commitments, green and blue bonds, carbon finance, Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes, and biodiversity credits among others.\n\nPartnerships and collaborations with various stakeholders is paramount for protecting these critical ecosystems. Local communities who are custodians of wetlands, should be empowered to identify and implement relevant solutions to conserve wetlands. Equally important, is the need for policies and regulations which protect wetlands. Like migratory birds, wetlands connect countries, and their conservation necessitates, co-operation across boundaries. From 23rd 31stJuly 2025, the world will convene in Zimbabwe for the Conference on Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar COP 15). This is an opportunity for policymakers to articulate and adopt resolutions to enhance the protection of these delicate ecosystems. Every action counts, and together, let us protect these anonymous heroes for present and future generations.\n\nJulia Pierini is the Chief Executive Officer, BirdLife Zimbabwe. Kariuki Ndangnga is the Regional Director for Africa, BirdLife International.\n\n",

One resident said that 12 bodies had been found but Barack said no bodies had been recovered.\n\nThe area, in South Kivu province, has been under the control of M23 rebels since they captured swathes of DR Congos mineral-rich east earlier this year. The M23 rejected reports that hundreds were trapped underground.\n\nLomera has witnessed a gold rush since the end of last year when the precious ore was discovered in the hills near what was then a quiet village, according to medical charity MSF.\n\nThousands of people arrived hoping to make money as freelance, or artisanal, miners, turning the area into a sprawling chaos of mineshafts and makeshift shelters, MSF said in a statement on a cholera outbreak in the area last month.\n\nReports said a series of cascading landslides buried up to 15 of these makeshift shafts without warning.\n\nRescue efforts have slowed as debris and large stones continue to block access.\n\nJournalist Barack told the BBC that the lack of proper equipment has hampered attempts to clear the site. Survivors told him that many miners remain stuck.\n\nWeve been digging since Sunday night but have not recovered any bodies. We are exhausted, one miner said.\n\nOfficials from M23 visited the site and ordered mining activities to stop in parts of the area.\n\nDozens of mining sites across this region of DR Congo supply the global electronics industry with vital metals and minerals.
