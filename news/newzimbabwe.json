            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Constitutional Court has struck down the University of Zimbabwes (UZ) appeal in a long-running labour dispute with former bursar Vengai Mugabe, declaring prior court proceedings a nullity in every sense.\n\nDelivering the judgment, Justice Anne-Mary Gowora ruled that both the Labour Court and the Supreme Court acted without proper jurisdiction.\n\nIt has been made clear that there must be compliance with statutory requirements in order for the court to assert jurisdiction over matters, she said. The lack of adherence to these procedural safeguards rendered the previous judgments ineffective and void.\n\nMugabe, appointed bursar on a fixed-term contract from July 2017 to June 2021, was dismissed following clashes with university management. A labour officer later awarded him US$323,036 for unfair dismissal, a ruling UZ unsuccessfully appealed.\n\nRepresenting Mugabe, attorney Tawanda Zhuwarara said the earlier rulings violated fundamental rights enshrined in sections 56 and 71 of the Constitution, adding that the Supreme Courts decision was an arbitrary deprivation of property.\n\nUZs lawyer, G. Madzoka, countered that the application was nothing more than a disguised appeal, arguing that the underlying issues had already been settled.\n\nJustice Rita Makarau noted the unacceptable failure by lower courts to address preliminary points vital to fairness.\n\nDeclaring both earlier rulings void, the Court found the proceedings fraught with irregularities.\n\n",

            "content": "Music in Africa\n\nTheZimbabwe Musicians Union(ZIMU) has called for an immediate review of the 2024 audit report of theZimbabwe Music Rights Association(ZIMURA), citing alleged governance failures, misrepresentation, and breaches of corporate protocol.\n\nIn an open letter dated 19 October 2025 addressed to Baker Tilly Chartered Accountants, ZIMURAs auditors, ZIMU presidentEdith Katijiaccused the firm of overlooking several procedural and ethical irregularities in its audit of the music rights body. The letter was also copied to the Companies and Intellectual Property Office (CIPZ), the Ministry of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture, and the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ).\n\nQuestions over audit validity\n\nKatiji claimed that ZIMURAs 2024 audited financial statements failed to comply with the organisations Articles of Association. She said the report was signed by only two individuals, board chairpersonAlbert Nyathiand executive director Polisile Ncube-Chimhini, without the mandatory third signature from the company secretary. According to Section 59 of the Articles of Association, the company seal must be accompanied by two directors signatures and that of the secretary.\n\nZIMU further argued that the document was invalid because Ncube-Chimhini allegedly signed under a title that does not exist in ZIMURAs governance structure. The letter cited a High Court ruling in Farai Fred Nyakudanga v Polisile Ncube-Chimhini (HH 438-25), which found that she does not hold the position of executive director.\n\nAlleged omission of material facts\n\nKatiji criticised the auditors for failing to disclose Ncube-Chimhinis reported fraud conviction, while noting that the audit made reference to unrelated legal cases such as Simbisa Brands Zimbabwe (Pvt) Ltd. She said the omission of information about the conviction undermined the integrity and transparency of the report.\n\nWhile every citizen has the right to appeal, the conviction stands until overturned, Katiji wrote. Responsible governance demands immediate suspension, not concealment or legitimisation.\n\nThe musicians body alleged that ZIMURA continues to face multiple governance and legal challenges, including police investigations into fraud and misappropriation of funds, as well as ongoing court cases involving board members. ZIMU said the auditors failure to reference these matters amounted to a serious breach of professional responsibility.\n\nThe letter also raised concerns about the accuracy of the directors list in the audit report, stating that it did not match official records lodged with the Deeds Office. It named Philip Chipfumbu as one of the directors omitted from the published list.\n\nAuditor independence questioned\n\nZIMU questioned Baker Tillys professional conduct, suggesting that the firm may have relied on information supplied by ZIMURAs management without independent verification. The union said the audit created confusion by alternately assigning responsibility for financial statements to both management and the board, which contradicts ZIMURAs Articles of Association.\n\nKatiji urged the audit firm to withhold the report from presentation at ZIMURAs Annual General Meeting (AGM) scheduled for 22 October 2025, warning that using the document to guide governance decisions would be reckless and a breach of ethical responsibilities.\n\nZIMU has requested an urgent reassessment of the 2024 audit, public disclosure of Ncube-Chimhinis legal status, and cooperation with regulatory authorities to restore transparency. The union also called for scrutiny of ZIMURAs legal adviser, Witness Zhangazha, who has reportedly been referred to the Law Society of Zimbabwe over alleged misconduct.\n\nKatiji said the credibility of both ZIMURA and Zimbabwes audit profession was at stake if the issues were not addressed.\n\nNeither ZIMURA nor Baker Tilly had issued a public response to the letter at the time of publication.\n\n",

It does not end when the doors close; rather its an ecosystem that connects communities through their stories, said the founder.\n\nThe first edition of the conference saw more than 130 participants from across Africa and the diaspora.\n\nAfrotellers has grown into a continental movement connecting artists, activists and thinkers through community storytelling hubs in Malawi, South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, DR Congo, Lesotho and Zimbabwe.\n\nFrom village gatherings to urban collectives, we are seeing a shared language of resistance, creativity and care emerging across Africa, Chivhanga said.\n\nThis years edition will build on the foundation that was laid in the previous year by exploring storytelling as infrastructure  shaping how Africans imagine themselves, relate to one another and influence how the continent is perceived globally.\n\nSome of the speakers for this years Afrotellers include playwright and scholar Dr Refiloe Lepere, Zimbabwean political organiser Gift Ostallos Siziba, visual activist Prof. Sir Zanele Muholi, Ugandan philanthropy leader Jackie Asiimwe, playwright and director Monageng Vice Motshabi and photographer Andrew Tshabangu.\n\n",
