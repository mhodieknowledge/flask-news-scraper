Geza says the protests should be sustained until Mnangagwa resigns.\n\nIn response to Gezas incitement, the PSC said its workers, who fail to report for duty, would be deemed saboteurs.\n\nThe PSC notes with concern recent incitements circulating in various platforms encouraging public servants and other citizens to stay away from work or abstain from regular activities on 22 and 23 April 2025.\n\nThe Commission is confident that public servants, who are committed, disciplined, and fully aware of their responsibilities, will not be misled by such reckless and disruptive incitements, PSC said in a statement.\n\nPublic servants are reminded that their core mandate is to serve the people of Zimbabwe faithfully, diligently, and without interruption. The work carried out by the Public Service is vital to the delivery of essential services and the advancement of our national development aspirations, as outlined in Vision 2030.\n\nThe government workers were also reminded that participating in the stay-away would be considered an act of insubordination.\n\nParticipation in any stay-away that disrupts service delivery constitutes a dereliction of duty and an act of insubordination. Such actions are unpatriotic, undermine national unity, damage the economy, and hinder the collective progress of the nation. The PSC will not tolerate any conduct that threatens the stability and functionality of public institutions, added the PSC.\n\nAccordingly, the PSC wishes to clarify that Tuesday, 22 April 2025, and Wednesday, 23 April 2025, are normal working days.\n\nSupervisors were urged to mark attendance registers of all government employees and inspectors will collect the registers at all ministries, departments and agencies.\n\nPSC said it expects its workers to be at their workstations and discharge normal duties professionally, thereby displaying their loyalty to the incumbent leadership.\n\nTogether, let us uphold the dignity of the Public Service and contribute meaningfully towards building a prosperous, resilient, and united Zimbabwe, the PSC statement further reads.\n\n",

            "content": "SowetanLive\n\nA man has been arrested at the Beitbridge border post for aiding undocumented migrants cross into South Africa for just R300.\n\nThe Border Management Authority (BMA) on Monday said the man from SA was caught by drone surveillance and intercepted by its officials while attempting to exit the patrol zone in Musina, Limpopo, with two undocumented people.\n\nThe area the man dubbed as a facilitator operates from was in a carport just 500m opposite the port.\n\nOfficials said another facilitator who fled the scene was seen conversing with a migrant before cash was exchanged between the two through a red gate.\n\nBMA commissioner Michael Masiapato said they had intensified their efforts to identify and arrest facilitators at border posts.\n\nHe said facilitators charge undocumented foreigners between R300 and R350 to get across the border.\n\nWhat we are doing seriously now is identifying and arresting the facilitators. These individuals arent deported  instead, theyre taken to the police station in Musina and charged for aiding and abetting, he said.\n\nSpeaking at the command site where the drones were being operated from, Masiapato said:It is great to capture the groups of [undocumented] people but they are not the ones organising this [illegal crossing].\n\nWe need to get the people who organise for these people being transported into the country, the people who are pulling the ropes, like we did in Lebombo [border in Komatipoort, Mpumalanga].\n\nWe let these people cross the river and then follow them until we get to the facilitator.\n\nMasiapato said they had let a group of undocumented migrants travel into the country at Lebombo andlater arrested them and the taxi driver who had met them halfway past the border.\n\nEven if we dont get them all, and two or three escape, as long as we can get the facilitator, that cuts their operation much shorter, Masiapato said.\n\nThe arrest of the man at Beitbridge came as officials were monitoring a makeshift boat with several passengers in the Limpopo River.\n\nWhen it comes to illegal migration at Beitbridge, this [using makeshift boats] is a common pattern. People are put into makeshift boats and ferried across the Limpopo River. We keep destroying those boats, but they keep rebuilding them.\n\nWe cant act while theyre still on the Zimbabwean side or even entering the river, but once theyre on our side, thats when we can act and arrest them, he said.\n\nDrone surveillance footage Sowetan has seen shows two people pulling a group of 15 people to the Limpopo River banks on the SA side.\n\nThe group then scattered shortly afterwards. However, BMA officials followed some who were going to meet another facilitator.\n\nOur border guards intercepted the group we saw today in the bush, and as we speak, they are being processed for deportation.\n\nMasiapato said 1,000 undocumented people have been arrested and deported since Tuesday, leading up to the Easter holidays.\n\nWeve processed just about 89,000 people since Tuesday last week. Now, from yesterday [Sunday] until today, were officially in the return leg, he said.\n\nDrone operator Thato Motloung said:The drone is the eyes in the sky. It helps the officials know from which positions foreigners are coming from.\n\nIt has features like obstacle detection and movement detection, something you might miss with a naked eye, like someone hiding under a truck or even in the river, thats how we detected the body of the person who was eaten by a crocodile [in the Limpopo River] on Sunday, Motloung said.\n\nLea Petersen, business enablement projects coordinator forArmaments Corporation of SA, said the technology being used by the BMA has really helped the officials work to the fullest ability, improving public behaviour.\n\nThe drones have been used once again, its been so inspirational to see how the drones using artificial intelligence and providing an eye in the sky help the BMA to do targeted arrests and targeted operations, said Petersen.\n\n",

            "content": "The Guardian\n\nPredicting the outcome of thehighly secretive papal conclaveis near impossible as cardinals positions shift over successive votes and some try to game the system to influence the chances of their favoured  or least-favoured  candidates. In the last conclave in 2013, few predicted that Jorge Mario Bergoglio would be elected as Pope Francis. At the moment, speculation is focusing on these men to succeed him:\n\nSeen as a moderate continuity candidate, Parolin was close to Francis. He has been the Vaticans secretary of state since 2013, playing a key role in diplomatic affairs, including delicate negotiations with China and governments in the Middle East. He is regarded as a reliable and trusted papal representative by secular diplomats. In 2018, he was the driving force behind acontroversial agreementwith the Chinese government on the appointment of bishops, criticised by some as a sellout to the communist regime. Parolins critics see him as a modernist and a pragmatist who places ideology and diplomatic solutions above hard truths of the faith. To his supporters, he is a courageous idealist and avid proponent of peace.\n\nTagle, a former archbishop of Manila, would be the first Asian pope, the region with the fastest-growing Catholic population. At one time he was considered to be Franciss preferred successor and a strong contender to continue the late popes progressive agenda, but recently appears to have fallen out of favour. He has suggested that the Catholic churchs stance on gay and divorced couples is too harsh, but has opposed abortion rights in the Philippines.\n\nTurkson would be the first black pope in centuries. He has been vocal on issues such the climate crisis, poverty and economic justice while affirming the churchs traditional positions on the priesthood, marriage between a man and a woman, and homosexuality. However, his views on the latter have loosened and he has argued that laws in many African countries are too harsh. He has spoken out on corruption and human rights.\n\nA leading conservative candidate, Erd has been a strong advocate for traditional Catholic teachings and doctrine. He would represent a big shift away from Franciss approach. He is widely regarded as a great intellect and a man of culture. Erd was a favourite of the late cardinalGeorge Pellwho believed he would restore the rule of law in the post-Francis Vatican. In 2015, Erd appeared to align himself with Hungarys nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orbn, when he opposed Franciss call for churches to take in migrants.\n\nAppointed a cardinal by Francis in 2019, Zuppi is considered to be on the progressive wing of the church, and would be expected to continue Franciss legacy, sharing the late popes concern for the poor and marginalised. He is (relatively) liberal on same-sex relationships. Two years ago, Francis made him theVaticanpeace envoy for Ukraine, in which capacity he visited Moscow to encourage gestures of humanity. While there he met Patriarch Kirill, the leader of the Russian Orthodox church and Vladimir Putins ally. He has also met Volodymyr Zelenskyy, Ukraines president.\n\nTolentino is one of the youngest potential successors to Francis, which could count against him  ambitious cardinals may not want to wait another 20 or 30 years before another shot at the top job. He has attracted controversy for sympathising with tolerant views on same-sex relationships and allying himself with a feminist Benedictine sister who favours womens ordination and is pro-choice. He was close to Francis on most issues, and argues that the church must engage with modern culture.\n\nGrech was seen as a traditionalist but began to embrace more progressive views after Francis was elected in 2013. His supporters argue that his changing opinions show his capacity for growth and change. He has criticised European political leaders who sought to limit the activities of NGO ships and has expressed support for female deacons.\n\nSince 2020, Pizzaballa has been the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem, a crucial role in advocating for the Christian minority in the Holy Land. After Hamass attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, Pizzaballaoffered himself as a hostagein exchange for children who were being held by Hamas in Gaza. He visited Gaza in May 2024 after months of negotiations. He would be expected to continue some aspects of Franciss leadership of the church, but has made few public statements on controversial issues.\n\nSarah is a traditional, Orthodox cardinal who at one time sought to present himself as aparallel authorityto Francis, according to a Vatican observer. In 2020, he co-authored a book with the then retired Pope Benedict defending clerical celibacy that was seen as a challenge to Franciss authority. He has denounced gender ideology as a threat to society, and has spoken out against Islamic fundamentalism. Like Turkson, he could make history as the first black pope in centuries.\n\n",

            "content": "The Conversation\n\nZimbabwe is the house of stone, both literally and figuratively, with its very name derived from the ancient stone city ofGreat Zimbabwe. Stone is more than just a material here  its the totem pole of the countrys identity, shaping both its history and artistic legacy. And theres no better place to witness this thanChapungu Sculpture Park.\n\nOn the outskirts of Harares industrial zone, the sprawling estate is both a gallery for stone artistry and a living landscape, home to over 90 varieties of indigenous trees, with a tributary of the Mukuvisi river running through it. Art and nature intertwine, offering a unique glimpse into Zimbabwes famous sculptural tradition.\n\nThe last time I visited, in 2021, founderRoy Guthriewas still around, but he has since passed away. His enduring legacy remains visible throughout the park.\n\nThe former refrigerator salesman turned stone broker was arguably one of the most influential figures in bringing Zimbabwean sculpture to the global stage. He organised international exhibitions and artist residencies. At one point he had more than 200 artists in his books.\n\nBut his vision extended beyond exporting artwork. His true ambition was to create the largest and most representative permanent collection of Zimbabwean stone sculpture. Here, in the open air, different generations of artists works stand side by side, demonstrating the evolution of the art form.\n\nToday I am here to meetMarcey Mushore, Guthries widow. She tells me the park is now managed by a trust and shares the many plans in place to honour and expand his work. One is establishing a dedicated museum.\n\nAs we walk from the entrance, beneath a canopy of trees nicknamed the cathedral, sculptures line the pathways, creating a quiet dialogue. Leading the way is our guide, artist-turned-administratorNicholas Kadzungura. He arrived at Chapungu as an apprentice and has never left. Today he is a walking institutional memory.\n\nMy book in progress,The Stone Philosophers, foregrounds the lives of the black Zimbabwean artists who made stone sculpture famous. I am grappling with this vexing question: What does a stone archive look like? One possible answer could be that it takes the form of a well-tended garden park with sculptures from Zimbabwes master sculptors.\n\nAs we stand facing the water, Mushore points towards a cluster of trees to indicate where the museum would be built. Perhaps, in a few years, the brush will be cleared, and in its place will rise a building dedicated to housing the history of Zimbabwean stone sculpture.\n\nDespite theinternational recognitionit has garnered since the 1960s, there is still no local museum solely dedicated to this art form. British curatorFrank McEwen, founding director of theNational Gallery of Zimbabwe, is often regarded as the architect of the movement. And Guthrie considered McEwen an influence.\n\nWith Zimbabwean sculpture, each piece tells a story, simple and elaborate, ranging from spirit-filled folk tales to depictions of the everyday moments that shape life. Youre confronted by human-size shapes of torsos, heads, animals and sometimes abstract figurations.\n\nWhile often categorised under the contentious label of Shona sculpture, the stone sculptors of Zimbabwe were not exclusivelyShona, the countrys largest ethnic group. The term was popularised by McEwen.\n\nIn fact, some of these artists came from other parts of Zimbabwe and from neighbouring countries like Zambia, Malawi or Angola, broadening the scope of the tradition. The sculptors primarily work with serpentine stone  especially springstone, fruit serpentine and leopard rock  alongside opal stone, verdite and dolomite, sourced mainly from the Great Dyke, a 300km geological formation in central Zimbabwe.\n\nBeyond the architectural metaphor of Zimbabwean writerNovuyo Rosa Tshumas novel,House of Stone, who were the builders and stone workers behind the legend of Zimbabwe?\n\nThe countrys name is thanks to the Shona peoples long artisanal tradition of stone working. Its not just a metaphor. Cities were built with blood, sweat and tears. Stone sculpture was not a peculiarity that was ignited by colonial encounter. It was always there, through generations and traditions. It was just not yet classified in anthropological terms, or exhibited in the colonial museum.\n\nThe modernstone sculpture movementin Zimbabwe emerged organically. It was a phenomenon shaped by groups of friends, siblings, and spouses whose work made a significant contribution to theAfrican modernismof the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nThe artists who brought stone sculpture to prominence formed networks that stretched from village to village, collaborating informally. Their work was eventually co-opted into the white-dominated art world ofRhodesia, as the country was known in colonial times. From there, it was exported to Europe and the US.\n\nAlthough these artists rose to prominence during a period of decolonisation in the 1950s and 1960s, they remained marginal figures in their own country. When Rhodesia declared unilateral independence in 1965, becoming an isolated stronghold of white supremacy, the history of stone sculpture became inseparable from the broader struggles faced by black Zimbabweans. It reflected the racist exclusions and hardships endured by its creators, who persisted against the odds.\n\nToday, Zimbabwe is better known for its young visual artists, who primarily work in painting, mixed media and collage. While stone sculpture was once the countrys dominant art form, its visibility has diminished  not in production, but in critical conversations about art. A simple internet search yields little on its history or artistic significance; instead, results are dominated by commercial gallery websites showcasing polished sculptures for sale, with little attention given to the artists or their creative processes.\n\nThis emphasis on the final product over the maker is not new. It traces back to the very origins of the stone sculpture movement. What we see here is a repressed archive, where gaps in documentation are not accidental but the result of historical omissions. These absences, in turn, expose deeper questions of power, access and visibility in the art world.\n\nAs we conclude our tour of Chapungu, a group of artists, seated on planks of wood and large stones, wave at us. They represent a new generation, carrying forward the tradition of stone sculpture in Zimbabwe, ensuring that this art form continues to evolve and endure.\n\nResearch Associate, University of Oxford\n\nThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.Read the original articlehere.\n\n",

The army, however, following his first online address, released a statement denouncing individuals misusing military uniforms.\n\nAddressing Zimbabweans via his YouTube and X accounts on Monday morning, Geza reiterated his call for Mnangagwa to step down.\n\nI have engaged in extensive consultations and received guidance and instructions from progressive elements within the senior echelons of the security apparatus. We have reached an accord: progressive units within the security forces will be deployed nationwide to assist the populace in their efforts to remove Mnangagwa and his criminal cabal, Geza proclaimed.\n\nGeza further asserted that the security forces would also apprehend all those surrounding Mnangagwa, whom he accuses of being unfit for office on the grounds of ill-health.\n\nThis stay-away will be accompanied by precisely calibrated strategic actions undertaken by progressive members of the security sector to exert maximum pressure on Mnangagwa and his inner circle to relinquish power forthwith.\n\nAll progressive elements within the security sector have received unequivocal instructions to arrest on sight all members of the inner circle cabal, he asserted.\n\n",

My children depend on me.\n\nThough Tsikini has the documentation to cross legally, she said many around her dont  not because they dont want to, but because they simply cant afford to.\n\nGetting a passport is expensive. So some people try to find other ways into SA just to buy food or make a little money, she said.\n\nYolanda Ferra, who makes the journey to SA to shop for essentials, shares that sentiment.\n\nIt would help if Zimbabwe werent so expensive. I wouldnt have to go through this just to get basics like mealie meal and oil, she said.\n\nThe way the world talks about SA, youd think its dangerous. But the people are friendlier than what we hear online.\n\nFor many like Ferra, SA isnt the dream, its the alternative. Her trips are frequent and often exhausting, but necessary to make life manageable back home.\n\nJohn Nyoni, a father of four, divides his year between Zimbabwe and SA, chasing short-term jobs in carpentry and mechanics.\n\nI spend half the year here [in SA], working. The other half, Im back with my family in Zim. But this time, I left early.\n\nTheres no work, and its been hard to survive. At least at home, I can be with my kids and try again later, he said.\n\n",
