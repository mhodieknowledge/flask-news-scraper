            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nZANU PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa has rebuked controversial businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei over his recent remarks calling for foreign nationals to be excluded from investing in certain sectors of the economy, describing the comments as xenophobic.\n\nTagwirei recently told a ZANU PF meeting that foreigners should be removed from sectors such as transport, retail, and energy.\n\nIn response, Mutsvangwa warned Tagwirei against pushing sentiments that could evolve into a movement resembling South Africas anti-immigrant vigilante group, Operation Dudula.\n\nZimbabwe was founded on the support of Africa, the Africa liberation committee and one of the beneficiaries, as a young guerrilla was the current president. Africa matters to us as a country. So you do not go about saying we do not want foreigners in Zimbabwe.\n\nWe do not want Dudula here. We are an African country. Africans are not foreigners in Zimbabwe. If there are certain things that were being done by certain Africans, let them be handled by legal processes, said Mutsvangwa.\n\nThe Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act reserves sectors such as retail, employment agencies, and advertising for Zimbabwean citizens. The law is aimed at correcting longstanding economic imbalances, however, foreign nationals have increasingly encroached on these sectors.\n\nMutsvangwa said Zimbabweans should not mistreat foreigners, noting that many citizens themselves live abroad.\n\nWe are a mature brown stick country which has got a lot of respect for our African brethren and when they are here we treat them exactly as Zimbabweans. We are not xenophobic like South Africa. When you live in glass house do not throw stones. The third biggest foreign currency earner in this country is the diaspora. They are strangers in other lands, he said.\n\nMutsvangwas remarks also signalled a shift in tone towards Tagwirei, whom he recently supported for co-option into the ZANU PF Central Committee despite having previously criticised him for allegedly buying influence.\n\nIn a pointed remark, Mutsvangwa suggested that Tagwirei should consider enrolling at the partys Herbert Chitepo School of Ideology.\n\nCertain things are only said by the President. They are not said by everybody otherwise everyone who thinks can be a president can be seen giving polices from his platform.\n\nIt may not be too late particularly for people who want to be presidents to go back to Chitepo school of ideology. I have mentioned it before, he said.\n\nTagwirei has been reported to harbour presidential ambitions after President Emmerson Mnangagwas term ends in 2028.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has delivered a landmark ruling declaring parts of Zimbabwes restrictive abortion law unconstitutional, siding with the Community Working Group on Health (CWGH) and Member of Parliament Nyasha Batitsa, who brought the challenge with human-rights lawyer Tendai Biti.\n\nJustice Sylvia Chirawu-Mugomba ruled that the Termination of Pregnancy Act, enacted in 1977, unlawfully excludes mental-health risk as a ground for lawful termination and fails to protect women with mental disabilities from pregnancies resulting from sexual exploitation.\n\nThe statutory omission creates a discriminatory regime, the judge wrote, adding that forcing women to carry pregnancies that cause grave mental-health consequences violates their rights to dignity, equality, humane treatment, bodily autonomy, and health. She stressed that the Constitution recognises health as physical, mental, and psychological well-being.\n\nCourt sides with CWGH and Batitsa\n\nCWGH and Batitsa had challenged section 4(a) and the definition of unlawful intercourse in section 2(1), arguing the law ignored modern constitutional and medical understanding of health and erased the vulnerability of institutionalised mental-health patients who cannot legally consent to sex.\n\nIn their filing, they argued: Section 4(a) unlawfully confines lawful termination to threats to physical health, ignoring that health includes mental and psychological well-being. They also warned that excluding pregnancies arising from sexual exploitation of mental-health patients fails to safeguard the dignity and bodily integrity of a particularly vulnerable group.\n\nJustice Chirawu-Mugomba agreed, finding that the law erased their lack of capacity to consent and, as a consequence, denied them access to lawful termination even in circumstances amounting to abuse.\n\nThe Court declared the offending provisions unconstitutional, but suspended the declaration for 18 months and referred the matter to the Constitutional Court for confirmation.\n\nA shift in Zimbabwes reproductive-rights landscape\n\nThe ruling marks what the Court described as a move away from a narrow, biomedical model of abortion focused only on physical survival, toward a constitutional model grounded in dignity, equality, and holistic health.\n\nThe Courts effects-based analysis, drawing on comparative jurisprudence from South Africa and Canada, recognised mental health as an integral component of the constitutional right to health, and held that statutory frameworks must evolve with contemporary medical understanding.\n\nCWGH welcomes historic victory\n\nThe Community Working Group on Health welcomed the judgment, calling it a breakthrough for women whose suffering has long been invisible under the law.\n\nThis is a historic victory for reproductive justice, CWGH said in response to the ruling. The Court has affirmed that mental-health endangerment must be recognised alongside physical risk, and that women with mental disabilities are entitled to equal protection from sexual exploitation and its consequences.\n\nThe organisation said the decision creates a clear mandate for Parliament, health authorities, and civil society to ensure abortion services are accessible and responsive to the realities of women living with mental disabilities.\n\nNext steps for Parliament\n\nOnce the Constitutional Court confirms the ruling, Parliament will be required to amend the Termination of Pregnancy Act to include mental-health risk as a lawful ground for termination and expand the definition of unlawful intercourse to include sexual exploitation of mental-health patients, conduct already criminalised under the Mental Health Act.\n\nWith the judgment now on record, legal observers say Zimbabwe has taken a decisive step toward modernising reproductive-health law in line with constitutional values and regional obligations under the Maputo Protocol, CEDAW, and the African Charter.\n\n",
