I will never resign from uMkhonto weSizwe, he said, sticking to his word that joining Zumas party was the best decision ever.\n\nShivambu stated that the consultations needed to be the answer to why and how the party should be funded.\n\nHe said the party on the pipelines is not going to be a personal project, a cult or a group of friends. He added that they will announce the leadership that is going to lead the consultations.\n\nShivambu dropped a political bombshell during a media briefing, claiming hed been accused of plotting to overthrow Zuma and take over.\n\nHe slammed what he called a bizarre and fabricated intelligence report, alleging it accused him of wielding supernatural powers capable of making people vanish  charges he dismissed as absurd and politically motivated.\n\nTheres nothing I do in private that I wont own publicly, Shivambu declared defiantly.\n\nHis explosive comments come amid a wave of infighting thats torn through the MK Party.\n\nShivambu, once a dominant policy voice in the EFF, was recently booted from his position as the MKPs sixth secretary-general.\n\nThe dismissal followed internal rebellion from both traditional leaders and a powerful Mpumalanga faction.\n\nThe final straw? His controversial Easter visit to the church of fugitive Malawian pastor Shepherd Bushiri  a move party insiders claim contradicted MKPs official line and sealed his political fate.\n\nRumours of Shivambus imminent departure had been swirling after he went rogue and called an unsanctioned press conference on Wednesday  a bold act that now appears to confirm his break from the partys inner circle.\n\n",

We have appointed consultants to do an evaluation of NDS 1 and their observations will serve as the base for NDS 2, which will be crafted following wide consultations, at the provincial and district levels. We should have a draft ready by October, said Ncube.\n\nAlthough Ncube emphasised that as NDS 1 approaches its end in December 2025, Zimbabwe remains solidly on track to attain an upper-middle-income society status, poverty and unemployment remain widespread among the general populace. The nation is reeling from a liquidity crunch amid a faltering Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency.\n\nNcube said NDS 2 will serve as the crucial five-year plan to leapfrog the country towards the ambitious Vision 2030, by which Zimbabwe will attain upper-middle-class society status.\n\nNcube said chairpersons of 10 national priorities that will underpin the strategy were hitting the ground running to contribute to the national document.\n\nThe final document is expected to be tabled by November 2025, ahead of the National Budget presentation. Thereafter, it will be officially launched by the President.\n\nFollowing NDS 2s launch, Ncube said there will be public awareness campaigns by amplifiers to extensively disseminate its contents so that there is buy-in for the important national blueprint.\n\n",
