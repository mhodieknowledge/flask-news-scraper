Mutseyami asked.\n\nIn his response, Mombeshora tried to give a background on the patient treatment processes in the country using the Shona language, despite the question being asked in English.\n\nThis did not satisfy Hwende, who said, On a point of order, the question was asked in English. The Standing Orders are clear that the Hon. Minister should respond in English.\n\nThe deputy speaker reminded Hwende that the law said otherwise.\n\nAfter Mombeshora gave a lengthy explanation, Hwende interjected and told Mombeshora that his response was not adequate, and this was one of the reasons why President Emmerson Mnangagwa left him and his deputy behind when he visited Parirenyatwa and Sally Mugabe Hospitals on Monday.\n\nNdosaka makatizwa na President pavakaenda ku Parirenyatwa (That is why the President left you when he visited Parirenyatwa hospital), shouted Hwende.\n\nHwende was immediately shown the exit by Gezi.\n\nHwende tried to resist the order, saying: Minister havasi kupindura mubvunzo, ngavapindure mubvunzo, ndobudirei?(The minister is not answering the question.

The Standing Rules and Orders say that before someone is chased out of the House, he must be informed of what his offence is, MP Makumire stated.\n\nOn another point of order, CCC MP Gladys.

If he seeks to elaborate further or if he wants us to know what is happening in the health sector, he can come up with a Ministerial Statement. There is a direct question, and he just needs to answer the question.\n\nAnother MP, Rungwave, stood up on a point of order and asked the minister to respond to the question instead of giving a historical background.\n\nA distraught Gezi said, So, have you decided to disrupt the operations of the House with points of order?\n\nGezi responded by ordering the MPs to take their seats for house business to continue.\n\n",

We have appointed consultants to do an evaluation of NDS 1 and their observations will serve as the base for NDS 2, which will be crafted following wide consultations, at the provincial and district levels. We should have a draft ready by October, said Ncube.\n\nAlthough Ncube emphasised that as NDS 1 approaches its end in December 2025, Zimbabwe remains solidly on track to attain an upper-middle-income society status, poverty and unemployment remain widespread among the general populace. The nation is reeling from a liquidity crunch amid a faltering Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency.\n\nNcube said NDS 2 will serve as the crucial five-year plan to leapfrog the country towards the ambitious Vision 2030, by which Zimbabwe will attain upper-middle-class society status.\n\nNcube said chairpersons of 10 national priorities that will underpin the strategy were hitting the ground running to contribute to the national document.\n\nThe final document is expected to be tabled by November 2025, ahead of the National Budget presentation. Thereafter, it will be officially launched by the President.\n\nFollowing NDS 2s launch, Ncube said there will be public awareness campaigns by amplifiers to extensively disseminate its contents so that there is buy-in for the important national blueprint.\n\n",
