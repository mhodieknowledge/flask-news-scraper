I am trying to focus on things which have consequences, said Mutsvangwa when questioned by the media.\n\nNational events have laid bare the fractures within the ruling party, with supporters displaying clear internal divisions. Recently two factions of ZANU PF supporters were heard chanting pro-Mnangagwa and another, pro-Chiwenga songs at Heroes Acre.\n\nAnother faction of war veterans, led by the outspoken Blessed Geza, has been calling for Mnangagwa to step aside, accusing him of overseeing a corrupt government.\n\nMnangagwas term ends in 2028, and he has stated that he will not run for another term, contrary to the sentiments of some of his supporters within ZANU PF.\n\nWithout mentioning names, Mutsvangwa suggested that Geza was being used to further a certain agenda within the party to unseat Mnangagwa.\n\nI have a lot of angst about the way he is being used by people who have a certain agenda. Comrade Geza, I do not know what other issues might be bothering you, but we, the war veterans, always remember I wish he would not follow fools who are misleading him. I am deeply concerned about what is happening with him, said Mutsvangwa.\n\nThe factional battles within ZANU PF are reminiscent of the internal politics that rocked the revolutionary party, resulting in the ousting of long-time ruler Robert Mugabe, who was replaced by Mnangagwa.\n\n",

However, what I want the Honourable Member to be aware of is the policy. When a policy is formulated, it is not wholly dependent on other stakeholders with whom we may collaborate to improve the livelihoods of our people.\n\nNevertheless, the issue is now before the Ministry and the Government at large because we had an agreement and collaboration with these stakeholders, who have now withdrawn their support.\n\nIt is now the mandate of the Ministry and the Government to ensure that these programmes, which were previously supported by external stakeholders, are now fully managed by the Ministry so that we can cover the gap left by the withdrawal of funding, said Kwidini.\n\nAn estimated 1.2 million Zimbabweans are benefiting from PEPFAR, with 1,600 public hospitals and clinics having received technical support from the U.S. government.\n\nLast year, Zimbabwe achieved the 95-95-95 goals in the fight against HIV/AIDS, but there are concerns that this progress might be derailed if the government fails to find a solution to fill the gap left by the withdrawal of U.S. support.\n\nKwidini said a clear plan is being formulated to allocate funds accordingly.\n\nIn terms of HIV and AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, these were originally Government programmes. We then had stakeholders who came in to fund those programmes. As we speak, our technocrats are working to ensure that we cover the gap left by these programme implementers, as they were supporting our national policies.\n\nHowever, as policymakers, and as I mentioned earlier, the Ministrys technocrats are currently exploring the best ways to develop solutions, particularly in budgeting and human capital, which have been affected by the withdrawal of these funds. Essentially, the policy already exists, but what has been withdrawn is the support we were receiving from the funders, he said.\n\n",

We have seen money supply tightened in the past few months and that really is what has sway on the local currency.\n\nThe central bank has curtailed money supply and kept the key interest rate at 35% since devaluing the ZiG by 43% in September to help it stabilize. It was launched last year to supersede the dollar in domestic transactions after previous attempts to stand up a local currency failed.\n\nTight monetary policy has also negatively impacted stocks. Governor John Mushayavanhu said last week the central banks tight policy stance comes with inevitable liquidity squeeze, necessary to instill market discipline and curtail disruptive speculative behavior in the economy.\n\nDifficulties in being able to exchange ZiGs for dollars have also excluded it from golds gains by casting doubt over the local currencys viability, Sibanda said.\n\nIt also points to the southern African nation not having enough hard currency foreign reserves to support a stable, freely convertible currency, said Hasnain Malik, an emerging markets strategist at Tellimer in Dubai.\n\nThe only real benefit its getting from bullions record run is in the value of the countrys gold reserves, said Sibanda. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwes stockpiles have risen to 2.67 tons from 1.5 tons at the ZiGs debut.\n\n",

            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nZimbabwes state miner is planning a fresh bid to kick-start a range of projects a year after the government took full control of the company.\n\nKuvimba Mining House, under new Chief Executive Officer Trevor Barnard, is looking to development banks, mining companies and traders to raise $950 million to develop lithium, platinum and gold assets, he said in an interview.\n\nAccess to all the large development banks, to all the funding, to all the major traders has just opened up, said Barnard, without identifying the potential financiers. The change in the ownership structure has been really a very good move for Kuvimba.\n\nPrevious attempts to raise funding were hindered because of speculation over the undisclosed identity of private investors who held about a third of the company. Earlier attempts to hold an initial public offering and form a venture with Russian investors were abandoned.\n\nKuvimbas main assets were formerly held by companies tied to Kudakwashe Tagwirei, a politically connected businessman, Bloomberg reported in 2021.\n\nTagwirei, a one-time adviser to Zimbabwes President Emmerson Mnangagwa, has been sanctioned for alleged corruption by the US and the UK. Kuvimba has always denied that he ever held a stake in the company.\n\nThe government has discussed handing some of Kuvimbas output to Trafigura Group to repay an outstanding fuel debt, Bloomberg reported in 2022.\n\nMore than half of the amount the company plans to raise will go toward a building an underground platinum mine at the long-delayed Darwendale project, according to Barnard, who took up his post in December. A lithium project the company estimates will cost as much as $275 million may be quicker to develop, he said.\n\nThe company has agreed a lithium joint venture with Chinese mining firms, and will finalise the deal by March before proceeding to build the first phase of the project known as Sandawana.\n\nIt will take about 15 months after signing to start production that will ultimately reach 500 000 tons of lithium concentrate per annum, Barnard said. The Chinese partners will finance the project and transfer it back to Kuvimba once the loan is repaid, a process he estimated would take less than five years.\n\nKuvimba also plans to develop a second area at Sandawana. Barnard said the company has already received interest from potential investors, including Cluff Africa Ltd. and a major European commodity trader that he declined to name. Other Chinese investors are also keen, he said, adding Kuvimba may sign a deal within six to 12 months.\n\nCluff didnt immediately respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nAt the Darwendale platinum deposit, the company initially plans to develop a smaller open-pit mine this year that will cost about $50 million to dig. It will pay another mining company to process that ore, according to Barnard.\n\nKuvimba is in talks with development banks for loans to finance the bigger, underground project and processing facilities, he said, without giving more detail. The targeted start date is within three years.\n\nZimbabwe holds the worlds second-biggest platinum reserves after South Africa and is Africas biggest lithium producer.\n\nKuvimba is now 70%-owned by the state sovereign wealth fund known as Mutapa Investment Fund, with entities held by the finance ministry, including state pension funds, power utilities and a deposit insurance fund, holding the rest, Barnard said.\n\n",

She added that these challenges have been further exacerbated by rising inflation, making food security an even more critical issue.\n\nShe said that the 10-year Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Program strategy and action plan for 2026-2035, adopted earlier this year at the AU Extraordinary Summit in Kampala, Ugandas capital, serves as a blueprint for advancing agricultural development and food systems across the continent.\n\nOur first strategic pillar is intensifying sustainable food production because we need to produce more. By 2050, Africas population is projected to reach 2.5 billion, so how are we going to feed this growing population? That is why we must intensify sustainable food production, Sacko told reporters.\n\nThe AU commissioner said that, in addition to increasing food production, African countries must also enhance food processing capabilities.\n\nShe said that improving these systems is essential not only for strengthening food security but also for creating job opportunities for Africas rapidly growing youth population.\n\nShe stressed that achieving food and nutrition security for all Africans requires promoting inclusive and equitable livelihoods, particularly since 70 percent of the continents population lives in rural areas.\n\nNoting that Africas agricultural production is predominantly rain-fed, Sacko underscored the need to develop resilient agri-food systems.\n\nWe need to look at the nexus between the environment and agriculture, including the impact of climate change on our largely rain-fed farming, she said, adding that it is essential to apply innovative technologies to mitigate the adverse effects of recurrent droughts and other natural disasters on Africas agriculture sector.\n\nThis years AU Summit is being held under the AUs 2025 theme: Justice for Africans and People of African Descent Through Reparations. As part of the annual gathering, the AU Executive Council, comprising foreign ministers from AU members, met on Wednesday and Thursday, followed by the Assembly of African Heads of State and Government, which will convene on Saturday and Sunday.\n\n",

Also joining the narrative are Chief Commander Ebenezer Obey, a Juju music icon, and Benson Idonije, celebrated music historian and Burna Boys grandfather. Their insights provide a variety of perspectives on Yoruba musics cultural significance and its enduring legacy.\n\nAdekunle Golds involvement as co-producer adds a dynamic layer to the documentary. The singer, whose genre-defying style blends Afropop, Fuji, Juju, R&B, and Amapiano, is positioned to bridge the gap between the past and the future of Yoruba music. This documentary is more than simply another project; its an opportunity to highlight the history of a sound that has shaped and will continue to shape music culture around the world, Gold says.\n\nDirector Abba T. Makama, known for such films as Green White Green and The Lost Okoroshi, is no stranger to using his lens to explore Nigerian culture. Weve already captured some incredibly fascinating interviews, Makama says. Having Adekunle Gold on board brings a contemporary touch that connects this story to a global audience.\n\nThe documentarys scope is as expansive as its subject matter, promising to examine Yoruba musics evolution across generations and its influence on Afrobeats. Interviews with musicians, producers, academics, and historians aim to deliver an immersive narrative, while Esiebos accompanying photography exhibition offers an intimate glimpse into the lives of the artists shaping this sound.\n\nExecutive producer Bobo Omotayo emphasized the importance of authentic storytelling. Our goal from the start has been to make a documentary that gives justice to Yoruba music by showcasing its essence, Omotayo says. With Adekunle Golds involvement, were adding a modern perspective to an already rich story.\n\nThe films release will be accompanied by a groundbreaking exhibition of Esiebos work, blending auditory and visual storytelling to honor Yoruba musics vibrancy and energy. Esiebos collection will highlight private and onstage moments of the featured artists, creating a multi-dimensional experience for viewers.\n\nAs Afrobeats continues to dominate global stages, The Odyssey seeks to remind audiences of its roots while celebrating its rise. The documentary aims to position Yoruba music not just as a regional phenomenon but as a pivotal force in the evolution of global music.\n\n",

            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nUNITED Kingdom investigative unitDug Uphas made sensational claims that Zimbabwes much-feared Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) considered eliminating opposition leader Nelson Chamisa in 2020, then have it blamed on Covid-19.\n\nChamisa, who was the front-runner to win Zimbabwes 2023 presidential elections, had been identified by CIO operatives as the main challenge to President Emmerson Mnangagwas second term in office.\n\nDug Ups article which seeks to explain how former CIO director general (DG) Isaac Moyo lost his job reveals intricate details about the goings on at the state security agency, including a plot to have him fired as way back as 2020, just over two years after his appointment by Mnangagwa.\n\nMoyo, reads the investigative piece, was viewed more as a diplomat rather than an operative. His juniors are said to have openly told Mnangagwa that having him as head of the CIO would cost him his presidency and advised that he be relieved of all duties.\n\nFor refusing to kill Chamisa and other problematic elements within Zimbabwes politics, Moyo was described as being too nice to lead the CIO.\n\nAs early as 2020, Mnangagwa received reports that claimed Moyo was a nice but ineffective DG. One such report, dated February 15, 2021, claimed Moyo had turned down two projects/operations that suggested using the Covid-19 pandemic as a smokescreen to kill opposition candidates including Nelson Chamisa.\n\nDug Up understands the proposal came from the operative division of the CIO and suggested that the elimination of opposition actors could be hidden behind the pandemic.\n\nThe DG refused to authorise the operations. His juniors wrote a report saying he was too nice to lead the CIO.\n\nMoyo found out and in a heated internal JOC meeting blasted his juniors. Provincial directors who sat in that meeting told Dug Up it was explosive and Isaacs deputies flat out told him You are not an Operative.\n\nThen leading the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) Chamisa survived numerous attempts on his life towards the 2023 elections.\n\nMoyo, who was eventually replaced by Fulton Mangwanya earlier this year, is reported to have unsuccessfully sought an exit in 2022 as confrontations and questions around his modus operandi from his juniors continued.\n\nAmongst many reforms Moyo brought to the CIO, operatives reportedly did not take kindly to him demanding that they surrender their identity cards before knocking off to reduce cases of abuse.\n\nMoyo, according to the article, also demanded reports for any case of excess force and barred the carrying of weapons.\n\n",
