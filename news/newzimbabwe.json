            "content": "By Chris Muronzi l Al Jazeera\n\nIT was 2017 and Jo Stak  wearing a red tuxedo jacket, a bow tie and a homburg hat  was belting out a Mandarin song.\n\nRed and yellow lights shimmered around him as a crowd of cheering, flag-waving fans on the Chinese version of The Voice gave a standing ovation at the end of his act.\n\nStaks melodious rendition of a 1992 Chinese song called The World Needs Warm Hearts was broadcast on national television.\n\nI was invited to perform at The Voice as a guest performer that year, Stak recalls.\n\nThe prime-time spot reflected how well-known hed become in China. On Douyin, Chinas version of TikTok, he had about five million followers.\n\nHed appeared on some of the countrys biggest television stations. Fans stopped him on the street to ask for a photo or just have a chat. The Zimbabwean singer was riding high.\n\nBeing Black in China makes you stand out naturally, he explains.\n\nAnd I was a musician [so that] made me stand out more.\n\nThe people who stopped him were often impressed that a foreigner would sing in Mandarin.\n\nToday, in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare, Joe Takawira  Staks real name  is an inconspicuous figure walking down a street in Budiriro 5, the working class suburb where he was born and raised.\n\nIn 2019, after seven years in China, his work visa expired, and he returned home.\n\nSporting his signature beard, grey sweatpants, sneakers and a black T-shirt, he lights a cigarette.\n\nHe saunters past street vendors selling fresh produce and condiments, stops at a corner to chat with a friend, then goes about his day. Whenever he runs into someone he knows, he greets them with a fist bump and a toothy grin.\n\nWhen hes at home, Stak listens to instrumental music and writes songs in Mandarin.\n\nThis is how I spend my time in Budiriro, he says, shrugging.\n\nIt feels a long way from China and the career he enjoyed there. He has not found the same acclaim back home.\n\nEven his neighbours had no idea about his previous life.\n\nClemence Kadzomba, who runs a tyre shop in Staks neighbourhood, had no idea who his neighbour was until some of his clients who were among the 20,000 Zimbabweans living in China recognised him.\n\nI couldnt believe it, 43-year-old Kadzomba says, grinning.\n\nThey were so excited to see him, like he was some big deal. And yet, here he was, just hanging out with us like it was nothing.\n\nUnexpected journey to stardom\n\nStaks musical journey has its roots in the Methodist church-run school he attended as a teenager.\n\nHe sang in his church choir, something he loved, and was part of a group of students who recorded a gospel album.\n\nThe album did well, and some of the songs have close to a million views on YouTube.\n\nMusic runs in his family, says Stak, the middle of three brothers. His older brother wrote songs at school while the youngest brother plays the piano.\n\nAfter graduating, Stak enrolled to study Mandarin in China in 2012, motivated by his love for Chinese culture, which began as a boy watching Jackie Chans action films. He was 20 years old when he moved to Shanghai.\n\nThis came at a time when Zimbabwe was pivoting away from the West with the late leader Robert Mugabes Look East policy, adopted in response to United States and European Union sanctions after a 2002 presidential election marred by violence.\n\nMugabe opened Zimbabwes doors to Asia, leading to an influx of Chinese investment as more Zimbabweans headed to China to work or study.\n\nBy 2014, Stak was proficient in Mandarin and started posting videos of himself singing in Mandarin to Douyin.\n\nI wanted to explore music in a different language, he explains as he lights a cigarette and sits back in his chair on the red-floored veranda of his house.\n\nHe would sing R&B, hip-hop and pop songs in Mandarin and English and started to get booked for gigs.\n\nMy first gig was at Yuyingtang, a music bar in Shanghai, he recalls. He says the venue wasnt very big but he made $1,500  enough to pay for his food and accommodation for months.\n\nThat gig made him realise he could make money from his talent, and it marked the start of his career as a professional pop singer in China.\n\nAfter that, he played at music bars, festivals, weddings and nightclubs  performing mostly in Mandarin.\n\nOf the 37 songs he recorded, one was in the top 10 on the Chinese music streaming service Baidu Music.\n\nIt meant a lot to me, Stak says excitedly, although it earned him only 5,000 yuan ($865).\n\nThen in 2017, he joined the Foundation Band, a group of musicians from Africa, the US and Europe that performed Chinese and Western pop music and hip-hop at weddings and nightclubs.\n\nAs the lead vocalist, he caught the attention of Chinese television networks, leading to performances on major stations.\n\nI was surprised by my success in China, Stak admits.\n\nLife there was good. His daily routine consisted mainly of eating, singing and drinking.\n\nHis favourite dish was hotpot  a meal for which diners cook raw ingredients like seafood and tofu in a shared pot of broth at the table.\n\nEven now, when I miss it, I go to Chinese restaurants, he says.\n\nHed perform at night, and during the day, hed roam along Shanghais historic waterfront with its colonial-era architecture and rooftop bars.\n\nStak made good money. They pay artists well  I mean 1,000 US dollars minimum for a 10-minute show.\n\nBut he also felt accepted and at home in China, where he says the music industry welcomes foreign talent and invests in it.\n\nUnlike many foreign artists singing in English who can struggle to break into the Chinese market, Stak had an edge  he was an African singing in Mandarin, and there were few performers like him. His ability to perform popular Chinese songs endeared him to audiences.\n\nComing home to anonymity\n\nThen in 2019, Staks visa expired. Aged 27, he returned to a country that was in the midst of a devastating economic crisis.\n\nHis parents  his fathers an engineer, his mothers a teacher  were coping, but across the country, people were struggling with hyperinflation, foreign currency shortages and an unemployment rate of more than 50 percent.\n\nStak found work as a translator  and quickly discovered that Zimbabwes music and social media landscapes were unfamiliar to him.\n\nHe says much of his fame and success came from Chinese apps, mostly Douyin. But the apps he relied on are available only in China as Beijing restricts foreign digital platforms through its Great Firewall.\n\nWithout them, Stak could no longer reach his Chinese audience.\n\nHis career vanished when he left Shanghai. I feel like a part of me remained in China, he explains.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, nobody knew him. He started recording some music  and contemplated a switch to gospel, which is popular in the country  but hes struggled to promote his songs. When he contacted a local radio station to play his music, he never heard back.\n\nStak believes that if Chinese social media were accessible to global audiences, he would still have a thriving musical career.\n\nThat would have brought me international recognition, he says.\n\nFor now, the translation work pays well. He currently works for a Chinese mining company, translating English or Shona into Mandarin. When he isnt working, he tries to write music, but full-time work leaves little time to reinvent himself or find an audience for his Chinese pop.\n\nLonging for the stage\n\nToday, Stak is torn. He dreams of a return to China but also wants to rebuild his music career in Zimbabwe, where he hopes to marry and raise a family.\n\nI want to start afresh here, he says.\n\nBut I also miss China, a country that was very good and welcoming to him, he adds.\n\nWhether its in Asia or Africa, he itches to return to the stage. I miss the spotlight, he says.\n\nFive years after he left China, Stak remains popular there. A couple of months ago, his Chinese boss uploaded a video of him singing in Mandarin. [He] posted me on his WeChat status, and people were asking him about me. They were like, Where is this guy?\n\nStak takes a moment and then adds, The Chinese love me.\n\n",

There were 44 rejected ballots.\n\nVoter apathy characterised the plebiscite, with turnout pegged at 17,2% of Glen View Souths registered voter population of 31 519.\n\nThe seat fell vacancy after the death of Grandmore Hakata.\n\nCommenting on Zanu PFs by-election victory, award-winning journalist and political observer, Hopewell Chinoono blamed the divided opposition for the result, suggesting the alternative is dead.\n\nToday, Glen View is in the hands of Zanu PF for the first time in 25 yearsnot because Zanu PF has done anything fantastic, but because it faces an opposition built around a popular personality, not ideas or a cause.\n\nMany of us think of ourselves as educated, but education is not the certificates we holdit is the ability to use the knowledge we gained from school to think and compute ideas, said Chinoono.\n\nWhat is happening today was predicted on this page in 2022; that without a structured opposition with a Constitution, Zanu PF would pounce.\n\nBut as usual, I was insulted and told about a plan called strategic ambiguity. What happened to the plan?\n\nZanu PF will be in power with a huge majority post 2028 if things remain the way they are. Reality does not hero-worship personalitiesit favours common sense.\n\nThe reality of politics is that if it is hinged on personalities rather than ideas and a cause, the regime becomes stronger because it either buys or immobilises those personalities.\n\nThe MDC survived as long as it did because Morgan Tsvangirai, for the most part, was not threatened by those more educated or more talented than himhe was secure. The pastor is not.\n\nTsvangirai understood the importance of structures and of allowing leaders at various levels to be independent and strong.\n\nWhat you saw in Glen View is the beginning of the total end of the 1999 project, he added.\n\nThe current opposition leaders are the best thing that has ever happened to Zanu PF, Chinoono opined.\n\nWhy would you not want people who are hero-worshipped yet do nothingwho cannot even speak-out about corruption or draconian laws against the citizens?\n\nWhenever you see infighting in Zanu PF, it means there is no opposition to speak of. We are in the worst period Zimbabwe has experienced since 1999. The citizens must be told the truth; 2028 is gone save for a miracle!\n\nThe oppositions emphasis on personalities rather than ideas and causes is a recurring issue that has weakened the opposition and strengthened the regime.\n\nChinoono further stated that the lack of a clear and consistent message from the opposition on critical issues like corruption and draconian laws is a reflection of a failed leadership.\n\nIt is strange that you have adults who defend the mediocrity of their leaders, it is mind boggling as it is sad to watch! It is like watching a man self-harm yet you cant do anything about it! Continue to fool yourselves!\n\n",
