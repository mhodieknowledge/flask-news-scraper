            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nZIMBABWEANS must follow the law and get proper documentation that allows them to stay legally in foreign countries.\n\nResponding to a request by an opposition Member in Parliament this week during a Question-and-Answer session, Parliament Speaker Jacob Mudenda said it was impossible to have medical facilities at Zimbabwe Embassies (South Africa) to cater for illegal immigrants (Zimbabweans) who are being denied access to health care in that country.\n\nCitizen Coalition for Change (CCC)s Mbizo MP Corban Madzivanyika had raised the matter over xenophobia against Zimbabweans being denied access to health services in the neighbouring country.\n\nWe have a situation here where the citizens of Zimbabwe who are living in South Africa illegally are being denied the right to seek medical assistance in case of illness.\n\nDoes Zimbabwe have plans to put hospitals maybe in our embassies for the sake of protecting or assisting these vulnerable Zimbabweans who are being abused left, right and centre in a foreign land?\n\nThe Speaker responded curtly.\n\nHow can we have such facilities for illegal people? No, they must follow the law. We have borders here who they can get proper papers to enter South Africa or any other country. So entertaining illegal people who enjoy illegalities, I do not think is the right thing.\n\nAnother legislator Lungile Ncube had earlier on asked what policy was there to protect locals in foreign land.\n\nWhat was the government policy on Zimbabwean nationals who were continuously being denied access to public hospitals and healthcare centres in South Africa?\n\nHealth and Child Care Deputy Minister Sleiman Kwidini replied saying the issue needed a holistic solution.\n\nI think the question mostly deals with Foreign Affairs because all citizens who are in a foreign land are registered there and are known for the business they are doing there.\n\nNevertheless, in humanity cases, if someone is sick in any way, there is no way one can be denied access to health because health is key to everyone, Kwidini said.\n\nThe deputy minister said the case of South Africa was one of its kind of behaviour, which was happening because of the Dudula or xenophobic attacks against foreigners.\n\nSouth Africans have alleged that foreigners were taking their resources and jobs as well.\n\nKwidini explained that most of the foreign nationals, especially from Zimbabwe were growing the South African economy by providing services.\n\nIt is an issue that needs to be looked into in a holistic approach between the governments so that no one is denied access to healthcare services, Kwidini said.\n\nWe do not have any government declaration from South Africa that they do not want Zimbabweans to go to hospitals but those are unscrupulous people seeking attention.\n\nSo, we are also encouraging Zimbabweans to go to South Africa legally. That is why we also have passport offices there so that you become well documented in the event that you get sick, you can go to the hospital legally.\n\nMeanwhile, the South African government this week extended the validity of the Zimbabwe Exemption Permit (ZEP) to thousands of Zimbabwean nationals whose permits expired to May 2027.\n\nI have decided to extend the validity of the Zimbabwe Exemption Permits (ZEP) until May 28, 2027, South African Home Affairs minister Leon Schreiber stated in a Gazette.\n\n",

G Zhuwarara represented Kanyekanye.At the centre of the dispute was the Borrowdale family home, which Sithole maintained had been jointly built and sustained through the couples collective efforts over their 18-year marriage. She submitted that her role in managing family finances, raising children, and supporting the household constituted substantial indirect contributions deserving legal recognition.While the Supreme Court ultimately upheld the High Courts ruling, it acknowledged the complex nature of property distribution in long-term marriages and reaffirmed the principles under the Matrimonial Causes Act and landmark cases such as Takafuma v Takafuma, which guide equitable division of matrimonial property.Importantly, legal observers have noted that recent High Court judgments have, in several instances, awarded immovable property to a spouse who did not contribute directly to its purchase or construction, recognising domestic, emotional, and managerial roles as valuable forms of contribution.The court also confirmed that the custody decision was made with due regard to the best interests of the minor child, noting that both parents had demonstrated care and commitment throughout the proceedings.Sitholes matter has generated widespread discussion on the treatment of non-financial contributions in marriage and the growing recognition of the diverse ways in which spouses contribute to family life and shared prosperity.\n\nThe judgment, delivered by Justice George Chiweshe in chambers on October 1, 2025, followed an appeal by Sithole seeking the Supreme Courts reconsideration of a High Court ruling on the distribution of matrimonial assets and custody arrangements.\n\nSithole, represented by Choice Damiso, had applied for condonation and an extension of time to pursue her appeal, arguing that the matter raised important questions on the recognition of spousal contributions, both financial and non-financial during the course of marriage.R.

There has been an inconsistency in the service that we get from our network providers. I do not know whether they are now overwhelmed to an extent that we may need new players in this industry.You try to phone, you can try maybe 10 times, your phone does not go through, they take your money and there is no way they will then repay you for the loss.I therefore, Mr. Speaker, request that either the ministry or POTRAZ protect members of the public who trust that these people are doing a reasonable job for the people of Zimbabwe and not a rip-off, Togarepi said.Further, the MP said he was praying that the Information, Communication Technology (ICT) Portfolio Committee be involved in trying to protect the interests of consumers.We find the poor service delivery persisting for more than a year now. I think it is no longer technological challenges; it is like they do not care. So, I really pray, Mr. Speaker, that members of the public be protected from this rip-off, added Togarepi.Parliament Speaker Jacob Mudenda ordered the ICT Portfolio Committee to go ahead with investigations on the matter.I want to believe that the relevant Portfolio Committee has taken heed and they should proceed to make an enquiry on the matter, Mudenda said.Over the past few months, mobile network has been a challenge countrywide without a real explanation on the causes of the call connectivity nightmare.There are three GSM mobile network operators in Zimbabwe, namely Econet, NetOne and Telecel.A GSM is a global standard for 2G (second generation) digital cellular technology, enabling mobile phones to make voice calls, send text messages (SMS) and transmit data using protocols.\n\nTHE countrys network providers are ripping -off clients of their hard-earned money through poor services, Zanu PF Chief Whip and Gutu South MP Pupurai Togarepi has said.\n\nRising on a point of national interest in the National Assembly this Thursday, Togarepi begged for the protection of consumers by the Postal and Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (POTRAZ) or the Information Communication Technology, Postal and Courier Services ministry.I stand on a point of national interest regarding poor service delivery by network providers.Out there, there has been a serious rip-off of consumers.
