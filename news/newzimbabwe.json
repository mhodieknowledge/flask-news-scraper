Economic empowerment must be genuine, said Chiwenga as he introduced President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nWe must always remember that we are not the alpha and omega of Zimbabwes journey, ours is to carry forward the torch passed to us by those who gave everything without expectation of reward, he further warned.\n\nChiwenga is in a tight and tense race against businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei to replace Mnangagwa in 2028 although there are concerted efforts to illegally extend the 83-year-old Zanu PF leaders term in office to 2030.\n\nHaving described Tagwirei, shadowy character Wicknell Chivayo and some of their associates as Zvigananda, a colloquial Zimbabwean term that means criminals, Chiwenga reportedly dropped a dossier last month detailing how billions of US dollars were being siphoned by the monied clique.\n\nThat was to be later dismissed in this weeks Politburo where Mnangagwa stood his ground and defended Tagwirei, who has been identified as the preferred successor be it in 2028 or 2030.\n\nChiwenga, who sensationally revealed that late liberation war hero General Josiah Tongogara knew that he would not see an independent Zimbabwe, said the much talked about 2030 Agenda must be understood as their duty for future generations rather than their own.\n\nHe added: Some of them like our late commander General Josiah Magama Tongogara knew they would not see a liberated Zimbabwe. He was told openly when the day comes that this country is going to be free, you will die, but he still fought until the last day.\n\nThey fought for the future, not for themselves, Vision 2030 therefore must be understood in the same light. It is about a Zimbabwe we will bequeath to generations to come.\n\nFactional fights within Zanu PF have now pitted Mnangagwa against Chiwenga in a clear repeat of what transpired between the former and his predecessor Robert Mugabe before the 2017 coup.\n\nQuestions about whether Chiwenga still wields influence within the military, an arm that was instrumental in toppling Mugabe, while Tagwireis financial muscle has proven enough a threat for him.\n\nEven staunch critics such as Christopher Mutsvangwa, who for a time reportedly dreamt of taking over from Mnangagwa, are now strongly behind the Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) elder, Tagwirei.\n\n",
