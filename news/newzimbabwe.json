He also lied that he could process CoS for qualified nurses intending to secure employment in the United Kingdom (UK).\n\nFollowing his conviction, the presiding magistrate sentenced Vanhuvaone to 84 months in jail, suspending 18 months for five years on condition of good behaviour. A further 24 months were set aside on condition that he restitutes the complainants US$8,165 by July 30, 2025. He will, therefore, serve an effective 42 months imprisonment.\n\nThe National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) said this case sends a strong message to would-be conmen on the dire consequences of fraud, especially when public trust is manipulated for personal gain.\n\n",

I strongly encourage efforts to fight this cancer in Zimbabwes economy that robs the Zimbabwean people of the benefit of their precious resources and raises exponentially the cost of doing business in Zimbabwe, she said.\n\nTremont added that a corruption-free business and trade investment environment would make the sector vibrant and lucrative for the people of Zimbabwe.\n\nA healthy, vibrant investment climate would create a culture of opportunity  an opportunity for what our founders 249 years ago called life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That is what we celebrate today, she said.\n\nAlthough he did not directly address the issue of corruption, Foreign Affairs Minister Amon Murwira reiterated Zimbabwes commitment to enhancing its investment climate. He admitted that the country is still learning and expressed pride in taking inspiration from the US.\n\nWe wish, therefore, to invite all potential United States investors to come and invest in Zimbabwe. As you are aware, the government of Zimbabwe is enhancing the investment climate with a view to safeguarding investors interests and guaranteeing the protection of investments. In 45 years, we have learned a lot. We are still learning a lot. We are not 249 years, Murwira said.\n\nThe latest Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) reflects a worsening corruption situation in Zimbabwes public sector, according to Transparency International (TI), and the country has performed poorly on global corruption indices for years.\n\nThe CPI ranks Zimbabwe 158th out of 180 countries, where the top-ranked country is perceived to have the most honest public sector.\n\nIn 2023, Zimbabwe was ranked 149th, meaning the level of corruption has increased, with the Southern African country slipping nine steps down the scale.\n\nCurrently,questions have been raised overthe cost of the recently commissioned Trabablas Interchange in Harare. Many believe the US$88 million price tag is excessive compared to regional market rates.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nThe Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission has told IOL that scores of South African nationals are languishing in Zimbabwes Harare Remand Prison, awaiting deportation, after they were arrested for breaching the neighbouring countrys immigration laws.\n\nAnother group of three South African men are not facing deportation, but will face trial in Zimbabwes courts after they were charged for conspiracy to commit armed robbery. On the other hand, the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission has established that a South African woman has been convicted for dealing in dangerous drugs in Zimbabwe, and has sentenced to 10 years in jail.\n\nIn an interview, chairperson of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission, Jessie Majome told IOL that by Thursday, she had established that there are six men, who have been certified to be South African nationals in conjunction with South Africas High Commission in Zimbabwe, who are ready for deportation from the Harare Remand Prison.\n\nShe said a seventh man in the group will not be deported to South Africa, as the diplomatic mission has informed Zimbabwes authorities that the elderly man is not a South African citizen.\n\nI had gone to the prison to visit a certain group of people who had been in custody for too long. I then noticed that there were 66 foreign nationals in the Harare Remand Prison for men. It is an issue that is of interest to the Commission because it involves a special category of people who should not be in prison; even though irregular immigration is against the law, they should not be treated like individuals awaiting trial, she said.\n\nMajome said Zimbabwe does not have independent holding facilities for people arrested for violating the countrys immigration laws, and verifications happen while the people are detained in prison.\n\nAt the time of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commissions visit in April, it was established that there were about seven South African men, but Majome said the number has now risen because other South African nationals were found in the womens section of Harare Remand Prison.\n\nChairperson of the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission, Jessie Majome spoke to IOL on the plight of South Africans detained in Zimbabwe. Image:Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission\n\nIn its April report, the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission stated that detained foreign nationals at the Harare Remand Prison comprised 16 people from Burundi; 12 from Ethiopia; 11 from Democratic Republic of Congo; two from Rwanda; two from Uganda; eight from Malawi; one from Libya; one from Mozambique; one from the Peoples Republic of China; seven from South Africa; one from Pakistan; one from Taiwan; one from France; one from Britain and one from Cape Verde.\n\nDuring the interview with IOL on Thursday, Majome said her organisation has since established that there are three South Africans in the womens section of the Harare Remand Prison.\n\nThere are three South African nationals, who are women in the Harare Remand Prison, it is a separate prison. Two of those women are awaiting deportation back to South Africa.\n\nThree of the detained South African men are facing charges of conspiracy to commit armed robbery. Those ones are not awaiting deportation, but they are going to appear before the Harare Magistrates Court in June.\n\nSo it is seven South African men awaiting deportation, and two women. The third South African woman has been convicted of dealing in dangerous drugs and has been sentenced to 10 years in prison in Zimbabwe, she said.\n\nThe human rights activist and attorney told IOL that the Harare Remand Prison is heavily crowded.\n\nConditions of prisons in Zimbabwe depend on where the person is. Where the three women are detained, at the womens prison, it is not crowded at all but at the Harare Remand Prison where the men are, there is crowding, she said.\n\nMajome reiterated the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services requires additional funding, and the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission has been at the forefront for campaigning for additional funds for the ZPCS.\n\nThe human rights activist added that this is not the first or last time South African nationals have been detained in Zimbabwean prisons.\n\nThis is not a new thing, even though I understand it is of interest. This happens a lot. It just so happened that on that particular visit, we highlighted that in our report.\n\nThis is a common phenomenon the world over. What is important is to always remember the humanity and the equality of all human beings wherever they are  be it in prison, whether they have jumped the border, they must be treated with dignity.\n\nMigration is a phenomenon of human beings and must be done legally, but if it is not, human rights must still be upheld, she told IOL.\n\nLast year, IOL published a story where non-profit organisation Baagi Ba South Africa was advocating for the South African government to enter into international prisoner transfer treaties.These treaties would allow South African prisoners convicted in other countries to be brought back home, to serve their sentences in South Africa.\n\nIn countries where such programmes exist, including the United States, they are designed to alleviate the hardships faced by offenders incarcerated far from home and facilitate their rehabilitation.\n\nAt the time,IOL interviewed Glory Matipile, founder and chief executive of Baagi Ba South Africa, who insisted that effective rehabilitation for the hundreds of South Africansimprisoned around the world requires them to serve their sentences within South Africas correctional system. A key benefit of this, she noted, is the ability to speak the local language.\n\nGlory Matipile, founder and chief executive of Baagi Ba South Africa, a non-governmental organisation fighting for South Africans to serve jail sentences back home. Image:Supplied\n\nThis organisation, Baagi Ba South Africa, was founded in 2018, and so far, we have about 260 young people working across South Africa to raise awareness and provide support to families with relatives convicted abroad. We also collaborate with organisations that assist South Africans in foreign prisons. We reached out to our representatives in South African embassies but did not receive much support. Now, we work with organisations in foreign countries to facilitate communication between imprisoned South Africans and their families back home, she said.\n\nShe said with the economic hardships, it is almost impossible for most families in South Africa to travel to visit their incarcerated relatives in countries including Brazil, Philippines or Hong Kong  a special administrative region of the Peoples Republic of China.\n\nSouth Africa is one of the few countries in the world without international prisoner transfer. Such a programme already exists in the United Nations, and what is left is for South Africa to adopt it and follow the rules that are already there, and being used by other countries. The essence is that if we had such a programme, South Africans convicted in foreign countries would be sent home to serve near their families. Foreigners in our prisons would them be moved to go and serve their sentences in their home countries so that rehabilitation can take place.\n\nYou will remember that former president Nelson Mandela was advocating for prisoners rights. We are being denied to have such a policy.\n\nShe said her organisations records hasaround 800 names of South Africans convicted and sentenced in foreign countries.\n\n",

We have seen outbreaks of diseasesa situation that is wholly unacceptable. Such conditions must become a thing of the past.\n\nTherefore, in line with Vision 2030, my Government continues to prioritise the creation of clean, safe, and modern urban environments, which are engines of economic growth. Cleanliness and the efficient management of service delivery are not just indicators of good governance but also essential benchmarks for a nations competitiveness, said Mnangagwa.\n\nGeo Pomona, which was tasked with refuse collection earlier this year in an arrangement spearheaded by the Minister of Local Government, Daniel Garwe, is yet to fully fulfil its mandate.\n\nPiles of uncollected refuse in residential areas remain a sore sight months after the companys takeover.\n\nThis has angered residents, who have cast doubt on the impact of Geo Pomonas operations, despite the governments prior praise for the waste management initiative.\n\nFurther fuelling residents frustration is the US$40 per tonne that the City Council will pay Geo Pomona for waste disposal. The company is expected to collect 650 tonnes daily once operations are in full swing.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the Harare model should be replicated in other local authorities.\n\nThrough the purchase of this equipment, we must see the waste management system being capacitated to efficiently and consistently collect waste across all parts of Harare.\n\nI urge sector players in other towns and cities to take a leaf from such initiatives towards improving waste management in our country, he said.\n\n",

And not least, Rubys momentous trip home to get the kids.\n\nWhen Ruby arrived in the UK in January 2024, she quickly learnt that the real England is far from the romanticised version people have back home.\n\nWhile not exactly the greener pastures she expected, her visa offered her the opportunity to earn pounds. After struggling to support her family on a teachers salary in Zimbabwe, that meant everything to her.\n\nRubys first job involved providing round-the-clock care to a woman in her nineties. She was paid to work eight hours a day, but it was a 24-hour job. She says sometimes shed call her friends just to cry.\n\nBut Ruby says she was lucky. The woman she was caring for was kind and did everything she could to make Ruby feel at home. Not like the horror stories Ruby heard from colleagues about being spat on by racist clients.\n\nBut arguably, the biggest challenge will begin with the start of their family life in the UK. Ruby explained: In a year or two, [the kids are] going to be different people. But, I am there to remind them of their roots.\n\n",

            "content": "Fox News\n\nElon Musk and President Donald Trumps feud about the Big, Beautiful Bill continued on Thursday when the tech billionaire responded to the presidents criticism in a post on X.\n\nWithout me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate. Such ingratitude, Musk wrote in a post responding to Trumps remarks about him.\n\nWhile speaking with reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said that he was very disappointed by Musks vocal criticisms of the bill. The president claimed that Musk knew what was in the bill and had no problem with it until the EV incentives had to be cut.\n\nIm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people. He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it, Trump said. All of a sudden, he had a problem. And he only developed the problem when he found out that were going to have to cut the EV mandate.\n\nMusk pushed back on the presidents claim in another post on X and said that this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!\n\nThe Tesla founder has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration and Republicans over the last few days because of the legislation that the president has pushed. Musk has taken to calling it the Big Ugly Bill and at one point advocated for a Slim, Beautiful Bill.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Musk highlighted Trumps old posts that seemingly align with the tech billionaires current positions and objections to the Big, Beautiful Bill.\n\nTrump turned to social media on Thursday afternoon to criticize Musk, who he appointed to find ways to cut $2 trillion after forming the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nElon was wearing thin, I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY! Trump said in one post.\n\nThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elons Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didnt do it! he wrote in another.\n\nMusk has also faced criticism from House Speaker Mike Johnson, who said on Wednesday that he was surprised by the former DOGE leaders objections to the legislation. The Republican lawmaker said that he and Musk, whom he considers a friend, had a great conversation about the bill on Monday. Johnson told reporters on Wednesday that Musk was flat wrong about the legislation.\n\nMeanwhile, there are several Republicans who have expressed solidarity with Musk, including Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. Additionally, Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said that Musk was right to be concerned that Americans are quickly becoming debt slaves.\n\nNow that the bill has passed the house, its up to the Senate to meet Trumps July 4 deadline.\n\n",
