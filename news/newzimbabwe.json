We need decisive leadership, firm timelines, and an unwavering commitment to the rule of law, Ngobeni said.She said while ActionSA supports a humane and orderly approach to immigration, the ongoing pattern of temporary measures has eroded public confidence, undermined border integrity, and perpetuated inequality between citizens and foreign nationals.Ngobeni said the ministers justification that consultations with the Immigration Advisory Board were still ongoing offers no comfort to South Africans who have waited years for decisive action.There is still no clear, time-bound plan to resolve this long-standing issue, leaving our borders porous and our immigration system in disarray, she said.ActionSA has called on Schreiber to publish a comprehensive transition plan with firm deadlines for the conclusion of consultations and implementation of immigration reforms. The party also urged the strengthening of the Border Management Authority and improved internal enforcement to curb illegal immigration.Ngobeni said every further delay deepens social tensions, weakens accountability, and tells law-abiding South Africans that their government lacks the political courage to lead.On Thursday, IOL reported that the Helen Suzman Foundation welcomed the extension of both the Zimbabwean and Lesotho Exemption Permits, saying it would prevent potential humanitarian harm and allow time for a more sustainable policy framework to be developed.According to the Foundation, the extension will allow current ZEP and LEP holders to remain lawfully in South Africa while the minister conducts nationwide consultations. This follows a 2023 Pretoria High Court ruling in which HSF successfully challenged a previous decision to terminate the ZEP programme without prior notice or public consultation.The ministers directive clarifies that ZEP and LEP holders cannot be arrested, detained, or deported under section 34 of the Immigration Act due to an invalid exemption certificate. Holders may also freely enter or depart South Africa under immigration regulations and will not need to produce a valid exemption certificate when applying for another visa category under section 10(2) of the Act.\n\nIn a statement, ActionSA parliamentary chief whip Lerato Ngobeni MP said the extension showed the governments unwillingness to confront South Africas immigration crisis head-on.\n\nSouth Africa does not need endless extensions.

Dealing with human beings, at times you think that you have the best player and when it comes to the issue of real work, it might not be in tandem with your expectations. This is an ongoing process and if they fail to perform, the contracts will be terminated, he said.He expressed commitment to conclude the Plumtree  Maitengwe Border Post Road in Bulilima District currently being constructed by local firm, Enock Construction Company which has since commenced work on a 10km stretch that starts in Plumtree town and extends just beyond Tsambani Shops at Makwa River in Village 28 along the Plumtree  Dombodema Road.From Harare through Masvingo to Beitbridge, works are ongoing, and today we are here in Bulilima District on this important road leading to the Maitengwe Border Post. The project will not only enhance cross-border trade but also uplift local livelihoods through employment creation.This road will help open up our borders to promote trade and improve the lives of people in this community, said Mhona.On completion, the road is expected to provide a vital link between Zimbabwe and Botswana through the busy Maitengwe Border Post, easing congestion and boosting trade once complete.\n\nHe made the remarks while speaking to the press at the end of the week-long media tour in Plumtree Friday as he emphasised that badly performing contractors poor jobs will not be tolerated going forward.\n\nThe Transport minister said the Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (PRAZ) subjects all contracts to rigorous reviews which are also taken under consideration by an independent board, which verifies all approvals to ensure competency is given priority.The government is determined to ensure that only competent and reliable firms remain engaged on key projects because we prioritise service delivery.
