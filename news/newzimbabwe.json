Both the house and the vehicle have since been forfeited to the State.\n\nThe court said deterrent penalties in cases of insider fraud would serve justice.\n\nConvicted white-collar criminals will face stiff penalties and ill-got wealth will be forfeited, the National Prosecuting Authority said, commenting on the conviction.\n\n",
