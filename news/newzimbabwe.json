ZLHR further argues that the impugned provisions of the PVO Amendment Act were vague and badly drafted and contained arbitrary powers and over-regulation of PVOs, said ZLHR.\n\nZLHR also said the PVO Amendment Act has the effect of concentrating arbitrary powers in the Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare and the Registrars office and contains excessive executive interference in the internal affairs of PVOs.\n\nIt said the impugned provisions of the PVO Amendment Act have the net effect of effectively allowing the Executive to run PVOs and to deregister those that authorities dislike on very nebulous grounds.\n\nTo this end ZLHR is seeking a High Court order of constitutional invalidity, declaring section 4, section 5 as read with section 9(5), section 6, section 13A, section 14, and section 21, of the Private Voluntary Organisations Act (as amended by the PVO Amendment Act) to be ultra vires the Constitution and to be set aside.\n\n",
