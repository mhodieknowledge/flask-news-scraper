What is going on? Can I have an explanation from the Whips? Mudenda asked.\n\nZanu PF Chief Whip Pupurai Togarepi informed the Speaker that three committees were away.\n\nAs per your directive in this House, there should not be more than two Committees at a moment a week, but sometimes they just go without even advising the Whips. I am supposed to concur with those who arrange these outreaches. When I came in, I realised there were a few members only to be told that these committees would have gone out without my knowledge. We need to sit down with the administration to ensure that we protect attendance.\n\nResponding, Mudenda emphasised that parliamentary attendance must take precedence.\n\nWhile the public hearings are critical, and I do not know why they should arise after we have had public hearings on the Pre-Budget. There is no excuse why these committees should be out. Absolutely no excuse. The priority is for members to be here in the House as representatives of the people. You are the voice of the people who are not able to be in this august House.\n\nNow, if you are not there, how is their voice going to be heard? So, this must stop forthwith from next week. No committees should go out unless absolutely necessary.\n\nIn recent weeks, MPs have been making what observers describe as outrageous demands, claiming that their allowances are insufficient to meet their personal needs. Lawmakers earn extra money when travelling through additional allowances.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nCBZ Holdings, Zimbabwes largest financial services group by assets and deposits, has posted a 10% increase in profit after tax for the nine months ending 30 September 2025, reaching ZWG1.11 billion, up from ZWG1.01 billion in the same period last year.\n\nPresenting a trading update for the nine months ended 30 September 2025, CBZ Group Chief Legal Advisor and Governance, Rumbidzayi Jakanani, said the growth recorded comes as the countrys macroeconomic environment stabilises, with the ZWG holding steady against the US dollar and inflation easing into single digits.\n\nCBZ Group Chief Legal Advisor and Governance, Rumbidzayi Jakanani\n\nThe Group recorded a profit after tax of ZWG 1.11 billion, representing a 10% increase from ZWG1.01 billion recorded in the same period of the previous year. Total income amounted to ZWG4.23 billion, 58% above the ZWG 2.68 billion reported in the prior year, reflecting stable performance, she said.\n\nWhile the increase in profits may seem modest, it reflects CBZHs strong cost control and strategic diversification, as the bank navigates a period of monetary tightening and stable gold-backed reserves. This stability has allowed CBZH to focus on organic growth rather than hedge against extreme inflation volatility.\n\nTotal income surged 58% to ZWG 4.23 billion, up from ZWG 2.68 billion in 2024, with non-funded income contributing a significant 65% (ZWG 2.75 billion), reflecting a 54% increase year-on-year. This jump in non-interest income underscores CBZHs advantage in transactional banking, supported by its leading deposit base and robust digital channels, which have thrived amid growing electronic payment adoption and a stable exchange rate.\n\nFunded income also grew 66%, reaching ZWG 1.46 billion, as the bank selectively lent into higher-yielding sectors while maintaining strong asset quality, unlike some competitors who have struggled in volatile periods.\n\nThe balance sheet expanded 13% to ZWG 38.93 billion, with deposits rising by 25% to ZWG 27.09 billion. This strong growth in customer deposits has enabled CBZH to maintain a healthy loan-to-deposit ratio while maintaining high liquidity levels. The banks focus on stable, low-cost retail and corporate deposits has helped shield it from risks associated with short-term interbank funding.\n\nCapital adequacy remains strong, with all divisions meeting regulatory requirements. The bank is also planning fresh capital injections for its growth subsidiaries, positioning it for future opportunities in a fragmented market.\n\nLooking ahead, the global economy is expected to record moderate growth on the back of easing inflation, improving financial conditions, and technological productivity gains. The local economy is set to continue on the positive growth trajectory, supported by expected better rainfall season, higher prices for gold, improved energy supply, coupled with the ongoing fiscal reforms that will enhance the ease of doing business, added Jakanani.\n\n",

            "content": "By Fadzai Chipato, The Conversation\n\nCarbon offsetsare a way for companies or countries that pollute the air to cancel out some of their carbon emissions by funding projects that protect forests, plant trees, or provide clean energy  sometimes on the other side of the world. Polluting companies in the US, Europe, Asia or elsewhere can buy onecarbon creditfrom a green project anywhere in exchange for emitting one metric tonne of carbon dioxide (CO). But do these projects benefit the African countries that host them? Rural development researcher Fadzai Chipato studied two carbon offset projects in Zimbabwe.Her research foundthat these projects can negatively affect local communities.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, carbon offsetting began around 2011 with theKariba REDD+(reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries) project.\n\nIt was run by a Zimbabwean company,Carbon Green Africa, which leased 758,000 hectares of degraded forest from four local councils in northern Zimbabwe where forest could be regrown for the purpose of selling carbon credits.\n\nThe company aimed to work with local communities to halt deforestation throughconservation farming protecting the soil by not digging in it and planting a variety of crops. They also funded nutrition gardens and beekeeping projects, and providedbiogas digestersand fuel-efficient stoves to reduce the number of trees cut down for firewood.\n\nMany families benefited through food, education, and extra income. However, the projects were run from the top down. Decisions were made by investors, the government, and rural district councils. Local villagers had very little say.\n\nIn 2023, Zimbabwe passed anew carbon trading law. This required all carbon projects to be registered withthe governmentand pay 30% of revenues to the state. TheKariba REDD+was stopped, leaving villagersunsurewhether their gardens, beekeeping, and clean energy projects would continue.\n\nThe second project I studied is theCicada Holdings Project, which aimed to plant 100 million indigenous trees over 30 years and give out 120,000 cookstoves that use less firewood.\n\nUnlike Kariba, Cicada worked more closely with local farmers and by December 2025, it had given out 160,000 environmentally friendly stoves. However, it was also slowed down by the new law, with the government taking more than 18 months to process new registrations.\n\nOn the positive side,the Kariba projectset up 24 community gardens, including seven school gardens, that provided 3,000 people directly or indirectly with food. One garden generated enough income to support 10 orphans.\n\nThe community gardens have improved my familys quality of life. I managed to pay my daughters school fees and buy household supplies.\n\nNewconservation farmingmethods were introduced. Maize, and two nutritious crops that are fairly drought resistant  sorghum and millet  were grown. Beekeeping in the forests was also introduced. As farmers said:\n\nWe learned about innovative agriculture practices to improve our yields, which were low due to the low rainfall. We now experience better harvests, improving our food sustenance and even selling excess crops, generating financial income.\n\nBeyond forest preservation, beekeeping provides additional income for farmers and serves as a rich source of food for humans, thereby improving community livelihoods.\n\nThe Kariba REDD+ project also builtbiogas digestersat hospitals to generate clean energy from dung. Local villagers could sell cattle dung to these projects in exchange for medical treatments and cash.\n\nCicadas clean cookstoves reduced smoke-related illnesses and had other benefits:\n\nThe stoves are very helpful; we are no longer collecting firewood, which was getting difficult to find.\n\nOn the other hand,my research revealedthat many communities were excluded from decision-making. Some only found out about projects in their villages through the media. Local politicians were also unhappy when projects were put on ice after the new law introduced stringent registration requirements:\n\nWe were shocked when the project was stopped, saying the government was not involved. We asked ourselves, arent Rural District Councils part of the government?\n\nA further problem was that project funds went through many intermediary brokers, councils and non-governmental organisations. Villagers never knew how much money the carbon credits were generating or how it was spent. This lack of transparency caused mistrust.\n\nOverall,my research found thatcarbon offsets in Zimbabwe have not been neutral tools. They are political and economic processes that reshape who controls land, who benefits, and who is left out. Because they restrict traditional access to forests, firewood and grazing land, these projects create virtual dispossession.\n\nFor example, people were stopped from collecting firewood, grazing cattle, or making bricks in forest areas that had always been communal land. Women and youth who earned a living from the forests were badly affected by having fewer rights to use their land.\n\nThismirrorswider patterns across Africa, where communal land that supports households is redefined as underutilised and given over global carbon markets, often without fair consultation with the people using the land.\n\nTo make carbon offsetting fairer in Zimbabwe and the global south, several measures are needed:\n\nWithout these changes, carbon offsetting risks becoming another form of green grabbing that takes land and resources from Indigenous people who have used them for centuries in the name of climate change adaptation.\n\nLecturer in the Department of Sociology and Social Anthropology, Great Zimbabwe University\n\nThis article was originally published byThe Conversation.\n\n",
