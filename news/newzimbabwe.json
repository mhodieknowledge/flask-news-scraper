I feel very strong. I feel very powerful that Im doing all this work. But Im doing all this work while Im creating a baby, me and my man, were very supportive of each other, she said.\n\nCardi B said she and Diggs share the same ambition, each determined to be the greatest in their fields. She also credited Diggs with giving her a sense of stability as she readies her next album, Am I The Drama?, which includes a track called Safe.\n\nAnd he just makes me feel safe and very confident and very strong, she said. I mean, like, two weeks ago I was literally having a panic attack. I was, like, crying and crying and crying, just because I was just getting really nervous with you know, the whole album rollout  People were coming at me very hard. You know, sometimes people love you, people hate you. And people was just saying very mean things about me.\n\nShe admitted harsh criticism sometimes makes her question releasing music.\n\nAnd Im like, see, this is why I dont put music out, because its like, this is my art and this is something that I put a lotta love and time to. And its just like, sometimes, when people just rip it apart it just hurts you and it crushes you, she said.\n\nThrough it all, Cardi B  whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Almnzar  said Diggs support keeps her steady.\n\nHe makes me feel very confident And it makes you feel like you could take over the world.\n\nShe added that she waited to announce the pregnancy until she was able to close some deals first. She also admitted she has not yet told her parents, jokingly saying she is scared of them.\n\nCardi B, who shares three children with rapper Offset, said she was reluctant to fall in love again amid their high-profile divorce. But she recalled Diggs telling her: Let me heal you. Give me a chance for me to heal you.\n\nNow that pregnancy rumors are confirmed, Cardi B used her world-famous humor to ask fans to purchase her new album: Now yall could buy my album so I can buy Pampers and diapers and all that type of stuff. I told you. Now go support my album, cause Im a mother of four now.\n\nCardi B says her sophomore album feels complete.\n\nI feel like it touch every little thing that I want to touch.

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe 14th edition of the Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba (ZAMI) kicked off in Bulawayo on Tuesday, with participants urging government and industry players to embrace mining initiatives that place people and communities at the centre of resource exploitation.\n\nZimbabwe is endowed with vast mineral wealth, including platinum-group metals (PGMs), chrome, lithium, gold, coal, diamonds, nickel, copper, black granite, and asbestos, alongside potential resources such as iron ore, tungsten, and semi-precious stones. Yet, despite this vast mineral basket, the majority of Zimbabweans continue to face economic hardship.\n\nThe Borgen Project estimates that 60% of the population lives on less than US$3.65 a day, making Zimbabwe one of the poorest countries in the SADC region. Rural communities, home to about 67% of the population, remain most vulnerable to food insecurity, drought, and economic shocks. Meanwhile, the health sector continues to struggle, with 87% of Zimbabweans lacking medical aid coverage and persistent shortages of medicines, staff, and resources worsened by an ongoing brain drain.\n\nSpeaking at the event, Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC) Secretary General Wilfred Dimingu described mining in the country as a story of plunder rather than stewardship.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, we have witnessed rivers polluted, communities displaced, and workers exploited in the name of short-term gains. This is not stewardship. It is idolatry, worshipping mammon over the Creator. Theologically, we are called to a different path, he said.\n\nDimingu stressed that sustainable development must be rooted in justice and fairness.\n\nThis means harnessing Zimbabwes minerals, particularly those critical for renewable energy and battery technologies, not through voracious extraction that scars the land and sidelines the poor, but through operations that ensure equity and sustainability, he added.\n\nZandile Mvududu, a project officer at Silveira House, emphasised the need for collaboration in shaping the extractive sectors future.\n\nStakeholders must continue to dialogue, hinging on the faith-based approach which we encourage in the districts we work in. The coming Mines and Minerals Bill presents an opportunity for communities to give input and resolve legacy issues in the sector, she said.\n\nProfessor Tumai Murombo, a legal and environmental expert from the University of the Witwatersrand (South Africa), echoed calls for reform, urging a total overhaul of Zimbabwes minerals governance and environmental management framework.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has refused to throw out a lawsuit filed by the Presbytery of Zimbabwe of the Uniting Presbyterian Church in Southern Africa in a bitter dispute over the control and management of church-run schools.\n\nJustice Faith Mushure dismissed an application for absolution from the instance lodged by trustees of the Presbytery of Zimbabwe Education Trust, ruling that the matter had to proceed to full trial.\n\nThis is not an appropriate case to decree absolution from the instance, ruled Justice Mushure. I must assume that the evidence placed before me is true. There is evidence upon which a court, directing its mind reasonably to such evidence, could or might find for the plaintiff.\n\nThe church is challenging the validity of the trust that oversees its schools, accusing trustees of fraudulently registering it, mismanagement, and failing to account for funds. It is also seeking the trusts dissolution.\n\nCentral to the row are two deeds of trust allegedly registered under the same number in 2010 but with different founders  Reverends Paul Neshangwe and Wilbert Runyararo Sayimani. Both clergymen denied ever appearing before a notary to establish the trust, with Justice Mushure noting their testimonies raised prima facie irregularities.\n\nThe judge stressed that the trustees could not avoid scrutiny through legal technicalities.\n\nQuoting precedent, she said: A defendant who might be afraid to go into the witness box should not be permitted to shelter behind the procedure of absolution from the instance.\n\nThe case also raised red flags over school governance, with financial statements from 2013 to 2017 accounting for only three out of nine schools under the trust. Evidence was also led of trustees allegedly deriving personal benefits and parents expressing disquiet over mismanagement.\n\nRejecting the trustees argument that the church lacked authority to dissolve the trust, Justice Mushure noted: Under common law, the court has powers both to vary or terminate trusts in certain conditions  if the trust is being run contrary to the interests and objectives of the trust.\n\nThe trial is set to resume on September 25.\n\n",
