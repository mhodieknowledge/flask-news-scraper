            "content": "By IOL News\n\nTHE Western Cape Legislatures Standing Committee on Infrastructure was given a sobering and detailed account of the George building collapse during a live briefing on Friday.\n\nThe Garden Route District Municipality and the George Municipality reflected on the devastating event that claimed lives and injured many more.\n\nThe incident, which occurred just after 2pm on May 6, 2024, saw a multi-storey building under construction on Victoria Street collapse in what responders described as a rare pancake collapse, where floors fall directly atop one another.\n\nSpeaking at the briefing, Head of Disaster Management for the Garden Route District Municipality, Gerard Otto shared the agonising realities of the response operation.\n\nI dont think anything fully prepares you for an incident like this. Having the plan just makes the gap less of what you didnt plan for and what youve got planned.\n\nIt took 260 hours, from 6 to 17 May, for rescue teams to comb through the rubble, searching for survivors among 62 confirmed victims, most of whom were foreign nationals.\n\nOnly 16 of the deceased were South African citizens. The rest were Mozambican, Zimbabwean, Malawian, Lesotho nationals, some undocumented, Otto revealed.\n\nOne of the most remarkable moments came 118 hours into the rescue, when survivor Gabriel Gumba was pulled from the rubble virtually unharmed.\n\nThat lifted the spirit to say, Okay, lets carry on, lets do even more, said Otto.\n\nThe response involved more than a thousand personnel and volunteers, including specialised rescue technicians, emergency medical teams, construction workers, and canine units.\n\nHowever, the operation faced significant logistical and emotional challenges. Response equipment had to be transported from Worcester, resulting in delays of up to five hours for critical tools.\n\nAdditionally, language barriers complicated the provision of psychosocial support for victims, while inaccurate or missing records from contractors made it nearly impossible to track the workers involved.\n\nGeorge Municipality Fire Chief Neels Barnard described the moment he reached the scene.\n\nWas it just a structural collapse of one wall? Or was it the whole building? Its only when you reach the disaster site that you can see what has really happened. Even in the Western Cape, we have never experienced a tragedy of this scale before, said Barnard.\n\nCoordinated through a Multi-Agency Centre (MAC), the operation implemented triage colour-coding, acoustic detection devices, and forensic identification methods including tattoos and social media photos.\n\nNGOs, churches, and the Department of Social Development offered support to grieving families and rescue workers alike.\n\nThis was not just a government response, it was a whole-of-society approach, Otto said.\n\nOfficials also credited past disaster experiences, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2017 Knysna fires, for helping establish functional cluster systems.\n\nEveryone knew their roles, Otto added.\n\nThat intergovernmental coordination saved lives.\n\n",

            "content": "By BBC News\n\nLABORS Anthony Albanese has defied the so-called incumbency curse to be re-elected Australias prime minister in a landslide.\n\nOfficial vote counting wont finish for days, but Albaneses centre-left government will dramatically increase its majority after the conservative Liberal-National coalition suffered a thumping defeat nationwide.\n\nToday, the Australian people have voted for Australian values: for fairness, aspiration and opportunity for all; for the strength to show courage in adversity and kindness to those in need, Albanese said.\n\nCoalition leader Peter Dutton, who lost his own seat of 24 years, said he accepted full responsibility for his partys loss and apologised to his MPs.\n\nFollowing the result, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio both said they looked forward to deepening their bilateral relationships with Australia.\n\nCost-of-living concerns  particularly the affordability of healthcare and housing  dominated the five-week campaign, but international relations also reared its head, with the issue of how to deal with Donald Trump looming large over the election.\n\nDutton was seen by many as Australias Trump, which appeared to go down badly with voters, despite his attempts to shake off comparisons made between his policies on immigration, public sector cuts and China, and the Trump administration.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told BBC Newshour that Dutton ran a very Trumpian campaign, and the US president was the mood music that had a very big influence on how people perceived the Liberal-National opposition.\n\nLabor saw swings towards them right across the country  a rare feat for a second-term government in Australia  and Albanese becomes the first prime minister to win back-to-back elections in over 20 years.\n\nThe partys success has also tempered a trend of voters abandoning the two major parties, which was the big story of the last election in 2022.\n\nLabor is on track to finish with 86 seats, the Coalition about 40, and the Greens Party with one or two, according to projections by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Other minor parties and independents are ahead in nine seats.\n\nThat represents an increase of nine for Labor and a significant drop in support for the Greens. However most teal independents have been returned in their more conservative, inner-city electorates.\n\nIts a remarkable turnaround from the start of the year, when polling put Albaneses popularity at record lows after three years of global economic pain, tense national debate, and growing government dissatisfaction.\n\nAlbanese says his election was a vote for equality and kindess\n\nNuclear v renewables: The coal mining town caught in Australias climate wars\n\nIn his Saturday night victory speech, Albanese addressed some of the elections key issues, which also included migration, climate change and energy.\n\nHe reiterated his promises to make healthcare  most critically GP appointments  more affordable, put buying a house in reach for more Australians, and do more to address climate change and protect the environment.\n\nNotably, he also vowed to advance reconciliation for First Nations people: We will be a stronger nation when we Close the Gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.\n\nIts a veiled reference to the biggest moment of Albaneses tenure, the failed Voice referendum of October 2023, which sought to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution, and simultaneously establish a parliamentary advisory body for them.\n\nAustralia remains the only Commonwealth country to have never signed a treaty with its Indigenous people.\n\nSoul-searching after emphatic result\n\nThe Voice was one of Albaneses most defining policies, and his most striking setback  it was overwhelmingly rejected after months of often toxic and divisive national debate.\n\nIndigenous Australians have told the BBC they feel like theyve been forgotten by policymakers since.\n\nThe prime minister also found difficulty trying to walk a middle path on the Israel-Gaza war, raised eyebrows after buying a multi-million-dollar beach pad in the midst of a housing crisis and, like other leaders globally, he grappled with tough economic conditions.\n\nWith tanking poll numbers, Albanese was broadly seen as the underdog coming into the election, and was poised to be the next victim of the incumbency curse  a term to explain a global trend where struggling constituents were turfing out governments after a single term.\n\nDutton, on the other hand, looked like he was writing a great political comeback  he was on the edge of bringing his party from its worst loss in 70 years back into office in a single term.\n\nIt has been almost a century since a first-term government has failed to win re-election, but as Australian National University Emeritus Professor John Warhurst said: Dutton entered the campaign [year] in front. It was his to lose.\n\nInstead, Dutton has overseen a party loss so emphatic he has lost his own electorate of Dickson, to Labors Ali France.\n\nI love this country and have fought hard for it, he told supporters in Brisbane, conceding defeat.\n\nWe have been defined by our opponents in this election which is not a true story of who we are, but we will rebuild from here and we will do that because we know our values, we know our beliefs, and we will always stick to them.\n\nHis campaign was marred by unforced errors: including a series of policy backflips which caused confusion, awkward mistakes on important issues like cost of living and, perhaps most memorably, accidentally booting an AFL ball into a cameramans head.\n\nThe opposition has been shambolic, Prof Warhurst says.\n\nBut the government  while resolute and disciplined in its campaign  was timid. Its strategy was largely allowing voters to judge Dutton and his party, rather than advancing bold or convincing policies, analysts say.\n\nAnd thats something we heard from voters throughout the campaign too.\n\nWhile the Coalition turns to licking its wounds and choosing its next leader, it will again have to reckon with its direction.\n\nLast election, analysts and some of the partys own MPs cautioned against a move towards the right. They questioned whether Dutton  a polarising figure considered by many to be a conservative hard man  was the right person to rebuild support, particularly in the moderate areas where they lost a lot of it.\n\nAfter a campaign which in its dying days ventured into culture war territory and what some say are Trumpian politics, the Coalition is going to have to ask those questions again  and if they want to be competitive, perhaps find different answers.\n\nWe have to stop drinking the Kool-Aid from the fire hose and we need to have a serious review we delude ourselves that we are just a few tactical devices away from winning an election, former Liberal strategist Tony Barry told the ABC.\n\nBut meanwhile Labor has to decide what it wants to achieve with the large mandate Australia has handed them.\n\nAlbaneses incumbency curse turned out to be a gift, with international uncertainty appearing to have swayed voters in countries like Canada away from change. Likewise, Australia voted for stability.\n\nLabor struck a middle-of-the-road path with its a policy platform, but can now afford to be braver, says Amy Remeikis, chief politicial analyst at the Australia Institute think tank.\n\nThat was the path that they took to the election, and that is what they are seeing has paid dividends for them. But the question now is: Will Labor actually do something with power?'\n\n",

            "content": "By The Eastleigh Voice\n\nFOUR filmmakers connected to the explosive BBC documentary, Blood Parliament, have been arrested in Nairobi, amid mounting controversy over the governments handling of police killings during last years protests, which were mainly led by Gen Z demonstrators, some of whom were killed by police.\n\nThe filmmakers, Chris Wamae, Nicholas Gichuki, Brian Adagala and Mark Karubiu, were taken into custody early Saturday morning from their studio in Karen.\n\nThe four men are currently being held at Muthaiga and Pangani police stations.\n\nThe arrest follows the release of a 40-minute documentary by BBC Africa Eye, which investigates the killing of peaceful protesters during anti-tax demonstrations outside Parliament in June 2024.\n\nThe film focuses particularly on the death of Eric Shieni, a finance student at the University of Nairobi, who was shot as he was leaving the protest.\n\nIn its documentary, BBC Africa Eye claimed to have reviewed over 150 images and videos taken before and after Shienis death.\n\nThe network said its investigation identified the officer responsible for the killing, who they say is a member of Kenyas armed forces. However, the officers identity has not been officially confirmed, and the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) has denied any involvement.\n\nThe documentary has generated a significant public outcry, raising questions about the use of force by the Kenyan security forces during the protest.\n\nCritics have demanded accountability for those responsible for the deaths and injuries of unarmed protesters.\n\nOn Monday, Kenyan officials blocked a public screening of the documentary, a move that many view as an attempt to silence the investigation and prevent further scrutiny. BBC confirmed that the screening was abruptly cancelled after intervention by local authorities.\n\nThe screening was stopped at the last minute under pressure from the government, the BBC said in a statement.\n\nThis action appears to be an effort to prevent the public from viewing the documentary and its contents.\n\nThe arrest of the filmmakers is seen as part of a broader effort by the government to suppress information related to police misconduct during the protests.\n\nHuman rights organisations have condemned the arrests, calling them an attack on free speech and press freedom.\n\nThe incident has sparked fears of increased government control over the media, especially regarding sensitive political topics.\n\nMany journalists and filmmakers working on politically sensitive stories have expressed concerns about facing similar reprisals.\n\nThe Blood Parliament documentary has put the spotlight on the issue of police violence during the June 2024 protests, which saw dozens of people killed or injured.\n\nAlthough the government has pledged to investigate the deaths, there have been no significant actions taken to hold security officers accountable for the killings.\n\n",
