            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFormer leader of the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), Nelson Chamisa, has revealed that his departure from both the CCC and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), was a calculated move aimed at frustrating President Emmerson Mnangagwa, whom he accuses of orchestrating a takeover of the opposition parties.\n\nChamisa resigned as leader of the CCC in January last year, citing the hijacking of his party by Mnangagwa as punishment for his refusal to accept the results of the chaotic August 2023 general elections.\n\nThe fallout from the elections saw Sengezo Tshabangu emerge, seemingly from nowhere, claiming to be the interim Secretary General of the CCC.\n\nTshabangus stated aim was to restore order within the opposition by addressing alleged irregularities in the candidate selection process leading up to the 2023 elections.\n\nTshabangu subsequently initiated a widespread recall of elected representatives, claiming that certain candidates had been improperly selected.\n\nThis led to the unprecedented recall of over 40 MPs and councillors, effectively handing Zanu-PF back the two-thirds parliamentary majority it had failed to secure during the harmonised elections.\n\nChamisas attempts to prevent these recalls, including written appeals to the then Local Government Minister July Moyo and Speaker of the National Assembly Jacob Mudenda, proved futile. The courts upheld the recalls, leaving Chamisa with no option but to step aside.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Thursday, Chamisa confirmed that his decision to leave the CCC was motivated by a desire to spite Mnangagwa.\n\nThe best decision I ever made in my leadership journey was to walk away from MDC & CCC. You will thank me later. I had to break the cycle of going in circles. And that was my best way to teach ED a lesson!, Chamisa declared.\n\nThis was not Chamisas first departure from a major political entity. He had previously walked away from the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) after a Supreme Court ruling questioned the legitimacy of his assumption of the party leadership following the death of Morgan Tsvangirai.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nThe US has deported five people who it described as criminal illegal aliens to the southern African kingdom of Eswatini.\n\nOn board the flight were five deportees from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Cuba and Yemen who have been convicted of crimes ranging from child rape to murder, US Homeland Security Department Assistant Secretary Tricia McLaughlinsaid in an online post.\n\nThis flight took individuals so uniquely barbaric that their home countries refused to take them back, McLaughlin wrote on X.\n\nEswatini, the last absolute monarchy in Africa, said it acknowledged widespread concern within the country regarding the deportations.\n\nFive inmates are currently housed in our correctional facilities in isolated units, where similar offenders are kept. The nation is assured that these inmates pose no threat to the country or its citizens, government spokesperson Thabile Mdluli said in a statement.\n\nEswatini and the US will work with the United Nations immigration agency to facilitate the transit of the deportees to their country of origin, Mdluli added.\n\nEarlier this month, the USsent eight migrants from several countries to South Sudanafter a court lifted restrictions on sending people to countries where they have no ties.\n\nIn a series of posts on the X social media platform, McLaughlin listed the crimes the five deported to Eswatini had been convicted of, describing them as depraved monsters who had been terrorizing American communities.\n\nA safe third country deportation flight to Eswatini in Southern Africa has landed, she said, adding: They are off of American soil.\n\nThe Eswatini government declined to say whether any payments were made as part of the arrangement.\n\nThe US is the fourth largest market for the countrys biggest export, sugar. Analysts suggest that Eswatini may be trying to safeguard this trade and avoid the imposition of tariffs.\n\nA pro-democracy group, the Swazi Solidarity Network, has condemned the deal as deplorable.\n\nSpokesperson Lucky Lukhele told the BBC that Eswatini must not become a dumping ground for criminals, and that citizens needed protection.\n\nThe news has sparked public concern over whether local prisons are equipped to securely house such inmates.\n\nPreviously known as Swaziland, Eswatini is a small, landlocked country that is surrounded by South Africa and Mozambique. It has been led by King Mswati III since 1986.\n\nLast month, the US Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their own.\n\nRwanda has confirmed discussions have taken place, while Benin, Angola, Equatorial Guinea and Moldova have also been named in media reports as potential recipient countries.\n\nTrumps administration has already deported people to El Salvadorand Costa Rica.\n\nSouth Sudan recently agreed to hold eight men deported from the US and said they were not in handcuffs and appeared to be in good condition.\n\nThe war-torn country said the deportees were kept in a civilian facility in the capital Juba, under the watch of police and the national security service. Only one of them is from South Sudan.\n\nIn April, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio revoked all visas for South Sudanese passport holders blaming the country for failing to accept the return of its repatriated citizens in a timely manner.\n\nIt is not clear if that has now changed.\n\nLast week, Nigeria said it would not bow to pressure from the Trump administration to accept Venezuelan deportees or third-country prisoners from the US.\n\nPresident Donald Trumps pledge to conduct mass deportations was a centrepiece of his election campaign and an issue on which he drew widespread support, including many Hispanic voters.\n\nHe said he wanted to deport people living in the US illegally but White House efforts have been much broader in scope  taking aim at people in the US on student visas, suspending admissions of refugees except white South Africans, and moving to revoke temporary work permits and other protections that had been granted to immigrants by previous presidents.\n\nTo crack down on immigrants, Trumps administration has resumed raids at workplaces, a tactic that had been suspended under his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\n",
