The central bank was forced to swallow the bitter pill after intervening by unilaterallydeclaring a 43% devaluation rate in a bid to align with realistic market trends.\n\nHowever, inflationary rates published by the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (Zimstat) last month indicated that the countrys safe-haven, the US$ endured severe inflation blows after the year-on-year US$ inflation rate for January 2025 jumped to 14.6%, thereby gaining 12,1% from a rate of 2,5% in December 2024.\n\nAgainst the background, double-digit USD inflation under a highly dollarized environment is a cause for concern, as prices are generally expected to be stable in USD terms, the industry grouping inflation tracker said.\n\nRecords show that US$ inflation rate has been stable since January 2021 with current trends departing from the years long gains.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, US$ inflation is normally a response to ZWG inflation, as retailers adjust their prices in line with ZWG prices to avoid being accused by the RBZs Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for using the parallel market rates, the CZI analysis said.\n\nThe US$ month-on-month inflation began the year at a higher rate of about 11,5% for January 2025, which is an all-time high rate over the past four years.\n\n",

It could be a classic case of hoist by his own petard.\n\nMafume, it seems, has transformed his residential pad into a hostel, a commercial venture that blatantly ignores council rules. He has admitted the foul play  neglecting to apply for a change of use permit.\n\nDuring his commission testimony, Wadarwa appeared like a rabbit caught in the headlights, completely floundering when quizzed about his inspection of Mafumes property.\n\nThe commission grilled Wadarwa relentlessly, demanding an explanation for how he greenlighted the inspection on a building that did not match the plans.\n\nWhy were you signing for developments which are not in accordance with the plan? lead evidence Tapiwa Fresh Godzi pressed.\n\nWadarwa replied, To me, its normal that I sign and then recommend that changes are made.\n\nWhen pushed further, he stammered, It was an error on my part, Sir. An error repeated six times, apparently, each one carefully signed off on  queried Justice Cheda.\n\nWadarwa claims he was pressured by his boss and dashed through the process, forging dates as he signed off on all six approvals in a single day. The commission then inquired about Wadarwas remedy to his mistakes.\n\nI will advise the owner of the property to demolish the alterations made to his property and revert to the original approved plan. I will write a letter to my seniors informing them about this, he said.\n\nMafume, despite admitting to bending the rules, is clinging to the hope of regularisation  relying on a loophole in the by-laws.\n\nBut City of Harare Urban Planning Acting Director Samuel Nyabeza said it is not possible. He branded the inspection signatures on Mafumes property plan as highly suspicious, noting the impossibility of such frequent inspections.\n\nNyabeza also insisted that Mafume must rectify his error by returning the property to its original residential status.\n\nMafume is understood to have jetted out of the country but will be back next week to face the commission.\n\n",

However, we have anecdotal evidence. Millions are paid out, duplicate payments are made, and some ratepayers fees are waived.\n\nWe could be looking at losses of around US$10 million per year. The City Council has been haemorrhaging funds, said Mafume.\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of Quill Associates, which had been supplying the City Council with a billing system, the municipality implemented SAGE, a system riddled with inefficiencies.\n\nThis has resulted in the City Council being unable to account for a significant amount of money, which Parliament in 2022 suggested could amount to billions.\n\nHarare City Council has failed to audit its accounts for over five years, raising serious concerns about corporate governance at the Town House.\n\nAccording to Mafume, top officials at the City Council have formed a corruption cartel, profiting from the chaos.\n\nLast year Mafume revealed that as a result of the lack of ERP, more than 100,000 households are not in the system of the Council, shortchanging the local government.\n\nMafume also claimed that the Harare City Council Executive has been obstructing his efforts to implement a functional ERP system.\n\nI have tried everything to get an ERP system installed at the Council. I end up being accused of interference, but I have done everything humanly possible to get an ERP in place. We cannot function without an ERP.\n\nThis is a deliberate act by our procurement department and management. They do not want an ERP system implemented, said Mafume\n\n",

Zimbabwean exporters and other businesses argue that all their inputs and working capital is in US dollars.\n\nThe Horticultural Development Council said lowering of the forex retention threshold from 70% to 75% presents significant challenges for the horticulture sector that relies heavily on foreign currency earnings to sustain production.\n\nUnder the forex retention policy, exporters in Zimbabwe get 75% of their earnings in foreign currency while 25% is paid out in the local currency equivalent at the official exchange rate that often trails the thriving parallel exchange rate.\n\nThe horticulture industry operates within tight cost margins, with most inputssuch as power, fuel, seed, fertilisers, packaging, and freightdenominated in US dollars, said Linda Nielsen, CEO of HDC.\n\nThe reduction in forex retention means exporters will have less hard currency to meet these critical expenses, placing strain on cash flow and investment in the sector.\n\nZimbabwean retailers have been among the most affected by the countrys currency uncertainty, with many wholesale and retail companies folding up, rationalising operations and destocking.\n\nThe Confederation of Zimbabwe Retailers said over the weekend that the reduction of the foreign currency retention threshold posed challenges for the retail and wholesale sector in terms of supply chain stability and pricing.\n\nExporters, who also supply goods to local formal retailers and wholesalers, rely heavily on foreign currency for key inputs in their various fields, said Denford Mutashu, head of the Zimbabwe retailers grouping.\n\nWith reduced forex retention, these exporters may struggle to meet their USD-denominated expenses, leading to higher production costs and possibly further dollarising supply chains.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nI want to play their favourite song but you know they love to sue, said Kendrick Lamar, a couple of minutes into his Super Bowl half-time show.\n\nEveryone knew what he was referring to. Not Like Us, his brutal takedown of rap rival Drake, was one of last years breakout hits, earning one billion streams on Spotify and five Grammy Awards, including song of the year.\n\nBut there were questions over whether Lamar would play it  or even could play it  at the Super Bowl, afterDrake filed a defamation lawsuitfor lyrics that branded him a sexual predator, which he denies.\n\nLamar leaned into the dilemma, teasing the song over and over during his set, before finally giving the audience what they wanted.\n\nWhen the song finally played, Kendrick self-censored the most contentious lyric, in which he calls Drake a certified paedophile.\n\nBut he looked directly into the camera with a mischievous grin as he called out Drakes name; and left intact the songs notorious double-entendre: Tryin to strike a chord and its probablyA minor.\n\nThat lyric echoed around the Caesars Superdome in Louisiana, indicating that no amount of legal action could ever hope to diminish the songs popularity.\n\nIn playing it, Lamar was expected to have reached more than 120 million TV viewers who had tuned in to see the game in which thePhiladelphia Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22to deny them an unprecedented third straight Super Bowl.\n\nThe performance was further heightened by the surprise appearance of tennis star Serena Williams, who performed the Crip Walk  a notorious Los Angeles dance move  as Lamar prowled the stage.\n\nDrakes lawyers are suing Lamars record label Universal Music Group over the track, accusing it of trying to create a viral hit out of a song that made false factual allegations about the star.\n\nGetty Images Serena Williams was the only unannounced guest star during the set\n\nSunday marked the first time that a solo rapper had headlined the Super Bowl, and Lamar brought an elaborate stage show, full of dancers, fireworks and special guests.\n\nBut the rappers lyrics have always explored the contradictions between ego and self-doubt, and his Super Bowl set put that conflict in the spotlight.\n\nHe performed on a giant noughts and crosses board, flipping between introspective deep cuts (typically staged inside the Xs) and crowd-pleasing chart hits (which took place in the Os).\n\nActor Samuel L Jackson, dressed as Uncle Sam, acted as emcee  berating Lamar when he became too self-indulgent, and praising his duets with R&B singer SZA.\n\nThats what Im talking about, Jackson said, after the duo performed All The Stars, a ballad from the soundtrack to Marvels Black Panther movie.\n\nThats what America wants, nice and calm.\n\nGetty Images Kendrick arrived on stage atop a black Buick GNX car  the same model his father drove home from hospital after he was born in 1987\n\nBut whatever Lamar performed, the energy was electrifying.\n\nEarly highlights included Humble and DNA, both taken from the rappers Pulitzer Prize-winning album DAMN, and whose tectonic beats rattled around the stadium.\n\nThe set,which is available to watch on YouTube, also included Squabble Up, Man At The Garden and another Drake diss track, Euphoria.\n\nUnlike most Super Bowl performers, Lamar isnt much of a mover, but he had a charismatic swagger as he walked in step with his dancers; and clever staging gave the show momentum  especially on nervy, angular tracks like Peekaboo.\n\nSZA also gave the set a lift, with supple vocals and improbably flexible choreography that helped soften Lamars edgier instincts.\n\nGetty Images SZA and Lamar have been frequent collaborators, appearing on each others albums since 2017\n\nReuters Samuel L Jackson was the ringleader of Lamars elaborate Super Bowl set\n\nNot Like Us was the undoubted climax, but Lamar took a victory lap on the bouncy West Coast anthem TV Off, where he boasted, yeah, somebody gotta do it.\n\nHe was joined on stage by the songs producer, Mustard, who clutched a football while sporting the worlds baggiest jeans  before Lamar pointed an imaginary remote control at the camera and intoned, Game Over.\n\nFor fans, it was a powerful performance, full of Easter eggs  including a snippet of the unreleased song Bodies.\n\nCasual viewers might have agreed more with Samuel L Jacksons plea for Lamar to keep it light; especially as some of his more densely-written lyrics were rendered unintelligible by the stadiums cavernous echo.\n\nAnd it was noticeable that Lamar omitted to play his civil rights anthem Alright, in a year where the NFL chose to remove the phrase end racism from the end zone of the football field.\n\nThe phrase had been present at the Super Bowl since 2020, amid the Black Lives Matter protests  for which Alright had become the unofficial soundtrack.\n\nMany had expected Lamar to make a bigger statement, especially with President Donald Trump in attendance, but the stars performance remained resolutely uncontroversial  unless, of course, your name is Drake.\n\nGetty Images A protester unveiled a flag during Not Like Us\n\nNonetheless, Lamars show was sleek and streamlined  as many fans had expected, afteraudio of the backing track leakedon Thursday.\n\nThe only interruption came at the climax of the 13-minute set, when a protester climbed on top of Lamars black Buick GNX car and unfurled a combined Palestinian and Sudanese flag, before being tackled by security officers.\n\nThe NFL later said in a statement that the protester was part of the 400-member cast who took part in the show.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe career-spanning set crammed 11 songs into 13 minutes. Heres what Kendrick played.\n\nReuters Taylor Swift was there to support her boyfriend Travis Kelce, whose team were in the final for the third consecutive year\n\nBefore the show, it had been rumoured that Taylor Swift might swoop down from her VIP suite to join Lamar on stage.\n\nThe pair duetted on a remix of her single Bad Blood in 2015  and fans hoped they might perform it live for the first time at the Super Bowl.\n\nIn the end, Swift opted just to watch the show, along with other celebrity attendees including Paul McCartney, Stormzy, Lady Gaga, Jay-Z, Ice Spice, Doechii, Paul Rudd, Bradley Cooper and Winnie Harlow.\n\nMaybe it was for the best: Some reports suggested that Swift had been booed at the stadium, where almost 80% of fans supported the Philadelphia Eagles, rather than her boyfriend Travis Kelces team.\n\nFox Lady Gaga taped her segment earlier in the week\n\nBefore kick-off, Lady Gaga made a surprise appearance on Bourbon Street, in the middle of New Orleans historic French Quarter.\n\nThe star, who played her own Super Bowl half-time show in 2017, played a touching rendition of her song Hold My Hand, honouring the victims of the New Years Day terror attack that claimed the lives of 14 people in the city.\n\nGaga was surrounded by first responders as she played a black baby grand piano in the middle of the road.\n\nHere on Bourbon Street, always the heart and soul of New Orleans, this year began with a terror attack that tried to shatter its spirit, said former American footballer Michael Strahan during the pre-filmed segment.\n\nBut the resilience of New Orleans is matched by the resolve of our country.\n\nGetty Images Jon Batiste became the first musician to perform the US National Anthem at the Super Bowl in front of a sitting president\n\nMusical performances before the game also included R&B artist Ledisi, who performed Lift Every Voice and Sing, often referred to as the Black National anthem, joined by 125 youth choir members.\n\nMusician Troy Andrews, popularly known as Trombone Shorty, and Christian singer-songwriter Lauren Daigle played America the Beautiful  giving the track a feel-good New Orleans vibe.\n\nAnd just before the game began, New Orleans native Jon Batiste sang the American National Anthem, adding a few jazz flourishes from his multi-coloured grand piano.\n\n",

The three players that we brought in this window, they are strong  physically strong, and they can add a lot. They can help us a lot in this long season that we have to face.\n\nIt was a positive debut for Munetsi against Blackburn and fans will hope he can soon push the likes of Gomes, Andre and Bellegarde for a starting spot.\n\nHe looks like he will add physicality for Wolves, but clearly, he does also have an eye for goal as well, and Pereira looked like he wanted to take advantage of Munetsis attacking prowess against Blackburn.\n\nThe star has come from the same team as Emmanuel Agbadou, and fans will hope Munetsi can have a similar impact to that of the Ivorian.\n\nAll of a sudden, this Wolves squad feels much more competitive, and hopefully, the second half of the season will be radically different to the first.\n\n",

            "content": "By VOA\n\nHARARE  At dawn, 65-year-old Nelly Mutandwa swapped her pajamas for leggings, a T-shirt and sneakers. She grabbed a bottle of water before heading to an unconventional workout spot: a cemetery in Zimbabwes capital, Harare.\n\nSurrounded by rows of graves, she joined other members of the Commandos Fitness Club in an hour-long session of squats, lunges and stretches as upbeat music blared. For Mutandwa, the daily routine is more than exercise. Its her lifeline in managing diabetes.\n\nThey are resting, she said, pointing to the graves. I just dont want to join them yet. That means I have to do the hard work here.\n\nWith limited fitness facilities such as gyms in their neighborhoods, older Zimbabweans are exercising wherever they can to combat Africas growing problem of non-communicable diseases like heart problems, high blood pressure and diabetes. Other groups exercise along highways or disused railway lines.\n\nGlobally, non-communicable diseases, which are conditions that cannot be directly passed from person to person, are the leading cause of death, responsible for 41 million, or 74%, of annual fatalities, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nNon-communicable diseases currently account for about 40% of deaths annually in Zimbabwe, according to its ministry of health and child care.\n\nIn Zimbabwe and the rest of sub-Saharan Africa, non-communicable diseases are set to overtake communicable diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, malaria and cholera as the leading cause of death or illness by 2030, according to WHO.\n\nPreviously associated with older people, non-communicable diseases are increasingly spreading to children and young adults due to smoking, frequent alcohol use, unhealthy diets and lack of physical activity.\n\nThis has sparked huge concern among experts and governments on a continent that is experiencing the worlds fastest population growth and is home to its youngest population.\n\nDr. Johannes Marisa, a public health specialist in Harare and president of the Medical and Dental Private Practitioners of Zimbabwe Association, said doctors are witnessing a rapid change as more children and young people are diagnosed with NCDs.\n\nHe attributed it partly to sedentary lifestyles as many people spend much of their time glued to their smartphone screens at the expense of physical movement, as well as growing substance abuse and unhealthy diets.\n\nWhile climate change-induced droughts have left many rural people in Zimbabwe scrounging for food, traders in urban areas are racing to get a piece of the fast food market thats widely blamed for obesity.\n\nIn Harare and other urban areas, franchises such as KFC compete with a mushrooming number of cheaper local restaurants and informal roadside stalls, public markets and even homes where one can grab a fried piece of chicken, a burger or a fries-and-sausage combo for a dollar.\n\nIn response, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube in the 2025 national budget imposed a modest 0.5% tax on sales of doughnuts and other foods including tacos, pizza, hot dogs, shawarma, fries, chicken and burgers by retailers to encourage healthier dietary choices and mitigate the prevalence of non-communicable diseases.\n\nMeanwhile, some older Zimbabweans are taking up physical exercise.\n\nFor Mutandwa and her Commandos Fitness Club crew, the surroundings of the cemetery suffice. Coached by Joseph Nekati, whose mothers stroke in 2023 inspired him to help others, the free club has become a sanctuary for older fitness buffs. Eight of the clubs roughly 20 members are older people, Nekati said.\n\nI weighed 86 kilograms (189 pounds) and struggled to stand up. I would struggle to breathe just walking in my house. Now, Im down to 76 kilograms (167 pounds) and I can walk long distances, said Susan Gomo, a 64-year-old grandmother managing high blood pressure and arthritis.\n\nThe group exercise is also meant to encourage other older people to work out. Some of my age mates are reluctant, Gomo said. They end up just eating and sitting at home. They might change their minds when they see me in great shape.\n\nMutandwa said she picked up the habit of power walks when she visited her daughter in the United Kingdom in 2022. She decided to try it back home in Zimbabwe, but the roads in her township were potholed and crowded. She went for solo walks on a nearby hill, but she felt unsafe.\n\nLast year, she noticed the fitness club in the cemetery, where a wide and well-maintained path provides a convenient workout spot. With three of her neighbors, she approached the coach, who happily took them in.\n\nNow the cemetery has come to symbolize Mutandwa and others quest to live healthier and outpace death  one step at a time.\n\nIts serene, its safe and we have a lot of space with minimal disturbances. Hopefully the (local) council can build proper facilities for us, she said, preparing to stroll back home.\n\n",
