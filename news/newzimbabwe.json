            "content": "By CNN\n\nUNITED States federal prosecutors added two additional criminal charges against music mogul Sean Diddy Combs, one month before he is set to go to trial in New York on sex trafficking charges.\n\nProsecutors charged Combs with one additional count of sex trafficking and one additional count of transportation to engage in prostitution relating to Victim-2, according to a superseding indictment filed Friday. Authorities allege that conduct occurred between 2021 and 2024.\n\nCombs was previously charged with racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution related to three victims and one count of sex trafficking related only to Victim-1. He now faces five federal charges.\n\nJury selection for his trial is scheduled to start on May 5. Combs has pleaded not guilty.\n\nWhen reached for comment, lawyers for Combs said, These are not new allegations or new accusers. These are the same individuals, former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships. This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion.\n\nThey allege Combs and his associates used his position of power to coerce women, often under the pretense of a romantic relationship, into engaging in sex acts, according to the indictment.\n\nProsecutors said during these encounters, known as Freak Offs, women were drugged and forced to have sex with male prostitutes. The Freaks Offs often lasted days and were video recorded, the indictment alleges.\n\nCombs lawyers have maintained no crimes were committed and the sexual encounters were consensual and part of a long-term relationship.\n\nCombs is also accused of reacting violently when his authority was threatened. On one occasion, the indictment says, Combs allegedly dangled a victim over an apartment balcony and was involved in kidnapping and arson.\n\nProsecutors also revealed in a new court filing that four accusers are expected to testify at the trial.\n\nVictim-1, who was Combs long-term girlfriend, is planning to testify under her real name. Prosecutors have asked that three other alleged victims be allowed to testify under pseudonyms.\n\nThis case has already received an exceptional amount of media coverage, which will presumably only increase as trial proceeds. Permitting these measures will prevent unnecessary public disclosure of the victims identities, and the harassment from the media and others, they wrote in a court filing Friday.\n\nIn addition, prosecutors said, publicizing the names of these three victims will cause them significant embarrassment, anxiety, and social stigma. The accusers have said they are concerned that their testimony would impact their personal relationships and future employment, the government said.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the accusers identities are known to Combs and his lawyers.\n\nJudges have allowed accusers to testify using nicknames or pseudonyms in other high-profile cases, including the sex trafficking trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epsteins former girlfriend and accomplice.\n\n",

And guess when it happened? When those kids were little.\n\nWhen asked about Michelles comments, Barack told CBS Mornings: Let me just say this: it sure helps to be out of the White House. And to have a little more time with her.\n\nMichelle  when our girls were growing up, that was priority number one, two, three and four. And so, I did not fully appreciate, I think, as engaged of a father as I was, the degree of stress and tension for her, knowing that not just me and Michelle were under scrutiny and in this strange environment, but that we were raising our daughters in a kind of situation that just wasnt normal.\n\nMichelle met Barack in 1989 when she was 25 and he was 28, while both were working at the Sidley Austin LLP law firm in Chicago.\n\nThe former president asked Michelle on a date within a month of meeting, and they became engaged in 1991.\n\nThey married the following year and later had two daughters, Malia in 1998 and Sasha in 2001.\n\nBaracks political career began in earnest in 2004 when he was elected as an Illinois state senator, bringing the family into the public eye.\n\nIn 2008, he was elected the 44th president of the United States and won re-election in 2012.\n\n",

However, time and again, the government has been its own worst enemy, shooting itself in the foot with policies and practices that deter investors.\n\nNvidias supercomputers, powered by graphic processing units, or GPUs (the workhorse chips behind AI), will be deployed at Cassavas data centres in South Africa from as early as June, with plans to roll them out across the companys other facilities in Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, and Nigeria.\n\nThis is a clear indication that, where AI development is concerned, South Africa will be punching above its weight in the coming years.\n\nSpeaking in Kigali, Rwanda, at the Inaugural Global AI Summit on Africa, Masiyiwa was blunt about his reasons for side-lining Zimbabwe and other African nations due to their less-than-stellar business environments.\n\nMasiyiwa emphasised the need for African leaders to cultivate a pro-investor ecosystem.\n\nI cannot overemphasise the need for our leaders to create an ecosystem for investment because people like me stepping forward and going out to raise billions of dollars to buy these chips, we can only go to where it is investor friendly, he said.\n\nHe added, underlining his point with a stark warning: We wont come back and tell you your investment environment doesnt work. We just walk away. So, weve got to talk to each other. Youve got to listen to what we feel we need to comfortably raise the capital to do this.\n\nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) Minister Tatenda Mavetera acknowledged the uphill battle in creating a favourable business climate that attracts investment, particularly in the ICT sector.\n\nOur ministry is prioritising: Streamlining regulations to fast-track tech infrastructure projects, Incentivising R&D (research and development) partnerships and private-sector co-investment and building secure digital ecosystems with reliable power, connectivity and talent pipelines, Mavetera posted on her X account Saturday.\n\nShe added: More investor friendly policies in the ICT sector are essential and urgent. Lets deepen this dialogue.\n\nWe are working on a lot of policies e.g ICT start up and venture capital policy, fintech and cryptocurrency policy and also look at implementing tax incentives in the ICT sector so that we position Zimbabwe as the next tech hub, Mavetera further wrote.\n\nMasiyiwa famously navigated a hostile environment in the 1990s to establish Econet Wireless and has publicly thanked the late Vice President Joshua Nkomo for his support in founding Econet.\n\nMnangagwas critics were quick to accuse the Zanu-PF leader of a monumental blunder.\n\nMasiyiwas decision to establish the AI factory in South Africa has been interpreted by many as an own goal that has left Zimbabwe in the digital doldrums.\n\n",

            "content": "By Bloomberg\n\nA LIQUIDITY crunch in Zimbabwe is deepening the economys embrace of the US dollar and undermining the bullion-backed currency introduced by the government almost a year ago.\n\nThe ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, which began trading on April 8, is the southern African nations sixth attempt since 2009 at replacing the dollar with a functional local currency. It has not gone well.\n\nIn September, after persistent weakness against the dollar, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe devalued the ZiG by 43%, raised the key interest rate to 35% from 20% and increased cash reserve requirements to steady the currency. It has depreciated almost 4% this year.\n\nThe stability measures have led to an economy swimming in dollars, said Eddie Cross, a Harare-based independent economist and former monetary policy committee member.\n\nThe liquidity crunch has now killed the ZiG, he said.\n\nThe ZiG has retreated as a currency of trade and effectively we have dollarized.\n\nThe tight monetary policy stance has fuelled a slump with stocks plunging on Harares main exchange, consumer prices falling 0.1% in March and ZiG supply scant on the unofficial market.\n\nThe ZiG is being used to settle mostly minor transactions including utility and tax payments and a portion of civil servant wages. The rest is paid in dollars. The currency cannot be used to pay for essentials including fuel, rent and medicines.\n\nThe highest denomination ZiG banknote is worth about $7.50  enough to buy six loaves of bread.\n\nDespite being backed by more than $550 million in gold and cash reserves, used as a selling point to win public trust, its limited use in salient sectors of the economy makes differences with its failed predecessors seem cosmetic, said Jacques Nel, head of Africa macro at Oxford Economics.\n\nIt would have taken something special to convince Zimbabweans that this time is different, he said.\n\nBumpy ride\n\nNot even the more than 30% surge in the bullion price since the gold-backed currencys adoption has helped.\n\nPart of the problem is that the level of hard currency reserves backing it are woefully inadequate, because the nation has been locked out of capital markets since a debt default in 1999, said Hasnain Malik, an emerging-market strategist at Tellimer in Dubai.\n\nIts demise should be no surprise, he said.\n\nStill, policymakers dont plan to loosen their tight monetary stance or ditch the ZiG. Last week, the central bank kept the key rate at 35% and added that it would remain vigilant to any emerging risks to inflation and exchange rate stability.\n\nIts going to be a bumpy ride, but we are fully committed, Innocent Matshe, the RBZs deputy governor told business leaders on Feb. 13 in the capital, Harare.\n\nThe currencys survival depends on the ruling partys support, said Tony Hawkins, an independent economic consultant in Harare and former economics professor at the University of Zimbabwe.\n\nHistory has shown that every new currency in Zimbabwe has a shorter lifespan than its predecessor and with the ZiG not really being used it could be headed for the same fate, he said.\n\nWhat else is the ZiG used for except arbitrage opportunities and to pay civil servants, Hawkins, said.\n\nI cant see the ZiG surviving that long.\n\n",

            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nTHE Centre for Natural Resources Governance (CNRG) is demanding a thorough investigation into the death of another Zimbabwean at the Chinese-run Sino Africa Huijin Mine at Premier Estate in Old Mutare.\n\nAlfred Dzodzo was allegedly shot dead Wednesday night by a security guard who, without warning, fired directly into his face. Dzodzo was accused of attempting to steal gold.\n\nThe mine has operated illegally since 2023, its licence having expired. This unlawful operation has continued with the full knowledge of the government through the Environmental Management Agency (EMA), as confirmed to Parliament two years ago.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, CNRG called for a comprehensive investigation charging that the company has an apparent disregard for human life.\n\nWe also call for a thorough investigation into the killing of Alfred Dzodzo, with those responsible held accountable under the Zimbabwean law, reads part of the statement.\n\nAdditionally, an audit should be carried out on Sino Africa Huijins financial activities, particularly its alleged involvement in gold smuggling and organized crime, their statement reads.\n\nFollowing Dzodzos death, CNRG has urged the Zimbabwean government to shut down the mine, expel the Chinese operatorswho are understood to be working without a valid licenceand grant mining rights to local artisanal miners. They argue these miners deserve to benefit from the natural resources in their communities.\n\nIn light of this, CNRG calls on the government to permanently shut down Sino Africa Huijin and open the site to Zimbabwean artisanal miners under the auspices of Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation and Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe. This will ensure Zimbabwean nationals can benefit from their natural resources whilst also ensure government generate revenues, part of the statement reads.\n\nSino Africa Huijin is no stranger to controversy. In January this year, Taurai Dozva died mysteriously while on night duty at the mine. The Chinese offered his family US$2,000 as compensation  a plaster on a gaping wound.\n\nIn November 2023, CNRG implored Parliament to shut down the mine due to environmental crimes and exploitative labour practices. The company also reportedly smuggles unprocessed gold out of the country, robbing Zimbabwe of crucial revenue, a financial haemorrhage bleeding the nation dry.\n\nReports of killings and abusive labour practices by Chinese nationals at Zimbabwean mining sites are rampant, a grim tapestry woven with threads of exploitation.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Environmental Law Society (ZELA) and other labour rights activists have condemned these killings.\n\nA violent confrontation at Bijou Farm in Gweru on January 21 further illustrates the tension. A worker demanding unpaid wages clashed with supervisors, igniting outrage on social media and strengthening calls for action against exploitative Chinese investors.\n\nThe incident involved Kholwani Dube, an excavator operator employed by Ming Chang Sino-Africa Mining Investments.\n\nBeyond its appalling human rights and safety record, Sino Africa Huijin is accused of siphoning gold from Zimbabwe. Workers allege that much of the gold they mine goes undeclared, disappearing into the pockets of the Chinese owners.\n\nDzodzos killing has reignited the debate surrounding the treatment of Zimbabwean workers by Chinese investors, with critics accusing authorities of turning a blind eye to labour violations, leaving a bitter taste of injustice.\n\n",
