            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZANU PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa has been secretly recorded laying into Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, whom he argues is a cruel, unelectable and uneducated leader who has failed to grasp the difference between letters R and L.\n\nThe audio, part of United Kingdom-based investigative unit Dug Ups latest effort, opens a window into worsening factional fights between President Emmerson Mnangagwa and Chiwenga.\n\nA former army general and arguably the most loved man in Zimbabwe after toppling late President Robert Mugabe in November 2017, Chiwengas presidential aspirations have set him on a collision course with his former allies, who include Mutsvangwa and Mnangagwa.\n\nAccording to Mutsvangwa, Chiwenga and Mnangagwas tiff is centred on the next Zanu PF elective congress at which Chiwenga seemingly does not want to be challenged for the position of party first secretary and President.\n\nZanu PF national spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa\n\nHe wants to be endorsed, whereas Mnangagwa is maintaining that he should enter into a popularity contest against any other individual who might be interested in leading the party and standing as its candidate in 2028.\n\nThis guy wants to be anointed as the Presidents successor. He wants to remove him but while in the process of removing him he is saying the President should anoint him. How do you do that? Mutsvangwa can be heard speaking over the phone.\n\nMugabe used to nominate his deputies but this time number one is saying we must go for elections and that is normal for a democratic party.\n\nAn endorsement by Mnangagwa will all but quash any hopes of successfully contesting the seat against him.\n\nAll this is based on assumptions that Mnangagwa himself does not choose to extend his tenure beyond the 2028 constitutional limit as is being called for by various chapters within the party.\n\nOne of the stains on Chiwengas ambitious plans of leading the country, according to Mutsvangwa, is how he has handled his ex-wife Marry Mubaiwa.\n\nMubaiwa, who suffers from acute lymphoedema and has had some limbs cut off, stands accused of attempting to kill the former army commander.\n\nShe has been in and out of court for over three years, her passport held at the courts as she is being denied an opportunity to undergo life saving treatment outside the country.\n\nAdded Mutsvangwa: Can you imagine, half of the electorate are women in this country and you have decapitated the limbs of your former wife through cruelty and you are refusing her to see the children, including the ones she came to you with.\n\nWhen Number One tries to pardon her, you refuse. He reeks of cruelty against all women in the country, he cannot win so he does not want elections, but the president has upended him and told him to sell himself to the electorate.\n\nUnconfirmed reports have always referred to an unwritten pact between Mnangagwa and Chiwenga wherein the latter was promised State leadership after the former.\n\nThis plan, reportedly hampered in 2023, looks more likely to be fought again as 2028 approaches.\n\nMutsvangwa, a learned diplomat, clearly does not rate Chiwenga in the audio. Besides that he is relatively new to the party, his lack of academic wit, according to the former Presidential advisor, is a sign of ignorance.\n\nIf you want to know that a Shona speaking person did not go to school ask that they pronounce the letter L, Mutsvangwa goes on.\n\nThe letter R comes from the mother, the L comes from a teacher, that is the basic litmus test of an illiterate Shona person.\n\nHe never managed to graduate from the mothers alphabet. Going to war is no substitute for illiteracy and ignorance, we went to war from universities.\n\nThe full investigation, presented by journalist Maynard Manyowa is available on YouTube.\n\n",

These youngmen, commonly referred to as Mano (Elder Brother) have added onto the growing list of illegal vendors on Harares streets.\n\nThe general economy is playing against us; we have been playing hide-and-seek after vendors, and it is not working, said Chonzi.\n\nHeavy handedness is expected as has been evident in past operations such as Operation Murambatsvina in the early 2000s when slums, illegal structures and vending stalls were razed down by both government and council.\n\nBecause of this expectation, National Peace and Reconciliation Commission (NPRC) Commissioner Obert Gutu preached restraint, urging enforcers to realise that those on the streets were not there out of their own will but circumstances.\n\nBy late Friday evening, there was no evidence that municipal police and the ZRP had started their programme.\n\n",

The figure only covers the most essential medicines.\n\nThe availability of essential medicines increased from 22% in 2023 to around 50% in 2024. The increase in availability has largely been due to greater investment in medicines.\n\nFor instance, there are currently two main medicine supply contracts: Intrapharma (around US$24 million) and Clean Planet (around US$17 million).\n\nIn 2023, the government allocated about US$52 million for medicines. In 2025, the government committed approximately US$44 million toward medicines.\n\nThere are ongoing negotiations with the Treasury to increase the health budget in light of dwindling external support, Mombeshora said.\n\nZimbabwes health sector is generally underfunded and relies heavily on the benevolence of Western development partners.\n\n",

            "content": "A federal judge has ordered half a dozen federal agencies to immediately reinstate probationary employees fired last month as part of the Trump administrations effort to rapidly shrink the federal workforce, calling the effort a sham.\n\nThe preliminary injunction issued from the bench Thursday by US District Judge William Alsup requires the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury to rehire the employees. The judge said that he might extend the order to cover other federal agencies at a later time.\n\nAlsup, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, said he was making the ruling because he believes the Office of Personnel Management unlawfully directed the agencies earlier this year to lay off the probationary employees, who generally have been on the job for less than a year.\n\nThe judge said the order is effective immediately: This is the order and it counts.\n\nThe Justice Department indicated Thursday that it will appeal the ruling to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe ruling came in a case brought by labor unions and others challenging OPMs role in the firings, which affected thousands of employees and sent shockwaves through various federal agencies, some of which later rehired some of the workers.\n\nAlsup was highly critical of the administrations justification for firing the employees. OPM had provided agencies with a template termination letter that cited the employees performance as the reason they were being let go. But the judge said that rationale was the governments attempt to end-run federal law setting up specific rules for reducing the federal workforce.\n\nThe reason that OPM wanted to put this based on performance was at least in part in my judgment a gimmick to avoid the Reductions in Force Act, the judge said. Because the law always allows you to fire somebody for performance.\n\nIt is a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well thats a lie, he added. That should not have been done in our country. It was a sham in order to try to avoid statutory requirements.\n\nFederal probationary employees have typically been in their positions for one year, but some jobs have two-year probationary periods. The employees may be new to the federal workforce, but they also could have been recently promoted or shifted to a different agency.\n\nAlsups ruling is one of the most significant yet in cases testing the administrations authority to quickly reduce the number of federal employees  a key priority that has been central to the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe White House called the ruling absurd and unconstitutional.\n\nA single judge is attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the Executive Branch. The President has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch  singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the Presidents agenda, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statementposted on X by another White House aide.\n\nIf a federal district court judge would like executive powers, they can try and run for President themselves, Leavitt said.\n\nA second federal judgeruled later Thursday, in a similar case brought in Maryland by Democratic state attorneys general, that probationary employees laid off en masse by the Trump administration must be temporarily reinstated. That judges temporary restraining order, which will last two weeks, applies to 18 agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental Protection Agency and the US Agency for International Development.\n\nThe preliminary injunction came after Alsup unloaded on the Justice Department for not making the acting head of the Office of Personnel Management available to testify about the Trump administrations decision to fire scores of probationary employees.\n\nHe had ordered acting OPM Director Charles Ezell to testify during Thursdays hearing, where he would likely face tough questions from attorneys representing the labor unions that are challenging his agencys role in the firings.\n\nBut the Justice Department refused to make him available and instead withdrew a declaration Ezell submitted last month that had served as the governments only evidence in the case.\n\nYoure afraid to do so because you know cross-examination will reveal the truth, Alsup told DOJ attorney Kelsey Helland. I tend to doubt that youre telling me the truth.\n\nAlsup told the DOJ attorney Thursday: You cant just say, heres a declaration, you have to accept it without question when there is a question.\n\nYoure not helping me get at the truth. Youre giving me press releases  sham documents, the judge said, referring to documents submitted by the DOJ to the court that they say shows how the agencies were making the termination decisions themselves.\n\nThe declaration from Ezell said that OPM did not direct other agencies to terminate probationary employees  the central issue in the case brought by labor unions and others.\n\nHelland pushed back strongly on the judges assertion, and argued during the hearing that the agency heads had sought to cull their workforce on their own, not at the direction of OPM.\n\nI respectfully disagree that we have submitted false evidence, he said at one point, adding later: Decisions on these employment actions were made by these agencies and were fully endorsed by their political leadership.\n\nThe Trump administration has been targeting probationary workers because they have fewer job protections and can be dismissed more easily. While they generally cannot appeal their termination to the Merit Systems Protection Board, they can if the action stemmed from partisan political reasons or marriage status. Also, they are protected from prohibited personnel practices.\n\nPart of Thursdays hearing concerned whether the employees at issue in the case have the option of appealing their firing to the MSPB, something Alsup had initially understood was possible. But the judge said he wanted the parties to submit more written legal arguments on the issue before he decides how to factor it into his ruling.\n\nOne former probationary employee who wasfired last monthfrom the IRS, an agency within the Treasury Department, told CNN that he and his colleagues were thrilled with the ruling.\n\nEveryone on the group chat is celebrating, the former IRS employee said, referring to a text chat where his former colleagues have been consoling each other in recent weeks.\n\n",
