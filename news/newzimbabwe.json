This prompted her to alert the Ministry of Health, and a report was made to the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC), the State alleges further.This then led to Chigumiras arrest and the US$530 has not been recovered.\n\nThe complainant is Miriam Mverechana who allegedly lost US$530 to Chigumira.\n\nChigumira was not asked to plead and was remanded out of custody to January 19, 2025, on US$300 bail.According to court papers, sometime in June 2024, the Ministry of Health flighted an advert inviting interested applicants to submit applications for a two-year certificate in primary nursing training course.It is alleged that Chigumira connived with Evelyn Shonhiwa, who is still at large, to defraud unsuspecting individuals interested in the nurse training programme.They allegedly misrepresented that they were responsible for recruiting youths through the Zanu PF Medical Directorate, which Chigumira heads.The accused person purported that he had links with the Minister of Health and would use his proximity to facilitate securing a place for the complainants son (Dylan Kundai Huchu) to train as a primary care nurse, the State alleges.The two allegedly called Mverechena notifying her that she was supposed to pay US$800 as facilitation fee to enhance the opportunity and access to the scarce recruitment of her son.On August 2, 2024, at about 1500 hours the complainant and her son proceeded to Zanu PF headquarters with US$500 which the complainant had managed to raise instead of the proposed US$800.They met accused two (Shonhiwa) who is still at large outside the Zanu PF Headquarters gate who accompanied the complainant and her son to accuseds one (Chigumira)s motor vehicle which was parked inside Zanu PF Headquarters yard.The accused person then drove the complainant and her son together with Shonhiwa to his Afgate Surgery at corner Simon Muzenda and George Silundika Street, where the complainant gave Shonhiwa the US$500 who after counting the money queried why it was not amounting to US$800 before handing it over to the accused one, the State alleges further.The court heard that the accused persons then took the complainant and her son on a tour of Afgate Surgery assuring them that all was well because Chigumira was responsible for recruiting Zanu PF youths on behalf of the Ministry of Health hence her son was guaranteed to get recruited for the post he applied for.The court heard that Shonhiwa further demanded for more money citing that there were several stakeholders involved in the deal prompting the complainant to pay her US$30 through EcoCash before they departed Afgate Surgery.The complainants son did not get recruited for the primary nurse training course as promised in this case.

Such actions cannot go unchallenged.We know such people as Sibongile Kadzima, Jenatry Muranganwa alias Chihota, Basil Kamombe, Greatman Makipa, Sandra Chidemo, Shepherd Yuda, Silvanos Mudzvova, Petty Ziramba, Nobukhosi Dube, Evelyn Chigaro, Jane Mundangepfupfu, Xoliso Sithole and Sakhile Ncube.Others include, Dickson Chikwizo, Vengai Mutsawu, Brian Chikukwa, Melody Magejo, Biggie Nyateka, Munyaradzi Zengeni, Mashama Petronella Mazise, Diana Machingauta, Darlington Mlambo, Pamela Magwizi Josephine Jenje and many more, said the source.Our team in the UK has identified these through various strategies and we can confirm that these individuals have cases to answer.Government officials, who preferred to remain anonymous, maintain that the investigation will adhere to due process and target only those who violated Zimbabwean laws.The revelation has reportedly drawn criticism from human rights activists, who fear the governments actions may lead to political persecution.We will arrest them under Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act [Chapter 9:23]  said the source privy to the operation.Some deportees, who were merely exercising their right to free speech in democratic settings such as the UK, will soon find themselves in soup facing justice back home.This sting operation has been previously executed, but this time around finds impetus courtesy of the recently promulgated Patriotic Act.\n\nSources told NewZimbabwe.com that there was a recent deployment of a special investigative team to UK tasked with scrutinizing the activities of certain individuals linked to opposition politics, particularly those accused of undermining the sovereignty of the country and advocating for crippling sanctions.\n\nMinistry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage sources have highlighted that this move is part of broader efforts to uphold the countrys laws and protect its democratic institutions.We are aware that some individuals deported from the UK have been politically active abroad, engaging in activities that are detrimental to Zimbabwes sovereignty.This includes spearheading campaigns inviting imposition of sanctions and disseminating false information to undermine the democratically elected government.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) says parents and guardians must not lower the guard and let minors consume alcohol and other intoxicating substances during the festive season.\n\nIn recent years, social media has been awash with images and videos of visibly drunk underage children who would have taken alcohol, sometimes right under the noses of their elders.\n\nIn a statement ahead of the Unity Day, Christmas and New Year holidays, outgoing Police Commissioner-General, Godwin Tandabantu Matanga warned of the risk of letting children consume alcohol.\n\nmay I take this opportunity to strongly warn parents and guardians who allow minors under the guise of merry-making to partake in beer drinking orgies, Matanga said.\n\nHe also warned those operating unlicensed liquor outlets or shebeens to desist from the illegal practices.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police has taken note of reports of liquor outlets in some Central Business Districts and residential areas which are not observing the provisions of the Liquor Act, Chapter 14:12 by operating outside their stipulated opening and closing times.\n\nSome illegal joints are accused of dispensing beer and other intoxicating substances to children, thereby exposing them to harm.\n\nSome are even allowing minors to access alcohol through their facilities. May I buttress that arrests will be effected, and the law will certainly take its course.\n\nMeanwhile, ZRP says it will be out in full force during this festive season to arrest those who intend to smuggle goods in and out of the country during the festive season.\n\nIt will deploy 24 hours roadblocks during this peak season in order to curb smuggling of gadgets, second hand clothes, cars and food items.\n\nMatanga said all importers and exporters should lead by example, failure of which the law will take its course if found sneaking in contraband.\n\nPolice officers will also take action against anyone found engaging in the smuggling of goods into and out of the country.\n\nMay I take this opportunity to encourage all individuals and institutions involved in the importation and exportation activities to lead by example and officially declare all goods at the countrys ports of entry and exit.\n\nThe law will take its course without fear or favour on transporters who are involved in smuggling activities and those using undesignated points along our border lines to commit crime, said Matanga.\n\nIn this regard, the Zimbabwe Republic Police has made adequate deployments to ensure that peace prevails throughout the period.\n\nThe deployments will include, heightened roadblocks, traffic blitz, stop and search,the motorized and cycle patrols to curb crime, road traffic accidents, maintain law and order Central Business Districts, residential, industrial as well leisure facilities to be frequented by the public while celebrating the countrys Unity Day, Christmas Day and New Years eve (2025).\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police urges all stakeholders who include transporters, to prioritize the safety and security of the public on the roads and all gatherings, said the commissioner-general.\n\nHe said ZRP deployed police officers on a blitz on all roads inorder to weed out unroadworthy cars which will be impounded, and all pirate taxis barred from passing checkpoints.\n\nAs road safety campaigns are being conducted, the Zimbabwe Republic Police shall impound all defective and unroadworthy vehicles.\n\nIn the same measure, the commuting public are discouraged from boarding non-public service vehicles for their own safety and other travellers. May I caution drivers to avoid overloading of vehicles and speeding on the roads.\n\nMay I, therefore, reiterate that road safety campaigns will include the components of education to prevent accidents, promote compliance with road rules and regulations and strict enforcement of the countrys laws to ensure that no pirate taxis or mushika-shika vehicles are allowed to pass through police check points, said Matanga.\n\nHe further cautioned Public Service Vehicle operators, both local and cross border to minimise night travelling as most fatal road traffic accidents are being recorded at night due to vision and observation challenges.\n\nMotorists and citizens should also avoid crossing flooded rivers and bridges and take note of the rainy season as the roads will be slippery.\n\nThe police chief said his office will also take action on reports of corruption on the countrys roads.\n\nHe also warned the public to be alert and safety conscious to curb cases of robbery, murder and other crimes.\n\nAs the public embarks on various activities during this festive period, families, businesspersons and institutions should avoid carrying or keeping large sums of money at home or offices to curb robbery and other related violent criminal acts, said Matanga\n\nThe police boss also warned that individuals who want to discharge fireworks and other gadgets that will likely disturb the safety and security of the general populace to first notify the police.\n\n",

With 80% unemployment and the scars of past elections still fresh, our nation must shift its focus from mere electoral politics to meaningful development.\n\nAs we look upon the challenges of the El Nino-induced drought and economic hardship, we are reminded of the biblical call to stewardship and service.\n\nIn Proverbs 29:18, we read, Where there is no vision, the people perish. This verse underscores the importance of having a clear vision for our nation, one that is not fixated on the next election but rather on sustainable development and prosperity. Our leaders must recognize that their primary responsibility is to serve the electorate through job creation and infrastructure development.\n\nThe current efforts being made by the government in roads and bridges construction as well as the current, parts of Harare roads facelift are commendable, yet these must be part of a larger strategy focused on empowering the underprivileged and ensuring food security, especially in rural areas.\n\nIn Micah 6:8, we are reminded of what the Lord requires of us: To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God. Elected officials must embody these principles, leading with integrity and compassion rather than resorting to falsehoods, violence, intimidation and the use of machetes.\n\nThose who threaten the peace of our communities compromise the presidents 2030 vision for a prosperous Zimbabwe and jeopardize our collective future.\n\nAs we face the looming challenges of climate change and social inequity, our leaders must prioritize service provision over political posturing.\n\nThe recent increase in the community development fund by the minister of finance, from fifty thousand dollars to one hundred thousand dollars, is a step in the right direction. Leaders should focus on tangible results that uplift citizens rather than remaining in an election mode filled with empty promises and rhetoric.\n\nA Prayer for Zimbabwe\n\nHeavenly Father,We come before You with heavy hearts for our beloved Zimbabwe. We ask for Your guidance upon our leaders, that they may turn their focus from the next election to the urgent needs of our people. Grant them wisdom to prioritize development and job creation, to nurture peace and unity, and to serve with integrity.\n\nLord, we pray for those who are suffering from hunger and hardship. May Your provision flow abundantly to the vulnerable and underprivileged. Empower our leaders to be instruments of Your will, fostering a spirit of cooperation and compassion.\n\nAs we strive toward a brighter future, may our nation reflect Your love and grace. Help us to walk humbly and act justly, as we work together to revive Zimbabwe as the breadbasket of Africa. In Jesus name, we pray.\n\nAmen.\n\n",

            "content": "By BBC\n\nHIDEKO Hakamata, 91, fought half her life to free her brother  the worlds longest serving death row inmate.\n\nWhen a court declared Iwao Hakamata innocent in September, the worlds longest-serving death row inmate seemed unable to comprehend, much less savour the moment.I told him he was acquitted, and he was silent, Hideko Hakamata, his 91-year-old sister, tells the BBC at her home in Hamamatsu, Japan.I couldnt tell whetherheunderstood or not.Hidekohad been fighting for her brothers retrial ever since he was convicted of quadruple murder in 1968.In September 2024, at the age of 88, he was finally acquitted  ending Japans longest running legal saga.Mr Hakamatas case is remarkable. But it also shines a light on the systemic brutality underpinning Japans justice system, where death row inmates are only notified of their hanging a few hours in advance, and spend years unsure whether each day will be their last.Human rights experts have long condemned such treatment as cruel and inhuman, saying it exacerbates prisoners risk of developing a serious mental illness.And more than half a lifetime spent in solitary confinement, waiting to be executed for a crime he didnt commit, took a heavy toll on Mr Hakamata.Iwao Hakamata has been living with his sister, Hideko, since being granted a rare retrial in 2014. Since being granted a retrial and released from prison in 2014, he has lived under Hidekos close care.When we arrive at the apartment he is on his daily outing with a volunteer group that supports the two elderly siblings. He is anxious around strangers, Hideko explains, and has been in his own world for years.Maybe it cant be helped, she says. This is what happens when you are locked up and crammed in a small prison cell for more than 40 years.They made him live like an animal.Life on death rowA former professional boxer,Iwao Hakamata was working at a miso processing plant when the bodies of his boss, the mans wife and their two teenage children were found. All four had been stabbed to death.Authorities accused Mr Hakamata of murdering the family, setting their house in Shizuoka alight and stealing 200,000 yen (199; $556) in cash.We had no idea what was going on, Hideko says of the day in 1966 when police came to arrest her brother.The family home was searched, as well as the homes of their two elder sisters, and Mr Hakamata was taken away.He initially denied all charges, but later gave what he came to describe as a coerced confession following beatings and interrogations that lasted up to 12 hours a day.Two years after his arrest, MrHakamata was convicted of murder and arson and sentenced to death. It was when he was moved to a cell on death row that Hideko noticed a shift in his demeanour.One prison visit in particular stands out.He told me, there was an execution yesterday  it was a person in the next cell, she recalls.He told me to take care  and from then on, he completely changed mentally and became very quiet.Mr Hakamata is not the only one to be damaged by life on Japans death row, where inmates wake each morning not knowing if it will be their last.Between 08:00 and 08:30 in the morning was the most critical time, because that was generally when prisoners were notified of their execution, Menda Sakae, who spent 34 years on death row before being exonerated, wrote in a book about his experience.You begin to feel the most terrible anxiety, because you dont know if they are going to stop in front of your cell. It is impossible to express how awful a feeling this was.James Welsh, lead author of a 2009 Amnesty International report into conditions on death row, noted that the daily threat of imminent death is cruel, inhuman and degrading.The report concluded that inmates were at risk of significant mental health issues.Hideko could only watch as her own brothers mental health deteriorated as the years went by.Once he asked me Do you know who I am? I said, Yes, I do. You are Iwao Hakamata. No, he said, you must be here to see a different person. And he just went back [to his cell].Hideko stepped up as his primary spokesperson and advocate. It wasnt until 2014, however, that there was a breakthrough in his case.Hideko, 91, says she always felt the need to protect her little brotherA key piece of evidence against Mr Hakamata were red-stained clothes found in a miso tank at his workplace.They were recovered a year and two months after the murders and the prosecution said they belonged to him. But for years Mr Hakamatas defence team argued that the DNA recovered from the clothes did not match his  and alleged that the evidence was planted.In 2014 they were able to persuade a judge to release him from prison and grant him a retrial.Prolonged legal proceedings meant it took until last October for the retrial to begin. When it finally did, it was Hidekowho appeared in court, pleading for her brothers life.Mr Hakamatas fate hinged on the stains, and specifically how they had aged.The prosecution had claimed the stains were reddish when the clothes were recovered  but the defence argued that blood would have turned blackish after being immersed in miso for so long.That was enough to convince presiding judgeKoshi Kunii, who declared that the investigating authority had added blood stains and hid the items in the miso tank well after the incident took place.Judge Kunii further found that other evidence had been fabricated, including an investigation record, and declared Mr Hakamata innocent.Hidekos first reaction was to cry.When the judge said that the defendant is not guilty, I was elated; I was in tears, she says.I am not a tearful person, but mytearsjust flowed without stopping for about an hour.Hostage justiceThe courts conclusion that evidence against Mr Hakamata was fabricated raises troubling questions.Japan has a 99% conviction rate, and a system of so-called hostage justice which, according to Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch, denies people arrested their rights to a presumption of innocence, a prompt and fair bail hearing, and access to counsel during questioning.These abusive practices have resulted in lives and families being torn apart, as well as wrongful convictions, Ms Doi noted in 2023.David T Johnson, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose research focuses on criminal justice in Japan, has followed the Hakamata case for the last 30 years.He said one reason it dragged on is that critical evidence for the defence was not disclosed to them until around 2010.The failure was egregious and inexcusable, Mr Johnson told the BBC. Judges kept kicking the case down the road, as they frequently do in response to retrial petitions (because) they are busy, and the law allows them to do so.Hideko campaigned for years for her brothers retrialHidekosays the core of the injustice was the forced confession and the coercion her brother suffered.But Mr Johnson says false accusations dont happen because of a single mistake. Instead, they are compounded by failings at all levels  from the police right through to the prosecutors, courts and parliament.Judges have the last word, he added. When a wrongful conviction occurs, it is, in the end, because they said so. All too often, the responsibility of judges for producing and maintaining wrongful convictions gets neglected, elided, and ignored.Against that backdrop, Mr Hakamatas acquittal was a watershed  a rare moment of retrospective justice.After declaring Mr Hakamata innocent, the judge presiding over his retrial apologised toHidekofor how long it took to achieve justice.A short while later, Takayoshi Tsuda, chief of Shizuoka police, visitedherhome and bowed in front of both brother and sister.For the past 58 years we caused you indescribable anxiety and burden, Mr Tsuda said. We are truly sorry.Hideko gave an unexpected reply to the police chief.We believe that everything that happened was our destiny, she said.We will not complain about anything now.The pink doorAfter nearly 60 years of anxiety and heartache, Hideko has styled her home with the express intention of letting some light in. The rooms are bright and inviting, filled with pictures of her and Iwaoalongside family friends and supporters.Hideko laughs as she shares memories of her cute little brother as a baby, leafing through black-and-white family photos.The youngest of six siblings, he seems to always be standing next to her.We were always together when we were children, she explains.I always knew I had to take care of my little brother.And so, it continues.She walks into Mr Hakamatas room and introduces their ginger cat, which occupies the chair he normally sits in. Then she points to pictures of him as a young professional boxer.He wanted to become a champion, she says. Then the incident happened.After Mr Hakamata was released in 2014, Hideko wanted to make the apartment as bright as possible, she explains. So she painted the front door pink.I believed that if he was in a bright room and had a cheerful life, he would naturally get well.Its the first thing one notices when visiting Hidekos apartment, this bright pink statement of hope and resilience.Its unclear whether it has worked  Mr Hakamata still paces back and forth for hours, just as he did for years in a jail cell the size of three single tatami mats.But Hideko refuses to linger on the question of what their lives might have looked like if not for such an egregious miscarriage of justice.When asked who she blames for her brothers suffering, she replies: no-one.Complaining about what happened will get us nowhere.Her priority now is to keep her brother comfortable. She shaves his face, massages his head, slices apples and apricots for his breakfast each morning.Hideko, who has spent the majority of her 91 years fighting for her brothers freedom, says this was their fate.I dont want to think about the past. I dont know how long Im going to live, she says.I just want Iwao to live a peaceful and quiet life.\n\nWhen a court declared Iwao Hakamata innocent in September, the worlds longest-serving death row inmate seemed unable to comprehend, much less savour the moment.\n\nI told him he was acquitted, and he was silent, Hideko Hakamata, his 91-year-old sister, tells the BBC at her home in Hamamatsu, Japan.I couldnt tell whetherheunderstood or not.Hidekohad been fighting for her brothers retrial ever since he was convicted of quadruple murder in 1968.In September 2024, at the age of 88, he was finally acquitted  ending Japans longest running legal saga.Mr Hakamatas case is remarkable.

All four had been stabbed to death.Authorities accused Mr Hakamata of murdering the family, setting their house in Shizuoka alight and stealing 200,000 yen (199; $556) in cash.We had no idea what was going on, Hideko says of the day in 1966 when police came to arrest her brother.The family home was searched, as well as the homes of their two elder sisters, and Mr Hakamata was taken away.He initially denied all charges, but later gave what he came to describe as a coerced confession following beatings and interrogations that lasted up to 12 hours a day.Two years after his arrest, MrHakamata was convicted of murder and arson and sentenced to death. It was when he was moved to a cell on death row that Hideko noticed a shift in his demeanour.One prison visit in particular stands out.He told me, there was an execution yesterday  it was a person in the next cell, she recalls.He told me to take care  and from then on, he completely changed mentally and became very quiet.Mr Hakamata is not the only one to be damaged by life on Japans death row, where inmates wake each morning not knowing if it will be their last.Between 08:00 and 08:30 in the morning was the most critical time, because that was generally when prisoners were notified of their execution, Menda Sakae, who spent 34 years on death row before being exonerated, wrote in a book about his experience.You begin to feel the most terrible anxiety, because you dont know if they are going to stop in front of your cell. It is impossible to express how awful a feeling this was.James Welsh, lead author of a 2009 Amnesty International report into conditions on death row, noted that the daily threat of imminent death is cruel, inhuman and degrading.The report concluded that inmates were at risk of significant mental health issues.Hideko could only watch as her own brothers mental health deteriorated as the years went by.Once he asked me Do you know who I am? I said, Yes, I do. You are Iwao Hakamata. No, he said, you must be here to see a different person. And he just went back [to his cell].Hideko stepped up as his primary spokesperson and advocate. It wasnt until 2014, however, that there was a breakthrough in his case.Hideko, 91, says she always felt the need to protect her little brotherA key piece of evidence against Mr Hakamata were red-stained clothes found in a miso tank at his workplace.They were recovered a year and two months after the murders and the prosecution said they belonged to him. But for years Mr Hakamatas defence team argued that the DNA recovered from the clothes did not match his  and alleged that the evidence was planted.In 2014 they were able to persuade a judge to release him from prison and grant him a retrial.Prolonged legal proceedings meant it took until last October for the retrial to begin. When it finally did, it was Hidekowho appeared in court, pleading for her brothers life.Mr Hakamatas fate hinged on the stains, and specifically how they had aged.The prosecution had claimed the stains were reddish when the clothes were recovered  but the defence argued that blood would have turned blackish after being immersed in miso for so long.That was enough to convince presiding judgeKoshi Kunii, who declared that the investigating authority had added blood stains and hid the items in the miso tank well after the incident took place.Judge Kunii further found that other evidence had been fabricated, including an investigation record, and declared Mr Hakamata innocent.Hidekos first reaction was to cry.When the judge said that the defendant is not guilty, I was elated; I was in tears, she says.I am not a tearful person, but mytearsjust flowed without stopping for about an hour.Hostage justiceThe courts conclusion that evidence against Mr Hakamata was fabricated raises troubling questions.Japan has a 99% conviction rate, and a system of so-called hostage justice which, according to Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch, denies people arrested their rights to a presumption of innocence, a prompt and fair bail hearing, and access to counsel during questioning.These abusive practices have resulted in lives and families being torn apart, as well as wrongful convictions, Ms Doi noted in 2023.David T Johnson, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose research focuses on criminal justice in Japan, has followed the Hakamata case for the last 30 years.He said one reason it dragged on is that critical evidence for the defence was not disclosed to them until around 2010.The failure was egregious and inexcusable, Mr Johnson told the BBC. Judges kept kicking the case down the road, as they frequently do in response to retrial petitions (because) they are busy, and the law allows them to do so.Hideko campaigned for years for her brothers retrialHidekosays the core of the injustice was the forced confession and the coercion her brother suffered.But Mr Johnson says false accusations dont happen because of a single mistake. Instead, they are compounded by failings at all levels  from the police right through to the prosecutors, courts and parliament.Judges have the last word, he added. When a wrongful conviction occurs, it is, in the end, because they said so. All too often, the responsibility of judges for producing and maintaining wrongful convictions gets neglected, elided, and ignored.Against that backdrop, Mr Hakamatas acquittal was a watershed  a rare moment of retrospective justice.After declaring Mr Hakamata innocent, the judge presiding over his retrial apologised toHidekofor how long it took to achieve justice.A short while later, Takayoshi Tsuda, chief of Shizuoka police, visitedherhome and bowed in front of both brother and sister.For the past 58 years we caused you indescribable anxiety and burden, Mr Tsuda said. We are truly sorry.Hideko gave an unexpected reply to the police chief.We believe that everything that happened was our destiny, she said.We will not complain about anything now.The pink doorAfter nearly 60 years of anxiety and heartache, Hideko has styled her home with the express intention of letting some light in. The rooms are bright and inviting, filled with pictures of her and Iwaoalongside family friends and supporters.Hideko laughs as she shares memories of her cute little brother as a baby, leafing through black-and-white family photos.The youngest of six siblings, he seems to always be standing next to her.We were always together when we were children, she explains.I always knew I had to take care of my little brother.And so, it continues.She walks into Mr Hakamatas room and introduces their ginger cat, which occupies the chair he normally sits in. Then she points to pictures of him as a young professional boxer.He wanted to become a champion, she says. Then the incident happened.After Mr Hakamata was released in 2014, Hideko wanted to make the apartment as bright as possible, she explains. So she painted the front door pink.I believed that if he was in a bright room and had a cheerful life, he would naturally get well.Its the first thing one notices when visiting Hidekos apartment, this bright pink statement of hope and resilience.Its unclear whether it has worked  Mr Hakamata still paces back and forth for hours, just as he did for years in a jail cell the size of three single tatami mats.But Hideko refuses to linger on the question of what their lives might have looked like if not for such an egregious miscarriage of justice.When asked who she blames for her brothers suffering, she replies: no-one.Complaining about what happened will get us nowhere.Her priority now is to keep her brother comfortable. She shaves his face, massages his head, slices apples and apricots for his breakfast each morning.Hideko, who has spent the majority of her 91 years fighting for her brothers freedom, says this was their fate.I dont want to think about the past. I dont know how long Im going to live, she says.I just want Iwao to live a peaceful and quiet life.\n\nHidekohad been fighting for her brothers retrial ever since he was convicted of quadruple murder in 1968.\n\nIn September 2024, at the age of 88, he was finally acquitted  ending Japans longest running legal saga.Mr Hakamatas case is remarkable. But it also shines a light on the systemic brutality underpinning Japans justice system, where death row inmates are only notified of their hanging a few hours in advance, and spend years unsure whether each day will be their last.Human rights experts have long condemned such treatment as cruel and inhuman, saying it exacerbates prisoners risk of developing a serious mental illness.And more than half a lifetime spent in solitary confinement, waiting to be executed for a crime he didnt commit, took a heavy toll on Mr Hakamata.Iwao Hakamata has been living with his sister, Hideko, since being granted a rare retrial in 2014.

She shaves his face, massages his head, slices apples and apricots for his breakfast each morning.Hideko, who has spent the majority of her 91 years fighting for her brothers freedom, says this was their fate.I dont want to think about the past. I dont know how long Im going to live, she says.I just want Iwao to live a peaceful and quiet life.\n\nHuman rights experts have long condemned such treatment as cruel and inhuman, saying it exacerbates prisoners risk of developing a serious mental illness.\n\nAnd more than half a lifetime spent in solitary confinement, waiting to be executed for a crime he didnt commit, took a heavy toll on Mr Hakamata.Iwao Hakamata has been living with his sister, Hideko, since being granted a rare retrial in 2014. Since being granted a retrial and released from prison in 2014, he has lived under Hidekos close care.When we arrive at the apartment he is on his daily outing with a volunteer group that supports the two elderly siblings. He is anxious around strangers, Hideko explains, and has been in his own world for years.Maybe it cant be helped, she says. This is what happens when you are locked up and crammed in a small prison cell for more than 40 years.They made him live like an animal.Life on death rowA former professional boxer,Iwao Hakamata was working at a miso processing plant when the bodies of his boss, the mans wife and their two teenage children were found. All four had been stabbed to death.Authorities accused Mr Hakamata of murdering the family, setting their house in Shizuoka alight and stealing 200,000 yen (199; $556) in cash.We had no idea what was going on, Hideko says of the day in 1966 when police came to arrest her brother.The family home was searched, as well as the homes of their two elder sisters, and Mr Hakamata was taken away.He initially denied all charges, but later gave what he came to describe as a coerced confession following beatings and interrogations that lasted up to 12 hours a day.Two years after his arrest, MrHakamata was convicted of murder and arson and sentenced to death. It was when he was moved to a cell on death row that Hideko noticed a shift in his demeanour.One prison visit in particular stands out.He told me, there was an execution yesterday  it was a person in the next cell, she recalls.He told me to take care  and from then on, he completely changed mentally and became very quiet.Mr Hakamata is not the only one to be damaged by life on Japans death row, where inmates wake each morning not knowing if it will be their last.Between 08:00 and 08:30 in the morning was the most critical time, because that was generally when prisoners were notified of their execution, Menda Sakae, who spent 34 years on death row before being exonerated, wrote in a book about his experience.You begin to feel the most terrible anxiety, because you dont know if they are going to stop in front of your cell. It is impossible to express how awful a feeling this was.James Welsh, lead author of a 2009 Amnesty International report into conditions on death row, noted that the daily threat of imminent death is cruel, inhuman and degrading.The report concluded that inmates were at risk of significant mental health issues.Hideko could only watch as her own brothers mental health deteriorated as the years went by.Once he asked me Do you know who I am? I said, Yes, I do. You are Iwao Hakamata. No, he said, you must be here to see a different person. And he just went back [to his cell].Hideko stepped up as his primary spokesperson and advocate. It wasnt until 2014, however, that there was a breakthrough in his case.Hideko, 91, says she always felt the need to protect her little brotherA key piece of evidence against Mr Hakamata were red-stained clothes found in a miso tank at his workplace.They were recovered a year and two months after the murders and the prosecution said they belonged to him. But for years Mr Hakamatas defence team argued that the DNA recovered from the clothes did not match his  and alleged that the evidence was planted.In 2014 they were able to persuade a judge to release him from prison and grant him a retrial.Prolonged legal proceedings meant it took until last October for the retrial to begin. When it finally did, it was Hidekowho appeared in court, pleading for her brothers life.Mr Hakamatas fate hinged on the stains, and specifically how they had aged.The prosecution had claimed the stains were reddish when the clothes were recovered  but the defence argued that blood would have turned blackish after being immersed in miso for so long.That was enough to convince presiding judgeKoshi Kunii, who declared that the investigating authority had added blood stains and hid the items in the miso tank well after the incident took place.Judge Kunii further found that other evidence had been fabricated, including an investigation record, and declared Mr Hakamata innocent.Hidekos first reaction was to cry.When the judge said that the defendant is not guilty, I was elated; I was in tears, she says.I am not a tearful person, but mytearsjust flowed without stopping for about an hour.Hostage justiceThe courts conclusion that evidence against Mr Hakamata was fabricated raises troubling questions.Japan has a 99% conviction rate, and a system of so-called hostage justice which, according to Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch, denies people arrested their rights to a presumption of innocence, a prompt and fair bail hearing, and access to counsel during questioning.These abusive practices have resulted in lives and families being torn apart, as well as wrongful convictions, Ms Doi noted in 2023.David T Johnson, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose research focuses on criminal justice in Japan, has followed the Hakamata case for the last 30 years.He said one reason it dragged on is that critical evidence for the defence was not disclosed to them until around 2010.The failure was egregious and inexcusable, Mr Johnson told the BBC. Judges kept kicking the case down the road, as they frequently do in response to retrial petitions (because) they are busy, and the law allows them to do so.Hideko campaigned for years for her brothers retrialHidekosays the core of the injustice was the forced confession and the coercion her brother suffered.But Mr Johnson says false accusations dont happen because of a single mistake. Instead, they are compounded by failings at all levels  from the police right through to the prosecutors, courts and parliament.Judges have the last word, he added. When a wrongful conviction occurs, it is, in the end, because they said so. All too often, the responsibility of judges for producing and maintaining wrongful convictions gets neglected, elided, and ignored.Against that backdrop, Mr Hakamatas acquittal was a watershed  a rare moment of retrospective justice.After declaring Mr Hakamata innocent, the judge presiding over his retrial apologised toHidekofor how long it took to achieve justice.A short while later, Takayoshi Tsuda, chief of Shizuoka police, visitedherhome and bowed in front of both brother and sister.For the past 58 years we caused you indescribable anxiety and burden, Mr Tsuda said. We are truly sorry.Hideko gave an unexpected reply to the police chief.We believe that everything that happened was our destiny, she said.We will not complain about anything now.The pink doorAfter nearly 60 years of anxiety and heartache, Hideko has styled her home with the express intention of letting some light in. The rooms are bright and inviting, filled with pictures of her and Iwaoalongside family friends and supporters.Hideko laughs as she shares memories of her cute little brother as a baby, leafing through black-and-white family photos.The youngest of six siblings, he seems to always be standing next to her.We were always together when we were children, she explains.I always knew I had to take care of my little brother.And so, it continues.She walks into Mr Hakamatas room and introduces their ginger cat, which occupies the chair he normally sits in. Then she points to pictures of him as a young professional boxer.He wanted to become a champion, she says.

I dont know how long Im going to live, she says.I just want Iwao to live a peaceful and quiet life.\n\nMaybe it cant be helped, she says. This is what happens when you are locked up and crammed in a small prison cell for more than 40 years.\n\nThey made him live like an animal.Life on death rowA former professional boxer,Iwao Hakamata was working at a miso processing plant when the bodies of his boss, the mans wife and their two teenage children were found. All four had been stabbed to death.Authorities accused Mr Hakamata of murdering the family, setting their house in Shizuoka alight and stealing 200,000 yen (199; $556) in cash.We had no idea what was going on, Hideko says of the day in 1966 when police came to arrest her brother.The family home was searched, as well as the homes of their two elder sisters, and Mr Hakamata was taken away.He initially denied all charges, but later gave what he came to describe as a coerced confession following beatings and interrogations that lasted up to 12 hours a day.Two years after his arrest, MrHakamata was convicted of murder and arson and sentenced to death. It was when he was moved to a cell on death row that Hideko noticed a shift in his demeanour.One prison visit in particular stands out.He told me, there was an execution yesterday  it was a person in the next cell, she recalls.He told me to take care  and from then on, he completely changed mentally and became very quiet.Mr Hakamata is not the only one to be damaged by life on Japans death row, where inmates wake each morning not knowing if it will be their last.Between 08:00 and 08:30 in the morning was the most critical time, because that was generally when prisoners were notified of their execution, Menda Sakae, who spent 34 years on death row before being exonerated, wrote in a book about his experience.You begin to feel the most terrible anxiety, because you dont know if they are going to stop in front of your cell. It is impossible to express how awful a feeling this was.James Welsh, lead author of a 2009 Amnesty International report into conditions on death row, noted that the daily threat of imminent death is cruel, inhuman and degrading.The report concluded that inmates were at risk of significant mental health issues.Hideko could only watch as her own brothers mental health deteriorated as the years went by.Once he asked me Do you know who I am? I said, Yes, I do. You are Iwao Hakamata. No, he said, you must be here to see a different person. And he just went back [to his cell].Hideko stepped up as his primary spokesperson and advocate. It wasnt until 2014, however, that there was a breakthrough in his case.Hideko, 91, says she always felt the need to protect her little brotherA key piece of evidence against Mr Hakamata were red-stained clothes found in a miso tank at his workplace.They were recovered a year and two months after the murders and the prosecution said they belonged to him. But for years Mr Hakamatas defence team argued that the DNA recovered from the clothes did not match his  and alleged that the evidence was planted.In 2014 they were able to persuade a judge to release him from prison and grant him a retrial.Prolonged legal proceedings meant it took until last October for the retrial to begin. When it finally did, it was Hidekowho appeared in court, pleading for her brothers life.Mr Hakamatas fate hinged on the stains, and specifically how they had aged.The prosecution had claimed the stains were reddish when the clothes were recovered  but the defence argued that blood would have turned blackish after being immersed in miso for so long.That was enough to convince presiding judgeKoshi Kunii, who declared that the investigating authority had added blood stains and hid the items in the miso tank well after the incident took place.Judge Kunii further found that other evidence had been fabricated, including an investigation record, and declared Mr Hakamata innocent.Hidekos first reaction was to cry.When the judge said that the defendant is not guilty, I was elated; I was in tears, she says.I am not a tearful person, but mytearsjust flowed without stopping for about an hour.Hostage justiceThe courts conclusion that evidence against Mr Hakamata was fabricated raises troubling questions.Japan has a 99% conviction rate, and a system of so-called hostage justice which, according to Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch, denies people arrested their rights to a presumption of innocence, a prompt and fair bail hearing, and access to counsel during questioning.These abusive practices have resulted in lives and families being torn apart, as well as wrongful convictions, Ms Doi noted in 2023.David T Johnson, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose research focuses on criminal justice in Japan, has followed the Hakamata case for the last 30 years.He said one reason it dragged on is that critical evidence for the defence was not disclosed to them until around 2010.The failure was egregious and inexcusable, Mr Johnson told the BBC. Judges kept kicking the case down the road, as they frequently do in response to retrial petitions (because) they are busy, and the law allows them to do so.Hideko campaigned for years for her brothers retrialHidekosays the core of the injustice was the forced confession and the coercion her brother suffered.But Mr Johnson says false accusations dont happen because of a single mistake. Instead, they are compounded by failings at all levels  from the police right through to the prosecutors, courts and parliament.Judges have the last word, he added. When a wrongful conviction occurs, it is, in the end, because they said so. All too often, the responsibility of judges for producing and maintaining wrongful convictions gets neglected, elided, and ignored.Against that backdrop, Mr Hakamatas acquittal was a watershed  a rare moment of retrospective justice.After declaring Mr Hakamata innocent, the judge presiding over his retrial apologised toHidekofor how long it took to achieve justice.A short while later, Takayoshi Tsuda, chief of Shizuoka police, visitedherhome and bowed in front of both brother and sister.For the past 58 years we caused you indescribable anxiety and burden, Mr Tsuda said. We are truly sorry.Hideko gave an unexpected reply to the police chief.We believe that everything that happened was our destiny, she said.We will not complain about anything now.The pink doorAfter nearly 60 years of anxiety and heartache, Hideko has styled her home with the express intention of letting some light in. The rooms are bright and inviting, filled with pictures of her and Iwaoalongside family friends and supporters.Hideko laughs as she shares memories of her cute little brother as a baby, leafing through black-and-white family photos.The youngest of six siblings, he seems to always be standing next to her.We were always together when we were children, she explains.I always knew I had to take care of my little brother.And so, it continues.She walks into Mr Hakamatas room and introduces their ginger cat, which occupies the chair he normally sits in. Then she points to pictures of him as a young professional boxer.He wanted to become a champion, she says.

When it finally did, it was Hidekowho appeared in court, pleading for her brothers life.Mr Hakamatas fate hinged on the stains, and specifically how they had aged.The prosecution had claimed the stains were reddish when the clothes were recovered  but the defence argued that blood would have turned blackish after being immersed in miso for so long.That was enough to convince presiding judgeKoshi Kunii, who declared that the investigating authority had added blood stains and hid the items in the miso tank well after the incident took place.Judge Kunii further found that other evidence had been fabricated, including an investigation record, and declared Mr Hakamata innocent.Hidekos first reaction was to cry.When the judge said that the defendant is not guilty, I was elated; I was in tears, she says.I am not a tearful person, but mytearsjust flowed without stopping for about an hour.Hostage justiceThe courts conclusion that evidence against Mr Hakamata was fabricated raises troubling questions.Japan has a 99% conviction rate, and a system of so-called hostage justice which, according to Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch, denies people arrested their rights to a presumption of innocence, a prompt and fair bail hearing, and access to counsel during questioning.These abusive practices have resulted in lives and families being torn apart, as well as wrongful convictions, Ms Doi noted in 2023.David T Johnson, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose research focuses on criminal justice in Japan, has followed the Hakamata case for the last 30 years.He said one reason it dragged on is that critical evidence for the defence was not disclosed to them until around 2010.The failure was egregious and inexcusable, Mr Johnson told the BBC. Judges kept kicking the case down the road, as they frequently do in response to retrial petitions (because) they are busy, and the law allows them to do so.Hideko campaigned for years for her brothers retrialHidekosays the core of the injustice was the forced confession and the coercion her brother suffered.But Mr Johnson says false accusations dont happen because of a single mistake. Instead, they are compounded by failings at all levels  from the police right through to the prosecutors, courts and parliament.Judges have the last word, he added. When a wrongful conviction occurs, it is, in the end, because they said so. All too often, the responsibility of judges for producing and maintaining wrongful convictions gets neglected, elided, and ignored.Against that backdrop, Mr Hakamatas acquittal was a watershed  a rare moment of retrospective justice.After declaring Mr Hakamata innocent, the judge presiding over his retrial apologised toHidekofor how long it took to achieve justice.A short while later, Takayoshi Tsuda, chief of Shizuoka police, visitedherhome and bowed in front of both brother and sister.For the past 58 years we caused you indescribable anxiety and burden, Mr Tsuda said. We are truly sorry.Hideko gave an unexpected reply to the police chief.We believe that everything that happened was our destiny, she said.We will not complain about anything now.The pink doorAfter nearly 60 years of anxiety and heartache, Hideko has styled her home with the express intention of letting some light in. The rooms are bright and inviting, filled with pictures of her and Iwaoalongside family friends and supporters.Hideko laughs as she shares memories of her cute little brother as a baby, leafing through black-and-white family photos.The youngest of six siblings, he seems to always be standing next to her.We were always together when we were children, she explains.I always knew I had to take care of my little brother.And so, it continues.She walks into Mr Hakamatas room and introduces their ginger cat, which occupies the chair he normally sits in. Then she points to pictures of him as a young professional boxer.He wanted to become a champion, she says. Then the incident happened.After Mr Hakamata was released in 2014, Hideko wanted to make the apartment as bright as possible, she explains. So she painted the front door pink.I believed that if he was in a bright room and had a cheerful life, he would naturally get well.Its the first thing one notices when visiting Hidekos apartment, this bright pink statement of hope and resilience.Its unclear whether it has worked  Mr Hakamata still paces back and forth for hours, just as he did for years in a jail cell the size of three single tatami mats.But Hideko refuses to linger on the question of what their lives might have looked like if not for such an egregious miscarriage of justice.When asked who she blames for her brothers suffering, she replies: no-one.Complaining about what happened will get us nowhere.Her priority now is to keep her brother comfortable. She shaves his face, massages his head, slices apples and apricots for his breakfast each morning.Hideko, who has spent the majority of her 91 years fighting for her brothers freedom, says this was their fate.I dont want to think about the past. I dont know how long Im going to live, she says.I just want Iwao to live a peaceful and quiet life.\n\nThe family home was searched, as well as the homes of their two elder sisters, and Mr Hakamata was taken away.\n\nHe initially denied all charges, but later gave what he came to describe as a coerced confession following beatings and interrogations that lasted up to 12 hours a day.Two years after his arrest, MrHakamata was convicted of murder and arson and sentenced to death. It was when he was moved to a cell on death row that Hideko noticed a shift in his demeanour.One prison visit in particular stands out.He told me, there was an execution yesterday  it was a person in the next cell, she recalls.He told me to take care  and from then on, he completely changed mentally and became very quiet.Mr Hakamata is not the only one to be damaged by life on Japans death row, where inmates wake each morning not knowing if it will be their last.Between 08:00 and 08:30 in the morning was the most critical time, because that was generally when prisoners were notified of their execution, Menda Sakae, who spent 34 years on death row before being exonerated, wrote in a book about his experience.You begin to feel the most terrible anxiety, because you dont know if they are going to stop in front of your cell. It is impossible to express how awful a feeling this was.James Welsh, lead author of a 2009 Amnesty International report into conditions on death row, noted that the daily threat of imminent death is cruel, inhuman and degrading.The report concluded that inmates were at risk of significant mental health issues.Hideko could only watch as her own brothers mental health deteriorated as the years went by.Once he asked me Do you know who I am? I said, Yes, I do. You are Iwao Hakamata. No, he said, you must be here to see a different person. And he just went back [to his cell].Hideko stepped up as his primary spokesperson and advocate.

I said, Yes, I do. You are Iwao Hakamata. No, he said, you must be here to see a different person. And he just went back [to his cell].Hideko stepped up as his primary spokesperson and advocate. It wasnt until 2014, however, that there was a breakthrough in his case.Hideko, 91, says she always felt the need to protect her little brotherA key piece of evidence against Mr Hakamata were red-stained clothes found in a miso tank at his workplace.They were recovered a year and two months after the murders and the prosecution said they belonged to him. But for years Mr Hakamatas defence team argued that the DNA recovered from the clothes did not match his  and alleged that the evidence was planted.In 2014 they were able to persuade a judge to release him from prison and grant him a retrial.Prolonged legal proceedings meant it took until last October for the retrial to begin. When it finally did, it was Hidekowho appeared in court, pleading for her brothers life.Mr Hakamatas fate hinged on the stains, and specifically how they had aged.The prosecution had claimed the stains were reddish when the clothes were recovered  but the defence argued that blood would have turned blackish after being immersed in miso for so long.That was enough to convince presiding judgeKoshi Kunii, who declared that the investigating authority had added blood stains and hid the items in the miso tank well after the incident took place.Judge Kunii further found that other evidence had been fabricated, including an investigation record, and declared Mr Hakamata innocent.Hidekos first reaction was to cry.When the judge said that the defendant is not guilty, I was elated; I was in tears, she says.I am not a tearful person, but mytearsjust flowed without stopping for about an hour.Hostage justiceThe courts conclusion that evidence against Mr Hakamata was fabricated raises troubling questions.Japan has a 99% conviction rate, and a system of so-called hostage justice which, according to Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch, denies people arrested their rights to a presumption of innocence, a prompt and fair bail hearing, and access to counsel during questioning.These abusive practices have resulted in lives and families being torn apart, as well as wrongful convictions, Ms Doi noted in 2023.David T Johnson, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose research focuses on criminal justice in Japan, has followed the Hakamata case for the last 30 years.He said one reason it dragged on is that critical evidence for the defence was not disclosed to them until around 2010.The failure was egregious and inexcusable, Mr Johnson told the BBC. Judges kept kicking the case down the road, as they frequently do in response to retrial petitions (because) they are busy, and the law allows them to do so.Hideko campaigned for years for her brothers retrialHidekosays the core of the injustice was the forced confession and the coercion her brother suffered.But Mr Johnson says false accusations dont happen because of a single mistake. Instead, they are compounded by failings at all levels  from the police right through to the prosecutors, courts and parliament.Judges have the last word, he added. When a wrongful conviction occurs, it is, in the end, because they said so. All too often, the responsibility of judges for producing and maintaining wrongful convictions gets neglected, elided, and ignored.Against that backdrop, Mr Hakamatas acquittal was a watershed  a rare moment of retrospective justice.After declaring Mr Hakamata innocent, the judge presiding over his retrial apologised toHidekofor how long it took to achieve justice.A short while later, Takayoshi Tsuda, chief of Shizuoka police, visitedherhome and bowed in front of both brother and sister.For the past 58 years we caused you indescribable anxiety and burden, Mr Tsuda said. We are truly sorry.Hideko gave an unexpected reply to the police chief.We believe that everything that happened was our destiny, she said.We will not complain about anything now.The pink doorAfter nearly 60 years of anxiety and heartache, Hideko has styled her home with the express intention of letting some light in. The rooms are bright and inviting, filled with pictures of her and Iwaoalongside family friends and supporters.Hideko laughs as she shares memories of her cute little brother as a baby, leafing through black-and-white family photos.The youngest of six siblings, he seems to always be standing next to her.We were always together when we were children, she explains.I always knew I had to take care of my little brother.And so, it continues.She walks into Mr Hakamatas room and introduces their ginger cat, which occupies the chair he normally sits in. Then she points to pictures of him as a young professional boxer.He wanted to become a champion, she says. Then the incident happened.After Mr Hakamata was released in 2014, Hideko wanted to make the apartment as bright as possible, she explains. So she painted the front door pink.I believed that if he was in a bright room and had a cheerful life, he would naturally get well.Its the first thing one notices when visiting Hidekos apartment, this bright pink statement of hope and resilience.Its unclear whether it has worked  Mr Hakamata still paces back and forth for hours, just as he did for years in a jail cell the size of three single tatami mats.But Hideko refuses to linger on the question of what their lives might have looked like if not for such an egregious miscarriage of justice.When asked who she blames for her brothers suffering, she replies: no-one.Complaining about what happened will get us nowhere.Her priority now is to keep her brother comfortable. She shaves his face, massages his head, slices apples and apricots for his breakfast each morning.Hideko, who has spent the majority of her 91 years fighting for her brothers freedom, says this was their fate.I dont want to think about the past.

When it finally did, it was Hidekowho appeared in court, pleading for her brothers life.Mr Hakamatas fate hinged on the stains, and specifically how they had aged.The prosecution had claimed the stains were reddish when the clothes were recovered  but the defence argued that blood would have turned blackish after being immersed in miso for so long.That was enough to convince presiding judgeKoshi Kunii, who declared that the investigating authority had added blood stains and hid the items in the miso tank well after the incident took place.Judge Kunii further found that other evidence had been fabricated, including an investigation record, and declared Mr Hakamata innocent.Hidekos first reaction was to cry.When the judge said that the defendant is not guilty, I was elated; I was in tears, she says.I am not a tearful person, but mytearsjust flowed without stopping for about an hour.Hostage justiceThe courts conclusion that evidence against Mr Hakamata was fabricated raises troubling questions.Japan has a 99% conviction rate, and a system of so-called hostage justice which, according to Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch, denies people arrested their rights to a presumption of innocence, a prompt and fair bail hearing, and access to counsel during questioning.These abusive practices have resulted in lives and families being torn apart, as well as wrongful convictions, Ms Doi noted in 2023.David T Johnson, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose research focuses on criminal justice in Japan, has followed the Hakamata case for the last 30 years.He said one reason it dragged on is that critical evidence for the defence was not disclosed to them until around 2010.The failure was egregious and inexcusable, Mr Johnson told the BBC. Judges kept kicking the case down the road, as they frequently do in response to retrial petitions (because) they are busy, and the law allows them to do so.Hideko campaigned for years for her brothers retrialHidekosays the core of the injustice was the forced confession and the coercion her brother suffered.But Mr Johnson says false accusations dont happen because of a single mistake. Instead, they are compounded by failings at all levels  from the police right through to the prosecutors, courts and parliament.Judges have the last word, he added. When a wrongful conviction occurs, it is, in the end, because they said so. All too often, the responsibility of judges for producing and maintaining wrongful convictions gets neglected, elided, and ignored.Against that backdrop, Mr Hakamatas acquittal was a watershed  a rare moment of retrospective justice.After declaring Mr Hakamata innocent, the judge presiding over his retrial apologised toHidekofor how long it took to achieve justice.A short while later, Takayoshi Tsuda, chief of Shizuoka police, visitedherhome and bowed in front of both brother and sister.For the past 58 years we caused you indescribable anxiety and burden, Mr Tsuda said. We are truly sorry.Hideko gave an unexpected reply to the police chief.We believe that everything that happened was our destiny, she said.We will not complain about anything now.The pink doorAfter nearly 60 years of anxiety and heartache, Hideko has styled her home with the express intention of letting some light in. The rooms are bright and inviting, filled with pictures of her and Iwaoalongside family friends and supporters.Hideko laughs as she shares memories of her cute little brother as a baby, leafing through black-and-white family photos.The youngest of six siblings, he seems to always be standing next to her.We were always together when we were children, she explains.I always knew I had to take care of my little brother.And so, it continues.She walks into Mr Hakamatas room and introduces their ginger cat, which occupies the chair he normally sits in. Then she points to pictures of him as a young professional boxer.He wanted to become a champion, she says. Then the incident happened.After Mr Hakamata was released in 2014, Hideko wanted to make the apartment as bright as possible, she explains. So she painted the front door pink.I believed that if he was in a bright room and had a cheerful life, he would naturally get well.Its the first thing one notices when visiting Hidekos apartment, this bright pink statement of hope and resilience.Its unclear whether it has worked  Mr Hakamata still paces back and forth for hours, just as he did for years in a jail cell the size of three single tatami mats.But Hideko refuses to linger on the question of what their lives might have looked like if not for such an egregious miscarriage of justice.When asked who she blames for her brothers suffering, she replies: no-one.Complaining about what happened will get us nowhere.Her priority now is to keep her brother comfortable. She shaves his face, massages his head, slices apples and apricots for his breakfast each morning.Hideko, who has spent the majority of her 91 years fighting for her brothers freedom, says this was their fate.I dont want to think about the past. I dont know how long Im going to live, she says.I just want Iwao to live a peaceful and quiet life.\n\nThe report concluded that inmates were at risk of significant mental health issues.\n\nHideko could only watch as her own brothers mental health deteriorated as the years went by.Once he asked me Do you know who I am?

The rooms are bright and inviting, filled with pictures of her and Iwaoalongside family friends and supporters.Hideko laughs as she shares memories of her cute little brother as a baby, leafing through black-and-white family photos.The youngest of six siblings, he seems to always be standing next to her.We were always together when we were children, she explains.I always knew I had to take care of my little brother.And so, it continues.She walks into Mr Hakamatas room and introduces their ginger cat, which occupies the chair he normally sits in. Then she points to pictures of him as a young professional boxer.He wanted to become a champion, she says. Then the incident happened.After Mr Hakamata was released in 2014, Hideko wanted to make the apartment as bright as possible, she explains. So she painted the front door pink.I believed that if he was in a bright room and had a cheerful life, he would naturally get well.Its the first thing one notices when visiting Hidekos apartment, this bright pink statement of hope and resilience.Its unclear whether it has worked  Mr Hakamata still paces back and forth for hours, just as he did for years in a jail cell the size of three single tatami mats.But Hideko refuses to linger on the question of what their lives might have looked like if not for such an egregious miscarriage of justice.When asked who she blames for her brothers suffering, she replies: no-one.Complaining about what happened will get us nowhere.Her priority now is to keep her brother comfortable. She shaves his face, massages his head, slices apples and apricots for his breakfast each morning.Hideko, who has spent the majority of her 91 years fighting for her brothers freedom, says this was their fate.I dont want to think about the past. I dont know how long Im going to live, she says.I just want Iwao to live a peaceful and quiet life.\n\nBut Mr Johnson says false accusations dont happen because of a single mistake. Instead, they are compounded by failings at all levels  from the police right through to the prosecutors, courts and parliament.\n\nJudges have the last word, he added.

            "content": "By IOL\n\nGRATEFUL to be alive, the Hollywood icon peeled back the covers on his mystery medical setback in April 2003 with his observational humour intermingled with raw emotions that, at times, left him choked up with emotion.\n\nOf course, there was no better vehicle to share his story than through comedy  his bedrock in the industry.His Netflix special, What Had Happened Was, saw the award-winning actor, who is also a revered singer, unpack his journey to fans in Atlanta.Interestingly, he was filming Back in Action with Cameron Diaz around the time that the life-changing incident happened.At the time, his protective eldest daughter Corinne Foxx clamped down on paparazzi by stating that he was hospitalised for a medical complication.Of course, it was only fitting that Corinne introduced her beloved dad on stage for the show.Counting his blessing, he said: Im happy to be alive.What made it more special was that his life was saved by a white doctor wearing a Lakers jersey.He admitted: It is a mystery, we still dont know exactly what happened to me. I was having a bad headache, and I asked my boy for an aspirin. Before I could get the aspirin, I went out. I dont remember 20 days.What they told me was they took me to the first doctor, and they gave me a cortisone shot and sent me home.I dont know if you can do Yelps for doctors but thats half a star. My sister said No. Four foot eleven, and full of nothing but love, she said somethings wrong with my brother.The tenacity of his sister Deidra Dixon made a huge difference in saving his life as she took him to Piedmont Hospital where Dr Schuette explained that he was having a brain bleed that led to a stroke.Of course, he addressed the conspiracy theories around his illness, which varied from it being linked to the Covid vaccine to his dying.There were also whispers of him being poisoned by beleaguered rap mogul Sean Diddy Combs.Jamie laughed off the intimation.He responded: The internet said Puffy tried to kill me. Hell no, I left those parties early. Something dont look right, its slippery in here.In his routine, which, at times, veered into a diary session, Jamie revealed how he refused to believe what happened to him. He didnt want to acknowledge that he couldnt walk or that he needed personal care.He also unpacked how the experience led him to reconnect with God, bond with his family and humbled him.There was a very touching moment when he brought his shy youngest daughter Annelise onto the stage after sharing how she snuck into his room and started playing her guitar, which helped stabilise his vitals.At the time, it was all over the place and the staff were unsure of how they could get it down.He called her strumming his spiritual defibrillator.Their short duet on stage left the audience fighting back the tears as it came to light that she was determined to have her father pull through so they could play again.Jamie also added that he was so blessed to be able to walk Corinne down the aisle a few months back.While there were solemn moments on the show, Jamie offset the heaviness with jokes about Dave Chappelle, Jay-Z as well as some of the staff who took care of him  one of whom was the one that saw his pickle while in rehab.He also recalled getting a hug from Halle Berry and what it meant to him. Of course, he milked the humour out of their interaction as only he could.And he also made it very clear that he was not going to be dating white women again. Not sure if Katie Holmes got the memo.Jamie also flexed his powerful vocals with a playful song.This comedy special was Jamie setting the record straight, acknowledging the journey and lessons he learned while also reminding the audience of his legacy in the industry.He added: I never let go of my sense of humour. If I can stay funny, I can stay alive.Ultimately, this comedy special is also a celebration of life. Its got humour, heartfelt emotion and raw honesty.\n\nOf course, there was no better vehicle to share his story than through comedy  his bedrock in the industry.\n\nHis Netflix special, What Had Happened Was, saw the award-winning actor, who is also a revered singer, unpack his journey to fans in Atlanta.Interestingly, he was filming Back in Action with Cameron Diaz around the time that the life-changing incident happened.At the time, his protective eldest daughter Corinne Foxx clamped down on paparazzi by stating that he was hospitalised for a medical complication.Of course, it was only fitting that Corinne introduced her beloved dad on stage for the show.Counting his blessing, he said: Im happy to be alive.What made it more special was that his life was saved by a white doctor wearing a Lakers jersey.He admitted: It is a mystery, we still dont know exactly what happened to me.

            "content": "By Robert Lansing Institute\n\nTHERE has been significant resistance to extending the term of President Emmerson Mnangagwa beyond 2028 within Zimbabwes ruling Zanu PF party.\n\nMnangagwa, who has said repeatedly that he does not intend to extend his presidency beyond two terms, is facing internal party divisions, with some advocating for a Constitutional amendment to remove term limits.In October this year Zanu PF Annual Peoples Conference in Bulawayo passed a resolution to perpetuate President Emmerson Mnangagwas rule beyond 2028 when his constitutionally permissible two terms come to an end.While Mnangagwa has several paths to securing a third term, each scenario comes with significant risks, including domestic unrest, weakened democratic institutions, and international isolation.The approach he chooses will depend on the political landscape, the strength of opposition forces, and his ability to consolidate power within Zanu PF and State institutions.The ED2030 slogan has not only left ordinary Zimbabweans on the edge but has also divided opinion among party activists. The move, however, is reportedly opposed by the military and war veterans.The 21st annual conference of Zanu PF started with a Politburo meeting at the party headquarters, with discussions on leadership issues and possible term extensions expected.President Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe, who secured his second term in the 2023 elections, is constitutionally limited to two five-year terms. Despite this, there is growing speculation and internal lobbying within the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu PF) for him to pursue a third term.For Mnangagwa to seek a third term, constitutional changes would be necessary. This would involve repealing or altering the current two-term limit, a process that requires significant political maneuvering and legislative approval.Notably, Zanu PF has passed resolutions supporting the extension of presidential terms, indicating a willingness to pursue such amendments.Party Support: Mnangagwas inner circle is actively lobbying for a third term, reflecting internal party dynamics favoring the extension of his presidency.Reasons Behind the Push for a Third Term: Power Consolidation: Mnangagwas tenure has been marked by efforts to consolidate power, and a third term would further entrench his leadership and the dominance of Zanu PF. This continuation could suppress emerging opposition and maintain the status quo.Economic and Political Stability: Extending Mnangagwas presidency could provide continuity, which they believe is essential for implementing long-term economic policies and maintaining political stability.Personal Ambitions and Legacy: Like many long-serving leaders, Mnangagwa may be driven by a desire to leave a lasting legacy, viewing a prolonged tenure as an opportunity to shape Zimbabwes future according to his vision.Challenges and Considerations:Constitutional Legitimacy: Amending the constitution to allow a third term could face legal challenges and would likely require a national referendum, posing significant hurdles.Public Opinion: There is potential for public resistance, as citizens may view the move as undermining democratic principles, leading to civil unrest or increased support for opposition movements.International Relations: Pursuing a third term could attract criticism from the international community, potentially resulting in diplomatic isolation or economic sanctions, further impacting Zimbabwes economy.In conclusion, while there is a concerted effort within Zanu PF to facilitate President Mnangagwas bid for a third term, significant constitutional, legal, and societal obstacles remain. The success of such a bid would depend on navigating these challenges and gauging the broader implications for Zimbabwes democratic institutions and international standing.If President Emmerson Mnangagwa were to pursue and secure a third term in office, the move could have profound and potentially negative implications for democracy in Zimbabwe:1. Erosion of ConstitutionalismWeakening of Term Limits: Allowing Mnangagwa to extend his presidency beyond the constitutional two-term limit would undermine the principle of term limits, a key safeguard against authoritarianism. This could set a precedent for future leaders to manipulate the constitution for personal gain.Loss of Credibility: The Constitution would lose its integrity as a foundational document if amendments are perceived as serving the interests of the ruling elite rather than the public good.2. Concentration of PowerStrengthened Executive Authority: A third term would further consolidate power in the executive branch, marginalizing other institutions like the judiciary and parliament.Suppression of Opposition: The move would likely be accompanied by increased repression of opposition parties and dissenting voices to secure Mnangagwas continued rule.3. Decline in Electoral IntegrityElections as Formalities: With term limits removed, elections could become symbolic exercises rather than genuine democratic contests, as the ruling party tightens its grip on the electoral process.Public Disillusionment: Citizens may lose faith in the electoral system, viewing it as rigged to favor the incumbent, leading to voter apathy or unrest.4. Increased Risk of AuthoritarianismDynastic Tendencies: Prolonged rule by Mnangagwa could foster a culture of strongman politics, reducing Zimbabwes chances of transitioning to a pluralistic and inclusive political system.Suppression of Civil Liberties: The government might resort to more draconian measures to maintain control, further curtailing freedoms of speech, assembly, and the press.5. Weakening of Democratic InstitutionsPartisan Institutions: Key state institutions, including the judiciary and electoral bodies, could become increasingly partisan, eroding their independence and accountability.Rule of Law Undermined: Constitutional amendments driven by personal or political motives could diminish the rule of law, making it subservient to political expediency.6. Potential for Civil UnrestPublic Backlash: Moves to extend Mnangagwas rule could provoke widespread protests, particularly among younger and urban populations disillusioned with the lack of democratic progress.Heightened Political Tensions: An extended presidency might exacerbate divisions within the country, including within ZANU-PF, where rival factions may challenge Mnangagwas authority.7. Impact on International RelationsLoss of Credibility Abroad: Zimbabwes reputation as a democratic state would suffer, potentially leading to greater isolation from Western democracies and international organizations.Economic Consequences: Sanctions and reduced foreign investment could follow, further weakening the countrys struggling economy and exacerbating public dissatisfaction.8. Precedent for the RegionRipple Effects in Southern Africa: If Mnangagwa succeeds in extending his term, it could embolden other leaders in the region to seek similar changes, undermining democratic norms across Southern Africa.ConclusionPursuing a third term would likely accelerate the erosion of democratic principles in Zimbabwe, entrench authoritarian practices, and deepen public distrust in governance. While it might solidify Mnangagwas control in the short term, it risks long-term instability, economic decline, and the further marginalization of Zimbabwe on the global stage.Several foreign actors may have vested interests in Emmerson Mnangagwa securing a third term in office. These interests are shaped by geopolitical considerations, economic partnerships, and regional dynamics:1. ChinaEconomic Interests:China has significant investments in Zimbabwe, particularly in mining, infrastructure, and agriculture. Mnangagwas continued leadership ensures policy continuity and a favorable environment for Chinese enterprises.Zimbabwes rich natural resources, such as platinum and lithium, are critical to Chinas strategic economic goals, including its global supply chains.Strategic Partnership:Beijing values Mnangagwas support for its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and his governments alignment with Chinas development model, which prioritizes state-led growth over Western-style liberal democracy.2. RussiaMilitary and Resource Ties:Russia has developed close ties with Zimbabwe in areas like military cooperation and resource extraction, including mining. Mnangagwas leadership provides Moscow with a stable partner to expand its influence in Southern Africa.Political Alignment:Zimbabwes alignment with Russia on key international issues, including support for Russia in the United Nations, makes Mnangagwas continued rule advantageous for Moscow.3. South AfricaRegional Stability:As Zimbabwes neighbor and largest trading partner, South Africa has a vested interest in stability. Mnangagwas leadership, while controversial, might be viewed as less destabilizing compared to a potential leadership vacuum or a contested transition.Migration Concerns:South Africa already faces challenges from Zimbabwean migrants fleeing economic hardships. A power struggle or instability could exacerbate migration pressures, something Pretoria seeks to avoid.4. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Resource Access:The UAE has shown interest in Zimbabwes gold and other natural resources. Mnangagwas government has facilitated agreements that allow UAE companies to operate in Zimbabwe, creating a mutually beneficial relationship.Political Influence:The UAE may prefer a leader like Mnangagwa who can maintain centralized control, ensuring predictability for its business ventures.5. African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC)Avoiding Precedents of Instability:Both the AU and SADC prioritize stability and may support Mnangagwa as a means of avoiding potential conflict or political turmoil in Zimbabwe, which could destabilize the region.6. Emerging Actors: India and TurkeyExpanding Influence:Both India and Turkey are seeking to deepen their presence in Africa. Mnangagwas continued leadership offers an opportunity to build on existing relationships and expand their economic and diplomatic footprints in Zimbabwe.Key Motivations of Foreign ActorsEconomic Gain: Access to Zimbabwes abundant natural resources, including gold, platinum, and lithium.Geopolitical Leverage: Strengthening alliances in Africa to counter Western influence.Stability Over Democracy: Prioritizing stable, predictable governance over democratic reforms to protect investments and regional interests.ConclusionWhile Western democracies may view a third term for Mnangagwa as a setback for democracy, actors like China, Russia, and the UAE likely see it as an opportunity to maintain favorable relations and secure their economic and strategic interests in Zimbabwe. Regional players like South Africa may prioritize stability, even if it comes at the expense of democratic principles.Securing a third term for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Zimbabwe would likely require strategic political maneuvering, constitutional changes, and suppression of opposition. Below are potential scenarios through which Mnangagwa might secure a third term:1. Constitutional AmendmentLegal Changes:The ruling ZANU-PF party could push for an amendment to the constitution to remove or extend the presidential term limits.With ZANU-PFs parliamentary majority, they could achieve the two-thirds vote required to pass such an amendment.Referendum Option:Alternatively, the government could call for a national referendum, presenting the amendment as necessary for stability or continuity.Challenges:Resistance from opposition parties and civil society.Risk of backlash from the international community, which may impose sanctions or withdraw support.2. Judicial InterventionCourt Ruling on Term Limits:Mnangagwa could leverage the judiciary to interpret term limits in a way that allows him to run again, possibly arguing that his first term under the new constitution (post-2018) doesnt count toward the limit.Influence Over Judiciary:Zimbabwes judiciary has faced accusations of partisanship, and Mnangagwas administration could use this to its advantage.Challenges:Loss of public trust in judicial independence.Potential for civil unrest if the public perceives the ruling as illegitimate.3. ZANU-PF Internal ConsolidationParty Endorsement:Mnangagwa could secure ZANU-PFs internal support by rallying key factions, sidelining rivals, and promising benefits to influential party members.Crushing Dissent:Any internal opposition, such as factions loyal to Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, could be suppressed through political or legal means.Challenges:Risk of factional splits within ZANU-PF.Weakened internal unity could lead to instability.4. Manipulation of Electoral ProcessesElection Engineering:The regime could manipulate the electoral process, ensuring Mnangagwas victory regardless of constitutional constraints.Tactics could include voter intimidation, suppression of opposition campaigns, and control over electoral commissions.Post-Election Legitimization:Following the election, ZANU-PF could argue that the will of the people supersedes constitutional term limits.Challenges:Loss of credibility in the electoral system.Risk of mass protests or violent backlash from opposition supporters.5. National Emergency or Crisis JustificationState of Emergency:Mnangagwa could declare a national emergency, citing economic challenges, political unrest, or foreign interference, to justify extending his term without elections.Delaying Elections:Using a crisis as a pretext, elections could be postponed indefinitely, allowing Mnangagwa to remain in power.Challenges:Requires significant control over security forces and public perception.Could lead to international condemnation and domestic unrest.6. International Support or Neutralization of OppositionForeign Backing:Leveraging relationships with key international allies like China, Russia, or South Africa to legitimize his continued rule.Co-Opting Opposition:Weakening or dividing the opposition through financial inducements, arrests, or propaganda campaigns.Challenges:Maintaining foreign support while avoiding alienation from Western powers and international organizations.7. Popular Campaign for ContinuityPublic Relations Effort:Launching a campaign to portray Mnangagwa as the indispensable leader who can maintain stability and economic progress.Mobilizing grassroots support through Zanu PF structures and allied organizations.\n\nMnangagwa, who has said repeatedly that he does not intend to extend his presidency beyond two terms, is facing internal party divisions, with some advocating for a Constitutional amendment to remove term limits.\n\nIn October this year Zanu PF Annual Peoples Conference in Bulawayo passed a resolution to perpetuate President Emmerson Mnangagwas rule beyond 2028 when his constitutionally permissible two terms come to an end.While Mnangagwa has several paths to securing a third term, each scenario comes with significant risks, including domestic unrest, weakened democratic institutions, and international isolation.The approach he chooses will depend on the political landscape, the strength of opposition forces, and his ability to consolidate power within Zanu PF and State institutions.The ED2030 slogan has not only left ordinary Zimbabweans on the edge but has also divided opinion among party activists.

Popular Campaign for ContinuityPublic Relations Effort:Launching a campaign to portray Mnangagwa as the indispensable leader who can maintain stability and economic progress.Mobilizing grassroots support through Zanu PF structures and allied organizations.\n\nWhile Mnangagwa has several paths to securing a third term, each scenario comes with significant risks, including domestic unrest, weakened democratic institutions, and international isolation.\n\nThe approach he chooses will depend on the political landscape, the strength of opposition forces, and his ability to consolidate power within Zanu PF and State institutions.The ED2030 slogan has not only left ordinary Zimbabweans on the edge but has also divided opinion among party activists. The move, however, is reportedly opposed by the military and war veterans.The 21st annual conference of Zanu PF started with a Politburo meeting at the party headquarters, with discussions on leadership issues and possible term extensions expected.President Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe, who secured his second term in the 2023 elections, is constitutionally limited to two five-year terms. Despite this, there is growing speculation and internal lobbying within the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu PF) for him to pursue a third term.For Mnangagwa to seek a third term, constitutional changes would be necessary. This would involve repealing or altering the current two-term limit, a process that requires significant political maneuvering and legislative approval.Notably, Zanu PF has passed resolutions supporting the extension of presidential terms, indicating a willingness to pursue such amendments.Party Support: Mnangagwas inner circle is actively lobbying for a third term, reflecting internal party dynamics favoring the extension of his presidency.Reasons Behind the Push for a Third Term: Power Consolidation: Mnangagwas tenure has been marked by efforts to consolidate power, and a third term would further entrench his leadership and the dominance of Zanu PF. This continuation could suppress emerging opposition and maintain the status quo.Economic and Political Stability: Extending Mnangagwas presidency could provide continuity, which they believe is essential for implementing long-term economic policies and maintaining political stability.Personal Ambitions and Legacy: Like many long-serving leaders, Mnangagwa may be driven by a desire to leave a lasting legacy, viewing a prolonged tenure as an opportunity to shape Zimbabwes future according to his vision.Challenges and Considerations:Constitutional Legitimacy: Amending the constitution to allow a third term could face legal challenges and would likely require a national referendum, posing significant hurdles.Public Opinion: There is potential for public resistance, as citizens may view the move as undermining democratic principles, leading to civil unrest or increased support for opposition movements.International Relations: Pursuing a third term could attract criticism from the international community, potentially resulting in diplomatic isolation or economic sanctions, further impacting Zimbabwes economy.In conclusion, while there is a concerted effort within Zanu PF to facilitate President Mnangagwas bid for a third term, significant constitutional, legal, and societal obstacles remain. The success of such a bid would depend on navigating these challenges and gauging the broader implications for Zimbabwes democratic institutions and international standing.If President Emmerson Mnangagwa were to pursue and secure a third term in office, the move could have profound and potentially negative implications for democracy in Zimbabwe:1. Erosion of ConstitutionalismWeakening of Term Limits: Allowing Mnangagwa to extend his presidency beyond the constitutional two-term limit would undermine the principle of term limits, a key safeguard against authoritarianism. This could set a precedent for future leaders to manipulate the constitution for personal gain.Loss of Credibility: The Constitution would lose its integrity as a foundational document if amendments are perceived as serving the interests of the ruling elite rather than the public good.2. Concentration of PowerStrengthened Executive Authority: A third term would further consolidate power in the executive branch, marginalizing other institutions like the judiciary and parliament.Suppression of Opposition: The move would likely be accompanied by increased repression of opposition parties and dissenting voices to secure Mnangagwas continued rule.3. Decline in Electoral IntegrityElections as Formalities: With term limits removed, elections could become symbolic exercises rather than genuine democratic contests, as the ruling party tightens its grip on the electoral process.Public Disillusionment: Citizens may lose faith in the electoral system, viewing it as rigged to favor the incumbent, leading to voter apathy or unrest.4. Increased Risk of AuthoritarianismDynastic Tendencies: Prolonged rule by Mnangagwa could foster a culture of strongman politics, reducing Zimbabwes chances of transitioning to a pluralistic and inclusive political system.Suppression of Civil Liberties: The government might resort to more draconian measures to maintain control, further curtailing freedoms of speech, assembly, and the press.5. Weakening of Democratic InstitutionsPartisan Institutions: Key state institutions, including the judiciary and electoral bodies, could become increasingly partisan, eroding their independence and accountability.Rule of Law Undermined: Constitutional amendments driven by personal or political motives could diminish the rule of law, making it subservient to political expediency.6. Potential for Civil UnrestPublic Backlash: Moves to extend Mnangagwas rule could provoke widespread protests, particularly among younger and urban populations disillusioned with the lack of democratic progress.Heightened Political Tensions: An extended presidency might exacerbate divisions within the country, including within ZANU-PF, where rival factions may challenge Mnangagwas authority.7. Impact on International RelationsLoss of Credibility Abroad: Zimbabwes reputation as a democratic state would suffer, potentially leading to greater isolation from Western democracies and international organizations.Economic Consequences: Sanctions and reduced foreign investment could follow, further weakening the countrys struggling economy and exacerbating public dissatisfaction.8. Precedent for the RegionRipple Effects in Southern Africa: If Mnangagwa succeeds in extending his term, it could embolden other leaders in the region to seek similar changes, undermining democratic norms across Southern Africa.ConclusionPursuing a third term would likely accelerate the erosion of democratic principles in Zimbabwe, entrench authoritarian practices, and deepen public distrust in governance. While it might solidify Mnangagwas control in the short term, it risks long-term instability, economic decline, and the further marginalization of Zimbabwe on the global stage.Several foreign actors may have vested interests in Emmerson Mnangagwa securing a third term in office. These interests are shaped by geopolitical considerations, economic partnerships, and regional dynamics:1. ChinaEconomic Interests:China has significant investments in Zimbabwe, particularly in mining, infrastructure, and agriculture. Mnangagwas continued leadership ensures policy continuity and a favorable environment for Chinese enterprises.Zimbabwes rich natural resources, such as platinum and lithium, are critical to Chinas strategic economic goals, including its global supply chains.Strategic Partnership:Beijing values Mnangagwas support for its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and his governments alignment with Chinas development model, which prioritizes state-led growth over Western-style liberal democracy.2. RussiaMilitary and Resource Ties:Russia has developed close ties with Zimbabwe in areas like military cooperation and resource extraction, including mining. Mnangagwas leadership provides Moscow with a stable partner to expand its influence in Southern Africa.Political Alignment:Zimbabwes alignment with Russia on key international issues, including support for Russia in the United Nations, makes Mnangagwas continued rule advantageous for Moscow.3. South AfricaRegional Stability:As Zimbabwes neighbor and largest trading partner, South Africa has a vested interest in stability. Mnangagwas leadership, while controversial, might be viewed as less destabilizing compared to a potential leadership vacuum or a contested transition.Migration Concerns:South Africa already faces challenges from Zimbabwean migrants fleeing economic hardships. A power struggle or instability could exacerbate migration pressures, something Pretoria seeks to avoid.4. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Resource Access:The UAE has shown interest in Zimbabwes gold and other natural resources. Mnangagwas government has facilitated agreements that allow UAE companies to operate in Zimbabwe, creating a mutually beneficial relationship.Political Influence:The UAE may prefer a leader like Mnangagwa who can maintain centralized control, ensuring predictability for its business ventures.5. African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC)Avoiding Precedents of Instability:Both the AU and SADC prioritize stability and may support Mnangagwa as a means of avoiding potential conflict or political turmoil in Zimbabwe, which could destabilize the region.6. Emerging Actors: India and TurkeyExpanding Influence:Both India and Turkey are seeking to deepen their presence in Africa. Mnangagwas continued leadership offers an opportunity to build on existing relationships and expand their economic and diplomatic footprints in Zimbabwe.Key Motivations of Foreign ActorsEconomic Gain: Access to Zimbabwes abundant natural resources, including gold, platinum, and lithium.Geopolitical Leverage: Strengthening alliances in Africa to counter Western influence.Stability Over Democracy: Prioritizing stable, predictable governance over democratic reforms to protect investments and regional interests.ConclusionWhile Western democracies may view a third term for Mnangagwa as a setback for democracy, actors like China, Russia, and the UAE likely see it as an opportunity to maintain favorable relations and secure their economic and strategic interests in Zimbabwe. Regional players like South Africa may prioritize stability, even if it comes at the expense of democratic principles.Securing a third term for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Zimbabwe would likely require strategic political maneuvering, constitutional changes, and suppression of opposition. Below are potential scenarios through which Mnangagwa might secure a third term:1. Constitutional AmendmentLegal Changes:The ruling ZANU-PF party could push for an amendment to the constitution to remove or extend the presidential term limits.With ZANU-PFs parliamentary majority, they could achieve the two-thirds vote required to pass such an amendment.Referendum Option:Alternatively, the government could call for a national referendum, presenting the amendment as necessary for stability or continuity.Challenges:Resistance from opposition parties and civil society.Risk of backlash from the international community, which may impose sanctions or withdraw support.2. Judicial InterventionCourt Ruling on Term Limits:Mnangagwa could leverage the judiciary to interpret term limits in a way that allows him to run again, possibly arguing that his first term under the new constitution (post-2018) doesnt count toward the limit.Influence Over Judiciary:Zimbabwes judiciary has faced accusations of partisanship, and Mnangagwas administration could use this to its advantage.Challenges:Loss of public trust in judicial independence.Potential for civil unrest if the public perceives the ruling as illegitimate.3. ZANU-PF Internal ConsolidationParty Endorsement:Mnangagwa could secure ZANU-PFs internal support by rallying key factions, sidelining rivals, and promising benefits to influential party members.Crushing Dissent:Any internal opposition, such as factions loyal to Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, could be suppressed through political or legal means.Challenges:Risk of factional splits within ZANU-PF.Weakened internal unity could lead to instability.4. Manipulation of Electoral ProcessesElection Engineering:The regime could manipulate the electoral process, ensuring Mnangagwas victory regardless of constitutional constraints.Tactics could include voter intimidation, suppression of opposition campaigns, and control over electoral commissions.Post-Election Legitimization:Following the election, ZANU-PF could argue that the will of the people supersedes constitutional term limits.Challenges:Loss of credibility in the electoral system.Risk of mass protests or violent backlash from opposition supporters.5. National Emergency or Crisis JustificationState of Emergency:Mnangagwa could declare a national emergency, citing economic challenges, political unrest, or foreign interference, to justify extending his term without elections.Delaying Elections:Using a crisis as a pretext, elections could be postponed indefinitely, allowing Mnangagwa to remain in power.Challenges:Requires significant control over security forces and public perception.Could lead to international condemnation and domestic unrest.6.

This continuation could suppress emerging opposition and maintain the status quo.Economic and Political Stability: Extending Mnangagwas presidency could provide continuity, which they believe is essential for implementing long-term economic policies and maintaining political stability.Personal Ambitions and Legacy: Like many long-serving leaders, Mnangagwa may be driven by a desire to leave a lasting legacy, viewing a prolonged tenure as an opportunity to shape Zimbabwes future according to his vision.Challenges and Considerations:Constitutional Legitimacy: Amending the constitution to allow a third term could face legal challenges and would likely require a national referendum, posing significant hurdles.Public Opinion: There is potential for public resistance, as citizens may view the move as undermining democratic principles, leading to civil unrest or increased support for opposition movements.International Relations: Pursuing a third term could attract criticism from the international community, potentially resulting in diplomatic isolation or economic sanctions, further impacting Zimbabwes economy.In conclusion, while there is a concerted effort within Zanu PF to facilitate President Mnangagwas bid for a third term, significant constitutional, legal, and societal obstacles remain. The success of such a bid would depend on navigating these challenges and gauging the broader implications for Zimbabwes democratic institutions and international standing.If President Emmerson Mnangagwa were to pursue and secure a third term in office, the move could have profound and potentially negative implications for democracy in Zimbabwe:1. Erosion of ConstitutionalismWeakening of Term Limits: Allowing Mnangagwa to extend his presidency beyond the constitutional two-term limit would undermine the principle of term limits, a key safeguard against authoritarianism. This could set a precedent for future leaders to manipulate the constitution for personal gain.Loss of Credibility: The Constitution would lose its integrity as a foundational document if amendments are perceived as serving the interests of the ruling elite rather than the public good.2. Concentration of PowerStrengthened Executive Authority: A third term would further consolidate power in the executive branch, marginalizing other institutions like the judiciary and parliament.Suppression of Opposition: The move would likely be accompanied by increased repression of opposition parties and dissenting voices to secure Mnangagwas continued rule.3. Decline in Electoral IntegrityElections as Formalities: With term limits removed, elections could become symbolic exercises rather than genuine democratic contests, as the ruling party tightens its grip on the electoral process.Public Disillusionment: Citizens may lose faith in the electoral system, viewing it as rigged to favor the incumbent, leading to voter apathy or unrest.4. Increased Risk of AuthoritarianismDynastic Tendencies: Prolonged rule by Mnangagwa could foster a culture of strongman politics, reducing Zimbabwes chances of transitioning to a pluralistic and inclusive political system.Suppression of Civil Liberties: The government might resort to more draconian measures to maintain control, further curtailing freedoms of speech, assembly, and the press.5. Weakening of Democratic InstitutionsPartisan Institutions: Key state institutions, including the judiciary and electoral bodies, could become increasingly partisan, eroding their independence and accountability.Rule of Law Undermined: Constitutional amendments driven by personal or political motives could diminish the rule of law, making it subservient to political expediency.6. Potential for Civil UnrestPublic Backlash: Moves to extend Mnangagwas rule could provoke widespread protests, particularly among younger and urban populations disillusioned with the lack of democratic progress.Heightened Political Tensions: An extended presidency might exacerbate divisions within the country, including within ZANU-PF, where rival factions may challenge Mnangagwas authority.7. Impact on International RelationsLoss of Credibility Abroad: Zimbabwes reputation as a democratic state would suffer, potentially leading to greater isolation from Western democracies and international organizations.Economic Consequences: Sanctions and reduced foreign investment could follow, further weakening the countrys struggling economy and exacerbating public dissatisfaction.8. Precedent for the RegionRipple Effects in Southern Africa: If Mnangagwa succeeds in extending his term, it could embolden other leaders in the region to seek similar changes, undermining democratic norms across Southern Africa.ConclusionPursuing a third term would likely accelerate the erosion of democratic principles in Zimbabwe, entrench authoritarian practices, and deepen public distrust in governance. While it might solidify Mnangagwas control in the short term, it risks long-term instability, economic decline, and the further marginalization of Zimbabwe on the global stage.Several foreign actors may have vested interests in Emmerson Mnangagwa securing a third term in office. These interests are shaped by geopolitical considerations, economic partnerships, and regional dynamics:1. ChinaEconomic Interests:China has significant investments in Zimbabwe, particularly in mining, infrastructure, and agriculture. Mnangagwas continued leadership ensures policy continuity and a favorable environment for Chinese enterprises.Zimbabwes rich natural resources, such as platinum and lithium, are critical to Chinas strategic economic goals, including its global supply chains.Strategic Partnership:Beijing values Mnangagwas support for its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and his governments alignment with Chinas development model, which prioritizes state-led growth over Western-style liberal democracy.2. RussiaMilitary and Resource Ties:Russia has developed close ties with Zimbabwe in areas like military cooperation and resource extraction, including mining. Mnangagwas leadership provides Moscow with a stable partner to expand its influence in Southern Africa.Political Alignment:Zimbabwes alignment with Russia on key international issues, including support for Russia in the United Nations, makes Mnangagwas continued rule advantageous for Moscow.3. South AfricaRegional Stability:As Zimbabwes neighbor and largest trading partner, South Africa has a vested interest in stability. Mnangagwas leadership, while controversial, might be viewed as less destabilizing compared to a potential leadership vacuum or a contested transition.Migration Concerns:South Africa already faces challenges from Zimbabwean migrants fleeing economic hardships. A power struggle or instability could exacerbate migration pressures, something Pretoria seeks to avoid.4. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Resource Access:The UAE has shown interest in Zimbabwes gold and other natural resources. Mnangagwas government has facilitated agreements that allow UAE companies to operate in Zimbabwe, creating a mutually beneficial relationship.Political Influence:The UAE may prefer a leader like Mnangagwa who can maintain centralized control, ensuring predictability for its business ventures.5. African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC)Avoiding Precedents of Instability:Both the AU and SADC prioritize stability and may support Mnangagwa as a means of avoiding potential conflict or political turmoil in Zimbabwe, which could destabilize the region.6. Emerging Actors: India and TurkeyExpanding Influence:Both India and Turkey are seeking to deepen their presence in Africa. Mnangagwas continued leadership offers an opportunity to build on existing relationships and expand their economic and diplomatic footprints in Zimbabwe.Key Motivations of Foreign ActorsEconomic Gain: Access to Zimbabwes abundant natural resources, including gold, platinum, and lithium.Geopolitical Leverage: Strengthening alliances in Africa to counter Western influence.Stability Over Democracy: Prioritizing stable, predictable governance over democratic reforms to protect investments and regional interests.ConclusionWhile Western democracies may view a third term for Mnangagwa as a setback for democracy, actors like China, Russia, and the UAE likely see it as an opportunity to maintain favorable relations and secure their economic and strategic interests in Zimbabwe. Regional players like South Africa may prioritize stability, even if it comes at the expense of democratic principles.Securing a third term for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Zimbabwe would likely require strategic political maneuvering, constitutional changes, and suppression of opposition. Below are potential scenarios through which Mnangagwa might secure a third term:1. Constitutional AmendmentLegal Changes:The ruling ZANU-PF party could push for an amendment to the constitution to remove or extend the presidential term limits.With ZANU-PFs parliamentary majority, they could achieve the two-thirds vote required to pass such an amendment.Referendum Option:Alternatively, the government could call for a national referendum, presenting the amendment as necessary for stability or continuity.Challenges:Resistance from opposition parties and civil society.Risk of backlash from the international community, which may impose sanctions or withdraw support.2. Judicial InterventionCourt Ruling on Term Limits:Mnangagwa could leverage the judiciary to interpret term limits in a way that allows him to run again, possibly arguing that his first term under the new constitution (post-2018) doesnt count toward the limit.Influence Over Judiciary:Zimbabwes judiciary has faced accusations of partisanship, and Mnangagwas administration could use this to its advantage.Challenges:Loss of public trust in judicial independence.Potential for civil unrest if the public perceives the ruling as illegitimate.3. ZANU-PF Internal ConsolidationParty Endorsement:Mnangagwa could secure ZANU-PFs internal support by rallying key factions, sidelining rivals, and promising benefits to influential party members.Crushing Dissent:Any internal opposition, such as factions loyal to Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, could be suppressed through political or legal means.Challenges:Risk of factional splits within ZANU-PF.Weakened internal unity could lead to instability.4. Manipulation of Electoral ProcessesElection Engineering:The regime could manipulate the electoral process, ensuring Mnangagwas victory regardless of constitutional constraints.Tactics could include voter intimidation, suppression of opposition campaigns, and control over electoral commissions.Post-Election Legitimization:Following the election, ZANU-PF could argue that the will of the people supersedes constitutional term limits.Challenges:Loss of credibility in the electoral system.Risk of mass protests or violent backlash from opposition supporters.5. National Emergency or Crisis JustificationState of Emergency:Mnangagwa could declare a national emergency, citing economic challenges, political unrest, or foreign interference, to justify extending his term without elections.Delaying Elections:Using a crisis as a pretext, elections could be postponed indefinitely, allowing Mnangagwa to remain in power.Challenges:Requires significant control over security forces and public perception.Could lead to international condemnation and domestic unrest.6. International Support or Neutralization of OppositionForeign Backing:Leveraging relationships with key international allies like China, Russia, or South Africa to legitimize his continued rule.Co-Opting Opposition:Weakening or dividing the opposition through financial inducements, arrests, or propaganda campaigns.Challenges:Maintaining foreign support while avoiding alienation from Western powers and international organizations.7. Popular Campaign for ContinuityPublic Relations Effort:Launching a campaign to portray Mnangagwa as the indispensable leader who can maintain stability and economic progress.Mobilizing grassroots support through Zanu PF structures and allied organizations.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe, who secured his second term in the 2023 elections, is constitutionally limited to two five-year terms.

Precedent for the RegionRipple Effects in Southern Africa: If Mnangagwa succeeds in extending his term, it could embolden other leaders in the region to seek similar changes, undermining democratic norms across Southern Africa.ConclusionPursuing a third term would likely accelerate the erosion of democratic principles in Zimbabwe, entrench authoritarian practices, and deepen public distrust in governance. While it might solidify Mnangagwas control in the short term, it risks long-term instability, economic decline, and the further marginalization of Zimbabwe on the global stage.Several foreign actors may have vested interests in Emmerson Mnangagwa securing a third term in office. These interests are shaped by geopolitical considerations, economic partnerships, and regional dynamics:1. ChinaEconomic Interests:China has significant investments in Zimbabwe, particularly in mining, infrastructure, and agriculture. Mnangagwas continued leadership ensures policy continuity and a favorable environment for Chinese enterprises.Zimbabwes rich natural resources, such as platinum and lithium, are critical to Chinas strategic economic goals, including its global supply chains.Strategic Partnership:Beijing values Mnangagwas support for its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and his governments alignment with Chinas development model, which prioritizes state-led growth over Western-style liberal democracy.2. RussiaMilitary and Resource Ties:Russia has developed close ties with Zimbabwe in areas like military cooperation and resource extraction, including mining. Mnangagwas leadership provides Moscow with a stable partner to expand its influence in Southern Africa.Political Alignment:Zimbabwes alignment with Russia on key international issues, including support for Russia in the United Nations, makes Mnangagwas continued rule advantageous for Moscow.3. South AfricaRegional Stability:As Zimbabwes neighbor and largest trading partner, South Africa has a vested interest in stability. Mnangagwas leadership, while controversial, might be viewed as less destabilizing compared to a potential leadership vacuum or a contested transition.Migration Concerns:South Africa already faces challenges from Zimbabwean migrants fleeing economic hardships. A power struggle or instability could exacerbate migration pressures, something Pretoria seeks to avoid.4. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Resource Access:The UAE has shown interest in Zimbabwes gold and other natural resources. Mnangagwas government has facilitated agreements that allow UAE companies to operate in Zimbabwe, creating a mutually beneficial relationship.Political Influence:The UAE may prefer a leader like Mnangagwa who can maintain centralized control, ensuring predictability for its business ventures.5. African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC)Avoiding Precedents of Instability:Both the AU and SADC prioritize stability and may support Mnangagwa as a means of avoiding potential conflict or political turmoil in Zimbabwe, which could destabilize the region.6. Emerging Actors: India and TurkeyExpanding Influence:Both India and Turkey are seeking to deepen their presence in Africa. Mnangagwas continued leadership offers an opportunity to build on existing relationships and expand their economic and diplomatic footprints in Zimbabwe.Key Motivations of Foreign ActorsEconomic Gain: Access to Zimbabwes abundant natural resources, including gold, platinum, and lithium.Geopolitical Leverage: Strengthening alliances in Africa to counter Western influence.Stability Over Democracy: Prioritizing stable, predictable governance over democratic reforms to protect investments and regional interests.ConclusionWhile Western democracies may view a third term for Mnangagwa as a setback for democracy, actors like China, Russia, and the UAE likely see it as an opportunity to maintain favorable relations and secure their economic and strategic interests in Zimbabwe. Regional players like South Africa may prioritize stability, even if it comes at the expense of democratic principles.Securing a third term for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Zimbabwe would likely require strategic political maneuvering, constitutional changes, and suppression of opposition. Below are potential scenarios through which Mnangagwa might secure a third term:1. Constitutional AmendmentLegal Changes:The ruling ZANU-PF party could push for an amendment to the constitution to remove or extend the presidential term limits.With ZANU-PFs parliamentary majority, they could achieve the two-thirds vote required to pass such an amendment.Referendum Option:Alternatively, the government could call for a national referendum, presenting the amendment as necessary for stability or continuity.Challenges:Resistance from opposition parties and civil society.Risk of backlash from the international community, which may impose sanctions or withdraw support.2. Judicial InterventionCourt Ruling on Term Limits:Mnangagwa could leverage the judiciary to interpret term limits in a way that allows him to run again, possibly arguing that his first term under the new constitution (post-2018) doesnt count toward the limit.Influence Over Judiciary:Zimbabwes judiciary has faced accusations of partisanship, and Mnangagwas administration could use this to its advantage.Challenges:Loss of public trust in judicial independence.Potential for civil unrest if the public perceives the ruling as illegitimate.3. ZANU-PF Internal ConsolidationParty Endorsement:Mnangagwa could secure ZANU-PFs internal support by rallying key factions, sidelining rivals, and promising benefits to influential party members.Crushing Dissent:Any internal opposition, such as factions loyal to Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, could be suppressed through political or legal means.Challenges:Risk of factional splits within ZANU-PF.Weakened internal unity could lead to instability.4. Manipulation of Electoral ProcessesElection Engineering:The regime could manipulate the electoral process, ensuring Mnangagwas victory regardless of constitutional constraints.Tactics could include voter intimidation, suppression of opposition campaigns, and control over electoral commissions.Post-Election Legitimization:Following the election, ZANU-PF could argue that the will of the people supersedes constitutional term limits.Challenges:Loss of credibility in the electoral system.Risk of mass protests or violent backlash from opposition supporters.5. National Emergency or Crisis JustificationState of Emergency:Mnangagwa could declare a national emergency, citing economic challenges, political unrest, or foreign interference, to justify extending his term without elections.Delaying Elections:Using a crisis as a pretext, elections could be postponed indefinitely, allowing Mnangagwa to remain in power.Challenges:Requires significant control over security forces and public perception.Could lead to international condemnation and domestic unrest.6. International Support or Neutralization of OppositionForeign Backing:Leveraging relationships with key international allies like China, Russia, or South Africa to legitimize his continued rule.Co-Opting Opposition:Weakening or dividing the opposition through financial inducements, arrests, or propaganda campaigns.Challenges:Maintaining foreign support while avoiding alienation from Western powers and international organizations.7. Popular Campaign for ContinuityPublic Relations Effort:Launching a campaign to portray Mnangagwa as the indispensable leader who can maintain stability and economic progress.Mobilizing grassroots support through Zanu PF structures and allied organizations.\n\nParty Support: Mnangagwas inner circle is actively lobbying for a third term, reflecting internal party dynamics favoring the extension of his presidency.\n\nReasons Behind the Push for a Third Term: Power Consolidation: Mnangagwas tenure has been marked by efforts to consolidate power, and a third term would further entrench his leadership and the dominance of Zanu PF. This continuation could suppress emerging opposition and maintain the status quo.Economic and Political Stability: Extending Mnangagwas presidency could provide continuity, which they believe is essential for implementing long-term economic policies and maintaining political stability.Personal Ambitions and Legacy: Like many long-serving leaders, Mnangagwa may be driven by a desire to leave a lasting legacy, viewing a prolonged tenure as an opportunity to shape Zimbabwes future according to his vision.Challenges and Considerations:Constitutional Legitimacy: Amending the constitution to allow a third term could face legal challenges and would likely require a national referendum, posing significant hurdles.Public Opinion: There is potential for public resistance, as citizens may view the move as undermining democratic principles, leading to civil unrest or increased support for opposition movements.International Relations: Pursuing a third term could attract criticism from the international community, potentially resulting in diplomatic isolation or economic sanctions, further impacting Zimbabwes economy.In conclusion, while there is a concerted effort within Zanu PF to facilitate President Mnangagwas bid for a third term, significant constitutional, legal, and societal obstacles remain. The success of such a bid would depend on navigating these challenges and gauging the broader implications for Zimbabwes democratic institutions and international standing.If President Emmerson Mnangagwa were to pursue and secure a third term in office, the move could have profound and potentially negative implications for democracy in Zimbabwe:1. Erosion of ConstitutionalismWeakening of Term Limits: Allowing Mnangagwa to extend his presidency beyond the constitutional two-term limit would undermine the principle of term limits, a key safeguard against authoritarianism. This could set a precedent for future leaders to manipulate the constitution for personal gain.Loss of Credibility: The Constitution would lose its integrity as a foundational document if amendments are perceived as serving the interests of the ruling elite rather than the public good.2. Concentration of PowerStrengthened Executive Authority: A third term would further consolidate power in the executive branch, marginalizing other institutions like the judiciary and parliament.Suppression of Opposition: The move would likely be accompanied by increased repression of opposition parties and dissenting voices to secure Mnangagwas continued rule.3. Decline in Electoral IntegrityElections as Formalities: With term limits removed, elections could become symbolic exercises rather than genuine democratic contests, as the ruling party tightens its grip on the electoral process.Public Disillusionment: Citizens may lose faith in the electoral system, viewing it as rigged to favor the incumbent, leading to voter apathy or unrest.4. Increased Risk of AuthoritarianismDynastic Tendencies: Prolonged rule by Mnangagwa could foster a culture of strongman politics, reducing Zimbabwes chances of transitioning to a pluralistic and inclusive political system.Suppression of Civil Liberties: The government might resort to more draconian measures to maintain control, further curtailing freedoms of speech, assembly, and the press.5. Weakening of Democratic InstitutionsPartisan Institutions: Key state institutions, including the judiciary and electoral bodies, could become increasingly partisan, eroding their independence and accountability.Rule of Law Undermined: Constitutional amendments driven by personal or political motives could diminish the rule of law, making it subservient to political expediency.6. Potential for Civil UnrestPublic Backlash: Moves to extend Mnangagwas rule could provoke widespread protests, particularly among younger and urban populations disillusioned with the lack of democratic progress.Heightened Political Tensions: An extended presidency might exacerbate divisions within the country, including within ZANU-PF, where rival factions may challenge Mnangagwas authority.7.

The success of such a bid would depend on navigating these challenges and gauging the broader implications for Zimbabwes democratic institutions and international standing.If President Emmerson Mnangagwa were to pursue and secure a third term in office, the move could have profound and potentially negative implications for democracy in Zimbabwe:1. Erosion of ConstitutionalismWeakening of Term Limits: Allowing Mnangagwa to extend his presidency beyond the constitutional two-term limit would undermine the principle of term limits, a key safeguard against authoritarianism.

Decline in Electoral IntegrityElections as Formalities: With term limits removed, elections could become symbolic exercises rather than genuine democratic contests, as the ruling party tightens its grip on the electoral process.Public Disillusionment: Citizens may lose faith in the electoral system, viewing it as rigged to favor the incumbent, leading to voter apathy or unrest.4. Increased Risk of AuthoritarianismDynastic Tendencies: Prolonged rule by Mnangagwa could foster a culture of strongman politics, reducing Zimbabwes chances of transitioning to a pluralistic and inclusive political system.Suppression of Civil Liberties: The government might resort to more draconian measures to maintain control, further curtailing freedoms of speech, assembly, and the press.5. Weakening of Democratic InstitutionsPartisan Institutions: Key state institutions, including the judiciary and electoral bodies, could become increasingly partisan, eroding their independence and accountability.Rule of Law Undermined: Constitutional amendments driven by personal or political motives could diminish the rule of law, making it subservient to political expediency.6. Potential for Civil UnrestPublic Backlash: Moves to extend Mnangagwas rule could provoke widespread protests, particularly among younger and urban populations disillusioned with the lack of democratic progress.Heightened Political Tensions: An extended presidency might exacerbate divisions within the country, including within ZANU-PF, where rival factions may challenge Mnangagwas authority.7. Impact on International RelationsLoss of Credibility Abroad: Zimbabwes reputation as a democratic state would suffer, potentially leading to greater isolation from Western democracies and international organizations.Economic Consequences: Sanctions and reduced foreign investment could follow, further weakening the countrys struggling economy and exacerbating public dissatisfaction.8. Precedent for the RegionRipple Effects in Southern Africa: If Mnangagwa succeeds in extending his term, it could embolden other leaders in the region to seek similar changes, undermining democratic norms across Southern Africa.ConclusionPursuing a third term would likely accelerate the erosion of democratic principles in Zimbabwe, entrench authoritarian practices, and deepen public distrust in governance. While it might solidify Mnangagwas control in the short term, it risks long-term instability, economic decline, and the further marginalization of Zimbabwe on the global stage.Several foreign actors may have vested interests in Emmerson Mnangagwa securing a third term in office. These interests are shaped by geopolitical considerations, economic partnerships, and regional dynamics:1. ChinaEconomic Interests:China has significant investments in Zimbabwe, particularly in mining, infrastructure, and agriculture. Mnangagwas continued leadership ensures policy continuity and a favorable environment for Chinese enterprises.Zimbabwes rich natural resources, such as platinum and lithium, are critical to Chinas strategic economic goals, including its global supply chains.Strategic Partnership:Beijing values Mnangagwas support for its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and his governments alignment with Chinas development model, which prioritizes state-led growth over Western-style liberal democracy.2. RussiaMilitary and Resource Ties:Russia has developed close ties with Zimbabwe in areas like military cooperation and resource extraction, including mining. Mnangagwas leadership provides Moscow with a stable partner to expand its influence in Southern Africa.Political Alignment:Zimbabwes alignment with Russia on key international issues, including support for Russia in the United Nations, makes Mnangagwas continued rule advantageous for Moscow.3. South AfricaRegional Stability:As Zimbabwes neighbor and largest trading partner, South Africa has a vested interest in stability. Mnangagwas leadership, while controversial, might be viewed as less destabilizing compared to a potential leadership vacuum or a contested transition.Migration Concerns:South Africa already faces challenges from Zimbabwean migrants fleeing economic hardships. A power struggle or instability could exacerbate migration pressures, something Pretoria seeks to avoid.4. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Resource Access:The UAE has shown interest in Zimbabwes gold and other natural resources.

African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC)Avoiding Precedents of Instability:Both the AU and SADC prioritize stability and may support Mnangagwa as a means of avoiding potential conflict or political turmoil in Zimbabwe, which could destabilize the region.6. Emerging Actors: India and TurkeyExpanding Influence:Both India and Turkey are seeking to deepen their presence in Africa. Mnangagwas continued leadership offers an opportunity to build on existing relationships and expand their economic and diplomatic footprints in Zimbabwe.Key Motivations of Foreign ActorsEconomic Gain: Access to Zimbabwes abundant natural resources, including gold, platinum, and lithium.Geopolitical Leverage: Strengthening alliances in Africa to counter Western influence.Stability Over Democracy: Prioritizing stable, predictable governance over democratic reforms to protect investments and regional interests.ConclusionWhile Western democracies may view a third term for Mnangagwa as a setback for democracy, actors like China, Russia, and the UAE likely see it as an opportunity to maintain favorable relations and secure their economic and strategic interests in Zimbabwe. Regional players like South Africa may prioritize stability, even if it comes at the expense of democratic principles.Securing a third term for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Zimbabwe would likely require strategic political maneuvering, constitutional changes, and suppression of opposition. Below are potential scenarios through which Mnangagwa might secure a third term:1. Constitutional AmendmentLegal Changes:The ruling ZANU-PF party could push for an amendment to the constitution to remove or extend the presidential term limits.With ZANU-PFs parliamentary majority, they could achieve the two-thirds vote required to pass such an amendment.Referendum Option:Alternatively, the government could call for a national referendum, presenting the amendment as necessary for stability or continuity.Challenges:Resistance from opposition parties and civil society.Risk of backlash from the international community, which may impose sanctions or withdraw support.2.

Mnangagwas government has facilitated agreements that allow UAE companies to operate in Zimbabwe, creating a mutually beneficial relationship.Political Influence:The UAE may prefer a leader like Mnangagwa who can maintain centralized control, ensuring predictability for its business ventures.5. African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC)Avoiding Precedents of Instability:Both the AU and SADC prioritize stability and may support Mnangagwa as a means of avoiding potential conflict or political turmoil in Zimbabwe, which could destabilize the region.6. Emerging Actors: India and TurkeyExpanding Influence:Both India and Turkey are seeking to deepen their presence in Africa. Mnangagwas continued leadership offers an opportunity to build on existing relationships and expand their economic and diplomatic footprints in Zimbabwe.Key Motivations of Foreign ActorsEconomic Gain: Access to Zimbabwes abundant natural resources, including gold, platinum, and lithium.Geopolitical Leverage: Strengthening alliances in Africa to counter Western influence.Stability Over Democracy: Prioritizing stable, predictable governance over democratic reforms to protect investments and regional interests.ConclusionWhile Western democracies may view a third term for Mnangagwa as a setback for democracy, actors like China, Russia, and the UAE likely see it as an opportunity to maintain favorable relations and secure their economic and strategic interests in Zimbabwe. Regional players like South Africa may prioritize stability, even if it comes at the expense of democratic principles.Securing a third term for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Zimbabwe would likely require strategic political maneuvering, constitutional changes, and suppression of opposition. Below are potential scenarios through which Mnangagwa might secure a third term:1. Constitutional AmendmentLegal Changes:The ruling ZANU-PF party could push for an amendment to the constitution to remove or extend the presidential term limits.With ZANU-PFs parliamentary majority, they could achieve the two-thirds vote required to pass such an amendment.Referendum Option:Alternatively, the government could call for a national referendum, presenting the amendment as necessary for stability or continuity.Challenges:Resistance from opposition parties and civil society.Risk of backlash from the international community, which may impose sanctions or withdraw support.2. Judicial InterventionCourt Ruling on Term Limits:Mnangagwa could leverage the judiciary to interpret term limits in a way that allows him to run again, possibly arguing that his first term under the new constitution (post-2018) doesnt count toward the limit.Influence Over Judiciary:Zimbabwes judiciary has faced accusations of partisanship, and Mnangagwas administration could use this to its advantage.Challenges:Loss of public trust in judicial independence.Potential for civil unrest if the public perceives the ruling as illegitimate.3. ZANU-PF Internal ConsolidationParty Endorsement:Mnangagwa could secure ZANU-PFs internal support by rallying key factions, sidelining rivals, and promising benefits to influential party members.Crushing Dissent:Any internal opposition, such as factions loyal to Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, could be suppressed through political or legal means.Challenges:Risk of factional splits within ZANU-PF.Weakened internal unity could lead to instability.4. Manipulation of Electoral ProcessesElection Engineering:The regime could manipulate the electoral process, ensuring Mnangagwas victory regardless of constitutional constraints.Tactics could include voter intimidation, suppression of opposition campaigns, and control over electoral commissions.Post-Election Legitimization:Following the election, ZANU-PF could argue that the will of the people supersedes constitutional term limits.Challenges:Loss of credibility in the electoral system.Risk of mass protests or violent backlash from opposition supporters.5. National Emergency or Crisis JustificationState of Emergency:Mnangagwa could declare a national emergency, citing economic challenges, political unrest, or foreign interference, to justify extending his term without elections.Delaying Elections:Using a crisis as a pretext, elections could be postponed indefinitely, allowing Mnangagwa to remain in power.Challenges:Requires significant control over security forces and public perception.Could lead to international condemnation and domestic unrest.6. International Support or Neutralization of OppositionForeign Backing:Leveraging relationships with key international allies like China, Russia, or South Africa to legitimize his continued rule.Co-Opting Opposition:Weakening or dividing the opposition through financial inducements, arrests, or propaganda campaigns.Challenges:Maintaining foreign support while avoiding alienation from Western powers and international organizations.7. Popular Campaign for ContinuityPublic Relations Effort:Launching a campaign to portray Mnangagwa as the indispensable leader who can maintain stability and economic progress.Mobilizing grassroots support through Zanu PF structures and allied organizations.\n\nInternational Relations: Pursuing a third term could attract criticism from the international community, potentially resulting in diplomatic isolation or economic sanctions, further impacting Zimbabwes economy.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is a concerted effort within Zanu PF to facilitate President Mnangagwas bid for a third term, significant constitutional, legal, and societal obstacles remain. The success of such a bid would depend on navigating these challenges and gauging the broader implications for Zimbabwes democratic institutions and international standing.If President Emmerson Mnangagwa were to pursue and secure a third term in office, the move could have profound and potentially negative implications for democracy in Zimbabwe:1. Erosion of ConstitutionalismWeakening of Term Limits: Allowing Mnangagwa to extend his presidency beyond the constitutional two-term limit would undermine the principle of term limits, a key safeguard against authoritarianism. This could set a precedent for future leaders to manipulate the constitution for personal gain.Loss of Credibility: The Constitution would lose its integrity as a foundational document if amendments are perceived as serving the interests of the ruling elite rather than the public good.2. Concentration of PowerStrengthened Executive Authority: A third term would further consolidate power in the executive branch, marginalizing other institutions like the judiciary and parliament.Suppression of Opposition: The move would likely be accompanied by increased repression of opposition parties and dissenting voices to secure Mnangagwas continued rule.3. Decline in Electoral IntegrityElections as Formalities: With term limits removed, elections could become symbolic exercises rather than genuine democratic contests, as the ruling party tightens its grip on the electoral process.Public Disillusionment: Citizens may lose faith in the electoral system, viewing it as rigged to favor the incumbent, leading to voter apathy or unrest.4. Increased Risk of AuthoritarianismDynastic Tendencies: Prolonged rule by Mnangagwa could foster a culture of strongman politics, reducing Zimbabwes chances of transitioning to a pluralistic and inclusive political system.Suppression of Civil Liberties: The government might resort to more draconian measures to maintain control, further curtailing freedoms of speech, assembly, and the press.5. Weakening of Democratic InstitutionsPartisan Institutions: Key state institutions, including the judiciary and electoral bodies, could become increasingly partisan, eroding their independence and accountability.Rule of Law Undermined: Constitutional amendments driven by personal or political motives could diminish the rule of law, making it subservient to political expediency.6. Potential for Civil UnrestPublic Backlash: Moves to extend Mnangagwas rule could provoke widespread protests, particularly among younger and urban populations disillusioned with the lack of democratic progress.Heightened Political Tensions: An extended presidency might exacerbate divisions within the country, including within ZANU-PF, where rival factions may challenge Mnangagwas authority.7. Impact on International RelationsLoss of Credibility Abroad: Zimbabwes reputation as a democratic state would suffer, potentially leading to greater isolation from Western democracies and international organizations.Economic Consequences: Sanctions and reduced foreign investment could follow, further weakening the countrys struggling economy and exacerbating public dissatisfaction.8. Precedent for the RegionRipple Effects in Southern Africa: If Mnangagwa succeeds in extending his term, it could embolden other leaders in the region to seek similar changes, undermining democratic norms across Southern Africa.ConclusionPursuing a third term would likely accelerate the erosion of democratic principles in Zimbabwe, entrench authoritarian practices, and deepen public distrust in governance. While it might solidify Mnangagwas control in the short term, it risks long-term instability, economic decline, and the further marginalization of Zimbabwe on the global stage.Several foreign actors may have vested interests in Emmerson Mnangagwa securing a third term in office. These interests are shaped by geopolitical considerations, economic partnerships, and regional dynamics:1. ChinaEconomic Interests:China has significant investments in Zimbabwe, particularly in mining, infrastructure, and agriculture. Mnangagwas continued leadership ensures policy continuity and a favorable environment for Chinese enterprises.Zimbabwes rich natural resources, such as platinum and lithium, are critical to Chinas strategic economic goals, including its global supply chains.Strategic Partnership:Beijing values Mnangagwas support for its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and his governments alignment with Chinas development model, which prioritizes state-led growth over Western-style liberal democracy.2. RussiaMilitary and Resource Ties:Russia has developed close ties with Zimbabwe in areas like military cooperation and resource extraction, including mining. Mnangagwas leadership provides Moscow with a stable partner to expand its influence in Southern Africa.Political Alignment:Zimbabwes alignment with Russia on key international issues, including support for Russia in the United Nations, makes Mnangagwas continued rule advantageous for Moscow.3. South AfricaRegional Stability:As Zimbabwes neighbor and largest trading partner, South Africa has a vested interest in stability. Mnangagwas leadership, while controversial, might be viewed as less destabilizing compared to a potential leadership vacuum or a contested transition.Migration Concerns:South Africa already faces challenges from Zimbabwean migrants fleeing economic hardships.

African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC)Avoiding Precedents of Instability:Both the AU and SADC prioritize stability and may support Mnangagwa as a means of avoiding potential conflict or political turmoil in Zimbabwe, which could destabilize the region.6. Emerging Actors: India and TurkeyExpanding Influence:Both India and Turkey are seeking to deepen their presence in Africa. Mnangagwas continued leadership offers an opportunity to build on existing relationships and expand their economic and diplomatic footprints in Zimbabwe.Key Motivations of Foreign ActorsEconomic Gain: Access to Zimbabwes abundant natural resources, including gold, platinum, and lithium.Geopolitical Leverage: Strengthening alliances in Africa to counter Western influence.Stability Over Democracy: Prioritizing stable, predictable governance over democratic reforms to protect investments and regional interests.ConclusionWhile Western democracies may view a third term for Mnangagwa as a setback for democracy, actors like China, Russia, and the UAE likely see it as an opportunity to maintain favorable relations and secure their economic and strategic interests in Zimbabwe. Regional players like South Africa may prioritize stability, even if it comes at the expense of democratic principles.Securing a third term for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Zimbabwe would likely require strategic political maneuvering, constitutional changes, and suppression of opposition. Below are potential scenarios through which Mnangagwa might secure a third term:1. Constitutional AmendmentLegal Changes:The ruling ZANU-PF party could push for an amendment to the constitution to remove or extend the presidential term limits.With ZANU-PFs parliamentary majority, they could achieve the two-thirds vote required to pass such an amendment.Referendum Option:Alternatively, the government could call for a national referendum, presenting the amendment as necessary for stability or continuity.Challenges:Resistance from opposition parties and civil society.Risk of backlash from the international community, which may impose sanctions or withdraw support.2. Judicial InterventionCourt Ruling on Term Limits:Mnangagwa could leverage the judiciary to interpret term limits in a way that allows him to run again, possibly arguing that his first term under the new constitution (post-2018) doesnt count toward the limit.Influence Over Judiciary:Zimbabwes judiciary has faced accusations of partisanship, and Mnangagwas administration could use this to its advantage.Challenges:Loss of public trust in judicial independence.Potential for civil unrest if the public perceives the ruling as illegitimate.3. ZANU-PF Internal ConsolidationParty Endorsement:Mnangagwa could secure ZANU-PFs internal support by rallying key factions, sidelining rivals, and promising benefits to influential party members.Crushing Dissent:Any internal opposition, such as factions loyal to Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, could be suppressed through political or legal means.Challenges:Risk of factional splits within ZANU-PF.Weakened internal unity could lead to instability.4. Manipulation of Electoral ProcessesElection Engineering:The regime could manipulate the electoral process, ensuring Mnangagwas victory regardless of constitutional constraints.Tactics could include voter intimidation, suppression of opposition campaigns, and control over electoral commissions.Post-Election Legitimization:Following the election, ZANU-PF could argue that the will of the people supersedes constitutional term limits.Challenges:Loss of credibility in the electoral system.Risk of mass protests or violent backlash from opposition supporters.5. National Emergency or Crisis JustificationState of Emergency:Mnangagwa could declare a national emergency, citing economic challenges, political unrest, or foreign interference, to justify extending his term without elections.Delaying Elections:Using a crisis as a pretext, elections could be postponed indefinitely, allowing Mnangagwa to remain in power.Challenges:Requires significant control over security forces and public perception.Could lead to international condemnation and domestic unrest.6. International Support or Neutralization of OppositionForeign Backing:Leveraging relationships with key international allies like China, Russia, or South Africa to legitimize his continued rule.Co-Opting Opposition:Weakening or dividing the opposition through financial inducements, arrests, or propaganda campaigns.Challenges:Maintaining foreign support while avoiding alienation from Western powers and international organizations.7. Popular Campaign for ContinuityPublic Relations Effort:Launching a campaign to portray Mnangagwa as the indispensable leader who can maintain stability and economic progress.Mobilizing grassroots support through Zanu PF structures and allied organizations.\n\nLoss of Credibility: The Constitution would lose its integrity as a foundational document if amendments are perceived as serving the interests of the ruling elite rather than the public good.\n\n2. Concentration of PowerStrengthened Executive Authority: A third term would further consolidate power in the executive branch, marginalizing other institutions like the judiciary and parliament.Suppression of Opposition: The move would likely be accompanied by increased repression of opposition parties and dissenting voices to secure Mnangagwas continued rule.3. Decline in Electoral IntegrityElections as Formalities: With term limits removed, elections could become symbolic exercises rather than genuine democratic contests, as the ruling party tightens its grip on the electoral process.Public Disillusionment: Citizens may lose faith in the electoral system, viewing it as rigged to favor the incumbent, leading to voter apathy or unrest.4. Increased Risk of AuthoritarianismDynastic Tendencies: Prolonged rule by Mnangagwa could foster a culture of strongman politics, reducing Zimbabwes chances of transitioning to a pluralistic and inclusive political system.Suppression of Civil Liberties: The government might resort to more draconian measures to maintain control, further curtailing freedoms of speech, assembly, and the press.5. Weakening of Democratic InstitutionsPartisan Institutions: Key state institutions, including the judiciary and electoral bodies, could become increasingly partisan, eroding their independence and accountability.Rule of Law Undermined: Constitutional amendments driven by personal or political motives could diminish the rule of law, making it subservient to political expediency.6. Potential for Civil UnrestPublic Backlash: Moves to extend Mnangagwas rule could provoke widespread protests, particularly among younger and urban populations disillusioned with the lack of democratic progress.Heightened Political Tensions: An extended presidency might exacerbate divisions within the country, including within ZANU-PF, where rival factions may challenge Mnangagwas authority.7. Impact on International RelationsLoss of Credibility Abroad: Zimbabwes reputation as a democratic state would suffer, potentially leading to greater isolation from Western democracies and international organizations.Economic Consequences: Sanctions and reduced foreign investment could follow, further weakening the countrys struggling economy and exacerbating public dissatisfaction.8. Precedent for the RegionRipple Effects in Southern Africa: If Mnangagwa succeeds in extending his term, it could embolden other leaders in the region to seek similar changes, undermining democratic norms across Southern Africa.ConclusionPursuing a third term would likely accelerate the erosion of democratic principles in Zimbabwe, entrench authoritarian practices, and deepen public distrust in governance. While it might solidify Mnangagwas control in the short term, it risks long-term instability, economic decline, and the further marginalization of Zimbabwe on the global stage.Several foreign actors may have vested interests in Emmerson Mnangagwa securing a third term in office. These interests are shaped by geopolitical considerations, economic partnerships, and regional dynamics:1. ChinaEconomic Interests:China has significant investments in Zimbabwe, particularly in mining, infrastructure, and agriculture. Mnangagwas continued leadership ensures policy continuity and a favorable environment for Chinese enterprises.Zimbabwes rich natural resources, such as platinum and lithium, are critical to Chinas strategic economic goals, including its global supply chains.Strategic Partnership:Beijing values Mnangagwas support for its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and his governments alignment with Chinas development model, which prioritizes state-led growth over Western-style liberal democracy.2. RussiaMilitary and Resource Ties:Russia has developed close ties with Zimbabwe in areas like military cooperation and resource extraction, including mining. Mnangagwas leadership provides Moscow with a stable partner to expand its influence in Southern Africa.Political Alignment:Zimbabwes alignment with Russia on key international issues, including support for Russia in the United Nations, makes Mnangagwas continued rule advantageous for Moscow.3. South AfricaRegional Stability:As Zimbabwes neighbor and largest trading partner, South Africa has a vested interest in stability. Mnangagwas leadership, while controversial, might be viewed as less destabilizing compared to a potential leadership vacuum or a contested transition.Migration Concerns:South Africa already faces challenges from Zimbabwean migrants fleeing economic hardships. A power struggle or instability could exacerbate migration pressures, something Pretoria seeks to avoid.4.

International Support or Neutralization of OppositionForeign Backing:Leveraging relationships with key international allies like China, Russia, or South Africa to legitimize his continued rule.Co-Opting Opposition:Weakening or dividing the opposition through financial inducements, arrests, or propaganda campaigns.Challenges:Maintaining foreign support while avoiding alienation from Western powers and international organizations.7. Popular Campaign for ContinuityPublic Relations Effort:Launching a campaign to portray Mnangagwa as the indispensable leader who can maintain stability and economic progress.Mobilizing grassroots support through Zanu PF structures and allied organizations.\n\n5. Weakening of Democratic Institutions\n\nPartisan Institutions: Key state institutions, including the judiciary and electoral bodies, could become increasingly partisan, eroding their independence and accountability.\n\nRule of Law Undermined: Constitutional amendments driven by personal or political motives could diminish the rule of law, making it subservient to political expediency.\n\n6. Potential for Civil UnrestPublic Backlash: Moves to extend Mnangagwas rule could provoke widespread protests, particularly among younger and urban populations disillusioned with the lack of democratic progress.Heightened Political Tensions: An extended presidency might exacerbate divisions within the country, including within ZANU-PF, where rival factions may challenge Mnangagwas authority.7. Impact on International RelationsLoss of Credibility Abroad: Zimbabwes reputation as a democratic state would suffer, potentially leading to greater isolation from Western democracies and international organizations.Economic Consequences: Sanctions and reduced foreign investment could follow, further weakening the countrys struggling economy and exacerbating public dissatisfaction.8. Precedent for the RegionRipple Effects in Southern Africa: If Mnangagwa succeeds in extending his term, it could embolden other leaders in the region to seek similar changes, undermining democratic norms across Southern Africa.ConclusionPursuing a third term would likely accelerate the erosion of democratic principles in Zimbabwe, entrench authoritarian practices, and deepen public distrust in governance. While it might solidify Mnangagwas control in the short term, it risks long-term instability, economic decline, and the further marginalization of Zimbabwe on the global stage.Several foreign actors may have vested interests in Emmerson Mnangagwa securing a third term in office. These interests are shaped by geopolitical considerations, economic partnerships, and regional dynamics:1. ChinaEconomic Interests:China has significant investments in Zimbabwe, particularly in mining, infrastructure, and agriculture. Mnangagwas continued leadership ensures policy continuity and a favorable environment for Chinese enterprises.Zimbabwes rich natural resources, such as platinum and lithium, are critical to Chinas strategic economic goals, including its global supply chains.Strategic Partnership:Beijing values Mnangagwas support for its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and his governments alignment with Chinas development model, which prioritizes state-led growth over Western-style liberal democracy.2. RussiaMilitary and Resource Ties:Russia has developed close ties with Zimbabwe in areas like military cooperation and resource extraction, including mining. Mnangagwas leadership provides Moscow with a stable partner to expand its influence in Southern Africa.Political Alignment:Zimbabwes alignment with Russia on key international issues, including support for Russia in the United Nations, makes Mnangagwas continued rule advantageous for Moscow.3. South AfricaRegional Stability:As Zimbabwes neighbor and largest trading partner, South Africa has a vested interest in stability. Mnangagwas leadership, while controversial, might be viewed as less destabilizing compared to a potential leadership vacuum or a contested transition.Migration Concerns:South Africa already faces challenges from Zimbabwean migrants fleeing economic hardships. A power struggle or instability could exacerbate migration pressures, something Pretoria seeks to avoid.4. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Resource Access:The UAE has shown interest in Zimbabwes gold and other natural resources. Mnangagwas government has facilitated agreements that allow UAE companies to operate in Zimbabwe, creating a mutually beneficial relationship.Political Influence:The UAE may prefer a leader like Mnangagwa who can maintain centralized control, ensuring predictability for its business ventures.5. African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC)Avoiding Precedents of Instability:Both the AU and SADC prioritize stability and may support Mnangagwa as a means of avoiding potential conflict or political turmoil in Zimbabwe, which could destabilize the region.6. Emerging Actors: India and TurkeyExpanding Influence:Both India and Turkey are seeking to deepen their presence in Africa. Mnangagwas continued leadership offers an opportunity to build on existing relationships and expand their economic and diplomatic footprints in Zimbabwe.Key Motivations of Foreign ActorsEconomic Gain: Access to Zimbabwes abundant natural resources, including gold, platinum, and lithium.Geopolitical Leverage: Strengthening alliances in Africa to counter Western influence.Stability Over Democracy: Prioritizing stable, predictable governance over democratic reforms to protect investments and regional interests.ConclusionWhile Western democracies may view a third term for Mnangagwa as a setback for democracy, actors like China, Russia, and the UAE likely see it as an opportunity to maintain favorable relations and secure their economic and strategic interests in Zimbabwe. Regional players like South Africa may prioritize stability, even if it comes at the expense of democratic principles.Securing a third term for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Zimbabwe would likely require strategic political maneuvering, constitutional changes, and suppression of opposition. Below are potential scenarios through which Mnangagwa might secure a third term:1. Constitutional AmendmentLegal Changes:The ruling ZANU-PF party could push for an amendment to the constitution to remove or extend the presidential term limits.With ZANU-PFs parliamentary majority, they could achieve the two-thirds vote required to pass such an amendment.Referendum Option:Alternatively, the government could call for a national referendum, presenting the amendment as necessary for stability or continuity.Challenges:Resistance from opposition parties and civil society.Risk of backlash from the international community, which may impose sanctions or withdraw support.2. Judicial InterventionCourt Ruling on Term Limits:Mnangagwa could leverage the judiciary to interpret term limits in a way that allows him to run again, possibly arguing that his first term under the new constitution (post-2018) doesnt count toward the limit.Influence Over Judiciary:Zimbabwes judiciary has faced accusations of partisanship, and Mnangagwas administration could use this to its advantage.Challenges:Loss of public trust in judicial independence.Potential for civil unrest if the public perceives the ruling as illegitimate.3. ZANU-PF Internal ConsolidationParty Endorsement:Mnangagwa could secure ZANU-PFs internal support by rallying key factions, sidelining rivals, and promising benefits to influential party members.Crushing Dissent:Any internal opposition, such as factions loyal to Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, could be suppressed through political or legal means.Challenges:Risk of factional splits within ZANU-PF.Weakened internal unity could lead to instability.4.

Mnangagwas government has facilitated agreements that allow UAE companies to operate in Zimbabwe, creating a mutually beneficial relationship.Political Influence:The UAE may prefer a leader like Mnangagwa who can maintain centralized control, ensuring predictability for its business ventures.5. African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC)Avoiding Precedents of Instability:Both the AU and SADC prioritize stability and may support Mnangagwa as a means of avoiding potential conflict or political turmoil in Zimbabwe, which could destabilize the region.6. Emerging Actors: India and TurkeyExpanding Influence:Both India and Turkey are seeking to deepen their presence in Africa. Mnangagwas continued leadership offers an opportunity to build on existing relationships and expand their economic and diplomatic footprints in Zimbabwe.Key Motivations of Foreign ActorsEconomic Gain: Access to Zimbabwes abundant natural resources, including gold, platinum, and lithium.Geopolitical Leverage: Strengthening alliances in Africa to counter Western influence.Stability Over Democracy: Prioritizing stable, predictable governance over democratic reforms to protect investments and regional interests.ConclusionWhile Western democracies may view a third term for Mnangagwa as a setback for democracy, actors like China, Russia, and the UAE likely see it as an opportunity to maintain favorable relations and secure their economic and strategic interests in Zimbabwe. Regional players like South Africa may prioritize stability, even if it comes at the expense of democratic principles.Securing a third term for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Zimbabwe would likely require strategic political maneuvering, constitutional changes, and suppression of opposition. Below are potential scenarios through which Mnangagwa might secure a third term:1. Constitutional AmendmentLegal Changes:The ruling ZANU-PF party could push for an amendment to the constitution to remove or extend the presidential term limits.With ZANU-PFs parliamentary majority, they could achieve the two-thirds vote required to pass such an amendment.Referendum Option:Alternatively, the government could call for a national referendum, presenting the amendment as necessary for stability or continuity.Challenges:Resistance from opposition parties and civil society.Risk of backlash from the international community, which may impose sanctions or withdraw support.2. Judicial InterventionCourt Ruling on Term Limits:Mnangagwa could leverage the judiciary to interpret term limits in a way that allows him to run again, possibly arguing that his first term under the new constitution (post-2018) doesnt count toward the limit.Influence Over Judiciary:Zimbabwes judiciary has faced accusations of partisanship, and Mnangagwas administration could use this to its advantage.Challenges:Loss of public trust in judicial independence.Potential for civil unrest if the public perceives the ruling as illegitimate.3. ZANU-PF Internal ConsolidationParty Endorsement:Mnangagwa could secure ZANU-PFs internal support by rallying key factions, sidelining rivals, and promising benefits to influential party members.Crushing Dissent:Any internal opposition, such as factions loyal to Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, could be suppressed through political or legal means.Challenges:Risk of factional splits within ZANU-PF.Weakened internal unity could lead to instability.4. Manipulation of Electoral ProcessesElection Engineering:The regime could manipulate the electoral process, ensuring Mnangagwas victory regardless of constitutional constraints.Tactics could include voter intimidation, suppression of opposition campaigns, and control over electoral commissions.Post-Election Legitimization:Following the election, ZANU-PF could argue that the will of the people supersedes constitutional term limits.Challenges:Loss of credibility in the electoral system.Risk of mass protests or violent backlash from opposition supporters.5. National Emergency or Crisis JustificationState of Emergency:Mnangagwa could declare a national emergency, citing economic challenges, political unrest, or foreign interference, to justify extending his term without elections.Delaying Elections:Using a crisis as a pretext, elections could be postponed indefinitely, allowing Mnangagwa to remain in power.Challenges:Requires significant control over security forces and public perception.Could lead to international condemnation and domestic unrest.6. International Support or Neutralization of OppositionForeign Backing:Leveraging relationships with key international allies like China, Russia, or South Africa to legitimize his continued rule.Co-Opting Opposition:Weakening or dividing the opposition through financial inducements, arrests, or propaganda campaigns.Challenges:Maintaining foreign support while avoiding alienation from Western powers and international organizations.7. Popular Campaign for ContinuityPublic Relations Effort:Launching a campaign to portray Mnangagwa as the indispensable leader who can maintain stability and economic progress.Mobilizing grassroots support through Zanu PF structures and allied organizations.\n\n2. Russia\n\nMilitary and Resource Ties:\n\nRussia has developed close ties with Zimbabwe in areas like military cooperation and resource extraction, including mining.

South AfricaRegional Stability:As Zimbabwes neighbor and largest trading partner, South Africa has a vested interest in stability. Mnangagwas leadership, while controversial, might be viewed as less destabilizing compared to a potential leadership vacuum or a contested transition.Migration Concerns:South Africa already faces challenges from Zimbabwean migrants fleeing economic hardships.
