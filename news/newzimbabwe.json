            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has dismissed an application by Harare lawyer Emmanuel Mukwewa to rescind a default judgment ordering him and businessman Richard Paswa to jointly repay US$176,000 to Chinese investor Huang Li Qiang over a botched land deal.\n\nJustice Siyabona Musithu ruled that Mukwewa failed to show good and sufficient cause for setting aside the judgment, finding that his explanation for ignoring summons and his alleged defence were both without merit.The applicant failed to give a reasonable explanation for his failure to enter an appearance to defend, the judge said.The purported defence on the merits bears no prospects of success.The dispute arose in September 2023 when Huang entered into what was called an Agreement of Consultancy of Immovable Property drafted by Mukwewa. Under the deal, Paswa was to sell Huang a 20,000 square metre stand in Harares Coca Cola area. Huang paid US$170,000 of the purchase price, but the land was never delivered.In July 2024, after neither Paswa nor Mukwewa filed a defence to Huangs lawsuit, the court granted a default judgment, ordering the pair to refund Huang with interest and costs. The investor had accused Mukwewa of colluding with Paswa to defraud him, alleging the stand was non-existent.Mukwewa argued he only learned of the judgment months later and claimed he was not properly served since the summons was left at his old office gate after he had moved. He further insisted he acted only as a legal practitioner drafting the agreement, not as a party to the transaction.But Musithu rejected this, saying service by affixing was proper under the rules and that Mukwewas conduct in drafting and facilitating the deal went beyond mere legal drafting.The way the applicant handled the transaction, as well as the movement of the funds, was all shrouded in secrecy. It bears all the hallmarks of a fraudulent transaction, and regrettably, with the applicant as the main facilitator, the court ruled.The judge noted that Mukwewa styled the contract as a consultancy deal, yet it clearly amounted to a sale of immovable property which never existed.It gave the impression that the property was in existence at the time the applicant prepared the agreement of sale. Yet, as it turns out, the property did not exist,Musithu said.He added that Mukwewas failure to protect his clients interests, including releasing funds without ensuring title transfer, was professionally negligent at best and fraudulent at worst.The apparent lack of care exhibited by the applicant makes him susceptible to a claim of this nature, the judge concluded.Mukwewas application was dismissed with costs, leaving the default judgment against him and Paswa intact.\n\nJustice Siyabona Musithu ruled that Mukwewa failed to show good and sufficient cause for setting aside the judgment, finding that his explanation for ignoring summons and his alleged defence were both without merit.\n\nThe applicant failed to give a reasonable explanation for his failure to enter an appearance to defend, the judge said.The purported defence on the merits bears no prospects of success.The dispute arose in September 2023 when Huang entered into what was called an Agreement of Consultancy of Immovable Property drafted by Mukwewa.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has dismissed a bid by former Zimbabwean diplomat Robert Mabulala to overturn the seizure of his Isuzu KB 280 truck by the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA), ruling that the tax authority acted lawfully in ordering the vehicles re-export to South Africa.\n\nJustice Siyabona Musithu, handing down judgment said Mabulalas challenge was devoid of merit and that ZIMRAs officials simply enforced the law.The respondent would not have been expected to act on the basis of a licence that had been issued in violation of the law, the judge said, adding: Section 3(1) of Statutory Instrument 54/24 is very clear that a vehicle which is imported in violation of that provision has to be re-exported at the importers expense.Mabulala served as a counsellor at Zimbabwes embassy in Pretoria between 2016 and June 2024. When his tour ended, he returned home with two vehicles: a Land Rover Defender and a second-hand Isuzu KB 280 manufactured in 2001.ZIMRA cleared the Defender under the immigrants rebate facility but refused to release the Isuzu, citing Statutory Instrument 54 of 2024, which bans the importation of second-hand vehicles older than ten years. Officials ordered the vehicle re-exported at Mabulalas cost.Mabulala argued that as a returning diplomat, he qualified for exemptions under SI 111 of 2024, which allows diplomats and returning residents to import older vehicles. He further pointed to an import licence issued to him in July 2024 as proof that his Isuzu qualified for clearance.But ZIMRA countered that the law only allows one motor vehicle per returning resident under the rebate scheme. The Defender had already been processed under that facility, meaning the Isuzu did not qualify. The authority also argued that Mabulalas import licence was nugatory because it was issued four months after SI 54/24 had outlawed such licences.Musithu agreed with ZIMRA, stressing that exemptions under SI 111/24 still fall under the one-vehicle limit.The explanatory note made it clear that the exemption applied to used vehicles imported by diplomats granted immigration rebates by ZIMRA the applicant could not claim a rebate of duty in respect of the Isuzu once he had claimed that same rebate in respect of the Defender, the judge said.He also dismissed Mabulalas reliance on the temporary report order that allowed him to move the car inland for clearance, saying it is merely a form of deferred clearance and not a guarantee of approval.Finding no basis to set aside ZIMRAs decision, the court ordered Mabulala to bear the authoritys legal costs.The decision cannot be characterised as grossly unreasonable or irrational, Justice Musithu ruled. Hardships flowing from the applicants violation of the law cannot be blamed on ZIMRA.\n\nJustice Siyabona Musithu, handing down judgment said Mabulalas challenge was devoid of merit and that ZIMRAs officials simply enforced the law.\n\nThe respondent would not have been expected to act on the basis of a licence that had been issued in violation of the law, the judge said, adding: Section 3(1) of Statutory Instrument 54/24 is very clear that a vehicle which is imported in violation of that provision has to be re-exported at the importers expense.Mabulala served as a counsellor at Zimbabwes embassy in Pretoria between 2016 and June 2024.
