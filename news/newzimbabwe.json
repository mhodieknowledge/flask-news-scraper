            "content": "By Tawanda Karombo | Christian Science Monitor\n\nIt was 10 p.m. when a frantic pounding on Modester Nyangonis door dragged her out of a deep sleep.\n\nThat hot October day, she had been on her feet manning her stall at the largest market in Zimbabwes capital, a bustling maze of businesses selling everything from dried fish and gas stove accessories to hair extensions.\n\nNow, a neighbor was at her door to tell her that the market where she worked, Mbare Musika, was on fire.\n\nBy the time Ms. Nyangoni reached her stall, nothing was left. The flames had torn through everything in their path, including the cash savings many traders hid with their wares in order to keep them out of Zimbabwes topsy-turvy banking system.\n\nWithin hours, around $5 million in goods, cash, and property went up in smoke, according to official estimates. Nothing was insured.\n\nThe fires devastation is part of a wider crisis: Most Zimbabweans live on the precipice of economic disaster. Over the past two decades, relentless financial crises havedoubledthe number of people here living in extreme poverty  a figure that stands today at about40%. Three-quarters of Zimbabweans toil in the informal workforce, one of the highest rates of off-the-books work in the world. This year, the government introduced a new currency, called the Zimbabwe Gold, or ZiG, to help stabilize the economy. Instead, it has plummeted ordinary Zimbabweans into further uncertainty.\n\nFor traders at Mbare Musika, the fire was simply the last domino to fall.\n\nModester Nyangoni sits at her makeshift stall at Mbare Musika market in Harare, Zimbabwe, which was badly damaged in a fire.\n\nThis was not the first time that many of the traders in Mbare Musika lost their savings in an instant.\n\nIn the early 2000s, a catastrophic agricultural reform program and an expensive war in Congo left Zimbabwes government flat broke. To fill its coffers, it decided to simply print more money, and then more again. By mid-2008, inflation hit 231,000,000%.\n\nMs. Nyangoni remembers her late mother, also a trader, coming home at the end of her workday with big plastic bags full of nearly worthless cash. If they were lucky, the family might be able to exchange the money for a single loaf of bread. The price tag:nearly 100 billionZimbabwean dollars (about $5).\n\nFinally, in 2009, the government stopped printing Zimbabwean dollars, and officially allowed the use of the U.S. dollar and the South African rand. But by then, most Zimbabweans had lost any savings they had.\n\nMeanwhile, multinationals like mining and tobacco companies fled en masse, and even many large local businesses found themselves unable to bear the financial risk of keeping their doors open.\n\nMany simply could not survive the uncertainty, explains Batanai Matsika, a researcher and finance professional in Harare. That, in turn, led to a proliferation of informal players.\n\nWhat he means is that over the next decade, the economy became, increasingly, an unregulated Wild West. People still farmed, mined, and traded  but now they did it all out of the governments reach. Businesses went unregistered, taxes unpaid. Zimbabweans learned to keep their cash close, and bought and sold things in whatever combination of rand and U.S. dollars they happened to have on hand. By 2022, just 30% of adults in Zimbabwe wereregularly usinga bank account.\n\nWe no longer trust keeping money at the banks, explains Irene Mutanga, another trader at Mbare Musika. We are wiser now.\n\nToday, Zimbabwe has one of the worlds largest informal economies, according tothe World Bank, with nearlytwo-thirdsof its gross domestic product generated completely off the books.\n\nMeanwhile, onseveral occasionsover the past decade, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has tried to introduce new local currencies to stabilize the economy. But each time, Zimbabweans skepticism has tanked their value.\n\nLike most Zimbabweans, Ms. Mutanga operates in multiple parallel financial universes every day. At her market stall, she accepts payment for baggies of dried fish in both U.S. dollars and ZiG. Like other traders, she pegs her ZiG prices to the black market exchange rate, which is about twice the official one.\n\nShe then uses her ZiG  now pegged to the official exchange rate  to pay government bills or buy groceries at big-box supermarkets.\n\nMore than a month after the fire at Mbare Musika, Ms. Mutanga says she is still struggling to rebuild what she lost. The market has sprung up again, quite literally from the ashes. But its paved floors are gone, replaced by thick dust that turns to a muddy slurry on rainy days.\n\nOn a recent morning, she rearranged the bags of fish on her table and thought of the bill she owed for her childrens school fees  ZiG 3750, or $150. She was late. The headmaster had given her a month.\n\nAnd so she waited anxiously for her next customer. It was nearing 3 p.m., and so far today, she had sold nothing.\n\n",

When they voice their concerns, they often face derogatory labels that suppress their voices.\n\nOur word of encouragement is that they should not be deterred. They should defend their rights as difficult as it might.\n\nWe are happy that we now have women who now hold titles previously reserved for men, she noted.\n\nIYWD is a young feminist organisation dedicated to amplifying the voices and experiences of young women in marginalized communities.\n\nThe organisation is committed to mobilising and empowering young women by enhancing their capacity to participate and contribute to holistic and gender-responsive community development.\n\nSince its inception in 2009, IYWD has successfully engaged with marginalised young women and girls, who have grown aware of their roles in community development and local governance, advocating for gender-responsive social service delivery in alignment with constitutional mandates for citizen engagement in local governance.\n\nWe do this work through engaging authentically with the Government of Zimbabwe, independent commissions, corporations, traditional chiefs, religious leaders, family, and with each other.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nHigh Court judges Justices Esther Muremba and Deputy Judge President Garainesu Mawadze have urged the legislature to broaden the sentencing jurisdiction of regional magistrates so they can impose sentences that more accurately reflect the severity of the offences they adjudicate.\n\nCurrently, magistrates sentencing powers are limited to just 12 years, despite their handling of serious and complex criminal cases.\n\nUnder the new sentencing guidelines, robbery offences committed under aggravating circumstances carry a presumptive penalty of 20 years imprisonment.\n\nThis is significantly higher than the 12-year cap imposed on regional magistrates for such offences, as outlined in section 51(2)(b)(ii) of the Magistrates Court Act [Chapter 7:10].\n\nWhen the presumptive penalty surpasses the limits of magistrate jurisdiction, cases must be referred to higher courts that can impose appropriate sentences.\n\nThis call to action from the judges was prompted by the case of armed robbers Israel Mufure (22) and Charles Murinda (55), who terrorised a school in Norton by robbing five teachers in a dramatic style using a pellet gun to intimidate their victims.\n\nBoth individuals faced charges and were convicted of five counts of robbery and one count of unlawful entry into premises. They each received a 10-year prison sentence for the first five robbery counts, which were consolidated for sentencing purposes, and another 10 years for the sixth count.\n\nJustice Muremba expressed concern that the sentence was excessively lenient, given the nature of the offence.\n\nI have reservations regarding the sentence for the first to fifth counts, which I find to be unduly lenient considering the aggravating circumstances under which the robberies were committed, said Muremba.\n\nShe went on to explain how she had queried the regional magistrate about the 10-year sentence for multiple counts of robbery committed under aggravating circumstances.\n\nWhen I queried the learned regional magistrate about the 10-year sentence for five counts of robbery committed under aggravating circumstances, given the presumptive penalty of 20 years imprisonment for one count, she replied that her jurisdiction in robbery cases is limited to 12 years under section 51(3) of the Magistrates Court Act [Chapter 7:10], Muremba noted.\n\nMuremba indicated that the magistrate did not elaborate on her reasoning or clarify why she considered 12 years to be the normal range for a sentence in light of the higher presumptive penalty detailed in the guidelines.\n\nThe regional magistrate handling this matter should have been aware of this when sentencing the accused.\n\nShe should have acknowledged in her sentencing judgment that the presumptive penalty exceeded her jurisdictional limits and explained her approach to sentencing the accused in light of this discrepancy.\n\nMurembasaidthe belief that the maximum sentencing jurisdiction reflects the normal sentencing range raises significant concerns.\n\nWhile adhering to jurisdictional limits is necessary, this view may indicate a disconnect from the sentencing guidelines, which suggest a presumptive penalty of 20 years. It appears the learned regional magistrate has not fully embraced or given due weight to the new sentencing framework, the judgesaid.\n\nShe pointed out that regional magistrates predominantly handle robbery cases with aggravating circumstances.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial that their sentencing jurisdiction be expanded to ensure that they can adequately and efficiently impose sentences that reflect the severity of these offences.\n\nMuremba highlighted that current alternatives to extending magistrates sentencing jurisdiction are often cumbersome, unclear, and may lack rationality depending on the circumstances.\n\nBy increasing the sentencing powers of magistrates, we can streamline the judicial process, reduce delays, and ensure that justice is served in a timely and fair manner, she stated.\n\nBoth Muremba and Mawadze asserted that this modification would foster consistency and uniformity in sentencing, ultimately bolstering public trust in the judicial system.\n\nI urge the legislature to consider this judgment and prioritise the necessary amendments to the Magistrates Court Act.\n\nAligning magistrates sentencing jurisdictions with the presumptive penalties will not only facilitate more effective sentencing but will also uphold the principles of justice and equity in our legal system.\n\nMuremba concluded that Referring such cases for sentencing to the High Court is a cumbersome process that delays the finalisation of these matters.\n\nThe court learned that Mufure and Murinda targeted five teachers at a primary school in the Norton farming area.\n\nThe two men had knocked on doors, forced the teachers to comply using a pellet gun, and stripped them of their belongings.\n\nSome victims were confined in their rooms during the ordeal.\n\nFollowing the robbery, they broke into the headmasters office and stole property valued at US$1,800.00, of which US$1,000.00 was recovered upon their arrest.\n\nAfter committing the crimes in Norton, the defendants hired a vehicle and travelled to Gokwe with the stolen items, where the recovered property was eventually located.\n\n",

That constitution is flawed and it can be challenged left, right and centre.\n\nThe whole process of the constitution to get to that point can be challenged too. There are many things and so the ace card is yet to be played, he said.\n\nHe further accused the Ethics Committee of being corrupt adding that the Sports Recreation Commission (SRC) had made it clear that Magwizi will be ZIFA president.\n\nThere is a lot of money which has been spent, money which has been thrown around.\n\nAn Ethics Committee which is supposed to be ethical has become corrupt. I would not want to say much, but the Sports Recreation Commission (SRC) was very clear that it wanted Magwizi. I have inside information pertaining to that.\n\nHe was their blue-eyed boy, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) shadow Minister of Energy and Power DevelopmentLeslie Mhangwahas criticizedthe government for the current power outages,saying they areman-made, a result of poor planning.\n\nHis comments fly in the face of authorities who claim the outages were triggered by the El Nino-induced drought which has seen water levels at the hydroelectric-powered Kariba Dam depleting, forcing the nation to resort to load shedding.\n\nBut speaking to Open Parly recently, the Chinhoyi MP slammed authorities for the incessant power cuts arguing the country is not producing enough energy.\n\nI quizzed the Energy Minister for an explanation over the gap of what is being produced and demanded in our peak region which is about 300 to 400 MW and that should not translate to the prolonged load shedding that we are having.\n\nOrdinarily we have the peak in the mornings and evenings so if your production is constant it means that when the demand gets lower, the gap is narrowed, he said.\n\nLeslie Mhangwa\n\nIn response, the minister referred to the fact that loads that are exempted from load shedding are those that have dedicated feeds in the form of hospitals, critical loads which take a chunk out of what is being produced.\n\nAdded Mhangwa, Our electricity situation, sadly so is much dire, unfortunately from the other side of the government, they described it as subdued.\n\nWhat is needed by the industry and what is needed by the consumers at home we are getting far less than we need. This is not something you can attribute to a Natural Disaster or whats the impression they want to give is that predominantly its because of Kariba.\n\nThis is man-made. This is because of lagging in our planning and implementation of our energy projects.\n\nHowever, some sections of the society have dismissed the Shadow Ministers observations, describing them as cheap politicking contradicting the realities on the ground.\n\nFor instance, Zambia which shares the Kariba Dam has been experiencing acute power outages with consumers enjoying electricity for just three hours a day in a development which begs the question as to whether Zambians have also been bad energy planners.\n\n",
