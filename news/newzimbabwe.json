            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nPRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa has extended the term of office of General Philip Valerio Sibanda as Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) by a year.\n\nThe latest development, viewed as a power consolidation strategy as Mnangagwa reportedly seeks a third presidential term, comes as Sibanda reached the retirement age of 70.\n\nMnangagwa, himself aged 82 and currently on leave, used powers vested in him as the Commander-ln-Chief of ZDF, while guided by provisions the Defence (Regular Force) (Officers) Regulations, 1988, published in Statutory Instrument 152 of 1988, to stretch Sibandas reign as Commander of the ZDF by one year.\n\nThe ZDF incorporates the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) and Airforce of Zimbabwe (AFZ).\n\nIn a notice published in the Government Gazette, the Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet, Martin Rushwaya, said Sibandas term took effect from December 24, 2024, and will last until November 23, 2025.\n\nExtension of Term of the Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces. It is hereby notified that His Excellency the President has, in terms of proviso (i) to the Defence (Regular Force) (Officers) Regulations, 1988, published in Statutory Instrument 152 of 1988, extended the appointment of General Philip Valerio Sibanda as Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces with effect from the 24th December 2024 to the 23rd November 2025, said Rushwaya.\n\nSibanda has served as the Commander of the ZDF since 2017, succeeding the current Vice President, Constantino Chiwenga, who previously held the position.\n\nMnangagwas decision to keep Sibanda in charge of the army follows his recent replacement of the heads of the dreaded Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) and Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) last week, marking a wholesome reconfiguration of the countrys security sector. Fulton Mangwanya replaced Isaac Moyo as CIO boss while Stephen Mutamba took over from Godwin Matanga as Commissioner-General of Police.\n\nMnangagwa, recently promoted six Colonels in the ZNA to the rank of Brigadier-Generals effective December 16, 2024.\n\nHe made the promotions in terms of the Defence Act (Chapter 11:02) Section 20, as read with Statutory Instrument 257 of 2020.\n\nThe six newly-promoted six Brigadier-Generals are Oscar Tshuma, Raban Nikisi, Benjamin Sabata, Passmore Taruodzera, Million Ndlovu, and Lawrence Munzararikwa.\n\n",

            "content": "By Tapiwa Svondo\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) has applauded the Government of Zimbabwe for its landmark decision to abolish the death penalty.\n\nThe quasi-governmental body says the move will promote human rights and the sanctity of life in the country.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa recently signed into law the Death Penalty Abolition Act, which saw over 60 prisoners awaiting the hangmans noose having their sentences commuted to life imprisonment.\n\nThe last execution in the country was nearly two decades ago in 2005.\n\nIn a statement, the ZHRC noted that the governments legislative development aligns Zimbabwe with global trends, which will eliminate the punishment and uphold modern human rights standards.\n\nThe new Act eliminates the death penalty in Zimbabwe, ensuring no person shall be sentenced to death or executed.\n\nThis legislative development aligns with modern human rights standards and reflects the global trend towards the abolition of the death penalty.\n\nZimbabwe now joins a growing number of nations that have recognised the inherent dignity of every human being, regardless of their past actions.\n\nThis development also reinforces Zimbabwes alignment with international human rights instruments such as the African Charter on Human and Peoples Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, said the commission.\n\nZHRC also commended the government for its efforts of re-sentencing offenders while also providing legal representation and opportunities for clemency for those affected.\n\nThe ZHRC applauds the inclusive and compassionate approach taken in the transitional provisions of the Act, ensuring prisoners under sentence of death are afforded legal representation and the opportunity for clemency. This approach underlines the importance of rehabilitation over retribution in Zimbabwes justice system.\n\nThe ZHRC highly commends the unity of purpose demonstrated by the political leadership across the political divide, notably, Honourable Edwin Mushoriwa who introduced the Private Members Bill in November 2023, Honourable Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi who facilitated the passage, Members of Parliament as a whole, and His Excellency Dr. E. D. Mnangagwa who signed the Bill into law, ZHRC said.\n\nGovernment was further called on to ratify outstanding international treaties such as the UN Convention Against Torture.\n\nThis milestone achievement symbolises Zimbabwes commitment to upholding constitutional, regional and international human rights standards. In that vein the ZHRC therefore urges the Government of Zimbabwe to maintain the momentum and ratify outstanding treaties, particularly the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), and the UN Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (CED), ZHRC said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE standard precautionary pest control measure to destroy tobacco seedbeds for the 2024/25 cropping season has been moved to January 15, 2025.\n\nBefore the latest development, it was expected that farmers would have put out seedbeds by New Years Eve.\n\nIn a recent statement, the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (TIMB), which regulates the golden leaf industry, said the extension was done under the Plant Pests and Diseases (Tobacco) Regulations, 1979, which mandated that all tobacco seedbeds be destroyed by December 31 to break the life cycle of pests and diseases that can affect tobacco plants.\n\nThe slow start to the rain season has seen most farmers delaying transplanting the crops, hence extension of the grace period by which seedbeds should have been removed.\n\nHowever, due to a prolonged dry spell and delayed rains, farmers relying on rain-fed dryland tobacco could not transplant in time due to insufficient water resources.\n\nThe Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Water, Fisheries, and Rural Development Dr Anxious Masuka, has extended the deadline for destroying tobacco seedbeds to 15 January 2025, said TIMB.\n\nTIMB said the decision ensured farmers could preserve their investments and reap the benefits of their months of hard work.\n\nTobacco is Zimbabwes second largest foreign currency earner after gold and is primarily cultivated by smallholder farmers, who were allocated land under the land reform programme Zimbabwe embarked on in 2000.\n\nDespite the adverse impact of the El-Nino-induced drought experienced last year due to a poor rainfall pattern in the 2023/24 summer cropping season, the country recorded 236 million kilogrammes of the golden leaf.\n\nTobacco production involves sowing seeds and maintaining a seedbed for three months, land preparation and preparing ridges onto which they will transplant the seedlings.\n\nTherefore, destroying all tobacco plants in seedbeds means farmers cannot transplant anymore.\n\nThe December rains brought relief and optimism for dryland tobacco growers, marking a turning point for the 2024/25 season, said TIMB.\n\nAs of December 27, 2024, growers had transplanted 84 661 hectares, surpassing the 82 392ha recorded during the same period in 2023.\n\nAdditionally, a total of 126 092 growers have been registered, compared to 112 904 growers in 2023.\n\nThese figures highlight the industrys resilience and growth, with a national target of 300 million kilograms of tobacco set for the season.\n\nTo ensure success, the focus for this season remains on adopting climate-smart agriculture practices that build resilience against erratic weather patterns.\n\nTobacco growers are encouraged to control weeds to reduce competition for water, use potholes to capture rainfall and prevent runoff, and maintain proper ridges for efficient drainage.\n\n",
