I received a document dated the 22ndof February 2025 in which a medical practitioner attended to the second accused person.\n\nThe document indicates that the accused is expected to recuperate within seven days so my application is that the matter be postponed to Monday next week, on the 3rdof March for commencement of trial, Mugiya submitted.\n\nThe court heard the letter was written by Dr D Ngwaru.\n\nMugiya also requested a court order directing that Chimombe be examined by a state doctor.\n\nI so pray that this directive will be issued by the court, he said.\n\nWitness Mabhaudhi representing the state said he was not opposed to the postponement but shot down the request to have a courtorderissued as requested by Mugiya.\n\nIts unlike a mental health issue. No one is challenging that medical report.\n\nWe expect him (Chimombe) to be here on Monday so there is no need for him to be examined by a doctor. The matter has been remanded so that should suffice, he said.\n\nThe presiding judge Kwenda granted a postponement of the trial to Monday but agreed with the state and said he would not issue a court order for Chimombe to be seen by state doctors.\n\nChimombe is jointly charged with his colleague Moses Mpofu.\n\nThe two have been in custody since their arrest in June last year with all their attempts to secure freedom having failed.\n\nThere have been many false starts to the duos trial from the time they were indicted last year.\n\nThe two made a lengthy application for referral of their case to the Constitution Court without luck.\n\nTheir trial has also been postponed on several occasions for various reasons.\n\n",

            "title": "How Mobile Gaming is Transforming Entertainment and Connectivity in Zimbabwe",
            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/how-mobile-gaming-is-transforming-entertainment-and-connectivity-in-zimbabwe/",
            "content": "Mobile gaming has seen explosive growth in Zimbabwe over the last decade, with online casino games such as roulette and slots becoming increasingly popular. What was once a niche industry is now a mainstream form of entertainment, attracting thousands of players from different backgrounds. The rapid adoption of smartphones, improvements in internet infrastructure, and growing interest in digital entertainment have contributed to this transformation. Today, many Zimbabweans can access online casino games from the palm of their hands, enjoying an experience that was once limited to physical casinos.\n\nSmartphones: Bringing Casino Games to the Masses\n\nOne of the primary reasons for the growth of mobile gaming in Zimbabwe is the increasing availability of affordable smartphones. A decade ago, high-end mobile devices were a luxury, accessible only to the wealthy. However, brands like Tecno, Itel, and Infinix have flooded the market with budget-friendly smartphones, making mobile gaming accessible to a much broader audience. With even entry-level smartphones now capable of running online casino games smoothly, more Zimbabweans are taking advantage of the convenience and entertainment these platforms provide.\n\nThis accessibility has led to a shift in gaming habits. Instead of visiting brick-and-mortar casinos, players now have the freedom to enjoy andplay online rouletteor spin the reels on a slot machine from anywherewhether they are at home, commuting, or even on a lunch break. The ease of access has played a significant role in driving interest in online casino gaming.\n\nFaster Internet and Improved Infrastructure\n\nAnother critical factor fuelling the growth of mobile gaming in Zimbabwe is the improvement in internet connectivity. Just a few years ago, slow speeds and expensive data plans made online gaming difficult. However, telecom providers such asEconet, NetOne, and Telecel have expanded their mobile broadband networks, bringing 3G and 4G connectivity to more areas. As a result, playing online casino games has become a seamless experience, with minimal buffering or connectivity issues.\n\nThe increasing competition among internet providers has also led to more affordable data packages. Daily, weekly, and monthly gaming bundles allow players to enjoy their favourite casino games without worrying about excessive data costs. This has made mobile gaming far more appealing, especially to younger audiences who are already accustomed to spending time on their phones.\n\nAdditionally, as Zimbabwe moves towards adopting 5G technology, the future of mobile gaming looks even brighter. Faster speeds and lower latency will improve the overall gaming experience, making it even easier for players to engage in real-time casino games like live dealer roulette or poker.\n\nThe Appeal of Online Casino Games: Why Players Love Slots and Roulette\n\nWhile mobile gaming spans multiple genres, casino games like roulette and slots have gained particular traction in Zimbabwe. These games offer quick entertainment, the potential for big winnings, and a level of excitement that keeps players engaged.\n\nSlot games are especially popular due to their simplicity. Unlike poker or blackjack, which require strategy and decision-making, slot games are easy to playjust spin the reels and hope for a winning combination. The introduction of themed slot games with vibrant graphics and sound effects has further enhanced their appeal, making them an attractive option for casual gamers.\n\nRoulette, on the other hand, appeals to those who enjoy a more dynamic betting experience. The thrill of watching the wheel spin and anticipating where the ball will land keeps players coming back for more. Online platforms now offer both classic European and American roulette variations, as well as modern digital adaptations that introduce new features and betting options.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the popularity of these games is the presence of progressive jackpots. Many online slots now offer huge pooled jackpots that can be won by any player, adding an extra layer of excitement. For Zimbabweans looking for entertainment combined with the chance to win life-changing amounts of money, these games are an irresistible option.\n\nThe Rise of Mobile Payments and Accessibility\n\nThe integration of mobile payment solutions has also played a major role in the expansion of mobile gaming in Zimbabwe. Unlike in many Western countries where credit and debit cards are the dominant payment methods, Zimbabweans rely heavily on mobile money platforms such as EcoCash, OneMoney, and Telecash for financial transactions.\n\nOnline casino operators have quickly adapted to this trend, making it easy for players to deposit and withdraw money using mobile wallets. This convenience has eliminated the traditional barriers to entry, allowing more players to participate in mobile gambling without the need for a bank account or credit card.\n\nCryptocurrency is also gaining traction within the online gaming industry. Some international betting sites that accept Zimbabwean players now support Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, offering an alternative for those who prefer secure and anonymous transactions.\n\nSocial and Economic Impact of Mobile Casino Gaming\n\nThe rapid growth of mobile gaming in Zimbabwe has not only provided entertainment but also opened up new economic opportunities. Local entrepreneurs are developing gaming apps and platforms, creating employment for developers, designers, and marketing professionals. As mobile gaming continues to grow, more job opportunities are expected to emerge within the industry.\n\nAdditionally, online casinos have introduced new revenue streams for players. While most people play casino games for fun, others see it as a way to supplement their income. Some players participate in online tournaments and high-stakes games, hoping to turn their skills into profit. Although gambling comes with risks, the potential rewards have encouraged many Zimbabweans to try their luck.\n\nHowever, the industry has also raised concerns about responsible gaming. The accessibility of online casino games means that players can engage in gambling at any time, which can lead to addiction if not managed properly. To address this issue, many online gaming platforms have introduced responsible gambling features, such as deposit limits and self-exclusion options. Awareness campaigns about the risks of gambling are also becoming more common, helping players make informed decisions about their gaming habits.\n\nLooking ahead, the mobile gaming industry in Zimbabwe is poised for continued growth. As smartphone technology improves and internet infrastructure expands, even more players will join the digital gaming revolution. The governments stance on online gaming regulations will also play a crucial role in shaping the industry. If properly regulated, mobile casino gaming could become a significant contributor to Zimbabwes digital economy, creating more jobs and generating tax revenue.\n\nDevelopers are likely to introduce more locally-themed casino games that appeal to Zimbabwean players, incorporating cultural elements and traditional games into digital formats. Additionally, as augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technology become more accessible, online casinos may start offering immersive gaming experiences that replicate the feel of a real casino.\n\nFor now, the combination of affordable smartphones, faster internet, and seamless mobile payments has created the perfect environment for mobile casino gaming to thrive. As more Zimbabweans discover the thrill of playing roulette, slots, and other online casino games, the industry will continue to evolve, offering bigger, better, and more engaging experiences.\n\nMobile gaming in Zimbabwe is more than just a passing trendits a digital revolution thats transforming entertainment, creating new opportunities, and reshaping how people engage with casino games. Whether youre a casual player spinning the reels on a slot machine or a seasoned bettor trying your luck at roulette, one thing is certain: the future of mobile gaming in Zimbabwe is bright.\n\n",

I can trade it for Nato membership, if there are such conditions, the Ukrainian president said in response to a question during a news conference.\n\nHis comments came after US President Donald Trump called Zelensky a dictator without elections earlier in the week.\n\nI wasnt offended, but a dictator would be, Zelensky, who was democratically elected in May 2019, responded on Sunday.\n\nI am focused on Ukraines security today, not in 20 years, I am not going to be in power for decades, he added.\n\nAccording to Ukrainian law, elections are suspended under martial law, which has been in place since Russias full-scale invasion in February 2022.\n\nZelensky is meeting Western leaders on Monday, some in person in Kyiv and some online, as they work out how to provide a post-war security where the US will not.\n\nHe said the topic of Ukraine joining Nato would be on the table at the meeting but he did not know how the discussions would finish. He hoped the meeting would be a turning point.\n\nOn the topic of Trump, Zelensky said that he wanted to see the US president as a partner to Ukraine and more than a mediator between Kyiv and Moscow.\n\nI really want it to be more than just mediationthats not enough, he said.\n\nWith the White House demanding that it gets access to billions of dollars worth of Ukraines natural minerals in exchange for the military aid it provided to date  and could in the future  Zelensky said US help so far had been agreed as grants, not loans.\n\nHe said he would not agree to a security deal which  in his words  would be paid off by generation after generation.\n\nWhen asked about a potential mineral deal, Zelensky said we are making progress, adding that Ukrainian and US officials had been in touch.\n\nWe are ready to share, the Ukrainian leader said, but made clear that Washington first needed to ensure Russian President Vladimir Putin ends this war.\n\nZelensky appeared relaxed as he faced questions from the worlds media. In previous years he had been more impassioned and even emotional, but on Sunday his approach was business-like.\n\nIf Ukraines leader rejects a Donald Trump-shaped peace proposal he does not agree with  as he suggested today  then it could have lasting consequences for the course of this war.\n\nZelenskys comments came hours after Russia launched its largest single drone attack on Ukraine yet, Ukrainian officials said.\n\nOn Saturday night, Ukraines Air Force Command spokesman Yuriy Ignat said a record 267 Russian drones were launched in a single, coordinated attack on the country.\n\nThirteen regions were targeted and while many of the drones were repelled, those that were not caused destruction to infrastructure and at least three casualties, emergency services said.\n\nUkraines Air Force reported that 138 of the drones were shot down and 119, which were decoy drones, were lost without negative consequences, likely due to jamming.\n\nIn Kyiv, the attack meant six hours of air alerts.\n\nIn a statement, Zelensky thanked Ukraines emergency services for their response and called for the support of Europe and US in facilitating a lasting and just peace.\n\nIn a post on X, Ukraines First Lady Olena Zelenska said that hundreds of drones had brought death and destruction overnight.\n\nIt was another night of explosions, burning houses and cars, and destroyed infrastructure, she wrote. Another night when people prayed for their loved ones to survive.\n\nOn Monday, the war will enter its fourth year.\n\nDiplomatic wrangling over a potential peace deal continues, with Ukraine, European allies and the US offering differing visions for how to end the conflict.\n\nThe US and Russia held preliminary talks in Saudi Arabia this week  without delegates from Europe, including Ukraine, present  which resulted in European leaders holding a hastily-arranged summit in Paris.\n\nZelensky criticised Ukraines exclusion from the US-Russia talks, saying Trump was living in a disinformation space governed by Moscow, prompting Trump to respond by calling the Ukrainian president a dictator.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron is expected to visit Washington on Monday, while UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will be there on Thursday.\n\nSir Keir has publicly backed Zelensky, reiterating the UKs ironclad support for Kyiv, and said he would discuss the importance of Ukraines sovereignty when he speaks to Trump.\n\nPope Francis  who is in hospital with respiratory illness  wrote in a remarks released on Sunday that the third anniversary of the war was a painful and shameful occasion for the whole of humanity.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com has invited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal) to discuss legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back, Mr. Madzima. This week, we want to discuss the changes to estate administration in Zimbabwe. Is there a wholesale change in how estates are administered, and when is this coming into effect?\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nThere is no wholesale change in how estates are managed in Zimbabwe. The Act is amending certain provisions of the laws administering estates.\n\nThe law that is being introduced is known as the Administration of Estates Amendment Act No. 3 of 2024 which is coming into effect on the 24thof February 2025\n\nThe new Act is amending certain provisions that are contained in the Administration of Estates Act Chapter {6:01} and the Sovereign Wealth Fund Act Chapter {22:20}\n\nReporter:In general terms what is the main purpose for this Amendment Act?\n\nVM: The main purpose of the Act is to convert the office of the Master into a body corporate, stand-alone entity, capable of suing and being sued in its name. The office is the Master is responsible for all estates and insolvency situations like corporate rescue and liquidations.\n\nIn furthering institutional independence for the Masters office, the new laws prescribe that a board of professionals be created whose chairperson has to be qualified as a High Court judge. It will be the duty of the board to determine policies and principles of how the office is managed on a day-to-day basis with a focus on ensuring financial management and operational efficiency.\n\nLong and short, the aim of the Act is to address inefficiencies through corporate governance, with a focus on accountability and judicial oversight in the operations of the Masters office.\n\nReporter: What are some of the amendments introduced that affect day-to-day estate administration?\n\nVM: One such amendment deals with what is to be done where there is a dispute or competition for appointment as the Executor Dative.\n\nFor those who are not aware, the Executor Dative is the person appointed by the Master or Court as responsible for the gathering of assets, establishing liabilities and beneficiaries and ultimately distributing the estate.\n\nSuch disputes on who is to be appointed arise where there is no will stating in clear terms who the testator wishes to be the executor.\n\nIn such circumstances,the new act states the order of preference in appointment as the surviving spouse failing which, next of kin, failing which creditors then failing them legatees.\n\nThe Master will have to apply to the High Court with his choice of executor and if the Master has good reasons against the appointment of any of the interested persons, he can appoint a professional or other fit and proper person. The surest way to oppose the Masters choice is for all interested persons to submit to the court on joint affidavit their preferred executor.\n\nReporter: I understand that the amendments also deal with the issue of removal of executors.\n\nVM: Yes that is true.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, the amendments do not override or remove the common law principles for the removal of executors by interested persons to the estate.\n\nThey address a situation where the Master on his own motion following his own enquiry is of the opinion that the executor should be removed for grounds that may include incompetence, illegality in appointment or unsuitability for the role due to physical or mental incapacity.\n\nHe the Master is obliged to apply to the High Court an affidavit justifying his reasons for removal of the executor. On receiving the application, the executor is suspended from his duties pending the decision of the Court. The Master, in the interim, assumes the role of the executor. The judges response can only dismiss the application if he receives an affidavit from an interested person to the estate that there is a good reason not to remove the executor.\n\nReporter: Is there any other amendment that could have an effect on day-to-day estate management by executors?\n\nVM: Where the executor wants to sell the property of the estate privately and not by public auction and the will does not forbid it. The executor is to produce to the Master an affidavit jointly sworn by all the interested persons to sell the property and if the Master is satisfied that it will be in the best interest of the estate that the property is sold privately, he shall grant his authority.\n\nIn the event that it is contested, the executor supported by the Master will make an application to the court which shall determine upon considering practical estate needs and beneficiary interests whether or not the property is sold privately.\n\nReporter: Do you foresee any challenges that may come about as a result of the amendments in the Act?\n\nVM: The additional board approval and court processes may slow down administration coupled with the normal transition risks into autonomy.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima atvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",
