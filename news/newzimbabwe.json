            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has reopened a bitter family battle over a multimillion-dollar lottery windfall after granting rescission of a default judgment against three members of the Sakala family, ruling that the dispute be heard on the merits.\n\nThe case stems from a 2019 jackpot win by the late Agnes Sakala, who shared her winnings with relatives through cash, houses, and vehicles.\n\nThe beneficiaries, including Heather Magodyo and brothers Prosper and Henry Sakala, insist the transfers were outright gifts, but Agnes later claimed they were loans that should be repaid  triggering a lawsuit that has torn the family apart.\n\nThe applicants failed to attend the initial hearing in October 2024 after their lawyers abandoned the case, leading the court to rule in favour of respondent Oliver Masomera (in his capacity as the appointed executor dative of the Estate Late Agnes Sakala DR 3480/23).\n\nBut Justice Joel Mambara, sitting at the Harare High Court, overturned that outcome, stressing that the default judgment had been unjust.\n\nDenying the applicants the opportunity to be heard could result in an injustice, the judge said.\n\nThere is nothing in the applicants conduct to suggest that they freely took the decision to refrain from appearing.\n\nThe judge also rejected arguments by the respondents that the Sakalas were negligent and had wilfully defaulted. The explanation they have offered is adequate, Mambara ruled, citing a communication breakdown caused by changes in legal representation.\n\nCentral to the rescission was whether the disputed transfers were gifts or loans  a question the court said required a full trial.\n\nA court is naturally reluctant to let a judgment stand against someone who insists they have a valid defence and who was not heard due to a mishap, Justice Mambara noted.\n\nThe justice of the case clearly favours letting this matter be heard on the merits, Mambara concluded.\n\nThe matter will now proceed to trial, with significant implications for how courts interpret family transactions tied to sudden wealth, such as lottery winnings.\n\nThe underlying dispute between the parties arises from a family financial transaction.\n\nThe late Agnes Sakala (the first respondent) came into a significant sum of money after winning a lottery in 2019.\n\nShe shared a portion of her winnings with members of her family, including the late Mr. Aaron Sakala and his family, who are the applicants herein, by way of gifts of money, houses, and motor vehicles. In particular, the first applicant states that the money given to her family was not a loan but an outright gift, and thus no repayment was ever expected.\n\nSometime later, a dispute arose when the first respondent claimed entitlement to repayment or to certain property, treating what was given as a loan rather than a gift.\n\nThis led him to issue a summons against the applicants.\n\nThe applicants duly entered an appearance to defend the action, as they maintain that the first respondents claim is without merit.\n\nThe matter did not proceed to trial promptly.\n\nAccording to the first applicant, the case lay dormant for an extended period after pleadings.\n\nCrucially, the legal practitioner who had been handling the matter for the first applicant left the law firm which was handling this matter during this lull and failed to transfer or properly hand over the case file to any other practitioner in the firm.\n\nMeanwhile, the second and third applicants (Prosper and Henry Sakala) were being represented by a different law firm.\n\nAt the time the action was commenced, the second and third applicants were minors, and they had little to no direct contact with their lawyer. They allege they were never informed of any hearing date by that lawyer.\n\nIn October 2024, the first respondent set the matter down for a default judgment hearing on the unopposed roll.\n\nNotice of the set down was served, but due to the above circumstances, none of the applicants nor their legal representatives became aware of the hearing.\n\nThe first applicants former lawyer was no longer at his firm, and no one there was actively handling the file.\n\nThe other applicants lawyer, on the other hand, had not kept them informed and did not attend.\n\nAs a result, when the case was called on 21 October 2024, the applicants were in default of appearance.\n\nThe High Court (sitting in default) granted judgment in favour of the first respondent, thereby giving him the relief he sought in the action.\n\nThe applicants state that they only learned of the default judgment weeks later, when a relative privy to the court outcome informed them.\n\nThey moved with haste to engage new legal counsel and prepared this rescission application, which was filed in November 2024.\n\nThe application was thus made within one month of the applicants gaining knowledge of the default judgment, satisfying the temporal requirement of Rule 27(1).\n\nThe applicants also obtained a provisional stay of execution pending the determination of this rescission application, given that the default judgment involved the transfer of substantial assets.\n\n",

The two markets, official and parallel, have maintained a close range, hovering between ZWG28, 00 to a high of ZWG34, 00 against the greenback.\n\nBut presenting a trading update for the companys first quarter period, Hippo Valley said the local unit still faces acceptance challenges.\n\nWhile the ZWG currency has shown relative stability since the significant devaluation experienced at the end of September 2024, it faces significant challenges, particularly in gaining widespread acceptance.\n\nThe tight liquidity conditions that prevailed during the quarter and the currency mix dilemma when trading using the ZWG currency resulted in episodes of excess ZWG cash balances for the company and USD working capital challenges, with most suppliers of goods and services, particularly the informal sector, continuing to favor the USD currency due to perceived stability, the company said.\n\nThe sugar producer said that despite the first quarter ending with relatively stable exchange rates, input costs were elevated due to inflationary pressures and geopolitical tensions as global trade policies shifted.\n\nIn terms of operations, the first quarter sugar production period ended on a positive note, marked by a 15% increase in cane supply from the companys plantations (miller-cum-planter), attributed to the higher milling crushing season.\n\nAdditionally, cane quality improved from an Estimated Recoverable Crystal of 11,30% to 11,46%.\n\nDespite some minimal mill start-up challenges, the plant had impressive recoveries, after achieving a cane sugar ratio of 8.49 against the prior year of 8.50 and the target of 8.75. Private cane deliveries marginally dropped due to diversions to the Triangle mill after the start-up challenges referred to above, the company added.\n\n",

They tabled a comprehensive set of recommendations to SADC Heads of State and Government, meeting this week.\n\nAmong the proposals were harmonising laws across statutory, religious, and customary systems to enforce the minimum marriage age of 18 without exceptions, establishing an Anti-Child Marriage Fund to finance survivor protection programmes such as safe homes, counselling, and reintegration services and\n\nEnsuring free healthcare, education, legal aid, and psychosocial support for survivors among other recommendations.\n\nThese recommendations emphasise the need for political will, legal clarity, survivor-centred services, community ownership, and adequate funding, the panel concluded.\n\nEquality Now, which has been campaigning against child marriage since 1995, stressed that regional governments must urgently align with the SADC Model Law on Eradicating Child Marriage, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and the Maputo Protocol.\n\nBy adopting and implementing these measures, SADC leaders can accelerate the eradication of child marriage, protect survivors, and uphold the rights and dignity of children across the region, the organisation said.\n\n",
