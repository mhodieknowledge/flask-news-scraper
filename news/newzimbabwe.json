            "content": "By Ashraf Hassen Coovadia l Daily Maverick\n\nWE all need to urgently recognise that climate change is not merely a distant socioeconomic issue  it is a current, unfolding health crisis affecting tens of millions globally.\n\nThe link between climate change and human health is well established, though perhaps not widely recognised by the public. This may be due to the issue being overshadowed by its economic and social implications, or insufficient emphasis in public discourse.\n\nThis week, the second G20 Health Working Group meeting is taking place in KwaZulu-Natal. While South Africas G20 health agenda looks at important issues such as stemming the tide of non-communicable diseases and Pandemic Prevention Preparedness and Response, there is a lack of focus on the impact of climate change on public health.\n\nHuman health is already being affected by climate change. To better understand these effects, its helpful to think in terms of direct and indirect pathways: those that are immediately visible and those with more delayed but substantial consequences.\n\nExtreme weather\n\nDirect impacts include the devastation caused by extreme weather events  storms, hurricanes and wildfires  which pose acute threats to survival.\n\nWhile these events often cause significant loss of life, many more are injured or displaced. Health systems are frequently overwhelmed, unable to manage the burden and critical services like immunisation programmes are disrupted.\n\nInfrastructure damage leads to economic hardship, exacerbating poverty and malnutrition, particularly among displaced populations.\n\nHeatwaves, occurring with increasing frequency and severity, directly affect health by causing dehydration, kidney dysfunction, heatstroke and even death. The number of such incidents is rising as these events become more common and prolonged.\n\nSome regions are now facing conditions that render them uninhabitable due to persistent extreme heat.\n\nIndirect consequences\n\nWhile direct effects impact on millions, most health consequences arise through slower, indirect pathways. These result from the disruption of ecosystems caused by rising temperatures and other human activities.\n\nOne notable example is the changing distribution of disease vectors. Mosquitoes that transmit diseases such as malaria and dengue are now thriving in new regions, with longer breeding seasons. This means that disease patterns across the globe are changing and healthcare systems need to adapt to this.\n\nAir quality is another critical area of concern. The link between pollution and respiratory health is well documented.\n\nWildfires that occur more often due to climate change produce fine particulate matter that can enter the lungs, worsening conditions such as asthma and chronic lung ailments.\n\nRising temperatures also increase ground-level ozone concentrations, further aggravating these conditions. Additionally, climate change has led to longer and more intense pollen seasons, contributing to the rise in allergic conditions such as hay fever and asthma.\n\nDiarrhoeal diseases are associated with climate change as we see a higher risk of infections that appear to have an increased prevalence in warmer temperatures, such as with Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium, rotaviruses, and parasites (eg Giardia and toxoplasmosis gondii). Diarrhoeal rates are also affected by the availability of safe drinking water, which in turn is affected by both droughts and flooding events.\n\nClimate change has also been shown to affect the rates of interpersonal violence through heat-driven aggression and resource conflicts. Studies have linked higher temperatures and extreme weather to increased homicide, intimate partner violence and conflict.\n\nMental health impacts of climate change range from direct trauma that can cause post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following an extreme weather disaster, to climate anxiety, especially in the youth, to displacement and loss of livelihood resulting from extreme weather events.\n\nThe 2023 Lancet Countdown names several vulnerable populations that are especially vulnerable to climate health risks:\n\nChildren are at higher risk due to their developing bodies and greater exposure;\n\nThe elderly, particularly those with pre-existing heart or lung conditions, are also at increased risk, especially during heatwaves;\n\nPregnant individuals represent another sensitive group, with growing evidence linking heat exposure to poor pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight, preterm births and stillbirths; and\n\nThose who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, as they often live in areas more exposed to environmental hazards, have limited access to healthcare and fewer resources to adapt or recover from climate-related events.\n\nWe all need to urgently recognise that climate change is not merely a distant socioeconomic issue  it is a current, unfolding health crisis affecting tens of millions globally.\n\nAvoiding this crisis requires changing our individual habits, but more importantly, it requires advocating and working in our own communities towards a systemic change.\n\nProf Ashraf Hassen Coovadia is the academic head of the Department of Paediatrics and Child Health at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg.\n\n",

And I will be waiting for Putin in Trkiye on Thursday. Personally, Zelensky wrote.He had earlier said his country was open to talks with Russia but only after a ceasefire was in place.Western powers called for a 30-day pause in fighting to begin on Monday after European leaders spearheading the so-called coalition of the willing met in Kyiv on Saturday.Putins offer of direct talks followed that intervention.On Sunday Trump then posted on social media that Ukraine should agree to this immediately and it would provide clarity on whether there was a way to end the war.At least they will be able to determine whether or not a deal is possible, and if it is not, European leaders, and the US, will know where everything stands, and can proceed accordingly he said, adding: Have the meeting, now!In his post on X, Zelensky said he hoped Russia would agree to the ceasefire before the talks.We await a full and lasting ceasefire, starting from tomorrow, to provide the necessary basis for diplomacy, he said.In a late-night address on Saturday, Putin invited Ukraine to take part in serious negotiations over the war, which began with Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.Putin said he could not rule out the possibility that the talks could result in Russia and Ukraine agreeing a new truce  but did not address the calls for a 30-day ceasefire directly.The Russian leader said: This would be the first step towards a long-term, lasting peace, rather than a prologue to more armed hostilities after the Ukrainian armed forces get new armaments and personnel, after feverish trench-digging and the establishment of new command posts.Moscow has previously said that before Russia could consider a ceasefire, the West must first halt its military aid to Ukraine.On Saturday, the Ukrainian president played host in Kyiv to UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Frances Emmanuel Macron, Germanys Friedrich Merz and Polands Donald Tusk, who later called Trump to discuss their plan.Sir Keir later told the BBC the US president was absolutely clear that their suggestion of an immediate ceasefire was a demand that must be met.Appearing at a news conference with Zelensky, they warned that new and massive sanctions would be imposed on Russias energy and banking sectors should Putin not agree to the unconditional 30-day ceasefire in the air, at sea and on land.\n\nHis post came shortly after Donald Trump demanded Ukraine agree to Putins offer of direct talks between the two countries in Turkey.\n\nThere is no point in prolonging the killings.

            "content": "By Anne Okumu & Brian Khisa l BBC News\n\nLESEGO Chombos enthusiasm for life is as infectious as her achievements are impressive: she has won the Miss Botswana 2022 and Miss World Africa 2024 crowns, is a working lawyer, has set up her own charitable foundation  and made history in November, becoming Botswanas youngest cabinet minister.\n\nShe was just 26 years old at the time  and had clearly impressed Botswanas incoming President Duma Boko, whose Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) had just won a landslide, ousting the party that had governed for 58 years.It was a seismic shift in the politics of the diamond-rich southern African nation  and Boko, a 55-year-old Harvard-trained lawyer, hit the ground running.His main focus, he said, was fixing an economy too reliant on diamonds, telling the BBC ahead of his inauguration that he wanted young people to be the solution  to become entrepreneurs, employ themselves and employ others.Key to this was finding a suitable ambassador  and Chombo was clearly it: a young woman already committed to various causes.He made her minister of youth and gender.Ive never been more proud to be young, she told the BBC at the ministrys headquarters in the capital, Gaborone.Im a young person living in Botswana, passionate about youth development, gender equality, but also so passionate about the development of children.The beauty queen did not campaign to be an MP  she is what is called a specially elected member of parliament  and is now one of just six female MPs in the 69-member National Assembly.Chombo said becoming an MP and then minister came as a complete surprise to her.I got appointed by a president who had never met me, she said.Miss World and the journey that I thought I was supposed to pursue as my final destination was only the platform through which I would be seen for this very role.It was her crowning as Miss Botswana in 2022 that raised her profile and enabled her to campaign for social change, while trying to inspire other young women.It also gave her the opportunity to set up the Lesego Chombo Foundation, which focuses on supporting disadvantaged youngsters and their parents in rural areas  and which she is still involved with, its projects funded by corporate companies and others.We strive to have a world where we feel seen and heard and represented. Im very thrilled that I happen to be the very essence of that representation, she said.Lesego Chombo, now 27, is an associate at a law firm in Gaborone.As she prepared for last years Miss World pageant, she said: I really put myself in the zone of service. I really channelled it for this big crown.Now in political office, she is aware of the expectations placed on her in a country where approximately 60% of the population is below 35 years.It also has a high level of unemployment  28%, which is even higher for young people and women who have limited economic opportunities and battle systemic corruption.Chombo said this was something she was determined to change: Currently in Botswana, the rates of unemployment are so high.But its not just the rate of unemployment, its also just the sphere of youth development.Its lacking, and so my desire is to create an ecosystem, an environment, a society, an economy in which youth can thrive.Chombo said her plan was to develop a comprehensive system that nurtured youth-led initiatives, strengthened entrepreneurship and ensured young people had a seat at the table when decisions were being made.With Botswanas anti-corruption policy undergoing a rigorous review, she said this would ensure that quotas for young entrepreneurs  when state departments and agencies put out tenders for goods and services  were actually reached.The government has begun a 10-month forensic audit of government spending that will include 30 state-owned enterprises.Indeed President Boko is intent on cracking down on corruption, seeing this as a way to bolter investor confidence and diversify the economy  something his deputy has been seeking to do on recent trips to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Switzerland.And a key deal has now been secured with UAE-based CCI Global, a provider of business process outsourcing, to open a hub in Botswana.While youth development is a central pillar of her work, gender equity also remains close to her heart.Her short time in office has coincided with a growing outcry over gender-based violence.According to a United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) report, over 67% of women in Botswana have experienced abuse, more than double the global average.It hurts to know that it could be me next, she admitted.A month into her appointment, she was criticised for voting against an opposition motion in parliament to create peace desks at police stations and magistrate courts to quickly deal with victims.At the time she said such provisions already existed within the law and what was needed was more public awareness.This was followed in January by a police report noting that at least 100 women had been raped and another 10 murdered during the festive season  this caused public outrage with many lashing out at her on social media over the issue.The minister reiterated  on several occasions, including before parliament in March  that Botswana had many laws and strategies in place and what was important was to ensure these they were actually applied.But she told the BBC the government would be pushing for the implementation of a Gender-Based Violence Act, aimed at closing legal loopholes that have long hindered justice for survivors.She said she was also advocating a more holistic approach, involving the ministries of health, education and local government.We want curriculums that promote gender equity from a young age, Chombo said.We want to teach children what gender-based violence is and how to prevent it.It will boil down to inclusion of teaching gender equity at home, how parents behave around their children, how they model good behaviour.She has also been vocal about the need to address issues affecting men, particularly around mental health and positive masculinity, encouraging chiefs to ensure that our patriarchal culture is not actively perpetuating gender violence.I hear a lot of people say: Why do you speak of women more than men?Its because as it stands in society, women are mostly prejudiced [against].But when we speak of gender equality, were saying that it should be applied equally for everyone. But what we strive for is gender equity.Chombo, who studied law at the University of Botswana, said she was thankful to her mother and other strong women for inspiring her  saying that women had to work 10 times harder to succeed.[My mother] has managed to create an environment for me to thrive. And growing up, I got to realise that its not an easy thing.As women, we face so many pressures: A woman cannot do this. A woman cant do that. A woman cant be young and in leadership. Im currently facing that.She also credited Julia Morley, the CEO of Miss World, for helping her: She has managed to create a legacy of what we call beauty with a purpose for so many young girls across the world.She has just inspired us so deeply to take up social responsibility.Chombo is serious about this. The beauty queen-cum-lawyer-cum-minister knows she has made history  but is also aware that her real work has only just begun.Impact. Tangible impact. Thats what success would look like to me, she said.I want to look back and see that it is there and it is sustainable.

Im very thrilled that I happen to be the very essence of that representation, she said.Lesego Chombo, now 27, is an associate at a law firm in Gaborone.As she prepared for last years Miss World pageant, she said: I really put myself in the zone of service. I really channelled it for this big crown.Now in political office, she is aware of the expectations placed on her in a country where approximately 60% of the population is below 35 years.It also has a high level of unemployment  28%, which is even higher for young people and women who have limited economic opportunities and battle systemic corruption.Chombo said this was something she was determined to change: Currently in Botswana, the rates of unemployment are so high.But its not just the rate of unemployment, its also just the sphere of youth development.Its lacking, and so my desire is to create an ecosystem, an environment, a society, an economy in which youth can thrive.Chombo said her plan was to develop a comprehensive system that nurtured youth-led initiatives, strengthened entrepreneurship and ensured young people had a seat at the table when decisions were being made.With Botswanas anti-corruption policy undergoing a rigorous review, she said this would ensure that quotas for young entrepreneurs  when state departments and agencies put out tenders for goods and services  were actually reached.The government has begun a 10-month forensic audit of government spending that will include 30 state-owned enterprises.Indeed President Boko is intent on cracking down on corruption, seeing this as a way to bolter investor confidence and diversify the economy  something his deputy has been seeking to do on recent trips to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Switzerland.And a key deal has now been secured with UAE-based CCI Global, a provider of business process outsourcing, to open a hub in Botswana.While youth development is a central pillar of her work, gender equity also remains close to her heart.Her short time in office has coincided with a growing outcry over gender-based violence.According to a United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) report, over 67% of women in Botswana have experienced abuse, more than double the global average.It hurts to know that it could be me next, she admitted.A month into her appointment, she was criticised for voting against an opposition motion in parliament to create peace desks at police stations and magistrate courts to quickly deal with victims.At the time she said such provisions already existed within the law and what was needed was more public awareness.This was followed in January by a police report noting that at least 100 women had been raped and another 10 murdered during the festive season  this caused public outrage with many lashing out at her on social media over the issue.The minister reiterated  on several occasions, including before parliament in March  that Botswana had many laws and strategies in place and what was important was to ensure these they were actually applied.But she told the BBC the government would be pushing for the implementation of a Gender-Based Violence Act, aimed at closing legal loopholes that have long hindered justice for survivors.She said she was also advocating a more holistic approach, involving the ministries of health, education and local government.We want curriculums that promote gender equity from a young age, Chombo said.We want to teach children what gender-based violence is and how to prevent it.It will boil down to inclusion of teaching gender equity at home, how parents behave around their children, how they model good behaviour.She has also been vocal about the need to address issues affecting men, particularly around mental health and positive masculinity, encouraging chiefs to ensure that our patriarchal culture is not actively perpetuating gender violence.I hear a lot of people say: Why do you speak of women more than men?Its because as it stands in society, women are mostly prejudiced [against].But when we speak of gender equality, were saying that it should be applied equally for everyone. But what we strive for is gender equity.Chombo, who studied law at the University of Botswana, said she was thankful to her mother and other strong women for inspiring her  saying that women had to work 10 times harder to succeed.[My mother] has managed to create an environment for me to thrive.

I really channelled it for this big crown.Now in political office, she is aware of the expectations placed on her in a country where approximately 60% of the population is below 35 years.It also has a high level of unemployment  28%, which is even higher for young people and women who have limited economic opportunities and battle systemic corruption.Chombo said this was something she was determined to change: Currently in Botswana, the rates of unemployment are so high.But its not just the rate of unemployment, its also just the sphere of youth development.Its lacking, and so my desire is to create an ecosystem, an environment, a society, an economy in which youth can thrive.Chombo said her plan was to develop a comprehensive system that nurtured youth-led initiatives, strengthened entrepreneurship and ensured young people had a seat at the table when decisions were being made.With Botswanas anti-corruption policy undergoing a rigorous review, she said this would ensure that quotas for young entrepreneurs  when state departments and agencies put out tenders for goods and services  were actually reached.The government has begun a 10-month forensic audit of government spending that will include 30 state-owned enterprises.Indeed President Boko is intent on cracking down on corruption, seeing this as a way to bolter investor confidence and diversify the economy  something his deputy has been seeking to do on recent trips to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Switzerland.And a key deal has now been secured with UAE-based CCI Global, a provider of business process outsourcing, to open a hub in Botswana.While youth development is a central pillar of her work, gender equity also remains close to her heart.Her short time in office has coincided with a growing outcry over gender-based violence.According to a United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) report, over 67% of women in Botswana have experienced abuse, more than double the global average.It hurts to know that it could be me next, she admitted.A month into her appointment, she was criticised for voting against an opposition motion in parliament to create peace desks at police stations and magistrate courts to quickly deal with victims.At the time she said such provisions already existed within the law and what was needed was more public awareness.This was followed in January by a police report noting that at least 100 women had been raped and another 10 murdered during the festive season  this caused public outrage with many lashing out at her on social media over the issue.The minister reiterated  on several occasions, including before parliament in March  that Botswana had many laws and strategies in place and what was important was to ensure these they were actually applied.But she told the BBC the government would be pushing for the implementation of a Gender-Based Violence Act, aimed at closing legal loopholes that have long hindered justice for survivors.She said she was also advocating a more holistic approach, involving the ministries of health, education and local government.We want curriculums that promote gender equity from a young age, Chombo said.We want to teach children what gender-based violence is and how to prevent it.It will boil down to inclusion of teaching gender equity at home, how parents behave around their children, how they model good behaviour.She has also been vocal about the need to address issues affecting men, particularly around mental health and positive masculinity, encouraging chiefs to ensure that our patriarchal culture is not actively perpetuating gender violence.I hear a lot of people say: Why do you speak of women more than men?Its because as it stands in society, women are mostly prejudiced [against].But when we speak of gender equality, were saying that it should be applied equally for everyone. But what we strive for is gender equity.Chombo, who studied law at the University of Botswana, said she was thankful to her mother and other strong women for inspiring her  saying that women had to work 10 times harder to succeed.[My mother] has managed to create an environment for me to thrive.

That when I leave, someone else is able to carry it through.Additional reporting from Innocent Selatlhwa in Gaborone.\n\nWith Botswanas anti-corruption policy undergoing a rigorous review, she said this would ensure that quotas for young entrepreneurs  when state departments and agencies put out tenders for goods and services  were actually reached.\n\nThe government has begun a 10-month forensic audit of government spending that will include 30 state-owned enterprises.Indeed President Boko is intent on cracking down on corruption, seeing this as a way to bolter investor confidence and diversify the economy  something his deputy has been seeking to do on recent trips to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Switzerland.And a key deal has now been secured with UAE-based CCI Global, a provider of business process outsourcing, to open a hub in Botswana.While youth development is a central pillar of her work, gender equity also remains close to her heart.Her short time in office has coincided with a growing outcry over gender-based violence.According to a United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) report, over 67% of women in Botswana have experienced abuse, more than double the global average.It hurts to know that it could be me next, she admitted.A month into her appointment, she was criticised for voting against an opposition motion in parliament to create peace desks at police stations and magistrate courts to quickly deal with victims.At the time she said such provisions already existed within the law and what was needed was more public awareness.This was followed in January by a police report noting that at least 100 women had been raped and another 10 murdered during the festive season  this caused public outrage with many lashing out at her on social media over the issue.The minister reiterated  on several occasions, including before parliament in March  that Botswana had many laws and strategies in place and what was important was to ensure these they were actually applied.But she told the BBC the government would be pushing for the implementation of a Gender-Based Violence Act, aimed at closing legal loopholes that have long hindered justice for survivors.She said she was also advocating a more holistic approach, involving the ministries of health, education and local government.We want curriculums that promote gender equity from a young age, Chombo said.We want to teach children what gender-based violence is and how to prevent it.It will boil down to inclusion of teaching gender equity at home, how parents behave around their children, how they model good behaviour.She has also been vocal about the need to address issues affecting men, particularly around mental health and positive masculinity, encouraging chiefs to ensure that our patriarchal culture is not actively perpetuating gender violence.I hear a lot of people say: Why do you speak of women more than men?Its because as it stands in society, women are mostly prejudiced [against].But when we speak of gender equality, were saying that it should be applied equally for everyone. But what we strive for is gender equity.Chombo, who studied law at the University of Botswana, said she was thankful to her mother and other strong women for inspiring her  saying that women had to work 10 times harder to succeed.[My mother] has managed to create an environment for me to thrive. And growing up, I got to realise that its not an easy thing.As women, we face so many pressures: A woman cannot do this. A woman cant do that. A woman cant be young and in leadership. Im currently facing that.She also credited Julia Morley, the CEO of Miss World, for helping her: She has managed to create a legacy of what we call beauty with a purpose for so many young girls across the world.She has just inspired us so deeply to take up social responsibility.Chombo is serious about this.
