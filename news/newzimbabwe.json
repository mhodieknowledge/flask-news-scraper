King has successfully led cross-functional teams, championed innovation, and delivered transformative technology solutions across diverse sectors and regions, Meikles Limited added.\n\n",

The funds will be used for a 3-5-day test run of the Zulu Mine, the acquisition of a flotation plant and the settlement of outstanding creditor and staff payments.\n\nThe miner said current stock price reached 0.014 pence, up 18% on Monday afternoon in London.\n\nThe Premier African Minerals Ltd CEO George Roach expressed gratitude to raw materials suppliers for enabling production restart.\n\nThanks to the outstanding support we have received from each of the original equipment manufacturer suppliers associated with all the plant components from the mill to final flotation, we have been able to restart the plant late afternoon on 6 July 2025, he said.\n\nHe said the plant has run with limited feed to allow for checks on the operation of each of the plant components and process integration up to the spodumene cleaner cell inserts that will be brought into the process today once sealants have hardened.\n\nAll being well, ore from the run-of-mine pad will be fed from today and commissioning and optimisation of the primary spodumene flotation plant will follow, added Roach.\n\n",

It is not the City Church Centre. It is the City Sports Centre and it is going to remain that. The City Sports Centre will remain a quintessentially sports facility where people play indoor games and we are going to make it better.\n\nWhen we went to the meeting, the President directed that Prevail Group of Companies assist the Council to renew and modernise that facility and we are going to do exactly that.\n\nThese are the kind of partnerships that we require so that we develop modern facilities that are in keeping with modern day standards and that will make our children grow and live in Harare, said Mafume.\n\nThe deal to revamp the City Sports Centre by Tungwararas company follows a similarly controversial agreement between the council and Geo Pomona, which has taken over refuse collection in the capital.\n\nHarare City Council is also partnering with ZANU PF Member of Parliament Pedzai Scott Sakupwanya for a sports ground he is constructing in Mabvuku and has proposed a lease agreement for Rufaro Stadium.\n\nDespite previously opposing partnerships with private entities, Mafume appears to have softened his stance by endorsing the Geo Pomona and Prevail Group deals.\n\nMafume said partnerships with private players are crucial for the development of the Citys facilities.\n\nA city is build by the Citizens in it. Citizens in it are the cooperates, churches, individuals, NGOs and everybody. We want to encourage people to come and work with us and be in partnership. When we partner with someone there is no way they can put the land in their pocket, said Mafume.\n\nThe City Sports Centre reflects the dire state of council-owned facilities, which have deteriorated due to municipal neglect.\n\nIn 2022, Mafume blocked a proposed deal by businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei to renovate Rufaro Stadium but has since failed to revive the iconic Mbare structure.\n\n",

Detectives then pounced and the two tried to flee when police revealed their identities, but were swiftly apprehended.\n\nThe pangolin  a female weighing 8.7 kilogrammes was rescued alive and taken to veterinary authorities for medical assessment and care.\n\nIn a statement following sentencing, the National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) said the mandatory nine-year sentence on the two offenders sends a clear message that wildlife crimes are serious offences, and that pangolins are an endangered species.\n\nPangolins are a national treasure, and any attempt to profit from pangolin trafficking will be met with the full force of the law, the NPAZ noted.\n\n",

As a government, we also recognise the various roles you play, the different hats you wear, the responsibilities you carry, and the sacrifices you make, Dinha said.\n\nThe deputy minister stated that her ministry recognised the vital role played by men in shaping their families.\n\nWe acknowledge your never-ending love, your guidance, and your support. You are the pillars of strength that provide stability and security for your families and the nation at large, added the deputy minister.\n\nHowever, because of their roles nature as fathers and employees of the public service, Dinha pointed out that financial stability was crucial for mens well-being.\n\nMens health is a critical issue that contributes to productivity in the organisation.\n\nStress can have devastating effects on mens mental health.\n\nI encourage you to practice stress management techniques such as exercise, being mindful and social support.\n\nI also encourage you to always prioritise your health, seek medical care when needed, and adopt healthy habits despite your busy schedules.\n\nAdded Dinha, To the nation, I call upon us to support men in their roles. Let us celebrate the selfless love, dedication of men and continue to build a society that values and supports men at the workplace and in our homes, she said, urging all men to prioritise their well-being and seek support when needed.\n\nDue to the economic hardships in Zimbabwe, most men are struggling to cope with the day-to-day provision of family needs and many of them have been affected.\n\nSpeaking at the same occasion, Mens Clinic International Marketing manager Philip Jonhera said research had shown that men have poor health-seeking behaviour, hence they should focus on medical check-ups focusing especially prostate cancer which is affecting young men in their thirties.\n\nThere is your spiritual health, there is your physical health, and there is your mental health, if you do not balance all three sections, I wont balance the diet, he said.\n\n",
