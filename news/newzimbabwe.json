We are on a mission to check whether there was value for money over the money that the government invested during the COVID-19 era.\n\nAs you are aware, when COVID hit us, we were not prepared, so government released money to various institutions of higher learning for the purposes of producing masks and sanitisers and other stuff that were related to the COVID-19 situation that was prevailing at that particular time.\n\nAfter that, the Auditor General is mandated by the Constitution of Zimbabwe to do a value for money audit just to see whether the resources that were deployed were used properly and whether there was value for money.\n\nSo I must confirm that indeed, from what we have seen, there was value for money. For example, here they received about ZWL$3 million and they managed to grow that ZWL$3 million by 47 times.\n\nHe added, We urge the government to put more resources towards innovation hubs so that we can reduce our import bill as a country, and we will be pointing out those areas in our report when we table the report in Parliament sometime.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nPRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwas special advisor, Paul Tungwarara, will oversee the renovations of the Harare City Council-owned City Sports Centre following years of deterioration and neglect by the municipality.\n\nTungwarara, through his company, Prevail Group, has been awarded the contract to refurbish the council-owned facility, though details of the deal remain unclear.\n\nAddressing the media recently, Harare Mayor Jacob Mafume revealed that the deal was endorsed by President Mnangagwa, with Prevail Group selected to lead the renovations of the City Sports Centre.\n\nWe are going to be assisted in renewing the City Sports Centre which was being turned into the City Church Centre. It is not the City Church Centre. It is the City Sports Centre and it is going to remain that. The City Sports Centre will remain a quintessentially sports facility where people play indoor games and we are going to make it better.\n\nWhen we went to the meeting, the President directed that Prevail Group of Companies assist the Council to renew and modernise that facility and we are going to do exactly that.\n\nThese are the kind of partnerships that we require so that we develop modern facilities that are in keeping with modern day standards and that will make our children grow and live in Harare, said Mafume.\n\nThe deal to revamp the City Sports Centre by Tungwararas company follows a similarly controversial agreement between the council and Geo Pomona, which has taken over refuse collection in the capital.\n\nHarare City Council is also partnering with ZANU PF Member of Parliament Pedzai Scott Sakupwanya for a sports ground he is constructing in Mabvuku and has proposed a lease agreement for Rufaro Stadium.\n\nDespite previously opposing partnerships with private entities, Mafume appears to have softened his stance by endorsing the Geo Pomona and Prevail Group deals.\n\nMafume said partnerships with private players are crucial for the development of the Citys facilities.\n\nA city is build by the Citizens in it. Citizens in it are the cooperates, churches, individuals, NGOs and everybody. We want to encourage people to come and work with us and be in partnership. When we partner with someone there is no way they can put the land in their pocket, said Mafume.\n\nThe City Sports Centre reflects the dire state of council-owned facilities, which have deteriorated due to municipal neglect.\n\nIn 2022, Mafume blocked a proposed deal by businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei to renovate Rufaro Stadium but has since failed to revive the iconic Mbare structure.\n\n",
