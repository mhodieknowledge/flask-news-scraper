            "content": "Botswana has declared a public health emergency, with President Duma Boko saying the national medical supply chain collapsed due to depleted government coffers and steep cuts in aid from the United States.\n\nThe announcement came on Monday after the Ministry of Health and Wellness warned earlier this month that the system was severely strained with $75m owed to private health facilities and suppliers.\n\nIt cited shortages of medicines for a range of illnesses, including hypertension, cancer, diabetes, tuberculosis, asthma, mental and sexual health, and stated that elective surgeries were postponed.\n\nThe Health Ministry also said there were shortages of dressings and sutures.\n\nThe medical supply chain, as run by central medical stores, has failed, President Boko said in a televised address on Monday. This failure has led to a severe disruption to health supplies countrywide.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance had earlier approved 250 million pula ($18.7m) in emergency funding for procurement, said Boko, adding that the military would oversee the distribution of emergency medicines, with the first shipments dispatching immediately from the capital, Gaborone, with priority given to deprived rural areas.\n\nThe current prices [for medicine] often are inflated five to 10 times. Under the current economic conditions, this scenario is not sustainable, Boko added.\n\nThe crisis is also linked to a shrinking national budget caused by the ongoing downturn in the global diamond market.\n\nBotswana, with a population of 2.5 million, is one of the worlds largest diamond producers. Its vast diamond reserves, discovered just after independence from Britain in 1966, make up about 80 percent of the countrys foreign earnings.\n\nBut sales have weakened in recent years, pushing a cash-strapped government to suspend certain ministerial purchases last month.\n\nSweeping cuts in aid from the US under President Donald Trump have further strained the economy. Before the cuts, the US funded a third of BotswanasHIV response, according to UNAIDS, and provided $12m through The Global Fund to fight malaria and tuberculosis.\n\nThe United Nations agency for children (UNICEF) said urgent action was needed to address the deepening medical crisis in the country, adding that one in five children was underweight in a western district near the Namibian border.\n\n",

Containing pumps, pipes, sprinklers, and related equipment, these productivity booster kits are meant to assist farmers in handling the challenges posed by climate change.\n\nSpeaking at thelaunch of the productivity booster kit programme in Mazowe on Monday, Mnangagwa said the equipment will be made available to tobacco smallholder farmers.\n\nMy Government plans to allocate US$1.98 billion over 10 years as a loan for the Productivity Booster Kit Programme. Additionally, five banks have committed to providing additional working capital.\n\nThe Productivity Booster Kits will also be made available to smallholder tobacco farmers, to localise the procurement of farming equipment and other aspects of the tobacco value chain, said Mnangagwa.\n\nA total of 10,000 farmers have been targeted to benefit from the first phase of the programme, with each receiving US$6,000 for the acquisition of the productivity booster kits.\n\nAccording to Mnangagwa, as a result of the kits, A1 farmers are estimated to contribute US$6.14 billion to the agricultural sector GDP from the envisaged production of 10 million tons per year.\n\nThe productivity kits are earmarked to alleviate the country from the consequences of climate change.\n\nMnangagwa further said the target is to irrigate more than 400,000 hectares of land by 2030.\n\nThe devastating effects of the El Nio-induced drought during the 2023/2024 season, among other experiences, have shown us the urgent need to climate-proof agriculture. To this end, we have set for ourselves an ambitious and achievable target to develop 496,000 hectares of land under irrigation by 2030, with over 350,000 hectares under summer cereal production, he added.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has dismissed former cabinet minister Walter Mzembis bid for bail pending trial, ruling that his seven-year absence from court showed a wilful disregard for the law and made him an untrustworthy candidate for release.\n\nJustice Maxwell Dembure, handing down judgment in Harare, said the ex-minister  facing charges of theft of trust property involving over US$1 million in public assets  failed to prove any exceptional circumstances justifying his freedom.\n\nIt is common cause that the appellant was on outstanding warrants of arrest for almost seven years, Justice Dembure said. There was nothing to show that he was incapacitated or bedridden for all these years until June 2025. Clearly, the evidence was not convincing.\n\nMzembi, who fled the country in 2018 after being granted temporary release of his passport for medical treatment in South Africa, only resurfaced in June 2025. He argued that his cancer treatment explained his absence and that changed circumstances, including the withdrawal of charges against his co-accused, warranted his release on bail.\n\nBut the judge was unmoved, stressing that the existence of new facts does not automatically result in the applicant being granted bail.\n\nDembure found that Mzembis conduct had caused the prolonged delay in bringing the case to trial: His long absence from the jurisdiction of the court clearly caused the delay in the finalisation of his case. Having made his bed, he must lie on it.\n\nThe court also rejected arguments based on property title deeds tendered as surety. Those averments do not plead the issue of title deeds as a ground for bail on changed circumstances, ruled Dembure.\n\nIf the court was convinced that, despite the long default, he could be trusted with his liberty, it would have accepted them earlier. It did not.\n\nConcluding, the judge said there was no basis to interfere with the magistrates original decision to revoke Mzembis bail.\n\nThe appeal is completely without merit. It must fail, he ruled.\n\nMzembi will remain in custody pending trial.\n\n",
