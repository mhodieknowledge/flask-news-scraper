The event will run from the 25thto the 27thof April at The Westin Hotel, Dallas-Fort Worth.\n\nSpeaking to NewZimbabwe.com ahead of the event, Nyazema said it is important for the diaspora community to appreciate that the multi-currency system will be maintained until 2030.\n\nThis approach provides clarity and fosters favourable investment decisions. Notably, the tight Monetary Policy stance by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) contains interventions aimed at establishing price stability and improving the efficiency of foreign exchange markets. This includes the launch of the new currency, ZWG, in April 2025 leading to a strategic reduction in money supply growth, and a focus on strengthening foreign currency reserves, he said.\n\nNyazema said property-wise, CBZH is providing services throughout the real estate value chain under the Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), where they are directly participating in the creation of housing stock for sale.\n\nThe institution is currently implementing projects like the Northgate in Harare, Athelney in Ruwa and Gateway City in Mutare, currently on sale, backed by US$ denominated mortgages for property purchase, building finance and property.\n\nThe top banker added that CBZ Holdings has since established a dedicated unit within our organization focused exclusively on serving the diaspora market, staffed with a committed team of relationship managers ready to extend support round the clock.\n\nIndeed, our journey commenced last year in the UK, serving as a significant eye-opener and unlocking numerous opportunities. The USA trip represents a strategic initiative in our efforts to expand our presence and engage with the global market.\n\n",

This stadium was singing. This stadium was full to the brim, and all they asked from the players was 90 minutes of passion and dedication. 90 minutes of being locked in. 90 minutes of fighting for the badge, and they did it for only 80 minutes, the angry supporter said on the Football Fans Tribe YouTube page.\n\nIt was a loss of concentration. They lost concentration and the motivation to attack. You praise the coach when the tactics work, and you have to blame him when they dont work, he carried on, taking issue with new coach Eric Chelle selecting players out of position.\n\nWATCH | An angry Nigerian man claims that Zimbabwes Warriors have nothing to play for. He made this remark after Zimbabwes draw with Nigeria in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers.pic.twitter.com/Gp2bQWkhAo\n\nWhy dont you play the fullbacks in their natural positions so they can give the strikers the crosses that they need, not forcing [Ola] Aina to cross with his left foot. The left side was the only side that we could have used, but out wingers let us down.\n\nHe carried on: I feel bad for Osimhen. I feel bad for [Calvin] Bassey. I feel back for [Wilfred] Ndidi. I feel bad for [William] Troost-Ekong. I feel bad for [Stanley] Nwabali because they dont deserve this result.\n\nThey worked their a** off. They put the passion, blood, sweat and tears into this team, but yet, some other people just have to get onto their private jets go to their individual clubs and collect their money If they dont qualify for the World Cup, who will pay more? Is it the fans or it it them because the fans are doing their part and the players are not.\n\nWe asked the fans to come fill up the stadium and they did. We asked them to shout and sing, and they did. All we asked [from them] is a win. And were not asking for it against hard competition. This is frikkin Zimbabwe. They are not qualifying for the World Cup. They are not playing for anything. You are paying for everything. Where was that spirit?\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nHELEN Zille, the federal chairperson of the Democratic Alliance (DA) in South Africa, has called on opposition leaders in Zimbabwe to unite and take advantage of the internal divisions in the ruling Zanu-PF party.\n\nShe made the remarks following a meeting with Zimbabwe People First chairperson, Stephen Mazanza, last week.\n\nShe reiterated that the current political landscape in Zimbabwe is toxic and does not reflect what the people voted for in terms of economic and political stability.\n\nZimbabwes political giants have failed the masses, and sooner rather than later, Zimbabweans need to put enough or necessary pressure on the government, either in the form of petitions, meetings, or demonstrations, so that the Zanu PF government yields to the peoples demands.\n\nThe central bank (Zimbabwe Reserve Bank) has failed to come up with sound policies to stabilise the economy and there might be a need to abandon both the US dollar, and the ZiG currencies and adopt the South African Rand whilst the RBZ is put under administration by the South African Federal Reserve until it can stand on its own, she said.\n\nZille said opposition leaders, including Nelson Chamisa, Elisabeth Valerio and Tendai Biti, among others must immediately sit down and form a grand coalition that will challenge the ruling party and set itself in motion to take over the power vacuum in case the infighting within Zanu PF self-destructs as widely predicted.\n\nShe underscored that there has been widespread and loud noises of a unity government from within diehard Zanu PF ranks, which again is a signal of instability within, but immediately urged the opposition parties to be very cautious.\n\nOn his part, Mazanza said the meeting with Zille was pivotal and driven by the urgent need to address the catastrophic situation facing Zimbabweans.\n\nHe said the engagement was not merely a discussion but aplea for solidarity against the systematic destructionofthe nation which he described as suffocating under the weight of suppression of freedom of expression, the silencing of dissenting voices is a hallmark of this regime, and rampant corruption and nepotism.\n\nState resources are being plundered for personal gain, enriching a select few while the masses suffer. Police brutality and political purges targeting opposition members and concerned citizens are rampant. Vital institutions are being hijacked by individuals to serve their interests, and undermining the foundations of our society, he said.\n\nThe opposition leader accused the governments policies of creating a stark divide, leaving the majority impoverished and the economy on a freefall, which has escalated citizens hardship.\n\nWe also discussed the internal instability in Zanu PF and its potential to further destabilise the country. We are preparing for all possible outcomes, and we are determined to ensure that any power vacuum is filled by a government that represents the will of the people, he added.\n\n",
