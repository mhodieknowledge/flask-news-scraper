I am banned, he said on Tuesday.\n\nSoyinka has long been critical of the Trump administrations radical stance on immigration and linked the visa revocation to his outspoken criticism.\n\nHe said his recent comparison of Trump to Ugandas dictator  Idi Amin in white face  may have contributed to the current situation.\n\nWhen I called Donald Trump Idi Amin, I thought I was paying him a compliment, Soyinka said, hes been behaving like a dictator.\n\nIdi Amin was a Ugandan military officer and dictator who ruled the country from 1971 to 1979, infamous for his brutal regime and widespread human rights abuses.\n\nWhen asked if he would consider going back to the US, Soyinka said: How old am I?\n\nIn July, the US State Department announced sweeping changes to its non-immigrant visa policy for citizens of Nigeria and several other African countries.\n\nAccording to the policy, nearly all non-immigrant and non-diplomatic visas issued to Nigerians and nationals of Cameroon, Ethiopia and Ghana would now be single-entry and valid for only three months, rolling back the up to five-year, multiple-entry visas they had enjoyed previously.\n\n",

However, a circuit breaker supplying the load tripped, resulting in the blackout.\n\nIn an internal memo seen by this publication, ZESA Group Chief Executive Officer Cletus Nyachowe informed Gurupira of his immediate suspension pending a full investigation.\n\nI am hereby suspending you from duty pending investigations, following a spate of power outages prior to the commencement of the ZANU PF Conference in Mutare and during the State of the Nation Address in Parliament on the 28th of October 2025, Nyachowe wrote.\n\nThe correspondence stated that Gurupira would remain on full pay and benefits during the suspension period.\n\nDuring the period of suspension, you are not to communicate with any ZESA Holdings Group staff, Nyachowe added.\n\n",

The SAPES Trust was set to hold a National Press Conference coordinated by civic society against the 2030 agenda, said ZCTU Secretary-General Tirivanhu Marimo in a statement.\n\nHe called for an immediate end to all forms of intimidation targeting individuals or institutions seeking to express themselves freely on national issues.\n\nWe view the latest bombings as a warning to the general populace and institutions opposed to the 2030 agenda. In that regard, the perpetrators are brazenly undermining the democratic rights of citizens to hold and express their own views.\n\nWe fear that the country may descend into serious anarchy if these actions go unchecked. We call upon the police to investigate the matter thoroughly so that the perpetrators face the full wrath of the law, Marimo added.\n\n",

The approach involves maintaining a high bank policy rate, currently at 35%,to curb speculative borrowing, which has been a major driver of excess liquidity and illicit parallel market activity.\n\nOther measures, such as elevated reserve requirements, have also been introduced to control inflation while supporting long-term economic growth.\n\nAs a result, the policy has helped sustain the ZWG currency, which has enjoyed nearly a year of relative stability, encouraging broader acceptance and usage.\n\nPresenting the State of the Nation Address (SONA), Mnangagwa credited the RBZs monetary discipline for fostering a favourable economic environment.\n\nThe tight monetary and fiscal environment in the economy has remained favourable to support sustained economic activity. My Government is diligently implementing the necessary policies, measures, and initiatives to maintain the stability of the ZWG and inflation, he said.\n\nThe President added that the ongoing trend of macroeconomic stability is expected to become a permanent feature of Zimbabwes economy.\n\nHe also highlighted significant progress in the countrys foreign currency generation capacity.\n\nInflows stood at US$10.4 billion as of August 2025, an increase of 26.8% from the US$8.3 billion recorded during the same period in 2024. Consequently, foreign currency reserves rose to about US$900 million by the end of September 2025, up from US$700 million in June 2025.\n\nIn recognition of this progress, the World Bank recently ranked Zimbabwe first among the top 10 countries globally that have made significant gains in foreign currency reserve accumulation. On the fiscal front, I am pleased to advise that we remain steadfast in strengthening sustainable resource mobilisation strategies to ensure the continued provision of public services, Mnangagwa added.\n\n",
