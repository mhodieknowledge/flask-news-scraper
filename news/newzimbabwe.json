            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has dismissed an application by the Zion Apostolic Sect which was suing Chirumanzu Rural District Council (RDC) for contempt of court following a US$900,000 property deal gone wrong.\n\nSitting at the Masvingo High Court, Justice Jester Charewa threw out the application, ruling that there is no evidence.\n\nThe judge said that while it is true that the pace of compliance with a court order by the RDC has been painfully slow, there has, nevertheless, been substantial compliance.\n\nAccordingly, as at the time of the hearing, the burden of the required full compliance, which forms the basis of this application rests heavily on the applicant itself: to first fulfil the transfer requirements.\n\nOn balance, therefore, I cannot, in the circumstances, find that the respondent can be held to be in contempt as there is no evidence of a failure to disobey a clear and unambiguous court order, but rather, evidence of tardy compliance coupled by applicant itself failing to fulfil transfer requirements.\n\nConsequently, wilfulness and mala fides being presumed from a failure to comply with a court order, I am of the view that the respondent has discharged the onus that it did comply with the court order, said the judge before she threw the application.\n\nThe background is that on 2 October 2017, the parties entered into a deed of settlement in HC1245/17, wherein the church had sued the respondent for payment of US$900,000.00.\n\nThe settlement was to the effect that in lieu of the monetary claim, and in full and final settlement of any claims between the parties, the respondent would allocate and, within a reasonable time, transfer (at applicants cost) two institutional stands to applicant.\n\nFurther,Chirumanzu RDCwould fence off its sewer ponds within the applicants farm withinsixmonths of the date of the deed of settlement.\n\nZion Apostolic Church said the RDCfailed to adhere to the terms of the deed of settlement.\n\nThe church was, accordingly and upon suing for specific performance on the deed of settlement, granted an order on 19 April 2023.\n\nThe order required the RDC to allocate and transfer two institutional standswithin 14 days of the grant of the order.\n\nIt was also supposed to fence off, with a fence appropriate to keep wild animals and the applicants livestock from consuming sewer pond water, sewer ponds located in the applicants farm within 30 days of the grant of the order.\n\nIt is this order that thechurch wanted the RDCto be held in contempt of.\n\nChirumanzu RDC argued that the order it was allegedto be in contempt of was not served upon it.\n\nThe RDC also said it was not in contemptas itwasactually complying with the court order, having allocated stand number 2861 as ordered, and stand number 4434 in lieu of Stand 2356, to the applicant; erected the fence around the sewer ponds as ordered and settled costs of suit.\n\nChirumanzu RDC also said it wasonly now awaitingthe churchsapplicants compliance with transfer requirements (which include meeting minimum construction requirements) in order to effect transfer, an argument which was accepted by the judge.\n\n",

The rise of this blank, totally vacuous comrado eliteso proximate to the seat of powerspells trouble for Zimbabwe, said Biti.\n\nFormer opposition MP Tendai Biti\n\nTagwirei, through his proxies, has secured lucrative government contracts, including a multimillion-dollar deal to construct the Mbudzi Interchange flyover.\n\nHis business empire has expanded into mining, and he holds a near-monopoly in Zimbabwes fuel sector.\n\nAdditionally, he oversees the controversial Command Agriculture programme and chairs the Land Tenure Implementation Committee.\n\nHis company, Sakunda Holdings, was implicated in the misappropriation of $3 billion from the Ministry of Agriculture between 2017 and 2018.\n\nThe United States of America sanctioned Tagwirei for allegedly enabling corruption among senior government officials.\n\nThough Tagwirei has remained silent, his name continues to circulate as a potential successor to Mnangagwa amid ZANU-PFs internal factional battles.\n\nBiti further argued that the decline of liberation-era war veterans has created a vacuum, allowing opportunistic figures like Tagwireiderisively termed zvigananda (parasites)to exploit their proximity to power for political gain:\n\nThe vacuum left by the departure of the liberation generation is being filled by parasitic comrades with no social base, no shame, and no restraintindividuals who conflate themselves with the state.

We will not witness a situation where the developer will be allocated a wetland as a piece of land for this program, it is not happening and we are the Ministry responsible for ensuring that the urban councils act is being respected by anyone including ourselves.\n\nSo there is no way you will find people coming to demolish these houses that the war veterans were building on properly planned survey and governed settlements it will not happen, dont worry about that.\n\n",

The marriage now subsists only in name, court papers further show.\n\nMachaya, despite the service, elected to remain absent and therefore offered no apology or mitigation.\n\nThematter was set down on the unopposed roll afterherplea was struck out for non-attendance at the pre-trial conference and her subsequent application for rescission was deemed abandoned.\n\nLiabilitywas therefore not in issueand the courtwas onlyseized with the assessment of quantum under r 25(1) of the High Court Rules, 2021.\n\nWhile handing down his judgement, Justice Mambara said that when fixing adultery damages, the court considers the nature and duration of the marriage, knowledge of the marriage by the adulterer, character and social-economic standing of the parties and the extent of contumelia and loss of consortium proved.\n\nThe judge also looked into contrition (or lack thereof) by the adulterer, the need for deterrence, and the level of awards in comparable cases.\n\nMambara said there is no reported High Court decision afterthat ofTaoneyivs Madzima (HH 18-25)has exceeded the composite figure of US$20,000.\n\nInflation-adjusted though that award is, it remains the highest recent comparable award placed before the court, he said.\n\nThe judge said the plaintiff had along, otherwise stable marriage.\n\nHe said there was a total lack of contrition by Machaya, adding that such offenders deserve deterrent penalties.\n\nThe court is satisfied that an award modestly above the most recent ceiling of US $20,000 is justified to reflect both changing economic realities and the egregious facts of this case.\n\nAccordingly, it is ordered that the defendant shall pay to the plaintiff the sum of US $25,000 made up as follows:(a) Contumelia: US$16,000 (b) Loss of consortium: US$9,000.\n\nHe ruled that interest shall run on the above amount at the prescribed rate of 5 % per annum from the date of this judgment to the date of full and final payment.\n\nMachaya will also pay Dhudhlas costs of suit.\n\n",
