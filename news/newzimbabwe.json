The bank said the portion of transactions carried out using the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency surged to 43% in May from 26% in April 2024, the month it was introduced.\n\nDecades of economic instability and currency devaluations mean most people still use the United States Dollar for most purchases. But the authorities are hoping the ZiGs gold backing will give Zimbabweans the confidence to adopt it for everyday transactions.\n\nZiG is our national currency, and as the central bank, we are committed to ensuring its success by maintaining all the fundamental characteristics of sound money, including its function as a reliable store of value, Reserve Bank Governor John Mushayavanhu wrote in response to Reuters questions.\n\nThe Reserve Bank has learned from previous currency failures that maintaining optimum money supply and ensuring monetary stability is vital, he added.\n\nDespite the banks assurances, the gap between the official exchange rate and parallel market rate remains about 20%.\n\nThe rate has been stable for more than three months, said Black-Market Trader Pearson Tambudze, attributing the stability to a scarcity of the local currency rather than restored confidence.There isnt a lot of ZiG in the market, he said.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has welcomed the ZiGs stability but is urging Zimbabwe to adopt tighter money-growth limits, a more transparent foreign exchange market and to make progress on clearing an estimated $12.2 billion in external arrears.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) says adequate stocks of ZWG notes are available to meet the current trade demands across the key economic sectors.\n\nThe announcements come at a time when the majority of citizens outside the capital of Harare have never felt the texture of the ZWG notes. In provinces such as Bulawayo and the Midlands, up to Beitbridge, traders have resorted to the use of US$ and the South African Rand as change due to the scarcity of ZWG notes.\n\nEven in Harare, citizens continue to struggle to access the local unit in hard cash for transactional purposes. As a result, the ZWG accessibility problems, which characterised the local unit since its launch on April 5 2024 have persisted for more than a year, prompting analysts to blame such a tight grip for the eroding confidence in the currency.\n\nIn a recent statement, RBZ governor Dr John Mushayavanhu said he had noted concerns coming from the transacting public relating to the availability of ZWG cash and its usage, particularly from areas outside Harare.\n\nThe RBZ wishes to advise that usage of the local currency, ZWG, has improved significantly in the economy. Precisely, the proportion of local currency settlements on the National Payment System from ZWG7,86 billion in April 2024 to ZWG56,8 billion (43%) as at May 30 2025. In tandem, the Reserve Bank has been disbursing adequate cash to banks in line with demand.\n\nAs at June 12 2025, the total ZWG deposits in the economy amounted to about ZWG16 billion, of which over ZWG207 million was cash held by banks, which meets optimal requirements and is sufficient to support daily deposits and withdrawals by the public, he said.\n\nMushayavanhu said the central bank is currently working with banking institutions to ensure the wider availability and distribution of ZWG cash through banking halls and Automated Teller Machines (ATMs).\n\nThe prevailing currency and exchange rate stability , coupled with measures being taken by the government to increase the usage of ZWG in the economy is expected to result in increased usage of the local currency in both electronic and physical form, he added.\n\n",

The visits follow public outcry over the dysfunctional state of public hospitals.\n\nMnangagwas government has long neglected general hospitals, which now face crumbling infrastructure, medicine shortages, costly patient care and poor wages that have led to low staff morale and a massive brain drain.\n\nOur role as Presidential staffers was to note areas requiring immediate, medium and long-term interventions, and they were just too many, in order to help shape effective health delivery policy.\n\nIt was clear from the visit that the whole health delivery hierarchy needed attention. Failures at basic primary levels like clinics, municipal clinics and district hospitals transmitted themselves all the way to referral hospitals, leading to a system which is creaking from an overload, disrepair and fresh investments.\n\nInterventions have got to be systemic, a lack which in fact explains the rise of top-notch private care-givers who are a ringing antipode to massive failures in the public health system, Charamba wrote on his X account.\n\nZimbabwes referral hospitals are overloaded and overwhelmed, as most primary care clinics are incapacitated and unable to handle even basic health issues.\n\nThe presidential spokesmanalso said Mnangagwa witnessed the Parirenyatwa Hospitals Mbuya NehandaMaternity Wing operating without curtains or heating, compromising patient privacy and comfort.\n\nMany wards do not have enough blankets, and most have broken windows.\n\nCharamba added thatthere are serious administrative inefficiencies across the Ministries of Finance, Local Government, and Health that urgently require a more hands-on approach.\n\n",

Harare City Council is number one, and Bulawayo City Council is number two going forward.\n\nI do not know yet, but we have made the recommendation that we need to have a thorough investigation of all our urban local authorities because there is a lot of decay, said Garwe.\n\nDuring the hearings, which were conducted over a period of nine months, the Jacob Mafume-led council was exposed for its extravagance, with officials taking home hefty perks.\n\nThis is despite the council bemoaning a shortage of funds in its operations, which has seen it failing to provide basics to residents.\n\nA clean-up is expected to be conducted at Town House once President Mnangagwa has reviewed the report and its recommendations.\n\nWith the findings remaining confidential for now, Garwe said his ministry now awaits further instructions from President Mnangagwa.\n\nThey have finished the report. The chairman and myself, as the Minister of Local Government, have come to present the report.\n\nThe details of the report cannot be disclosed today because the President has to go through the report, sit down, finalise it, and give us the way forward, he said.\n\n",

This innovative system utilises advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and big data analytics to enhance traffic flow, road safety, and transparency, said Muswere.\n\nZimbabwe has lagged behind in addressing traffic violations, with offenders often escaping punishment due to an archaic ticketing system.\n\nHowever, given Zimbabwes ongoing power and internet challenges, there is scepticism over the feasibility of the systems success in the country.\n\nMuswere added that the system would be implemented in phases, starting with Harare and Bulawayo.\n\nThe Home-Grown Traffic Management System will be rolled out in phases, commencing with Harare and Bulawayo, followed by other major towns. To support effective implementation, several key enablers will be monitored, including a robust project governance framework, reliable power sources, stable internet connectivity, and strategic system integration with supporting platforms and institutions.\n\nSpecialised courts will assist in expediting justice delivery as the system operates. This localised approach is expected to foster knowledge transfer, skills development, and national pride while promoting self-reliance and sustainability, he said.\n\n",
