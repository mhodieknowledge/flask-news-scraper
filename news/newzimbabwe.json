            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\n1 July remains etched in the hearts of millions of Zimbabweans, 26 years after the passing of Father Zimbabwe and former Vice President Dr Joshua Nkomo. His legacy transcends political divides as the nation unites to honour a man who fought for liberation, only to discover that even freedom did not free his people from the chains of colonialism.\n\nNkomos popularity soared both before and after independence. In the darkest days of the 1980s, he fled the country when then Prime Minister Robert Mugabe deployed North Korean-trained troops known as the Fifth Brigade into parts of Midlands and Matabeleland provinces, killing about 20 000 Ndebele-speaking people and ZAPU supporters.\n\nUnder the pretext of quelling renegades, these forces committed gross atrocities against those seen as aligned with Nkomo. Nkomos statue, erected in Bulawayo, a bronze likeness by North Koreas Mansudae Art Studio, stands at the intersection of Joshua Nkomo Street and 8th Avenue, a testament to his enduring influence.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who oversaw those very operations as state security minister then, described Dr Nkomo as a liberator and champion of Pan-Africanism.\n\nMnangagwa praised Nkomo affectionately known as Chibwe Chitedza for enduring imprisonment in places like Gonakudzingwa and for never compromising his spirit.\n\nChibwe Chitedza as Dr Nkomo came to be popularly known, endured imprisonment in notorious camps such as Gonakudzingwa, but the colonial efforts failed to break his spirit. Today, twenty-six years later, Zimbabwe can look back with pride to the life of a liberator, an astute politician, a champion of Pan-Africanism, he said.\n\nMnangagwa lauded Nkomo as a beacon of peace and unity, invoking his commitment to reconciliation and national cohesion.\n\nUmdala wethu and his generation of impeccable revolutionaries always preached peace as the bedrock of nation building. We are using the peace dividend to implement pro-people oriented policies and high impact programmes and projects in our endeavour to deliver decent livelihoods to all citizens in a free democratic Zimbabweans.\n\nZanu-PF politburo member Tendai Chirau echoed this sentiment, acknowledging Nkomos role in the liberation struggle and describing him as a selfless statesman, whose vision remains a benchmark of leadership today.\n\nA visionary who began the fight against colonialism in his youth, Cde Nkomo was a true statesman whose leadership left indelible marks on history. Though he is no longer with us, his legacy endures as a timeless template of selfless leadership, Chirau wrote on his X account on Tuesday.\n\nYet, not all are convinced of Mnangagwas sincerity. Prince Dubekos Sibanda, former MP for Binga North, dismissed the commemoration as hollow.\n\nYour commemoration isnt sincere. You hated him to the bone, he wrote on X.\n\nOther critics described the tribute as crocodile tears, accusing Mnangagwa of hypocrisy in light of past violence against Nkomos supporters.\n\nOne X handle by Mr Matebele wrote: Emmerson and Robert Mugabe tormented this man, funny how today you are remembering him after killing his commanders and people of Matebelelandwhat a disgrace.\n\nOpposition voices, including Gift Ostalos Siziba, former MP for Tshabalala, lauded Nkomo as a revolutionary icon with extraordinary character and unwavering discipline and recalled his enduring words: Zimbabwe will not die, its young people will save it. These, he said, continue to inspire future leaders.\n\nDr Joshua Nkomo was born on 19 June 1917 in Matopo, a coalition builder who co-founded the National Democratic Party in 1960 and later ZAPU.\n\nAfter being jailed by the Rhodesian government in 1964, he returned to lead resistance efforts.\n\nNkomos life remains a symbol of unity and resilience. Zanu PF, in its last annual conference in Bulawayo last year, passed a resolution to pronounce July 1, each year, a public holiday, but it has not been sanctioned by Mnangagwa himself.\n\nDr Nkomo died on 1 July 1999 at Parirenyatwa Hospital in Harare and was interred at the National Heroes Acre in Harare. He was 82.\n\n",

            "content": "As the rise of neobanks and digital-first services reshapes the financial landscape, traditional institutions are under pressure to modernize. But while face-to-face identity checks are straightforward, doing the same online is far more complex. How can businesses verify identities remotely, securely, and efficiently?\n\nThe answer lies in eKYCshort for electronic Know Your Customer. This digital approach to verifying customer identity is now a cornerstone of modern financial services, enabling fast, secure, and scalable customer onboarding.\n\neKYCis the digital counterpart of traditional KYC procedures. It allows companies to verify identities without requiring physical presence or paper-based documentation. By using biometric data, document scanning, and real-time analytics, eKYC systems authenticate users remotely, ensuring compliance and security while streamlining the user experience.\n\nWhile both eKYC and traditional KYC aim to prevent financial crime such as money laundering and terrorism financing, the key difference lies in how they operate. Traditional KYC relies on physical documents and in-person checks, whereaseKYC solutionsare fully automated, using facial recognition, liveness detection, and AI to validate identities.\n\nAdopted globally, eKYC technology has become especially prominent since 2022. Regulatory bodies, such as the Qatar Central Bank, have already established frameworks for eKYC verification, including allowing non-residents to onboard digitally with official approval.\n\nThe debate of eKYC vs KYC is really about automation and scale. Heres how they differ:\n\nAspect\n\nTraditional KYC\n\neKYC\n\nDocument Submission\n\nIn-person, physical documents\n\nOnline upload, real-time capture\n\nVerification Method\n\nManual inspection\n\nAutomated checks with AI and biometrics\n\nSpeed\n\nDays\n\nSeconds\n\nAccessibility\n\nLimited to branch hours\n\n24/7 global access\n\nCost\n\nHigh operational costs\n\nLower due to automation\n\nUltimately, eKYC solutions provide a faster, more efficient route to customer identity verificationespecially for remote and mobile-first environments.\n\nLets break down how a typical eKYC verification workflow works:\n\nIn a well-optimized flow, all these steps occur in secondsthanks to automated eKYC verification and seamless eKYC processes.\n\nAdopting eKYC technology offers organizations numerous advantages:\n\nThere are multiple eKYC types, depending on the channel and depth of verification:\n\nEach type offers a different balance of user convenience, speed, and regulatory compliance.\n\neKYC verification is being rapidly adopted across various sectors:\n\nExample: N26, a German neobank, uses automated eKYC solutions to autofill user data after scanning a document, expediting form completion.\n\nExample: Binance restricts unverified users to withdrawals only. Kraken mandates full eKYC verification to trade.\n\nAcross these industries, eKYC technology ensures security, compliance, and a frictionless customer experience.\n\nAs AI-generated photos and videos become more convincing, electronic Know Your Customer systems face rising fraud risks. A Regula study found over half of firms in Crypto and FinTech had encountered AI-driven spoofing.\n\nRegulations vary by region. For example, the Qatar Central Bank now mandates active liveness detectione.g., head movementson mobile apps and kiosks.\n\nRobust eKYC systems require high-performance servers, secure APIs, and advanced IDV tools. Companies must balance security with usability.\n\nFraudsters may exploit customer eKYC by mimicking reverification requests. Customers who recently completed verification are more likely to fall for scams.\n\nSolution: Launch fraud awareness hubs like Danske Banks support portal to educate users.\n\nThe shift toward digital banking and identity services makes eKYC more important than ever. With eKYC verification now a regulatory expectation in many countries, businesses that adopt this approach early will gain a competitive edge.\n\nWhether youre launching a neobank, enhancing a FinTech app, or optimizing compliance in crypto, investing in eKYC technology ensures secure and seamless customer onboarding. And as digital identity wallets and verifiable credentials evolve under initiatives like the EUs eIDAS update, eKYC solutions will only grow more robust and reusable.\n\nNow is the time to modernize your identity verification strategy. With partners like Regula, you can deploy advanced document verification, facial recognition, and liveness detection toolsready to support your transformation into the future of secure digital finance.\n\n",
