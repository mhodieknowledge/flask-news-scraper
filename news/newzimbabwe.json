            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFormer Finance Minister Tendai Biti has launched a stinging attack on controversial business tycoon Kudakwashe Tagwirei, accusing him of looting and collapsing Zimbabwes economy.\n\nBiti insists that Tagwireimust be prevented from ascending to the countrys top job, citing his role in destroying Zimbabwes local currency in 2019 as just one example of his economic sabotage.\n\nThe beleaguered businessman was recently ousted from a Zanu-PF Central Committee meeting after his co-option into the partys key structure was foiled. Party spokesman Christopher Mutsvangwa later vowed to fight Tagwireis rise into the partys most senior and influential ranks.\n\nBiti, echoing Mutsvangwas sentiments that Tagwirei is buying his way up the party structure, was blunt about the need to thwart Tagwireis presidential ambitions.\n\nBiti accused Tagwirei of single-handedly collapsing Zimbabwes local currency in 2019 after being issued treasury bills worth US$360 million.\n\nHe alleges Tagwirei then flooded the market with this cash, causing the RTGS currency to plummet. This, Biti argues, is a prime example of how Tagwirei has undermined the nations financial stability through illicit means.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa had once described the local currency as the strongest in the region, although his government later devalued it and announced the introduction of the ZiG currency last April.\n\nTagwirei, who owns numerous companies, some under his well-known Sakunda Holdings, is also accused of netting millions of dollars through his Fossil company, which constructed the Trabablas Interchange in Harare at US$114 million, more than double the regional market prices.\n\nSpeaking to a local online news publication (263Chat) on Monday, Biti took a swipe at Tagwirei, branding him a criminal and unfit to become Zimbabwes President in future.\n\nIt is crazy to think that this criminal actually has ambitions to be the next President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Biti said.\n\nIt cant happen and should not happen. It should not be allowed to happen, he added.\n\nBiti also challenged Zanu-PF, calling it a laughing stock for allowing its values to be disregarded due to greed for money and top-of-the-range vehicles.\n\nI feel pity for Zanu-PF. Zanu-PF is being reduced to a commodity that can be bought by a few trinkets. A few motor vehicles, a few GD6s, what kind of country have we become? Biti queried.\n\nThis comes after Tagwirei himself doled out some top-of-the-range vehicles to Zanu-PFs Harare Provincial leadership in his bid to be co-opted into the partys Central Committee, a move that has come crashing down like a deck of cards.\n\nBiti said thousands of liberation struggle war heroes are turning in their graves, believing they would not have gone to war had they known the current state of Zanu-PF, which people with money are hijacking.\n\n",

Chakulinga also allegedly said Mubaiwa had told her that she had the facility to get money from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe for funding the business, Muchengwa said.\n\nChakulinga allegedly offered assistance with a place to open a business at her premises.\n\nShe was then asked to do proforma invoices in the name of Tanor Investment for the supply of event hosting accessories, tents for R203 308 and the invoices had Mubaiwas Falcon Suppliers FNB bank accounts.\n\nCourt papers show that in December 2018, R203,308 was deposited into the account from CBZ and according to the narration, it was intended for the purchase of tents.\n\nAccording to Chakulinga, upon receipt in her account the funds, Mubaiwa instructed her to divert the funds towards purchase of Range Rover at Menlyn in Pretoria, reads court papers.\n\nChakulinga states that she paid R4 million to Range Rover Menlyn and she was told by Mubaiwa that the motor vehicle was to be taken to Zimbabwe but to her surprise, it was registered in South Africa under Marry Mubaiwa.\n\nIn May, according to Chakulinga, another R2 million was deposited into Bonnette Electrical FNB account and she was called by the bank to confirm the receipt of the funds.\n\nShe did what she had been instructed to do before but this time on the invoices indicated she was to buy electrical prepaid meters.\n\nChakulinga added that after the release of the funds, Mubaiwa ordered her to transfer R4 96 500 to the Martin Potgieter Trust Account at Standard Bank.\n\nAccording to Muchengwa, there was a financial flow from CBZ to FNB that was detected on the accounts.\n\nIt was established that one of the signatories at Mubaiwas East Town Commodities was Jeffery Jenje and he allegedly confirmed this.\n\nJenje also confirmed payments that were made and also that Mubaiwa indeed purchased two vehicles.\n\nProof of vehicle purchase was provided by Jacobus Hercules Du Preez.\n\nDu Preez said Mubaiwa bought two vehicles worth R1,6 million and R1,8 million, respectively.\n\nThe ongoing investigations also revealed that Mubaiwa bought a house by sourcing cash from individual companies to purchase on her behalf.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nZimbabwean beverage giant, Delta Corporation, is experiencing contrasting fortunes in its regional markets after it battled labour disruptions in South Africa and recorded brisk business for its lager beer volumes back home, driven by tobacco sales and resurgent gold prices.\n\nIn South Africa, Deltas subsidiaryUnited National Breweriesvolumes fell by 8% in the quarter to the end of June.\n\nDeltas company secretary, Faith Musinga, said United National Breweries witnessed someunfortunate disruptions from labour unions andpressure groupsin South Africaduring the quarterunder review.However, she said this has now been resolved.\n\nIn contrast, Delta said it has been experiencing significant changes to market channelsarising from the informal sector growth,operational pressures in formal retail sectors as well as varied application of route-to-marketregulations in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe company also had to operate against the currency exchangerate related price distortions and challenges facing the formal retail channelsin Zimbabwe.\n\nNonetheless, signs of strong consumer spending driven by what the company described as stability in the local currency exchange rate, a record-breaking tobacco marketing season and increased gold mining activity helped drive up volumes in Zimbabwe.\n\nDiaspora remittances are benefiting fromthe firming cross exchange rates such as the randand pound, our key source markets. The pricingdistortions arising from exchange rate disparitieshave moderated following the promulgation ofrevised exchange controls on pricing, said Musinga.\n\nThis had seen lager beer volumes in Zimbabwe grow by 19% over the previous contrasting quarter. More so, demand has remained strong, benefiting from the increase in consumer incomes and stable pricing.\n\nIn the soft drinks category, where the company has been facing intense competition from the local Pepsi bottler, Delta volumes remained subdued over the quarter to end June. It also blamed the recently imposed high sugar content surtax, saying it was impacting on price competitiveness.\n\nThe surtax had also resulted in theinflux ofsimilar products imported from the region where the sugar tax does not apply. Smuggling is also adding to the woes for Delta.\n\nA total of $4.5 million in sugar tax was paid during the quarter. The prevailing sugartax structure continues to place unsustainable pressure on the viability of the category, said the company.\n\nDespite these challenges, Delta raised overall revenues for the quarter by 25%, mainly as a result ofvolumegrowth in the alcoholic beverage businesses inZimbabwe, helping to offsetthe pricemoderation in the sparkling beverages business.\n\nAbout 85% of Deltas sales volumes were undertaken in US dollar, said the company.\n\nIn a recent securities and advisory research note on Zimbabwes consumer sector, analysts at IH Securities saidthey anticipate an uplift to volumes for consumer-facing companies this year owing to a likely recovery in consumer spend.\n\nHowever, this was against the backdrop of general cost structures continuing to be on the rise corresponding to a volatile policy environment and the crystallization of costs in US dollars.\n\nOn the demand side, private consumption growth,which had slowed down from 4.8% in 2023 to 2.5% in 2024, is expected to have a rosier year with household spending rebounding by 6.6% in 2025, said the report.\n\nZimbabwean consumer discretionary spend, however, remains subdued, with data from Zimstats recently showing average earnings of 55% of the employed population earning less than $100.\n\nWorse still, job losses within the past 3 months emanated mainly those engaged in agriculture and domestic activities, whilst IT and Electricity sectors had the lowest job losses.\n\n",

            "content": "By Gift Msipa | Radio France Int\n\nThe current situation is that we have 57 percent of all mental health institutions admissions being attributed to drug use, says Wilson Box, head of theZimbabwe Civil Liberties and Drug Network an organisation working in eight of the countrys 10 provinces to raise awareness about the dangers of drug abuse.\n\nIn our communities you find that for every four houses, in one house there is drug peddling. Among these we also have new sedative substances in the form of illicit brews that are very potent and nobody really knows the content of these illicit brews.\n\nBox adds that the problem shows no sign of slowing down.\n\nMany young people in the country say they turn to drugs because of personal difficulties, including unemployment and poverty.\n\nTawanda Murepa, who leads theYoung People Mental Health TrustinHarare, says that stigma remains a major issue, as it prevents young people from speaking openly about their problems and seeking help.\n\nHe believes the best approach is to show them the dangers of drug use, but with care and understanding\n\nTurning away once you have started will differ from person to person depending on a number of factors, such as the resilience of the person as based on their mindset, their genetics, the period of usage of the drug, he said.\n\nDespite major strides, Zimbabwe faces battle to end HIV for all\n\nThe amount and quality and quantity of drug as well as the damage caused and so on, all determine the level of dependency. So we say it is not good to start on drugs at all. We should just talk about how people should not start on drugs whatever problems they have in life.\n\nTawanda also says that rehabilitation should be the final option for treatment. Once a person reaches that stage, the process can go either way  they may succeed or suffer a relapse.\n\nHowever, there are success stories.\n\nGivas Chirinda is 26. He started using drugs in 2011 but has not used any substances for the past three years. Today, he helps other young people in Harare understand the risks ofdrug abuse. He encourages those already involved to stop, because, as he says, he knows it is possible.\n\nYou do not need to use threats or frightening language, he said. Approach those who are using drugs by acknowledging the problem. If one used 10 stars [a drug measure] for example, talk to them and say OK, why not try and reduce to nine and lets see what happens and go down to. say, six and see what happens\n\nHe believes the root cause behind drug use must also be addressed to prevent relapse.\n\nMost young people get into drugs due to idleness and unemployment, he said. So if at all possible it is a good idea that young people are assisted to become engaged in self-help projects such as chicken rearing and goat keeping and so on This would go a long way [towards] keeping them away from drugs, and give them a sense of purpose.\n\nSister Hendrina Chitsama is a medical professional working in drug rehabilitation. She explains that many drug users try to quit on their own, without going through detox or proper treatment.\n\nDetoxification is incredibly important and its more than just a medical procedure  it is a psychological and emotional reset, she said.\n\nAfter someone turns away from drugs, their body still carries an imprint of addiction. Detoxification helps cleanse the system but more crucially it opens the door to real healing. You cannot build a new foundation on a toxic residue. That is why detoxification is the starting line, not the finish line.\n\nWith the drug problem worsening, Zimbabwean PresidentEmmerson Mnangagwathis month launched a campaign to raise more than USD $77 million to fight drug and substance abuse.\n\nThis follows the creation of a committee of officials to lead the response. The plan also includes identifying more than 60 centres across the country to support rehabilitation efforts.\n\nStakeholders believe this campaign could make a real difference  if implemented well.\n\nThey have stressed the need inZimbabweto strengthen law enforcement in order to break drug supply chains.\n\nOther measures being called for are improvedrehab facilities  and to stop the practice of treating drug users alongsidemental health patients  as well as tackling the stigma around addiction, training morehealth professionals in addiction management and the provision ofdetoxification medication.\n\n",

A formal board of inquiry has been initiated, said Tshabalala.\n\nTshabalala said Raynards next of kin, from Kimberley, Northern Cape, have been formally notified, and psychosocial support is being provided to the family and his unit members.\n\nOperation Corona is a national border safeguarding initiative aimed at combating transnational crimes along the countrys borders.\n\nTshabalala said that soldiers deployed in these operations face harsh terrain, isolation and exposure to unpredictable natural conditions.\n\nLauren Liebenberg from the Vhembe Biosphere Reserve said:At this time of year, the crisis with the elephant populations that roam the Limpopo River Valley intensifies.When elephant hunting starts in the dry season they come across the Limpopo River [into SA] in huge numbers, she said, adding that the elephants neededa well-managed migration corridor.\n\nThe problem extends along the whole length of the 200km strip between Mapungubwe and Kruger National Park. We become a massive human-wildlife conflict zone.\n\nLiebenberg said a programme by the US Agency for International Development to manage the problem collapsed after the US administration cancelled it earlier this year.\n\nThrough the programme, they trained elephant herders and provided all sorts of defence interventions.\n\nDeaths still remain rare and at the extreme end of the human wildlife conflict interface, but the elephants do massive damage to crops, to infrastructure  especially fencing and water infrastructure, and to the natural vegetation in the nature reserves, said Liebenberg.\n\n",

Those ranged from attempting to repay its debts using the proceeds of metal sales and recently approaching 10 nations for help to raise $2.6 billion to pay its arrears.\n\nAjay Banga. Image: Bloomberg\n\nTrying to figure it out on your own, youll be doing this for the next five years, Banga said in an interview in Maputo, Mozambiques capital. They need to figure out a way to reach out to the G20 and say, we raise our hand, wed like to be part of this process.\n\nZimbabwe first defaulted on repayments to the World Bank in 2000. Its debts to a host of multilateral institutions and bilateral lenders mounted amid a failed land-reform program and a quarter century of economic turmoil, shutting it out of international debt markets and limiting its ability to borrow even during the global pandemic and a recent devastating drought.\n\nThe government has asked the African Development Bank to advise on clearing its debt with the institutions outgoing president, Akinwumi Adesina, and former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano asked to negotiate with creditors. It also hired Global Sovereign Advisory, a Paris-based consultancy, to help. The fact that Zimbabwean officials, including President Emmerson Mnangagwa, have been sanctioned by the US has complicated the process.\n\nWhile Belarus, Syria and Eritrea are also in arrears to the World Bank, Zimbabwes default is by far the longest. South Africa, which currently holds the G-20 presidency, last month said it has been approached by Zimbabwe to try and garner the groups support for a debt workout.\n\nZambia, Ghana and Ethiopia are among nations that have employed the G20s Common Framework, which was created in 2020 to help poor nations bring together a diverse set of creditors to restructure debts. While they have made progress in reaching deals, the process has been criticized for being too slow.\n\nZimbabwe isnt technically poor enough to be eligible to utilise the framework, yet Sri Lanka  a nation in a similar situation  approached the group in 2023 for help with dealing with its creditors.\n\nStart talking to the G20 and the Paris Club and whoever else has given them money and we can help, Banga said. We try and bring an understanding of what write down you need to take. It takes a while.\n\nZimbabwes Treasury didnt respond to a request for comment.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nKidnappers in Nigeria have killed at least 35 people they abducted from a village in northern Zamfara state despite ransoms being paid for their release, a local official told the BBC.\n\nIn recent years, criminal gangs in the region, known in the country as bandits, have taken to kidnapping people as a means to raise money.\n\nIn this incident, 56 people were taken from Banga village, Kauran Namoda local government area in March. The gunmen then demanded a ransom of one million naira ($655; 485) per captive, media in Nigeria report.\n\nLocal government chairman Manniru Haidara Kaura said that most of those killed were young people who were slaughtered like rams.\n\nWhat happened was that the bandits demanded ransom money, and after some back-and-forth, they were given what they asked for. They then released 18 people, including 17 women and one young boy, on Saturday, Haidara added.\n\nOnly they [the gunmen] know why they killed them. They are senseless and heartless people. They forget that they are killing their own brothers, and we will all meet before Allah.\n\nSixteen of those released on Saturday are in the hospital receiving treatment, while the bodies of the 38 killed by the bandits are unlikely to be returned as in these cases corpses are rarely released.\n\nIn an attempt to curb the spiralling and lucrative kidnapping industry, a law was enacted in 2022 making it a crime to make ransom payments. It carries a jail sentence of at least 15 years, however no-one has ever been arrested on those charges.\n\nIt also made abduction punishable by death in cases where victims die.\n\nBut families often feel forced to pay to save their loved ones, citing the governments inability to ensure their safety.\n\n",
