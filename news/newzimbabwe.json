Since 2010, Zimbabwe has managed only two wins in 29 World Cup Qualifier fixtures.\n\n",

This time its a bit more fun because Im playing tennis. Next week Ill start weight training. The comments at the weekend were harsh. It hurt my feelings a bit but sometimes thats what you need, a little push, he said.\n\nIt is a projection, about how you feel about yourself. Body shaming and all of that. You dont know what Im going through. Im going to turn the lemons into lemonade.\n\nThis is not the first time Cassper has undergone a weight loss journey before his Fill Up concerts.\n\nIn 2022 Cassper did it before his Fill Up Mmabatho concert in Mahikeng.\n\nI cant explain how proud I am of myself. This was by far the hardest weight loss journey for me because I have done this three times and I now knew what it would take for me to get back in shape. To be honest, mentally I didnt feel like I was as strong as I once was and I was demoralised.\n\nIts supposed to get easier by the day but it got harder and harder. I just kept waking up and going. Lost touch with a lot of relationships and people because I zoned into this goal and I had no time for anyone but myself.\n\nLooking at these pictures now Im in awe of myself. I owe it to myself never to let myself go like that again. Big shout out to my training and nutrition team. Shout out to Fight Club for always having their doors open for me at any time I wanted to train. We four weeks out Boys! Lets put on a show! Im back!\n\n",

Something must have gone seriously wrong.\n\nOnias argued the property was a donation that could be revoked because Pride had become disrespectful and violent towards him, and had even tried to sell it against his wishes.\n\nBut the court ruled there was never a valid donation. There was never an intention to gratuitously and without obligation give the 1st respondent the property, Justice Muzofa said. There were strings attached. The applicant intended to continue to derive a benefit from the property.\n\nThe judge stressed that while Onias funded the purchase, the house was always registered in Prides name. The evidence before the Court strongly shows that the applicant purchased the property for the 1st respondent and he had strings attached, the judge said.\n\nDismissing the claim with costs, the judge concluded: Revocation can only be made where there is a valid donation.\n\n",
