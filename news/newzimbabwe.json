We are talking of something that is unconstitutional, and the multitudes and the power of Zimbabweans will only lead to endorse what is constitutional. We are not going to be held hostage by a few individuals, said Fambi.\n\nIn its plot to extend Mnangagwas tenure, Zanu PF is hoping to take advantage of the opposition, which is in disarray.\n\nHowever, the bid has ignited factionalism within the ruling party, with one side emerging to resist the plan and back Mnangagwas deputy, Constantino Chiwenga, to succeed him.\n\nSeveral politicians including Tendai Biti have also vowed to fight Zanu PFs tenure extension.\n\nIn a political landscape that has a plethora of opposition parties, NPD deputy leader Kumbirayi Chenhare said they have the wherewithal to challenge Zanu PFs hegemony.\n\nWe are from the people, by the people, so our strength lies in the masses. Therefore, we will be well-funded and accepted, said Chenhare.\n\n",
