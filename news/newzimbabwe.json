            "content": "Medicalbrief\n\nSouth Africa  TheNational Department of Healthhas condemned the action taken by some groups to prevent foreign nationals from accessing essential healthcare services around the country, after campaigners in both Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal blocked clinic and hospital entry to migrant patients, demanding proof of identity before anyone was allowed in.\n\nThis week, members ofOperation Dudulain Gauteng and of theMarch and Marchmovement in KZN began manning the entrances of government facilities that includedAddington HospitalandGateway Clinicin Durban,RK Khan Hospitalin Chatsworth, andHillbrow Clinicas well asRosettenville Clinic,south of Johannesburg, in a bid to prevent alleged undocumented foreigners from seeking health services.\n\nThe Mercuryreports that they accosted patients at the gate and demanded they show ID documents to confirm they were South African nationals.\n\nIn Rosettenville last week, foreign nationals were barred from the local clinic by the protesters who said they were fed up with the long queues that mostly comprised illegal foreign nationals and who, they added, are placing a strain on the facilitys already stretched resources, reportsKaya959.\n\nThey said the clinic was on the brink of collapse, having already stretched its resources to provide free healthcare  mostly to migrants.\n\nClinic management denied allegations that it was turning people away, saying it was attending to everyone walking into the health facility, reportseNCA. Some patients in the queue said they had been waiting for assistance for a week.\n\nPut SA First\n\nDaily Maverickreports that the various anti-migrant groups broadly fall under the Put South Africa First banner  including Operation Dudula, thePatriotic Alliance(PA) and several smaller community groups.\n\nThe groups are demanding that South Africans be prioritised over undocumented migrants  whom they want deported  for economic opportunities and services, like healthcare, accusing them of burdening the countrys health system to the detriment of locals.\n\nThey demanded proof of our nationalities and denied us access because we are not South Africans. The clinic has our clinic cards because we come here for medical attention, said a young mother who was at the Rosettenville Clinic to have her baby vaccinated.\n\nThe Immigration Act stipulates that only immigration officers and members of theSouth African Police Service(SAPS) have the authority to ask citizens and foreign nationals to produce valid documentation.\n\nAt the Hillbrow Community Clinic, where members of the PA, along with a small group of residents and members of Operation Dudula, denied access to foreign nationals, an off-duty security officer toldDaily Maverickthat the (anti-foreigner) groups that have been coming here are not happy with the matron.\n\nThey feel she is siding with the foreign nationals, and when they came on Friday, some demanded to speak to the clinics provincial manager, he said.\n\nAt the Rosettenville Clinic, where community members stood guard at the gates screening patients, Aneliswa Dutshwa, who spoke on behalf of the local anti-migrant group, claimed South African voters concerns were not being taken seriously by the government.\n\nWe want Immigration and Home Affairs to be visible. We are not taking a break until they are both visible, Dutshwa said.\n\nForeign nationals who were barred from entering the facility said they were also being denied a chance to take their clinic cards so they could seek help elsewhere.\n\nSome said they could afford private healthcare, but, pointed out oneZimbabwean who was at the clinic to collect medication, private health facilities require their clinic cards, with their full medical history. Without their cards they could not go anywhere else.\n\nI would have left already because its clear that they will not allow us in, but I want my clinic card because private health facilities require those. If they can give me my card, I will leave, she said.\n\nOperation Dulula\n\nOperation Dudula, which has vowed to intensify its operations at health centres, has been calling for the deportation of all undocumented foreign nationals since its emergence in mid-2020.\n\nThe groups Zandile Dabula said they would escalate their operations and also call for doctors who are foreign nationals to be replaced with South Africans, even if the foreigners were legally employed.\n\nThe government has condemned the groups and said it would deploy police to maintain peace and enforce the law at the affected facilities.\n\nGauteng police spokesperson Brigadier Brenda Muridili said: These deployments are as and when needed, and should the need arise, the SAPS will respond to its mandate.\n\nIllegal\n\nDepartment of Health spokesperson Foster Mohale said the reports were concerning.\n\nWe have noted with concern these illegal actions, he said, adding that no one has the right to prevent anyone from medical treatment.\n\nEveryone who happens to be in the country is protected by a number number of prescripts, including Section 27 of the constitution, theNational Health Act, and theRefugees Actof 1998.\n\nWhile there were claims that those seeking health services are illegal in the country, and while the department condemns the action of those who enter the country illegally, he said, no one has the right to take the law into their own hands.\n\nGauteng Health MEC Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko indicated that her department has begun engaging concerned community-based organisations involved in the campaign, adding that while they noted the concerns by some groups, our Constitution allows everybody to access healthcare services, so it becomes difficult for us to chase people away.\n\nTheSouth African Human Rights Commission(SAHRC) said the rise in complaints from people being turned away from facilities was unlawful, discriminatory, and an infringement on human rights, reportsIOL.\n\nSection 27(1) of the Constitution clearly states that everyone has the right to have access to . services, including reproductive healthcare, it said in a statement.\n\nThe SAHRC has urged health departments and provincial leaders to address critical issues plaguing the sector, like staff shortages, long waiting times, and insufficient bed availability, saying these challenges, compounded by discriminatory practices, exacerbate healthcare inequity in an already strained system.\n\nMeanwhile, theForum for South Africa(FOSA) said the Human Rights Commission is failing in its arguments as it advocates for undocumented migrants to access healthcare services in this country.\n\nThe organisation added that illegal foreign nationals taking advantage of national health services arenot only affecting South Africans, but other legal documented foreign nationals.\n\nThey burden the system while accessing medications earmarked for citizens and documented migrants, said the organisations spokesperson, Tebogo Mashilompane.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nDelta Beverages (Pvt) Ltd has raised concerns over the excessive local sugar pricing and the sugar tax, saying both factors are undermining the companys competitiveness.\n\nAppearing before the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Industry and Commerce on Tuesday, Deltas Finance Director Alex Makamure said the current sugar pricingset at US$900 per metric tonne by Gold Star and US$890 by Tongaat Hulettsis significantly higher than import landed prices.\n\nCurrently, imported sugar is landing at $800/int before adding the 30 surtax. With the added cost of the sugar tax, the impact of the sugar cost is a key determinant of the viability of our business.\n\nThe high cost of sugar is in addition to the recently introduced sugar tax, which is equivalent to another US$100/MT.\n\nAccording to Makamure, prices of sugar-added soft drinks increased by between 15% to 45% following the introduction of the tax in February 2024.\n\nThe highest increases were on cordials such as Mazoe Orange Crush. The process of cordials has been moderated since January 2025 after the surtax was halved to $0.0005/g.\n\nHe said most beverage producers had reported a miscalculated volume performance since February 2024, with most players absorbing the sugar tax by maintaining discounted prices to avoid a volume collapse whilst awaiting the much-needed review of the tax levels by the authorities.\n\nThe duties and surtaxes penalise the manufacturers even when they have no alternative but to access local supplies.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Sugar Association reports that they had in excess of 16,000 tons of carry-over bottler-grade sugar stocks from the 2024 milling season and there will be over 90,000 tons of uncommitted sugar stocks from the 2025 milling season.\n\nMakamure added that the sugar tax further compounds operational challenges, calling for urgent policy reviews to support the local industry.\n\nZimbabwe is a net exporter of sugar and attracts reciprocal tariffs from other countries.\n\nThe main suppliers of refined sugar are StarAfrica (Goldstar Sugars)and Tongaat Hullets (Hippo Valley & Triangle).\n\nAdded Makamure, Over the years, they have failed to meet the quantity and quality requirements.\n\nGiven these challenges, the Industry and Commerce ministry agreed with the bottlers to supplement their requirements from imports.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) finds itself once again locking horns with university authorities, this time demanding the reinstatement of members suspended from state universities.\n\nThe union is accusing three universities, Midlands State University (MSU), Great Zimbabwe University (GZU) and the University of Zimbabwe (UZ) of what it calls a flagrant violation of both domestic and international human rights law.\n\nThe suspended students stand accused of breaching conduct regulations, allegedly brandishing placards on campus and calling for a resolution to the ongoing lecturers strike.\n\nIn a letter dated 7 July 2025, and served to the students on Tuesday, UZ Vice Chancellor Paul Mapufmo stated that the six had contravened rule 3.1.4 of the Rules of Student Conduct and Discipline, 1984 Ordinance 30, by moving around campus inciting fellow students to join the lecturers protests.\n\nIt was brought to my attention that on the 12th of May 2025 at around 1210 hours, while in the company of Blessing Mtisi, Nodeshar Maingehama, Tafadzwa Katsande Masimba, Tawananyasha Hove and Mtukura Tariro were found holding unlawful demonstration at the University Halls of Residence.\n\nYou were moving one hall of residence to another, one dining hall to another, addressing fellow students and inciting them to join you to hold placards and chant slogans against the University Administration.\n\nAccordingly in light of the seriousness of the allegations detailed above, I have found it necessary to, in terms of section 8 (3) (e) of the University of Zimbabwe Act,[ Chapter 25:16], (the act) to suspend you with immediate effect, from your studies at the University of Zimbabwe indefinitely pending disciplinary hearing against you.\n\nIn response, ZINASU President Emmanuel Sitima issued three key demands, asserting that Mapfumos actions reflect a deliberate and systematic effort to criminalise dissent and suppress the agency of students as political and civic actors.\n\nSuch repressive conduct is not only morally indefensible, but legally unsustainable. The Constitution of Zimbabwe (2013), which stands as the supreme law of the Republic, guarantees the freedom of expression (Section 61), freedom of assembly and association (Section 58), and the right to peaceful demonstration and petition (Section 59), said Sitima.\n\nSitima further insisted that the suspended students must be reinstated immediately and without conditions.\n\nThe immediate and unconditional reinstatement of all students unlawfully suspended or expelled. A thorough and independent investigation into the abuse of university disciplinary procedures for political ends. Firm guarantees from the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education affirming the protection of student rights in accordance with the Constitution, he declared.\n\nThe dispute comes as UZ lecturers have been on strike since April, demanding fair wages. At one point, even President Emmerson Mnangagwas spokesman, George Charamba, conceded that the US$230 being offered to lecturers at UZ was a concern, pledging that his boss had approved salary increments.\n\nThe university has responded to the industrial action by suspending protesting lecturers and replacing them with what students are derisively calling virgins in the academic setting, ill-equipped to handle the demands of the job.\n\n",
