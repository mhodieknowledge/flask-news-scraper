            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nLEADING hospitality concern Rainbow Tourism Group (RTG) has shelled out heavy debt, creating flexible room to table an aggressive expansion drive within and outside the countrys borders.\n\nSpeaking to NewZimbabwe.com on the sidelines of an event to share the groups performance for the year ended December 31 2024, RTGs CEO Tendai Madziwanyika said the debt repayment commitment has managed to ease the companys gearing from an exorbitant ratio of 70% when he took over in 2012 to the current debt free position.\n\nIn the last six years from 2019, which was just before Covid-19 we spent about US$42 million on capital projects and loan servicing, which was split into repayment and interests. Our loan repayment during that period was about US$17 million and interest payments were about US$2,4 million, making it to a total loan servicing of US$19,5 million right from Covid-19 era to now, he said.\n\nThe RTG boss, who is widely acclaimed for taking the hospitality concern out of the woods, revealed that over the years, the group has spent US$22,6 million, out of which US$11,8 million went towards refurbishment and US$10,8 million basic care and maintenance.\n\nWhen we started, our gearing was about 70%. Today, we are almost debt free. In 2020, we managed to pay back the last part of our loans. It was a debenture of US$16,7 million and this was actually paid to our shareholder NSSA. The amount was in full and final settlement in 2020 during Covid-19, he said.\n\nResultantly, the group has tabled an aggressive expansion plan on the back of revelations that the acquisition of Montclair Hotel is now in the final stages, with a whopping US$1 million budget having already been set aside for refurbishment.\n\nThe group is yet to unveil finer details on another project in South Africa on the back of plans to expand its footprint with the Harare.\n\nThe just-ended reporting year ended December 31 2024, saw the group delivering strong performance driven by 4% growth in occupancy and a 15% rise in foreign currency revenues.\n\nI would like to highlight that in the revenue of US$ 44,3 million, about US$19 million is the actual foreign currency. That number last year was US$16,4 million and a year before that, we were excited as we were at US$11,1 million.\n\nIt shows the capacity of the business to generate foreign currency so that is quite exciting and coming back to 2012 we were at about US$5 million, added Madziwanyika.\n\n",

This gave a sense that the municipality was moving in the right direction.\n\nAlas, it was tantamount to a fig that might appear ripe and juicy on the outside but full of ants inside.\n\nThe Mbare stadium continues to be exposed as Castle Lager Premier Soccer League (PSL) matches are played at the imposing football facility.\n\nOn Saturday, the VIP enclosure was flooded with water as rains pounded down, with a leaking roof offering little respite.\n\nThe embarrassing scenario reflected the stadia crisis the country is grappling with, which has seen Zimbabwean football teams playing outside the country.\n\nRufaro Stadium is far from meeting the international football standards set by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) for hosting matches.\n\nThe stadium does not have a media room, the tunnel to the dressing rooms has not yet been expanded, the pitch lacks a proper drainage system, and an archaic scoreboard is still in use.\n\nDespite all the glaring deficiencies, Harare City Council spokesperson Stanley Gama, in a post on X (formerly Twitter), said Rufaro Stadium is looking good.\n\nRufaro Stadium is hosting mammoth crowds without problems thanx to the City of Harare who renovated the traditional home of football and in the process bringing back top-flight football to Harare. Its still work in progress, and challenges are faced, but Rufaro looking good\n\nToday(Sunday), @capsunitedfczw hosted @ScottlandFC and the stadium was about 90 percent full. It speaks volumes to the great work done at the stadium for it to accommodate such a huge crowd. The City of Harare will keep improving those areas that need attention, wrote Gama.\n\nWhen questioned about the leaking VIP area, Gama drew comparisons with Manchester Uniteds home ground, Old Trafford, whose roof recently leaked.\n\nEven at Old Trafford such things happen. At Rufaro this will all soon be rectified, he said.\n\nThe HCC faces the task of revamping Rufaro Stadium, with failure likely to leave Harare teamsDynamos, Herentals, CAPS United, and Scottlandin limbo should the Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) reinspect and deem the stadium unfit.\n\nThe City Council had promised to complete the installation of bucket seats throughout the stadium, with only a few having been installed in the VIP section. The bucket seats are being supplied by Henrietta Rushwayas company OkimaPlastics.\n\n",

Based on what he has seen, he feels Meghan appears overly rehearsed.\n\nYou have to be authentic to hold peoples attention, he said. Unfortunately, Meghan has never been authentic.

Everything she says is pre-planned and rehearsed.\n\nThe formerHollywoodlighting director also dismissed Meghans claims that she grew up eating TV dinners and fast food, insisting that he provided a comfortable life for her.\n\nWe occasionally ate TV dinners, which family doesnt? But I was working two jobs, so money was never an issue. We would eat out at least three times a week and order in the rest of the time, he said.\n\nHe recalled frequently taking Meghan to high-end restaurants in Hollywood.\n\nThomas also criticised Meghans cooking style in the show, calling her approach impractical for ordinary viewers.\n\nMeghan should make affordable food and show people how to stretch their food budget, he said, pointing out that she frequently uses expensive ingredients like edible flowers and elaborate fruit platters.\n\nI dont think most people these days can afford to go out and spend $90 (R1 644) on fruit. Shes out of touch with normal people, he said.\n\nSending kids off to school with edible flowers on their food is silly. Kids dont like them, and if you put edible flowers in a kids lunchbox, they would probably get teased at school.\n\nDaddy dearest isnt happy or proud of his daughter in her moment.Thomas has been estranged from Meghan since her 2018 wedding to Prince Harry, which he missed due to health issues.\n\nDespite their fallout, he still recalls their last shared meal fondly  a reminder of a relationship that seems far from mending.\n\n",
