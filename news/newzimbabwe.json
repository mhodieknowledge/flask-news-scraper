The fear, as told by one of the officers, is that protestors will take and burn them.\n\nTyres are usually burnt and used to barricade roads during protests as was witnessed in the January 2019 and August 1 demonstrations.\n\nIn the populous Chitungwiza suburb, some bar employees in Zengeza 2 confirmed that they had been told to close shop between 8pm and 9pm in what one operator described as an illegal curfew.\n\nTruckloads of officers deployed to enforce such orders have been spotted numerous times.\n\nMost of the bars have been told to close between 8pm and 9pm in an unsanctioned curfew we do not support, said an imbiber, who requested anonymity.\n\nMnangagwa is battling to avoid a repeat of events he led in 2017 that forced late President Robert Mugabes eventual resignation.\n\nWith the help of war veterans and the military, Mnangagwa convinced millions of Zimbabweans to march and unseat Mugabe in a manner similar to that which Geza is pursuing.\n\nGeza has over the past weeks been laying into Mnangagwa and propping up his deputy Constantino Chiwenga whom he says will deal with corrupt elements that have captured the presidency and government.\n\nHe has named over five local businessmen, all of which he accuses of illegally benefiting from government tenders.\n\nThe same individuals were derogatorily labelled as Zvigananda by Chiwenga.\n\nGeza is wanted by the police but has remained on the run since the arrest of journalist Blessed Mhlanga for interviewing and broadcasting their conversation.\n\nI am being protected by people because I stand for peoples wishes, said the man who was known as Bombshell during Zimbabwes war for liberation.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner atMadzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal)to discussthe laws governing social media use in Zimbabwe.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, this week we want to discuss social medialaws. The Minister of Information,Publicity and Broadcasting Services Dr. Jenfan Muswere at the Minister meet the Media event stated that the government is drafting a new social media legislation to regulate social media. What lawsarecurrently regulating social media?\n\nVM: Thank you. Ifmy memory serves me right, one of the aims of that legislation is to address the issue of ghost accounts. As the legislation has not been introduced yet, I will focus on the current legal position.\n\nTo your question on how social media is currently regulated, we have to start at the constitution level. Our constitution in Zimbabwe guarantees everyones right to propagate and express their opinions and beliefs whether in private or in public, individually or collectively. This right extends to any individuals ability to freely express or disseminate ideas through media, in this particular case, social media.\n\nHaving said that, all rights have qualifications or limitations, otherwise they will end up infringing on the other rights enjoyed by people in a democratic community. The same constitution then limits this right to freely express opinions or ideas by the media if the exercise of such right to express ideas may incite violence or be injurious to another persons reputation or dignity. The requirement in our law for injury to reputation also considers whether there was malice. Going back to the limitations, the constitution also limits the right of expression where it breaches someone elses right to privacy or it amounts to hate speech\n\nReporter: Some people argue that these limitations are wide in interpretation and have been used to infringe on peoples rights by the State, calling it subversive content\n\nVM: The laws governing what you are referring to as subversive content is found mainly in our Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act and our Cyber and Data Protection Act. There have been allegations of abuse of this wide interpretation, it really depends on which side of the table you are sitting and whose argument you are listening to.\n\nSubversive content is, in general terms, material that threatens state authority or incites public disorder. This material can include publishing false statements prejudicial to the state, or transmitting messages that incite violence or damage to property.\n\nThere has been some high-profile cases involving such allegations and some legal critics argue that words like prejudicial are open to selective enforcement. I suppose these are some of the issues that will be clarified by the proposed new social media laws.\n\nReporter:What is the position when it comes to defaming people using social media?\n\nVM: Defamation in terms of our laws has criminal and civil implications.\n\nOur Criminal Law Code still retains an imprisonment option when one publishes false information that is harmful to anothers reputation. The court also considers the issue of malice when the information was published in weighing the appropriate punishment. That is whether or not the motivation for the statement was malicious.\n\nThe injured person being the person who has been defamed can also approach our civil courts with a claim for defamation which can include damages. The defamed person will need to prove that the statement was false, malicious and reckless and has reduced their standing in society.\n\nSeveral cases have been brought in our civil courts with a number being successful after having met the criteria set to qualify for defamation.\n\nReporter: We have seen a number of prosecutions that include the leaking of nudes or sex tapes by exlovers?\n\nVM: There have been a number of cases alleging revenge leaks of nude images or videos of a sexual nature involving exlovers. Our censorship laws prohibit the distribution of indecent material or material regarded as obscene. The qualification here is whether the material distributed offends public morality.\n\nFurther, our Cyber and Data Protection laws criminalize posting or sharing nudes or videos of a sexual nature involving another, which in this example is an ex-lover, without their consent. The penalties from such posts may even include imprisonment.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nThesediscussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE recent passing of Geoff Nyarota, an award-winning veteran journalist and writer, has reopened a painful chapter in Zimbabwes history.\n\nWhile lauded by many as a doyen of journalism, both within the country and internationally, Nyarotas tenure at the helm of the state-funded Chronicle newspaper during the early 1980s, and his perceived handling of the Gukurahundi atrocities, has undeniably left a dark stain on his legacy.\n\nThe central accusation revolves around Nyarotas alleged support for the deployment of the North Korean-trained army the Fifth Brigade in Matabeleland and some parts of Midlands.\n\nThis deployment saw the unit wreak havoc upon the region, carrying out acts of killing, maiming, and rape, overwhelmingly targeting the Ndebele-speaking population, whom they accused of harbouring dissidents and supporting Joshua Mqabuko Nyongolo Nkomo, the founder and leader of the then Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU).\n\nIndependent human rights groups have estimated that approximately 20,000 people lost their lives during the Fifth Brigades presence in Matabeleland and some parts of Midlands, between 1982 and 1987. A period that to this day is considered a genocide by many.\n\nThe then Prime Minister, Robert Mugabe himself described this period as a moment of madness, yet he died without ever issuing an apology or accepting responsibility for the actions carried out under his command.\n\nIn the wake of Nyarotas death, Information Permanent Secretary Nick Mangwana stated that journalism was the poorer for his passing, acknowledging his impact on investigative journalism.\n\nAs a pioneering editor, he left an indelible mark on the countrys journalism landscape. His contributions to investigative journalism and robust public discourse will be remembered, Mangwana wrote on X Sunday.\n\nJob Sikhala, the former St Marys MP and National Democratic Working Group (NDWG) Chairperson, echoed these sentiments: He told it as it is as the then Editor in Chief of the Daily News until they bombed to silence it. Panyika idandaro. Rest in Eternal Peace Geoff Nyarota!!! Sikhala posted on X Sunday.\n\nNumerous other prominent figures in Zimbabwean society have also paid tribute to Nyarotas contribution to journalism, including the renowned lawyer and University of Zimbabwe (UZ) lecturer Professor Lovemore Madhuku, Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) founder and owner Trevor Ncube, and the current Information Minister, Jenfan Muswere, along with a multitude of journalists and commentators.\n\nHowever, the shadow of Gukurahundi continues to loom large, casting a long and troubling pall over Nyarotas professional reputation.\n\nCritics argue that his time at The Chronicle was nothing short of disastrous, alleging that he deliberately chose to ignore the atrocities unfolding in Matabeleland. Furthermore, some claim that he even advocated for the continued deployment of the Fifth Brigade, appealing directly to the late Mugabe to maintain their presence in the region.\n\nIt is often said that one should not speak ill of the dead, but the gravity of the accusations surrounding Nyarotas role during this period necessitate a reckoning with this controversial chapter in his career.\n\nSiphosami Malunga, a globally recognised human rights lawyer and activist, offered a particularly stark assessment of Nyarotas legacy, describing his journalistic credentials, particularly regarding his involvement in the Gukurahundi events, as terrible.\n\nFewer speak of his terrible role in aiding and abetting the Gukurahundi genocide in Matabeleland as Editor of the Chronicle newspaper. Im one of the few, alongside thousands of Gukurahundi victims, who believes thats what ultimately defines his credentials as a journalist.\n\nMalunga further asserted that Nyarota actively chose to side with the perpetrators of these appalling acts, a betrayal of his fundamental duty as a journalist.\n\nHe aided and abetted genocide. A better journalist would have sought to shine a spotlight on the horrors and the uneven impact on innocent civilians. He chose the side of the perpetrators and helped and cheered them to commit unspeakable atrocities.\n\nMalunga is far from alone in voicing these criticisms.\n\nDr. Admore Tshuma, a UK-based academic, recalls Nyarotas time at the state-funded Chronicle during the Gukurahundi years as a period of profound moral failing, allegedly endorsed by Nyarota himself.\n\nBut there is another side to his legacy, one that is etched in blood and silence.\n\nWhen I was at The Chronicle, I came across one of his editorial comments, one that shocked me to the core. In it, he pleaded with Robert Mugabe not to withdraw the 5th Brigade from Matabeleland, stating, and I quote: Ndebeles must be disciplined.\n\nThose chilling words were written at the very time when the 5th Brigade was leaving behind a trail of devastation, raped women, decapitated civilians, families shattered forever. Children grew up without parents, without homes, without even the basic dignity of schooling.\n\nTshuma added: The people of Matabeleland endured a genocide, and Geoffrey Nyarota, an editor entrusted with truth, chose not to expose the horror, but instead to endorse its execution.\n\nThe legacy of Gukurahundi continues to haunt Zanu-PF, as both late president Mugabe and President Emmerson Mnangagwa are inextricably linked to these historically appalling acts of murder and violence against the people of Matabeleland and Midlands.\n\n",

Africa will not be free, until the Western Sahara, is liberated, free and independent.\n\nFurther, Mnangagwa called for the total silencing of guns in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nSADC remains a relatively calm and peaceful region. For this, we are proud. However, I reiterate our call for lasting peace in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of Congo. The situation in Eastern DRC undermines the aspirations bequeathed to us by our Founding Fathers and outlined in the SADC Constitutive Act and Vision 2050.\n\nThe time to silence the guns, de-escalate tensions and hostilities as well as to engage in dialogue to secure mediated outcomes for long-lasting peace in DRC is now, said Mnangagwa.\n\nMeanwhile, the SADC chairperson flagged the need to develop modernised equipment to detect droughts as Africa has been impacted by the unpredicted climate change.\n\nOver the years, our region, has been greatly affected by recurring climate change induced disasters, leading to far reaching consequences for our people, economies, and environment.\n\nThe extreme weather patterns have resulted in frequent and severe droughts, threatening food security and livelihoods across our region.\n\nIt is our collective responsibility to take decisive action to mitigate and manage the effects of these natural disasters. To this end, the need to enhance our early warning capabilities, build resilience and adaptation capacities, leveraging on the deployment of science, technology and innovation cannot be over-emphasised, said Mnangagwa.\n\n",

            "content": "By ESPN Cricinfo\n\nFORMER Zimbabwe captain Brendan Taylor, currently serving a three-and-half-year ban for breaching the ICCs anti-corruption code, is eyeing an international comeback when his sanction ends in July.\n\nTaylor, 39, had initially considered a move into coaching but has been convinced to resume his playing career by Zimbabwe Crickets MD Givemore Makoni, with a view to playing the 2027 ODI World Cup, which Zimbabwe will co-host. Taylor will be eligible to play again on July 25 this year.\n\nI still want to play, and I believe I could make an impact as a player, Taylor told ESPNcricinfo.\n\nI look at where Im at physically and mentally and if I didnt feel I could do it, I wouldnt bother. Givemore has really supported me on this. He sort of shut down the coaching role for now and said, Can you play and try to push yourself up until the 2027 World Cup? Granted Ill be 41 then but with sobriety, Im living my truest form.\n\nTaylor admitted to drug and alcohol addiction problem at the same time he revealed an approach by match-fixers to spot fix after they filmed him using cocaine. He was threatened with the video being made public if he did not cooperate with them. Instead of going through with the fix, Taylor abruptly retired from international cricket in September 2021 and did not reveal the reasons. He only reported the incident to the ICC four months later and made the story public in January 2022.\n\nAt that point, Taylor also checked himself into a rehabilitation centre in Zimbabwes Nyanga region on the Mozambique border. He spent 90 days there, with one other patient and a sponsor who showed me a new way to live. He has since been clean and has started a private coaching facility at his home as well as, more recently, a gradual return to training.\n\nThe conditions of his sanction mean Taylor cannot play any officially recognised cricket or train with domestic or international sides. Instead, he has been using facilities at an elite independent school, St Johns College in Harare, often twice a day.\n\nTheyve got some great grass nets, and I spend a lot of time in the indoor high-performance centre there. I get in there nice and early, and I come back in the afternoon and do it all again and push myself, Taylor said.\n\nTheres lots of work to do, but I feel like Im there. Im not far off. Ive been doing some batting, and I need to incorporate some fielding and some keeping work because Ive got four months to go.\n\nAlthough it would have been great to be able to, Taylor will not be cleared to play by the time of Zimbabwes Test in England in May  their first against that opposition in more than two decades. But he hopes to be in the plans for a home series against New Zealand in August.\n\nThat will be followed by Zimbabwes hosting of the Africa Regional Qualifiers for next years T20 World Cup in September, though Taylor feels he has some work to do on his T20 game, where he has a strike rate of 123.96.\n\nI see myself definitely playing Tests and ODIs. With T20s, thats probably something I would have to really try and sharpen myself up at. But I look forward to that.\n\nHaving a home World Cup is quite special and weve had some heartache over these last few World Cups so hopefully we can turn that around.\n\nShould his comeback be successful, Taylor will be the fourth player in the Zimbabwe side in his late 30s, after Test and ODI captain Craig Ervine (39), T20I captain Sikandar Raza (38), and long-serving allrounder Sean Williams (also 38). Its in watching their performances that Taylor has found the belief that he has something more to contribute.\n\nThats been inspiring to me. If you look statistically, theyre at the top of the game. Theyre still some of the biggest contributors in the national side, and thats really given me that hope and belief that I can do this, he said.\n\nAnd its also about me just adding real service to the group. Its not an egotistical individual coming back trying to steal any headlines or anything like that. Ive been humbled properly. I look forward to really just adding value, which I probably didnt do to the best of my ability when I was there before.\n\nUltimately, its the feeling of having unfinished business that is calling Taylor back to playing. I wish I had offered a bit more to Zimbabwe cricket. Ive apologised and moved forward from that and I want to work with them.\n\nTaylor is also motivated by the idea of the home World Cup, especially as Zimbabwe have missed out on the last two ODI showpieces and he considers the 2015 tournament, where he was the fourth-highest run-scorer, the peak of his career.\n\nHaving a home World Cup is quite special and weve had some heartache over these last few World Cups so hopefully we can turn that around, he said.\n\nThe balance in our group is, I think, the best it has ever been and theres a huge drive from Zimbabwe Cricket to get this right and get things in place. For Givemore, this World Cup means the whole world to him. He just wants to get this right and put on a good show and I want to be reciprocal in that.\n\n",
