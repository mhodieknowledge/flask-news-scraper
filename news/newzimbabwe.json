Zvishavane General Hospital.The matter was initially reported as sudden death.Nurses who testified told court that Mpofu had told them that her baby was battling flu.After the death was reported at

We are targeting $165 million of that funding.Karo has already raised $37 million through a bond on the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange and may extend the facility. It may also raise between $50 million and $100 million through a gold streaming agreement, where a buyer provides upfront capital for a share of gold produced as a by-product.As far as the timing is concerned, we are looking at first ore in mill starting 15 months after we close the fundraising, Henwood said.Sitting on the Great Dyke, Karo will include a 10-year open-pit phase and a 30-year underground mine, producing 226,000 ounces annuallybehind Zimplats (646,000 oz) and Unki (244,000 oz).Karo had hoped to complete the mine in 2024, but had to push back timelines due to the collapse in global platinum prices, which has stalled investment across the industry.Phoevos Pouroulis, CEO of Tharisa, said: While we have slowed development at the Karo Platinum Project in line with capital availability, we have nevertheless continued work on infrastructure, water dams and further optimisations including commencing with studies for the future underground mine development, while presenting the opportunity to non-traditional financiers, who like us, see the long-term benefits of the uniqueness not only of this Tier 1 project but of the applications PGMs will play for decades to come.The Zimbabwe government has a free 15% stake in the mine, and has an option to buy a further 11%.\n\nManaging Director Bernard Pryor says the company has so far spent $140 million on developing the mine, which will be Zimbabwes third-largest platinum producer upon completion.\n\nEarthworks are always challenging, but weve completed them to 100%, Pryor said during a call with analysts on Thursday.The project will have a 132 kV powerline, while the Chirundazi Dam has been built to supply water.Its a big project, but everything that we need is in close proximity, he added.Karo has opened a tender for a mining contract to begin stripping overburden and prepare for mining.This is a large contract; we need a highly competent mining contract to move an extensive amount of material, some 1.41.5 million BCM (bank cubic metres) per month, said Pryor.On funding, Tharisa Financial Director Andrew Henwood says: We are in advanced talks with a lending syndicate, South African and African banks.

            "content": "By Pan Pylas l Associated Press\n\nLONDON: The British government will roll out the use of medication to suppress the sex drive of sex offenders, as part of a package of measures to reduce the risk of reoffending and alleviate the pressures on the prison system, which is running out of space.\n\nJustice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said Thursday that so-called chemical castration would be used in 20 prisons in two regions and that she was considering making it mandatory.Of course, it is vital that this approach is taken alongside psychological interventions that target other causes of offending, like asserting power and control, she said in a statement to Parliament following the release of an independent sentencing review.Though the review highlighted the treatment wouldnt be relevant for some sex offenders such as rapists driven by power and control, rather than sexual preoccupation, Mahmood said that studies show that chemical castration can lead to a 60% reduction in reoffending.Its been used in Germany and Denmark on a voluntary basis, and in Poland as mandatory for some offenders.The recommendation was part of a wide-ranging review led by former Justice Secretary David Gauke. As well as looking at ways to cut reoffending, Gauke recommended reforms to overhaul the prisons system, which is running at near capacity.One of the first things Mahmood did as justice minister after Labour returned to power after 14 years last July was sanction an early-release program for prisoners to free up space.She says she inherited a judicial system that had been neglected for years by the previous Conservative government and set up the review as a means to stabilize it.If our prisons collapse, courts are forced to suspend trials, she said.The police must halt their arrests, crime goes unpunished, criminals run amok and chaos reigns. We face the breakdown of law and order in this country.The review recommended that criminals could be released from prison earlier than they are now for good behavior, while judges could be given more flexibility to impose punishments such as driving bans.It also recommended that sentences of less than 12 months would also be scrapped for tougher community sentences. It also called for the immediate deportation for foreign nationals handed a three-year sentence or less.The review called for higher investment in the probation service to allow officers to spend more time with offenders for their rehabilitation and extra funding for the many more who are monitored with electronic tags in the community.Mahmood responded by giving a 700 million-pound ($930 million) a year for probation within years.If the government doesnt put the resources into probation that is necessary, then the risk here is that we wont make progress on rehabilitation that we need, and there will be a public backlash against it, Gauke said.The prison population in England and Wales has doubled over the past three decades or so to nearly 90,000. Thats despite a fall in crime rates and is driven in part by the fact that longer sentences are being handed out amid pressure to be tough on crime.Robert Jenrick, the justice spokesman for the Conservatives, warned that scrapping short sentences would be effectively decriminalizing offenses like burglary, theft and assault. And monitoring tags, he said, are as useful as smoke alarms putting out bonfires in stopping reoffending.In response, Mahmood said that she was clearing up the mess left by the Conservatives and that the government has also embarked on the largest expansion of prisons since Victorian times in the 19th century.\n\nJustice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said Thursday that so-called chemical castration would be used in 20 prisons in two regions and that she was considering making it mandatory.\n\nOf course, it is vital that this approach is taken alongside psychological interventions that target other causes of offending, like asserting power and control, she said in a statement to Parliament following the release of an independent sentencing review.Though the review highlighted the treatment wouldnt be relevant for some sex offenders such as rapists driven by power and control, rather than sexual preoccupation, Mahmood said that studies show that chemical castration can lead to a 60% reduction in reoffending.Its been used in Germany and Denmark on a voluntary basis, and in Poland as mandatory for some offenders.The recommendation was part of a wide-ranging review led by former Justice Secretary David Gauke.

I am lying kuti unonyepera kutuka Zanu maskati wopedza wezonovateera.\n\nMamombe demanded that Nyandoro responds within 10 days, indicating that if she fails to do so, the court will proceed with Mamombes claims without hearing from Nyandoro.\n\nIf you do not enter an appearance to defend, the plaintiffs claims will be heard and dealt with by the High Court without further notice to you.\n\n",
