I never wanted to take music as my career, but one person I believe in most gave me the courage to move forward with my God given talent.\n\nI will forever love my fans and family, but after this forthcoming album, I will no longer take music as my career again: rather as using my talent and fame to journey into my true purpose, which is healing people spiritually.\n\nIm tired of this celebrity lifestyle; It kills you within. I tried being brave while being insulted by everyone, including people you call your own, he wrote.\n\nBaba Keketso who is not new to controversy, has once in a while, found himself receiving backlash for his love scandals.\n\nI sing from the bottom of my heart just to make you happy and well entertained, but when I try Im insulted and given names which dont suit me.\n\nI know a lot of my fans will not be happy to hear this, but I am tired of trying to prove myself to a nation that never appreciates.\n\nI love music with my life, but here I have become small. I will sing for my kids at home after this album. I think this is not what I was born to do. God help me locate my true purpose, he added.\n\n",
