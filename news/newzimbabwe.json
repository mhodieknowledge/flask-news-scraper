            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nCITIZENS Coalitions for Change (CCC) Welshman Ncube faction has condemned the violence that ensued at a legislators funeral in Glen View South over the weekend.\n\nThe attacks occured during the funeral of CCC Glen View South Member of Parliament Grandmore Hakata (56), who died last week due to diabetes complications.\n\nMDC-T leader, Douglas Mwonzoras vehicle was allegedly damaged whilst a member of his political party, Preston Mwabaya, was seriously injured in the skirmishes and is reportedly admitted in the lntensive Care Unit (ICU) at a local hospital.\n\nScreengrab from a video circulating showing CCC youths heckling Mwonzora as he leaves the funeral venue\n\nIn a statement this Sunday, CCC Ncube faction spokesperson Willias Madzimure condemned the violence, accusing former CCC leader Nelson Chamisa of causing the mayhem.\n\nThe Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) condemns in the strongest terms the violence that erupted at the funeral of our beloved member, Hon. Hakata, who was a loyal member of the CCC led by Prof. Welshman Ncube. Hon Hakata had stood firm in his principles and refused to resign from Parliament when ordered to do so by Hon Nelson Chamisa.\n\nWe are deeply disturbed by the actions of certain individuals who sought to disrupt the peaceful proceedings and cause harm to innocent mourners.\n\nAmong those who were attacked and harassed by the perpetrators were Hon. Matsunga, Hon. P. Chitimbe, Hon. Musarurwa, and Hon. Madzimure, all of whom were present to pay their respects to the deceased.\n\nWe are disappointed that Hon. Nelson Chamisa, when he addressed his supporters and the mourners, failed to condemn the violence. As a leader, it is imperative to promote peace and stability, and we expect more from those who aspire to lead our nation, Madzimure said.\n\nHe said his party was outraged by the attack on Senator Mwonzora, the president of MDC-T party, and the damage to his vehicle and called on law enforcement agents to deal with perpetrators.\n\nThis blatant display of thuggery and intimidation is a clear indication of the lack of leadership and accountability within Hon Nelson Chamisas camp.\n\nAs a party, we value the principles of peace, tolerance, and respect for human life. We urge all our supporters and members to remain calm and peaceful, even in the face of provocation.\n\nWe call upon the authorities to investigate the violence and bring the perpetrators to justice. We also urge all Zimbabweans to promote a culture of peace, tolerance, and respect for human life, added Madzimure.\n\nAccording to witnesses and opposition members who attended the funeral, some of the youths involved in the attacks were visibly drunk.\n\n",

Dlamini returned to Zimbabwe after two decades.\n\nWill Luthuli Dlamini Return to Soapie Stardom?\n\nFans of the charismatic actor have been eager to know if Dlamini plans to grace television screens in a soapie again.\n\nHis response was characteristically playful: Yes, no, definitely, well . . . look, I dont know. The space Im currently in and have always been in is that I will work until the day I die, doing what I love doing.\n\nWhile he left his intentions ambiguous, his passion for acting remains undeniable.\n\nLuthuli Dlaminis Most Cherished Role\n\nAlthough many fans associate Dlamini with his iconic portrayal of Stan Nyathi, he revealed that his most cherished role is one that might surprise many.\n\nIt would be the role of Christopher in a stage play I did at the Liberty Theatre on Mandela Square in Sandton. This is because the play was based on an award-winning book in London that I had never read before.\n\nWhen I was offered the role, I was drawn to it because it was challenging and complex. It was a lovely piece for all of us. I understand why he won the award because it was a lovely piece, he shared.\n\nA Humble Homecoming\n\nReflecting on his long absence from Zimbabwe, Dlamini admitted: Im even embarrassed that its been this long since I was away. I need to come back and reacquaint myself with the scene. Theres a lot I have to learn and see.\n\nA New Chapter for Zimbabwes Film and Arts Scene?\n\nDlamini, celebrated for his role as Stan Nyathi in the popular eTV soapie Scandal, expressed admiration for the untapped potential in Zimbabwes arts and film industries.\n\nEver since Ive been here, Ive seen a lot of potential within the film sector and other facets of art. As I was watching a play at the Bulawayo Theatre, I could see how invested these young ones are. Theres so much more we could do to help them, he told The Chronicle.\n\nThe actors observations highlight a deep appreciation for the talent and dedication of local artists.\n\nDlamini hinted at a personal desire to contribute to the industrys growth, potentially signaling exciting collaborations and mentorship opportunities in the future.\n\nFrom Rumours to Reality\n\nDlaminis return to Zimbabwe has not been without speculation. Reports of alleged hardships, including homelessness in Johannesburg, dominated headlines in recent months.\n\nImages of the actor with his family showcase moments of connection. Reports of his involvement in new projects highlight a sense of renewal and purpose.\n\nThe actors return to Zimbabwe highlights the potential of the countrys creative industries. Whether through acting, mentorship, or advocacy, his influence is poised to leave an indelible mark.\n\n",

Ndokubva ndabvunza kuti nhaiwe? Zvaunotaura, nekuparadza kwawaita unoti woda kuenda kuseri kwegomo nekuparadza kwawaita. Unoda kuendepi?\n\nChamisa urged opposition activists to defend virtues Hakata stood for to improve citizens welfare.\n\nThe late MP, a Chamisa loyalist, rose to prominence following his widely reported arrest a few days before the 2023 general elections for allegedly holding a car rally. He won the elections while in prison anyway, only to be released after the polls.\n\nChamisa, a lawyer-cum-politician, who quit as CCC president citing infiltration by Zanu PF, has hinted at a comeback, urging his supporters to remain steadfast in the wake of machinations to decimate alternative voices.\n\nThe charismatic 47-year-old opposition leader was cheered by mourners as he announced Mnangagwas exit was coming soon, stating he who says l am not going, is already gone.\n\nAddressing the same gathering, firebrand opposition activist and former legislator, Gift Ostallos Siziba said those opposed to Zanu PF are the majority hence must resist the term extension, which is expected to come into effect through constitutional amendments and referendums.\n\nWe are the majority, and we wont accept the 2030 agendayou cannot extend a stolen mandate.\n\nMnangagwa has no mandate to remain in office beyond 2028. The 2023 (disputed election result) has to be resolved before we talk about 2028the person elected by the people was Advocate Nelson Chamisa, said Siziba.\n\nHe said Zanu PF was using United States dollars to buy the allegiance of some sellout CCC members, a carrot that Hakata resisted and stayed loyal to the struggle for a democratic country.\n\nDespite Mnangagwa spurning overtures to extend his term courtesy of a party resolution now dubbed Resolution#1 at last years Zanu PF National Peoples Conference in Bulawayo arguing he is a constitutionalist, he is rumoured to be sponsoring factionalists pushing the 2030 agenda.\n\n",

It is easy to feel helpless and powerless when faced with oppression and injustice.\n\nHowever, as Christians, we are called to live differently, even in the midst of adversity.\n\nIn Psalm 37:1-7, David encourages us not to fret or be envious of those who do evil. Instead, we are to trust in the Lord, do good, and dwell in the land.\n\nThis means that we should focus on living a life that honours God, even when our circumstances are difficult.\n\nIn Romans 13:1-7, Paul reminds us that all authority comes from God. While this doesnt mean that we should blindly obey unjust rulers, it does mean that we should respect the authority that God has established. We can do this by praying for our leaders, paying taxes, and obeying laws that dont contradict Gods Word.\n\nIn 1 Peter 2:13-17, Peter encourages us to submit to every human authority for the Lords sake.\n\nThis doesnt mean that we should compromise our values or principles, but rather that we should live in a way that honours God, even when we disagree with those in authority.\n\nSo, how can we live under a dictatorship government in a way that honours God? Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Pray for your leaders, even if you disagree with them. (1 Timothy 2:1-4)\n\n2. Respect the authority that God has established, while also standing up for justice and righteousness. (Romans 13:1-7)\n\n3. Focus on living a life that honours God, rather than GETTING bogged down in politics. (Psalm 37:1-7)\n\n4. Support and encourage one another, especially those who are suffering under oppression. (Galatians 6:2)\n\nPRAYER\n\nDear Heavenly Father,\n\nWe come before you today, praying for our brothers and sisters who are living under dictatorship governments in Africa.\n\nWe ask that you give them wisdom and discernment as they navigate these challenging circumstances.\n\nWe pray that you would protect them from harm and give them courage to stand up for justice and righteousness.\n\nWe ask that you provide for their physical and emotional needs, and that you would give them hope and encouragement in the midst of adversity.\n\nWe pray that you would change the hearts of those in authority, that they would rule with justice and compassion.\n\nAnd we pray that you would bring an end to oppression and injustice, that your people might live in peace and freedom.\n\nIn Jesus name we pray,\n\nAMEN.\n\n",

While DR Congo has severed diplomatic ties with neighbouring Rwanda, accusing the country of being behind the rebellion.\n\nThe move comes after M23 fighters killed a Congolese military governor who was visiting the frontline on Thursday. Earlier in January, they captured the key eastern Congolese towns of Minova and Masisi.\n\nMacron called for an end to the fighting in separate calls with the leaders of DR Congo and Rwanda on Saturday, his office said.\n\nThe EUs foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas urged the M23 to halt its advance and condemned Rwandas support for the group, the AFP news agency reports.\n\nFurther condemnation came from Angolan President Joao Lourenco, the African Unions mediator between Rwanda and DR Congo, who denounced irresponsible actions by the M23 and its supporters and called for the immediate cessation of fighting to preserve civilian lives, according to the AFP news agency.Fighting between the M23 and DR Congos army has intensified since the start of the year, with the rebels seizing control of more territory than ever.\n\nThe conflict has already led more than 400,000 people to flee their homes this year, according to the UN.\n\nLocal leaders last week said more than 200 civilians had been killed in areas captured by the M23, with hospitals in Goma treating hundreds of patients.\n\nMartin Gordon, an Anglican bishop in Goma, told the BBC fighting in the country had gone on way too long and people will do anything for peace.\n\nIn the past few days, several countries have urged their citizens to leave Goma, including the UK, France, Germany and the US.\n\nHuman Rights Watch has warned of escalating risks to civilians as the Congolese army battles the M23 rebels. The humanitarian group has accused both sides of committing grave abuses against civilians.\n\nThe UN has warned that the ongoing conflict is worsening the humanitarian crisis in the region.\n\nThe M23 has taken control of vast swathes of mineral-rich eastern DR Congo since 2021. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced as a consequence.\n\nDR Congo and the UN say the M23 is backed by Rwanda. The Rwandan authorities have neither confirmed nor denied this.\n\nRwanda has previously said the authorities in DR Congo were working with some of those responsible for the 1994 Rwandan genocide against ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus.\n\nThe M23 formed as an offshoot of another rebel group in 2012, ostensibly to protect the Tutsi population in the east of DR Congo, which had long complained of persecution and discrimination.\n\nHowever, Rwandas critics accuse it of using the M23 to loot eastern DR Congos minerals such as gold, cobalt and tantalum.\n\n",

You saw it with the audit firms that exited, local partners took over the practice. I was very pleased with that.\n\nIn 2024, Deloitte exited Zimbabwe, and its operations were taken over by Axcentium, a firm led by former Deloitte partners who cited the need for flexibility and agility in Zimbabwes evolving market.\n\nPwC also left the market last year, with Vista Chartered Accountants taking its place.\n\nNot everyone shares Ncubes optimism about the exit of global accounting firms.\n\nWhen such a globally recognised institution exits a market, the ramifications are not just symbolicthey are structural. It reflects systemic economic and governance issues and sends a loud message to both local and international stakeholders about the countrys operating environment, says Brighton Musonza, an accountant and business commentator.\n\nRetailer Choppies announced its departure from Zimbabwe in December, citing the impact of Ncubes exchange rate policies which have decimated formal retail and boosted informal traders. Choppies sold its business Sai Mart, owned by Deputy Minister Raj Modi.\n\nNcube insists: If you look at Choppies, a local investor is taking over the asset. We are not short of local investors who are ready to step in to replace some of these foreign investors.\n\nBut well make sure we step in to address some of the challenges that businesses face. Well work on that to attract new investment and encourage expansion by those who are already on the ground.\n\nLast year, Unilever announced it would exit the country and use local distributors instead to sell its brands in Zimbabwe. This added to a list of other multinationals who have left the country.\n\nStandard Chartered last year sold its business to FBC Holdings for $24 million as it left Zimbabwe and several other markets around the world.\n\nHolcim disposed of its cement plant in Zimbabwe to Fossil in 2022 for $29.7 million. Nampak is currently in the process of selling its 51% stake in the countrys biggest packaging business to TSL for $25 million.\n\n",
