Beta said it was investing in two plants, in Mt Hampden and Melfort, hoping to increase capacity from 6 million bricks a month to 24 million a month. But thin capital has seen production fall over recent years. In 2023, the company said it was failing to pay workers at Mt Hampden due to unprecedented challenges.\n\nThe company had taken out loans, including from banks, and is failing to pay them off. By November, was had arrears of US$1.2 million on its loans. Says Beta: The company is therefore potentially liable, jointly, and severally, to settle the outstanding balance in the sum of US$9,620,743.25. The potential liability comes at a time when the company is not generating any revenue, which can be used to settle the claim.\n\nThe board believes the company can still be saved, and that given the current construction boom in the country, there is high demand for products manufactured by the company.\n\nCompetition is rising in the brick business, with new, smaller and nimbler players eating away at the market share of dominant brick makers, at a time demand for bricks is strong.\n\nAnother company, Willdale, is selling idle land to raise money for a new plant, which it needs to catch up with thriving competitors. Willdales old plants and high costs have seen it struggle to meet orders from customers.\n\n",

Without being specific where the moratorium will be applied, Garwe said CoH has been directed to halt the impending demolition of over 5,000 housing units.\n\nStop it as it emerges. Why wait for someone to build and then demolish? Let us be morally correct.\n\nNo 5,000 houses are going to be demolished by the city (Harare) and to make matters worse, who gave them those pieces of land? Is it not the corrupt council officials? Garwe said.\n\nHe added, We are against demolishing. Where were you as a City Father when this piece of land was being sold? We cannot be more stupid than that. Definitely, we cannot, the minister said.\n\nRecently, residents lost homes in Belvedere where CoH demolished several upmarket properties as owners haplessly watched in the presence of the police.\n\n",

We are now in the process of inviting private sector players, both local and international, to bring proposals, expressions of interest. These are going to be unsolicited bids.\n\nWe want somebody with the capacity to engineer, to procure, to construct and manage the finance. Thats the model that we are working on. Engineering, procurement, construction, management and finance.\n\nThese are unsolicited bids. So, as we speak, weve already received about five expressions of interest from local players and three from international players. So, its work in progress, Garwe said.\n\nHe was hoping that by the end of next week, his ministry would have identified and interviewed all interested players.\n\nBy end of next week, we would have identified the most suitable people that have applied and appointed them, at least signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), and then a Memorandum of Agreement.\n\nWe want by the end of this month to have dealt with the issue of water in Harare, added Garwe.\n\nHe said a lot of purified water was being lost through leakages.\n\nBy the time it reaches a resident, its just a fraction of what has been purified. We are looking at an investor who comes and covers the whole value chain, from purification to distribution to billing and metering.\n\nWe want to move away from the old metre system to digital metre systems, the smart water metering systems. Thats what we are doing, he stated.\n\nGarwe promised that by the end of this month or early February, there will be movement in this regard not in Harare alone but in all urban councils countrywide.\n\nWe are looking at all our cities. We have started, but the invitations are not focused on Harare, they are focused on all the urban cities.\n\nPriority areas are Harare, Bulawayo and Victoria Falls.\n\nBesides the privatisation of water services, government will also privatise all other services such as solid and liquid waste management systems to make sure cases of burst pipes are dealt with once and for all.\n\nChitungwiza and most of Harares suburbs have gone for years with raw sewage flowing in residential areas.\n\nGarwe urged journalists to wait for the Commission of Inquiry to complete its investigations on Harare City regarding some allegations.\n\nLet the Commission do its work and then we can find a way forward, said Garwe.\n\nThe minister also explained that the privatisation of public services in urban councils was not coming at a premium to residents.\n\nTechnology is cheaper. Many people think it is expensive to privatise services, cautioned Garwe.\n\n",

This decision is flawed for two reasons:\n\nExpired Term: A term that has already expired cannot be extended. Thats why there are no oxygen canisters at the cemetery.\n\nRetirement Age: General Sibanda has reached the mandatory retirement age of 70. He cannot be retired and in active service at the same time.

And for Mnangagwa, what a way to perpetuate a disgraceful legacy anchored on absurdities and illegalities, said Mpofu.\n\nSibanda has served as the Commander of the ZDF since 2017, succeeding the current Vice President, Constantino Chiwenga, who previously held the position.\n\n",
