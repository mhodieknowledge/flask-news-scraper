I did not say fairly, I said equitably because the International Monetary Fund (IMF) tells us that in 2021 they distributed their funds fairly, wherein Africa received US$33,3 billion against a pocket size of US$650 billion, he said.Mangudya said the disbursements made to Africa amounted to 5% of the special drawing rights (SDRs), a reality which contradicted the fact that Africa required the money much more than the Western high income countries.As a result of that inequitable distribution, those countries cannot use those funds and, therefore, they are now talking about the reallocation of the SDRs. It means that in the first place those funds were not equitably disbursed so thats why there is need for our institutions to ensure equitable distribution of funds, he said.The seasoned banker said in order to achieve a resilient financial architecture across the continent there is need for local institutions to work together towards the common agenda backed by a relevant ecosystem.He said the shareholders and the users of the funds must place Africas growth by investing in value addition and curbing the export of raw materials.Africas institutions must provide de-risking instruments such as guarantees, political risk insurance, credit enhancement and concessional funding, added Mangudya.\n\nHe made the remarks during a panel discussion at the Afreximbank 2025 Annual Meetings, which were held in Abuja, Nigeria from June 25 and ended yesterday.\n\nThe former central bank governor and current Mutapa Investment Fund CEO was proffering possible solutions on how the African regional blocs and financial institutions can enforce a resilient financial architecture.These institutions should be catalysts of development by deploying resources equitably.

As locals we were able to engage the mining companies in our community following training on advocacy and engagement we received from Silveira House. Despite the delays, we are now able to access quality health care within our communities, said Maybe Mashamba from Nyamuganhu village.\n\nShe said community members also played a part through brick laying and providing labour while the companies assisted through injection of finances and expertise for other necessities.\n\nPrior to the completion of this clinic we used to travel for 18 kilometers to Katsukunye Clinic and such long distances forced many villagers to give up on accessing health care. It was even worse for conditions like HIV/AIDS since many could not access testing services and treatment, she said.\n\nMashamba added the clinic has also assisted pregnant women with safe deliveries close to home.\n\nAnother villager, Tichatonga Nyangu of Mutoko Centre described the development as a dream come true, which has spurred health and safety for the workers employed at mining companies in the area.\n\nCommenting on the development, Silveira House projects manager, Zandile Mvududu said while the project completion is welcome, there is need to treat CSR projects with urgency.\n\nIt is indeed a very positive step but there is a need to find ways to make sure that such CSR projects are implemented well within the time frames. In this case it has taken over 15 years for Gurure Clinic to be completed, she said.\n\n",
