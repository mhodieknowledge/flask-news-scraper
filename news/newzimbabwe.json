Taxes paid for the period under review, including Excise Duty, Corporate Tax, VAT, Customs Duties, PAYE and Withholding Tax, which came to a total of over USD8.1 million, he said.\n\nDespite the contribution, the company faced operational challenges. Sales volumes fell by 14%, largely due to weaker consumer spending and broader macroeconomic headwinds. Revenue also declined by 28%, dropping from US$18.1 million to US$13 million compared to the same period last year. The fall was attributed to constrained consumer incomes, a tough trading environment, and a shift in pricing strategy from ZWG to US$.\n\nCosts, however, moved in the opposite direction. The cost of sales rose by 31%, climbing to US$4.1 million from US$3.4 million in 2024, driven mainly by higher raw material prices.\n\nDespite these pressures, BAT recorded a profit before tax of US$6.6 million, a marked recovery from the US$10.6 million loss posted during the same period last year.\n\nZimbabwes ability to navigate the ever-changing macro-economic landscape and deliver long-term value to all stakeholders. Our optimism is grounded in the resilience of our people, our brands and unwavering commitment to innovation and transformation, added Manatsa.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nRetail giant OK Zimbabwe has reported a 53% decline in revenues, attributing the slump to supply chain disruptions, a liquidity crunch, and intensifying competition from the informal sector.\n\nPresenting the groups performance for the year ended March 31, 2025, OK Zimbabwe chairman Herbert Nkala said revenues fell to US$240 million, down 53% compared to the prior year, despite an average inflation rate of 15.21%.\n\nThe decline was linked to several factors, including exchange rate controls that distorted pricing and delayed supplier payments, which led to disruptions in product availability.\n\nSupply chain disruptions were as a result of the group failing to settle suppliers accounts on time leading to some withholding deliveries while others demanded payment upfront. These challenges resulted in the Groups operational capacity being impacted negatively, said Nkala.\n\nThe company carried out a comprehensive impairment review of all cash-generating units (CGUs). Due to constrained operational capacity, it recognised an impairment of US$10.3 million, as the recoverable amounts of certain CGUs fell below their carrying values.\n\nA net exchange gain of US$13.5 million was recorded, stemming from the revaluation of monetary liabilities after the devaluation of the Zimbabwe Gold (ZWG).\n\nDespite the challenges, the group has taken steps to strengthen its balance sheet. A rights issue raising US$20 million was concluded in July 2025, with proceeds received in August. An additional capital raise of US$10.5 million through the sale of immovable properties is underway, with offers currently under consideration.\n\nLooking ahead, cost optimisation and in-store as well as online sales strategies will remain central to achieving and sustaining the required growth. The recovery of the Group has started, but it will take some time to return to normal operations, added Nkala.\n\n",

The gang stole cellphones and laptops and attempted to break into an administration block at one of the schools around 3 am.\n\nThe on-duty security guard became suspicious and confronted the suspects. Police said the suspects opened fire in the guards direction before fleeing.\n\nThe guard later discovered one of the suspects lying on the ground with a gunshot wound. Paramedics certified the suspect dead at the scene. A post-mortem will be conducted to determine the exact cause of death, said Ledwaba.\n\nThe provincial murder and robbery unit, together with the Mopani tracking team, attended the scene and identified the deceased as a 36-year-old man from Seshego. The deceased is also reported to be a Zimbabwean national.\n\nFurther investigations led to the tracing of a vehicle allegedly used in the crimes. The driver, a 41-year-old man from Seshego, was arrested and is due to appear in the Nkowankowa Magistrates Court on Tuesday.\n\nPolice confirmed that two suspects remain at large and are actively being pursued.\n\nSAPS has urged anyone with information on the outstanding suspects to contact investigating officer Sergeant Eric Mathebula on 083 239 0977, call theCrime Stop number 08600 10111, report to the nearest police station, or use the My SAPS App.\n\n",
