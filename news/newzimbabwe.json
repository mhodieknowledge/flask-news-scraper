The applicants point in limine is upheld.\n\nThat being the case, there is no basis for the court to resolve the respondents preliminary points and consider its defence on the merits. The matter ends here, the judge ruled.\n\nTshabangu had argued that the term of office for the first to fourth respondents and main organs elected on 26 May 2019 expired on 27 May 2024, making their continued hold on office unlawful.\n\nThe judge upheld the argument.\n\nThe entire disciplinary process constituting the Disciplinary Committee that sat at number 60A Hibiscus Road, Lochnivar, Southerton, Harare on 12 February 2025 to deliberate and decide on allegations of misconduct leveled by the fifth respondent against the applicant be and are hereby declared null and void and are set aside,ruled the judge.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss the potential for diaspora property syndicates in Zimbabwe.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. In your view, isthis a potentially lucrative option?\n\nVM: Thank you\n\nYour question requires a holistic analysis of the property market and the fundamentals that allow or prohibit entry by individual players from the diaspora. In general terms, the last 20 years have witnessed an upward trend in property values. Seismic shifts in global markets like the 2008 global recession, whose effects were felt in markets around the world, hardly impacted Zimbabwe property pricing while property prices were falling around the world.\n\nThis, in my view, is a result of the fact that the majority of property ownership is free from mortgage or bank control. Therefore, prevailing interest rates do not have a significant bearing on property pricing in Zimbabwe.\n\nProperty pricing is usually seller-determined, although buyers have sway depending on the prevailing liquidity in the market.\n\nI mention this because it speaks to the potential returns for property investors normally positive. However, in the converse, the lack of widespread mortgage financing also limits the entry of individual players locally and in the diaspora, as most property sales and purchases require a onetime payment against a limited supply of banks offering mortgage services.\n\nThat being said, the answer to your question is yes, diaspora property syndicates are lucrative in that they potentially unlock foreign finance and, depending on objectives, may benefit from a cost-based market entry.\n\nReporter:What do you think are the things to consider in the formation of such syndicates?\n\nVM: It is critical that the documents constituting the syndicate are clear in what the syndicate intends to achieve, including the preferred property area of investment. Emphasis on this point may appear superfluous, however, you will be surprised at how easily groups of people may have a different understanding of the objectives of the group.\n\nSo if the syndicates intention is to enter the property market to specifically purchase land and construct housing for its members, be it clusters or flats, that must be clear. If, on the other hand, the intention is to develop properties for sale and money is shared among the syndicate members, those terms also must be clear. Here I am talking about governing documents regulating payments of dividends, repatriation of finances, project execution, rights and duties and dispute resolution.\n\nIt may also be advisable to create a similar, duly constituted legal vehicle in Zimbabwe that will execute the mandate on this side of the world.\n\nReporter: What legal protections are available or should be soughtfor such a vehicle?\n\nVM: The diaspora syndicate will enjoy the same protections the local investors enjoy as it relates to purchasing or disposing of property, subject to the proper due diligence being carried out.\n\nDepending on how the syndicate is constituted and its objectives, there may be a need and benefit to seek the assistance of the Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency (ZIDA) before investing. Should the syndicate want to repatriate profits or rentals, then the investment will need to be registered with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe and have the necessary exchange control approvals.\n\nThe syndicate must be duly incorporated in Zimbabwe or be sufficiently compliant for deed registration and operation in Zimbabwe.\n\nReporter: What potential challenges are likely to be faced by such syndicates?\n\nVM: A lack of contemporary on-the-ground knowledge of the property business may affect the syndicates progress, making it prone to title and fraud risk. It will be necessary to have a complement of applicable local professions to assist with the project.\n\nI also mention that the Zimbabwean economy and consequently the liquidity in the property market is in flux and prone to political and regulatory changes, and various opportunities and threats present themselves at various times.\n\nThere is no substitute for local knowledge, currency threats may be mitigated contractually and by registering the investment with ZIDA and or the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. Bureaucracy in some instances may prove a potential challenge, for example, maybe approvals for permits such as subdivision or cluster housing permits, et cetera, this really speaks to the selection of the local team in mitigating such risks\n\nReporter: In closing, what opportunities and benefits may this bring?\n\nVM: Our law allows for joint ventures with municipalities and local governments, opening up opportunities for urban renewal, job creation, skills transfer, economic growth and general development through these structures. The opportunities are immense both for the syndicate and the country.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima, we have to end here, because of our time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nThese discussions are of a general nature, and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

            "content": "By Chris Muronzi l Al Jazeera\n\nIT was 2017 and Jo Stak  wearing a red tuxedo jacket, a bow tie and a homburg hat  was belting out a Mandarin song.\n\nRed and yellow lights shimmered around him as a crowd of cheering, flag-waving fans on the Chinese version of The Voice gave a standing ovation at the end of his act.\n\nStaks melodious rendition of a 1992 Chinese song called The World Needs Warm Hearts was broadcast on national television.\n\nI was invited to perform at The Voice as a guest performer that year, Stak recalls.\n\nThe prime-time spot reflected how well-known hed become in China. On Douyin, Chinas version of TikTok, he had about five million followers.\n\nHed appeared on some of the countrys biggest television stations. Fans stopped him on the street to ask for a photo or just have a chat. The Zimbabwean singer was riding high.\n\nBeing Black in China makes you stand out naturally, he explains.\n\nAnd I was a musician [so that] made me stand out more.\n\nThe people who stopped him were often impressed that a foreigner would sing in Mandarin.\n\nToday, in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare, Joe Takawira  Staks real name  is an inconspicuous figure walking down a street in Budiriro 5, the working class suburb where he was born and raised.\n\nIn 2019, after seven years in China, his work visa expired, and he returned home.\n\nSporting his signature beard, grey sweatpants, sneakers and a black T-shirt, he lights a cigarette.\n\nHe saunters past street vendors selling fresh produce and condiments, stops at a corner to chat with a friend, then goes about his day. Whenever he runs into someone he knows, he greets them with a fist bump and a toothy grin.\n\nWhen hes at home, Stak listens to instrumental music and writes songs in Mandarin.\n\nThis is how I spend my time in Budiriro, he says, shrugging.\n\nIt feels a long way from China and the career he enjoyed there. He has not found the same acclaim back home.\n\nEven his neighbours had no idea about his previous life.\n\nClemence Kadzomba, who runs a tyre shop in Staks neighbourhood, had no idea who his neighbour was until some of his clients who were among the 20,000 Zimbabweans living in China recognised him.\n\nI couldnt believe it, 43-year-old Kadzomba says, grinning.\n\nThey were so excited to see him, like he was some big deal. And yet, here he was, just hanging out with us like it was nothing.\n\nUnexpected journey to stardom\n\nStaks musical journey has its roots in the Methodist church-run school he attended as a teenager.\n\nHe sang in his church choir, something he loved, and was part of a group of students who recorded a gospel album.\n\nThe album did well, and some of the songs have close to a million views on YouTube.\n\nMusic runs in his family, says Stak, the middle of three brothers. His older brother wrote songs at school while the youngest brother plays the piano.\n\nAfter graduating, Stak enrolled to study Mandarin in China in 2012, motivated by his love for Chinese culture, which began as a boy watching Jackie Chans action films. He was 20 years old when he moved to Shanghai.\n\nThis came at a time when Zimbabwe was pivoting away from the West with the late leader Robert Mugabes Look East policy, adopted in response to United States and European Union sanctions after a 2002 presidential election marred by violence.\n\nMugabe opened Zimbabwes doors to Asia, leading to an influx of Chinese investment as more Zimbabweans headed to China to work or study.\n\nBy 2014, Stak was proficient in Mandarin and started posting videos of himself singing in Mandarin to Douyin.\n\nI wanted to explore music in a different language, he explains as he lights a cigarette and sits back in his chair on the red-floored veranda of his house.\n\nHe would sing R&B, hip-hop and pop songs in Mandarin and English and started to get booked for gigs.\n\nMy first gig was at Yuyingtang, a music bar in Shanghai, he recalls. He says the venue wasnt very big but he made $1,500  enough to pay for his food and accommodation for months.\n\nThat gig made him realise he could make money from his talent, and it marked the start of his career as a professional pop singer in China.\n\nAfter that, he played at music bars, festivals, weddings and nightclubs  performing mostly in Mandarin.\n\nOf the 37 songs he recorded, one was in the top 10 on the Chinese music streaming service Baidu Music.\n\nIt meant a lot to me, Stak says excitedly, although it earned him only 5,000 yuan ($865).\n\nThen in 2017, he joined the Foundation Band, a group of musicians from Africa, the US and Europe that performed Chinese and Western pop music and hip-hop at weddings and nightclubs.\n\nAs the lead vocalist, he caught the attention of Chinese television networks, leading to performances on major stations.\n\nI was surprised by my success in China, Stak admits.\n\nLife there was good. His daily routine consisted mainly of eating, singing and drinking.\n\nHis favourite dish was hotpot  a meal for which diners cook raw ingredients like seafood and tofu in a shared pot of broth at the table.\n\nEven now, when I miss it, I go to Chinese restaurants, he says.\n\nHed perform at night, and during the day, hed roam along Shanghais historic waterfront with its colonial-era architecture and rooftop bars.\n\nStak made good money. They pay artists well  I mean 1,000 US dollars minimum for a 10-minute show.\n\nBut he also felt accepted and at home in China, where he says the music industry welcomes foreign talent and invests in it.\n\nUnlike many foreign artists singing in English who can struggle to break into the Chinese market, Stak had an edge  he was an African singing in Mandarin, and there were few performers like him. His ability to perform popular Chinese songs endeared him to audiences.\n\nComing home to anonymity\n\nThen in 2019, Staks visa expired. Aged 27, he returned to a country that was in the midst of a devastating economic crisis.\n\nHis parents  his fathers an engineer, his mothers a teacher  were coping, but across the country, people were struggling with hyperinflation, foreign currency shortages and an unemployment rate of more than 50 percent.\n\nStak found work as a translator  and quickly discovered that Zimbabwes music and social media landscapes were unfamiliar to him.\n\nHe says much of his fame and success came from Chinese apps, mostly Douyin. But the apps he relied on are available only in China as Beijing restricts foreign digital platforms through its Great Firewall.\n\nWithout them, Stak could no longer reach his Chinese audience.\n\nHis career vanished when he left Shanghai. I feel like a part of me remained in China, he explains.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, nobody knew him. He started recording some music  and contemplated a switch to gospel, which is popular in the country  but hes struggled to promote his songs. When he contacted a local radio station to play his music, he never heard back.\n\nStak believes that if Chinese social media were accessible to global audiences, he would still have a thriving musical career.\n\nThat would have brought me international recognition, he says.\n\nFor now, the translation work pays well. He currently works for a Chinese mining company, translating English or Shona into Mandarin. When he isnt working, he tries to write music, but full-time work leaves little time to reinvent himself or find an audience for his Chinese pop.\n\nLonging for the stage\n\nToday, Stak is torn. He dreams of a return to China but also wants to rebuild his music career in Zimbabwe, where he hopes to marry and raise a family.\n\nI want to start afresh here, he says.\n\nBut I also miss China, a country that was very good and welcoming to him, he adds.\n\nWhether its in Asia or Africa, he itches to return to the stage. I miss the spotlight, he says.\n\nFive years after he left China, Stak remains popular there. A couple of months ago, his Chinese boss uploaded a video of him singing in Mandarin. [He] posted me on his WeChat status, and people were asking him about me. They were like, Where is this guy?\n\nStak takes a moment and then adds, The Chinese love me.\n\n",
