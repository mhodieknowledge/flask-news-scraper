            "content": "By Xinhua\n\nCHINESE language learners in Zimbabwe on Friday showcased their language skills during the 24th Chinese Bridge competition organized by the Confucius Institute at the University of Zimbabwe in Harare, the countrys capital.\n\nDrawing participants from primary schools, high schools, and colleges, the competition consisted of a speech in Chinese and a talent show.Kudakwashe Makoni, a student of political science and diplomacy at the University of Zimbabwe, stood out with his grasp of the Chinese language and knowledge of Chinese culture.He told Xinhua that the Chinese language serves not only as a practical skill to learn in a globalized world, but also as a bridge between the two countries.Learning Chinese provides huge opportunities for Zimbabweans. You can get scholarships to study in China, and also, with the rapidly growing Chinese economy, there is an opportunity for trade, so we can leverage the opportunity to create an amicable relationship between Zimbabwe and China, he said.Thandeka Risinamhodzi, a high school student from Harare, was elated to be crowned the champion in the high school students segment.Chinese is a very exciting language that you can learn. Learning Chinese benefits in many ways, like in Zimbabwe, most things involve the Chinese, like job opportunities, she said.Makoni and Risinamhodzi will represent Zimbabwe at the international finals of the Chinese Bridge competition in China later this year.In his address to the contest, Attwell Mamvuto, pro-vice-chancellor for academic affairs and administration at the University of Zimbabwe, said the competition not only celebrates linguistic excellence, but also marks the enduring friendship and cooperation between the two countries.Learning a new language opens doors to new opportunities, fosters understanding, and builds bridges between people from different backgrounds. The Chinese language, with its rich history and vast number of speakers, is a particularly valuable asset. It also augurs well with the University of Zimbabwes strategic thrust on the internationalization agenda as well as academic and cultural exchanges, he said.Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Zhou Ding said the growing number of Zimbabweans learning Chinese demonstrates the languages global prominence and the importance and vitality of the enduring partnership between China and Zimbabwe.This year, as we celebrate the 45th anniversary of China-Zimbabwe diplomatic relations, which are rooted in solidarity, shared aspiration, and mutual benefit, we also celebrate decades of our joint achievements, which include the robust educational and cultural collaboration between our two countries, Zhou added.\n\nDrawing participants from primary schools, high schools, and colleges, the competition consisted of a speech in Chinese and a talent show.\n\nKudakwashe Makoni, a student of political science and diplomacy at the University of Zimbabwe, stood out with his grasp of the Chinese language and knowledge of Chinese culture.He told Xinhua that the Chinese language serves not only as a practical skill to learn in a globalized world, but also as a bridge between the two countries.Learning Chinese provides huge opportunities for Zimbabweans.

Built at a cost of US$88m, the interchange is a shoddy, vulgar sobriquet of raw looting and grandiose theft of public funds, Biti wrote on his X account Saturday.\n\nThe US$88m is way out of line with comparative regional projects that have cost significantly less. For instance, SAs Mount Edgecombe project, the biggest in Africa which cost US$70 million.\n\nThe former Treasury chief also labelled Mnangagwas government as a mafia group, which bypassed tender processes and awarded the contract to build such a huge project to Mnangagwas alleged cronies.\n\nThe project was not subject to international tender but instead was awarded to a local cartel and its associates, that has been at the centre of massive looting of public coffers since 2017.\n\nThe cartel has been the biggest recipient of all Treasury Bills issued in this country and has been active in Command Agriculture, mining, fuel, banking, financial services, buses, roads, hospitals, retail and general procurement, he said.\n\nBiti called on Parliament to carry out a forensic audit to establish how the project was funded, saying the entire financing process has been opaque, contrary to Public Finance Management principles, which emphasise on transparency and accountability.\n\nThese questions arise because of the predatory veil of opaqueness that has been the MO (modus operandi) of the regime. Parliament must cause a forensic audit of this project and examining legal financial & engineering constructs of this pagoda. Corruption must stop.\n\nMeanwhile, the public, through social media, has voiced concerns regarding the project and expressed shock that it cost US$88 million, attacking Mnangagwa and his government as corrupt leaders.\n\n",

This was after his company, TN Asset Management, underwrote a rights issue for the company late last year.\n\nResponding on his X (formerly Twitter) recently, Nyambirai clarified that while he cannot speak on behalf of Steward Bank or EcoCash Holdings, he vowed to push for an official disclosure via the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE).\n\nA legal notice on the change of name of Steward Bank Limited has generated a lot of interest here on X.\n\nWe shall seek the authority of the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange to publish an update on the name changes. The update shall seek to answer some of the questions that have been raised, he said.\n\nA name looked at in the abstract might be meaningless. But the way the owner carries the name gives it value. Many Zimbabwean bank names lack obvious meanings, yet their strength lies in how they deliver on their promises.\n\nThe present generation would have demanded that Henry Wells and William Fargo change names first, before they named their banks, Wells Fargo after themselves, he said.\n\nThe rebranding process, he noted, will follow stringent corporate governance procedures, including shareholder consultations.\n\nMarket watchers believe that Nyambirais challenge remains convincing the public that the new identity will uphold or surpass the banks legacy.\n\n",
