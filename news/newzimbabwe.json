confirmation of paternity before criminal sanctions can be imposed on men presumed to be fathers of children seeking child support.\n\nIn a petition submitted to the Speaker of Parliament, Jacob Mudenda under Section 149 of the Constitution, Guta noted glaring shortcomings in the current Maintenance Act (Chapter 5:09), particularly Section 23.The provision currently allows for the imprisonment of individuals, who default on maintenance payments, even in cases where biological paternity has not been scientifically or legally confirmed.Guta, who is based in Kadoma, posited that the absence of a mandatory paternity test or legal declaration has resulted in numerous Zimbabwean men jailed based on disputed or later disproved parentage.Many have suffered loss of liberty, reputational damage, psychological trauma, and unjust criminal records, Guta submitted.He described the consequences as irreparable harm caused by an outdated and unjust process.Citing Section 49(1)(a) of the Constitution, which guarantees the right to personal liberty, Guta called on Parliament to urgently review and tweek the law to align it with constitutional safeguards.He opined the inclusion of a new clause under Section 23 of the Act, which would require that no legal proceedings be initiated unless paternity is confirmed through voluntary acknowledgement, a court declaration, or a DNA test, especially where paternity is disputed.The petition is expected to be reviewed by Parliaments relevant committees as part of the legislative process.\n\nIn a petition submitted to the

            "content": "By Tapiwa Svondo\n\nRUTENDO Maregere, widely known in the music world as Frya, is a talented Zimbabwean singer based in South Africa making waves globally.\n\nMany people worldwide have heard her voice without even knowing it, she sang the theme song for the popular Netflix show, Blood & Water, a song she created with Mr Kamera, real name Tatenda Kamera, and also a Zimbabwean music producer based in South Africa.\n\nDespite her international success, Frya holds a special dream that highlights her deep connection to her roots. She revealed in an interview with NewZimbabwe.com that she wants to collaborate with famous Zimbabwean gospel group, Vabati VaJehova.\n\nThe one Zimbabwean collaboration left that I would really love would be with Vabati VaJehova. I have been a huge fan since I was a kid in primary school, no one around me ever understood the correlation but their music soothes my soul and their sound scape is so spiritual and pure. I listen to their songs every single day (I kid you not), Frya shares, sounding excited.\n\nOne day I know Im going to have the privilege of working with them and Im probably going to weep when I meet them because Im such a huge fan and l have a lot of love and respect for how they have remained authentic through generations, said Frya.\n\nThis shows that even though shes known for modern Zim dancehall hits with stars like Winky D and Nutty O, her faith and heritage are very important to her.\n\nHer path to stardom began when a casual Instagram video of her singing an Adele cover went viral, catching the eye of a South African TV producer. This led to her first official music credit: the title track for the show Side Dish.\n\nAfter the Kure remix in 2019, Frya made the big decision in 2020 to focus on music full-time, which led to her music being featured in other shows like The River, Lockdown, and Glamorous Girls.\n\nHow did South Africa help Fryas music career but still keeping Zimbabwe at heart?\n\nSouth Africa is a melting pot of a lot of beautiful African sounds, so being exposed to artists from different walks of life who express themselves differently inspired me to do the same.\n\nIn terms of my Zimbabwean roots that goes without saying, its literally in my DNA and through every single project I have incorporated my culture through the producers Ive worked with, the drums and instruments, the Shona lyrics in my music and the collaborations lve done with other Zimbabwean artists, said Frya.The advantages of working across the borders and being able to work in both Zimbabwe and South AfricaThe advantages I think involve casting my net wide, operating across two musical landscapes exposed my music to a wider audience which is good because music has become globalised so its important to adapt. More exposure means a higher probability of more opportunities as well. I dont really look at the disadvantages / challenges.I get to do what I love everyday and live off of it and that in itself is a huge blessing. The South African people and the industry have embraced me and Im truly thankful. There is opportunity all around us especially as creatives and even though everyone is fighting to be heard and recognised l have always chosen to go through life with the perspective of focusing on my focus, the good and pouring my energy into creating art that is authentic to me, explained Frya.Whats next for Frya and her aspirations for her music in the next few years?Global exposure, Im very excited for whats to come, there are a lot of international collaborations coming with artists, creatives and brands. I love my people and I appreciate how theyve rallied for me. The aim is to keep working hard, raising the flag and expressing myself authentically through good music. God will handle the rest.Fryas message for aspiring Zimbabwean artists, especially those who might be considering pursuing their careers from abroadIm still figuring a lot out myself but what I can say is if music is truly your calling then follow your dreams. Music is not an easy industry it requires purity, tenacity and perseverance. Work hard to perfect your craft to the best of your ability and always take the stairs, nothing worth having comes easy and nothing that comes easy lasts and anyone that tells you any different is lying to you, said Frya.\n\nIn terms of my Zimbabwean roots that goes without saying, its literally in my DNA and through every single project I have incorporated my culture through the producers Ive worked with, the drums and instruments, the Shona lyrics in my music and the collaborations lve done with other Zimbabwean artists, said Frya.\n\nThe advantages of working across the borders and being able to work in both Zimbabwe and South Africa\n\nThe advantages I think involve casting my net wide, operating across two musical landscapes exposed my music to a wider audience which is good because music has become globalised so its important to adapt. More exposure means a higher probability of more opportunities as well. I dont really look at the disadvantages / challenges.\n\nI get to do what I love everyday and live off of it and that in itself is a huge blessing. The South African people and the industry have embraced me and Im truly thankful. There is opportunity all around us especially as creatives and even though everyone is fighting to be heard and recognised l have always chosen to go through life with the perspective of focusing on my focus, the good and pouring my energy into creating art that is authentic to me, explained Frya.Whats next for Frya and her aspirations for her music in the next few years?Global exposure, Im very excited for whats to come, there are a lot of international collaborations coming with artists, creatives and brands. I love my people and I appreciate how theyve rallied for me. The aim is to keep working hard, raising the flag and expressing myself authentically through good music.
