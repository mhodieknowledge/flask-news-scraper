            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA NAMIBIAN delegation is in Zimbabwe on a benchmarking mission aimed at strengthening cooperation in Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) with a particular focus on diamond cutting and polishing at Zimbabwes only Diamond Training Centre.\n\nThe delegation, led by Namibia Training Authority (NTA) Chief Operations Officer Penda Shilongo and Zimbabwean government officials visited polytechnics across the country, Chinhoyi University of Technology, Diamond Training Centre and the Zimbabwe School of Mines among other training institutions.The purpose of the visit is to learn from Zimbabwes experience in developing skills for mineral beneficiation and industrial value addition.Speaking during the visit to the Diamond Training Centre, an indigenous-owned institute based in Harare, Shilongo said Namibia wanted to draw lessons from Zimbabwes model of transforming natural resource wealth into employment through practical skills development.What we take home is that we need to start with mineral beneficiation in our country. At the moment, we do not have a training facility that offers these types of skills. We see this as an opportunity to collaborate and leverage the expertise of our sister country so that we can also add value to our mineral resources in Namibia, Shilongo said.He added that Namibia was eager to strengthen bilateral cooperation with Zimbabwe, particularly in upskilling trainers and aligning TVET standards across the SADC region.We invite our Zimbabwean counterparts to visit Namibia to identify areas where we can also assist each other. There is a lot to learn from one another, he said.The NTA, which regulates the countrys TVET system, is implementing reforms to bridge gaps in technical training and align courses with emerging industries such as green energy.Richard Kambinda, acting general manager for TVET and VTC development support, said Zimbabwes capacity in vocational training was impressive and that the visit would help Namibia build stronger foundations for technical education.We came to Zimbabwe on a study tour to see what programmes can help us bridge the gaps we have in Namibia, Kambinda said.We dont have a diamond-cutting college back home, so its important to learn from our brothers and sisters here. Weve seen that Zimbabwe has the capacity and we believe Zimbabwe can help us.The visit is part of a broader agenda to finalise a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two countries, focusing on dual certification, curriculum development, trainers capacity building, quality assurance, Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) integration, and SADC TVET harmonisation.Diamond Training Centre founder and director Lovemore Kurotwi said the visit was a significant recognition of Zimbabwes growing influence in technical skills transfer and beneficiation training.We are a private, indigenous-owned institution, and I am grateful to our government and the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education for licensing and recognising our pivotal role in this economy, Kurotwi said.We are transferring vital skills to our young people, which is key to building an industrialised nation.He said the institutes mission is to transform Zimbabwe from an exporter of raw minerals to a manufacturer of finished products.We complain about unemployment, yet we have all the resources. The missing link is skills. Without skills, there is no industry to talk about, he said. That is why our thrust is on training and skills transfer. When another government comes to benchmark us, it shows we are on the right path.The diamond training institute plays a strategic role in Zimbabwes mineral beneficiation agenda by equipping students with expertise in diamond cutting, polishing, grading, and valuation skills once exclusive to foreign operators.Kurotwi said the Namibian delegations tour shows growing continental cooperation in vocational education, as African nations increasingly seek to localise value addition and empower their youth through hands-on technical skills.Meanwhile, despite having a beneficiation policy, Zimbabwe still exports raw minerals.The country continues to train personnel, most of whom end up leaving because there is no beneficiation industry.\n\nThe delegation, led by Namibia Training Authority (NTA) Chief Operations Officer Penda Shilongo and Zimbabwean government officials visited polytechnics across the country, Chinhoyi University of Technology, Diamond Training Centre and the Zimbabwe School of Mines among other training institutions.\n\nThe purpose of the visit is to learn from Zimbabwes experience in developing skills for mineral beneficiation and industrial value addition.Speaking during the visit to the Diamond Training Centre, an indigenous-owned institute based in Harare, Shilongo said Namibia wanted to draw lessons from Zimbabwes model of transforming natural resource wealth into employment through practical skills development.What we take home is that we need to start with mineral beneficiation in our country.

When another government comes to benchmark us, it shows we are on the right path.The diamond training institute plays a strategic role in Zimbabwes mineral beneficiation agenda by equipping students with expertise in diamond cutting, polishing, grading, and valuation skills once exclusive to foreign operators.Kurotwi said the Namibian delegations tour shows growing continental cooperation in vocational education, as African nations increasingly seek to localise value addition and empower their youth through hands-on technical skills.Meanwhile, despite having a beneficiation policy, Zimbabwe still exports raw minerals.The country continues to train personnel, most of whom end up leaving because there is no beneficiation industry.\n\nThe purpose of the visit is to learn from Zimbabwes experience in developing skills for mineral beneficiation and industrial value addition.\n\nSpeaking during the visit to the Diamond Training Centre, an indigenous-owned institute based in Harare, Shilongo said Namibia wanted to draw lessons from Zimbabwes model of transforming natural resource wealth into employment through practical skills development.What we take home is that we need to start with mineral beneficiation in our country. At the moment, we do not have a training facility that offers these types of skills. We see this as an opportunity to collaborate and leverage the expertise of our sister country so that we can also add value to our mineral resources in Namibia, Shilongo said.He added that Namibia was eager to strengthen bilateral cooperation with Zimbabwe, particularly in upskilling trainers and aligning TVET standards across the SADC region.We invite our Zimbabwean counterparts to visit Namibia to identify areas where we can also assist each other. There is a lot to learn from one another, he said.The NTA, which regulates the countrys TVET system, is implementing reforms to bridge gaps in technical training and align courses with emerging industries such as green energy.Richard Kambinda, acting general manager for TVET and VTC development support, said Zimbabwes capacity in vocational training was impressive and that the visit would help Namibia build stronger foundations for technical education.We came to Zimbabwe on a study tour to see what programmes can help us bridge the gaps we have in Namibia, Kambinda said.We dont have a diamond-cutting college back home, so its important to learn from our brothers and sisters here.
