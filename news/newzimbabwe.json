            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nHARARE residents are opposing the governments plan to roll out prepaid water meters, arguing the move will not solve the citys ongoing water shortages, poor water quality and widespread leakages.\n\nThe government announced plans to install prepaid water meters across the country, starting with the capital city, Harare, to improve water management and responsible use.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, Harare Residents Trust (HRT) accused local authorities of failing to establish a transparent and accountable water management system and argued that this will be another profit-making scheme at the expense of residents.\n\nPrepaid water meters will never help improve the quantity of water delivered to the residents, nor will they address the quality of the water supplied.\n\nGiven the deliberate failure by the local authorities, especially the City of Harare (CoH), to secure a functional, transparent and accountable enterprise resources planning system, it is prudent to initially invest in plugging the leakages and illegal water connections along the water distribution network to reduce non-revenue water.\n\nThe private companies being brought in by the national government to provide the prepaid water meters and be involved in the whole water value chain are interested in profit and not improving service delivery, HRT said.\n\nThe residents trust also accused the government and CoH of quietly signing the deal under a Build-Operate-Transfer model without involving the most affected stakeholders, which are the taxpayers.\n\nThe water infrastructure contract was given to a Hangzhou Liaison Technology Company and Helcraw Electrical Company without going to tender and the contents of the contracts remain unknown to the public.\n\nHelcraw is owned by Zanu PF legislatorfor Murehwa West constituency,Farai Jere.\n\nMeanwhile,HRT urged parliamentary committees to hold public hearings so Zimbabweans can share their views on the water meter policy.\n\nHarare has faced a growing water crisis for years, with daily water supply going downa mix of poor maintenance, pollution and leaking pipes.\n\n",

We are on a mission to check whether there was value for money over the money that the government invested during the COVID-19 era.\n\nAs you are aware, when COVID hit us, we were not prepared, so government released money to various institutions of higher learning for the purposes of producing masks and sanitisers and other stuff that were related to the COVID-19 situation that was prevailing at that particular time.\n\nAfter that, the Auditor General is mandated by the Constitution of Zimbabwe to do a value for money audit just to see whether the resources that were deployed were used properly and whether there was value for money.\n\nSo I must confirm that indeed, from what we have seen, there was value for money. For example, here they received about ZWL$3 million and they managed to grow that ZWL$3 million by 47 times.\n\nHe added, We urge the government to put more resources towards innovation hubs so that we can reduce our import bill as a country, and we will be pointing out those areas in our report when we table the report in Parliament sometime.\n\n",

The funds will be used for a 3-5-day test run of the Zulu Mine, the acquisition of a flotation plant and the settlement of outstanding creditor and staff payments.\n\nThe miner said current stock price reached 0.014 pence, up 18% on Monday afternoon in London.\n\nThe Premier African Minerals Ltd CEO George Roach expressed gratitude to raw materials suppliers for enabling production restart.\n\nThanks to the outstanding support we have received from each of the original equipment manufacturer suppliers associated with all the plant components from the mill to final flotation, we have been able to restart the plant late afternoon on 6 July 2025, he said.\n\nHe said the plant has run with limited feed to allow for checks on the operation of each of the plant components and process integration up to the spodumene cleaner cell inserts that will be brought into the process today once sealants have hardened.\n\nAll being well, ore from the run-of-mine pad will be fed from today and commissioning and optimisation of the primary spodumene flotation plant will follow, added Roach.\n\n",

It is not the City Church Centre. It is the City Sports Centre and it is going to remain that. The City Sports Centre will remain a quintessentially sports facility where people play indoor games and we are going to make it better.\n\nWhen we went to the meeting, the President directed that Prevail Group of Companies assist the Council to renew and modernise that facility and we are going to do exactly that.\n\nThese are the kind of partnerships that we require so that we develop modern facilities that are in keeping with modern day standards and that will make our children grow and live in Harare, said Mafume.\n\nThe deal to revamp the City Sports Centre by Tungwararas company follows a similarly controversial agreement between the council and Geo Pomona, which has taken over refuse collection in the capital.\n\nHarare City Council is also partnering with ZANU PF Member of Parliament Pedzai Scott Sakupwanya for a sports ground he is constructing in Mabvuku and has proposed a lease agreement for Rufaro Stadium.\n\nDespite previously opposing partnerships with private entities, Mafume appears to have softened his stance by endorsing the Geo Pomona and Prevail Group deals.\n\nMafume said partnerships with private players are crucial for the development of the Citys facilities.\n\nA city is build by the Citizens in it. Citizens in it are the cooperates, churches, individuals, NGOs and everybody. We want to encourage people to come and work with us and be in partnership. When we partner with someone there is no way they can put the land in their pocket, said Mafume.\n\nThe City Sports Centre reflects the dire state of council-owned facilities, which have deteriorated due to municipal neglect.\n\nIn 2022, Mafume blocked a proposed deal by businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei to renovate Rufaro Stadium but has since failed to revive the iconic Mbare structure.\n\n",

Upon arrival, they produced the pangolin that was stashed in a black bag inside a crate. Detectives then pounced and the two tried to flee when police revealed their identities, but were swiftly apprehended.\n\nThe pangolin  a female weighing 8.7 kilogrammes was rescued alive and taken to veterinary authorities for medical assessment and care.\n\nIn a statement following sentencing, the National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) said the mandatory nine-year sentence on the two offenders sends a clear message that wildlife crimes are serious offences, and that pangolins are an endangered species.\n\nPangolins are a national treasure, and any attempt to profit from pangolin trafficking will be met with the full force of the law, the NPAZ noted.\n\n",

As a government, we also recognise the various roles you play, the different hats you wear, the responsibilities you carry, and the sacrifices you make, Dinha said.\n\nThe deputy minister stated that her ministry recognised the vital role played by men in shaping their families.\n\nWe acknowledge your never-ending love, your guidance, and your support. You are the pillars of strength that provide stability and security for your families and the nation at large, added the deputy minister.\n\nHowever, because of their roles nature as fathers and employees of the public service, Dinha pointed out that financial stability was crucial for mens well-being.\n\nMens health is a critical issue that contributes to productivity in the organisation.\n\nStress can have devastating effects on mens mental health.\n\nI encourage you to practice stress management techniques such as exercise, being mindful and social support.\n\nI also encourage you to always prioritise your health, seek medical care when needed, and adopt healthy habits despite your busy schedules.\n\nAdded Dinha, To the nation, I call upon us to support men in their roles. Let us celebrate the selfless love, dedication of men and continue to build a society that values and supports men at the workplace and in our homes, she said, urging all men to prioritise their well-being and seek support when needed.\n\nDue to the economic hardships in Zimbabwe, most men are struggling to cope with the day-to-day provision of family needs and many of them have been affected.\n\nSpeaking at the same occasion, Mens Clinic International Marketing manager Philip Jonhera said research had shown that men have poor health-seeking behaviour, hence they should focus on medical check-ups focusing especially prostate cancer which is affecting young men in their thirties.\n\nThere is your spiritual health, there is your physical health, and there is your mental health, if you do not balance all three sections, I wont balance the diet, he said.\n\n",
