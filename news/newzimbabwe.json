            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nDESPITE several cases having been reported on human-wildlife conflict resulting in death and injury countrywide over the years, it is sad to note that Zimbabwe still lacks policy on compensation for those affected.\n\nEnvironment Minister Evelyn Ndlovu last week told the Senate, through a ministerial statement, that until the Parks and Wildlife Amendment Bill went through Parliament, government was incapacitated to to come up with any programme regarding compensation for victims.Every month, cases of wild animals attacking people are being reported and some have lost lives whilst others got permanent injuries but there have been no policy or law to effect compensation.It is important to note that Zimbabwe currently lacks a formal nationwide policy on compensation, until the Bill goes through Parliament and through the Senate, we are incapacitated to come up with a programme.This compensation fund, is relief for the loss of human life due to human-wildlife conflict, will only be developed once the Act is passed through Senate and is gazetted, Ndlovu said.She said CAMPFIRE districts instead, were using local mechanisms to assist victims with funeral and medical expenses and some districts extend support to victims children by paying school fees.The government, through a November 2022 Cabinet Resolution and the August 2023 SONA announcement by President Emmerson Mnangagwa was committed to establishing the Human-Wildlife Conflict Relief Fund.The Parks and Wildlife Bill, which is in the final stages in the House, is intended to provide the legal framework for this fund.Through specific funding, although specific funding mechanisms are yet to be determined, once enacted, the Bill will enable relief for victims in cases of death, injury, maiming and hospitalisation resulting from wildlife conflict, said the minister.However, Ndlovu stated relief was not expected to extend to livestock predation and crop damage at this initial phase.She highlighted: This legislative change is a significant step in addressing relief for the affected communities, as we seek to incorporate relief for crop damage and livestock predation in the near future.Recommendation number five, the Minister of Tourism and Hospitality Industry, through ZimParks authorities, should consider to raise the elephant quota per year from the current three to a minimum of 10 elephants per year for the communities co-existing with wildlife.The minister submitted that the recommendation was from the Environment Parliamentary Committee and ZimParks took note of the recommendation to increase the elephant management quota for communities co-existing with the wildlife.Ndlovu undertook to act on the recommendation.\n\nEnvironment Minister

            "content": "By Jennifer Cartwright\n\nA LEEDS-based charity has launched a BBC Radio 4 Appeal to help tackle a crisis affecting over 50% of Zimbabwean children: the lack of a birth certificate.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Educational Trust, a charity which was founded in 1987 by Vuli Mkandla, an educator from Zimbabwe who moved to Leeds, work with grassroots organisations in Zimbabwe to deliver education-focused projects for marginalised young people.\n\nTheir appeal, named Exist to Exist  Every Childs Right to Be Seen, aims to shine a light on how families are denied basic rights because of missing paperwork.\n\nAccording to UNICEF, only 49% of births in Zimbabwe are registered.\n\nWithout a birth certificate, people in Zimbabwe can be denied access to basic rights including healthcare and education.\n\nAndrew Jackson, Zimbabwe Educational Trust Operational Manager said: Birth registration is one of the biggest issues of our time within Africa and significantly within Zimbabwe. Around half of the entire population and children under five in Zimbabwe are not registered.\n\nTheres a myriad of reasons why but it is an absolute block to human rights.\n\nDerrik Mkandla, Chair of Trustees at the Zimbabwe Educational Trust also highlighted that without a birth certificate, Zimbabweans cannot access a national ID which means they cannot vote, access legal work, or obtain a passport.\n\nHe said: In Zimbabwe you need a birth certificate to get your national ID. Without your national ID, you effectively dont exist.\n\nThe issue not only affects children. Often, parents of unregistered children in Zimbabwe are also unregistered themselves.\n\nSince 2011, the Zimbabwe Educational Trust has been working with Trinity Project, a grassroots organisation in Zimbabwe, to help people gain legal identification. Together, theyve supported 7,700 children and 2,600 adults to gain access to birth registration.\n\nTheir work has focused on covering hidden costs of registration such as transport and legal advice, and educating communities on the importance of registration.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Educational Trust have now launched an appeal on BBC Radio 4 to raise awareness of the issue and fundraise to increase support the Zimbabwe Educational Trust and Trinity Project can provide.\n\nThe appeal, which is voiced by Zimbabwean-born international speaker, author, and human rights advocate Africa Brooke, will be available to listen to on BBC Sounds until September 21. Theyll also be able to hear a live broadcast on September 18 at 3:27pm.\n\nThe appeal is presented by Zimbabwean-born international speaker, author, and human rights advocate Africa Brook\n\nIf listeners wish to make a donation to the Zimbabwe Educational Trust, they can do so by phone, cheque, or online.\n\nDerrick said: Youd never think that birth registration would be an issue.\n\nHere, people take birth certificates for granted. I hope that (this campaign) raises awareness of the challenges that people face that people just dont think about here.\n\nThe BBC Radio 4 Appeal shares the story of Precious, a mother of six. When she took two of her children to hospital for malnutrition, an issue quickly became apparent: none of her children had birth certificates.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Educational Trust and Trinity Project worked together to assign Precious a Case Officer who helped provide legal advice and accompanied Previous to the registration office.\n\nTragically, the help came too late for one of Precious sons, named Needmore, who died at just two years old from malnutrition.\n\nPrecious surviving children now have birth certificates thanks to the work of the Zimbabwe Educational Trust and Trinity Project\n\nExist to Exist  Every Childs Right to Be Seen is an appeal which aims to raise UK awareness of this issue and show people how they can help.\n\nAndrew said: We hope that this campaign gives us the momentum and resources to help some of the most vulnerable children and families to have a fair shot in life.\n\n",

            "content": "By Karabo Ngoepe l Sunday Independent\n\nZIMBABWES politics has once again been dragged into the shadows of intrigue, poison, coup whispers and factional bloodletting.At the centre are President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his deputy, General Constantino Chiwenga, whose rivalry has broken out of State House backrooms and into the public arena. The result: a ruling party on edge and a nation watching nervously.For months, rumours have swirled about mysterious deaths among senior security officials, alleged purges to weaken Chiwengas military base and consolidate Mnangagwas hold on power.The speculation has been amplified by Blessed Runesu Geza, better known as Bombshell Geza. A war veteran turned YouTuber, expelled from Zanu-PF, Geza has reinvented himself as a digital provocateur, openly backing Chiwenga while branding Mnangagwa as corrupt, illegitimate, and destined to be toppled by a coup.This mix of propaganda, mistrust, and succession politics has created a volatile cocktail at the heart of the Zimbabwean state.The most sensational allegation is that General Anselem Sanyatwe, once Head of the Defence Forces and now Sports Minister, was poisoned. His fall from military command to a low-key cabinet role has long been seen as Mnangagwas attempt to cut Chiwengas influence.The story now doing the rounds is darker. Social media posts allege that Kudakwashe Queen Bee Tagwirei, Mnangagwas financier and ally, masterminded a poisoning plot against Sanyatwe. The claims say he was injected with a toxic substance at a public event in Nyanga before being flown to India for emergency treatment.Neither Sanyatwe nor his office has confirmed the claims. Instead, insiders insist his trip abroad was for ongoing medical care. He has been unwell for some time. His deployment back from Tanzania and later his removal from the army were linked to his health, one source told this publication.When he became Sports Minister, his condition worsened. He spent two months in India for treatment. He spent at least two months there and was not seen in the cabinet. It was a closely guarded secret, but detractors tried to cook up some rumours when he was there that his deployment to sports was a demotion and that he was boycotting meetings. That is not true; he was attending to his health. The rumours that he was poisoned in Nyanga are not true, the source said.The insider added that it was sad to see his health being used for cheap politicking. But in Zimbabwean politics, facts often matter less than perception. Poison stories have long been part of the playbook, from Mugabe-era whispers to Mnangagwas own alleged poisoning in 2017. They serve to terrify, to discredit, and to fracture alliances.For Chiwengas camp, the Sanyatwe narrative paints Mnangagwas circle as ruthless power-hunters. For Mnangagwas loyalists, it looks like a manufactured smear designed to drive a wedge between the president and the military.The rumours also target Tagwirei himself. Long seen as Mnangagwas banker, he was formally inducted into the Zanu-PF Central Committee in August 2025. That move cemented his shift from shadow financier to open political player.His sudden rise has unsettled Zanu-PFs liberation war veterans and the military elite. They view him as a civilian outsider with money but no liberation credentials, a figure Mnangagwa could be grooming as a successor or at least a kingmaker. For Chiwenga, who has always believed the presidency is his birthright, Tagwireis ascent is a direct challenge.Against this backdrop, poisoning allegations serve a purpose. They are less about proving what happened to Sanyatwe than about casting Tagwirei and Mnangagwa as untrustworthy usurpers, men willing to turn on allies to secure power.Into this combustible mix steps Geza. His YouTube rants, laced with military nostalgia and coup fantasies, have transformed Zanu-PFs succession fight into a digital street brawl. He portrays the army as Zimbabwes only salvation and Mnangagwa as a usurper, hinting openly that only a military takeover can restore order.Some see him as a brave whistleblower; others as a reckless agitator. But his influence is undeniable. His talk of carnage in the security forces has struck a chord with Zimbabweans long convinced that power is decided not at the ballot box, but in the barracks.Zimbabwe has walked this road before. Poison allegations, coup whispers, factional purges, they are the recurring features of its politics. But with Mnangagwa, now 82, the stakes are higher than ever. Succession is no longer theoretical.Poisoning rumours are not about evidence, one Harare-based analyst said.They are about perception. And in Zimbabwean succession politics, perception is power.Each whisper erodes trust. Each online rant widens the rift. Each allegation feeds paranoia in the barracks and boardrooms alike. This is how factional battles metastasise into national crises.The MnangagwaChiwenga rivalry will shape Zimbabwes next chapter. History suggests Zimbabwes succession fights rarely end quietly. The poison stories and coup whispers are not mere gossip; they are early warning signs.\n\nZIMBABWES politics has once again been dragged into the shadows of intrigue, poison, coup whispers and factional bloodletting.At the centre are President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his deputy, General Constantino Chiwenga, whose rivalry has broken out of State House backrooms and into the public arena.

His YouTube rants, laced with military nostalgia and coup fantasies, have transformed Zanu-PFs succession fight into a digital street brawl. He portrays the army as Zimbabwes only salvation and Mnangagwa as a usurper, hinting openly that only a military takeover can restore order.Some see him as a brave whistleblower; others as a reckless agitator. But his influence is undeniable. His talk of carnage in the security forces has struck a chord with Zimbabweans long convinced that power is decided not at the ballot box, but in the barracks.Zimbabwe has walked this road before. Poison allegations, coup whispers, factional purges, they are the recurring features of its politics. But with Mnangagwa, now 82, the stakes are higher than ever. Succession is no longer theoretical.Poisoning rumours are not about evidence, one Harare-based analyst said.They are about perception. And in Zimbabwean succession politics, perception is power.Each whisper erodes trust. Each online rant widens the rift. Each allegation feeds paranoia in the barracks and boardrooms alike. This is how factional battles metastasise into national crises.The MnangagwaChiwenga rivalry will shape Zimbabwes next chapter. History suggests Zimbabwes succession fights rarely end quietly. The poison stories and coup whispers are not mere gossip; they are early warning signs.\n\nZIMBABWES politics has once again been dragged into the shadows of intrigue, poison, coup whispers and factional bloodletting.\n\nAt the centre are President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his deputy, General Constantino Chiwenga, whose rivalry has broken out of State House backrooms and into the public arena. The result: a ruling party on edge and a nation watching nervously.For months, rumours have swirled about mysterious deaths among senior security officials, alleged purges to weaken Chiwengas military base and consolidate Mnangagwas hold on power.The speculation has been amplified by Blessed Runesu Geza, better known as Bombshell Geza. A war veteran turned YouTuber, expelled from Zanu-PF, Geza has reinvented himself as a digital provocateur, openly backing Chiwenga while branding Mnangagwa as corrupt, illegitimate, and destined to be toppled by a coup.This mix of propaganda, mistrust, and succession politics has created a volatile cocktail at the heart of the Zimbabwean state.The most sensational allegation is that General Anselem Sanyatwe, once Head of the Defence Forces and now Sports Minister, was poisoned. His fall from military command to a low-key cabinet role has long been seen as Mnangagwas attempt to cut Chiwengas influence.The story now doing the rounds is darker. Social media posts allege that Kudakwashe Queen Bee Tagwirei, Mnangagwas financier and ally, masterminded a poisoning plot against Sanyatwe. The claims say he was injected with a toxic substance at a public event in Nyanga before being flown to India for emergency treatment.Neither Sanyatwe nor his office has confirmed the claims. Instead, insiders insist his trip abroad was for ongoing medical care. He has been unwell for some time. His deployment back from Tanzania and later his removal from the army were linked to his health, one source told this publication.When he became Sports Minister, his condition worsened. He spent two months in India for treatment. He spent at least two months there and was not seen in the cabinet. It was a closely guarded secret, but detractors tried to cook up some rumours when he was there that his deployment to sports was a demotion and that he was boycotting meetings. That is not true; he was attending to his health. The rumours that he was poisoned in Nyanga are not true, the source said.The insider added that it was sad to see his health being used for cheap politicking. But in Zimbabwean politics, facts often matter less than perception. Poison stories have long been part of the playbook, from Mugabe-era whispers to Mnangagwas own alleged poisoning in 2017. They serve to terrify, to discredit, and to fracture alliances.For Chiwengas camp, the Sanyatwe narrative paints Mnangagwas circle as ruthless power-hunters. For Mnangagwas loyalists, it looks like a manufactured smear designed to drive a wedge between the president and the military.The rumours also target Tagwirei himself. Long seen as Mnangagwas banker, he was formally inducted into the Zanu-PF Central Committee in August 2025. That move cemented his shift from shadow financier to open political player.His sudden rise has unsettled Zanu-PFs liberation war veterans and the military elite. They view him as a civilian outsider with money but no liberation credentials, a figure Mnangagwa could be grooming as a successor or at least a kingmaker.

This turnaround will be driven by vibrant and strategic sectors such as agriculture, mining, and manufacturing, which continue to form the backbone of our economic resurgence and transformation, he said.Last year, Zimbabwes economy recorded a growth of 2 percent due to the impact of an El Nino-induced drought and energy shortages.\n\nThe higher projection is on account of more than anticipated output in the agricultural sector, particularly tobacco, following favorable climatic conditions and mining sector growth buoyed by high commodity prices, notably gold, Ncube said at a business conference in Bulawayo, the second largest city in Zimbabwe.\n\nTobacco and gold are Zimbabwes largest agricultural and mineral exports, serving as major foreign currency earners for the southern African country.Ncube noted that despite global headwinds and exogenous shocks, including climate change, commodity price fluctuations, and energy supply constraints, Zimbabwes economy remains resilient.In 2025 and beyond, our economy is poised for a strong recovery and sustained growth following the drought-induced slowdown we experienced in 2024.
