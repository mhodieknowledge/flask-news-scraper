            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nOutspoken former legislator Temba Mliswa has lashed out at Presidential Spokesperson George Charamba, accusing him of mishandling the controversy surrounding the planned but ultimately failed October 17 protests called by war veteran Blessed Geza.\n\nAhead of the protests, a fake statement purportedly from Vice President (Rtd) Constantino Chiwenga condemning the demonstrations circulated on social media.\n\nCharamba responded by emphasising the misuse of government stationery, while admitting that the letter carried a well-intentioned message.\n\nAbuse of government stationery: Kindly note that the message below, however well-intentioned, has been pasted on government stationery, without the knowledge, involvement, or sanction of the Department of Presidential Communications, to which the original stationery belongs, Charamba posted on his X account.\n\nMliswa, however, accused Charamba of deliberately deflecting attention from the more pressing issue,the protests themselves.\n\nHis solution was to evade the greater matter of the contents of the letter and instead lavish disproportionate amounts of self-righteous anger on the abuse of government stationery, Mliswa wrote on X on Thursday.\n\nHe added that Charambas response betrayed his palaver with power on both ends,for now with ED and for the future with a clique embedded within the system.\n\nPeople were worried about the demonstration and messages around it more than that paper! His failure to leverage on this ended up as a sanctioning of the demonstration, he said.\n\nMliswa also questioned Charambas apparent reluctance to strongly denounce the planned protests, saying this was out of character for a Presidential Spokesperson.\n\nAnyone familiar with his conduct and antics through his multiple ghost accounts could clearly pick out the dragging of feet. While cause existed to restrain abuse of government communication channels, an even greater cause of existential importance called for more. He offered none! he said.\n\nMliswa further accused Charamba of acting like a social media bully, using pseudo accounts to attack opponents,behavior he said was unbecoming of a Presidential Spokesperson and damaging to President Emmerson Mnangagwas image.\n\nOver time, as DCS, he has simply become a wild bully without professional decorum in public engagements, encapsulated by incessant insults of Dununu against any contrary thought or individual.\n\nIts shocking behaviour for someone who is the Presidential Spokesperson and should have drawn government censure long ago, as it brings the President and the Office into disrepute. The absence of such has seemingly emboldened him to grow even coarser into the grating maverick around whom many tiptoe, fearful of getting a revolting rant.\n\nWe cant have a Presidential Spokesperson who is toxic and personal in his engagements, tarnishing the name and standing of the President. These are the kinds of things which the Chief Secretary should bring to the President, Mliswa added.\n\nMliswas criticism comes shortly after he accused Charamba of sleeping on duty, claiming exiled former minister Jonathan Moyo was doing a better job defending Mnangagwa on the controversial 2030 presidential term limit debate.\n\nIn response to the repeated attacks, Charamba dismissed Mliswa as irrelevant, saying he was not worth engaging.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nGOVERNMENT has set aside nearly US$197,000 to cover the medical and repatriation costs for Zimbabwean victims of the Limpopo bus accident, which killed 44.\n\nThe victims, Zimbabweans and Malawians, were travelling back home when the DNC bus veered off the N1 North near Louis Trichardt on 13 October, killing 43 passengers and injuring 40 others, the victims. One more person succumbed to injuries in the hospital, bringing the death toll to 44.\n\n36 Zimbabweans died and 13 remain hospitalised in South Africa, with three in a critical condition.\n\nPreliminary investigations have revealed that the accident was due to brake failure and overloading of the bus, which was carrying 91 passengers with only a 62-seater capacity.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has since declared the bus accident a national disaster.\n\nPresenting a ministerial statement in the National Assembly recently, the Deputy Minister of Local Government and Public Works, Benjamin Kabikira, said the repatriation will be conducted in batches beginning on Friday.\n\nThe positive identification of all deceased was completed on the 20th of October, 2025, with the ZRP forensic team present to assist with the fingerprint screening and verification. In cases involving deceased children, DNA samples were collected from both the deceased and their next of kin for accurate identification.\n\nThen, on the death registration and documentation, all required documentation, including the death certificates and burial orders, are being processed to facilitate repatriation.\n\nThe repatriation to Zimbabwe is anticipated to begin in batches from Friday, 24th October 2025, pending the completion of all formal processes. A mass memorial service will be held in Beitbridge when the bodies arrive in Zimbabwe, said Kabikira.\n\nKabikira added that US$197,000 has been set aside to assist the victims.\n\nSecondly, we have dispatched a bus with next of kin or relatives from the National Disaster Management Centre, Harare, to the Beitbridge route to South Africa, for identification of the bodies. Zimbabwean nationals, that is next of kin without valid passports, were granted temporary passage into South Africa for the sole purpose of identifying the deceased.\n\nA list of names for the next of kin and national IDs was submitted to South African Immigration in advance to ensure smooth border processing. As a Ministry, post mortems were completed on Friday, the 17th of October, 2025 and the physical identification was also completed as of 20 October at Siloam Hospital.\n\nAs an intervention, the department of Civil Protection requested the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development and Zim Borders for a waiver of border charges for the hearses and bus carrying the bodies and families of the bereaved. The budget for intervention and coordination of the disaster is as follows: We are anticipating using a total amount of US$197,940 or ZWG5,340,930. 3 in the coordination and intervention of the disaster, said Kabikira.\n\n",

            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo, IOL\n\nThe Road Accident Fund (RAF) has confirmed thatvictims and families affected by the Limpopo bus disaster that killed and injured dozens of Zimbabwean and Malawian nationalsare entitled to lodge claims for compensation  but theres a legal catch that could determine who actually gets paid.\n\nResponding to IOL, the RAF said that while all victims of the tragic DNC Coaches crash near Makhado have the right to apply for compensation under the Road Accident Fund Act, any potential payouts will depend on the outcome of investigations and on each claimants legal status in South Africa.\n\nVictims and/or families of last weeks bus crash in Limpopo are entitled to lodge claims according to the Road Accident Fund Act, [but] each claim will still have to be assessed on its own merit, the RAF told IOL.\n\nIt is not accurate that the RAF is liable for all or any accidents. Before the RAF can be liable, there must be an establishment of the fact that the accident was wrongfully caused.\n\nThe bus, which was travelling from Gqeberha (Port Elizabeth) to Harare, plunged off an embankment near Makhado (Louis Trichardt) on 12 October, killing more than 40 people and leaving many passengers critically injured.\n\nThe vehicle was licensed to carry 61 passengers, but investigators from the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) found that it was carrying more than 90 people, mostly Zimbabweans and Malawians returning home.\n\nThe Zimbabwean government has since stepped in to assist its citizens  pledging to repatriate the remains of those who died, cover hospital costs for the injured, and coordinate with South African authorities. Malawian officials are conducting similar efforts to identify and assist their nationals.\n\nThe RAFs intervention comes amid public speculation that the fund is automatically liable for compensation to foreign nationals injured or killed on South African roads.\n\nHowever, the agencys statement makes clear that liability must first be established under Section 3 of the RAF Act, which stipulates that compensation can only be paid for loss or damage wrongfully caused by the driving of a motor vehicle.\n\nThat means that each claim will have to be individually investigated  including who was at fault, whether the driver or bus company was negligent, and whether the vehicle was legally roadworthy.\n\nUntil the claims are lodged with the RAF, we implore everyone concerned to allow the relevant authorities to conclude their investigations before any pronouncements are made on the liability of the RAF, the Fund told IOL.\n\nThe RAF also introduced a crucial legal caveat that could prevent some victims  particularly those without valid documentation  from receiving compensation.\n\nThe RAF as an organ of state is obliged to comply with section 42 of the Immigration Act, which prohibits the aiding and abetting of illegal foreigners, the Fund said.\n\nWhere the RAFs liability is established, the payment of compensation must not contravene any other law such as the Immigration Act.\n\nIn practice, this means that while foreign nationals are not excluded from lodging claims, undocumented migrants may face legal barriers if their compensation would be deemed to aid or abet an illegal presence in the country.\n\nLegal experts say this clause could become a flashpoint in the coming weeks, as lawyers for victims test whether the RAF can lawfully withhold payments based on immigration status.\n\nDespite its legal caution, the RAF extended condolences to those affected, saying it sympathizes with the families of those injured and deceased in the accident and pledges to support them through the claims process.\n\nThe agency urged survivors and families to make contact through its call centre (087 820 1111), WhatsApp line (071 605 4707), or emailcontactcentre@raf.co.za.\n\nThe Limpopo tragedy has reignited debate about the rights of foreign nationals in South Africa  especially when it comes to access to public compensation funds.\n\nAnti-immigrant groups have criticised the idea of South African taxpayers compensating non-citizens, while rights advocates argue that the RAFs mandate applies to all persons injured or killed on South African roads, regardless of nationality.\n\nThe outcome of the Limpopo case could set an important legal and moral precedent, testing the intersection of immigration law, human rights, and public compensation.\n\nAuthorities from the Road Traffic Management Corporation and Limpopo Transport Departmentare continuing investigations into the crash. Early findings point to excessive speed, overloading, and poor vehicle maintenance as likely contributing factors.\n\nFor now, survivors and families are being advised to gather identity documents, medical records, and accident reports to prepare their claims  a process that could take months to resolve.\n\n",

            "content": "By Takudzwa Nyambi, Glamour South Africa\n\nOver the past few years weve witnessed a renaissance on the continent when it comes to African culture and creativity. Fashion houses reference Accra streetwear in Paris runways. Amapiano is the unofficial soundtrack of Berlin clubs. Nollywood stars are headlining Netflix features.\n\nAccording to a 2023 UNESCO report, Africas film and audiovisual sector already employs around five million people and generates $5 billion annually. With proper investment, the broader cultural and creative industries could pull in $20 billion a year and create 20 million jobs. This is soft power and real economic transformation.\n\nAfricas creative future wont be written in isolation. Marcus Garvey once envisioned a global Black network, the diaspora and continent working hand in hand. A century later, that vision is finding its feet in people like Fungai Zvirawa, the Zimbabwean advertising executive who built her chops in London boardrooms only to bring them back to Harare, determined to stitch together a local industry that could stand tall on the global stage.\n\nI was raised in South East London by two fiercely patriotic Zimbabwean parents, she recalls. Like many immigrants, I had my share of go back to your country. But instead of breaking me, those words reminded me that I did have a country. That sense of belonging became her compass. The moment crystallized in 2002 when she watched Robert Mugabe address the UN. Politics aside, his message of sovereignty and youth empowerment struck something deep within me. It was a reminder I had a home, a heritage, and a responsibility.\n\nAfter nearly three decades abroad, Fungai Zvirawa returned, stumbling at first, but eventually planting firm roots. It took me four attempts as a returnee to really break ground, she admits. There have been incredible wins and an equal share of losses, but thats the reality of building in Africa. She shares about keeping it simple, embracing culture, and resisting the urge to impose a foreign mindset.\n\nThat mindset birthed Khaya Defero, her cultural events company, and Rogue & Associates, her boutique ad agency. Khaya Defero has staged RSVP, AGW, The Big Chill, and Zimdaba, experiences designed to elevate the very idea of what Zimbabwean hospitality and show business could look like. When I began curating events in Harare, I realised there was no real separation between the celebrity and fan, no true culture of hospitality that elevated talent. Through these platforms, we changed that.\n\nShes also helped shepherd multi-award-winning talents like Shingai and ShaSha, bridging the tricky gap between diaspora fame and local relevance. Many artists who succeed abroad struggle to reconnect at home. The balance is always authenticity, keeping Zimbabwean creativity intact, while packaging it in ways that resonate globally and locally.\n\nThat same dual vision threads through her leadership roles as President of the Zimbabwe Association of Accredited Practitioners in Advertising (ZAAPA) and CEO of the Zimbabwe Music Awards (ZIMA). For her, the two industries arent as far apart as people assume. Advertising and music are two sides of the same coin. In advertising, we shape narratives that move markets. In music, we shape narratives that move people.\n\nIf that sounds like the voice of a seasoned operator, its because Zvirawa has been navigating and leading in male-dominated spaces for decades. When you show up prepared, deliver, and stay true to your values, respect eventually follows, even if it takes longer than it should.\n\nWhat makes her tick is the idea of rebranding Zimbabwe through creativity. Zimbabwes greatest resource is its people and their creativity. Im in the business of exporting that, our music, our ideas, our artistry. Its a project both ambitious and pragmatic to put Zimbabwean work in front of global audiences, and watch assumptions shift.\n\nIn her next chapter, Zvirawa is betting on technology as a force for transformation. She has invested in Black Mobile, a Pan-African mobile value-added services company with a footprint in Zimbabwe, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Botswana, and Zambia.\n\nFor me, this is about future-proofing Africas creative economy. Our artists, brands, and storytellers need platforms that are homegrown, designed with our realities at the core, yet powerful enough to scale globally. Black Mobile represents that opportunity.\n\n",

Despite several capital-raising efforts earlier in 2025, the company still faces a funding gap needed to complete the next phase of development at its Zulu project.\n\nThe failure to secure this additional funding could significantly impact both the Zulu Lithium Project and the overall financial health of the company, Premier said in a Regulatory News Service (RNS) announcement issued on October 21.\n\nAt an Extraordinary General Meeting (EGM), shareholders will vote on whether to approve a discounted open offer as the primary means of raising the required capital. However, Premier cautioned that it cannot guarantee the offer will be fully subscribed or that alternative financing options will be available on favourable terms.\n\nSince launching the project in 2023, Premier has made notable progress, including the establishment of a lithium concentrate production plant. However, it missed its target to ship the first spodumene concentrate to Canmax Technologies by March 2023, leading the company to declare force majeure. Canmax, which had provided US$35 million in financing for the plant, contested the declaration, but the two later reached a settlement.\n\nThe project has continued to face challenges during its fourth production phase, primarily due to funding constraints that have affected maintenance and procurement of essential spare parts.\n\nPremier now requires US$6.2 million to complete pre-production preparations and advance the project to full commercial production.\n\nShareholder support for the upcoming resolutions is of utmost importance to avoid jeopardising the future of the Zulu Project and the companys financial viability, the company said.\n\nThe Zulu Lithium and Tantalum Project forms part of Premiers broader strategy to capitalise on surging global demand for lithium,a key mineral used in rechargeable batteries for electric vehicles (EVs), smartphones, laptops, and renewable energy storage systems.\n\n",
