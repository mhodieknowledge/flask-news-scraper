            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said it would like to see the ZiG fully becoming a national currency, as it weighs whether to place Zimbabwe on a staff-monitored program.\n\nThe ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, succeeded the Zimbabwean dollar in April 2024 after multiple crashes. Its the countrys sixth attempt since 2009 to replace the dollar as the southern African nations main transacting currency, but is yet to succeed.\n\nSeveral measures will need to be adopted to boost ZiG usage, including deepening the foreign-exchange market to ensure full price discovery, said Wojciech Maliszewski, the Washington-based lenders mission chief, who is in Zimbabwe to review its request for a new SMP. The nations last program ended abruptly in 2019 after the central bank printed money that fueled the collapse of the local currency.\n\nRight now we see good stability in the official market and we also see a convergence between the parallel and official rate, he told reporters Monday after meeting Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa in the capital, Harare. Ideally, we would like to see an elimination of this gap, we would like to see one exchange rate.\n\nStill, the ZiGs 43% devaluation in September to narrow the gap between the official and unofficial rate and its inconvertibility has led citizens to favor dollars.\n\nThe ZiG traded little changed on Tuesday at 26.96 against the dollar and exchanged hands at 32 to 35 on the parallel market.\n\nThe Washington-based lender said it isnt pushing for more exchange rate depreciation but for the two rates to converge supported by government fiscal discipline.\n\nThere is a good chance that these rates will converge, Maliszewski said.\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncube last month at the annual meetings of the African Development Bank said he expected the SMP to be finalized by the end of June. The program would bring Zimbabwe closer toward revamping its $21 billion debt pile with creditors that want assurances that its authorities are pursuing prudent fiscal and monetary policies.\n\n",

We are forced toimprovise daily just to preserve life. But we cannot continue like this. The systemhas failed, and the suffering is unbearable.\n\nWe call on the government of Zimbabwe to urgently prioritise the health sector.Equip hospitals. Support nurses. Save lives. This situation must be addressedwithout delay, Dongo said.\n\nDongo also said public hospitals do not have blankets for patients in this winter season andsome wards do not have windows.\n\nFacilities are deteriorating fast. There are no blankets in many wards as weapproach winter. Some hospitals do not even have proper windows.\n\nX-ray departments are not functioning. Diagnostic centres are almost non-existent.Basic lab services are unavailable.\n\nNurses are unable to conduct essential tests, and the sick are being referred to private hospitals that they cannot afford. They remain in public wards, in pain, waiting, suffering, Dongo added.\n\nRecently, Health Minister Douglas Mombeshora admitted that Zimbabwes biggest referral public hospital, Parirenyatwa, is in a bad state after a tour following a public outcry.\n\nThe situation at Parirenyatwa is a reflection of all public hospitals in the country.\n\nOver the years, health workers have submitted numerous petitions and staged protests calling for urgent government intervention; however, the authorities have taken little to no action.\n\n",

            "content": "The Star\n\nA memorial service for Zambias former President Edgar Chagwa Lungu is being held Tuesday at the Cathedral in Pretoria, South Africa, under a cloud of political tension and unresolved conflict between his family and the Zambian government.\n\nMourners, including members of the Patriotic Front (PF), Lungus former ruling party, filled the cathedral as emotional tributes were paid to the late statesman.\n\nHowever, the atmosphere was not one of peace.\n\nInstead, it reflected the deepening rift over Lungus legacy, his cause of death, and the governments controversial handling of his passing.\n\nThe 68-year-old former president died last Thursday in a South African hospital, where he had been undergoing treatment for an undisclosed illness.\n\nSince his death, speculation and accusations have surfaced, with some PF leaders claiming Lungu may have been poisoned  a charge the Zambian government has not addressed publicly.\n\nAccording to hospital sources, government officials allegedly tried to repatriate Lungus body to Zambia without the familys consent.\n\nMedical staff say they were intimidated and threatened, prompting outrage from PF leaders and human rights groups alike.\n\nSpeaking at a media roundtable in Sandton, Johannesburg, PF Secretary General Mangani Nakacinda condemned the governments actions, calling them a calculated political manoeuvre to seize control of the narrative. Nakacinda added,\n\nThis is no longer just about mourning a former president  it is about defending his dignity and our democracy.\n\nOne of the most contentious issues is the Zambian governments reported insistence on taking full control of Lungus funeral arrangements.\n\nThe Lungu family, backed by PF allies, has resisted this, citing concerns about trust and transparency. So far, the standoff has stalled any official state funeral plans.\n\nAdding to the pain and confusion, two of Lungus children were allegedly denied permission to leave Zambia to attend their fathers memorial in South Africa. Family representatives say the travel ban is another example of the administrations deliberate cruelty.\n\nInside Zambia, the situation is increasingly volatile. PF members have vowed to fight until the end to expose what they claim is a campaign to erase Lungus political legacy and prevent scrutiny into the events leading to his death.\n\nMeanwhile, the government appears determined to maintain authority over the funeral process, citing protocol and national interest.\n\nThe late presidents political comeback in 2023 had reignited tensions in the country. After years of relative silence, Lungu announced his intention to run in the 2026 elections, challenging the ruling United Party for National Development (UPND) and its leader, President Hakainde Hichilema.\n\nIn response, the Constitutional Court ruled him ineligible, sparking legal and political protests.Shortly after, Lungu was stripped of all state benefits, including security and medical support, further isolating him.\n\nPF leaders claim these actions left him vulnerable, even hindering access to vital medical treatment in the months before his death.\n\nAs his body remains in South Africa and legal negotiations continue behind the scenes, todays memorial has become more than a moment of remembrance  it is a flashpoint in a deepening national crisis.\n\nThe treatment of former President Lungu is a reflection of the state of our democracy, said Brian Mundubile, a senior PF figure.\n\nThis is about justice, truth, and respect  not just for him, but for all Zambians.With the cause of Lungus death still unconfirmed and calls for an independent investigation growing louder, todays service may not be the end of mourning but the beginning of a prolonged battle for answers.\n\n",
