The Ministry acknowledges that no contractor is on site, as the tender process is still ongoing, the statement reads.\n\nThe permanent secretary said the error was due to a breach of internal protocol caused by their social media officer, who failed to verify the information.\n\nAdded Makumbe, One of the officers assigned the duty to manage the Ministrys Twitter handle conceded and acknowledged that she breached the internal Standard Operating Procedures for information verification by not verifying the authenticity of the facts with the technical officials in the Department of Roads before posting.\n\nThe Ministry stated that an evaluation committee will now review the bids before submitting its recommendations to the Special Procurement Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Ministry wishes to set the record straight on the matter as follows: the tender which was issued on April 17, 2025, closed on April 29, 2025, at 11:00 hours.\n\nAfter the closure of the bidding period, an evaluation committee will convene, whereupon the outcome will be sent to the Special Procurement Oversight Committee for oversight of the tender process before awarding the same to successful bidders, said Makumbe.\n\nThe reconstruction of the entire road is set to take 36 months, according to the Minister of Transport, Felix Mhona.

Such behaviour has no place in society and media specifically, where voices should uplift, not degrade. Moja Love (DStv 157) as a platform is committed to fostering a respectful and inclusive environment. We refuse to stay silent.\n\nMisogyny on air doesnt only harm the individuals targeted, it perpetuates a toxic culture that normalises the dehumanisation of women. Yesterday we took a firm stance against this conduct, and we will continue to challenge such rhetoric whenever it arises. Media is designed to shape societal norms, and with that influence comes responsibility. To MacG and others who use their platforms carelessly: accountability is not optional. We urge audiences and broadcasters alike to reject sexist vitriol and demand better. Respect isnt a privilege, its a right.\n\nThe channel has also received flack for airing a recent episode of the reality showIsencane Lengane.\n\nThe show, in its seventh season, which follows the lives of Siyacela Dlamuka and Thando Msomi, who married when they were teenagers,sparked outrage among viewers, with many raising concerns about the couples toxicity.\n\nAccording to Moja Love,Isencane Lenganeis designed to contribute to the discourse on gender-based violence and societal ills, with the aim of raising awareness and promoting positive change.\n\nMoja Love said they are committed to providing psychological support to affected members, including Thando, who was affected by events depicted in the show, and would continue to offer support.\n\nIt is important to note the show is a reality show which reflects, explores and raises awareness and contributes to the discourse on gender-based violence and societal ills. The channel has through many of its social justice programmes played a pivotal role in shaping discourse and contributing positively in society, read thestatement.\n\n",

She would contact potential victims, sometimes through intermediaries, offering the opportunity for enrollment in training programs.\n\nIn one instance, she contacted a prophetess claiming to be grateful for past prayers and used this connection to offer the fraudulent training opportunity. The offender would then request money from the victims, purportedly for training expenses, accommodation, and uniforms.\n\nThese payments were made through various money transfer methods such as Mojomula, Innbucks, Mukuru, and Ecocash, said the prosecution.\n\nFurthermore, Magazini would promise the victims that their names would be published in state-run newspapers for confirmation of enrollment.\n\nThe offender received the money from the complainants. In some cases, intermediaries were used to collect and consolidate payments from multiple individuals. To maintain the deception, the accused would make false promises, such as claiming that the victims names would be published in official publications like the Herald and Sunday Mail.\n\nWhen victims began to question the legitimacy of the scheme, the offender would make excuses and provide false reassurances.
