            "content": "By Xinhua\n\nTHE increasing presence of Chinese companies is boosting Zimbabwes job market, a Zimbabwean economic analyst said Thursday.\n\nDereck Goto, an economic analyst and political commentator based in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, told Xinhua that the ever-increasing employment opportunities brought by Chinese firms, particularly in the mining sector, also mirror a wider trend of economic engagement between China and Africa.In recent years, Zimbabwe has seen a growing number of Chinese companies that continuously place job advertisements in local media for key positions, indicating their booming interest in local talent.In the short term, the rise in job advertisements represents the setup phase. These firms are hiring essential technical and operational staff to establish a local presence and address immediate project needs, Goto said.Looking ahead, Chinese companies have the potential to become employers of choice, he said, while calling for them to invest more in localization, skills transfer and long-term talent development.In a separate interview, Executive Director of the Southern African Research and Documentation Center Munetsi Madakufamba said that the growth in the number of Chinese companies seeking local professionals was a combination of factors, including the growing Chinese presence in the country and a response to local employment demands.We do need to ensure Zimbabweans have the requisite skills to fully benefit from those opportunities; we need a serious upgrading of local skills to maximize the potential, Madakufamba said.\n\nDereck Goto, an economic analyst and political commentator based in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, told Xinhua that the ever-increasing employment opportunities brought by Chinese firms, particularly in the mining sector, also mirror a wider trend of economic engagement between China and Africa.\n\nIn recent years, Zimbabwe has seen a growing number of Chinese companies that continuously place job advertisements in local media for key positions, indicating their booming interest in local talent.In the short term, the rise in job advertisements represents the setup phase.

Quite a bit, it turns out.\n\nThe Competition and Tariff Commission (CTC) wants the government to slap a 40% safeguard duty on imported toothpaste, saying the flood of cheaper imports is crushing the countrys only local producer, Merken.CTCs investigation, whose results are published in the latest government gazette, found that toothpaste imports more than doubled, up 124%, between 2021 and 2023. That spike came after government lifted duty on imports.Shipments jumped from 1.2 tonnes in 2021 to 2.7 tonnes last year. The result? Merkens market share was squeezed from 2.04% in 2020 to below 1% in 2023, while its capacity utilisation dropped to just 3.39%.The imported products, mostly from South Africa, were up to 40% cheaper than Merkens, above being far more recognised brands than Merken.CTC says this damaged Merken: Other potential factors, including currency volatility and electricity supply challenges, were examined and found not to have materially contributed to the injury.So what did? The Commission points to two main factors, the lifting of import restrictions, and a weak South African rand, which made South African toothpaste even cheaper on Zimbabwean shelves.Its a story that many manufacturers in Zimbabwe will be familiar with; local producers face high costs, and must compete with South African producers, with larger capacities and benefitting from the rand.
