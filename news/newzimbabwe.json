Despitethislarge workforce, the financial system of HCC is in shambles.\n\nHCC Executive Assistant to the Town Clerk, Mathew Marara, admitted before the Commission,chaired by retired Justice Maphios Cheda, that the workforceis excessively large.\n\nEven 300 is bloated. Yes, the percentage that goes towardssalaries each month exceeds the limits that are prescribedby the government, said Marara.\n\nRELATED:\n\nHCC is plaguedby allegations of bad governance and maladministration failing to carry out its mandate.\n\nThe situation is further exacerbated by City Council officials and Councillors who are influencing recruitment, inflating the wage bill at the Town House.\n\nWhat happens is when you come up with the structures for the organisation, departments recommend the number of personnel and type of personnel they require.\n\nThey recommend these to the human capital department and the human capital department writes reports to the Council to recommenda change in the structure of the organisation. It is the Council which authorises the structure which will be implemented, said Marara.\n\nHCC currently has more than 70 drivers responsible for refuse collection, but most of them are idle due to a shortage of vehicles.\n\nMarara said the only solutionis to reduce the number of workers at the HCC.\n\nCouncil needs to undergo a restructuring exercise but this restructuring can not be undertaken by the current council because on a number of occasions we had recommended reduction in numbers but it has not happened. Definitely, the numbers need to be reduced, he said.\n\n",

He has already signed Executive Orders withdrawing the US from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and limiting foreign aid, among others.\n\nEmerging market finance ministers meeting in Davos for the 2025 World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meetings are concerned that this could have implications for their economies and funding flows for critical sectors such as healthcare.\n\nNcube told a media briefing from Davos on Wednesday that he was concerned that higher interest rates and a stronger US dollar emanating from Trumps inward looking policies will hurt emerging market economies and currencies.\n\nHigher interest rates this will keep the USD stronger and we will not be comfortable if USD is too stronger. A strong USD may encourage imports too much which encourages current account deficits for countries like Zimbabwe, he said.\n\nFor emerging markets, explained Ncube, a stronger US dollar will suck liquidity away and hurt emerging market currencies and capital will exit from these economies in search of treasury bills.\n\nThe United States withdrawal from the WHO will likely result in limited funding flows for healthcare programs under the UN agency.\n\nNcube said Zimbabwe and other emerging markets now have to mobilise resources domestically to plug any funding gaps for healthcare.\n\nZimbabwe has implemented various taxes such as a sugar tax, levies on fast foods and on airtime top-ups in addition to an AIDS levy among others.\n\nResources from these statutory collections, said Ncube, would help the government to marshal domestic resources to fund health sector programs and importation of equipment used in cancer treatment.\n\nWe discussed what Trump means for global trade and international relations especially for Africa. One issue we noted was the US pulling out of the WHO  we felt that this perhaps signals reduced support on health front for countries such as Zimbabwe which relies on PEPFAR funding for HIV programs, said Ncube.\n\nThe withdrawal by US from the WHO means that Zimbabwe has to scale up our funding for health through taxes such as sugar taxes, and fast foods and sin taxes among others to fill the gap in any funding previously received.\n\nZimbabwe has however been battling a shrinking tax and revenue base due to economic difficulties that have resulted in the closure of companies and flight by international investors.\n\nCompanies such as Standard Chartered have recently divested from Zimbabwe while audit and accountancy firms have also been divesting, passing on operations to local management under new brands.\n\n",
