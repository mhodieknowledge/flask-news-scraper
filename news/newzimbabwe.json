Management is hopeful the Authorities will continue to intervene in this matter to promote fair competition in the operating environment, said the company.\n\nDuring the period, Farm & City Centre (FCC) sales volumes increased by 9% compared to the comparative period prior year on the back of the agro sectors rebound following the prior years drought.\n\nNotwithstanding increased competition, the entity continued to enjoy the fruits of mutually beneficial relations with its suppliers for key revenue drivers, which have continued to guarantee the businesss stability. The entity continues to implement enhanced product diversification strategies.\n\nIn the same reporting period, Agrifoods sales volumes increased by 13.9% during the quarter against a comparative prior year period, attributable to improved aggregate demand for its products.\n\nManagement remains focused on growing Agrifoods market share notwithstanding increased competition in the feed sector. The business remains responsive to evolving market dynamics and customer needs, with focused engagement and adaptive strategies deployed across operations.\n\nDuring the quarter, Victoria Foods sales volumes declined by 3% compared to the same period the prior year, influenced by grain shortages caused by the drought from the prior year and the late start of the maize harvest.\n\nGoing forward, the Group anticipates the FY2025 economic outturn to remain challenging, influenced by liquidity constraints and reduced aggregate demand. Ongoing cost containment measures will continue to be implemented, added CFI.\n\n",

Asked if she admitted that death would result, she responded: Yes The child died.\n\nThe trial magistrate sentenced her to 12 months in prison, of which four were suspended for good behaviour. The remaining eight months were wholly suspended on condition she performed 280 hours of community service at Sunge Police Station.\n\nHowever, during routine scrutiny, the Regional Magistrate raised concerns over inconsistencies between the charge sheet and the state outline.\n\nThe charge sheet stated the child had been left unwrapped, while the outline erroneously recorded that the baby had been wrapped.\n\nHe also highlighted that the post-mortem listed the cause of death as indeterminate, questioning whether the child had been born alive.\n\nI am of the view that it is not clear if she gave birth to a live baby and hence should have been charged with concealment, the Regional Magistrate wrote in referring the case for review.\n\nForoma, however, found that the contradiction stemmed from a clerical omission  the word not had been dropped in the state outline.\n\nHad the scrutinising Magistrate read in between the lines, the reason for the contradiction would have become apparent, he ruled.\n\nThe High Court further held that the accuseds mental state and circumstances  central to the charge of infanticide under Section 48(3)  were canvassed adequately during sentencing.\n\nForoma concluded: It is clear that the proceedings under review were conducted in a manner that resulted in real and substantial justice being achieved. I confirm that the proceedings were conducted in a manner that ensured the achievement of real and substantial justice.\n\n",

            "content": "The Voice\n\nAMBITIOUS refugee Tawanda Muyeye is now a star of The Hundred. In early 2021, months before signing his professional contract with Kent Cricket, Tawanda had his right to remain in the United Kingdom approved by the Home Office.\n\nBorn and bred in Zimbabwe, Tawanda moved to England at the age of 17 and attended Eastbourne College on a cricket scholarship, while spending some time with the Sussex Academy.\n\nNow a batter for Kent Cricket and the Oval Invincibles, Tawanda is set to compete at The Hundred, where he will be one of the few Black players at the tournament.\n\nFor me to be a Black player, playing cricket in England, it just shows that there are no boundaries, Tawanda toldThe Voice.\n\nIf you have dreams, you can achieve them. The colour of your skin doesnt matter. Of course, therell be hurdles along the way, but I think being a player of colour and being a representative is quite a big thing because it just shows that anything is possible.\n\nWhile his professional career began in England, Tawandas love for cricket was born in Zimbabwe when he was just a child.\n\nFor me to be a Black player, playing cricket in England, it just shows that there are no boundaries\n\nMy brother was the person who got me into cricket. On the weekends, when hed come back home from boarding school, I would play cricket with him. Thats how it all started.\n\nIn the High School that I attended, theyd just built a high performance cricket centre, which is unheard of in Zimbabwe, unless youre playing for the national team.\n\nThere werent many high performance centres, especially not in schools, so that was a massive thing, and I spent a lot of my time in there.\n\nWhen I moved to England, I think the biggest change was the weather! Goodness, I found that change difficult, even in April, May, it was still quite chilly for a Zimbabwean kid.\n\nTawanda made a big impression during his time at Eastbourne College. His runs led him to be namedWisdensSchools Cricketer of the Year for 2020, and Kent took notice.\n\nKent are a big reason Im where I am today. They had to jump through some hurdles to get me to this point because Im a refugee, and my family are refugees.\n\nThere was a man named Paul Downton, he was the Director of Cricket at Kent, and he went out of his way to help me. Kent gave me the opportunity to grow and develop as a player, and theyve given me the platform to showcase what I can do.\n\nLooking back four years later, Im just very grateful for Kent and everything theyve done for me.\n\nIve just signed a new contract with them, and I want to give them a shoutout because it wasnt easy for them initially, but they made my life easier and treated me like a normal person and welcomed me with open arms.\n\nTawanda has achieved so much already, and it is the 24-year-olds mindset which keeps him moving forward.\n\nFor me, its about striving to be the best that I can be, not comparing myself to others, because I believe comparison is the thief of all joy.\n\nWhen you get into the professional game, it becomes a bit more complex, and the transition isnt easy. However, I think because I have that desire to be the best that I can be, it keeps me going and keeps me motivated to achieve my goals.\n\nMy main aspiration is to play cricket for England, to play as many Test matches as I can for England. However, I dont just want to play for England once, I want to play for a long time and be good enough to achieve that goal.\n\nKent had to jump through some hurdles to get me to this point because Im a refugee, and my family are refugees.\n\nWhile his focus is on cricket, Tawanda hopes he is remembered for so much more than just the sport. When I do finish playing cricket, I hope people remember me as a person first and foremost, because Im a human being. I go through everything that every other human being goes through.\n\nI dont want people to put me on a pedestal, because no one is bigger than anyone or bigger than the sport. If people are to think about me when I finish playing, I just want them to think that I was entertaining, and a fun person to watch.\n\nI just want to be myself, go out there, be free and play with a smile on my face and inspire people to have fun with what theyre doing.\n\n",
