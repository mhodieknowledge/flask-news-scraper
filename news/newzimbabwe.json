            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nDESPITE several cases having been reported on human-wildlife conflict resulting in death and injury countrywide over the years, it is sad to note that Zimbabwe still lacks policy on compensation for those affected.\n\nEnvironment Minister Evelyn Ndlovu last week told the Senate, through a ministerial statement, that until the Parks and Wildlife Amendment Bill went through Parliament, government was incapacitated to to come up with any programme regarding compensation for victims.\n\nEvery month, cases of wild animals attacking people are being reported and some have lost lives whilst others got permanent injuries but there have been no policy or law to effect compensation.\n\nIt is important to note that Zimbabwe currently lacks a formal nationwide policy on compensation, until the Bill goes through Parliament and through the Senate, we are incapacitated to come up with a programme.\n\nThis compensation fund, is relief for the loss of human life due to human-wildlife conflict, will only be developed once the Act is passed through Senate and is gazetted, Ndlovu said.\n\nShe said CAMPFIRE districts instead, were using local mechanisms to assist victims with funeral and medical expenses and some districts extend support to victims children by paying school fees.\n\nThe government, through a November 2022 Cabinet Resolution and the August 2023 SONA announcement by President Emmerson Mnangagwa was committed to establishing the Human-Wildlife Conflict Relief Fund.\n\nThe Parks and Wildlife Bill, which is in the final stages in the House, is intended to provide the legal framework for this fund.\n\nThrough specific funding, although specific funding mechanisms are yet to be determined, once enacted, the Bill will enable relief for victims in cases of death, injury, maiming and hospitalisation resulting from wildlife conflict, said the minister.\n\nHowever, Ndlovu stated relief was not expected to extend to livestock predation and crop damage at this initial phase.\n\nShe highlighted: This legislative change is a significant step in addressing relief for the affected communities, as we seek to incorporate relief for crop damage and livestock predation in the near future.\n\nRecommendation number five, the Minister of Tourism and Hospitality Industry, through ZimParks authorities, should consider to raise the elephant quota per year from the current three to a minimum of 10 elephants per year for the communities co-existing with wildlife.\n\nThe minister submitted that the recommendation was from the Environment Parliamentary Committee and ZimParks took note of the recommendation to increase the elephant management quota for communities co-existing with the wildlife.\n\nNdlovu undertook to act on the recommendation.\n\n",

            "content": "By Victor Oluwole l Business Insider Africa\n\nZIMBABWEAN billionaire Strive Masiyiwa is leading a new push to build AI infrastructure across Africa.Masiyiwa is a prominent African entrepreneur known for pioneering mobile telecommunications and challenging state-owned monopolies.He is currently focusing on developing digital infrastructure in Africa through his company Cassava Technologies.Masiyiwa plans to establish AI factories in five countries, specialized for artificial intelligence workloads.This initiative aims to empower local AI development, enhance data security, and position Africa as a leader in digital innovation.He became one of the first African businessmen to challenge state-owned telecom monopolies and win. That step made many people see him as a symbol of progress and determination in Africa.In recent years, he has stayed out of the public eye, but he has been quietly working on something much bigger. He is building a group of digital infrastructure companies that could play an important role in Africas technology future.This work is happening through his company Cassava Technologies. Cassava brings together several of his businesses that are focused on building and running the systems that make the internet work.These include fibre optic cables, data centres, and cloud computing services. Together, they are forming one of the strongest digital backbones in Africa.Through Liquid Intelligent Technologies, Cassava operates more than 100,000 kilometres of fibre optic cables that run through over a dozen African countries.These cables carry internet traffic between cities and countries every day. They connect millions of people, businesses, and public services. Having such a large network gives Cassava a strong base to support other digital services.Another part of Cassava is Africa Data Centres, which runs some of the biggest data storage and processing facilities on the continent.These data centres store and manage information for banks, companies, hospitals, schools, and government agencies. They are open to different internet providers and cloud service companies, which makes them useful to many organisations.Data centers are facilities that can provide the computing power often needed for AI operations.Cassava also runs cloud computing services through companies like Liquid C2 and Cloudmania. These provide secure digital tools and platforms that allow African businesses and public institutions to run their services locally without depending only on foreign providers.This infrastructure has taken many years to build. It gives Masiyiwa something that is rare in Africa. He controls not just one part of the digital system, but several layers of it.This puts him in a strong position as Africa begins to enter the era of artificial intelligence. He is now using this base to build what he calls AI factories across the continent.Recently, Masiyiwa announced plans to build five AI factories in South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, and Morocco.These will be special data centres designed to handle the massive computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The total investment is about 720 million US dollars.The first AI factory is already being built in South Africa. It will include around 3,000 powerful Nvidia graphics processors, which are the type of hardware used to train and run AI systems. Many African universities, researchers, and startups have already booked space to use this computing power.Cassava calls this plan the Sovereign AI Cloud. The goal is to give African countries and organisations the ability to develop and run their own AI systems inside Africa.Speaking in a conversation with James Manyika on the YouTube series AI & Africa | Dialogues on Technology and Society, Masiyiwa explained how he started paying close attention to AI around 2016.I was beginning to realize at that point that this is here now, he said.This is not something in the future.He compares its scale to one of the biggest shifts in human history.Ive been saying for a while that AI is not just like the internet; it is as big as the Industrial Revolution in its impact. The difference is the speed. The Industrial Revolution took a long time. This is going to happen in five or ten years, all that change compressed.Right now, most AI projects in Africa depend on cloud servers in Europe or North America. That is expensive and often slow. It can also raise concerns about data privacy and security.By building local AI infrastructure, Masiyiwa hopes to make it cheaper, faster, and safer for Africans to build and use new technologies.Reports say only about five percent of Africas AI talent currently has access to the powerful computing tools they need. Masiyiwa wants to change that and open access to many more people across the continent.His companies are also receiving support from international partnersThe International Finance Corporation has invested in Liquid Intelligent Technologies to help expand its data centres and fibre networks in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt. Cassava is also upgrading its existing data centres with Nvidia supercomputers so they can handle AI workloads.Large global technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon Web Services, Anthropic, and Nvidia have also worked with Cassava as partners or suppliers.In 2025, TIME magazine named Strive Masiyiwa to its TIME100 AI list and described his efforts as a major step forward for Africas digital future.If this plan works, it could help many areas of life in AfricaMasiyiwa believes Africa must not miss this opportunity. We dont want to be users any more than we want to be used, he said.We want to fully participate in the economic opportunity. Our entrepreneurs must feel they are part of this; that we are creating wealth, not just using platforms where others get the benefit.We are seeing no investment at all with respect to AI coming into Africa. No one is interested really from outside. More money comes into Africa from diaspora remittances than from foreign direct investment. Its not that our people dont have ideas. Theres no capital coming in to support those ideas, he said.AI-powered systems can help monitor crops, predict weather, and guide planting decisions.This is why Cassava has focused on building the infrastructure that can support the next generation.In healthcare, AI could help doctors find illnesses and keep patient records. In agriculture, it could help track weather, plan planting times, and grow more food.In education, it could help students learn in local languages. In banking, it could help find fraud, check credit records, and serve customers better.These tools work best when the computing power is close to where the data is collected. Building them in Africa could make them faster, cheaper, and more secure.There are still challengesAI factories and data centres use a lot of electricity, and many African countries do not have steady power supply.Bringing in advanced hardware like Nvidia chips can also be slow and expensive because of shipping delays and customs processes.There are not enough trained engineers, data scientists, and AI experts to run these systems, so more training will be needed. Each country also has its own rules about data protection, privacy, and taxes, and this can slow down projects.At the same time, global technology companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google are also building data centres in Africa. Cassava will have to compete with them while proving that its systems are reliable and affordable.But what makes Masiyiwas effort different is that it is homegrown and Pan-African.While many foreign companies are only just beginning to build in Africa, he has spent years quietly putting the foundation in place.He has built the fibre cables, the data centres, and the cloud systems that Africa will need for the future. Now he is connecting all these pieces and adding powerful AI infrastructure on top of them.If it works, the man who helped connect Africa to mobile phones may also be remembered as the man who helped connect Africa to the age of artificial intelligence.\n\nZIMBABWEAN billionaire Strive Masiyiwa is leading a new push to build AI infrastructure across Africa.\n\nMasiyiwa is a prominent African entrepreneur known for pioneering mobile telecommunications and challenging state-owned monopolies.He is currently focusing on developing digital infrastructure in Africa through his company Cassava Technologies.Masiyiwa plans to establish AI factories in five countries, specialized for artificial intelligence workloads.This initiative aims to empower local AI development, enhance data security, and position Africa as a leader in digital innovation.He became one of the first African businessmen to challenge state-owned telecom monopolies and win.

It can also raise concerns about data privacy and security.By building local AI infrastructure, Masiyiwa hopes to make it cheaper, faster, and safer for Africans to build and use new technologies.Reports say only about five percent of Africas AI talent currently has access to the powerful computing tools they need. Masiyiwa wants to change that and open access to many more people across the continent.His companies are also receiving support from international partnersThe International Finance Corporation has invested in Liquid Intelligent Technologies to help expand its data centres and fibre networks in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt. Cassava is also upgrading its existing data centres with Nvidia supercomputers so they can handle AI workloads.Large global technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon Web Services, Anthropic, and Nvidia have also worked with Cassava as partners or suppliers.In 2025, TIME magazine named Strive Masiyiwa to its TIME100 AI list and described his efforts as a major step forward for Africas digital future.If this plan works, it could help many areas of life in AfricaMasiyiwa believes Africa must not miss this opportunity. We dont want to be users any more than we want to be used, he said.We want to fully participate in the economic opportunity. Our entrepreneurs must feel they are part of this; that we are creating wealth, not just using platforms where others get the benefit.We are seeing no investment at all with respect to AI coming into Africa. No one is interested really from outside. More money comes into Africa from diaspora remittances than from foreign direct investment. Its not that our people dont have ideas. Theres no capital coming in to support those ideas, he said.AI-powered systems can help monitor crops, predict weather, and guide planting decisions.This is why Cassava has focused on building the infrastructure that can support the next generation.In healthcare, AI could help doctors find illnesses and keep patient records. In agriculture, it could help track weather, plan planting times, and grow more food.In education, it could help students learn in local languages. In banking, it could help find fraud, check credit records, and serve customers better.These tools work best when the computing power is close to where the data is collected. Building them in Africa could make them faster, cheaper, and more secure.There are still challengesAI factories and data centres use a lot of electricity, and many African countries do not have steady power supply.Bringing in advanced hardware like Nvidia chips can also be slow and expensive because of shipping delays and customs processes.There are not enough trained engineers, data scientists, and AI experts to run these systems, so more training will be needed. Each country also has its own rules about data protection, privacy, and taxes, and this can slow down projects.At the same time, global technology companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google are also building data centres in Africa. Cassava will have to compete with them while proving that its systems are reliable and affordable.But what makes Masiyiwas effort different is that it is homegrown and Pan-African.While many foreign companies are only just beginning to build in Africa, he has spent years quietly putting the foundation in place.He has built the fibre cables, the data centres, and the cloud systems that Africa will need for the future. Now he is connecting all these pieces and adding powerful AI infrastructure on top of them.If it works, the man who helped connect Africa to mobile phones may also be remembered as the man who helped connect Africa to the age of artificial intelligence.\n\nThis initiative aims to empower local AI development, enhance data security, and position Africa as a leader in digital innovation.\n\nHe became one of the first African businessmen to challenge state-owned telecom monopolies and win. That step made many people see him as a symbol of progress and determination in Africa.In recent years, he has stayed out of the public eye, but he has been quietly working on something much bigger. He is building a group of digital infrastructure companies that could play an important role in Africas technology future.This work is happening through his company Cassava Technologies. Cassava brings together several of his businesses that are focused on building and running the systems that make the internet work.These include fibre optic cables, data centres, and cloud computing services. Together, they are forming one of the strongest digital backbones in Africa.Through Liquid Intelligent Technologies, Cassava operates more than 100,000 kilometres of fibre optic cables that run through over a dozen African countries.These cables carry internet traffic between cities and countries every day. They connect millions of people, businesses, and public services. Having such a large network gives Cassava a strong base to support other digital services.Another part of Cassava is Africa Data Centres, which runs some of the biggest data storage and processing facilities on the continent.These data centres store and manage information for banks, companies, hospitals, schools, and government agencies. They are open to different internet providers and cloud service companies, which makes them useful to many organisations.Data centers are facilities that can provide the computing power often needed for AI operations.Cassava also runs cloud computing services through companies like Liquid C2 and Cloudmania. These provide secure digital tools and platforms that allow African businesses and public institutions to run their services locally without depending only on foreign providers.This infrastructure has taken many years to build. It gives Masiyiwa something that is rare in Africa. He controls not just one part of the digital system, but several layers of it.This puts him in a strong position as Africa begins to enter the era of artificial intelligence. He is now using this base to build what he calls AI factories across the continent.Recently, Masiyiwa announced plans to build five AI factories in South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, and Morocco.These will be special data centres designed to handle the massive computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The total investment is about 720 million US dollars.The first AI factory is already being built in South Africa. It will include around 3,000 powerful Nvidia graphics processors, which are the type of hardware used to train and run AI systems. Many African universities, researchers, and startups have already booked space to use this computing power.Cassava calls this plan the Sovereign AI Cloud. The goal is to give African countries and organisations the ability to develop and run their own AI systems inside Africa.Speaking in a conversation with James Manyika on the YouTube series AI & Africa | Dialogues on Technology and Society, Masiyiwa explained how he started paying close attention to AI around 2016.I was beginning to realize at that point that this is here now, he said.This is not something in the future.He compares its scale to one of the biggest shifts in human history.Ive been saying for a while that AI is not just like the internet; it is as big as the Industrial Revolution in its impact.

Now he is connecting all these pieces and adding powerful AI infrastructure on top of them.If it works, the man who helped connect Africa to mobile phones may also be remembered as the man who helped connect Africa to the age of artificial intelligence.\n\nThrough Liquid Intelligent Technologies, Cassava operates more than 100,000 kilometres of fibre optic cables that run through over a dozen African countries.\n\nThese cables carry internet traffic between cities and countries every day. They connect millions of people, businesses, and public services. Having such a large network gives Cassava a strong base to support other digital services.Another part of Cassava is Africa Data Centres, which runs some of the biggest data storage and processing facilities on the continent.These data centres store and manage information for banks, companies, hospitals, schools, and government agencies. They are open to different internet providers and cloud service companies, which makes them useful to many organisations.Data centers are facilities that can provide the computing power often needed for AI operations.Cassava also runs cloud computing services through companies like Liquid C2 and Cloudmania. These provide secure digital tools and platforms that allow African businesses and public institutions to run their services locally without depending only on foreign providers.This infrastructure has taken many years to build. It gives Masiyiwa something that is rare in Africa. He controls not just one part of the digital system, but several layers of it.This puts him in a strong position as Africa begins to enter the era of artificial intelligence. He is now using this base to build what he calls AI factories across the continent.Recently, Masiyiwa announced plans to build five AI factories in South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, and Morocco.These will be special data centres designed to handle the massive computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The total investment is about 720 million US dollars.The first AI factory is already being built in South Africa. It will include around 3,000 powerful Nvidia graphics processors, which are the type of hardware used to train and run AI systems. Many African universities, researchers, and startups have already booked space to use this computing power.Cassava calls this plan the Sovereign AI Cloud. The goal is to give African countries and organisations the ability to develop and run their own AI systems inside Africa.Speaking in a conversation with James Manyika on the YouTube series AI & Africa | Dialogues on Technology and Society, Masiyiwa explained how he started paying close attention to AI around 2016.I was beginning to realize at that point that this is here now, he said.This is not something in the future.He compares its scale to one of the biggest shifts in human history.Ive been saying for a while that AI is not just like the internet; it is as big as the Industrial Revolution in its impact. The difference is the speed. The Industrial Revolution took a long time. This is going to happen in five or ten years, all that change compressed.Right now, most AI projects in Africa depend on cloud servers in Europe or North America. That is expensive and often slow. It can also raise concerns about data privacy and security.By building local AI infrastructure, Masiyiwa hopes to make it cheaper, faster, and safer for Africans to build and use new technologies.Reports say only about five percent of Africas AI talent currently has access to the powerful computing tools they need. Masiyiwa wants to change that and open access to many more people across the continent.His companies are also receiving support from international partnersThe International Finance Corporation has invested in Liquid Intelligent Technologies to help expand its data centres and fibre networks in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt. Cassava is also upgrading its existing data centres with Nvidia supercomputers so they can handle AI workloads.Large global technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon Web Services, Anthropic, and Nvidia have also worked with Cassava as partners or suppliers.In 2025, TIME magazine named Strive Masiyiwa to its TIME100 AI list and described his efforts as a major step forward for Africas digital future.If this plan works, it could help many areas of life in AfricaMasiyiwa believes Africa must not miss this opportunity. We dont want to be users any more than we want to be used, he said.We want to fully participate in the economic opportunity. Our entrepreneurs must feel they are part of this; that we are creating wealth, not just using platforms where others get the benefit.We are seeing no investment at all with respect to AI coming into Africa. No one is interested really from outside. More money comes into Africa from diaspora remittances than from foreign direct investment. Its not that our people dont have ideas. Theres no capital coming in to support those ideas, he said.AI-powered systems can help monitor crops, predict weather, and guide planting decisions.This is why Cassava has focused on building the infrastructure that can support the next generation.In healthcare, AI could help doctors find illnesses and keep patient records. In agriculture, it could help track weather, plan planting times, and grow more food.In education, it could help students learn in local languages. In banking, it could help find fraud, check credit records, and serve customers better.These tools work best when the computing power is close to where the data is collected. Building them in Africa could make them faster, cheaper, and more secure.There are still challengesAI factories and data centres use a lot of electricity, and many African countries do not have steady power supply.Bringing in advanced hardware like Nvidia chips can also be slow and expensive because of shipping delays and customs processes.There are not enough trained engineers, data scientists, and AI experts to run these systems, so more training will be needed.

The goal is to give African countries and organisations the ability to develop and run their own AI systems inside Africa.Speaking in a conversation with James Manyika on the YouTube series AI & Africa | Dialogues on Technology and Society, Masiyiwa explained how he started paying close attention to AI around 2016.I was beginning to realize at that point that this is here now, he said.This is not something in the future.He compares its scale to one of the biggest shifts in human history.Ive been saying for a while that AI is not just like the internet; it is as big as the Industrial Revolution in its impact. The difference is the speed. The Industrial Revolution took a long time. This is going to happen in five or ten years, all that change compressed.Right now, most AI projects in Africa depend on cloud servers in Europe or North America. That is expensive and often slow. It can also raise concerns about data privacy and security.By building local AI infrastructure, Masiyiwa hopes to make it cheaper, faster, and safer for Africans to build and use new technologies.Reports say only about five percent of Africas AI talent currently has access to the powerful computing tools they need. Masiyiwa wants to change that and open access to many more people across the continent.His companies are also receiving support from international partnersThe International Finance Corporation has invested in Liquid Intelligent Technologies to help expand its data centres and fibre networks in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt. Cassava is also upgrading its existing data centres with Nvidia supercomputers so they can handle AI workloads.Large global technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon Web Services, Anthropic, and Nvidia have also worked with Cassava as partners or suppliers.In 2025, TIME magazine named Strive Masiyiwa to its TIME100 AI list and described his efforts as a major step forward for Africas digital future.If this plan works, it could help many areas of life in AfricaMasiyiwa believes Africa must not miss this opportunity. We dont want to be users any more than we want to be used, he said.We want to fully participate in the economic opportunity. Our entrepreneurs must feel they are part of this; that we are creating wealth, not just using platforms where others get the benefit.We are seeing no investment at all with respect to AI coming into Africa. No one is interested really from outside. More money comes into Africa from diaspora remittances than from foreign direct investment. Its not that our people dont have ideas. Theres no capital coming in to support those ideas, he said.AI-powered systems can help monitor crops, predict weather, and guide planting decisions.This is why Cassava has focused on building the infrastructure that can support the next generation.In healthcare, AI could help doctors find illnesses and keep patient records. In agriculture, it could help track weather, plan planting times, and grow more food.In education, it could help students learn in local languages. In banking, it could help find fraud, check credit records, and serve customers better.These tools work best when the computing power is close to where the data is collected. Building them in Africa could make them faster, cheaper, and more secure.There are still challengesAI factories and data centres use a lot of electricity, and many African countries do not have steady power supply.Bringing in advanced hardware like Nvidia chips can also be slow and expensive because of shipping delays and customs processes.There are not enough trained engineers, data scientists, and AI experts to run these systems, so more training will be needed. Each country also has its own rules about data protection, privacy, and taxes, and this can slow down projects.At the same time, global technology companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google are also building data centres in Africa. Cassava will have to compete with them while proving that its systems are reliable and affordable.But what makes Masiyiwas effort different is that it is homegrown and Pan-African.While many foreign companies are only just beginning to build in Africa, he has spent years quietly putting the foundation in place.He has built the fibre cables, the data centres, and the cloud systems that Africa will need for the future. Now he is connecting all these pieces and adding powerful AI infrastructure on top of them.If it works, the man who helped connect Africa to mobile phones may also be remembered as the man who helped connect Africa to the age of artificial intelligence.\n\nThis puts him in a strong position as Africa begins to enter the era of artificial intelligence. He is now using this base to build what he calls AI factories across the continent.\n\nRecently, Masiyiwa announced plans to build five AI factories in South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, and Morocco.These will be special data centres designed to handle the massive computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The total investment is about 720 million US dollars.The first AI factory is already being built in South Africa. It will include around 3,000 powerful Nvidia graphics processors, which are the type of hardware used to train and run AI systems.

This is going to happen in five or ten years, all that change compressed.Right now, most AI projects in Africa depend on cloud servers in Europe or North America. That is expensive and often slow. It can also raise concerns about data privacy and security.By building local AI infrastructure, Masiyiwa hopes to make it cheaper, faster, and safer for Africans to build and use new technologies.Reports say only about five percent of Africas AI talent currently has access to the powerful computing tools they need. Masiyiwa wants to change that and open access to many more people across the continent.His companies are also receiving support from international partnersThe International Finance Corporation has invested in Liquid Intelligent Technologies to help expand its data centres and fibre networks in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt. Cassava is also upgrading its existing data centres with Nvidia supercomputers so they can handle AI workloads.Large global technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon Web Services, Anthropic, and Nvidia have also worked with Cassava as partners or suppliers.In 2025, TIME magazine named Strive Masiyiwa to its TIME100 AI list and described his efforts as a major step forward for Africas digital future.If this plan works, it could help many areas of life in AfricaMasiyiwa believes Africa must not miss this opportunity. We dont want to be users any more than we want to be used, he said.We want to fully participate in the economic opportunity. Our entrepreneurs must feel they are part of this; that we are creating wealth, not just using platforms where others get the benefit.We are seeing no investment at all with respect to AI coming into Africa. No one is interested really from outside. More money comes into Africa from diaspora remittances than from foreign direct investment. Its not that our people dont have ideas. Theres no capital coming in to support those ideas, he said.AI-powered systems can help monitor crops, predict weather, and guide planting decisions.This is why Cassava has focused on building the infrastructure that can support the next generation.In healthcare, AI could help doctors find illnesses and keep patient records. In agriculture, it could help track weather, plan planting times, and grow more food.In education, it could help students learn in local languages. In banking, it could help find fraud, check credit records, and serve customers better.These tools work best when the computing power is close to where the data is collected. Building them in Africa could make them faster, cheaper, and more secure.There are still challengesAI factories and data centres use a lot of electricity, and many African countries do not have steady power supply.Bringing in advanced hardware like Nvidia chips can also be slow and expensive because of shipping delays and customs processes.There are not enough trained engineers, data scientists, and AI experts to run these systems, so more training will be needed. Each country also has its own rules about data protection, privacy, and taxes, and this can slow down projects.At the same time, global technology companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google are also building data centres in Africa. Cassava will have to compete with them while proving that its systems are reliable and affordable.But what makes Masiyiwas effort different is that it is homegrown and Pan-African.While many foreign companies are only just beginning to build in Africa, he has spent years quietly putting the foundation in place.He has built the fibre cables, the data centres, and the cloud systems that Africa will need for the future.

In agriculture, it could help track weather, plan planting times, and grow more food.In education, it could help students learn in local languages. In banking, it could help find fraud, check credit records, and serve customers better.These tools work best when the computing power is close to where the data is collected.
