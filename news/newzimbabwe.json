Running to achieve personal goals with every mile completed.\n\nWhen all one needs is a good pair of shoes, running seems like an easy activity to start. However, running requires preparation and training, both physically and mentally.\n\nAn avid runner herself, Camille Worthington, Ph.D., assistant professor and registered dietitian in theUniversity of Alabama at BirminghamDivision of General Internal Medicine and Population Science,discusses an important aspect to ones running success  how to fuel the body.\n\nWhen fueling your body, it is easy to fall behind and hard to catch up, Worthington said. However, proper fueling before, during and after a run is essential to hitting your goals while keeping your body safe and healthy.\n\nProper fueling before, during and after running is essential to hitting goals and keeping your body safe and healthy.\n\nKnow your fuels\n\nComplex carbohydrates have slow digestion and absorption rates. They are a good source for sustained energy, which is needed for longer runs. Complex carbs include whole wheat breads, whole grain crackers and vegetables.\n\nSimple carbs are quickly digested and absorbed. They are sources of quick but short-term energy, which is beneficial during runs when one needs an energy boost. Simple carbs include pasta, white bread, chips, cookies and candy.\n\nProtein offers many benefits for the body. For runners, it plays a crucial role in muscle recovery and helps reduce hunger. Proteins include lean meats, dairy products, eggs, yogurt and nuts.\n\nElectrolytes, such as sodium,help maintain fluid and hydration levels in the body. Electrolytes are lost through sweat during exercise. Low levels can lead to muscle cramps, dehydration and dizziness. Electrolytes are naturally found in such foods as leafy greens, avocados, pickles, nuts and bananas.\n\nProducts such as gels, gummies, water, electrolyte packets, bars and salt tabs are popular fuel sources for runners. They often contain higher concentrations of carbs and electrolytes, such as sodium.\n\nTime it out\n\nProperly timing the intake of the fuels is as important as knowing what fuels to consume, Worthington says.\n\nFuel recommendations prior to a run depend on when one wants to eat. If you eat several hours before, focus on a mix of complex and simple carbs to increase different types of energy within the body. If you prefer eating closer to the run, prioritize simple carbs the body can quickly digest.\n\nStay hydrated with water before the run. For runs longer than an hour or in hot weather, preload with electrolytes.\n\nDuring a run, focus on simple carbs for bursts of energy. Complex carbs during a run can lead to sluggishness and gastrointestinal issues due to their slow digestion rate. Maintaining hydration levels with water, electrolytes and sodium is also a priority.\n\nStay hydrated with water before the run.\n\nFor runs longer than an hour or in hot weather, preload with electrolytes.After a run, mix complex carbs with protein. The carbs restore glucose stores in your liver and muscles that were used during your run. Protein helps with muscle recovery and can satiate hunger. Replenish hydration levels with electrolytes and water.\n\nWorthington suggests post-run snacks such as:\n\nUltimately, the perfect fuel routine comes down to the runners preference. When experimenting, Worthington suggests changing only one fuel source at a time to understand what specific foods and products work best with ones body.\n\nIt is a lot of trial and error. Worry less about the specific product, and more about the fuel source and ingredients, Worthington said. Find what you like, what makes sense for your body and training, and what works best for your budget.\n\n",

            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nA CHINESE national, presented as an investor within the gold mining sector, has been convicted for stealing over US$875,000 worth of the precious metal from a local small-scale miner and illegally operating in Mashonaland Easts Makaha area.\n\nDocuments from the Mines Ministry, sourced by NewZimbabwe.com, and a Mutoko Regional Magistrates Court ruling have all exposed a well-coordinated syndicate comprising Zheng Zhangxian, the Chinese investor and a mines official, amongst others.\n\nZheng, who was convicted and had his questionably registered company, Reajin Enterprises, receive a restitution order of US$875,667.67, is reported to have been encroaching on a claim belonging to Emmanuel Ndemeras Koodoo 83 claim for the past four years.\n\nReajin Enterprises had been operating as Takura Mining Syndicate, which held a Special Grant, in some form of partnership with a Zimbabwean partner, Vengai Kurarama.\n\nTakura Mining Syndicates claim was next to Ndemeras, from which they knowingly stole his gold ore.\n\nZheng, up until this year, had been mining 75 metres below the surface of Ndemeras claim where he is said to have stolen over 5,000 tonnes of gold ore.\n\nDocuments in NewZimbabwe.coms possession reveal successful investigations into Zhengs operations and payment of a US$350 bribe to Mines Ministry Inspector Anthony Singende, who has since been dismissed.\n\nSingende, who was part of the ministrys investigating team that provided evidence of blasting and Zhengs ore theft on Ndemeras claim, was not only paid to curtail investigations but went as far as sanctioning continued blasting on the property against ministry guidelines. His criminal case is being pursued at the Marondera Magistrates Court.\n\nThe traverse survey clearly indicates encroachment of a haulage in Adit No. 5 along strike with stoping (active extraction of ore) done above the distance of approximately 75 metres.\n\nWe recommend that Takura Mining Syndicate cease mining operations within the boundary of Ndemera and construct a containment wall 6m inside their own boundary, read a report that followed investigations.\n\nThe 6m is mandated by Statutory Instrument (SI) 109 of 1990 (Mine Management and Safety Regulations).\n\nThe ore was processed at the Chinese-owned Zhangveng Milling Plant according to a letter sent to Ndemera by Provincial Mining Director Tendai Kashiri. The milling plant, together with Zhengs own partnership, was last month exposed to have been operating illegally in the country.\n\nWhereas foreign investors are supposed to be cleared by the Zimbabwe Investments Development Agency (ZIDA), legally bound to form and register companies, the two formed mining syndicates with locals against policies meant to govern foreign investments.\n\nReajin Enterprises was convicted on September 8, this year, of contravening Section 113(1)(a) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act as read with Section 379 of the Mines and Minerals Act (theft of gold ore).\n\nA fine of US$3,000 was imposed, restitution of US$875,667.67 ordered and the entire ore dump was to be returned to Ndemera.\n\n",

            "content": "Post Independent\n\nLike many asylum seekers, immigrants and refugees, Shayna Oosthuysens childhood was split between two worlds  the wild beauty of Southern Africa and the disorienting unknown of a new life in America.\n\nThe Rifle-based artist was raised on a multi-generational family farm in Zimbabwe. With no fences separating her home from the wild African bush, Oosthuysen spent her childhood immersed in nature and building fairy gardens from rocks, flowers and shells in her familys sprawling yard.\n\nWe lived on a farm where there are no fences or anything, and theres just African bush, Oosthuysen said. My mom had these gardens of flowers and rocks and vines and huge trees and a lot of my childhood was spent down, deep in the garden.\n\n(My mom) was always creating or painting and embracing her own creative world, Oosthuysen said, explaining how her mother would use unique canvases like ostrich eggs. Im a lot like her and so she just inspires me\n\nBut in 2006, a changing political climate in Zimbabwe forced Oosthuysens family to seek asylum in the United States. At just 11 years old, she was uprooted from the only world she had ever known.\n\nWe lost everything pretty traumatically, Oosthuysen said. Six months later, we came to the U.S. with a suitcase and started entirely from scratch.\n\nCaught between her identity in Africa and her new life in America, Oosthuysen struggled to adjust. Assimilation was difficult. She was bullied for her accent and eventually worked to shed it.\n\nIm really thankful to be here and we have a lot of opportunities that we otherwise would never have had, Oosthuysen said. But immigration, no matter where you go or immigrate from or to, its just really, really hard.\n\nThroughout the transition, art became her compass. As a teenager, Oosthuysen used her canvases like visual diaries full of vibrant colors and abstract swirls, each piece captured feelings she couldnt always put into words. Today, free-form paintings remain a way for Oosthuysen, who was recently diagnosed with autism, to express emotions she cant verbalize.\n\nThough her creative pursuits have come in waves throughout adulthood, Oosthuysen made a life-changing decision in June: she quit her job to pursue art full time.\n\nGetting my art out there has been something Ive been wanting to do for 10 years, Oosthuysen said. There are always better artists, but then, I was just like, why not?\n\nShe launched her art under the name Flame Lily Works, inspired by Zimbabwes national flower. The flame lily is more than a symbol of home to Oosthuysen  its a metaphor for resilience.\n\nIt actually looks like a flame and its very beautiful, but its also known to be able to grow in some really harsh environments and be able to bloom through drought and things like that,Oosthuysen said. I love flowers, they are one of my most favorite things, but also its one thing that connects me to where Im from, and then I feel like its very symbolic of me as a person.\n\nIn recent months, Oosthuysen has sold her work at markets in Rifle and Carbondale and launched an Etsy shop under the nameFlameLilyFairy.\n\nFor Oosthuysen, art is more than just a passion its a way of connecting back to the child she once was and the home in Zimbabwe she abruptly lost.\n\nMy art now mostly is for little Shayna  that little gal who grew up in the bush and had all these different kinds of wild African animals around her and her family, Oosthuysen said. Its my way of connecting back to her and for her.\n\nHer artwork full of color, whimsy and the childlike sense of wonder that accompanied Oosthuysen during her adventures in the Zimbabwe bush  is for anyone who needs a little extra sparkle in their life.\n\nOosthuysens work is also a celebration of neurodivergence. She hopes to build a sense of belonging and community with other neurodivergent people through her abstract, emotive paintings in a collection titled All Brains Are Beautiful\n\nIts nerve wracking, being a neurodivergent person, Oosthuysen said. It takes a lot of energy for me to get (to markets), but once Im there, its really cool to be able to see people find joy or be inspired by my art.\n\nThats really rewarding  to share it with the world knowing that the right people will find it who need it, she added. Thats the part that I really enjoy.\n\n",

The source of his funds is once again under intense scrutiny.\n\nDespite persistent questions about the origin of his wealth, the self-proclaimed supporter of the ruling Zanu PF party recently lavished new cars on all ten Provincial Chairpersons, prompting renewed calls for transparency.\n\nChivayo stated that the expensive gifts were to celebrate President Emmerson Mnangagwas birthday.\n\nEach Provincial Chairperson received a brand new 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 300 series VXR, valued at approximately US$190,000.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday, Chivayo apologised to the Zanu PF Provincial leadership for the delayed token of appreciation.\n\nMy apologies for not having done something sooner, especially following Zanu PFs resounding victory in the 2023 harmonised elections, he wrote.\n\nAs a small token of appreciation, I extend a big CONGRATULATIONS to ALL TEN Provincial Chairpersons, FARAI from Faramatsi Motors located at Club Chambers showroom, Cnr 3rd Street and Nelson Mandela, has supplied your BRAND NEW 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 300 series VXR, valued at $190,000 each, FULLY PAID for and now ready for collection.\n\nHONOURING AND CELEBRATING OUR UNSUNG HEROES ON MUNHUMUTAPA DAYE.D@83\n\nOne of the most exceptional attributes of ZANU PF as a REVOLUTIONARY party is its UNSHAKEABLE foundation that is built on UNITY, development and empowerment. The party has a clear and systematic STRUCTUREpic.twitter.com/qUYX8CntZu\n\n sir_wicknell. (@wicknellchivayo)September 15, 2025\n\nThe businessman also gifted each provincial chairperson US$100,000 in cash, earmarked for development projects in their respective areas.\n\nIn addition to this personal vehicle, each Chairperson will receive a small token of $100,000 in cash for them to support small development and empowerment initiatives in their respective Provinces.\n\nVice President Constantino Chiwenga has indirectly criticised individuals who accumulate wealth through dishonest means, describing them as fundamentally corrupt. He used the vernacular term zvigananda to characterise them.\n\nMnangagwa, on the other hand, has previously described Chivayo as a philanthropist, stating that he could not dictate how Chivayo spends his money.\n\nThis apparent difference in opinion highlights a potential rift between Mnangagwa and his deputy regarding Chivayos business dealings and public displays of wealth.\n\nChivayo, whose philanthropic claims have been met with scepticism, also donated ten Land Cruisers, valued at US$90,000 each, to government hospitals across the country.\n\nThen lastly I am also very pleased to donate 10 brand-new top of the range , state of the art TOYOTA LANDCRUISER (ICU) AMBULANCE valued at USD 90 000 which i kindly and respectfully request should be handed over to the government GENERAL HOSPITAL in each Provincial Capital in honour of President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwas 82nd birthday.\n\nWhile some Zimbabweans have praised Chivayos ambulance donation as a charitable act, others continue to view him with suspicion, portraying him as a thief and a fraudster.\n\n",
