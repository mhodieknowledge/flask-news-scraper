            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nPOLICE in Mashonaland West have arrested a 32-year-old Chinhoyi man for allegedly killing a boy before removing some body parts suspectedly for rituals.\n\nThe mutilated body was found with the stomach ripped open and the genitals were missing.\n\nThe discovery was made on Monday, leading to the arrest of Lloyd Gwenhere of Chogi farm, Inyathi, Chinhoyi.\n\nZimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) Mashonaland West provincial spokesperson, Inspector Ian Kohwera confirmed the gory incident.\n\nCID Chinhoyi arrested Lloyd Gwenhere aged 32, in connection with a case of murder which occurred at Chogi Farm, Inyathi in Chinhoyi, said Kohwera.\n\nThe victim, Munyaradzi Shumba (9), was found dead with a ripped stomach. The neck and left hand were cut, while the victims private parts were missing.\n\nAccording to police, the suspect was allegedly spotted assaulting the victim for letting cattle stray onto his field.\n\nCircumstances are that on June 8, 2025, the deceased was harvesting grains with his grandfather, Isaac Shumba (70) when he was ordered to take over herding cattle from his sister, aged 10, at around 1500 hours.\n\nAt around 1600hrs, elder Shumba sent his daughter, Vongai Shumba (29), to look for Munyaradzi so that he could bring cattle to pull a cart laden with harvested grains.\n\nVongai failed to locate Munyaradzi, prompting her and her father to collect the grain up to around 1700 hours, but Munyaradzi was still nowhere to be found, leading to a search.\n\nA neighbour, Tariro Kwangwari, later told the family that she had witnessed the accused person assaulting the boy before sunset for letting cattle graze on his field.\n\nSearches were conducted by family members and other villagers around the area where the suspect had been seen assaulting the deceased, but they found only his rafters and a pool of blood, said Kohwera.\n\nA further search the next morning unearthed the grisly find of the mutilated body tucked in the grass about 15 metres from the point where the juvenile was allegedly assaulted.\n\nGwenhere was immediately arrested and is helping police with investigations.\n\nInvestigations are underway to establish the cause of the death in a case suspected to be ritual murder. The general public is urged to respect the sanctity of life, said the police spokesman.\n\n",

They have no case to answer.\n\nIt is only unfortunate that such withdrawal happens after all this long and after the long pre-trial incarceration for so long, said Advocate Tapson Dzvetero, representing Mpofu.\n\nThe partners still have one more pending criminal case currently being heard before High Court judge Justice Pisirayi Kwenda.\n\nIn this case, they are accused of defrauding the state of US$7 million in a presidential goats pass on project.\n\n",

Its a way of arm-twisting certain members of our community to resume teaching.\n\nMany here who have not been paid have resolved that, whether they receive the US$230 or not, they will not return. The majority of us have not been paid  yes. But we remain committed. Until junior lecturers get US$2,250, we will not go back to class, said Vengeyi.\n\nThe universitys latest move follows its hiring of adjunct lecturers last month to fill gaps left by the striking staff.\n\nHowever, the AUT has dismissed this as futile, claiming most replacements lack the qualifications to teach at a university level.\n\nThere is no teaching happening at the university. No supervision is taking place. A few scabs have been hired to replace sort of  the lecturers on strike, said Vengeyi further.\n\nThe prolonged strike has disrupted examinations, with planned sittings facing further delays, potentially derailing the academic year.\n\nLast month, six students were arrested after staging flash protests demanding the lecturers return, signalling the growing unrest on campus.\n\n",
