            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo l IOL\n\nActionSA has slammed Home Affairs Minister Dr Leon Schreibers decision to extend the validity of the Zimbabwean Exemption Permits (ZEPs) until 28 May 2027, describing it as another sign of indecision and weakness from the government.\n\nIn a statement, ActionSA parliamentary chief whip Lerato Ngobeni MP said the extension showed the governments unwillingness to confront South Africas immigration crisis head-on.South Africa does not need endless extensions. We need decisive leadership, firm timelines, and an unwavering commitment to the rule of law, Ngobeni said.She said while ActionSA supports a humane and orderly approach to immigration, the ongoing pattern of temporary measures has eroded public confidence, undermined border integrity, and perpetuated inequality between citizens and foreign nationals.Ngobeni said the ministers justification that consultations with the Immigration Advisory Board were still ongoing offers no comfort to South Africans who have waited years for decisive action.There is still no clear, time-bound plan to resolve this long-standing issue, leaving our borders porous and our immigration system in disarray, she said.ActionSA has called on Schreiber to publish a comprehensive transition plan with firm deadlines for the conclusion of consultations and implementation of immigration reforms. The party also urged the strengthening of the Border Management Authority and improved internal enforcement to curb illegal immigration.Ngobeni said every further delay deepens social tensions, weakens accountability, and tells law-abiding South Africans that their government lacks the political courage to lead.On Thursday, IOL reported that the Helen Suzman Foundation welcomed the extension of both the Zimbabwean and Lesotho Exemption Permits, saying it would prevent potential humanitarian harm and allow time for a more sustainable policy framework to be developed.According to the Foundation, the extension will allow current ZEP and LEP holders to remain lawfully in South Africa while the minister conducts nationwide consultations. This follows a 2023 Pretoria High Court ruling in which HSF successfully challenged a previous decision to terminate the ZEP programme without prior notice or public consultation.The ministers directive clarifies that ZEP and LEP holders cannot be arrested, detained, or deported under section 34 of the Immigration Act due to an invalid exemption certificate. Holders may also freely enter or depart South Africa under immigration regulations and will not need to produce a valid exemption certificate when applying for another visa category under section 10(2) of the Act.\n\nIn a statement, ActionSA parliamentary chief whip Lerato Ngobeni MP said the extension showed the governments unwillingness to confront South Africas immigration crisis head-on.\n\nSouth Africa does not need endless extensions.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA HARARE magistrate has issued a warrant of arrest for socialite Admire Mushambi, popularly known as Mama Vee, after he failed to show up and give his testimony regarding the now-infamous E-Creator Ponzi scheme that swindled thousands of unsuspecting Zimbabweans.\n\nMagistrate Francis Mapfumo issued the warrant after Mushambi failed to appear in court, where his associate, fellow socialite Tarisai Madam Boss Chikocho, was testifying.Chikocho said Mishambi is the one who introduced her to the Chinese accused of duping unsuspecting clients.The Chinese nationals Jao Zhao Jiatong and Willian Chui, are accused of allegedly masterminding the multimillion-dollar pyramid scheme.The State says the pair lured the public into investing in a fake online platform that promised unrealistic returns.Jiatong and Chui created E-Creator with the intention to dupe unsuspecting people, the State said.They misrepresented that investors would realise huge profits from their deposits when, in truth, no such investment platform existed.According to the State, victims were encouraged to send money through various EcoCash lines allegedly controlled by the accused. The funds amounting to over US$250,000 were later withdrawn and converted into cryptocurrency.The court also heard that the accused later roped in another man, only identified as Billy, to help process the illicit transactions, while EcoCash agent Blessing Julias handled some of the withdrawals.During her testimony, Madam Boss told the court that Mushambi was the one who introduced her to the E-Creator scheme.I can recall that sometime in June 2023, I was informed by Mushambi that the accused (Jiatong and Chui) wanted me to market their company, which they said was an investment platform, she said.She told the court that she and her manager, Fanwell Masunugure, met the accused at their Joina City offices.They told us they wanted us to advertise their company and invite Zimbabweans to invest through the supplied link for profit. I then advertised their company on my Facebook page together with Mushambi the same day I met them. I was paid US$700 for the services.Chikocho added that she even invested US$100 into the scheme herself and encouraged her husband and relatives to join.The E-Creator scam, which collapsed last year, left thousands counting their losses. With Mushambi now on the run, the court battle over who helped promote the fraudulent operation has taken a dramatic new turn.\n\nMagistrate Francis Mapfumo issued the warrant after Mushambi failed to appear in court, where his associate, fellow socialite Tarisai Madam Boss Chikocho, was testifying.\n\nChikocho said Mishambi is the one who introduced her to the Chinese accused of duping unsuspecting clients.The Chinese nationals Jao Zhao Jiatong and Willian Chui, are accused of allegedly masterminding the multimillion-dollar pyramid scheme.The State says the pair lured the public into investing in a fake online platform that promised unrealistic returns.Jiatong and Chui created E-Creator with the intention to dupe unsuspecting people, the State said.They misrepresented that investors would realise huge profits from their deposits when, in truth, no such investment platform existed.According to the State, victims were encouraged to send money through various EcoCash lines allegedly controlled by the accused.
