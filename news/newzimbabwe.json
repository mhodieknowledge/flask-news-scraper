            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nYEARS after promising theresuscitation of ZISCO Steel, the government is struggling to proffer a once-off solution to bring back the firm to its hey days.\n\nZISCO Steel was once a major steel producer in Zimbabwe, but it faced financial difficulties, mismanagement, and a lack of investment, leading to its closure in 2008.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament recently, Industry and Commerce Minister, Mangaliso Ndlovu struggled to point outany tangible progress made to revive the entity, tabling sketchy plans.\n\nNdlovu was being quizzed by Mbizo legislator, Corban Madziwanyika.\n\nThe coming on board of Dinson Iron and Steel Company currently presents a unique opportunity to build synergies with the existing ZISCO Company plant and other downstream industries such as Lancashire, hence promoting the revival of the local iron and steel sector, said Ndlovu.\n\nHe said currently, there are three key initiatives being undertaken by the government in resuscitating ZISCO and supporting Lancashire Steel. The first one, he said, is the reviving of the wire mill plant at Lancashire Steel whichwill see the manufacturing of wire rods, drawn wire, weld wire and brick force, barbed wire as well as galvanised wire.\n\nThe Industry Minister said the initiative is expected to create more than 20 jobs and provide wire-related products to both up and downstream industries and generate revenue for the company.\n\nThe second one is the establishment of a limestone beneficiation plant at BIMCO. The plant will manufacture burnt lime, aggregate stones for construction and mill limestone into different products. As the House might be aware, we had Kuvimba which had a management contract that has since been terminated owing to non-performance by the contractor.\n\nThis therefore means that the ZISCO board and management have regained urgency to manage and control its own affairs and we welcome this development at this critical juncture, he said.\n\nNdlovu said the government is now closer to inking an MOU that ensures that companies in the steel sector do not compete in producing the same products but rather, complement each other.\n\nDinson produces pig iron and steel billets for exports and will soon be producing the second stage of hot rolled wires and rolling bars. They have agreed in principle to leave certain types to be produced by ZISCO Steel and these are the shafts, the wire, the beams, the angles and the flat sections.\n\nThe entire sector will leverage the emergence of Dinson Company, which has started production of pig irons and steel billets. I want to submit by concluding that for their part, ZISCO Steel is currently mobilising resources to revive one of their kins for limestone beneficiation into burnt lime or what we call quick lime, which is used to remove impurities in steel making and is also used in construction such as cement manufacturing, added Ndlovu.\n\n",

            "content": "By Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThis story was originally published byGlobal Press Journal.\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  A year ago, all 16 checkout lanes were packed at OK Zimbabwe supermarket in Harare, one of the major retailers in the country. Customers queued shoulder to shoulder, their carts filled with Zimbabwes pantry essentials. Today, just two tills are open. They serve only a handful of customers who pick from whats available on half-empty shelves.\n\nAcross Zimbabwe, the situation is the same in many retail shops. While some are still holding on, their shelves are increasingly empty, with branches closing one by one. Others have folded operations entirely, unable to compete with informal traders.\n\nIt never used to be like this, says Mercy, who has worked for OK Zimbabwe for over 10 years and asked not to be referred to by her full name for fear of losing her job. People are not coming to buy from us.\n\nZimbabwes formal retail sector struggles to hang on due to a combination of factors that have been gradually escalating. At the heart of the issue is the countrys unstable currency system. In 2024, the government introduced Zimbabwean gold, or ZiG, meant to be a stable successor to the unreliable Zimbabwean dollar. The ZiG, which is tied to gold and foreign reserves, would  the government hoped  curb inflation and restore confidence in a local currency, which has long been in competition with the much-preferred United States dollar.\n\nZimbabwean gold surpassed many peoples expectations,but it was no magic cure for the countrys economic turmoil.In the black market, whose unofficial exchange rates most people use, the currency was in short supply and struggled to hold value. Six months after its introduction, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe slashed the official exchange rate by more than 40%, trying to bring it closer to the black market rate.\n\nMeanwhile, the government also put restrictions on formal retailers. It required them to price their goods within the official exchange rate and criminalized selling above the rate. This led to price hikes.\n\nRetail customers turned to informal markets where they could pay in the US dollars they still preferred, and at the more reasonable black market exchange rate.\n\nOnce busy, many formal retailers across Zimbabwe have folded operations amid economic turmoil, an unstable currency system, and increased competition from the informal sector.Photo credit: Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nInstability is likely to continue, as US dollars become scarce following the pullout of aid from the United States, much of it funnelled through the US Agency for International Development,which has been a key source of foreign currency inflows in Zimbabwe.\n\nMirriam Masikati, who once preferred supermarkets for their quality of goods, says she gets more value at these informal markets. It is worrying that I might buy fake products without knowing, but the prices are pushing us to these informal markets, says the mother of three.\n\nAlthough the government in April repealed the requirement that formal retailers price their goods within the official exchange rate, after nearly one year the damage had already been done. Major retailers like Spar Zimbabwe and N Richards Group folded some branches in parts of the capital. A statement by the Confederation of Zimbabwean Retailers in January indicated that some shops had reduced their space by 60%.\n\nAnd in April, OK Zimbabwe issued a loss warning, laying out a goal to raise US$30 million and explaining the financial challenges it has experienced in the last six months, including difficulty maintaining stock, paying suppliers and meeting other financial obligations.\n\nIn contrast, business is booming for informal traders  who are a significant part of the informal sector that makes up an estimated 65% of Zimbabwes economy and contributed about 72% to the countrys gross domestic product in 2024. They already had a good slice of the market. They now capture a larger share.\n\nThat share could grow further. Informal traders often sell out due to high demand, says Admire Musa, a cashier at one such shop in Harare. The success has attracted other Zimbabweans to open similar shops, he says.\n\nManufacturers, who once supplied formal retailers on credit, also are turning to informal traders, who pay in US cash, according to a 2024 report by the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThis also allows manufacturers to bypass the banking system and avoid taxes, says Brains Muchemwa, an economist. Such high levels of back-channel commerce could be a problem for the country, he says. It significantly reduces the governments tax revenue, as informal traders do not comply with regulations, he adds.\n\nA 2022 report by the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority indicates that less than 0.5% of the money made in the informal sector is collected as tax revenue.\n\nIt is worrying that I might buy fake products without knowing, but the prices are pushing us to these informal markets. Mirriam Masikati\n\nThe government has tried to address the growing levels of informalization. In February, it issued a monetary policy requiring that all businesses use point-of-sale machines. This would bring informal trade into regular banking channels.\n\nBut Muchemwa is skeptical. The informal sector thrives because it can avoid the burdens of regulations, he says. Without stable policies and an encouraging trading environment, the governments efforts will not yield anything, he says.\n\nProsper Chitambara, also an economist, says the country needs tax reforms that make it easier and cheaper for businesses to formalize. He points to Brazil and Uruguay as successful examples where simplified tax regimes and supportive laws have reduced informality.\n\nFor Muchemwa, the solution is simple. As long as we defy the logic in terms of managing the economy, in particular printing money and coming up with policies that are not sensible, it will continue to present challenges for this economy, he says.\n\nThe countrys struggling economy is a chance for retailers to adapt, says Mthandazo Mlotshwa, chief operating officer for Zapalala Supermarkets. Though Zapalala closed some of its branches, Mlotshwa remains optimistic and doesnt see the informal market as a threat. Still, regulation and stable currency rates are needed, he adds, and the government is taking steps in that direction.\n\nMeanwhile, Mercy and other workers in retail remain anxious about their future. Everyone is demotivated, some have lost their jobs, and for us who remain the salaries are not coming on time and sometimes you get a portion of your salary, she says, her voice lowered in frustration.\n\nGamuchirai Masiyiwais a Reporter-in-Residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.\n\nGlobal Press Journal delivers bold, investigative and in-depth explanatory reporting on the worlds most urgent issues.\n\n",

Ltd, a key requirement under the tender conditions.\n\nThe accused, in collusion with City of Harare officials ex-Director of Works Phillip Pfukwa and former Chamber Secretary Josephine Ncube, both already in remand on related charges, allegedly manipulated payment processes to receive funds before completing the project.\n\nThe funds were deposited into Synlaks CABS and BancABC accounts, from which Vusumuzi and Nobukhosi, as signatories, made cash withdrawals.\n\nPfukwa and Ncube were arrested earlier last month and remanded out of custody.\n\nThey also stand accused of bypassing procedure, falsifying council memos, misrepresenting Synlaks capacity and awarding it the tender despite having received four other bids.\n\nThe matter came to light after acting Town Clerk Mabhena Moyo reported the matter to ZACC.\n\n",
