            "content": "Xinhua\n\nKirsty Coventry, poised to become the first woman and the first African to lead the International Olympic Committee, has laid out her vision for the future of the Olympic Movement, grounded in its core values and potential for global unity.\n\nCoventry, elected in March during the 144th IOC Session in Greece, will assume the presidency on June 23, succeeding Thomas Bach, who has led the organization since 2013. She received 49 of 97 votes in the first round, prevailing over six other candidates.\n\nValues are what have led this movement for over a hundred years. Its whats kept this movement intertwined together. And that is something that we can never compromise, the 41-year-old Zimbabwean told the Olympic Channel at the Olympic House in Lausanne on Thursday.\n\nWe have to be proud that were a movement that not just lives by its values, but shares its values, and promotes its values, Coventry said.\n\nAnd if we can find more ways to do that in the future, and can reach all households around the world, thats part of my goal. How do we have more reach to communities across our massive globe? How do we reach those children to share our values with them? How do we reach them to inspire them?\n\nDespite the weight of expectations that accompany the role, Coventry expressed enthusiasm about the opportunity to lead.\n\nI dont really look at the presidency as a weight, she said. Are there a lot of expectations? Yes. Does that come with a lot of responsibility? Yes. But Im really so honored to have been given this opportunity, and Im so excited for what the future holds. Its a movement that has been a part of my life for so long, so it almost feels like a very natural progression.\n\nCoventrys deep ties to the Olympics began with her storied swimming career. She competed in five consecutive Games beginning in Sydney 2000, winning seven medals  including two golds  and becoming Africas most decorated Olympian. Her return to Zimbabwe after her Olympic success, during a time of national difficulty, further cemented her belief in sports transformative power.\n\nIn addition to her achievements in the pool, Coventry has played a key role in sports governance. She joined the IOC as an athlete member in 2013, chaired the Athletes Commission, served on the Executive Board, and led initiatives promoting safe sports environments for children through the Kirsty Coventry Academy and the HEROES programme in Zimbabwe.\n\nShe also served as Zimbabwes Minister of Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation from 2018, during which she pushed legislation aimed at curbing match-fixing, abuse, and sexual harassment in sport.\n\nBalancing her new role with her home life as the mother of two young daughters has been a challenge, she admitted.\n\nIt has been crazy. And its been hard, but its also been wonderful, Coventry said.\n\nI have a lot more patience, she added. I now realize I can do a lot more with a lot less sleep. [The children] humble you. And when you get home after a rough day, you can look at them and you can realize, Okay, this is why were doing this. But were also doing this so that the Olympic Games and our values remain relevant in this crazy world of ours. Theyre the meaning.\n\n",

He then realised that the gun had discharged on its own accord when he saw the smoke on the mouth of the barrel, signalling recent gunfire.\n\nAt the same time, he observed the deceased, who was in a bent position, falling backwards.\n\nIn convicting him, the judge said the manner in which the events unfolded portrays mere carelessness rather than recklessness.\n\nThe accuseds action of taking safety precautionary measures in a confined space borders on negligence rather than out of realisation of risk or possibility that death may ensue out of his conduct of leaving an unsupervised semi-loaded gun for a short stint of time, noted the judge before convicting Mutefara.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA psychiatric patient who had previously served jailtimefor murder has killed two more victims following hisrelease.\n\nThe accused is Jealous Tomasi, a documented psychiatric patient, who was released into the public domain after a 12-year imprisonment at Chikurubis psychiatric unit.\n\nHe had been committed to the psychiatric ward after a special verdict on a murder he committed in 2008 whilst mentally incapacitated.\n\nTwo years after his release, whilst showing some normalcy, he committed two other murders and was brought before the High Court.\n\nThis time, he stands charged with two counts of murder in terms of s47 of the Criminal Code [Chapter 9:23].\n\nThe evidence adduced shows that the relapse was caused by a lack of consistency or his total neglect to take his prescribed medication.\n\nHowever, it is apparent that he had, to a certain extent, resumed normal life and had joined some artisanal mining syndicates.\n\nIt is alleged that on the 29th of September 2022, after the accused had retired to bed in the company of his girlfriend, an altercation arose from outside his make-shift cabin at the mining site.\n\nAccused awakened and was promptly and impulsively steered into action by uninvitedly joining in the fight.\n\nSomehow, he then snapped and axed one of the culprits, the court heard.\n\nAnother neighbour who was attracted to the scene by the commotion was also savagely axed to death.\n\nTomasi was arrested after he had fled the scene, giving rise to this criminal trial.\n\nHe has been held at the Chikurubi Psychiatric Unit since the 12th of July 2023, in terms of sections 27 and 28 of the Mental Health Act [Chapter 15:12].\n\nThe affidavit compiled by the psychiatric doctor, Dr. S. W. Mazorodze, who evaluated the accused on the 25th of February, 2025 chronicles his mental history and his current mental disposition.\n\nAgainst the background of the accuseds mental history and relapse, the case proceeded as a Stated Case.\n\nA statement of agreed facts was submitted.\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Catherine Bachi-Muzavazi, sitting with two assessors, quizzed Tomasi as to ascertain, assess and confirm whether he appreciated what was going on and was fit to stand trial.\n\nWe noted that he appeared mentally stable.\n\nThis is owed to the strict supervision by the prison psychiatric staff officers who ensured and superintended adherence to the prescribed drug regime, said Muzavazi.\n\nThe judge said what is apparent is that such supervision and assistance were lacking when the accused was initially certified fit for release from the mental institution the first time around.\n\nTwo more lives were lost because of that negligence.\n\nThere is no evidence that there are people willing to take care of him or supervise him, as can be deduced from the record of proceedings.\n\nAfter release, he mingled with artisanal miners and was freelancing as an artisanal miner.\n\nMuzavazi said in the circumstances of this case, the dilemma or predicament the court finds itself in is that there is a very recent report mentioned earlier on after the accused had undergone mental treatment and evaluation certifying his fitness to be released in the custody of one John Madzengerwa, his nephew.\n\nOn the other hand, though the accused does have some lucid moments or intervals, the commission of this offence shows that there is no guarantee that he will not once again turn into a serial killer.\n\nIt will be akin to releasing a loose cannon or a time bomb waiting to explode with dire consequences.\n\nHe is a danger not only to himself but to his community and the society at large.\n\nThat being the case, we strongly feel that mental evaluation and certification by a single expert, though respected, is not sufficient.\n\nThe accused needs to go under further management and treatment, she said.\n\nAccording to the court, the authorities mentioned in s29 of the Act must comply with the provisions of s29(4) to 29(7), speaking to the mandate to place the accused before a special board which will in turn place him before the Mental Health Review Tribunal.\n\nThe court ruled that until such time the accuseds mental state has been reviewed by the Mental Health Review Tribunal and appropriate recommendations have been made in terms of the stipulated procedures as dictated by the Mental Health Act, the accused is not to be released.\n\nAccused is accordingly ordered to be returned to prison for transfer to the Chikurubi Mental institution for further management as ordered above and as prescribed by Section 29 of the Mental Health Act, ruled Muzavazi.\n\n",

RBZ officials noted that bolstering gold reserves not only underpins the currency but also enhances resilience to global financial instability.\n\nAs geopolitical uncertainty rises, many countries are turning to gold as a stable asset. Zimbabwe, as a significant gold producer, is well positioned to follow this global trend, a central bank official said.\n\nThe initiative reflects broader international patterns, with countries such as China, Russia and Turkey also increasing their gold holdings to hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations.\n\nAccording to official figures, Zimbabwe produced more than 30 tonnes of gold in 2024, with a growing share retained by the RBZ under the reserve accumulation strategy.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nPARLIAMENT is divided over the motion for Zimbabwe to adopt a legal framework for a National Ideology, which opposition legislators have condemned as the ZANU-fication of the country, warning it could lead to the suppression of government critics.\n\nRecently, ZANU PF Member of Parliament (MP) Joseph Mapiki tabled a motion for the National Assembly to debate the adoption of a national ideology across Zimbabwean society.\n\nAccording to Mapiki, the National Ideology would entrench patriotism and Zimbabwean identity.\n\nHowever, the proposal has angered opposition legislators, who fear the legal framework could be used to restrict democratic freedoms.\n\nCitizens Coalition for Change (CCC) MP Lynnette Karenyi-Kore argued that if passed, the law would be weaponised against opposition members.\n\nOur Constitution guarantees freedom of thought, opinion and expression. To enforce patriotism legally would infringe upon these basic rights, Madam Speaker.\n\nCreating a legal framework compelling ideological loyalty undermines democracy and pluralism through thriving on diversity of opinion. The dangers of institutionalising ideology are as follows: An ideology institution sounds disturbing.\n\nHistory has shown us that once States begin controlling ideology, State abuse, censorship and suppression of dissent follow. Decisiveness and weaponisation risk, it is also going to be one of the challenges, said Karenyi.\n\nZANU PF is pushing to nationalise the ideological school concept it established within its party. The ruling party has previously proposed enrolling civil servants into the Herbert Chitepo School of Ideology.\n\nThe National Ideology would also be incorporated into the school curriculum, with patriotism as a core component of education from primary to tertiary level.\n\nCCC legislator Gladys Hlatywayo warned that the proposal risks being hijacked by ZANU PFs interests rather than serving the nation.\n\nTerms such as national interest are often euphemisms for advancing party interest and the interest of the ruling class or ruling elite. In this case, legislating patriotism might be legislating the zanufication of the State.\n\nThere is also a danger that legislating patriotism can erode civil liberties and restrict freedoms of speech, assembly and association. These civil liberties are at the heart of any democratic society and encoded in our own Bill of Rights, in our own Constitution, and must therefore be protected and protected rather than taken away by opaque, divisive and undemocratic laws under the guise of legislative patriotism.\n\nThe proposed prayer by the mover of the motion also has a chilling effect on public discourse Madam Speaker. Open, honest public debate that is so instrumental to democratic development might be discouraged as fear grips the country, said Hlatywayo.\n\n",
