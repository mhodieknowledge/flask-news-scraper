            "content": "The Economic Times\n\nHMPV cases are now reportedly rising in Malaysia. In 2024, 327 HMPV cases were reported in the country, a 45% increase compared to 225 cases in 2023.\n\nThis increase comes amidst reports of rising respiratory illnesses in other countries, including China.\n\nHMPV is a respiratory infection caused by a virus in the -Pneumoviridae- family. Symptoms often resemble a common cold, but severe cases can develop into bronchitis or pneumonia.\n\nAccording to the Straits Times, Malaysias Health Ministry urged the public to practice preventive measures, including frequent handwashing with soap, wearing face masks, and covering the mouth and nose when coughing or sneezing.\n\nThe public is advised to proactively take care of their health and prevent infection to others, especially in enclosed and crowded areas, the ministry stated.\n\nThis includes those planning to travel to countries at risk.\n\nHowever, the ministry emphasized that HMPV is not a new disease.\n\nFAQ: Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV)\n\nWhat is Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV)?\n\nDiscovered in 2001, HMPV belongs to the Pneumoviridae family, the same family as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). It is a respiratory virus that typically causes upper and lower respiratory infections, with symptoms resembling the common cold or flu.\n\nWhy is HMPV in the news?\n\nChina is currently experiencing a surge in HMPV cases, alongside other respiratory illnesses like influenza A, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and COVID-19.\n\nReports suggest hospitals in some regions are overwhelmed, but Chinese authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) have not declared a state of emergency.\n\nWho is most at risk from HMPV?\n\nHMPV can affect people of all ages, but the most vulnerable groups include:\n\nChildren under five, particularly infants. Older adults, especially those over 65.\n\nPeople with weakened immune systems or chronic respiratory conditions like asthma or COPD.\n\nHow does HMPV spread?\n\nHMPV spreads through: Respiratory droplets from coughing or sneezing.\n\nClose contact, such as shaking hands or touching someone infected.\n\nContact with contaminated surfaces, followed by touching the mouth, nose, or eyes.\n\nThe virus often circulates seasonally, peaking in late winter and spring in temperate regions.\n\nWhat are the symptoms of HMPV?\n\nAccording to the CDC, symptoms include:\n\nCough and runny or stuffy nose, fever, sore throat, wheezing or shortness of breath in severe cases.\n\nIn more serious cases, it can escalate to bronchitis, pneumonia, or asthma exacerbations.\n\nHow is HMPV diagnosed?\n\nTesting is rare unless symptoms are severe or part of an outbreak. Diagnostic methods include: Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT): Detects viral genome in respiratory secretions.\n\nImmunofluorescence or Enzyme Immunoassay: Detects viral antigens.\n\nHow can HMPV be prevented?\n\nThe CDC recommends the following precautions:\n\nIs there a treatment for HMPV?\n\nThere is no specific antiviral treatment or vaccine for HMPV. Symptom management includes:\n\nHow does HMPV compare to COVID-19?\n\nBoth HMPV and COVID-19 cause respiratory symptoms such as coughing, fever, congestion, and shortness of breath. They also spread through respiratory droplets.\n\nHMPV: Peaks during winter and spring.\n\nCOVID-19: Spreads year-round due to evolving variants.\n\nPost-COVID-19 lockdowns, surges in HMPV cases have been observed as populations re-expose themselves to respiratory pathogens.\n\nWhen should you seek medical attention?\n\nIs HMPV a new pandemic threat?\n\nNo, HMPV is not a new virus or an imminent pandemic threat. Seasonal surges are common, particularly during the winter months. However, the increase in cases post-COVID-19 restrictions has raised concerns.\n\n",

The Road Freight Association said the disruptions at the ports of entry cost South Africa R10 million a day.\n\nTanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan chaired Sundays virtual meeting, also attended by Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema and Malawis Lazarus Chakwera, the other troika members. Nyusi and SADC executive secretary Elias Magosi also attended.\n\nAt the meeting, Hichilema said the conflict is not only affecting the people of Mozambique but also hindering regional trade in critical sectors like energy and transport.\n\nOpposition candidate Venancio Mondlane disputes the election, in which ruling FRELIMO was declared the winner.\n\nThe United Nations Refugee Agency (UNHCR) says more than 2,000 people have fled Mozambique into neighbouring Malawi while another 1,000 have fled to Eswatini.\n\nMondlane, who has been directing the protests from Europe via Facebook, has vowed to return to the country on Thursday. He says he will be inaugurated on January 15 as the countrys legitimate leader.\n\nHowever, divisions have emerged between Mondlane and PODEMO, the party that backed him, over whether opposition MPs should take up their seats in Parliament.\n\n",

Beta said it was investing in two plants, in Mt Hampden and Melfort, hoping to increase capacity from 6 million bricks a month to 24 million a month. But thin capital has seen production fall over recent years. In 2023, the company said it was failing to pay workers at Mt Hampden due to unprecedented challenges.\n\nThe company had taken out loans, including from banks, and is failing to pay them off. By November, was had arrears of US$1.2 million on its loans. Says Beta: The company is therefore potentially liable, jointly, and severally, to settle the outstanding balance in the sum of US$9,620,743.25. The potential liability comes at a time when the company is not generating any revenue, which can be used to settle the claim.\n\nThe board believes the company can still be saved, and that given the current construction boom in the country, there is high demand for products manufactured by the company.\n\nCompetition is rising in the brick business, with new, smaller and nimbler players eating away at the market share of dominant brick makers, at a time demand for bricks is strong.\n\nAnother company, Willdale, is selling idle land to raise money for a new plant, which it needs to catch up with thriving competitors. Willdales old plants and high costs have seen it struggle to meet orders from customers.\n\n",

Without being specific where the moratorium will be applied, Garwe said CoH has been directed to halt the impending demolition of over 5,000 housing units.\n\nStop it as it emerges. Why wait for someone to build and then demolish? Let us be morally correct.\n\nNo 5,000 houses are going to be demolished by the city (Harare) and to make matters worse, who gave them those pieces of land? Is it not the corrupt council officials? Garwe said.\n\nHe added, We are against demolishing. Where were you as a City Father when this piece of land was being sold? We cannot be more stupid than that. Definitely, we cannot, the minister said.\n\nRecently, residents lost homes in Belvedere where CoH demolished several upmarket properties as owners haplessly watched in the presence of the police.\n\n",

We are now in the process of inviting private sector players, both local and international, to bring proposals, expressions of interest. These are going to be unsolicited bids.\n\nWe want somebody with the capacity to engineer, to procure, to construct and manage the finance. Thats the model that we are working on. Engineering, procurement, construction, management and finance.\n\nThese are unsolicited bids. So, as we speak, weve already received about five expressions of interest from local players and three from international players. So, its work in progress, Garwe said.\n\nHe was hoping that by the end of next week, his ministry would have identified and interviewed all interested players.\n\nBy end of next week, we would have identified the most suitable people that have applied and appointed them, at least signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU), and then a Memorandum of Agreement.\n\nWe want by the end of this month to have dealt with the issue of water in Harare, added Garwe.\n\nHe said a lot of purified water was being lost through leakages.\n\nBy the time it reaches a resident, its just a fraction of what has been purified. We are looking at an investor who comes and covers the whole value chain, from purification to distribution to billing and metering.\n\nWe want to move away from the old metre system to digital metre systems, the smart water metering systems. Thats what we are doing, he stated.\n\nGarwe promised that by the end of this month or early February, there will be movement in this regard not in Harare alone but in all urban councils countrywide.\n\nWe are looking at all our cities. We have started, but the invitations are not focused on Harare, they are focused on all the urban cities.\n\nPriority areas are Harare, Bulawayo and Victoria Falls.\n\nBesides the privatisation of water services, government will also privatise all other services such as solid and liquid waste management systems to make sure cases of burst pipes are dealt with once and for all.\n\nChitungwiza and most of Harares suburbs have gone for years with raw sewage flowing in residential areas.\n\nGarwe urged journalists to wait for the Commission of Inquiry to complete its investigations on Harare City regarding some allegations.\n\nLet the Commission do its work and then we can find a way forward, said Garwe.\n\nThe minister also explained that the privatisation of public services in urban councils was not coming at a premium to residents.\n\nTechnology is cheaper.

In cooperation with relevant authorities, a full investigation into the incident is currently underway.\n\nTefoma has offered its full support and is working closely with Manzlink, the employer, and the deceaseds family during this difficult time.\n\nThe board of directors and management team remain committed to maintaining the highest safety standards across all our project sites.\n\nThe recently re-named Trabablas Interchange, which was previously known as Mbudzi roundabout, upon completion is expected to have gobbled US$88 million. Initially scheduled to be completed in 2024, the timelines have been further extended to 2025. Trabablas was President Emmerson Mnangagwas wartime nickname.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nRENOWNED lawyer, Thabani Mpofu has poked holes into President Emmerson Mnangagwas decision to extend General Philip Valerio Sibandas term of office as the Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) by one year.\n\nSibanda, who turned 70 on December 24, 2024, officially reached the mandatory retirement age, which, according to Mpofu, renders any extension of his term invalid.\n\nPosting on social media, Mpofu described Mnangagwas decision as flawed since the concerned official had already reached the retirement age and, therefore, could not simultaneously hold an active position.\n\nMnangagwa has now purported to extend General Sibandas appointment until November 23, 2025, through General Notice 15 of 2025, issued on January 3, 2025. This decision is flawed for two reasons:\n\nExpired Term: A term that has already expired cannot be extended. Thats why there are no oxygen canisters at the cemetery.\n\nRetirement Age: General Sibanda has reached the mandatory retirement age of 70. He cannot be retired and in active service at the same time. It is one thing to recycle dead wood, it is quite another to plant a dead log, said Mpofu.\n\nThe latest development, viewed as a power consolidation strategy as Mnangagwa reportedly seeks a third presidential term, is in Mpofus opinion a troubling trend.\n\nWhat a way to start a year! And for Mnangagwa, what a way to perpetuate a disgraceful legacy anchored on absurdities and illegalities, said Mpofu.\n\nSibanda has served as the Commander of the ZDF since 2017, succeeding the current Vice President, Constantino Chiwenga, who previously held the position.\n\n",
