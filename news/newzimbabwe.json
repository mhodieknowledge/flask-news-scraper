Congratulations to Bongeka Mbokodo Mguni, she is just 17 but she is on a mission to win, inspire and change the narrative that persons with albinism cannot compete in mainstream sports, wrote Tshuma.\n\nBongeka is a decorated young sports girl who has already bagged many accolades in karate. She is living proof that albinism is not a limitation, she too belongs in the arena without fear or favour.\n\nAmhlophe, congratulations, makorokoto for representing Zimbabwe with decorum and pride. She won us a whole silver medal on the under 65kgs karate tournament during the 2025 AU Region 5 Youth Games in Namibia this weekend.\n\nThank you to all who supported her on this.

Its a bumpy pitch and its making life difficult for the players.\n\nI hope the authorities do something about this. It is getting worse every week.\n\nI think its because of overuse, I dont know but something has to be done, said Scottland FC coach Tonderai Ndiraya.\n\n",
