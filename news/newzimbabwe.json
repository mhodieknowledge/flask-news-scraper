Setting up a registration procedure is an important goal for multinational satellite operators that want to offer services directly or through partnerships with approved local suppliers.\n\nWhen asked by IOL about the biggest spreader of misinformation on X, Grok said:  Based on available reports, analyses, and sentiment on X as of March 07, 2025, Elon Musk is frequently identified as one of the most significant spreaders of misinformation on the platform.\n\nGrok added that this assessment comes from various sources, including studies by organisations like the Center for Countering Digital Hate, which found that Musks posts promoting false or misleading claims about topics like the US election have amassed billions of views in 2024 alone.\n\nHis large followingover 200 million as of recent countsamplifies the reach of such content, often related to politics, health issues like Covid-19, and conspiracy theories.\n\nThe AI further elaborated, noting that Musks interactions with accounts known for spreading misinformation have been highlighted as contributing factors.\n\n",

The enduring legacy of their work will be felt for generations, both in the lives of those they have helped and in the healthcare system they have contributed to building.\n\nKwidini added that Chinese medical teams exemplify the power of compassion, collaboration, and dedication.\n\nCheng Yan, charge daffaires of the Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe, said the milestone not only marks four decades of unwavering dedication and service to Zimbabwe by Chinese medical teams, but is also a testament to the enduring friendship between the two countries.\n\nTheir efforts embody the spirit of Chinas vision for a global community of health for all, and demonstrate that their mission is not just about treating illness, but about building bridges of friendship between our peoples, he said.\n\nCheng said China and Zimbabwe maintain close exchanges in medical personnel training, adding that China will invite more than 60 Zimbabwean hospital staff and medical officials to visit China this year.\n\nOver the past year, the 21st batch of the Chinese medical team has treated over 14,000 patients, trained more than 1,000 local health workers, and established critical health facilities.\n\n",

We found that the party has suffered a lot of harm from what goes on on social media.\n\nWhat we do not approve is a Zanu PF cadre, a member of Zanu PF from the cell right up to the president, use social media to criticise colleagues. The channels are there. We are hopeful the social media policy that is to be crafted will assist not entirely or help assist put order and discipline and unity within our party, said Chinamasa.\n\nZanu PF has been struggling to contain its members and affiliates, some of which were ostensibly created to support President Emmerson Mnangagwa. One of the affiliates, Varakashi for ED, recently criticised Chinamasa after he warned them about bringing the party into disrepute.\n\nThey have been accused of fanning factionalism, going against President Mnangagwas public declaration of not seeking re-election.\n\nDespite some of the affiliates having been established to counter the narrative of the opposition using digital media, some have reflected Zanu PFs divisions, with members split between supporting Mnangagwa and his deputy, Constantino Chiwenga, who is touted to be next in the partys succession plan.\n\nChinamasa said once the digital media policy has been approved, Zanu PF will nip in the bud any members going against the party.\n\nThe party is going to put its foot down on issues to do with WhatsApp exchanges. We have developed technology to detect who are the ghost people. A lot of people have been masquerading under ghost accounts. We have technology to tell who is a ghost. This time we will be able to uncover who are the ghosts doing all these things, he said.\n\nZanu PF recently purged and suspended members who were accused of spreading divisive messages using social media.\n\n",

He believed in the truth, in justice and in giving a voice to the unheard.\n\nDozens of colleagues from the BBC, the UK-Zimbabwe media fraternity, as well as family and friends attended Machipisas funeral service and burial last Thursday at the Kemnal Park Cemetery & Memorial Gardens in London.\n\nUK-based global risk solutions provider,Diaspora Insurance, sponsored the live broadcasting of the funeral service.\n\nTributes from colleagues and friends captured the fascinating contrast between the seriousness of Machipisas impactful journalism and his humble, unassuming and happy-go character.\n\nIfhakuna matata (no worries) was a person, that was Lewis; just unbothered, explained long-time friend and colleague Innocent Chifamba Sithole.\n\nLewis lived authentically  no frills, just Lewis. He represented the lighter side of life. He was sunshine and what I mean by that is you wouldnt be talking to Lewis if you were not smiling and laughing.\n\nViolet Gonda, another contemporary of Machipisa added, Lewis was a very close friend; I used to call him MaChips.\n\nHe was just a fun-loving guy and I remember the last time I saw him was at the UK Zimbabwe Achievers Awards. He is the one who made the whole event so entertaining.\n\nHe wouldnt keep quiet and was just dancing throughout the evening; that was Lewis for you.\n\nLance Guma (right)\n\nNehanda Radios Lance Guma said, The guy (Lewis) was always making us laugh.\n\nI dont remember a single event I went to and did not leave with a sore set of ribs from the laughter. He was comedy gold; he knew how to make us laugh.\n\nWhile comedy defined how Machipisa related with family and friends, his journalism was anything but; it was serious, professional, impactful and inspirational.\n\nHopewell Chinono is another veteran journalist and long-time friend who attended the funeral. Chinono was in the same class at journalism school in Harare with Machipisa between 1991 and 1993.\n\nLewis was dedicated to his work to a point where he had to leave Zimbabwe and come into exile in the United Kingdom because he was being harassed by the then (Robert) Mugabe administration.\n\nChofamba Sithole added; He (Lewis) was an inspiration to me as a young journalist in Zimbabwe. I got to know him when he was already working with IPS and covering stories for global audiences.\n\nHe quickly followed that up with the BBC, reporting from hot spots such as South Sudan as it emerged to become Africas 54thindependent nation; Lewis was there to report and record that moment in history.\n\nHis voice is well known and beloved across the African continent which he reached out to through BBC World Service programmes such as Focus on Africa and Network Africa.\n\nHe (Lewis) was a pathfinder, concluded Professor Winston Mano of the University of Westminsters School of Media and Communication.\n\nHe introduced many of us to the BBC. A humble man and keen journalist but also somebody who was the soul of the party; always up for a good laugh.\n\nMachipisa, who was 53, passed on peacefully at his home in Catford, Southeast London, on Wednesday morning, January 8, 2025. He is survived by three children Dudu, Dumi, and Chikomborero.\n\n",
