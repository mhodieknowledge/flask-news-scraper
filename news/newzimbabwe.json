            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nHUMAN rights defenders have criticised the recent bombing of opposition leader Job Sikhalas Chitungwiza home, amid fears of a renewed wave of raids on properties linked to exiled Zimbabweans.\n\nThe alleged bombing of Sikhalas house while he was away in South Africa raises the spectre of a fresh campaign of political persecution, says human rights activist Munacho Humbasha.\n\nHe says the attack on Sikhalas house is a chilling message to critics of Zanu PF, both at home and abroad.\n\nSikhala, a former legislator and long-time government critic, has been frequenting South Africa for medical and political engagements.\n\nHumbasha told NewZimbabwe.com that Zanu PF functionaries and State security agents have openly declared war on activists in the diaspora, with families back home being deliberately targeted.\n\nThose with houses visited in the widening campaign and searches include that of Petty Ziramba, Panganayi Mauzinyu, Ralph Dube, Fransisca Chiduku, and Shepherd Yuda, said Humbasha.\n\nIn Mabvuku, unknown men believed to be State agents raided the home of the late opposition activist Tonderai Ndira. The assailants took household property and left the house empty, promising to return and destroy their livelihoods. The family is still in shock.\n\nIn Harare, suspected operatives broke into Blessing Makeyis house and again into his family home, allegedly searching for incriminating material. Makevi has been active in diaspora protests against President Emmerson Mnangagwas government, Humbasha told NewZimbabwe.com in an interview.\n\nAlso, another dissenter, Ralph Dubes family, is living in uncertainty after receiving threatening messages, says Humbasha.\n\nBack home, he further claimed, several homes in Seke, Chitungwiza, having been visited by suspicious individuals in recent days, thereby sparking fears in the community.\n\nDespite repeated reports of break-ins and intimidation, police have not arrested anyone in connection with the incidents. Efforts to get a comment from police national spokesman, Commissioner Paul Nyathi, were fruitless by the time of publishing.\n\nVictims and their families say the inaction points to the States complicity.\n\nThis is meant to punish those of us who are in the UK and elsewhere. Our families are being harassed everyday because we speak out, said UK-based activist, Melody Magejo, who spoke to NewZimbabwe.com in a telephone interview.\n\nA human rights lawyer, who preferred anonymity, said as Mnangagwa gravitates towards entrenching his rule through his 2030 agenda, the political environment is set to worsen.\n\nThe use of Patriotic Act and Cyber Security Act 2023 will lead to many arrests of those who are actively participating in campaigns on social media.\n\nIt is without a doubt that Mnangagwas government does not want the outside world to know what is happening in the country, said the lawyer.\n\n",

            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo | IOL\n\nThe Democratic Alliance (DA) has strongly criticised President Cyril Ramaphosas remarks praising Zimbabwes land reform programme during his visit to Harare last week.\n\nRamaphosa was in Zimbabwe at the invitation of President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, where he attended the annual Zimbabwe Agricultural Show as guest of honour. Speaking at the event, Ramaphosa congratulated Zimbabwe for reviving its agricultural sector through policy reforms, investment in irrigation, mechanisation, and empowering both large- and small-scale farmers.\n\nOn independence in 1980, the new democratic government of Zimbabwe had to take on the momentous task of dismantling colonial-era patterns of land ownership. Most of the countrys commercially productive land and large-scale farms were owned by whites. The black majority was confined to communal lands and excluded from commercial farming, said Ramaphosa.\n\nIt was therefore essential  for both historical redress and food security, development and economic growth  that the government embarked on ambitious reforms to facilitate the entry of black Zimbabweans into productive agriculture, including support to small-scale farmers.\n\nReacting to Ramaphosas remarks, DA national spokesperson and Member of Parliament Willie Aucamp said the president was wrongfully praising a programme that devastated Zimbabwes economy.\n\nThe DA condemns and rejects this praise by Ramaphosa for a process which left Zimbabwe in tatters, destroying its economy, destroying its foreign relations, and creating famine for its people, Aucamp said.\n\nHe argued that because land was not legally transferred, Zimbabwe was left with crippling financial reparations due to former farmers and landowners.\n\nRamaphosa is attempting to whitewash the disaster in Zimbabwe, to create momentum for the ANCs land expropriation agenda in terms of the Expropriation Act of 2025, Aucamp added.\n\nWhile acknowledging the need for land reform in South Africa, the DA insisted it must be pursued within the bounds of the Constitution and rule of law.\n\nThe DA firmly believes in the need to redress the injustices of the past, particularly through fair and lawful land reform that restores dignity and economic opportunity. However, this redress must occur within the bounds of the Constitution and the rule of law, which Expropriation Without Compensation does not meet, Aucamp said.\n\nHe further stressed that the Government of National Unity does not endorse Zimbabwes land confiscation model.\n\n",

The lack of clarity is creating devastating consequences, they said.\n\nAccording to HSF and CoRMSA, many Zimbabweans on the permit have already lost jobs, struggled to enrol their children for the 2026 school year, and faced difficulties accessing basic healthcare.

            "content": "Report Focus News\n\nZimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa met China Railway International Group executives Tuesday to finalise a $533 million infrastructure deal aimed at revitalizing the southern African nations deteriorating rail network.\n\nThe discussions focused on Zimbabwes digital future, including expanding investment in ICT talent, strengthening infrastructure, and introducing advanced technologies into the country. The meeting occurred as Mnangagwa arrived in Beijing to attend Wednesdays commemoration of the 80th anniversary of Japans World War Two surrender.\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncube confirmed the investment value during earlier negotiations. We believe that we could make use of their expertise and financial muscle to improve the NRZ, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube said in a weekend interview.\n\nThe deal involves TransTech Engineering Corporation, a China Railway International Group subsidiary with extensive African infrastructure experience. The company previously built the 1,860-kilometer Tanzania-Zambia railway and Ethiopias Addis Ababa-Djibouti line.\n\nZimbabwes rail network has declined sharply from its 1990s peak when it transported 12 million tons annually. National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) now hauls less than three million tons.\n\nThe infrastructure deterioration has severely impacted mineral exports, particularly from Chinese mining operations. Companies including Tsingshan Holdings, Sinosteel and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt face transportation constraints moving lithium, chrome and coal to ports.\n\nThe modernization project includes rehabilitation of existing lines, new signaling systems, acquisition of 17 locomotives and 209 freight wagons. Additionally, NRZ is exploring a partnership with the University of Zimbabwe to develop railway solutions through the universitys innovation hub.\n\nPhase one encompasses five new stations and a critical Beitbridge-Harare line connecting to South Africa, Zimbabwes largest trading partner.\n\nZimbabwe is on the verge of clinching a deal with the Chinese Railway Group so work on this critical enabler starts, presidential spokesman George Charamba said in Beijing.\n\nNRZ Public Relations and Stakeholder Manager Andrew Kunambura confirmed that the feasibility study has been completed and a report will be presented.\n\nThe project forms part of Zimbabwes broader rail strategy involving 11 private companies. South Africas Grindrod deployed three locomotives and 150 wagons through its Beitbridge Bulawayo Railway subsidiary since March 2024.\n\nChina remains Zimbabwes largest investor with total investments exceeding $4.4 billion. In 2024 alone, trade between the two countries reached US$3.8 billion  a 24% increase from the previous year.\n\nThe railway investment addresses Zimbabwes push to achieve its $12 billion mining industry target by improving mineral transport to Mozambique and South African ports for Asian markets.\n\nFunding mechanisms remain undisclosed, though analysts expect Chinese loans and contractor financing arrangements, adding to Zimbabwes existing debt obligations to Chinese entities.\n\nThe formal announcement was initially planned for the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in August but has been delayed pending final negotiations.\n\n",
