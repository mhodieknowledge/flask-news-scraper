            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nUKRAINIAN political analyst and journalist Peter Zalmayev has suggested that Zimbabwe and neighbouring South Africa present themselves as mediators to end the war between his country and superpower Russia.\n\nZalmayev, who is on a global tour to highlight implications of the war on Ukraine and other smaller countries, was recently in Zimbabwe, having already visited South Africa, eSwatini, Lesotho and some Pacific states.\n\nNamed the Russo-Ukrainian War, the ongoing crisis began in February 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine.\n\nThe war escalated in 2022 when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its smaller neighbouring country, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths and a massive refugee crisis.\n\nSpeaking to this publication in an exclusive interview, Zalmayev said the fact that Russia and Zimbabwe shared a lot of history and that President Emmerson Mnangagwa is assured of an ear in Moscow puts the country in an important position to help end the war.\n\nRussia actively took part in the training, clothing and arming of liberation movements in Zimbabwes fight for independence.\n\nSouth Africa, according to Zalmayev, offers another angle to potential mediation by virtue of being part of the BRICS union. BRICS, an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, is an amalgamation of emerging markets.\n\nIt is these ties which make Zimbabwe and South Africa, which is in BRICS with Russia, very important interlocutors, said Zalmayev.\n\nHarare is on speaking terms with Moscow and my position is that it is best placed to reach out to Ukraine as well and suggest itself as a potential platform for negotiations to end the war.\n\nZimbabwe had been purchasing grain in Ukraine before the war broke out. Zimbabweans are also, in a way, feeling the effects of this war.\n\nIn 2022, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa led a nine-member Africa Union (AU) delegation to Moscow and Kyiv to understand and help mediate. Although they were received by both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraines Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the war continued.\n\nA study by the World Bank, United Nations (UN) and European Union (EU) earlier this year predicted that US$542 billion is needed to reconstruct Ukraine in the next ten years following Russias intensive bombardments in the past three years.\n\nAdded Zalmayev: No one wins in this war. It violates the basic UN principle of sovereignty and infallibility of borders. It is in the interest of smaller countries that Ukraine is allowed to continue existing as an independent state.\n\nIf it falls, it will create a huge precedent wherein bigger countries can walk over and take over the smaller ones.\n\nBefore the escalation of the conflict, Ukraine was one of Zimbabwe and other countries in the regions main sources of wheat and alternative grain imports.\n\n",

            "content": "Anglican Ink\n\nZimbabwes Supreme Court has upheld the enforcement of a United Kingdom divorce order involving the former Bishop of Manicaland, the Rt. Rev. Julius Makoniaffirming the authority of English court rulings over matrimonial property under Zimbabwean law.\n\nBishop Makoni, a former investment banker who became a leading figure in Zimbabwes Anglican hierarchy, resigned his post in 2015 to take a position with the International Monetary Fund. A decade later, he has found himself embroiled in a transnational legal dispute with his ex-wife, Pauline Mutsa Makoni, over matrimonial property in London and Harare.\n\nBishop Makoni, who served as the Diocesan bishop of Manicaland from 2009 to 2015, was one of the key figures in the restoration of the Anglican Diocese in the wake of the contentious Nolbert Kunonga schism. His years as bishop were marked by efforts to rebuild the spiritual and administrative health of a diocese ravaged by ecclesiastical division and state interference.\n\nBut his personal life made headlines after he and his wife divorced in the UK, where they had legal residency. The English High Court finalized their divorce in December 2014 and awarded Mrs. Makoni substantial financial compensation, including the couples marital home in Harare.\n\nWhen Mrs. Makoni sought to have the English orders recognized and enforced in Zimbabwe, Bishop Makoni objectedarguing that the UK ruling was inconsistent with Zimbabwes laws and public policy, particularly when it came to property distribution. He contended that Zimbabwean courts should not recognize foreign judgments that conferred domestic property to a foreign-domiciled spouse.\n\nBut in a landmark decision handed down last week, Zimbabwes Supreme Court dismissed Bishop Makonis objections. The bench held that foreign divorce judgmentsespecially those issued by superior courts in jurisdictions such as the UKare enforceable in Zimbabwe, provided due process was followed and the ruling does not offend local public policy.\n\nThe ruling clarified that even where Zimbabwean courts may have ruled differently in terms of asset division, they are bound by the principle of international comity and legal reciprocity to acknowledge the authority of foreign courtsparticularly where both parties were properly represented.\n\nThis decision sets a precedent in Zimbabwean jurisprudence, specifically regarding cross-border matrimonial disputes, at a time when an increasing number of Zimbabweans reside or hold assets abroad but maintain ties to their home country.\n\nThe case carries allegorical weight for the Zimbabwean church. Just as provinces throughout the Global South have historically resisted directives from England on matters of doctrine, the question posed before Zimbabwes courts was whether English authority could shape realities on Zimbabwean soil.\n\nIronically, the courts decision stands in contrast with the ecclesiastical trend: while Zimbabwean bishops and church bodies have increasingly asserted independence from Canterbury in matters of theology and liturgy, here the state court has chosen deference to English legal authority.\n\nThe case also raises difficult questions for Church leaders involved in civil litigationparticularly when it relates to personal conduct and stewardship of property. While clergy and bishops are often held to high standards within the Churchs pastoral framework, many also own assets or reside across multiple jurisdictions. More importantly, it sends a message to Church leaders, lay or ordained, that positions of ecclesiastical authority do not confer immunity in the courts of law.\n\nThe juxtaposition of Bishop Makonis spiritual authority and his civil defeat may be uncomfortable for some within the Anglican establishment. For others, it demonstrates the maturing of Zimbabwes judiciaryholding sacred and secular spheres in check while respecting the rule of law across borders.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nA landmark decision by a top UN court has cleared the way for countries to sue each other over climate change, including over historic emissions of planet-warming gases.\n\nBut the judge at the International Court of Justice in the Hague, Netherlands on Wednesday said that untangling who caused which part of climate change could be difficult.\n\nThe ruling is non-binding but legal experts say it could have wide-ranging consequences.\n\nIt will be seen as a victory for countries that are very vulnerable to climate change, who came to court after feeling frustrated about lack of global progress in tackling the problem.\n\nThe unprecedented case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) was the brainchild of a group of young law students from low-lying Pacific islands on the frontlines of climate change, who came up with the idea in 2019.\n\nOne of those students, Siosiua Veikune from Tonga, was in the Hague to hear the decision.\n\nIm lost for words. This is so exciting. Theres a ton of emotions rushing through us. This is a win we take proudly back home to our communities, he told BBC News.\n\nTonight Ill sleep easier. The ICJ has recognised what we have lived through  our suffering, our resilience and our right to our future, said Flora Vano, from the Pacific Island Vanuatu, which is considered the country most vulnerable to extreme weather globally.\n\nThis is a victory not just for us but for every frontline community fighting to be heard.\n\nThe ICJ is considered the worlds highest court and it has global jurisdiction. Lawyers have told BBC News that the opinion could be used as early as next week, including in national courts outside of the ICJ.\n\nCampaigners and climate lawyers hope the landmark decision will now pave the way for compensation from countries that have historically burned the most fossil fuels and are therefore the most responsible for global warming.\n\nMany poorer countries had backed the case out of frustration, claiming that developed nations are failing to keep existing promises to tackle the growing problem.\n\nBut developed countries, including the UK, argued that existing climate agreements, including the landmark UN Paris deal of 2015, are sufficient and no further legal obligations should be imposed.\n\nOn Wednesday the court rejected that argument.\n\nJudge Iwasawa Yuji also said that if countries do not develop the most ambitious possible plans to tackle climate change this would constitute a breach of their promises in the Paris Agreement.\n\nHe added that broader international law applies, which means that countries which are not signed up to the Paris Agreement  or want to leave, like the US  are still required to protect the environment, including the climate system.\n\nThe courts opinion is advisory, but previous ICJ decisions have been implemented by governments, including when the UK agreed to hand back the Chagos Islands to Mauritius last year.\n\nThe ruling is a watershed legal moment, said Joie Chowdhury, Senior Attorney at the Centre for International Environmental Law (CIEL).\n\nWith todays authoritative historic ruling, the International Court of Justice has broken with business-as-usual and delivered a historic affirmation: those suffering the impacts of climate devastation have a right to remedy for climate harm, including through compensation, she added.\n\nA spokesperson for the UKs Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said it was taking time to look at the opinion before commenting in detail, but added:\n\nTackling climate change is and will remain an urgent UK and global priority. Our position remains that this is best achieved through international commitment to the UNs existing climate treaties and mechanisms.\n\nThe court ruled that developing nations have a right to seek damages for the impacts of climate change such as destroyed buildings and infrastructure.\n\nIt added that where it is not possible to restore part of a country then its government may want to seek compensation.\n\nThis could be for a specific extreme weather event if it can be proved that climate change caused it, but the Judge said this would need to be determined on a case by case basis.\n\nThis is a huge win for climate vulnerable states. Its a huge win for Vanuatu, which led this case and is going to change the face of climate advocacy, said barrister Stephanie Robinson at Doughty Street Chambers, who represented the Marshall Islands.\n\nIt is not clear how much an individual country could have to pay in damages if any claim was successful.\n\nBut previous analysis published in Nature, estimated that between 2000 and 2019 there were $2.8 trillion losses from climate change  or $16 million per hour.\n\nDuring the evidence sessions in December, the court heard from dozens of Pacific Islanders who have been displaced as a result of rising sea level, caused by climate change.\n\nThe Marshall Islands highlighted that the costs for their island to adapt to climate change are $9 billion.\n\nThat is $9 billion the Marshall Islands does not have. Climate change is a problem they have not caused, but they are forced to consider relocating their capital, said Ms Robinson.\n\nAs well as compensation, the court also ruled that governments were responsible for the climate impact of companies operating in their countries.\n\nIt said specifically that subsidising the fossil fuel industry or approving new oil and gas licenses could be in breach of a countrys obligations.\n\nDeveloping countries are already exploring bringing new cases seeking compensation for historic contributions to climate change against richer, high emitting nations citing the ICJ opinion, according to lawyers the BBC spoke to.\n\nIf a country wants to bring a case back to the ICJ to make a ruling on compensation then it can only do so against countries which have agreed to its jurisdiction, which includes the likes of the UK, but not US or China.\n\nBut a case can be brought in any court globally, whether that be domestic or international, citing the ICJ opinion, explained Joie Chowdhury from CIEL.\n\nSo instead a country may choose to take their case not to the ICJ but a court where those countries are bound e.g. federal courts in the US.\n\nBut the question remains whether the ICJ opinion will be respected.\n\n[The ICJ] is an institution that is subject to geopolitics  and it relies on states adhering to its judgements, it doesnt have a police force, said Harj Narulla, a climate barrister at Doughty Street Chambers, which also represented the Solomon Islands.\n\nWhen asked about the decision, a White House spokesperson told BBC News:\n\nAs always, President Trump and the entire Administration is committed to putting America first and prioritising the interests of everyday Americans.\n\n",

It has not yet announced which countries will be affected.\n\nThe move has been criticised by International Development Committee chair Sarah Champion, who said it appears the cuts will come at the expense of some of the worlds most vulnerable people.\n\nLiberal Democrat international development spokesperson Monica Harding said slashing UK aid spending to its lowest level this century will have an appalling impact on some of the worlds poorest and most vulnerable people.\n\nThis is only the beginning  we will see far deeper and crueller cuts next year when most of the reduction happens, she warned.\n\nIt is concerning that bilateral funding for Africa, gender, education and health programmes will drop, Bond policy director Gideon Rabinowitz said.\n\nThe worlds most marginalised communities, particularly those experiencing conflict and women and girls, will pay the highest price for these political choices.\n\nAt a time when the US has gutted all gender programming, the UK should be stepping up, not stepping back.\n\nUnicef, a UN agency providing aid to children, said the cuts will have a devastating and unequal impact on children and women and called the move deeply short-sighted.\n\nPhilip Goodwin, Unicef UK chief executive, said: We urge the government to adopt a new strategic approach that places vulnerable children at the heart of its aid programmes and policies\n\nAt least 25% of aid should be directed to child-focused initiatives, ensuring that childrens health, nutrition, education, and protection are prioritised.\n\nBritish-founded charity Street Child told the BBC that some of its work to help children get access to education in Sierra Leone, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  where British aid has been a main backer  will come to an end because of the cuts.\n\nCEO Tom Dannatt said education was the greatest long-term builder of hope, and he described reducing the support as sad and short-sighted.\n\nSo children who used to go to school will not go to school, and so, more children will be found roaming the streets and ploughing fields and not developing their critical faculties, he said.\n\nWhereas they should be in school learning and having a chance to build a brighter future for themselves and for their societies, but because of these cuts by British aid for the poorest children, especially in the poorest countries, thats not the reality anymore.\n\nForeign aid has come under intense scrutiny in recent years, with the one cabinet ministeradmitting the public no longer supports spending on it.\n\nOne organisation that escaped the cuts was the World Bank. The Foreign Office confirmed that the International Development Association (IDA), the World Banks fund for the worlds lowest income countries, would receive 1.98bn in funding from the UK over the next three years, helping the organisation benefit 1.9 billion people.\n\nThe Labour governments under Sir Tony Blair and Gordon Brown committed to increasing the overseas aid budget to 0.7% of national income.\n\nThe target was reached in 2013 under David Camerons Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, before being enshrined in law in 2015.\n\nHowever, aid spending was cut to 0.5% of national income in 2021 under the Conservatives, blaming the economic pressures of Covid.\n\n",
