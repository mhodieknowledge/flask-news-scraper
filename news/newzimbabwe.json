The delisting decision follows careful consideration by the Corporate Rescue Practitioner in consultation with financial advisors and has been determined to be in the best interests of the Company and its stakeholders, says the Circular in part.\n\nThe company said the decision has been taken to facilitate the resuscitation of the company by developing and implementing a rescue plan aimed at restructuring its affairs, business, property, debt, and other liabilities.\n\nThe move is expected to stabilise the company based on the understanding that delisting is a strategic step to ensure long-term recovery, regulatory compliance and allowing the company to focus on critical restructuring tasks without public market scrutiny.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com has invited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner atMadzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal)to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans living in the diaspora. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome to Dallas, Mr. Madzima. The Zim Diaspora Property Showcase for the United States and Canada has just ended. How do you rate the attendance and buy-infrom the diaspora here in the United States?\n\nVM: As a presenter and panelist at the showcase, I was impressed and pleasantly surprised by the attendance and buy-in from the diaspora market here in the United States of America. There is a hunger for this one-on-one interface with Zimbabwean businesses, specifically in the property sector, to discuss how best the Zimbabweans living in the diaspora can invest in Zimbabwe.\n\nIt may be limiting to just say it was Zimbabweans who attended, there were a few Americans who also attended to understand the property investment processes in Zimbabwe\n\nSome attendees at the conference were from as far as Washington DC, New York and the United Kingdom, which was a bit surprising because it means that the attendees from the United Kingdom flew over 10 hours to attend the event.\n\nReporter:What were your key takeaways from the event?\n\nVM: The first thing is that the market in the United States of America is hungry to invest at home, buy properties and start a general investment portfolio in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe unsaid reality is that the Zimbabwean community living in the United States is too far from home to consistently visit Zimbabwe, as the diaspora market in England, Europe, and Africa enjoys. The distance and cost of travel are significant.\n\nThe market, therefore, heavily relies on social media feedback for investment. Negative experiences by other diasporas have a significant impact on the investment mentality of all. Correctly so, as protective instincts are at the core of human existence.\n\nThe only issue is that some of these experiences contain half-truths, do not delve into the participation by the diaspora transacting party in the negligence through a failure to employ professionals in Zimbabwe to assist with any due diligence process before transacting.\n\nThis positive is what is mainly lacking from an information uptake by the community that I personally managed to interact with. Long and short, the hunger to invest and transfer ideas to Zimbabwe is there and ripe for harvesting.\n\nReporter: What do you think were the benefits for the diaspora community in the United States of America from the property showcase?\n\nVM: The attendees benefited from real-time, practical presentations from an esteemed panel that included Lawrence Nyazema the Group Chief Executive Officer for CBZ Holdings, Tendai Muzadzi General Manager at Datvest Asset Management, Patience Patongamwoyo the Managing Director for Seeff Zimbabwe, and Broadhaven Chief Executive Officer Munyaradzi Majoni whose presentations were eye-opening, informative and invaluable, even for some co-presenters like me who travelled to the showcase from Zimbabwe\n\nReporter: I thought your presentation was equally good!\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nWhat was more key and beneficial to the attendee, in my view, was the product offering from the exhibitors. There were top developers from all over Zimbabwe, Borrowdale Valley Estate, West Prop, Velda Estates, Tapsington Estates in Marondera, Fairview Properties, CBZ Northgate Estates, and Kings City in Bulawayo.\n\nYour construction companies were also represented by Masimba Holdings and Broadhaven Construction to address the questions on construction issues. Top tier estate agencies including Seeff, Home Pros, Fine and Country and Remax.\n\nEven the public services commission was represented and offering asset management solutions.\n\nThis allowed the attendees to not only enjoy a full bouquet of services, a one-stop shop in essence, but face-to-face interactions with exhibitors representing all areas of real estate investment.\n\nOther areas of diaspora concern were also covered by various companies, including Nyaradzo and ZAMUSA.\n\nReporter: What do you think were the shortcomings of the event?\n\nVM: I honestly think that the organisers collectively underestimated the extent of the interest and geographical distances between different states in the USA. The showcase barely scratched the surface of the opportunities available for the diaspora market and Zimbabwean businesses in the real estate sector. If the showcase was to be hosted in different strategic states with varying concentrations of the Zimbabwe diaspora and Canada separately, the initiative may assist more people.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima, we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

So far, the infestation is confined to Mbare although our teams have been dispatched to assess other areas reported on social media to have bed bugs.\n\nAn Incident Manager has been appointed and an Incident Action Plan developed. The Operations Section is being led by the Environmental Health Manager Mr Manyara reads the statement.\n\nThe local authority said it is open to collaborations to fight the blood-sucking insects.\n\nSo far, CoH has reported that over 60% of targeted rooms have already been fumigated.\n\nThe bed-bug: There are no known human diseases that are caused by the bed bugs, however they can be a constant nuisance to communities. Its difficult but not impossible to control them. They have a life cycle which includes eggs which are not susceptible to chemicals used thus several fumigation rounds will be conducted to ensure there is adequate control as the eggs subsequently hatch.\n\nCurrent Control Efforts; Integrated Pest Management in Mbare flats [spraying and mass education of the affected community members and their settings]. The Harare city council started round 1 and of the planned 3 rounds of fumigation on 7 April 2025 in Mbare Flats and 64% of 5,450 rooms targeted have been fumigated.\n\nA call has been made to partners and stakeholders to get in touch with the city health department to facilitate mobilisation and collation of response resources.\n\nSustainability: Council is in the process of urgently procuring the services of private fumigation companies to quickly get on the ground and sustain operations, reads the statement\n\nThe council has provided residents with preventive measures to help control and prevent future infestations.\n\nCouncil has been disseminating key messages for bed bugs prevention and control. These tips included urging residents to maintain cleanliness, reduce clutter in rooms and expose household items that can harbour bed bugs to the sunlight regularly for whole afternoon.\n\nRegularly clean/vacuum floors, bed frames, and surrounding areas frequently, especially in cracks and crevices. Apply a recommended pesticide when there is evidence of infestation.\n\nProper laundry practices; wash and dry all bed linens, including sheets, pillowcases, blankets, and mattress protectors, in hot water (at least 50C) and dry them.\n\nRegularly change and wash bedding to prevent bed bug infestations. Avoid or treat second-hand items. Avoid second-hand clothing or fumigate them before use to prevent introducing bed bugs into your living space.\n\nCommunity engagement and cooperation; Participate in fumigation efforts organised by the CoH and are community led; collaborate fumigation teams to ensure comprehensive coverage and prevent the spread of bed bugs between units. Ensure all rooms are open for fumigation teams to access rooms.\n\n",

The remainder was commuted to 526 hours of community service.\n\nCircumstances were that between March 13 and April 15 this year, Machamacha was stationed at a Zimsend outlet at Gonye and Sons Supermarket in Chipinge. Her role as a teller involved receiving money from the company and disbursing it to local clients, who would have received international remittances.\n\nDuring that period, she was entrusted with a total of US$4,705 and ZAR600, intended strictly for disbursement to recipients. However, instead of processing payments to beneficiaries, Machamacha unlawfully converted the money to her personal use.\n\nOn April 15, 2025, the company carried out an internal audit, which revealed that the money she had been entrusted with was missing.\n\nInvestigations discovered that the offender had sent the funds to various recipients via Ecocash, in apparent personal dealings, including attempts to secure online loans an activity completely outside the scope of her responsibilities.\n\nRealising that the audit had exposed her shenanigans, Machamacha contacted an employee of Mukuru Chipinge, seeking help to cover the shortfall. She was given US$1,400 in cash, which she attempted to use to repay a portion of the stolen money. Despite this, a total of US$3,305 and ZAR600 remained unrecovered.\n\n",
