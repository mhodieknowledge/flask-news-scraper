            "content": "By Xinhua\n\nZIMBABWEAN exporters are seeking new market opportunities and business partnerships in China through participation in this years China International Import Expo (CIIE), a trade official has told Xinhua.\n\nKupakwashe Midzi, client advisor in the export development department at ZimTrade, Zimbabwes trade promotion agency, said about 15 companies from sectors including construction, horticulture, minerals, arts and crafts, and essential oils will participate in the expo, slated for Nov. 5 in Shanghai.What we are expecting to benefit from CIIE is getting more business deals, generating business leads, and getting businesses or companies in China that are interested in not only buying products from Zimbabwe, but also investing in the production of the products locally, said Midzi in a recent interview with Xinhua.He said the CIIE has, over the years, served as a key platform to showcase Zimbabwean products and expand their visibility in the vast Chinese market.We are looking forward to gaining a lot of traction from the Chinese businesses as well as potential buyers in what Zimbabwe has to offer. In the horticulture sector, the areas of interest include blueberries, chilies, avocados, and macadamia nuts, said Midzi.He noted that with Chinas zero-tariff policy for African exports, Zimbabwe aims to further tap into the Chinese market for locally produced goods.Looking at the Chinese market, we are also aiming to promote leather products, especially exotic leather. We are also looking to promote arts and crafts from Zimbabwe, the horticultural products, and the processed foods, said Midzi.Zimbabwe is additionally seeking to export heritage-based and value-added products such as baobab wine, baobab powder, and essential oils derived from indigenous resources.We have got baobab seed oil, we have got Marula oil, which are new products that are being developed in Zimbabwe, which we are looking to promote, and we believe the Chinese market is the right market, whether for further value additions into cosmeceuticals or even just consumption by the Chinese market, he said.As Zimbabwe works to strengthen its horticulture sector, businesses in blueberry production will be represented at the expo, following the signing of a blueberry export protocol during President Emmerson Mnangagwas visit to China in September.The protocol is only fairly new, but we are hoping to generate interest so that we can get information on potential buyers in China of blueberries so that we can bring back that information to the Zimbabwean growers and promote blueberry exports to China, said Midzi, adding that Zimbabwe is also pursuing export protocols for additional horticultural products, including citrus and avocados.\n\nKupakwashe Midzi, client advisor in the export development department at ZimTrade, Zimbabwes trade promotion agency, said about 15 companies from sectors including construction, horticulture, minerals, arts and crafts, and essential oils will participate in the expo, slated for Nov. 5 in Shanghai.\n\nWhat we are expecting to benefit from CIIE is getting more business deals, generating business leads, and getting businesses or companies in China that are interested in not only buying products from Zimbabwe, but also investing in the production of the products locally, said Midzi in a recent interview with Xinhua.He said the CIIE has, over the years, served as a key platform to showcase Zimbabwean products and expand their visibility in the vast Chinese market.We are looking forward to gaining a lot of traction from the Chinese businesses as well as potential buyers in what Zimbabwe has to offer.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nBUSINESS couple Clark Clever Makoni and Beverly Aisha Ndonda Makoni, accused of defrauding former Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor Gideon Gono, have approached the High Court seeking to overturn a ruling by Regional Magistrate Stanford Mambanje, which dismissed their application for discharge.\n\nIn their court papers, the couple accuses the magistrate of grossly misdirecting himself and creating new charges by placing them on their defence despite what they say is a State case barren of evidence.They cite Mambanje and Prosecutor General Loice Matanda-Moyo as first and second respondents respectively.The first respondent grossly misdirected himself by ignoring that neither the main nor the alternative charge disclosed a valid offence, the application reads.The courts reasoning was so outrageous in its defiance of logic that no sensible court applying its mind could have arrived at it.The Makonis, represented by Admire Rubaya of Rubaya and Chatambudza Legal Practitioners, argue that their prosecution is a failed fishing expedition.The State is acting like a soccer player who has dived at the centre circle of a soccer pitch and clamouring to the referee to be awarded a penalty. This is clearly unacceptable and untenable, the application states.The couple is jointly charged with fraud and corruptly using a false document after allegedly altering company directorship details of Valley Lodge (Pvt) Ltd in 2017. The State alleges they removed Ayoob Omar and Mohammed Hussein Omar as directors and replaced them with their own names to take control of the lodges accounts.But the applicants say the State failed to prove any misrepresentation, intent, or prejudice.There is no way the accused persons can be placed onto the defence in circumstances where the essential elements of the offence of fraud have not been set out, they said.As it stands, the charge of fraud is barren as it lacks the essential averments required to make it a valid one.They also accused the magistrate of overstepping his judicial role.This Honourable Court has no discretion to usurp the States responsibilities as the dominus litis and proceed to recreate new particulars and averments for the alleged charge of fraud, the couple argued.It must avoid the temptation of making a bidding for the State. It laid its bed, it must lie on it.The couple further claims the States witnesses exonerated them by confirming that Valley Lodges directorship had not changed since 2009, contradicting the fraud allegations.There was a clear concession by all the critical witnesses that the directors of Valley Lodge (Pvt) Ltd have remained the same as from 2009 till today, they submitted. This concession clearly exonerated the accused persons.They also argue the State failed to prove that they withdrew any funds from the lodges bank account, allegedly amounting to US$70,000.The State never led any evidence showing that there was any withdrawal from the account in question, the defence stated. There were no withdrawal slips nor any documentary evidence to that effect.Makoni and Ndonda further challenge the authenticity of the alleged fraudulent CR14 form, saying it was never proven to have been authored or signed by them.None of the witnesses said they saw any of the accused creating or signing the alleged CR14 in issue. The State failed to prove as a matter of fact that the accused authored the document, they said.They dismissed the case as baseless.A criminal trial is not a fishing expedition. The accused persons should not be put to their defence hoping that along the way they will convict themselves out of their own mouths. This is a classical failed fishing expedition where the State has failed to even catch a small frog or a kapenta.The couple wants the High Court to review and set aside Mambanjes ruling and substitute it with a verdict of not guilty, arguing that the magistrates decision was rendered without jurisdiction and cannot stand.The matter is yet to be heard.\n\nIn their court papers, the couple accuses the magistrate of grossly misdirecting himself and creating new charges by placing them on their defence despite what they say is a State case barren of evidence.\n\nThey cite Mambanje and Prosecutor General Loice Matanda-Moyo as first and second respondents respectively.The first respondent grossly misdirected himself by ignoring that neither the main nor the alternative charge disclosed a valid offence, the application reads.The courts reasoning was so outrageous in its defiance of logic that no sensible court applying its mind could have arrived at it.The Makonis, represented by Admire Rubaya of Rubaya and Chatambudza Legal Practitioners, argue that their prosecution is a failed fishing expedition.The State is acting like a soccer player who has dived at the centre circle of a soccer pitch and clamouring to the referee to be awarded a penalty.

This is a classical failed fishing expedition where the State has failed to even catch a small frog or a kapenta.The couple wants the High Court to review and set aside Mambanjes ruling and substitute it with a verdict of not guilty, arguing that the magistrates decision was rendered without jurisdiction and cannot stand.The matter is yet to be heard.\n\nThe State is acting like a soccer player who has dived at the centre circle of a soccer pitch and clamouring to the referee to be awarded a penalty. This is clearly unacceptable and untenable, the application states.\n\nThe couple is jointly charged with fraud and corruptly using a false document after allegedly altering company directorship details of Valley Lodge (Pvt) Ltd in 2017. The State alleges they removed Ayoob Omar and Mohammed Hussein Omar as directors and replaced them with their own names to take control of the lodges accounts.But the applicants say the State failed to prove any misrepresentation, intent, or prejudice.There is no way the accused persons can be placed onto the defence in circumstances where the essential elements of the offence of fraud have not been set out, they said.As it stands, the charge of fraud is barren as it lacks the essential averments required to make it a valid one.They also accused the magistrate of overstepping his judicial role.This Honourable Court has no discretion to usurp the States responsibilities as the dominus litis and proceed to recreate new particulars and averments for the alleged charge of fraud, the couple argued.It must avoid the temptation of making a bidding for the State. It laid its bed, it must lie on it.The couple further claims the States witnesses exonerated them by confirming that Valley Lodges directorship had not changed since 2009, contradicting the fraud allegations.There was a clear concession by all the critical witnesses that the directors of Valley Lodge (Pvt) Ltd have remained the same as from 2009 till today, they submitted. This concession clearly exonerated the accused persons.They also argue the State failed to prove that they withdrew any funds from the lodges bank account, allegedly amounting to US$70,000.The State never led any evidence showing that there was any withdrawal from the account in question, the defence stated. There were no withdrawal slips nor any documentary evidence to that effect.Makoni and Ndonda further challenge the authenticity of the alleged fraudulent CR14 form, saying it was never proven to have been authored or signed by them.None of the witnesses said they saw any of the accused creating or signing the alleged CR14 in issue.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nELITE Bryden Country School in Chegutu, Mashonaland West, has accused the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) of granting questionable authority to a Chinese-owned firm to establish a cement factory nearly 500 metres from the school.\n\nEMA is accused of issuing an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report giving the project a greenlight despite strong environmental and health concerns from stakeholders, including the school.In a letter to parents dated October 23, 2025, Brydens Board of Governors chairperson A. Noor said the High Court, presided over by Justice Mandaza, had lifted the provisional order that had stopped Shuntai Investments (Pvt) Limited from proceeding with construction until all environmental and regulatory requirements were met.The High Court discharged the provisional order issued in March that suspended Shuntai from implementing the cement plant project until all the necessary documentation was in place and compliant, Noor said.Sadly, this latest ruling means that Shuntai continues as they have been doing all along.Bryden expressed frustration with EMAs decision to grant Shuntai an EIA certificate even as the school and nearby residents continued to raise red flags over toxic emissions, noise pollution, and the projects proximity to several educational institutions.We were assured by the EMA Board that Shuntai has been issued an EIA certificate with special conditions, Noor said.We have made several requests to EMA to disclose all of these special conditions. It is worth noting that the certificate can be removed at any time for non-compliance.The school insists that the EIA process was flawed and that the current certificate contradicts the actual activities taking place on the ground.We will still appeal to the Director General of EMA as there are serious discrepancies in the ESIA report, Noor stated.What is happening on the ground is not in keeping with the report on which the certificate was granted.Bryden says the EIA dispute has become the focal point of its ongoing legal and environmental campaign against Shuntai, accusing the regulator of rubber-stamping an assessment that ignored critical health, zoning, and safety concerns.The school has also appealed to the Minister of Environment and plans to escalate the matter to the Administrative Court. Noor said these efforts are aimed at protecting pupils from what the school describes as toxic dust, noxious fumes and blasting noise coming from the construction site.Despite the High Court setback, Noor assured parents that the school remains determined to fight on.We remain optimistic and continue to trust that Bryden will be safe, he said.We are grateful for all of the support we have received through this most trying time.He urged parents to sign its petition and contribute to a GoFundMe campaign to support the legal battle.The feud between the school, EMA and Shuntai has intensified since Shuntai defied an earlier March High Court order to stop work at its Eastbourne site.The school says heavy machinery, blasting and dust emissions have continued to threaten the health and safety of its pupils.There are serious discrepancies between what was approved and what is actually happening, Noor warned.We will not relent until the safety of Bryden children is guaranteed.\n\nEMA is accused of issuing an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report giving the project a greenlight despite strong environmental and health concerns from stakeholders, including the school.\n\nIn a letter to parents dated October 23, 2025, Brydens Board of Governors chairperson A.

One more person succumbed to injuries in the hospital, bringing the death toll to 44.\n\n36 Zimbabweans died and 13 remain hospitalised in South Africa, with three in a critical condition.\n\nPreliminary investigations have revealed that the accident was due to brake failure and overloading of the bus, which was carrying 91 passengers with only a 62-seater capacity.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has since declared the bus accident a national disaster.\n\nPresenting a ministerial statement in the National Assembly recently, the Deputy Minister of Local Government and Public Works, Benjamin Kabikira, said the repatriation will be conducted in batches beginning on Friday.\n\nThe positive identification of all deceased was completed on the 20th of October, 2025, with the ZRP forensic team present to assist with the fingerprint screening and verification. In cases involving deceased children, DNA samples were collected from both the deceased and their next of kin for accurate identification.\n\nThen, on the death registration and documentation, all required documentation, including the death certificates and burial orders, are being processed to facilitate repatriation.\n\nThe repatriation to Zimbabwe is anticipated to begin in batches from Friday, 24th October 2025, pending the completion of all formal processes. A mass memorial service will be held in Beitbridge when the bodies arrive in Zimbabwe, said Kabikira.\n\nKabikira added that US$197,000 has been set aside to assist the victims.\n\nSecondly, we have dispatched a bus with next of kin or relatives from the National Disaster Management Centre, Harare, to the Beitbridge route to South Africa, for identification of the bodies. Zimbabwean nationals, that is next of kin without valid passports, were granted temporary passage into South Africa for the sole purpose of identifying the deceased.\n\nA list of names for the next of kin and national IDs was submitted to South African Immigration in advance to ensure smooth border processing. As a Ministry, post mortems were completed on Friday, the 17th of October, 2025 and the physical identification was also completed as of 20 October at Siloam Hospital.\n\nAs an intervention, the department of Civil Protection requested the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development and Zim Borders for a waiver of border charges for the hearses and bus carrying the bodies and families of the bereaved. The budget for intervention and coordination of the disaster is as follows: We are anticipating using a total amount of US$197,940 or ZWG5,340,930. 3 in the coordination and intervention of the disaster, said Kabikira.\n\n",

            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo, IOL\n\nNews that Zimbabwes ruling Zanu PF party wants to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas term of office to 2030 has drawn mixed reactions from Zimbabweans living in South Africa. Many say the move reflects the deepening political stagnation that forced them to leave home in the first place, while others argue that Mnangagwa has performed better than his predecessor, Robert Mugabe, and deserves more time to continue the countrys recovery.\n\nZanu PF announced plans to begin the process of extending Mnangagwas term of office by two years a move that, if successful, would keep him in power until 2030. The proposal was formally endorsed at the partys annual national peoples conference in the eastern city of Mutare over the weekend, where delegates instructed government structures to start drafting legislation to amend the constitution.\n\nChairperson of the Zimbabwe Community in South Africa, Ngqabutho Nicholas Mabhena, warned that the move would spell disaster for the landlocked nation.\n\nChairperson of the Zimbabwe Community in South Africa, Ngqabutho Nicholas Mabhena Image: Facebook\n\nAs the Zimbabwe Community in South Africa we condemn the action taken by Zanu PF to propose postponing elections to 2030. We want to participate in the elections in 2028. We want the parliament in Zimbabwe to give way for the diaspora vote, Mabhena told IOL.\n\nAll of us, given what is obtaining in South Africa, with Operation Dudula and other anti-migrant organisations, we believe that we can only stabilise our economy when we have resolved the political question. The political question can only be resolved through an election. If elections are postponed, we do not see any resolution of the political question, which would lead to rebuilding of the Zimbabwean economy so that we who are in South Africa can return home.\n\nOn the other hand, prominent businessman, lawyer, and socialite Moreboys Munetsi said his main concern was helping the large number of Zimbabweans in South Africa who continue to face challenges around documentation, healthcare, and employment.\n\nProminent businessman, lawyer, and socialite Moreboys Munetsi said his main concern was helping the large number of Zimbabweans in South Africa Image: Facebook\n\nPeople who are in the diaspora have been left out of economic opportunities in Zimbabwes sectors like mining and agriculture. The environment here in South Africa has become very hostile, especially to the Zimbabwe community  they really want to go back home. What makes Zimbabweans continue to stay in South Africa is that they have no idea how to survive once they get home, Munetsi told IOL.\n\nPerhaps the government of Zimbabwe could avail some funding to help its people, particularly those who are in South Africa. You can see foreigners have been blocked from accessing hospitals and certain companies. So my observation is that Zimbabweans in South Africa desire to return home, but they do not know how to survive once they are in Zimbabwe.\n\nOn behalf of the Zimbabwe Immigration Federation and the Zimbabwe Democratic Congress, Luke Mufaro Dzviti said he was deeply disappointed by Zanu PFs resolution.\n\nThe recent move by Zanu PF seeking to extend President Mnangagwas term to the year 2030 is very disappointing, unconstitutional and proof that Zanu PFmadhalas(old men) want to capture Zimbabwe more than what the Guptas and Vusimuzi Cat Matlala did in South Africa, said Dzviti.\n\nExtending Emmerson Mnangagwas tenure to 2030 is a catastrophe of monumental proportions to Zimbabwe  to Zimbabweans who are sick and tired of Zanu PFs bad governance, corruption and tyranny. This has come at a time when my party was finishing structures, a manifesto and other paperwork while fielding members of parliament in all 210 constituencies to try and make Zimbabwe great again sooner and not in the future of 2030.\n\nNot all Zimbabweans share this view. Cross-border truck driver Ishmael Gwatidzo, a Zanu PF supporter, welcomed the proposed extension.\n\nI think we have not seen an influx of Zimbabweans fleeing hardship ever since President Mnangagwa took office. We must not be quick to forget. The problem we are faced with now is how to get Zimbabweans who are in South Africa back home, but a few years back, there was pressure at the border with Zimbabweans fleeing, Gwatidzo said.\n\nWhat you get now is Zimbabweans travelling to other countries like Botswana, South Africa and Mozambique to buy goods and return home. Even our road infrastructure has improved. I think Zanu PF was right  President Mnangagwa has unfinished business.\n\nFormer Zimbabwean cabinet minister and former national political commissar of Zanu- PF, Saviour Tyson Kasukuwere spoke to IOL Image:Chipo Musarurwa Siziba/X\n\nOn Wednesday,IOL also reported that former Zanu PF heavyweight and cabinet minister Saviour Kasukuwere rubbished the partys planto extend Mnangagwas term, warning that it would end badly for both the president and the country.\n\nSpeaking to IOL, Kasukuwere said: He (Mnangagwa) is dreaming, and he has set himself up for a gigantic failure. Greediness knows no boundaries, and this will lead to a huge disaster for the country.\n\nKasukuwere, once a senior figure in the Zanu PF government led by Robert Mugabe before going into exile during the 2017 military intervention, has become one of the most prominent former insiders to publicly condemn the move to extend Mnangagwas rule.\n\n",

Before the RAF can be liable, there must be an establishment of the fact that the accident was wrongfully caused.\n\nThe bus, which was travelling from Gqeberha (Port Elizabeth) to Harare, plunged off an embankment near Makhado (Louis Trichardt) on 12 October, killing more than 40 people and leaving many passengers critically injured.\n\nThe vehicle was licensed to carry 61 passengers, but investigators from the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) found that it was carrying more than 90 people, mostly Zimbabweans and Malawians returning home.\n\nThe Zimbabwean government has since stepped in to assist its citizens  pledging to repatriate the remains of those who died, cover hospital costs for the injured, and coordinate with South African authorities. Malawian officials are conducting similar efforts to identify and assist their nationals.\n\nThe RAFs intervention comes amid public speculation that the fund is automatically liable for compensation to foreign nationals injured or killed on South African roads.\n\nHowever, the agencys statement makes clear that liability must first be established under Section 3 of the RAF Act, which stipulates that compensation can only be paid for loss or damage wrongfully caused by the driving of a motor vehicle.\n\nThat means that each claim will have to be individually investigated  including who was at fault, whether the driver or bus company was negligent, and whether the vehicle was legally roadworthy.\n\nUntil the claims are lodged with the RAF, we implore everyone concerned to allow the relevant authorities to conclude their investigations before any pronouncements are made on the liability of the RAF, the Fund told IOL.\n\nThe RAF also introduced a crucial legal caveat that could prevent some victims  particularly those without valid documentation  from receiving compensation.\n\nThe RAF as an organ of state is obliged to comply with section 42 of the Immigration Act, which prohibits the aiding and abetting of illegal foreigners, the Fund said.\n\nWhere the RAFs liability is established, the payment of compensation must not contravene any other law such as the Immigration Act.\n\nIn practice, this means that while foreign nationals are not excluded from lodging claims, undocumented migrants may face legal barriers if their compensation would be deemed to aid or abet an illegal presence in the country.\n\nLegal experts say this clause could become a flashpoint in the coming weeks, as lawyers for victims test whether the RAF can lawfully withhold payments based on immigration status.\n\nDespite its legal caution, the RAF extended condolences to those affected, saying it sympathizes with the families of those injured and deceased in the accident and pledges to support them through the claims process.\n\nThe agency urged survivors and families to make contact through its call centre (087 820 1111), WhatsApp line (071 605 4707), or emailcontactcentre@raf.co.za.\n\nThe Limpopo tragedy has reignited debate about the rights of foreign nationals in South Africa  especially when it comes to access to public compensation funds.\n\nAnti-immigrant groups have criticised the idea of South African taxpayers compensating non-citizens, while rights advocates argue that the RAFs mandate applies to all persons injured or killed on South African roads, regardless of nationality.\n\nThe outcome of the Limpopo case could set an important legal and moral precedent, testing the intersection of immigration law, human rights, and public compensation.\n\nAuthorities from the Road Traffic Management Corporation and Limpopo Transport Departmentare continuing investigations into the crash. Early findings point to excessive speed, overloading, and poor vehicle maintenance as likely contributing factors.\n\nFor now, survivors and families are being advised to gather identity documents, medical records, and accident reports to prepare their claims  a process that could take months to resolve.\n\n",

            "content": "The Conversation\n\nCannabis is booming as an ingredient in everything fromsupplementary oils, inflammation-reducingskin creams, lip balms tohealth drinksand gummy sweets that promise to reduce anxiety and pain and promote relaxation.\n\nThe global legal cannabis market is todayworth aboutUS$69.78 billion, and this will skyrocket toUS$216.76 billion by 2033.\n\nBut is this boom benefiting indigenous cannabis farmers in southern Africa? Theyd been growing the plant for hundreds of years before colonial authorities criminalised it in the early 1900s. Rural people continued to grow it illicitly after that, relying on its medicinal properties.\n\nFor many rural households in southern Africa today, cannabis pays for the familys food,education,and other necessities.\n\nIn South Africa, cannabis wasprohibitedunder different laws since1928. In neighbouring Zimbabwe, theDangerous Drugs Actcriminalised cannabis in 1955, and this continued after independence.\n\nBut in 2018, this changed. South Africas Constitutional Courtdecriminalisedprivate use and limited private cultivation for personal consumption, while Zimbabweregulatedthe cultivation of cannabis for medicinal and industrial purposes.\n\nWe are social scientists who research cannabis and development in Africa. We interviewed a wide range of people, from political leaders to illicit growers to cannabis lobbyists and non-governmental organisations to technical people involved in the industry, such as greenhouse installers. We wanted touncoverthe challenges small-scale cannabis farmers faced after cannabis was decriminalised.\n\nOur researchfoundthat cannabis reform has continued old patterns of unfairness. For example, we found that medicinal cannabis production is currently an exclusive business which only well off businesses can participate in. Farmers who traditionally cultivated cannabis and sold it when it was still illegal have not been included in the new cannabis industry.\n\nIf these problems are not solved, the potential of cannabis to be a tool for development in Zimbabwe and South Africa will remain unfulfilled.\n\nSouth Africas move towards legalisation was not triggered by the government but by the courts. The 2018 Constitutional Court rulingfound thatcriminalising private cannabis use violated the constitutional right to privacy. The state couldnt show a good enough reason to interfere with adults doing private things like smoking cannabis by consent, as long as no one else was being harmed.\n\nThis decision created a ripple effect. It ignited public debate about personal freedoms. It also sparked discussion about whether cannabis could help redress historical injustices, create jobs, and boost economies in rural areas where the plant has long been cultivated.\n\nSince then, however, reform has been slow and uneven. The government passed theCannabis for Private Purposes Act in 2024. This sets out the amounts of cannabis that individuals can possess and grow. However, most commercial trade is in the tightly regulated medical and hemp sectors (hemp beingCannabis sativawith very low levels of THC, the active psychoactive cannabanoid). Trade in cannabis outside these sectors is mainly prohibited.\n\nAlso, small-scale farmers  many of whom have cultivated cannabis for generations  face high barriers to entering the legal market. To set up a medicinal cannabis business in South Africa needs alicencefrom the health products regulatory authority. The cannabis farm has to meet high quality standards, and comply with strict manufacturing and agricultural practices. Cannabis farms are also inspected regularly.\n\nMedicinal cannabis businessesestimatethat R3 million to R5 million (US$173,000 to US$289,000) is needed to start a farm. This high cost sidelines the very communities that kept the cannabis industry going when the plant was banned.\n\nZimbabwes reform took a different route. The government legalised cannabis cultivation in 2018, but only for medicinal and industrial purposes. Recreational use remains illegal.\n\nThe governments motivation was for cannabis to complement tobacco as an important cash crop. Officials projected abillion-dollar industrygeared mainly towards exporting cannabis.\n\nIn practice, though, only wealthy investors can afford to set up cannabis export businesses. For example, a five-year medicinal cannabislicence costsUS$50,000. On top of that, cannabis farmers must paysubstantial annualinspection fees and licence renewal fees.\n\nOur research also found that the cost of greenhouses prevents small-scale farmers from starting cannabis businesses. Medicinal cannabis farmers are required to use greenhouses to control temperatures, humidity, pests and contamination. A greenhouse installer we interviewed said one of their cheaper versions cost US$220,000 for a five-hectare plot.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the main people who have benefited from cannabis law reform have been established local business people andforeign investors. Small-scale cannabis farmers  the backbone of Zimbabwes cannabis trade for decades  remain excluded. Many continue togrow it illicitly. This sustains domestic illegal markets and means these small farmers dont benefit from the promised green gold.\n\nIn both countries, corporate capture of the cannabis industry is looming. Well-capitalised companies, often with international backing, are able to afford the costs of meeting regulatory standards. They also have the funds to sell cannabis on the export market. If the cannabis industry is taken over by corporations, profits will be concentrated in a narrow elite rather than growers on the ground.\n\nBoth countries are also struggling with the contradiction between reforming cannabis laws and international drug controls which still classify cannabis as a prohibited substance. This complicates efforts to develop export markets and creates uncertainty for investors.\n\nExcluding smallholder farmers whove farmed cannabis for decades perpetuates inequality. It also undermines the sustainability of reform, because illicit markets will continue to thrive if ordinary cultivators see no benefit in moving to the legal sector. More inclusive models are possible. These could include tiered licensing systems with lower fees for small-scale farmers.\n\nCannabis producer co-operatives can also enable their participation, as is the casein Morocco.\n\nCommunities and commercial investors should partner to strengthen one another. They can form joint ventures where communities provide labour and knowledge of local climatic conditions and cannabis varieties while investors provide funds and ensure regulatory compliance.\n\nThese ventures would recognise the contribution of traditional cultivators while still ensuring cannabis quality and safety in the legal market.\n\nThe next phase of reform in both countries must focus on including small-scale farmers. Laws must be passed to balance the commercial opportunities that come from selling cannabis with the rights and livelihoods of small-scale cultivators.\n\nSenior research associate, Centre of Criminology, University of Cape Town\n\nTeaching Associate, School of Social Sciences, Cardiff University\n\nThis article was originally published inThe Conversation.\n\n",
