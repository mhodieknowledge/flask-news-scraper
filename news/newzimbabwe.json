We were given a directive that we must implement as we leave this room.\n\nIn every local authority we must, with immediate effect, deal with the issues of littering. I know we need support of Home Affairs and ZRP but with the resources that we have with the municipal police, we should be able to enforce our by-laws and make sure that people clean wherever they are operating, said Garwe.\n\nSome major cities in Zimbabwe have been struggling to manage refuse collection and maintain a semblance of cleanliness.\n\nHarare has become the epitome of this struggle, with garbage piling up in residential areas such as Mbare.\n\nDespite the involvement of a private company, Geo Pomona, in handling garbage collection in Harare, council has failed to eliminate the waste problem in the city.\n\n",

            "content": "NBC News\n\nPriscilla Presleys former business partners accused the rock widow of hastening daughter Lisa Maries death to secure her own spot atop Elvis massive financial kingdom, according to a bombshell lawsuit filed in Los Angeles this week.\n\nPlaintiffs Brigitte Kruse and Kevin Fialko accused Priscilla Presley, the former wife of Elvis Presley, of fraud, breach of contract and other civil misdeeds in a Los Angeles County Superior Court action entered on Monday.\n\nElvis Presley is the King of Rock n Roll,' the lawsuit says. Defendant Priscilla Presley always wanted to the Queen. In fact, despite flaunting a public persona that only wanted to protect and keep her family together, Priscilla ultimately wanted one thing, power, no matter the cost.\n\nPriscilla Presleys attorney Marty Singer disputed the allegations in a two-page statement Thursday.\n\nThis is without a doubt, one of the most shameful, ridiculous, salacious and meritless lawsuits I have seen in my practice, Singer said in a 648-word statement.\n\nThese fabricated claims have absolutely no validity and we are confident this case will be dismissed.\n\nKruse, an auctioneer who specialized in Elvis sales, and Fialko, an Elvis memorabilia collector, said they had been collaborating with Priscilla Presley for years to leverage her name for maximum profits.\n\nBut once Kruse and Fialko got her back on stable financial footing in November 2023, they allege, she abruptly cut ties with them and denied themcompensation from themoviePriscilla.\n\nEarlier that year, the defendants daughter, Lisa Marie, died atage 54.\n\nLisa Marie had been ailing, but Priscilla insisted they attend a Golden Globes event together on Jan. 10 as Priscilla clasped to the spotlight, the lawsuit said.\n\nLisa Marie had collapsed at herhome days earlier and diedofsmall bowel obstruction, the medical examiners office ruled.\n\nPriscilla rushed to West Hills Hospital and despite Lisas clear directive to prolong her life, Priscilla pulled the plug within hours of Lisa being admitted, according to the lawsuit.\n\nPriscilla knew that Lisas death neutralized the threat of Lisas efforts to have Priscilla removed as the sole trustee of Lisas irrevocable life insurance trust and Priscilla ultimately wanted to control the Promenade Trust and Graceland. At her house the week following (before Lisas funeral), Priscilla exclaimed, Im the queen, Im in charge of Graceland. Kruse and Fialko were heartbroken by the unsettling behavior.\n\nSinger, Priscilla Presleys lawyer, said his clients granddaughter Riley Keough stands behind her grandmother 100%.\n\nKeough is equally disgusted with this latest, vicious attempt by Kruse to attempt to ruin her grandmothers life, Singer said.\n\nA rep forKeough, Lisa Maries daughter andPriscillas granddaughter, could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.\n\nElvis and Priscilla Presleywere married for six years and divorced in 1973, four years before Elvis died.\n\nPriscilla Presley is now 80, and Elvis was 42 when he died onAug. 16, 1977, at Graceland.\n\n",
