So, he has every right, he has every right to come in and sit and follow proceedings accordingly.\n\nAnd he has done that today. There was also another reason why he was around, as he was looking at certain aspects of our parliament building. We were chosen to develop this.\n\nSo, we decided to come in and we welcomed him, said Speaker of Parliament, Jacob Mudenda.\n\nRecently, Mnangagwa made another impromptu visit to Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals, Sally Mugabe Hospital and NatPharm in Harare to assess the situation of the main referral health institutions in the country.\n\n",

            "content": "Medicalbrief\n\nSouth Africa  TheNational Department of Healthhas condemned the action taken by some groups to prevent foreign nationals from accessing essential healthcare services around the country, after campaigners in both Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal blocked clinic and hospital entry to migrant patients, demanding proof of identity before anyone was allowed in.\n\nThis week, members ofOperation Dudulain Gauteng and of theMarch and Marchmovement in KZN began manning the entrances of government facilities that includedAddington HospitalandGateway Clinicin Durban,RK Khan Hospitalin Chatsworth, andHillbrow Clinicas well asRosettenville Clinic,south of Johannesburg, in a bid to prevent alleged undocumented foreigners from seeking health services.\n\nThe Mercuryreports that they accosted patients at the gate and demanded they show ID documents to confirm they were South African nationals.\n\nIn Rosettenville last week, foreign nationals were barred from the local clinic by the protesters who said they were fed up with the long queues that mostly comprised illegal foreign nationals and who, they added, are placing a strain on the facilitys already stretched resources, reportsKaya959.\n\nThey said the clinic was on the brink of collapse, having already stretched its resources to provide free healthcare  mostly to migrants.\n\nClinic management denied allegations that it was turning people away, saying it was attending to everyone walking into the health facility, reportseNCA. Some patients in the queue said they had been waiting for assistance for a week.\n\nPut SA First\n\nDaily Maverickreports that the various anti-migrant groups broadly fall under the Put South Africa First banner  including Operation Dudula, thePatriotic Alliance(PA) and several smaller community groups.\n\nThe groups are demanding that South Africans be prioritised over undocumented migrants  whom they want deported  for economic opportunities and services, like healthcare, accusing them of burdening the countrys health system to the detriment of locals.\n\nThey demanded proof of our nationalities and denied us access because we are not South Africans. The clinic has our clinic cards because we come here for medical attention, said a young mother who was at the Rosettenville Clinic to have her baby vaccinated.\n\nThe Immigration Act stipulates that only immigration officers and members of theSouth African Police Service(SAPS) have the authority to ask citizens and foreign nationals to produce valid documentation.\n\nAt the Hillbrow Community Clinic, where members of the PA, along with a small group of residents and members of Operation Dudula, denied access to foreign nationals, an off-duty security officer toldDaily Maverickthat the (anti-foreigner) groups that have been coming here are not happy with the matron.\n\nThey feel she is siding with the foreign nationals, and when they came on Friday, some demanded to speak to the clinics provincial manager, he said.\n\nAt the Rosettenville Clinic, where community members stood guard at the gates screening patients, Aneliswa Dutshwa, who spoke on behalf of the local anti-migrant group, claimed South African voters concerns were not being taken seriously by the government.\n\nWe want Immigration and Home Affairs to be visible. We are not taking a break until they are both visible, Dutshwa said.\n\nForeign nationals who were barred from entering the facility said they were also being denied a chance to take their clinic cards so they could seek help elsewhere.\n\nSome said they could afford private healthcare, but, pointed out oneZimbabwean who was at the clinic to collect medication, private health facilities require their clinic cards, with their full medical history. Without their cards they could not go anywhere else.\n\nI would have left already because its clear that they will not allow us in, but I want my clinic card because private health facilities require those. If they can give me my card, I will leave, she said.\n\nOperation Dulula\n\nOperation Dudula, which has vowed to intensify its operations at health centres, has been calling for the deportation of all undocumented foreign nationals since its emergence in mid-2020.\n\nThe groups Zandile Dabula said they would escalate their operations and also call for doctors who are foreign nationals to be replaced with South Africans, even if the foreigners were legally employed.\n\nThe government has condemned the groups and said it would deploy police to maintain peace and enforce the law at the affected facilities.\n\nGauteng police spokesperson Brigadier Brenda Muridili said: These deployments are as and when needed, and should the need arise, the SAPS will respond to its mandate.\n\nIllegal\n\nDepartment of Health spokesperson Foster Mohale said the reports were concerning.\n\nWe have noted with concern these illegal actions, he said, adding that no one has the right to prevent anyone from medical treatment.\n\nEveryone who happens to be in the country is protected by a number number of prescripts, including Section 27 of the constitution, theNational Health Act, and theRefugees Actof 1998.\n\nWhile there were claims that those seeking health services are illegal in the country, and while the department condemns the action of those who enter the country illegally, he said, no one has the right to take the law into their own hands.\n\nGauteng Health MEC Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko indicated that her department has begun engaging concerned community-based organisations involved in the campaign, adding that while they noted the concerns by some groups, our Constitution allows everybody to access healthcare services, so it becomes difficult for us to chase people away.\n\nTheSouth African Human Rights Commission(SAHRC) said the rise in complaints from people being turned away from facilities was unlawful, discriminatory, and an infringement on human rights, reportsIOL.\n\nSection 27(1) of the Constitution clearly states that everyone has the right to have access to . services, including reproductive healthcare, it said in a statement.\n\nThe SAHRC has urged health departments and provincial leaders to address critical issues plaguing the sector, like staff shortages, long waiting times, and insufficient bed availability, saying these challenges, compounded by discriminatory practices, exacerbate healthcare inequity in an already strained system.\n\nMeanwhile, theForum for South Africa(FOSA) said the Human Rights Commission is failing in its arguments as it advocates for undocumented migrants to access healthcare services in this country.\n\nThe organisation added that illegal foreign nationals taking advantage of national health services arenot only affecting South Africans, but other legal documented foreign nationals.\n\nThey burden the system while accessing medications earmarked for citizens and documented migrants, said the organisations spokesperson, Tebogo Mashilompane.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/lithium-smuggling-rampant-as-zimbabwe-fails-to-end-corruption/",
            "content": "By Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThis story was originally published by theGlobal Press Journal.\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  In 2023, Peter, a truck driver, was approaching a border checkpoint between Zimbabwe and Mozambique. He had little reason to question what was in his trucks sealed container  hed transported shipments for this Chinese-owned company before.\n\nWe just thought everything was in order, he says.\n\nBut rather than chrome, the mineral listed on the containers paperwork, inspectors found raw lithium. By law, unprocessed lithium shouldnt leave Zimbabwe without written permission from the minister of mines and mining development. Peter didnt have that. Border officials impounded the truck and trailer  worth more than US$50,000  for a year. Drape Trucking, the company where Peter works, recovered it after paying a US$5,000 fine.\n\nZimbabwe, which boasts Africas largest lithium reserves, is poised to help meet global demand in the race to secure green energy and develop advanced technology. Its production pales in comparison to powerhouses like Australia and Chile, but the country is still among the top-eight producers of the mineral, producing 1,200 tons in 2021 alone.\n\nBut as demand grows, so does illegal trading. In Zimbabwe, some companies mislabel shipments or underreport the quality and quantity of lithium exports. Border officials  either unaware or complicit  allow the shipments to slip through, undermining efforts to regulate one of Zimbabwes most valuable exports.\n\nPeter asked that Global Press Journal use only his first name, and he did not share the name of the company responsible for the shipping containers contents. He provided the name of the owner of the company, but Global Press Journal was not able to verify the involvement of anyone by that name in the industry.\n\nTendai, a former border agent, says hes accepted bribes to allow lithium shipments to pass through the border. Tendai confirmed the incident involving Peter and says he was arrested and fined for his role. Like many other sources who spoke to Global Press Journal for this article, he asked not to use his full name for fear of losing his job.\n\nIn 2022, Zimbabwe banned the export of raw lithium to curb smuggling and extract more value, since the law would force mining companies to process lithium domestically. Since then, some of the largest lithium mining companies in the country, such as Arcadia and Bikita Minerals, have set up processing operations.\n\nData on whether these regulations have generated more revenue is hard to find. Official records show that the countrys lithium production capacity surged by 230% between 2022 and 2023. Most of the product ends up in China, which controls 90% of Zimbabwes mining sector. Even so, the ban has done little to contain lithium smuggling across Zimbabwes porous borders.\n\nThe regulations are ineffective, says Gorden Moyo, director of the Public Policy and Research Institute of Zimbabwe. Officials, including members of security services, who collude with politicians and foreign governments, particularly China, facilitate illegal exports, he says.\n\nNomsa Jane Moyo, the general manager at the Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe, a parastatal group that inspects exports, says the organization closely monitors mining at all stages to ensure that companies export the quantities and qualities they declare. They intercept those who skirt the law, she says.\n\nThe government seized 22 lithium shipments in 2023 and 23 in 2024. Some were seized before reaching the borders; others were flagged by officials at the Forbes border post, between Zimbabwe and Mozambique, and the Beitbridge border post, between Zimbabwe and South Africa.\n\nA sign marks the entrance to Prospect Lithium Zimbabwes processing plant in Goromonzi. Despite government efforts to curb smuggling, former border officials say companies conceal high-grade lithium and bribe authorities to export unprocessed minerals. Most of the countrys lithium ends up in China and Hong Kong. Credit: Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nAccording to the Minerals Marketing Corporation, in 2023, the country sold a total of 769,086 metric tons of lithium, valued at US$794 million and produced by two main lithium mining companies, Prospect Lithium Zimbabwe and Bikita Minerals. Two-thirds of these minerals went to either China (59%) or Hong Kong (7%), according to United Nations trade data.\n\nBut these figures dont reflect the true volume of lithium leaving Zimbabwe, says Tendai, the former border agent. Lithium export permits are issued with a fixed limit for how much a company can export, so companies often underreport, he says.\n\nIt all starts at the mines, where officials claim to closely monitor activities, says Tatenda, an employee at Prospect Lithium Zimbabwe who asked that Global Press Journal use only his first name for fear of losing his job.\n\nTatenda says the company undervalues high grades of lithium. And while the ministry of mines carries out inspections, he says, the high-quality lithium is concealed beneath lower-value ore to mislead inspectors.\n\nGlobal Press Journal made several attempts to speak to Prospect Lithium Zimbabwe. Officials indicated that they would comment but did not respond to subsequent requests.\n\nNomsa Jane Moyo, from the Minerals Marketing Corporation, says the lithium quality tests theyve carried out at Prospect Lithium Zimbabwe meet all legal requirements.\n\nTendai, the former border agent, says the mining companies sometimes bypass shipment records by bribing not only border officials but also officers from the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority or the Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe and others within the export chain.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Revenue Authority did not respond to multiple requests for an interview, and Nomsa Jane Moyo did not respond to allegations of corruption within the Minerals Marketing Corporation.\n\nCorruption facilitates smuggling, but some border officials dont always know what theyre inspecting, says Levious Chiukira, a customs and trade consultant at Gleam Customs and Clearing Agency.\n\nI worked as a customs official for years, yet I cannot differentiate between petalite and lepidolite, both of which are forms of lithium, he says. [The revenue authority] does not employ geologists, and there is no institutional capacity to address this knowledge gap.\n\nPiles of lithium at a mine in Mutoko. Zimbabwe banned the export of unprocessed lithium in 2022, but weak enforcement and corruption have allowed smuggling to continue. Credit: Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nExporters exploit the regulatory gaps, Gorden Moyo says. While corruption is punishable by law in China, when they operate abroad, they act with impunity.\n\nThe government hasnt helped. Contracts between the state and investors are not accessible to the public, according to a report by the Africa Policy Research Institute. It erodes public trust, says Tafara Chiremba, an environmentalist at the Zimbabwe Environmental Lawyers Association.\n\nBecause of the smuggling, Chiremba says, its China, not Zimbabwe, that benefits from the countrys wealth of lithium.\n\nLinda Mujuruis a Reporter-in-Residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.

            "content": "BBC\n\nKenyas President William Ruto has ordered police to shoot protesters targeting businesses in the legs, ensuring they are incapacitated but not killed.\n\nThe UN and human rights groups have accused the police of using excessive force in the recent wave of anti-government protests  31 people were killed on Monday, according to a state-run body.\n\nAnyone caught burning another persons business or property should be shot in the leg, hospitalised, and later taken to court. Dont kill them, but ensure their legs are broken, the president said.\n\nHe further warned his political rivals against sponsoring and using violent protests and unlawful means to forcibly remove him from power.\n\nIn addition to the 31 deaths, more than 100 people were injured and about 532 arrested in the protests which hit the capital Nairobi and other major cities, said the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR).\n\nThe Kenya police says that 11 people died.\n\nThe UN said it was deeply troubled by the killings and criticised the Kenyan police for using lethal ammunition against protesters.\n\nBut in an address on Wednesday, Ruto defended the police action, saying an attack on security forces would be a declaration of war against the country.\n\nKenya cannot and will not be ruled through threats, terror, or chaos. Not under my watch, the president said, vowing to firmly deal with those behind the protests.\n\nHe said any change of government was only possible through the ballot and not through protests, urging his opponents to wait for the 2027 general elections.\n\nThis country will not be destroyed by a few people who are impatient and who want a change of government using unconstitutional means. It is not going to happen, Ruto added.\n\nFormer Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua has denied claims that the opposition was planning to overthrow Ruto.\n\nNobody wants you out of government unconstitutionally. We want to face you on the ballot in August 2027, so just relax, said Gachagua, who was elected alongside Ruto in 2022 but was impeached last year after the pair fell out.\n\nThere has been rising tension in the country since the death of blogger Albert Ojwang in police custody last month brought people back onto the streets, a year after young protesters stormed parliament angered by a wave of tax rises.\n\nRising economic challenges have fanned anger in a country where youth unemployment and the quality of jobs remain significant concerns.\n\nRuto acknowledged the youth unemployment crisis in the country but said the job challenges had existed long before he came to power in 2022. He said that his administration was the first to take deliberate steps to address it.\n\nThe 58-year-old leader questioned why some Kenyans have been more critical and confrontational towards his administration compared to previous governments.\n\nWhy cause all the chaos during my time? Ruto asked rhetorically, warning against ethnic politics.\n\nYou can call me whatever names you want to call me, but I will make sure there is peace and stability in Kenya.\n\nMondays protests were intended to commemorate Kenyas decades-long struggle for democracy but they quickly escalated into deadly clashes in 17 out of the countrys 47 counties, local media reported.\n\nMany of those demonstrating chanted Ruto must go and wantam, meaning one term, a popular rallying call demanding President Ruto leave office.\n\nIna statement issuedon late Tuesday, the KNCHR said the sharp rise in the death toll was deeply troubling.\n\nThe KNCHR strongly condemns all human rights violations and urges accountability from all responsible parties, including police, civilians and all other stakeholders, it added.\n\nThe commission also documented widespread looting and destruction of both public and private property by unidentified individuals.\n\nAmong those killed was a 12-year-old pupil who was hit by a stray bullet while at home in Kiambu, in the outskirts of the capital, local media reported.\n\nIt is very concerning that these latest incidents come barely two weeks after more than 15 protesters were reportedly killed and many more injured in Nairobi and other parts of Kenya on 25 June, said Ravina Shamdasani, spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights.\n\nLethal ammunition, rubber bullets, tear gas, and water cannons were used, Shamdasani added.\n\nAt least two hospitals were damaged after unidentified attackers raided the facilities and stole medical equipment and harassed staff, Reuters news agency reported.\n\nReligious and rights groups have demanded a prompt and independent investigation into the killings, destruction of property and arbitrary arrests.\n\nOpposition leaders on Tuesday accused the government of deploying unmarked police vehicles to transport armed gangs to perceived opposition strongholds during the protests.\n\nThey called for a national boycott of all businesses affiliated with President Rutos administration, accusing his government of deploying state-sponsored violence and extrajudicial killings on Kenyans.\n\nThis regime is hostile. It cannot be reasoned with. It must be resisted. We will not rest. We will not retreat. We will not surrender, the opposition said in a joint statement.\n\nKenyas Chief Justice Martha Koome has cautioned the country against the increasingly violent protests, saying they risked the nations democratic fabric.\n\n",
