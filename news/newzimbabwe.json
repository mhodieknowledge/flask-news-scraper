Stability measures crime levels, civil unrest, and the threat of conflict.\n\nHealthcare assesses the quality and availability of public and private services. Culture and environment consider factors like climate, recreational options, and personal freedoms.\n\nEducation is judged by access to quality public and private schooling, while infrastructure focuses on roads, transport, housing, and global connectivity. These combined metrics provide a snapshot of how liveable a city is for its residents.\n\nMost African nations are grappling with persistent economic pressures, insecurity, and strained public services.\n\nIn many of these cities, ongoing political unrest, insecurity, limited access to quality healthcare, and under-resourced education systems contribute topoor livability scores.\n\nIn Nigeria, cities like Lagos and Port Harcourt continue to suffer from overcrowding, inadequate healthcare systems, and rising crime rates, while Zimbabwes capital, Harare, remains burdened by hyperinflation, aging infrastructure, and limited access to essential services.\n\nAlgeria and Libya have also been named among the worldsmost difficult placesto live, joining Nigeria and Zimbabwe in a ranking that highlights the pressures facing several African cities.\n\nFor example, Tripoli in Libya continues to struggle with the effects of prolonged conflict and weakened institutions, while Algiers faces structural economic challenges and restrictions on civil liberties.\n\nThese issues are compounded byinadequate infrastructureand housing conditions that fall short of global standards.\n\nThe table below presents the ten most challenging cities to live in globally.\n\nCities at the bottom of the liveability rankings are predominantly located in the Middle East and Africa, reflecting persistent instability, limited infrastructure, and constrained access to quality services.\n\n",

            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nThe controversial Broadcasting Services Amendment Act of 2025 has come into effect and is now being implemented by the Zimbabwe National Road Authority (ZINARA), with potentially crippling consequences for vehicle owners.\n\nThe crux of the problem lies in Clause 15 of the Act, which mandates that all motorists must obtain a valid ZBC radio licence before they can renew their ZINARA vehicle licence and insurance. This effectively forces drivers to pay US$30 per term to access ZBC radio services, regardless of whether they listen.\n\nFor motorists, this translates to a minimum additional cost of US$90 per term just to keep their vehicles roadworthy  a hefty sum that many fear will force them to disable their car radios or seek exemption certificates in an attempt to avoid the added expense.\n\nIn a memorandum dated 15th July 2025, ZINARAs Revenue Operations Director, Mr P.M. Shuro issued strict instructions to all licensing centre staff across the country. The directive is clear: no motorist will be permitted to renew their vehicle licence without first presenting a valid ZBC radio licence or a certificate of exemption.\n\nIn line with the enacted Broadcasting Services Amendment Act, all motorists are required to obtain a ZBC radio license before they can renew their vehicle insurance or acquire a ZINARA vehicle licence disc, the memorandum states.\n\nZINARA has, however, placed the onus on motorists to obtain exemption certificates themselves by visiting ZBC licensing offices nationwide.\n\nCustomers whose vehicles are not equipped with a radio receiver are now required to obtain an exemption certificate from the ZBC. They will need to personally visit any ZBC Licensing Office to complete the necessary declaration form and obtain this exemption. We cannot process their ZINARA disc or insurance renewal until they present a valid exemption certificate, Mr Shuros statement continues.\n\nThe Broadcasting Services Amendment Act has been a source of fierce debate since its inception. Public hearings last year generated significant opposition, and even after President Emmerson Mnangagwa signed the bill into law in March this year, the controversy has continued.\n\nMedia freedom advocates, including the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) and its partners, such as the Media Alliance of Zimbabwe (MAZ), lobbied in vain for Information Minister Jenfan Muswere to withdraw the bill before it was enacted, urging him to take public feedback into account.\n\nThe primary point of contention centres on Clause 15.\n\nCritics and analysts have argued that the Act is discriminatory, singling out motorists while allowing all citizens to access ZBC radio services through digital devices like mobile phones, without incurring this additional charge.\n\nThe new law is viewed by many as an unfair tax, further burdening already financially stretched citizens.\n\n",
