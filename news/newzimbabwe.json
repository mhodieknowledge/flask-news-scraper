So now we cannot go in because of church? We are within!\n\nThe idea of exposing pastors  trusted figures in religious communities  has sparked mixed reactions.\n\nFor those who might be unfamiliar with the show, Uyajola 9/9 is South Africas answer to the Cheaters franchise, with a distinctly local twist.\n\nIn each episode, Jub Jub and his team track down people suspected of cheating, confronting them with evidence.\n\nThe show has become known for its intense confrontations, high drama, and unpredictable outcomes, sometimes tearing families apart, other times resolving long-standing issues.\n\nNow, it seems the show is turning a critical eye toward the very institutions that are meant to guide and support moral values  churches.\n\nBy targeting pastors and religious figures, Jub Jub is challenging the belief that these spaces are beyond reproach when it comes tocheating.\n\nThe implications of exposing cheating in religious settings are complex. On one hand, its understandable why some viewers might see this as a necessary step towards transparency.\n\nIf pastors, who are often viewed as role models are coveting with thy neighbour, it raises concerns about their integrity and teachings.\n\nFor those in the congregation, the revelation could be a shock but also a wake-up call about the flaws that exist even in the most revered of spaces.\n\nHowever, theres also a more sensitive side to consider.\n\nThe church is often considered a sanctuary for people to find solace, guidance and community. By airing these personal conflicts on national TV, Uyajola 9/9 might risk eroding the trust people place in their religious leaders.\n\nSome viewers may feel that the show is exploiting sacred spaces for entertainment rather than truly serving the greater good.\n\nUyajola 9/9 is stirring up an important conversation  one about loyalty, accountability and the blurred lines between public and private life.\n\nShould religious leaders be held to a higher standard? Is it right to expose personal matters in such a public way? Or is this a wake-up call that theres no one immune to the temptations of infidelity, even in the holiest of spaces?\n\nSo many questions!\n\nJub Jub says he is also coming for cheating pastors in the next season of Uyajola99.pic.twitter.com/kyUbDcCFcr\n\n@nathit00th commented: Chief we are busy dealing with bigger issues in our country at the moment. we are repositioning south africa in the world and wena you are coming with petty issues of cheaters please dude chill. we will give you attention next year.\n\n@ModiegiLakes commented: They really need to just shut it. No longer relevant this uyajola 99 nonsense.\n\nWhile @r_motlatso wrote: Hes lying, last time he was promoting season 2 of this stupid show, he said hell be exposing celebrities who cheat. This show must be cancelled, and if you support  youre just as much as an idiot.\n\nSjoe, these people are not having it.\n\n",

The M23 does not compel anyone to return without firm security guarantees, he said.\n\nThe M23, which is made up of ethnic Tutsis, say they are fighting for minority rights, while DR Congos government says the rebels are seeking control of the eastern regions vast mineral wealth.\n\nDR Congo and the UN accused Rwandas Tutsi-dominated government of backing the M23  an allegation which Kigali has persistently denied.\n\nBut recently, the official response has shifted, with government spokespeople stating that fighting near its border is a security threat.\n\n",

We do not, in any way, want to see a Zimbabwe where the rights of the people are being eroded. In 2028, we expect to go to the polls.\n\nWe expect to have the opportunity to register our candidates and to elect a new president for Zimbabwe. That is our constitutional right, and we are urging those in ZANU PF to keep their factional disputes to themselves. Do not involve the nation, and do not disrespect our constitutional document. It is the right of citizens to choose their leaders, said Valerio.\n\nDespite Mnangagwa refusing to endorse the extension of his rule, his supporters have been rallying to push for the constitutional amendment.\n\nHe, however, has not publicly condemned the actions of this faction within ZANU PF.\n\nValerio warned that the country should not repeat the mistake of being drawn into ZANU PFs internal politics.\n\nIt is quite unfortunate that Zimbabwe keeps going down the same path. In 2017, we were presented with an opportunity for a new future. Now, we are hearing this new mantra saying we must keep the president in power because he is doing such a great job. This is why we are launching the Community Wall Initiative. We are covering the entire country because we want to put it on record: no one wants 2030.\n\nIf you speak to the people, there are hundreds gathered here today, and they will tell you clearly that they want something different every time they go to the polls. We are no longer interested in this. As UZA, we will ensure that the voice of the citizens is on record. We will not get involved in this factional fight, she said.\n\n",

We commend the governments allocation of funds in the National Budget as of 2024 to make the compensation a reality.\n\nSeveral affected investors have received initial payouts, and an emerging sense of closure exists.It marks a significant milestone and we consider it a very encouraging step towards a comprehensive and fair settlement for farmers and investors in Zimbabwe, the ambassadors said in a statement.\n\nThe President of the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the champion of the Zimbabwe Arrears clearance and Debt resolution, Dr Akinwumi Adesina hailed the milestone achievement and implored more development partners to support the initiative.\n\nThe compensation demonstrates the governments goodwill and commitment to building trust in the process and improving in the country. The progress Zimbabwe has made, the commitment and resilience it is showing, calls for support from development partners to facilitate the countrys efforts in implementing ongoing reforms and to provide the much-needed cushion to particularly the vulnerable members of the population, he said.\n\nIn 2022, the Government of Zimbabwe established a Structured Dialogue Platform with all its creditors and development partners to institutionalize engagement on economic and governance reforms to underpin the Arrears clearance and Debt Resolution Process.\n\n",

Itayi Ndudzo as Minister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution, Mashonaland East with immediate effect, read Ndudzos appointment.\n\nMnangagwa and his allies are seeking to extend his second and final term by an illegal two years against the dictates of Zimbabwes constitution.\n\nEfforts to keep him in office beyond his mandate are being continuously fought by those within the party who favour Chiwenga, a former army commander, to take over.\n\nMnangagwa and Chiwengas supporters recently clashed at the Heroes Acre in a public spat that exposed how divided Zanu PF is getting.\n\nChants in favour of both leaders taking over were heard as Mnangagwa officiated at the burial of national hero Tinaye Chigudu.\n\nDespite getting endorsements from women and youths, a section of liberation war veterans has refused to take part in what it described as the mutilation of Zimbabwes constitution.\n\n",
