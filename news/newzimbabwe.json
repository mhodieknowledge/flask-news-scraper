This development follows EJWPs submission of an urgent petition on 14 March 2025, calling for the renewal of the policy, which had lapsed in 2021  a gap that threatened to reverse hard-earned gains in gender equity, she said.\n\nThe CSO described the new policy as a foundation for a more inclusive, equitable and gender-responsive Zimbabwe, with clearly defined strategies to address systemic barriers across legal, economic, health, education, climate, and digital spheres.\n\nThe new policy, EJWP said, marks a shift from aspiration to action  offering a renewed national mandate to address entrenched gender disparities.\n\nAs EJWP, we remain deeply committed to supporting the full implementation of this policy, particularly around inclusive economic empowerment and accountability in public resource management. We will continue to monitor progress, engage with duty bearers, and amplify the voices of women, especially those in marginalised and economically excluded communities, added Mutsamvi.\n\n",

The digital fair is part of the broader Fostering Digital Villages through innovative advisory and profitable market services project, which aims to transform agrifood systems in rural Malawi, Rwanda, and Zimbabwe using effective digital technologies, including artificial intelligence.\n\nThis project facilitates delivery of innovative agricultural extension services for increased productivity, enhanced market access, and advance inclusive rural transformation. It will also support local farmers, extension officers, agro-dealers, and processors, particularly the youth and women.\n\nPatrice Talla, FAO Subregional Coordinator for Southern Africa and Representative, Zimbabwe.\n\nThe digital fair held in the Bikita district is part of a series of the ongoing campaign by FAO targeting digital service providers, rural farmers, agri-entrepreneurs and other stakeholders to interact and integrate digital technologies in agriculture. The digital fair sparked renewed enthusiasm for digital transformation in agriculture among local communities.\n\nSpeaking during the digital fair, Bernard Hadzirambwi, the District Development Coordinator, praised the initiative and encouraged farmers to adopt digital technologies to enhance productivity and resilience.\n\nRural innovation thrives when communities connect and interact with digital technology.\n\nBernard Hadzirambwi, the District Development Coordinator, Zimbabwe.\n\nDuring the digital fair, our farmers explored AI-powered advisory tools, mobile market platforms, and digital extension services.

It is an integrated development vision that enshrines digitalization at the core of rural transformation and prosperity, addressing on-farm and off-farm socio-economic elements.\n\nThe project is being implemented in the Mhondoro-Ngezi and Bikita districts where digital hubs will be equipped with digital tools and services including free internet, computers and digital literacy training materials.\n\nThe project supports local farmers, extension officers, agro-dealers, and processors through facilitating access to innovative agricultural extension services, improving market access, and promoting inclusive rural transformation.\n\nBefore the digital fair, I didnt know how much technology could change the way I farm.

Patriotism is not blind loyalty. It is not empty slogans. It is a conscious love for our country that demands honest reflection, accountability and action.\n\nTrue patriots question injustice, challenge corruption and demand systems that serve the people, not select a few. It is the voice that speaks when citizens are denied opportunities, when our youth struggle for employment, and when economic policies fail to uplift the masses.\n\nOur patriotism must ignite participation, ensuring that every Zimbabwean plays an active role in shaping the future, said Mutseyami.\n\n",
