            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo l IOL\n\nTHE National Democratic Working Group (NDWG) in Zimbabwe has denied that explosives allegedly found in opposition politician Job Wiwa Sikhalas vehicle during his arrest in Pretoria belonged to him, describing the incident as suspected foul play.\n\nIn a statement, the NDWG said Sikhala, who was arrested in Gauteng earlier this week, was subjected to what is believed to be suspected foul play when the vehicle he was travelling in was stopped and searched by members of the South African Police Service (SAPS).During the search, explosives were allegedly discovered in the vehicle. Honourable Sikhala was subsequently arrested and is currently detained at Pretoria central prison, the groups spokesperson Silenkosi Moyo said.The NDWG said its legal team was actively engaged on-site to secure the opposition leaders defence.We categorically maintain that the explosives found do not belong to him, the statement added.As the National Democratic Working Group, we stand unwaveringly beside our leader and reaffirm our commitment to defending him through all legal means available.The group appealed to the public to keep Sikhala in their thoughts and prayers during what it described as challenging times.Sikhalas arrest in South Africa comes less than a year after his release from detention in Zimbabwe, where he was arrested for allegedly inciting public violence. Rights groups and opposition figures previously accused the Harare government of persecuting him for his political activism.Sikhala remains one of the most vocal critics of Zanu PF, continuing to speak out against corruption and human rights abuses in Zimbabwe.His latest arrest has sparked fresh concern among Zimbabweans in the diaspora and raised questions about the circumstances surrounding his detention in South Africa.On the other hand, other sections of the Zimbabwean society accuse Sikhala of being involved in crime, and celebrated his arrest in Pretoria.\n\nIn a statement, the NDWG said Sikhala, who was arrested in Gauteng earlier this week, was subjected to what is believed to be suspected foul play when the vehicle he was travelling in was stopped and searched by members of the South African Police Service (SAPS).\n\nDuring the search, explosives were allegedly discovered in the vehicle.

            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nPROMINENT opposition figure Job Sikhala has described his arrest in South Africa for travelling with explosives as a set up by Zanu PF.\n\nSikhala was arrested early Friday morning when a car he was travelling in was stopped, searched and discovered to have 26 blasting cartridges and 15 capped fuse connectors; which are both forms of explosives.Images of him in handcuffs were plastered over the internet, with Zanu PF acolytes celebrating it like a win.He is being held at Pretoria Central and expected to appear in court on Monday.His South African lawyer Eric Mabuza said Sikhala was denying any knowledge of the crime while the South African Police Service (SAPS) had already made efforts to review footage at a mall the former legislator visited earlier.Sikhala was said to have been arrested after going for dinner with one of his uncles (also in police custody).It is an allegation he denies, Mabuza told state broadcaster SABC after meeting with Sikhala.He says that this is foul play because when he went out with his uncle for dinner he was not carrying any explosives but those were found as he was driving out.He said he did not come here for explosives but for medical attention.Indeed, Sikhala has been frequenting South Africa for medical help after spending over 500 days in pretrial detention before being released without charge.He was not just kept under the worst conditions but subjected to inhumane treatment over the entire period, which not only cost him his law firm but almost derailed his political career.Jacob Ngarivhume, another opposition figure in Zimbabwean politics described the explosives as having been planted in a post on X that confirmed that his family had been made aware.The pressure group he leads, the National Democratic Working Group said it suspected foul play.\n\nSikhala was arrested early Friday morning when a car he was travelling in was stopped, searched
