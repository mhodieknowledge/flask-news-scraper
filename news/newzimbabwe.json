He reportedly discussed strengthening cooperation in trade, health, agriculture, mining, investment, technologyincluding milestones like ZIMSAT1and reaffirmed commitment to deepen ZimbabweJapan relations.\n\nOnly last week, the 82-year-old Zanu PF leader met with His Holiness Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican, where they reflected on the Catholic churchs vital role in Zimbabwes schools, hospitals, and social services, and shared views on peace and justice in todays world.\n\nBefore the jetleg could subside, Mnangagwa, whose initial days in office were toned around austerity to cut on spending on foreign travel, he was off to the East this Sunday.\n\nAccording to State media, Mnangagwa is expected to join fellow invited Heads of State and Government from 26 countries, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, at Tiananmen Square for a massive military parade among other activities hosted by China for the commemorations.\n\nThe Chinese Peoples War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-1945) was the first to break out and lasted the longest in the World Anti-Fascist War.\n\nAccording to reports, in 14 years, 35 million Chinese were killed or wounded. Japan officially surrendered on September 2, 1945 by signing the Instrument of Surrender.\n\nIn 2014, Chinas national legislature designated September 3 as Victory Day of its War of Resistance.\n\nA year later, the country held its first-ever large-scale parade at Tiananmen Square to mark the occasion.\n\nState media quoted Zimbabwes Ambassador to China, Abigail Shoniwa, saying President Mnangagwa, who left the Vatican last night, is one of a few African leaders invited to the event, signalling deep ties between Harare and Beijing.\n\nThe Presidents arrival is awaited and we are very excited, he is coming at the invitation of his counterpart, President Xi Jinping and he will be one of quite a number of Heads of State that are coming.\n\nPerhaps, I can take the opportunity to add that he is one of the very few African Heads of State coming, Shoniwa told State media.\n\nWhile in China, Mnangagwa is billed to hold bilateral talks with President Xi on deepening co-operation across various sectors.\n\nThe octogenarian leader will also dialogue with company executives with business interests in Zimbabwe.\n\nChina has supported Zimbabwes various local projects, including Hwange Units 7 and 8 expansion, Kariba South Hydro Power Extension, expansion of the Robert Gabriel Mugabe and Victoria Falls International Airports.\n\nChina is Zimbabwes largest source of investment with cumulative investments exceeding US$4,4 billion, including US$400 million in the past year alone. In 2024, bilateral trade surged to US$3,8 billion with 24 percent year-on-year growth.\n\nLast month, Mnangagwa presided over the signing ceremony of a US$55 million Economic and Technical Co-operation Agreement between Zimbabwe and China in Harare.\n\n",
