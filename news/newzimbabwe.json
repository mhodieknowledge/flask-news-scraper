            "content": "By Privilege Musvanhiri, DW\n\nLawmakers from the ruling ZANU-PF party inZimbabweare moving a motion to further criminalize government critics.Theyre advocating for acomprehensive strategy to promote patriotism and national identity. Proposedmeasures includeformalizing a national ideology, establishing a national institute of ideology andintegrating patrioticeducation into the curriculum.\n\nThe motion comes on top ofthe contested Patriotic Act of 2023, which was seen toeffectively closed the door on dissent In Zimbabwe. It makes provision forcriticism issues such as provision of health care, basic services and accountability to be judged criminal.\n\nThe government dismissed criticism, saying the legislation was necessary to hold accountable individuals who threaten national interests. It said the legislation was modeled on the Logan Act in the US, which bars citizens from engaging in certain unauthorized communications with foreign governments. In Zimbabwe, violations could result in life imprisonment and death, termination of citizenship, suspension from voting or holding public office.\n\nIn a recent parliamentary debate, ZANU-PF MP Ophious Murambiwa suggested that it should be criminal to speak evilabout Zimbabwe.\n\nThe most important issue is to love our country, let us praise our country in all circumstances, whether in good or bad times, during the night or day, Murambiwa said.\n\nThe motion has prompted opposition lawmakers and human rights groups to pushback harder.\n\nPatriotism is not blind loyalty. It is not empty slogans. True patriots question injustice, challenge corruption and demand systems that serve people not a selected few, Prosper Mutseyami, an opposition MP, said.\n\nOur patriotism must ignite participation, ensuring that every Zimbabwean plays an active role in shaping the future.\n\nHuman rights activists say its another attempt to silence dissent.\n\nYou cannot necessarily legislate patriotism, Nigel Nyamutumbu, the Media Alliance of Zimbabwe programs manager, told DW. It is a concept that can naturally clamp down on the requisite freedoms. Patriotism is not a legal concept but rather a political nationalist ideology.\n\nActivists have in the past been accused of treason and unpatriotic behavior for expressing concerns over human rights abuses, corruption, and governance in Zimbabwe.\n\nCitizens have expressed concern overwhat they fear are attempts to enforce a one-party state. ZANU-PF, with its absolute majority in parliament, is seen to be abusing its authority and violating the constitution.\n\nAs parliamentarians we are supposed to uphold the constitution, Gladys Hlatshwayo an opposition MP told DW. Section 119 of the constitution demands that parliament protects the constitution and democratic governance.\n\nIn June 2025, Zimbabwes High Court struck down sections of the Patriotic Act.The court ruled that the drastic penalties prescribed by the Patriotic Act infringed on various sections of the countrys constitution.\n\nSeveral civic organizations and a private citizens had petitioned the court, arguing thatthe legislation was overly broad and vague and had high potential for abuse and misuse.\n\nThe most patriotic people are those who hold their government to account. A government must not be seen as the most dangerous institution, Eric Chisora, a political analyst, told DW. Whatever they [ZANU-PF lawmakers] are doing is unreasonable and irrational. Citizens rights must be protected.\n\nPolitical and civic rights activistsare calling for the repeal of colonial legacy laws which they say are retrogressive. Laws such as the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act, with provisions have been used to incriminate government critics, date back toZimbabwes pre-independence erawhen they were used to suppress Black majority rule.\n\nThe activists are concerned over the shrinking of democratic space under Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zimbabwes president since 2018.\n\nWe are now living in a country where there is no freedom of expression due to the number of pieces of legislation being passed by the ZANU-PF regime, Blessing Vava, executive director of the Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition, told DW.\n\nWhen you see a government passing repressive laws, just know that it is not a popular government. Zimbabweans must fight to defend the constitution.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nPeople in a gold-mining area in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo have been using their bare hands and basic tools to free miners trapped underground.\n\nSix have been pulled out alive, with one seriously injured, since shafts collapsed in Lomera in the early hours of Sunday, local journalist Ashuza Barack told the BBC.\n\nThere have been conflicting reports on the death toll. One resident said that 12 bodies had been found but Barack said no bodies had been recovered.\n\nThe area, in South Kivu province, has been under the control of M23 rebels since they captured swathes of DR Congos mineral-rich east earlier this year. The M23 rejected reports that hundreds were trapped underground.\n\nLomera has witnessed a gold rush since the end of last year when the precious ore was discovered in the hills near what was then a quiet village, according to medical charity MSF.\n\nThousands of people arrived hoping to make money as freelance, or artisanal, miners, turning the area into a sprawling chaos of mineshafts and makeshift shelters, MSF said in a statement on a cholera outbreak in the area last month.\n\nReports said a series of cascading landslides buried up to 15 of these makeshift shafts without warning.\n\nRescue efforts have slowed as debris and large stones continue to block access.\n\nJournalist Barack told the BBC that the lack of proper equipment has hampered attempts to clear the site. Survivors told him that many miners remain stuck.\n\nWeve been digging since Sunday night but have not recovered any bodies. We are exhausted, one miner said.\n\nOfficials from M23 visited the site and ordered mining activities to stop in parts of the area.\n\nDozens of mining sites across this region of DR Congo supply the global electronics industry with vital metals and minerals. Many are not properly regulated and safety standards are not observed.\n\nThe region has also been hit by conflict for decades as various rebel groups and the government have been fighting over control.\n\nThe M23 made significant territorial gains earlier this year, capturing Goma, the main city in eastern DR Congo.\n\nIt signed a ceasefire deal with the government at the weekend in talks brokered by Qatar.\n\n",
