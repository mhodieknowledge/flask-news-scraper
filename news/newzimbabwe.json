The mismanagement by the Dynamos executive led by Bernard Marriot, his relatives, and the so-called NEC has reached a boiling point, said Machovo.\n\nDynamos continue to sink deeper, currently occupying the relegation zone, separated by only two points from Kwekwe United, who sit at the basement of the table.\n\nDeMbare have managed just one win in 13 matches, scoring only two goalsa record that has sparked fury among supporters.\n\nThe struggles have been attributed to poor recruitment and the general welfare of players at the club.\n\nMachovo accused Dynamos leadership of running the club with an amateurish, and an outdated approach.\n\nWe can no longer remain silent. Our key concerns is the tuck shop mentality, outdated approach and sponsorship failure, said Machovo.\n\n",

These will be at the intersection of Simon Mazorodze and Willowvale Roads, as well as Simon Mazorodze and Remembrance Drive.\n\nMnangagwa also said four more interchanges will be built at busy road points across Harare, including Mabvuku Junction, several spots along Harare Drive, and at major traffic circles like Westgate and Kuwadzana.\n\nAdditionally, four interchanges will also be constructed at the Mabvuku Junction; Harare Drive/Mutare Road; Harare Drive/Liberation Legacy Way; Nemakonde Way/Harare Drive; Sam Nujoma/Harare Drive; Westgate Traffic Circle; Kuwadzana Traffic Circle and Churchill/Liberation Way, Mnangagwa said.\n\nHe also added that nine junctions along Harare and Bulawayo Airport Roads will also be upgraded, and smart traffic systems will be used to improve traffic flow and road discipline.\n\nNine junctions shall be updated as part of the J. M. Nkomo Road (RGM International Airport Road) upgrade to grade separation structures.\n\nIn addition, smart traffic management systems are now also in place and will be deployed towards optimising traffic flow through intelligent systems. The roll out of these systems must be publicised and see greater discipline on our roads.Although the long-delayed project is now complete, its high cost reported at US$88 million has sparked public and parliamentary debate, with calls for an audit to clarify how the funds were used, as many accuse the government of massive looting.\n\n",

Though she initially knew little about farming, her small subsistence plot now thrives.\n\nOther farms failed or were abandoned, with some new tenants unschooled in agriculture and others  including politicians who were handed land  uninterested.\n\nThere were food shortages and Zimbabwe soon required international aid.\n\nThere was a bit of a tough period through the 2000s and, unfortunately, I think it sort of refuelled racial tensions to an extent, Burger told AFP.\n\nBut being so passionate about farming was the motivator for me to move forward, he said.\n\nMupambawashe moved to the area from the southern city of Bulawayo, around 200 kilometres (125 miles) away.\n\nWhen we first came here in 2001, it was a forest and there was nothing built, she said.Some of the white farmers were angry but we managed to talk to each other in good faith and move forward.\n\nThey never let us down and said, You grabbed the farm, lets see if you can do it. But instead they brought their own tractors and equipment to come and help, which we felt was a nice gesture.\n\nIt was hard in the beginning, especially after irrigation equipment was stolen, and the early failures were embarrassing, Mupambawashe said.\n\nBut today her plot does so well that she only needs to buy in sugar and cooking oil.\n\nBurger leases land from her and lends tractors and expertise.\n\nHis familys land was among the few hundreds that were not seized in the 2000s.\n\nNonetheless, For a long time we became wound up in compensation, said Burger, vice-president of the Commercial Farmers Union of Zimbabwe (CFU) that represents mostly white farmers.\n\nBut it wasnt our purpose. Our purpose was driving agriculture and current agricultural affairs forward, he said.\n\nThis year, some farm owners whose land was confiscated received the first compensation payments after decades of waiting.\n\nThe process has been complex and divisive.\n\nThe government committed to compensation as part of an effort to settle arrears and reform the economy in order to be able to regain access to international credit lines cut two decades ago.\n\nIt announced in 2020 the creation of a fund that would pay out US$3.5 billion for infrastructure on farms but not the land, which it says was taken by force by colonial settlers.\n\nUnable to raise cash, the government in 2023 changed the offer to one percent in cash and the remainder in US dollar denominated treasury bonds.\n\nIn April, the first payments were made to 378 of 780 farmers approved for this scheme.\n\nDeon Theron, who represents the Compensation Steering Committee group of former white farmers, says the introduction of the bonds has annulled the original deal and negotiations need to start over.\n\nThe bonds are unsecured and there is limited recourse in the event of non-performance by government, he told AFP.\n\nThe general feeling amongst the farmers is firstly frustration that after 20-odd years we still have not received anything, Theron said.\n\nBut the Property and Farm Compensation Associationsaid its members would take what is on offer.\n\nThe bonds are under international guarantee, said leader Harry Orphanides, adding that digging in and seeking more from the government would be futile.\n\n",
