It undermines trust in financial institutions and affects genuine policyholders, said the NPAZ.\n\nThe NPAZ says it has come out to descend heavily on insurance fraudsters.\n\nThe justice system will continue to impose tough penalties to deter such conduct, added NPAZ\n\nThe warning by prosecutors comes following the jailing of a 40-year-old Zvishavane man, Promise Banda, who faked his daughters death in order to defraud Ecosure Insurance Company (Econet Wireless) of US$6,250 in death benefits.\n\nThe court heard that on July 29, 2025, Banda misrepresented to Ecosure Insurance Company that his daughter, Chipo Enia Banda, had passed away.\n\nProsecutors proved that the accused person forged a Child Health Card, changing details to create a fictitious dependent. He then used the forged document to acquire a burial order number 526/25 from the Zvishavane District Registrars Office.\n\nThe offender submitted the burial order and false claims online to Ecosure Insurance Company, seeking to fraudulently obtain US$6,250 in death benefits.\n\nFollowing an investigation, authorities established that the supposed beneficiary did not exist and that the offender had acted intentionally to defraud the insurance firm.\n\nThe court found Banda guilty of fraud, noting that such schemes are deliberate attacks on financial institutions and erode public trust in insurance systems.\n\nAs a result, Banda was convicted of insurance fraud and sentenced to 18 months imprisonment, of which four months were suspended on condition of good behaviour. He will, therefore, serve an effective 14 months behind bars.\n\n",

Instead of creating a limited-access account as requested by a United Nations consultant working on the project, they allegedly built a hidden account with full administrative rights.\n\nUsing this backdoor, they manipulated clearing agents prepayment accounts, inserting fictitious deposits to make it appear as if customs duties had been paid. In reality, no money was received by ZIMRA. \n\nThe agents were then able to clear goods duty-free while the accused allegedly collected cash from them, sharing the proceeds.\n\nThe scam ran undetected for months, with prosecutors telling the court that by abusing their positions, the accused acted contrary to their duties as public officers, showing favour to themselves and prejudice to ZIMRA.\n\nNothing has been recovered from the multi-million-dollar fraud.\n\nThe two were remanded in custody pending finalisation of their bail hearing.\n\n",

Integrity, discipline and unity, concern for the people and clean governance must be synonymous with Zanu PF.\n\nAs provided for in our Party Constitution, we have a duty to boldly and decisively deal with those who put the name of the Party into disrepute. Winning the hearts and minds of our people remains a critical role of every cadre and structure of the Party, Mnangagwa said.\n\nHe also warned against the abuse of empowerment facilities designed to benefit grassroots communities, citing the recently launched Presidential Womens League Empowerment Fund as an example.\n\nRecently, I launched the Presidential Womens League Empowerment Fund to facilitate the expansion and diversification of various income-generating projects being implemented by women.\n\nAbuse of these facilities will not be accepted. We are a Party that honours the grassroots. We must maintain our character as an inclusive, fair and people-centred Party, he added.\n\nDespite the government rolling out various youth and womens empowerment programmes, critics argue that most of these facilities rarely reach the intended beneficiaries, particularly young people struggling to break into the formal economy.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nParliamentarians have raised alarm over the worsening road carnage in Zimbabwe, urging government to take urgent steps to enforce road safety regulations amid revelations that nearly 2,000 people die annually from traffic accidents.\n\nDuring Wednesdays Question and Answer session, Transport Minister Felix Mhona confirmed the grim statistics, attributing many of the accidents to reckless driving, speeding, impatience, and inexperienced public transport drivers.\n\nHe told MPs that government had already procured speed trap equipment and breathalysers to clamp down on speeding and drivers operating under the influence of alcohol or drugs.\n\nWe realise that there are people who drive under the influence of drugs or intoxicating substances. We work with the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage, as well as the V.I.D., who are supposed to be on the road. Sometimes you find accidents soon after crossing those checkpoints.\n\nI would like to inform the House that the Home Affairs ministry has since procured speed trap equipment as well as breathalysers, said Mhona.\n\nHe added that stricter regulations had been introduced for public transport drivers, particularly those driving buses and haulage trucks.\n\nI know that in the past people were just driving lorries through Class 2. We have since set up a Stationary Instrument but right now, we are saying you start with Class 4 going upwards, you cannot start with Class 2.\n\nFor one to drive public transport, buses or commuter buses, you have to be above 30 years. In the past, people were driving at the ages of 21, 22 or 25, Mhona explained.\n\nZanu PF MP Vairet Nhari had questioned the licensing process for drivers who, immediately after acquiring a Class 1 or Class 2 licence, were already operating public transport vehicles with little to no experience.\n\nConcerns were also raised over unlicensed drivers and unregistered vehicles. CCC legislator Miriam Matinenga pressed the minister on governments enforcement measures.\n\nSome people are driving vehicles without licences. Also, what is government policy with regard to ensuring that all vehicles are registered because we are noticing that some drivers are driving vehicles that have no registration numbers? she asked.\n\nMhona responded that the law requires all vehicles to be registered and insured before being used on public roads.\n\nCCC Marondera Central MP Caston Matewu called for a revamp of the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe (TSCZ), which he described as toothless.\n\nWhen drivers come across the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe, which has a lot of roadblocks across the country, they often laugh because it is meaningless. What is Government policy on ensuring that we give teeth to the Traffic Safety Council of Zimbabwe so they will also be able to give penalties to drivers? Matewu said.\n\nMhona replied that Parliament has the mandate to strengthen the TSCZ through legislation, noting that processes to empower the council as an agency were already underway.\n\n",
