            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) church has reaffirmed its apolitical stance, unequivocally stating that its pulpit will only be used to advance Gods work and never a platform for political expediency.\n\nThe SDA church has lately faced a barrage of criticism following pulpit rants by former army commander, General Anselm Sanyatwe, that Zanu PF will rule forever whether you like it or not. The soldier-turned-politician, who is now Sports minister, was addressing SDA members during a philanthropy activity in Nyanga, Manicaland province, recently.In a statement to counter the narrative that the SDA tolerated Zanu PF politicians abusing its organisation, SDA Zimbabwe East Union Conference Executive Secretary, Zibusiso Trust Ndlovu reiterated the sacred nature of the institution, which must shun politics.Recent statements made during an evangelistic campaign hosted by one of our local churches have understandably caused concern.While it is consistent with our practice to invite public officials to our events as a gesture of courtesy and mutual respect (CM 126-127), any partisan political remarks made were not anticipated, were not authorised by the church leadership, and do not reflect the position of the church, said Ndlovu.According to the statement, Sanyatwe was cautioned over his unpalatable remarks, and is said to have apologised.The matter was immediately brought to the attention of the speaker, who graciously acknowledged the concern and extended an apology to church leaders on the same day, added Ndlovu.The SDA reaffirmed that the sacredness of the pulpit is non-negotiable and applies across all church organised events, and whoever intends to address congregants must bear this in mind.\n\nThe SDA church has lately faced a barrage of criticism following pulpit rants by former army commander, General Anselm Sanyatwe, that Zanu PF will rule forever whether you like it or not.

            "content": "By ESPN Cricinfo\n\nSouth Africa 418 for 9 (Pretorius 153, Bosch 100*, Brevis 51, Chivanga 4-82) vs ZimbabweHOW much luck is too much? Long before 19-year-old Lhuan-dre Pretorius became the youngest ever to score 150 in mens Test cricket, he had been given four reprieves by Zimbabwe in Bulawayo.After getting lives on 30, 54, 55 and 127, Pretorius ended up scoring 153 off 160 balls. At the time of his dismissal, he alone had scored more than half of South Africas total.By the end of the day, Corbin Boschs maiden Test hundred added to fellow debutant Dewald Brevis counter attacking 51 from 41 deliveries earlier in the day, as the visitors finished day one of the first Test on 418 for 9.Pretorius arrived when South Africa were reeling at 23 for 3 in the 15th over. At the time, Tanaka Chivanga had all three wickets, while Blessing Muzarabani and Hamilton Masakadza supported him by keeping it tight. Masakadzas figures at that stage were 5-0-9-0 and Muzarabanis were 5-4-5-0, having started with four maidens.The extra bounce on the pitch meant Muzarabani beat the bat several times early in the day, even as Chivanga struck thrice. The first breakthrough came in the sixth over when Tony de Zorzi edged to Brian Bennett at third slip for a 16-ball duck.The next wicket came when off the last ball of the 13th over, Mathew Breetzke also jabbed to Bennett at the same position. The appreciable bounce left Breetzke looking at his fingers as he walked back.The third wicket then fell in the 15th over when David Bedingham pushed hard at a length ball on the fifth stump and edged to first slip. That was when Pretorius began to hit back at Zimbabwe. Facing Masakadza in the next over, Pretorius launched him for six over long-off and then drove for four wide of mid-off. He ended the 18th over with another boundary, motoring along to 17 off his first 16 balls.Muzarabani continued to bowl tightly at the other end, but could only manage to keep the runs down. Like de Zorzi, Wiaan Mulder also struggled to find rhythm, apart from driving Masakadza for four. But Mulder was run out in the 23rd over after a mix-up with Pretorius left him well short at the non-strikers end; Muzarabanis direct throw broke the stumps cleanly.At 55 for 4, it was down to the two debutants, Pretorius and Brevis, and they repaid South Africas faith. But Pretorius was living a charmed life. In the 25th over, Chivanga could have had his fourth when Pretorius, on 30, chased a ball outside off. There was a clear noise as the ball passed the bat, prompting a loud appeal for caught behind, but the umpire remained unmoved. The absence of DRS only added to Zimbabwes frustration.Just after lunch, Pretorius reached his half-century off 53 balls, after which Brevis deposited Vincent Masekesa for six over midwicket and followed up with a straight four to end the 30th over. Chivanga, Muzarabani, and Masekesa managed to restore some control briefly.Masekesa trapped Pretorius plumb in front on 54 with a delivery that turned in and beat an attempted reverse sweep, but again, the umpire was unmoved. In the next over, on 55, Pretorius mistimed a pull off Chivanga, but the ball flew over the keepers head, his third lucky escape.Brevis, meanwhile, showcased his attacking instincts in the longest format. He smashed Masekesa for three sixes in the 36th over, bringing up his fifty in just 38 balls. However, in the next over, Muzarabani dismissed him for 51, as he toe-ended a pull to mid-off, ending a game-changing 95-run stand.Pretorius soon lost Kyle Verreynne, but continued to find boundaries regularly. He reached his century off 112 balls, hitting his third six with a beautiful punch over long-off off Bennett. Bosch, at the other end, played more calmly, focusing on rotating the strike. Their partnership crossed fifty as South Africa maintained a steady scoring rate, thanks largely to Pretorius.Pretorius final slice of luck came on 127, when he attempted a punch off Bennett and was beaten on the outside edge. Once again, there was a faint sound, but the umpire ruled in his favor. Eventually, he was dismissed after tea, in the 65th over, when Pretorius skied a pull off Chivanga to mid-on.That ended a dominant 108-run stand for the seventh wicket, but Bosch took over and frustrated Zimbabwe alongside the tail. He reached his fifty in the 71st over, flashing at a wide delivery from Muzarabani that flew over the slips for four. Keshav Maharaj supported him with a handy 21, including two sixes, in a 41-run stand, which ended when Masekesa stuck.With two wickets remaining and South Africa nearing 350, Bosch went on the offensive. From 61 off 91 balls, he accelerated to finish unbeaten on 100 off 124, hitting five boundaries in the process, including a drive, a pull, and a swat off consecutive deliveries from Masekesa. Codi Yusuf, also on debut, supported Bosch with 27, including five fours.Bosch was on 84 when Muzarabani dismissed Yusuf. At that point, South Africa had 389 runs on the board. In the company of last man Kwena Maphaka, Bosch not only reached his century in the final over of the day but also took South Africa past the 400-run mark.\n\nHOW much luck is too much?

In the company of last man Kwena Maphaka, Bosch not only reached his century in the final over of the day but also took South Africa past the 400-run mark.\n\nBy the end of the day, Corbin Boschs maiden Test hundred added to fellow debutant Dewald Brevis counter attacking 51 from 41 deliveries earlier in the day, as the visitors finished day one of the first Test on 418 for 9.\n\nPretorius arrived when South Africa were reeling at 23 for 3 in the 15th over. At the time, Tanaka Chivanga had all three wickets, while Blessing Muzarabani and Hamilton Masakadza supported him by keeping it tight. Masakadzas figures at that stage were 5-0-9-0 and Muzarabanis were 5-4-5-0, having started with four maidens.The extra bounce on the pitch meant Muzarabani beat the bat several times early in the day, even as Chivanga struck thrice. The first breakthrough came in the sixth over when Tony de Zorzi edged to Brian Bennett at third slip for a 16-ball duck.The next wicket came when off the last ball of the 13th over, Mathew Breetzke also jabbed to Bennett at the same position. The appreciable bounce left Breetzke looking at his fingers as he walked back.The third wicket then fell in the 15th over when David Bedingham pushed hard at a length ball on the fifth stump and edged to first slip. That was when Pretorius began to hit back at Zimbabwe. Facing Masakadza in the next over, Pretorius launched him for six over long-off and then drove for four wide of mid-off. He ended the 18th over with another boundary, motoring along to 17 off his first 16 balls.Muzarabani continued to bowl tightly at the other end, but could only manage to keep the runs down. Like de Zorzi, Wiaan Mulder also struggled to find rhythm, apart from driving Masakadza for four. But Mulder was run out in the 23rd over after a mix-up with Pretorius left him well short at the non-strikers end; Muzarabanis direct throw broke the stumps cleanly.At 55 for 4, it was down to the two debutants, Pretorius and Brevis, and they repaid South Africas faith. But Pretorius was living a charmed life. In the 25th over, Chivanga could have had his fourth when Pretorius, on 30, chased a ball outside off. There was a clear noise as the ball passed the bat, prompting a loud appeal for caught behind, but the umpire remained unmoved. The absence of DRS only added to Zimbabwes frustration.Just after lunch, Pretorius reached his half-century off 53 balls, after which Brevis deposited Vincent Masekesa for six over midwicket and followed up with a straight four to end the 30th over. Chivanga, Muzarabani, and Masekesa managed to restore some control briefly.Masekesa trapped Pretorius plumb in front on 54 with a delivery that turned in and beat an attempted reverse sweep, but again, the umpire was unmoved. In the next over, on 55, Pretorius mistimed a pull off Chivanga, but the ball flew over the keepers head, his third lucky escape.Brevis, meanwhile, showcased his attacking instincts in the longest format. He smashed Masekesa for three sixes in the 36th over, bringing up his fifty in just 38 balls. However, in the next over, Muzarabani dismissed him for 51, as he toe-ended a pull to mid-off, ending a game-changing 95-run stand.Pretorius soon lost Kyle Verreynne, but continued to find boundaries regularly. He reached his century off 112 balls, hitting his third six with a beautiful punch over long-off off Bennett. Bosch, at the other end, played more calmly, focusing on rotating the strike. Their partnership crossed fifty as South Africa maintained a steady scoring rate, thanks largely to Pretorius.Pretorius final slice of luck came on 127, when he attempted a punch off Bennett and was beaten on the outside edge. Once again, there was a faint sound, but the umpire ruled in his favor. Eventually, he was dismissed after tea, in the 65th over, when Pretorius skied a pull off Chivanga to mid-on.That ended a dominant 108-run stand for the seventh wicket, but Bosch took over and frustrated Zimbabwe alongside the tail. He reached his fifty in the 71st over, flashing at a wide delivery from Muzarabani that flew over the slips for four. Keshav Maharaj supported him with a handy 21, including two sixes, in a 41-run stand, which ended when Masekesa stuck.With two wickets remaining and South Africa nearing 350, Bosch went on the offensive. From 61 off 91 balls, he accelerated to finish unbeaten on 100 off 124, hitting five boundaries in the process, including a drive, a pull, and a swat off consecutive deliveries from Masekesa.

Their partnership crossed fifty as South Africa maintained a steady scoring rate, thanks largely to Pretorius.Pretorius final slice of luck came on 127, when he attempted a punch off Bennett and was beaten on the outside edge. Once again, there was a faint sound, but the umpire ruled in his favor. Eventually, he was dismissed after tea, in the 65th over, when Pretorius skied a pull off Chivanga to mid-on.That ended a dominant 108-run stand for the seventh wicket, but Bosch took over and frustrated Zimbabwe alongside the tail. He reached his fifty in the 71st over, flashing at a wide delivery from Muzarabani that flew over the slips for four. Keshav Maharaj supported him with a handy 21, including two sixes, in a 41-run stand, which ended when Masekesa stuck.With two wickets remaining and South Africa nearing 350, Bosch went on the offensive. From 61 off 91 balls, he accelerated to finish unbeaten on 100 off 124, hitting five boundaries in the process, including a drive, a pull, and a swat off consecutive deliveries from Masekesa. Codi Yusuf, also on debut, supported Bosch with 27, including five fours.Bosch was on 84 when Muzarabani dismissed Yusuf. At that point, South Africa had 389 runs on the board. In the company of last man Kwena Maphaka, Bosch not only reached his century in the final over of the day but also took South Africa past the 400-run mark.\n\nBrevis, meanwhile, showcased his attacking instincts in the longest format. He smashed Masekesa for three sixes in the 36th over, bringing up his fifty in just 38 balls. However, in the next over, Muzarabani dismissed him for 51, as he toe-ended a pull to mid-off, ending a game-changing 95-run stand.\n\nPretorius soon lost Kyle Verreynne, but continued to find boundaries regularly.

            "content": "By The South African\n\nAROUND 1,000 Afrikaner South Africans are expected to be resettled in the US, after President Donald Trump banned refugees from other countries.\n\nThe US administration, under Trump, is expected to welcome 1000 Afrikaner refugees this year as part of its resettlement programme.This comes after two groups of white South Africans were granted asylum in America over their fear of persecution and claims of racial discrimination in the country.Meanwhile, in a controversial move, Trump has indefinitely halted refugees from other countries earlier this year.US TO RESETTLE 1,000 AFRIKANER REFUGEESAccording to the Washington Post, US authorities have pledged to resettle around 1,000 Afrikaner refugees in the coming months.The group will be prioritised above any other countries that have applied for the US Refugee Admissions Programme (USRAP)The resettlement process is expected to run until the end of September.WHY NOT OTHER COUNTRIES?According to the publication, the Trump administration will also move to block 160 refugees, who were scheduled to travel to the US ahead of the February ban.Another 1,200 had been vetted and had their flights booked to arrive in the US after the ban was imposed.International Refugee Assistance Project attorney Melissa Keaney said of the administration: It simply doesnt want to process any other refugee populations other than white Afrikaners.ONLY AFRIKANERS?While US authorities claim that refugee status is open to all racial minorities in South Africa, the first two groups that have resettled abroad have been from the white population.Despite initially being targeted at Afrikaner farmers and white people, US authorities have since included coloured, Indian, and mixed-race South Africans.Applicants must prove that they are persecuted South Africans who are victims of racial discrimination.Jaco Kleynhans, of the Solidarity Movement, stated that many Afrikaners had applied for refugee status.He told the media earlier this month: Several more groups will fly to the USA over the next few weeks. The US Embassy in Pretoria, in collaboration with the State Department in Washington, DC, is currently processing 8,000 applications. And we expect many more Afrikaner refugees to travel to the USA over the next few months.They are settling in states across the USA, but particularly southern states such as Texas, North and, South Carolina, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Nebraska.He continued: Our primary focus is not refugee status for Afrikaners. But rather to find ways to ensure a free, safe, and prosperous future for Afrikaners in South Africa.

The boy was on his way to school when he was attacked at the intersection of Musasa and Mapereke roads in New Marlborough.\n\nThis incident comes just three weeks after the death of Samuel Machara, who was fatally attacked by a Pitbull in Bluffhill, only five kilometres from New Marlborough.\n\nIn an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Matthew Chifamba, a neighbour of the dogs owner, said the canines have long been a nuisance and have since destroyed the perimeter wall which separates their households.\n\nOur kitchen door faces the perimeter wall. Sometimes when we open the door, they just start barking at us, and they bulldozed our durawall.\n\nWe have tried to engage with him (dog owner) but it seems he is not bothered by our concerns.\n\nChifamba called for the dogs to be euthanised.\n\nNow things have escalated to this attack on the child, and to move forward, these dogs should be put down, he said.\n\nAucious Mubvumbi added that the community is no longer safe as there are a lot of stray and unattended dogs in the area.\n\nMarlborough is now full of stray dogs. Usually, there is a pack of six dogs which roam around in the evening, said Mubvumbi.\n\nMeanwhile, the killer Pitbull owner, Mike Mupinga, was on Tuesday denied bail by Harare Magistrate Marewanazvo Gofa.\n\n",
