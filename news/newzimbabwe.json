            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans living in the diaspora. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. This week, we want to discuss labour and employment law in Zimbabwe for foreign or diaspora businesses that want to invest in Zimbabwe. What are the main compliance requirements for companies wanting to employ workers in Zimbabwe?\n\nVM: The question is broad, but I will attempt to summarise in my response. Fundamental to all employment in Zimbabwe are the labour rights guaranteed by our Constitution, being among others, the right to be paid a reasonable and fair wage, right to fair and safe labour practices and right to join a trade union. The employment relationship must guarantee those rights.\n\nThe employer, being a foreign business, is required to register first with the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) as an employer and, if employing some foreign nationals as part of the business, to follow work permit or visa rules and establish contracts for the businesss employees.\n\nThere is also a need to comply with Statutory National Employment Council regulations governing the particular sector, National Social Security Authority (NSSA) requirements, collective bargaining agreements, trade unions and the corresponding remittances.\n\nReporter:How key are employment contracts and what specific provisions must be included in the contracts?\n\nVM: The employment contract is the crux of the employment relationship, whether written or verbal, it must comply with the law and applicable collective bargaining agreements for the sector the business operates. The contract is founded on the old contract principles of offer and acceptance, consideration and capacity to enter into contracts.\n\nAn oral contract that meets all the requirements of a contract is therefore binding on the parties as a legally enforceable employment relationship.\n\nFor diaspora or foreign companies, employment contracts must be in writing detailing whether the employment contract is permanent, fixed term or casual. The contract will be expected to observe and address, among other things, issues relating to fair wages, overtime and leave benefits, termination and dispute resolution processes.\n\nReporter: In what circumstances can an employer terminate a contract?\n\nVM: Termination of employment has to be lawful and is first governed by the employment contract. So, termination can be mutually agreed upon between the employer and employee. It can also be a result of effluxion of time being for instance, expiration of a fixed-term contract or in circumstances where an employee was employed to perform a specific task and the task has been completed.\n\nTermination may also be in terms of the employment code, in its absence, the model code and lastly as part of retrenchment in accordance with the law. What is critical is that the termination is done in terms of the law so that the employer does not suffer a claim for unfair dismissal from the employee.\n\nReporter: In the event of disputes between employer and employee, which may include a claim for unfair dismissal, what methods are provided in law to address these?\n\nVM: Disputes in the workplace are common, and the contracts of employment must prescribe the dispute resolution model. The contract must offer alternative dispute resolution models for addressing the disputes, which may include negotiation, conciliation, mediation and arbitration.\n\nOur law also prescribes forums that address certain disputes arising from the employment contracts, so it is important to know and understand such to avoid procedural irregularities.\n\nThe commonly used alternative dispute resolution model in Zimbabwe is conciliation. This method is intended to resolve disputes through labour officers, whose mandate is to settle the employer/ employee disagreement by encouraging them to explore potential options and solutions by offering new perspectives. In the event that the conciliation process fails, the labour officers will issue a certificate of no settlement, resulting in voluntary or compulsory arbitration.\n\nIt is important to remember that disputes must be referred to the labour officers timely, that is, within 2 years, otherwise the issues under dispute may be affected by prescription, denying the complainant of their right to be heard. The Labour Court is available to review the processes carried on by inferior tribunals or on appeal.\n\nReporter: What specific challenges do you think that foreign companies face when trying to comply with our labour laws?\n\nVM: Our labour laws have undergone changes and foreign companies may fail to keep updated with the amendments. Some of the foreign companies use contract templates that do not meet our legal standards. It is advisable to engage local experts at the commencement of business to ensure that the employment contracts are aligned with our laws.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima, we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

fights within the political hotbed of Mashonaland Central province.\n\nZanu PF Mashonaland Central Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) is reportedly behind the plot to obliterate Musarara.NewZimbabwe.com is in possession of a letter directed at Musarara, a Zanu PF district chairperson in the province, demanding that he avails himself for disciplinary hearing at the partys provincial headquarters in Bindura.He stands accused of leaving meetings before their conclusion and failure to supervise cell restructuring.At times and when you manage to attend provincial meetings you sit briefly and quickly sneak out without notifying anyone, even the provincial chairperson, reads letter signed by chairperson of the disciplinary committee Christopher Magomo.NewZimbabwe.com is also in possession of Musararas response wherein he demands clarity on charges and evidence of his departure.Musarara could not confirm receipt of the letter that was delivered to him on May 21 this year.Sources within the province revealed that the charges are well worked, following yet-to-be-confirmed information that President Emmerson Mnangagwa could be considering stepping down as per constitutional dictates.If Mnangagwa decides not to go ahead with plans to stay in office beyond 2028, provincial and district structures within the party will have to prepare and participate in primary elections.Home Affairs Minister Kazembe Kazembe, a well-known, perennial rival of Musarara is said to be behind the charges in an attempt to have him barred from participating in the primaries, which are said to be set for next year.Kazembe, who reportedly ordered police details to trail Musarara, did not answer his mobile phone on Sunday.Most of those within Kazembes camp where banking on the 2030 Agenda and not doing anything be it in their wards or constituencies but now that we hear the President might decide against it, the issue is now about dismissing competition by any means possible, said a source from within the Zanu PF Mashonaland Central PEC.\n\nZanu PF Mashonaland Central Provincial Executive Committee (PEC) is reportedly behind the plot to obliterate

Embrace that. You have to fail, Coventry told the swimming team at her American alma mater Auburn University last year.Ive learned the best lessons by failing, and I have failed at many things.

Its my culture. I will always represent Zimbabwe. Colour doesnt matter to me.\n\nI think every country goes through bad years and good years.Coventry had a largely urban upbringing.

All three cities are in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe three Zimbabwean nationals lured Sandip Guha of Tollygunge to invest in the trading of kola nuts and assured high returns. They created fake email addresses, WhatsApp accounts and used fake letterheads of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and a global healthcare pharmaceutical company in the UK to convince the victim for investing, a senior police officer said.\n\nKola nuts are derived from kola trees, which grow in the tropical rainforests of Africa and are popular for their high caffeine content.\n\nInvestigators said the three Zimbabweans told Guha that this was the best time to invest in kola nuts because there is a global demand in the pharma industry for these nuts. They managed to convince Guha that the bigger the investment, the higher the returns.\n\nEven the WHO is considering the health benefits of kola nuts, the three told the complainant impersonating officials of the pharma giant and the WHO, the officer said.\n\nHowever, after Guha transferred 1 crore to the bank accounts of the trio, they could not be contacted.\n\nThis is when Guha realised he had been duped. He lodged a police complaint on May 20.\n\nA case was drawn up at cyber police station under the Information Technology Act, and a probe was initiated.\n\nA team of officers began checking the details of the transactions and followed the money trail.\n\nSenior officers said the three were traced to a location in Punjab and a team from Kolkata Police left for the State.\n\nFollowing the arrest of the trio, six mobile phones, a laptop and some bank documents were seized from their possession.\n\n",
