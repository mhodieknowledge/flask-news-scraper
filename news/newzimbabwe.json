The party is disintegrated.\n\nChidawa further questioned why Mpofus name was absent from the dossier, suggesting this as evidence that Mpofu had an idea of its source.\n\nWhy is his name not being mentioned in the dossier?\n\nOn Monday, Zanu PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa stated that the politburo did not discuss the dossier at length, claiming its originator was unknown but believed to be based in South Africa.\n\nThe dossier, which Mutsvangwa said the politburo barely acknowledged, included names such as controversial business tycoons Wicknell Chivayo and Kudakwashe Tagwirei. Vice President Constantino Chiwenga reportedly questioned Mnangagwa as to why those named as corrupt had not been arrested.\n\nChidawa also claimed that Zanu PFs grassroots support in the Matebeleland Provinces erupted in celebration upon hearing news of Mpofus demotion.\n\nPeople are celebrating. There are celebrations in Matebeleland. We are talking of the downfall of a man who owns many big buildings in Bulawayo and Victoria Falls, he said.\n\nThe Zanu PF succession war is reaching a new crescendo as factions aligned to Mnangagwa and Chiwenga vie for power.\n\n",

Chiwengas ambition and growing power in the party had also forced talks of a term extension to 2030 to be shelved.\n\nAsked whether a coup was possible, Mawarire said that although he could not say it with authority, anything was possible.\n\nThere is a possibility of escalating political turmoil, of further collapse of the economy and once it collapses and there is discohesion in the ruling party, anything is possible, said Mawarire.\n\nDespite the recent silence, NewZimbabwe.com is reliably informed that provinces are being whipped into supporting Mnangagwas illegal term extension and in the process shut out Chiwenga.\n\nAdded Mawarire: What I am really sure about is that President Emmerson Mnangagwa is pushing for an unconstitutional third term and that is the source of all of the upheaval and the confusion in the cockpit.\n\nI do not think the conflict is between Mnangagwa and Chiwenga alone. The conflict is between Mnangagwa and the general polity which does not believe in the mutilation of our constitution.\n\nSection 95 of the Zimbabwean constitution sets a two-term limit on the presidency.\n\nMnangagwa is in his second five-year term, having finished off about seven months of late President Robert Mugabes term after deposing him in a coup in November 2017.\n\n",
