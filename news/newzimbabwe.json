            "content": "Botswana has declared a public health emergency, with President Duma Boko saying the national medical supply chain collapsed due to depleted government coffers and steep cuts in aid from the United States.\n\nThe announcement came on Monday after the Ministry of Health and Wellness warned earlier this month that the system was severely strained with $75m owed to private health facilities and suppliers.\n\nIt cited shortages of medicines for a range of illnesses, including hypertension, cancer, diabetes, tuberculosis, asthma, mental and sexual health, and stated that elective surgeries were postponed.\n\nThe Health Ministry also said there were shortages of dressings and sutures.\n\nThe medical supply chain, as run by central medical stores, has failed, President Boko said in a televised address on Monday. This failure has led to a severe disruption to health supplies countrywide.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance had earlier approved 250 million pula ($18.7m) in emergency funding for procurement, said Boko, adding that the military would oversee the distribution of emergency medicines, with the first shipments dispatching immediately from the capital, Gaborone, with priority given to deprived rural areas.\n\nThe current prices [for medicine] often are inflated five to 10 times. Under the current economic conditions, this scenario is not sustainable, Boko added.\n\nThe crisis is also linked to a shrinking national budget caused by the ongoing downturn in the global diamond market.\n\nBotswana, with a population of 2.5 million, is one of the worlds largest diamond producers. Its vast diamond reserves, discovered just after independence from Britain in 1966, make up about 80 percent of the countrys foreign earnings.\n\nBut sales have weakened in recent years, pushing a cash-strapped government to suspend certain ministerial purchases last month.\n\nSweeping cuts in aid from the US under President Donald Trump have further strained the economy. Before the cuts, the US funded a third of BotswanasHIV response, according to UNAIDS, and provided $12m through The Global Fund to fight malaria and tuberculosis.\n\nThe United Nations agency for children (UNICEF) said urgent action was needed to address the deepening medical crisis in the country, adding that one in five children was underweight in a western district near the Namibian border.\n\n",

Containing pumps, pipes, sprinklers, and related equipment, these productivity booster kits are meant to assist farmers in handling the challenges posed by climate change.\n\nSpeaking at thelaunch of the productivity booster kit programme in Mazowe on Monday, Mnangagwa said the equipment will be made available to tobacco smallholder farmers.\n\nMy Government plans to allocate US$1.98 billion over 10 years as a loan for the Productivity Booster Kit Programme. Additionally, five banks have committed to providing additional working capital.\n\nThe Productivity Booster Kits will also be made available to smallholder tobacco farmers, to localise the procurement of farming equipment and other aspects of the tobacco value chain, said Mnangagwa.\n\nA total of 10,000 farmers have been targeted to benefit from the first phase of the programme, with each receiving US$6,000 for the acquisition of the productivity booster kits.\n\nAccording to Mnangagwa, as a result of the kits, A1 farmers are estimated to contribute US$6.14 billion to the agricultural sector GDP from the envisaged production of 10 million tons per year.\n\nThe productivity kits are earmarked to alleviate the country from the consequences of climate change.\n\nMnangagwa further said the target is to irrigate more than 400,000 hectares of land by 2030.\n\nThe devastating effects of the El Nio-induced drought during the 2023/2024 season, among other experiences, have shown us the urgent need to climate-proof agriculture. To this end, we have set for ourselves an ambitious and achievable target to develop 496,000 hectares of land under irrigation by 2030, with over 350,000 hectares under summer cereal production, he added.\n\n",

            "content": "Telegraph UK\n\nIn early June, Britains Africa minister Lord Collins flew to Harare to meet Zimbabwes octogenarian president, Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nThe meeting in the capital city, which focused on trade between the two countries, coincided with growing fears over Zimbabwes increasingly poor human rights record.\n\nShortly after the visit, protests erupted outside a London hotel hosting a seminar for the wives of Africas top leaders, that was meant to include Mnangagwas spouse, Auxillia.\n\nOne speaker at the protest, Dickson Chikwizo, accused the Mnangagwa regime of political persecution, authoritarianism, kleptocracy and national collapse.\n\nThe contrasting image of warm handshakes in Harare and anger in London highlights the perils facing the UK Government as it tries to tap Africas bountiful mineral resources.\n\nLabour is eyeing up a pipeline of almost $1bn (740m) in deals with Zimbabwe, focused heavily on renewable energy and the critical minerals needed to power clean-energy technology.\n\nMany of the commodities are critical to Labours net zero push, and also to Britains desire to end its dependency on Chinese supplies. These materials are difficult to find in friendly places, so the UK may have to hold its noses and deal with the likes of Mnangagwa.\n\nBut are Labours net zero ambitions sacrificing Britains moral authority?\n\nAccording to a Foreign Office spokesman, Lord Collins and Mnangagwa discussed a range of issues including boosting trade and investment, and multilateral cooperation during the meeting.\n\nDid the Labour peer canvass Mnangagwa about Zimbabwes fraying democratic norms and the regimes crackdown on political opponents?\n\nNot directly. The minister  raised concerns relating to human rights with the acting foreign minister, the spokesman said.\n\nGroups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch say Zimbabwe is experiencing an increase in arbitrary arrests, detention, intimidation, and harassment of civil society and opposition figures.\n\nThey also fret at the impunity of perpetrators from the ruling Zanu-PF party.\n\nBut the British Government has had to be more pragmatic, says Knox Chitiyo, from the think tank Chatham House.\n\nThere are still concerns around human rights, around elections. But I think both sides feel that its more important to manage their differences and to consolidate the areas of agreement, which is mainly trade and commerce, to make the relationship work, he says.\n\nThis rapprochement has extended to a UK decision in late May to lift sanctions on Zimbabwes state-owned arms-maker and also four formerly high-ranking security officials who had been held responsible for the deaths of 23 protesters during the 2017 military coup.\n\nChitiyo does not see significant political blowback in Britain from the thawing relationship. He believes the UK-based Zimbabwean rights activists represent a relatively small constituency.\n\nMost Zimbabweans are here in the UK to try and work, and build a better life for their communities and their families, and they generally stay out of politics, he says.\n\nTheyre keen for a good government-to-government relationship between the UK and Zimbabwe  it has an impact on things like the availability of visas to the UK and visas to Zimbabwe.\n\nStill, there are signs of discontent in Britains Zimbabwe community.\n\nThe clutch of Zimbabwean activists who gathered outside the swanky London hotel were protesting a group of African presidential spouses, known as First Ladies of Africa for Impact and Resilience.\n\nAuxillia Mnangagwa had been due to attend, but didnt show up. Officially she had a diary clash, but the activists claimed their campaign had kept her away.\n\nThe protest underscored a growing refusal by Zimbabweans in the diaspora to remain silent, according to a post on X by an account called Zimbabwe Freedom of Expression.\n\nOvercoming democratic scruples is not Britains only challenge in unlocking Zimbabwe as an investment destination and critical materials supplier.\n\nThe Government also has to navigate the Harare regimes arbitrary setting and sticking to rules.\n\nThe investment environment in Zimbabwe is still quite high-risk in terms of regulatory challenges and policy uncertainty, given the centralisation of power in the Zanu-PF party, says Zaynab Hoosen, from the consultancy Pangea-Risk.\n\nPolicy can change quite abruptly, which then impacts private investments and commercial operations.\n\nThe UK Government itself admitted in June that in Africa, business environments are sometimes perceived as difficult to enter and relatively risky.\n\nBut the rewards might match the risk.\n\nAccording to the Atlantic Council, Africa holds one third of the worlds mineral reserves. Sub-Saharan Africa could potentially capture $2tn of the expected $16tn of global demand for the likes of copper, nickel, cobalt and lithium over the next 25 years.\n\nChina seized the moment more than a decade ago. Its mining companies have the backing of the state, which insures them against the risks. It has spent up to $10bn on critical mineral investments in Africa.\n\nIn the last few years alone, Chinese interests have taken nine or 10-figure stakes in Zambian and Botswanian copper, Malian and Zimbabwean lithium, and Congolese cobalt.\n\nWashington has only just joined the race. Under the Biden administration, the US began using government-backed export finance to take the edge off the risk for wary Western miners and financiers.\n\nDonald Trumps approach has been less clear.\n\nYouve had the tariffs, which werent helpful. Youve had aid cuts. But youve also had support continue for the Lobito Corridor [a US-backed rail-freight project], and support for Mozambique oil and gas projects, says David Omojomolo, of Capital Economics.\n\nWhere Trump has really swung into the game is with his peace-brokering efforts in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which has put the countrys $25tn of mineral reserves on the table.\n\nIn the DRC weve seen Trump really try to muscle in on the Chinese, says Henry Sanderson, of the think tank Rusi.\n\nWeve seen the US take a much more active, deal-based approach, which is what Trump likes. The big test with this new transactional approach is, are we actually going to see more money going in on the ground?\n\nIn Zimbabwe, though, the US is yet to lift its sanctions on Manangagwa and his wife. This has left the field open for the UK to take the lead in tackling the Chinese stranglehold on the countrys mining industry, particularly its rich reserves of lithium.\n\nHarare began a highly successful Look East policy under former dictator Robert Mugabe, as Western countries ostracised him over his seizure of white farms.\n\nZimbabwe is one of only 14 countries that Chinese President Xi Jinping has designated as an all-weather friend, and Chinas investment billions have flowed not just into mining but also energy, construction, agriculture and transport.\n\nStill, space may be opening up for Britain. Last month a senior Mnangagwa aide criticised Chinese investors in a public forum, warning them to desist from illicit financial activities, environmental harm and disregard for local laws.\n\nLike many African countries, Zimbabwe wants to escape from being just a mine, telling its foreign investors to process the ores in-country so the local economy captures more of the value-add.\n\nWeve seen a resurgence in resource nationalism over the last couple of years. Governments are being more active in terms of stepping into the commodities sector, and either banning exports of raw materials or demanding higher royalties, Sanderson says.\n\nThe question is, who can provide the value-add that African countries want? This could be an opportunity for the West, but the reality is that China has the expertise in processing  its far and above what the West has.\n\nHoosen says Harare is on the lookout for new partners to balance and diversify its dependence on China.\n\nZimbabwe is still in debt default, basically. So they are trying to restructure their debt, and they need bilateral partners for this, she says.\n\nMy take on it is that Zimbabwe is also trying to get bilateral lenders, like the UK perhaps, to get buy-in from them for this process.\n\nSo its mutually beneficial for both sides to rekindle ties, and to open up this partnership that has been degraded for the past few decades.\n\nLord Collins himself described the UKs courtship of Zimbabwe ties as likely to deliver a win-win situation for both.\n\nBut the path to victory leads through noisy activists and wary investors at home, and capricious autocrats and a mighty Chinese rival in Zimbabwe. Which doesnt feel like a completely certain bet.\n\n",

There was nothing to show that he was incapacitated or bedridden for all these years until June 2025. Clearly, the evidence was not convincing.\n\nMzembi, who fled the country in 2018 after being granted temporary release of his passport for medical treatment in South Africa, only resurfaced in June 2025. He argued that his cancer treatment explained his absence and that changed circumstances, including the withdrawal of charges against his co-accused, warranted his release on bail.\n\nBut the judge was unmoved, stressing that the existence of new facts does not automatically result in the applicant being granted bail.\n\nDembure found that Mzembis conduct had caused the prolonged delay in bringing the case to trial: His long absence from the jurisdiction of the court clearly caused the delay in the finalisation of his case. Having made his bed, he must lie on it.\n\nThe court also rejected arguments based on property title deeds tendered as surety. Those averments do not plead the issue of title deeds as a ground for bail on changed circumstances, ruled Dembure.\n\nIf the court was convinced that, despite the long default, he could be trusted with his liberty, it would have accepted them earlier. It did not.\n\nConcluding, the judge said there was no basis to interfere with the magistrates original decision to revoke Mzembis bail.\n\nThe appeal is completely without merit. It must fail, he ruled.\n\nMzembi will remain in custody pending trial.\n\n",

It has no mining rights to protect and no right to post security at Mukovo 12.\n\nThe court also dismissed Broadtecs attempt to block the application on the dirty hands doctrine after accusing Mutizira of trying to sneak out of mine dumps. There are no dirty hands to speak of, Justice Muzofa ruled. It is incomprehensible that 1st respondent insisted that the applicant must not be heard until it purged its contempt, yet there was nothing to purge.\n\nFinding the balance of convenience tilted in favour of the estate, Muzofa ruled that without the interdict, the applicant stands to lose his equipment to vandalism. If the 1st respondent continues to conduct mining activitiesthe applicant stands to lose the value of minerals.\n\nThe order effectively freezes all activity at Mukovo 12 until the Minister of Mines determines Mutiziras pending appeal.\n\n",
