            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE ongoing retrenchment exercise at Harares prestigious medical institution, Avenues Clinic, has reached a crescendo on the back of allegations that an estimated US$750 has been placed on offer for the least paid retrenchees.\n\nThe health group, which falls under Medical Investments Limited (MIL) recently tabled plans to lay off 50 workers as part of a strategic decision in the best interests of the company.Following the decision, documents seen by NewZimbabwe.com this week confirmed that the company offered to dole out Service Pay of one months salary for every year served, Notice Pay of three months salary in Lieu of Notice, Payment of Accrued Leave Days and Medical Aid Cover for three months up to December 31, 2025.Over and above the conditions, the company has announced a payment timeframe of six months.Considering that the least-serving employees facing the chop had served for just two and a half years while earning very small salaries, what this offer effectively means is that workers under such a bracket are set to take home just an estimated US$750 before tax.The highest paid workers who had served for about 27 years will be taking home an estimated US$8 500 and this is before tax, alleged one of the affected employees, who preferred anonymity.Another retrenched employee questioned the managements rationale arguing that there is a need to appreciate the services they extended to the organisation over the years by treating them with dignity.A Notice of Retrenchment filed by the MIL to the Retrenchment Board, which was also gleaned by our publication contains three main reasons behind the job cuts.We are embarking on the retrenchment exercise because of restructuring and remodelling of the business for prudent cash flow, management and cost containment. Positions being laid off have been outsourced to support financial and operational viability of the business as well as consolidation of the jobs for cost and headcount management, reads the notice in part.In contrast, the affected workers are pushing for a reasonable package, at least, decent enough for one to kick-start a viable project reflecting the years of committed service at a prestigious and well-oiled health facility.What is going on right now at the MIL is a deliberate ploy of sacrificing lowly paid workers. In fact whose salaries are way lesser than some of the executives airtime allowances in the name of easing financial pressures on the entity?If the company is not performing as alleged, why target small jobs and exclude top management who cream off bigger salaries and benefits? alleged one of the workers.Contacted for comment, the Avenues Clinic general manager, Sibusisiwe Ndlovu, alongside the communications officer, did not respond to phone calls and text messages despite blue ticking on Whatsapp.\n\nThe health group, which falls under Medical Investments Limited (MIL) recently tabled plans to lay off 50 workers as part of a strategic decision in the best interests of the company.\n\nFollowing the decision, documents seen by NewZimbabwe.com this week confirmed that the company offered to dole out Service Pay of one months salary for every year served, Notice Pay of three months salary in Lieu of Notice, Payment of Accrued Leave Days and Medical Aid Cover for three months up to December 31, 2025.Over and above the conditions, the company has announced a payment timeframe of six months.Considering that the least-serving employees facing the chop had served for just two and a half years while earning very small salaries, what this offer effectively means is that workers under such a bracket are set to take home just an estimated US$750 before tax.The highest paid workers who had served for about 27 years will be taking home an estimated US$8 500 and this is before tax, alleged one of the affected employees, who preferred anonymity.Another retrenched employee questioned the managements rationale arguing that there is a need to appreciate the services they extended to the organisation over the years by treating them with dignity.A Notice of Retrenchment filed by the MIL to the Retrenchment Board, which was also gleaned by our publication contains three main reasons behind the job cuts.We are embarking on the retrenchment exercise because of restructuring and remodelling of the business for prudent cash flow, management and cost containment.

For almost two decades, it sparked conversations in homes, workplaces and social media spaces, providing entertainment that felt authentically local.\n\nIt gave local actors, writers, directors, and production teams a platform to showcase their talents while telling South African stories.\n\nHelga Palmer, group head of local programming and strategy at eMedia, captured the bittersweet nature of this farewell:We are proud of what Scandal! has achieved, not only as a top-rated television property but also as a vital part of South Africas cultural landscape.\n\nWe thank the entire production team, the cast past and present, and our loyal viewers for making this journey extraordinary.\n\ne.tv has extended heartfelt gratitude to Ochre Media, the production company that brought Scandal! to life throughout its run.\n\nStan Joseph, executive producer at Ochre Moving Pictures, reflected on what the series has meant to everyone involved:Producing Scandal! has been an incredible journey and a true labour of love. For close to twenty years, our writers, directors, actors and crew have poured their hearts into bringing authentic South African stories to life.\n\nJoseph continued: We are deeply grateful to e.tv for their trust and to our audiences for their unwavering support. While it is bittersweet to say goodbye, we are proud of the legacy that Scandal! leaves behind.\n\nScandal! will continue to air until the end of June 2026, giving viewers time to process this goodbye while ensuring the series receives the send-off it deserves.\n\nFor fans, this means they have a few more months to savour every episode, every plot twist, every character moment.\n\n",
