            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nHIGH Court judge, Justice Tawanda Chitapi has reserved to Thursday, his judgement in a matter Yadah Stars founder Walter Magaya is challenging his disqualification to contest as Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) president.\n\nThe cleric-cum-sportsman took Zifa to court after he was disqualified arguing that he was illegally removed from the list.\n\nThis Friday, parties met before Chitapi, with Magayas lawyer Advocate Thabani Mpofu arguing that the decision by the ZIFA ethics committee should be reversed.\n\nThe lawyer also said the ethics committee acted in an abnormal manner which bordered on corruption.\n\nMpofu said their case was simple and carried weight.\n\nWhat brings us to court is a simple and very straightforward issue. The requirement set out in the ZIFA Constitution is clear, it says O Level or an equivalent qualification.\n\nIf a qualification issued by a university is even better than O Level, on that, this application ought to succeed, Mpofu said.\n\nMagaya submitted a diploma from the University of South Africa (UNISA).\n\nThe respondents show that they are alive to a fact that they have to give reasons for the disqualification. But what they have not done is to give reasons to say that the documents they received do not amount to a qualification.\n\nWhat the Constitution establishes is a minimum requirement. The tariff in the statute is a minimum qualification.\n\nThe Electoral Code envisages the candidates may fail to meet requirements by failing to produce certain documentsand when they fail, they dont get disqualified, Mpofu submitted.\n\nMpofu also said Magaya failed to produce an O Level certificate, and this does not mean he doesnt have that certificate.\n\nHe said the ZIFA Constitution says a candidate should be given seven days to do so.\n\nIt gives you time within which to comply. Should there be a dispute on what a candidate would have given them, it will be a time to contest that.\n\nMpofu said none of the respondents have the powers to disqualify prospective candidates.\n\nWe challenge the respondents to identify a provision that allow them to disqualify a candidate, he said.\n\nMpofu said his client had a chat with Lincoln Mutasa, ZIFA normalisation committee chairperson who told him that the issue of qualifications was not the reason they disqualified him.\n\nHe said his client will challenge Mutasa to dispute that.\n\nWhere is Mutasas rebuttal. Where is his affidavit to say this was not the reason why they disqualify him..the decision has to be reviewed and set aside, Mpofu said.\n\nProfessor Lovemore Madhuku representing ZIFA argued that Magayas application was not properly before the court.\n\nThe decisions of the respondent are not reviewable by this court. We dont know the basis on which we as ZIFA we are being brought to court, he said.\n\nMadhuku argued that ZIFA is a non-profit organisation and is not an administrative organisation.\n\nIt is nothing else, it is a private organisation and the law is very clear that you can only review disputes of administrative authorities.\n\nYou should simply strike off this application for not meeting the requirements of the court.\n\nDuring the hearing Chitapi said ZIFA was supposed to bring a record of proceedings, which culminated in Magayas disqualification.\n\nIf that record exist it should be brought before the court to ascertain who took that decision. Without the record there is nothing to talk about. The rules say that they have a duty to ensure that the record should be made available.\n\nThe issue is the law says there should be that record, the submissions should speak on the action which was taken, Chitapi said.\n\n",

            "content": "Business Report\n\nZimbabwean companies are grappling with severe economic challenges, including soaring inflation, a skewed exchange rate, and escalating operational costs, forcing some to retrench workers and others to reduce stock levels.\n\nAmong the hardest hit is Tongaat Huletts Zimbabwean subsidiary, Triangle, which announced job cuts after other cost-saving measures failed. Retailers like OK Zimbabwe are also struggling, with de-stocking becoming a growing concern as businesses navigate the countrys volatile economic landscape.\n\nAn uncertain monetary framework, characterised by run away inflation, a skewed exchange rate and pricing distortions, has left corporates in Zimbabwe battling for survival. Some of them have had to retrench while the retailers are de-stocking.\n\nZimbabwe is already battling a high unemployment rate that has driven droves of locals to seek greener pastures in South Africa and elsewhere on the region and internationally at a time the countrys economic challenges are mounting.\n\nTongaat Huletts Zimbabwean unit, Triangle, said this week that it was facing operational challenges that had forced it to retrench employees after cost cutting measures failed to yield a respite.\n\nThe current economic environment in Zimbabwe has presented unprecedented challenges for Triangle Limited over the past [three] years. After careful deliberation and extensive evaluation of our operational and economic realities, we have made the extremely difficult decision to implement a phased retrenchment process, Tendai Masawi, the managing director of Triangle, said in a note to employees this week.\n\nHe cited escalating operational costs particularly in areas such as fertiliser, fuel, maintenance costs and imported goods/services, combined with inflationary pressures, currency losses, the inability to claim VAT on inputs after sugar was exempted from VAT, and competition from low cost duty-free imported sugar as having severely impacted the companys ability to sustain continued production.\n\nTriangle, which housed Tongaat Huletts Zimbabwean interests that also include Hippo Valley, said it had seen profit margins decline significantly by 55%with manpower costs is spiking by 133% as a proportion of revenue, and debt levels rising to unsustainable levels.\n\nTriangle had thus been unable to generate positive cash flows from its operating activities over the past three years as it had faced a very constrained working capital position.\n\nThese financial realities underscore the urgent need for corrective action so that the business can generate sufficient cash flows to reduce debt and reinvest in its future. This (retrenchment) decision has been taken to protect the long-term sustainability of our organisation and ensure that Triangle Limited continues to play its vital role in Zimbabwes economy, the company said.\n\nTongaat Hulett Limited, is currently preparing to dispose of the Zimbabwe operations to the owners of the Vision Group for about R5.9 billion. The Zimbabwe operations for Tongaat Hulett were among a few stable divisions under the crisis ridden and troubled South African sugar and agro-processing unit that also had operations in Mozambique.\n\nRetailers are equally affected, with OK Zimbabwe and other operators like Choppies reducing stock levels due to policies that mandate local currency transactions despite widespread use of foreign currencies.\n\nDe-stocking levels across most of OK Zimbabwes outlets have raised the alarm and concerns that the company is buckling under Zimbabwes policies that force retailers to trade in local currency against widespread use of foreign currencies in a country battling for currency stability.\n\nIn a statement, OK Zimbabwe acknowledged that it had faced stocking levels over the past few weeks. The company faced intermittent product supply challenges during the festive period. The Company, as well as most of the formal retail sector, has been adversely impacted by a volatile operating environment, said OK Zimbabwe.\n\nMeanwhile, manufacturers like Mega Mart have appealed to government officials for structural reforms to expand the formal sector, which they argue would boost tax revenues and support economic recovery.\n\n",

I do not keep records there, I move with my office, he said.\n\nIn 2020, Matengarufu was chased away from a workshop by fellow council officials.\n\nHe also claimed that his home was raided by robbers and his security guard sustained some injuries.\n\nThe situation at the Town House is so chaotic that even suspended officials show up for work in violationof laws governing workers serving suspensions.\n\nHe said bringing normalcy to HCC is impossible as the overtures are thwarted by senior officials with Town Clerk, Hosiah Chisango being fingered.\n\nAdded Matengarufu, You can describe it like that (chaotic) but myself I say it is a toxicenvironment. When you want to do the right thing you are penalised for doing the right thing or you are just ignored like I have written to the Town Clerk. I was like a lone figure in the chaos you are trying to describe.\n\n",
