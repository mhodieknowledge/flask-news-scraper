It is politics delaying the opening of these borders, which in our opinion is inevitable.Government has the tendency to inflate growth estimates and the market warned several months ago that they were significantly overestimating the maize crop.Current supply is extremely tight and millers are already dipping into reserves.

Nehanda was to be the first to testify. However such does not debar a witness from testifying, he said.\n\nThe ruling is the latest twist in AFMs protracted legal wars, which have seen congregants, pastors, and church leaders locked in disputes over who controls the churchs lucrative assets.\n\n",
