            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nAN empty drink can has become a makeshift surgical tool in the poverty-stricken community of Epworth where a traditional birth attendant, Tapiwa Vhinya, uses it to cut umbilical cords during home deliveries.\n\nWith no access to surgical blades, cord clamps, sterile strings or tapes, she improvises with whatever is at hand, tying cords with ordinary draw threads. It is a dangerous practice, yet one many women turn to because hospital births are beyond their reach.\n\nLocals call Vhinya (34) Ambuya Va52, a nickname she has earned from the 52 babies shehas deliveredin Epworth, a high-density suburb about 12 kilometres southeast of Zimbabwes capital, Harare, since she started in 2019.\n\nIn an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, the traditional birth attendant said she has delivered most of these children with her bare hands, as neither she nor the expectant mother have access to surgical gloves.\n\nWe live in a poor community where most people are unemployed and can barely afford to put food on the table, so most of these women are turned back home from the local (Epworth clinic) as they cannot afford it.\n\nI have delivered most of these babies, touching blood with my bare hands as I do not have access to gloves.\n\nI use empty drink cans to cut the umbilical cord and draw threads to tie the babys cord after cutting it and that is the biggest challenge I have been facing since I started, Vhinya said.\n\nVhinya does not have a proper delivery room for the home births she attends. Most of them take place outside, exposed to the elements. Despite the risks and the effort involved, she does not charge the mothers she helps. Instead, she receives small tokens of appreciation often just a bottle of milk and a bar of soap. According to tradition, the milk is used to wash her eyes, as it is believed failure to do so could eventually cause blindness, while the soap is meant for cleaning her clothes after the deliveries.\n\nEpworths traditional birth attendant Tapiwa Vhinya\n\nAt the local clinic, women are required to bring their own delivery supplies: ten pairs of gloves, surgical blades, cord clamps, linen savers, cotton, methylated spirit, and other essentials.\n\nIn addition, before admission, expectant mothers must pay a registration fee of US$45 for a normal delivery, along with an extra US$40 to cover the cost of an ambulance should complications require transfer to a larger hospital.Without the supplies or the fees, women are simply turned away.\n\nSeveral women who spoke to this publication said these steep costs and requirements are what force them into the hands of traditional midwives, despite the dangers of home deliveries.\n\nMary David (19), a young mother whose 11-month-old baby was delivered by Vhinya, recalled her ordeal:They wanted a lot of money that I did not have, I did not even have enough preparation for the child, even food to eat here at home so hospital delivery was not an option.\n\nCorruption and mistrust of nurses\n\nSome women who spoke to NewZimbabwe.com raised serious corruption allegations against nurses from the local hospital, saying they demand bribes for you to get help with ill treatment meted out to those who refuse to pay.\n\nRuvimbo Nyakawuru (27), who also had two of her babies with Vhinyas assistance, said she wanted to avoid ill treatment by nurses.\n\nRuvimbo Nyakawuru (27) had two of her babies with Vhinyas assistance.\n\nI gave birth to my first child in a hospital and after that experience, I vowed to never go back there again.\n\nIf you do not pay the nurse a little something for  a drink, even when you are in pain and require attention, they will ignore you and speak to you rudely, in my case, they even told me thatkana usingade kubhadhara hameno hako, mwana wacho ndewako akafa hameno(if you do not want to pay, we do not care, the child is yours).\n\nI saw women giving birth on their own whilst in hospital, Nyakawuru said.\n\nRuvimbo Nyakawuru (27), had two of her babies with Vhinyas assistance.\n\nNoster Chitiva (49) also weighed in, saying the women are treated according to how they look and how much they have paid.\n\nThe nurses treat their patients according to how you look, if you have given them some money for drinks and it is totally different for those who would have paid something.\n\nIf you do not have the money, you suffer, she added.\n\nThis has led to some women deliberately avoiding going to the clinic, even when they can afford it, citing ill treatment by nurses.\n\nFor Freddie Zenda (46), his wife was initially helped by Vhinya to deliver their second-born child as it was an emergency, but their decision to use her services for their third child was intentional.\n\nWhen my wife went into labour the first time, things were really tight and I did not have money for maternity registration at the clinic, so we settled for Ambuya Va52.\n\nHowever, for the second baby, we simply chose her because of the good care we had received the first time as compared to what we had to go through at the clinic during the birth of our first child.\n\nBirths in wheelbarrows\n\nTransport remains one of the biggest barriers for women seeking safe deliveries.\n\nIn some cases, expectant mothers in labour are pushed in wheelbarrows for as far as three kilometres because their families cannot afford to hire cars or ambulances.\n\nSamuel Chigwesa, a father of three, recalled how his wife went into emergency labour even after the family had managed to raise the hospital registration fee.I had managed to raise the required money for hospital delivery, however, my wife got into an emergency labour and I did not have time and money to hire a car and the available option was carrying her to the hospital in a wheelbarrow and she ended up giving birth as we were about to leave.\n\nMost people here cannot afford to hire a car and they end up having to be carried to the hospital in a wheelbarrow, which can take up to an hour, he said.\n\nThe clinic is about 3 kilometres away from Epworth Ward 1.\n\nChigwesa added that in many cases, women give birth on the way, unable to reach the hospital in time, making the journey both painful and dangerous for mothers and their newborns.\n\nMost of these women give birth before they even get to the hospital, Chigwesa added.\n\nWhile home deliveries are common in communities like Epworth, they often come with serious complications.\n\nVhinya said one of the most difficult cases she faced was delivering a baby who had long died inside the mothers womb, suspected to be due to high blood pressure.\n\nThe child came out in pieces; it had long died inside and turned black in colour. It was a scary experience.\n\nThe mother never went for antenatal visits at the hospital; she was just living like nothing was happening and these are some of the challenges we face, she said.\n\nIn another case, Vhinya described delivering a baby in an abnormal position, with one leg emerging first, a situation that would normally require an emergency caesarean section.\n\nIt was a very difficult childbirth, but we managed, she added.\n\nBesides the childbirth process, these women also struggle to obtain documentation for their babies.\n\nIf you give birth at home, getting to have a birth record or baby card will be the worst nightmare as the officials will give you a difficult time, another Epworth resident added.\n\nA child health card\n\nIsheanesu Chirisa, the Women and Law in Southern Africa (WLSA) National Director, said poor maternal healthcare in Zimbabwe requires government action to remove financial barriers, improve access, and integrate traditional birth attendants with skilled medical care.\n\nPoor maternal health care remains a huge stumbling block for most women in Zimbabwe, particularly in marginalised communities.\n\nTo ensure that women in marginalised communities like Epworth have access to safe maternal healthcare, strategies by the government should focus on removing financial barriers, improving health system accessibility, and adaptability, including investing in integrating traditional attendants with skilled healthcare, Chirisa said.\n\nThe situation in Epworth mirrors the reality of home births across many Zimbabwean communities, highlighting the broader crisis of access to healthcare as a fundamental human right.\n\nZimbabwes Constitution enshrines this right: Section 76 guarantees every citizen access to basic healthcare services, including reproductive health, while Section 81 provides special protection for children, affirming their entitlement to healthcare.\n\nBeyond its national laws, Zimbabwe is also bound by international commitments. As a signatory to treaties such as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) and the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), the state carries an obligation to ensure equitable, non-discriminatory access to maternal health services.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nFor the first time in Zimbabwes history, intersex persons have taken the government to court, demanding legal recognition of their rights and protection from decades of systemic exclusion.\n\nThe High Court application, filed under case number HCH4743/25, seeks a declaratory order compelling the state to officially recognise intersex people as a distinct category under Zimbabwean law.\n\nAmong their demands are the introduction of a third sex marker on birth certificates, IDs, and passports, procedures to amend sex markers on documents, and a ban on non-consensual, non-essential surgeries on intersex minors. They also want full access to rights such as dignity, education, healthcare, and equality under the Constitution.\n\nThe case has seven applicants, including two minors denied education and social services because their documents did not reflect their lived realities. One adult applicant was subjected to irreversible surgery as a child, leaving them with lifelong health complications and mismatched identity papers.\n\nThe minors are being represented by their legal guardians.\n\nThe Health Law and Policy Consortium (HLPC) and the Intersex Community of Zimbabwe (ICoZ) have also joined the case as institutional applicants. Cited as respondents are the Registrar-General, the Ministers of Home Affairs, Health, and Justice, and the Attorney General.\n\nIn his founding affidavit, Tinashe Mundawarara, HLPC board chairperson, argued that failure to issue accurate identity documents violates childrens constitutional rights.\n\nSection 81 (1)(c) specifically guarantees every child the right to a birth certificate, he said. By failing to ensure that intersex children are issued birth certificates that reflect their unique biological reality, the respondents deny them a fundamental right and create barriers to accessing essential services such as healthcare and education.\n\nHLPC programs coordinator Dorcas Chitiyo added: This case seeks to address the systematic legal and administrative failures that have perpetuated exclusion, discrimination and harm against intersex persons in Zimbabwe.\n\nICoZ director Kudakwashe Murisa said intersex people have endured silence and invisibility for too long.\n\nThis case is historic. For the first time, the Zimbabwean legal system is being challenged to recognise the rights of intersex individuals as equal human beings under the Constitution, they said.\n\nMurisa stressed that the matter goes beyond individual struggles.\n\nThis case is not just about one individual. It is about an entire community that has been made invisible for too long. It is about ensuring that no intersex child will endure what so many others have suffered in silence.\n\nAs an intersex person, Murisa described the personal toll of mismatched documents: Being intersex, I have to explain myself each time I want to use my identity documents. This is because they dont match with the sex I was assigned at birth.\n\nThe matter is yet to be heard.\n\n",

The CEO is alleged to have acted in common purpose with Christopher Muchechemera from the finance department in authorising these payments, said ZACC.\n\nIn another alleged irregularity, Mushanawani is accused of entering into a contract with Diztech (Pvt) Ltd worth US$79,467 for consultancy and training services that were already included in the Farevic Systems agreement.\n\nZACC said such double-dipping contracts prejudiced NetOne of substantial resources. These contracts were neither sanctioned by the board nor necessary, as the original Farevic contract covered the same services.\n\nMushanawani is expected in court this Tuesday.\n\n",

All told, the ZDF will get over 700 vehicles, the first ever time that ZDF has received such a consignment within a short-time bracket, Charamba announced on his X account on Monday.\n\nThe timing has raised eyebrows, with many viewing the gesture as a clear coup-proofing strategy.\n\nCharamba defended the move, framing it as a fulfilment of service conditions for senior officers: The vehicles, which are part of the conditions of service for senior army officers, plug a gap in conditions of service for officers, some of whom had gone for a couple of years without a full set of their entitlements.\n\nHowever, he also revealed the allocation is structured as a loan. In public sector parlance, these vehicles are called personal issue service vehicles. What that means is that the vehicle is personal to the haver, who is also allowed to buy the vehicle after a stipulated time.\n\nThe development has already sparked public scrutiny, with critics demanding clarity on the source of funds and whether the purchase was accounted for in the 2025 national budget.\n\nObservers warn Zimbabwe is increasingly resembling a mafia-style economy where political elites distribute vehicles and perks like candy to loyalists and strategic allies in order to cling to power.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nZimbabwe is Africas biggest producer of tobacco but some farmers believe the countrys long-term future could lie in a very different crop  blueberries.\n\nThanks to a breakthrough in trade talks with China, the worlds biggest importer of the nutrient-rich fruit, Zimbabwe has taken a major step towards achieving its ambition of becoming Africas blueberry capital.\n\nTobacco sales surged to a record $1.3bn (1bn) last year, helped by the rising number of smokers in China.\n\nIn contrast, blueberry exports were worth a more modest $30m but horticulture specialist Clarence Mwale is undaunted.\n\nThe future is food, not a bad habit, he tells the BBC at his warehouse in Harare.\n\nFor the first time, China has agreed to import Zimbabwean blueberries and, crucially, has exempted them from tariffs, in a boost for the southern African states struggling economy.\n\nWe have to strike while the iron is hot, exuberant blueberry farmer Alistair Campbell tells the BBC.\n\nCurrently exporting to Europe, the Middle East and South East Asia, farmers like Campbell would be gaining access to a massive new market, once Zimbabwe passes Chinas compliance tests on pest and disease control.\n\nA former captain of Zimbabwes cricket team, 53-year-old Campbell co-owns a high-tech 50 hectare (123 acres) blueberry farm about an hour from the capital, Harare.\n\nEach of the 240,000 plants on the farm is grown in a pot imported from the Netherlands or South Africa. The pot soil is also imported.\n\nThe plants are watered eight times a day, with specially treated water, and the blueberries are kept in refrigerators soon after they are harvested to maintain freshness.\n\nCampbell said that although it was a demanding fruit to grow, the rewards are worth it, especially as global demand is increasing for what some describe as a superfood, with high levels of vitamins and anti-oxidants.\n\nCampbell believes Zimbabwe can cash in on the rising demand, as the fruit comes into season early, in late March, hitting the market ahead of major competitors like Peru.\n\nIts all about Peru avoidance, laughs Campbell.\n\nPeru is both a bitter rival and an inspiration for Zimbabwes farmers. In the last 10 to 15 years, it has gone from being responsible for less than 2% of global blueberry production to becoming the largest exporter of the fruit.\n\nZimbabwes production this year is expected to rise by 50% to 12,000 tonnes.\n\nMorocco currently leads Africas production with more than 80,000 tonnes in 2024.\n\nSouth Africa, Zimbabwes neighbour, produced 25,000 tonnes.\n\nWith South Africa being severely hit by US tariffs, it is looking for new markets for its fruit, with China being an obvious one, especially as it has promised zero tariffs for all African states, except Eswatini because of its close ties with Taiwan.\n\nThe Washington Post via Getty Images Blueberries have become increasingly popular because of their health benefits\n\nChina has not yet agreed to take South African blueberries, raising hopes among farmers in Zimbabwe that they will enter the lucrative market first.\n\nThe Zimbabwean and Chinese governments struck the deal earlier this month, offering what has been described as anunprecedented opportunity for local producers to access one of the worlds fastest-growing blueberry markets.\n\nThis agreement is a milestone for Zimbabwes horticultural sector, says Zimbabwes Horticultural Development Council executive director Linda Nielsen.\n\nWe now need collaboration to design policies that increase investment, boost production, and ensure our blueberries meet Chinas strict quality and phytosanitary standards, she adds.\n\nZimbabwe farmers are now looking for capital to boost blueberry production to 30,000 tonnes by 2030.\n\nExpressing caution about whether this can be achieved, Campbell tells the BBC: Its all good saying Zimbabwe is open for business but the underlying fundamentals need to be correct.\n\nMany analysts say that more than 20 years after the governments controversial land reform programme led to the seizure of many white-owned farms, investors remain uncertain about the security of their land, despite a new law that does away with leases and offers full title to resettled farmers.\n\nWith Zimbabwe experiencing a severe cash crisis, exporters are required to surrender almost a third of their foreign-currency earnings to the central bank in exchange for local currency  something that many Zimbabweans are loathe to do, fearing it will lose its value.\n\nLast year Zimbabwe generated $30m (22.5m) from blueberry exports.\n\nThe amount may be modest, but with unemployment high, the jobs the industry creates are welcome. It employs about 6,000 people, mostly women.\n\nShingai Nyoka / BBC Rebecca Bonzo says blueberry farms are a source of employment for women\n\nIts delicate hands that are needed for a delicate fruit, Rebecca Bonzo, a supervisor at Campbells farm, tells the BBC in the Shona language.\n\nUp to 300 women work during the peak harvesting season. Many are sole breadwinners who can now take care of their families, she says.\n\nClarence Mwale  the founder of Kuminda, which represents a collective of small- and medium-scale farmers  says he is pushing more of them to become involved in blueberry farming.\n\nHe says he has achieved this with other crops  for instance, about 5,000 small-scale farmers now supply horticultural products, mainly mange touts and sugar snap peas, to the UK and other European markets, something that was unheard of 15 to 20 years ago.\n\nMwale says he is now looking for about 100 young farmers to diversify into blueberry farming and benefit from Chinas decision to open the market to Zimbabweans.\n\nAs the Chinese market opens upit gives us much more scope, he tells the BBC. Where we were scrambling and fighting for the European markets, which we havent been able to fulfil, now we have a vast market that we have to fill.\n\nIt gives everyone a chance to get into the blueberry production.\n\nZimbabwe has traditionally been tobacco country.\n\nBut having fuelled a bad habit in China, it now wants to promote a health food there, hoping in the process to acquire the status of Africas blueberry capital.\n\n",

We start campaigning tomorrow, Herminie said in a televised address.\n\nPublic disquiet over the sovereignty and ecological stewardship of Assumption Island, one of the archipelagos most eco-sensitive territories, surfaced in recent days as an electoral touchpoint, following the islands leasing to a foreign hotel developer.\n\nThe issue may energise decisive backing from the six trailing presidential candidates and their supporters ahead of the run-off ballot slated for 9-11 October.\n\nSeychelles is renown for luxury and environmental tourism and is Africas wealthiest country in terms of average income per person, according to the World Bank.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe Zimbabwe Gold (ZWG) currency recorded a marginal decline in inflation last month, with the month-on-month rate easing to 0.2%, raising hopes that annual inflation,still in double digits,will continue to recede through year-end, the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (Zimstat) reported Monday.\n\nAccording to the latest data, the ZWG has maintained notable stability against the US dollar since September 2024, when it last registered a major dip.\n\nThe ZWG month-on-month inflation rate was 0.2% in September 2025, shedding 0.6 percentage points from the August 2025 rate of 0.4%. This means that prices, as measured by the all-items ZWG Consumer Price Index (CPI), decreased by an average of 0.2% between August and September 2025, Zimstat said.\n\nFood and Non-Alcoholic Beverages recorded a month-on-month inflation rate of 0.2% in September, up from 0.1% in August. In contrast, non-food inflation fell to 0.5%, down from 0.6% in the previous month.\n\nYear-on-year, however, inflation remains elevated. The ZWG year-on-year inflation rate for September 2025 was 82.7%, meaning prices increased by an average of 82.7% compared to September 2024, Zimstat added.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has continued to pursue a tight monetary policy to safeguard the ZiG currency introduced in April 2024. This has included maintaining a high policy rate to curb speculative borrowing and anchor both inflation and exchange rate expectations.\n\nMeanwhile, Zimstat reported that US dollar inflation remained steady, with the September 2025 month-on-month rate unchanged at 0%, while year-on-year inflation stood at 13.4%.\n\nOn the poverty benchmarks, the Food Poverty Line (FPL) for one person in September was ZWG 877.03, while the Total Consumption Poverty Line (TCPL) stood at ZWG 1,292.80,the minimum needed per person to cover both food and non-food requirements.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has reported a 4% increase in armed robbery cases between January and August this year, a rise officials partly attribute to the forces acute shortage of vehicles, equipment, and manpower needed to effectively combat crime.\n\nDeputy Police Commissioner for Administration Leny Ncube told the Defence, Security and Home Affairs Parliamentary Portfolio Committee during an oral evidence hearing on Tuesday that while general robbery cases fell by 8% over the same period, armed robberies  the most violent category  remain a growing concern.\n\nOur analysis of crime statistics for the period January to August 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, reveals a different picture. We have recorded an overall 8% decrease in total robbery cases. However, there is a concerning 4% increase in the most violent category,robberies committed using firearms, Ncube said.\n\nHe added that the ZRP was fully alert to the threat and taking action within its means, but warned that the shortage of resources was undermining the polices ability to respond effectively.\n\nWhile government has over the past years availed operational vehicles, we continue to experience shortages as our ageing fleet is susceptible to breakdowns, hampering rapid response to crime scenes. The sad reality is that we are often outpaced by criminals using high-powered vehicles, Ncube said.\n\nOf the ZRPs required 9,320 vehicles, the force currently has 2,830, of which 1,007 are grounded due to breakdowns,leaving only 1,823 operational, roughly 20% of its needs.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner also highlighted that criminal syndicates were becoming increasingly sophisticated, with some involving former security service members who brought expertise to their operations. These groups, he said, were using cloned vehicles, counter-intelligence tactics, and advanced technologies, leaving the ZRP ill-equipped.\n\nWe lack advanced technology to monitor the movement of sophisticated and transnational criminals. In todays environment, where criminal activity is being propelled by technology, technology-driven policing ceases to be a luxury,it is now essential if we are to remain relevant, Ncube stressed.\n\nTo mitigate the surge in armed robberies, the police are encouraging businesses to invest in functional CCTV systems and alarm technologies.\n\nThe ZRP is steadily advancing its capabilities through the strategic adoption of technology to combat armed robberies. Our focus is on both prevention and investigation, and we are championing the adoption of security technologies within the business community, Ncube said.\n\n",

Its the start of a new chapter.\n\nThe bridge has a high-speed glass elevator that can send visitors to a coffee spot 2,600 feet above the river. Visitors can also try bungee jumping or a 1,900-foot-high glass walkway.\n\nThe province of Guizhou, which is home to about 40 million people, has undergone an infrastructure campaign in recent decades as part of theChinese governments war on poverty. It now has more than 32,000 bridges that are either completed or under construction, compared with about 2,900 in the 1980s.\n\nGuizhou is also home to what is now the worlds second-highest bridge, Duge Bridge, which opened in 2016.\n\n",
