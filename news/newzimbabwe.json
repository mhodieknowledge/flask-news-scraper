You dont know what Im going through.

This was by far the hardest weight loss journey for me because I have done this three times and I now knew what it would take for me to get back in shape. To be honest, mentally I didnt feel like I was as strong as I once was and I was demoralised.\n\nIts supposed to get easier by the day but it got harder and harder. I just kept waking up and going. Lost touch with a lot of relationships and people because I zoned into this goal and I had no time for anyone but myself.\n\nLooking at these pictures now Im in awe of myself. I owe it to myself never to let myself go like that again. Big shout out to my training and nutrition team. Shout out to Fight Club for always having their doors open for me at any time I wanted to train. We four weeks out Boys! Lets put on a show! Im back!\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nFor years, visitors would venture up Mount Sinai with a Bedouin guide to watch the sunrise over the pristine, rocky landscape or go on other Bedouin-led hikes.\n\nNow one of Egypts most sacred places  revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims  is at the heart of an unholy row over plans to turn it into a new tourism mega-project.\n\nKnown locally as Jabal Musa, Mount Sinai is where Moses is said to have been given the Ten Commandments. Many also believe that this is the place where, according to the Bible and the Quran, God spoke to the prophet from the burning bush.\n\nThe 6th century St Catherines Monastery, run by the Greek Orthodox Church, is also there  and seemingly its monks will stay on now that Egyptian authorities, under Greek pressure, have denied wanting to close it.\n\nHowever, there is still deep concern about how the long-isolated, desert location  a Unesco World Heritage site comprising the monastery, town and mountain  is being transformed. Luxury hotels, villas and shopping bazaars are under construction there.\n\nThe long-isolated desert location is being transformed\n\nIt is also home to a traditional Bedouin community, the Jebeleya tribe. Already the tribe, known as the Guardians of St Catherine, have had their homes and tourist eco-camps demolished with little or no compensation. They have even been forced to take bodies out of their graves in the local cemetery to make way for a new car park.\n\nThe project may have been presented as desperately needed sustainable development which will boost tourism, but it has also been imposed on the Bedouin against their will, says Ben Hoffler, a British travel writer who has worked closely with Sinai tribes.\n\nThis is not development as the Jebeleya see it or asked for it, but how it looks when imposed top-down to serve the interests of outsiders over those of the local community, he told the BBC.\n\nA new urban world is being built around a Bedouin tribe of nomadic heritage, he added. Its a world they have always chosen to remain detached from, to whose construction they did not consent, and one that will change their place in their homeland forever.\n\nLocals, who number about 4,000, are unwilling to speak directly about the changes.\n\nBen Hoffler Construction in the Plain of el-Raha in 2024\n\nSo far, Greece is the foreign power which has been most vocal about the Egyptian plans, because of its connection to the monastery.\n\nTensions between Athens and Cairo flared up after an Egyptian court ruled in May that St Catherines  the worlds oldest continuously used Christian monastery  lies on state land.\n\nAfter a decades-long dispute, judges said that the monastery was only entitled to use the land it sits on and the archaeological religious sites which dot its surroundings.\n\nArchbishop Ieronymos II of Athens, head of the Church of Greece, was quick to denounce the ruling.\n\nThe monasterys property is being seized and expropriated. This spiritual beacon of Orthodoxy and Hellenism is now facing an existential threat, he said in a statement.\n\nIn a rare interview, St Catherines longtime Archbishop Damianos told a Greek newspaper the decision was a grave blow for us and a disgrace. His handling of the affair led to bitter divisions between the monks and his recent decision to step down.\n\nThe Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Jerusalem pointed out that the holy site  over which it has ecclesiastical jurisdiction  had been granted a letter of protection by the Prophet Muhammad himself.\n\nIt said that the Byzantine monastery  which unusually also houses a small mosque built in the Fatimid era  was an enshrinement of peace between Christians and Muslims and a refuge of hope for a world mired by conflict.\n\nWhile the controversial court ruling remains in place, a flurry of diplomacy ultimately culminated in a joint declaration between Greece and Egypt ensuring the protection of St Catherines Greek Orthodox identity and cultural heritage.\n\nBen Hoffler Mount Sinai, known locally as Jabal Musa, is where Moses is said to have been given the Ten Commandments\n\nEgypt began its state-sponsored Great Transfiguration Project for tourists in 2021. The plan includes opening hotels, eco-lodges and a large visitor centre, as well as expanding the small nearby airport and a cable car to Mount Moses.\n\nThe government is promoting the development as Egypts gift to the entire world and all religions.\n\nThe project will provide all tourism and recreational services for visitors, promote the development of the town [of St Catherine] and its surrounding areas while preserving the environmental, visual, and heritage character of the pristine nature, and provide accommodation for those working on St Catherines projects, Housing Minister Sherif el-Sherbiny said last year.\n\nWhile work does appear to have stalled, at least temporarily, due to funding issues, the Plain of el-Raha  in view of St Catherines Monastery  has already been transformed. Construction is continuing on new roads.\n\nThis is where the followers of Moses, the Israelites, are said to have waited for him during his time on Mount Sinai. And critics say the special natural characteristics of the area are being destroyed.\n\nDetailing the outstanding universal value of the site, Unesco notes how the rugged mountainous landscape around forms a perfect backdrop for the Monastery.\n\nIt says: Its siting demonstrates a deliberate attempt to establish an intimate bond between natural beauty and remoteness on the one hand and human spiritual commitment on the other.\n\nBen Hoffler The area is known for its natural beauty and rugged mountainous landscape\n\nBack in 2023, Unesco highlighted its concerns and called on Egypt to stop developments, check their impact and produce a conservation plan.\n\nThis has not happened.\n\nIn July, World Heritage Watch sent an open letter calling on Unescos World Heritage Committee to place the St Catherines area on the List of World Heritage Sites in Danger.\n\nCampaigners have also approached King Charles as patron of the St Catherine Foundation, which raises funds to help conserve and study the monasterys heritage with its collection of valuable ancient Christian manuscripts. The King has described the site as a great spiritual treasure that should be maintained for future generations.\n\nThe mega-project is not the first in Egypt to draw criticism for a lack of sensitivity to the countrys unique history.\n\nBut the government sees its series of grandiose schemes as key to reinvigorating the flagging economy.\n\nEgypts once-thriving tourism sector had begun to recover from the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic when it was hit by the brutal war in Gaza and a new wave of regional instability. The government has declared an aim of reaching 30 million visitors by 2028.\n\nUnder successive Egyptian governments, commercial development of the Sinai has been carried out without consulting the indigenous Bedouin communities.\n\nThe peninsula was captured by Israel during the 1967 Middle East War and only returned to Egypt after the two countries signed a peace treaty in 1979. The Bedouin have since complained of being treated like second-class citizens.\n\nThe construction of Egypts popular Red Sea destinations, including Sharm el-Sheikh, began in South Sinai in the 1980s. Many see similarities with what is happening at St Catherines now.\n\nThe Bedouin were the people of the region, and they were the guides, the workers, the people to rent from, says Egyptian journalist Mohannad Sabry.\n\nThen industrial tourism came in and they were pushed out  not just pushed out of the business but physically pushed back from the sea into the background.\n\nBen Hoffler A hotel under construction in the Plain of el-Raha in 2024\n\nAs with the Red Sea locations, it is expected that Egyptians from elsewhere in the country will be brought in to work at the new St Catherines development. However, the government says it is also upgrading Bedouin residential areas.\n\nSt Catherines Monastery has endured many upheavals through the past millennium and a half but, when the oldest of the monks at the site originally moved there, it was still a remote retreat.\n\nThat began to change as the expansion of the Red Sea resorts brought thousands of pilgrims on day trips at peak times.\n\nIn recent years, large crowds would often be seen filing past what is said to be the remnants of the burning bush or visiting a museum displaying pages from the Codex Sinaiticus  the worlds oldest surviving, nearly complete, handwritten copy of the New Testament.\n\nNow, even though the monastery and the deep religious significance of the site will remain, its surroundings and centuries-long ways of life look set to be irreversibly changed.\n\n",

Something must have gone seriously wrong.\n\nOnias argued the property was a donation that could be revoked because Pride had become disrespectful and violent towards him, and had even tried to sell it against his wishes.\n\nBut the court ruled there was never a valid donation. There was never an intention to gratuitously and without obligation give the 1st respondent the property, Justice Muzofa said. There were strings attached. The applicant intended to continue to derive a benefit from the property.\n\nThe judge stressed that while Onias funded the purchase, the house was always registered in Prides name. The evidence before the Court strongly shows that the applicant purchased the property for the 1st respondent and he had strings attached, the judge said.\n\nDismissing the claim with costs, the judge concluded: Revocation can only be made where there is a valid donation.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court of Zimbabwe has dismissed a bid by Emmanuel Dumbu to overturn the appointment of Matubede Mudavanhu as Chief Mugabe, ruling that the succession dispute had reached a stalemate that justified presidential intervention.\n\nDumbu had cited President Emmerson Mnangagwa, Local Government minister and Mudavanhu as respondents.\n\nDumbu had argued that his rivals appointment was irregular, illegitimate and unconstitutional, claiming he was the rightful heir under the Mugabe clans collateral system of rotation. He maintained that a 2022 meeting of the five royal houses had nominated him as the successor.\n\nBut Justice Herbert Zisengwe, sitting at the Masvingo High Court, said the appointment of Mudavanhu was valid, stressing that the traditional process had failed to produce consensus. There was a stalemate and this effectively left the Minister with no option but to invoke the proviso to section 3(2) of the Traditional Leaders Act, the judge ruled.\n\nThe court noted that Mudavanhu had already served as acting chief since 2009, adding: His appointment cannot be said to be inimical to the customs, traditions and culture of the community in question.\n\nOn the disputed 2022 Chikarudzo meeting, which Dumbu relied on, the judge was blunt: It would be an exercise in futility to repeat the same process and expect a different result.\n\nJustice Zisengwe also warned that Zimbabwes laws must provide a mechanism to end deadlocks in future disputes: Such a provision is a necessary tie breaker; a necessary tool to break any possible impasse.\n\nThe court dismissed Dumbus application with costs, cementing Mudavanhus position as substantive Chief Mugabe after nearly 14 years in an acting role.\n\nArguing his case,Dumbu said he is the legitimate heir to the throne.\n\nHe alleged that the appointment of Mudavanhu flouted what he termed the Mugabe chieftainships collateral system of rotation among the five houses, each with a right to the throne at any given time.\n\nThese houses are the Dumbu, Chipfunhu, Haruzivishe, Chikamhi (Muzondo) and Mudavanhu houses.\n\nAccording to him, the houses take turns in succeeding to the throne in order of seniority.\n\nThe term house is customary parlance for family. In short, the eldest child (usually the eldest son) of the founder of the clan is considered the most senior and basically establishes the most senior house.\n\nEach of his brothers established the second house and subsequent houses in order of seniority.\n\nWhat the collateral system of rotation envisages, therefore, is that the eldest member of the first family succeeds his father.\n\nUpon his death, his most senior brother takes over, followed by the third and so on.\n\nThis cycle is repeated with each successive generation.\n\nDumbu said Musavanhu was irregularly appointed after he had served about 13 years as an acting chief following the demise of one Mute Mudavanhu of the Mudavanhu house.\n\nHe further asserts that the incessant complaints raised by the affected people over the prolonged tenure of the third respondent as acting chief initially went unheeded but eventually the Provincial Assembly of Chiefs seconded three chiefs from the province (namely Chief Nhema, Chitanga and Serima) to resolve the matter.\n\nThis culminated in a meeting held on 31 October 2022 at a creche at Chikarudzo Business Centre, dubbed the Chikarudzo meeting. This meeting was convened to deliberate over the appointment of substantive Chief Mugabe.\n\nMost importantly, the applicant avers that at that meeting all five houses were represented and it was agreed that the Dumbu house, to which he belongs, was to succeed the Mudavanhu house. When the Dumbu house was requested to name the person to take up the throne, he was identified as the one to do so.\n\nAccording to him, therefore, he was duly nominated as the heir to the throne.\n\nTo his dismay, however, he learnt on 13 February 2023 that Mudavanhu had been appointed Chief Mugabe.\n\n",

Leave me alone, said Holy Ten.\n\nOnce the fastest rising talent in Zimbabwes music industry, Holy Tens career took a nasty nose dive after he laid into popular Zim Dance Hall chanter Winky D.\n\nHis tirade against Winky D, which came after the release of a red hot collaboration,Ibotso, was blamed on unidentified drugs and alcohol, a challenge he has accepted to have been dealing with for over two years. Ibotso, which he disputed, highlighted how the high and mighty were taking all that was supposed to benefit the downtrodden.\n\nHis tweet, however, comes a day after he apologised for his online tirade, captured live on Instagram.\n\nI joined Zanu PF because I was trying to clean the reputation, the image of Zanu PF.
