The announcement occurred just days after the Nobel Committee in Oslo announced that Venezuelan opposition leaderMaria Corina Machadohad won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for fighting dictatorship in the South American country.\n\nThe embassy closures with the two US allies also followed weeks of escalating tensions between Caracas and Washington.\n\nVenezuela has called on the UN for support over several deadly US military strikes on vessels off its Caribbean coast, which Washington alleges were carrying drugs.\n\nSome US allies on the UN Security Council called for de-escalation and dialogue.\n\nVenezuela has said it is in a situation where it is rational to expect an armed attack against the country in the short term, and Maduro has alleged the US is seeking a change in government.\n\nWashington has not responded to this accusation but has called Venezuelas socialist leader the illegitimate head of a narco-state. The US has also announced a new counter-narcotics task force in its Southern Command, a military branch that oversees Latin America.\n\nThe governments of Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso are more aligned with that of Russia, which has supported Venezuela at the UN and accused the US of acting according to the cowboy principle of shoot first.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nMadagascars embattled President Andry Rajoelina has said he is sheltering in a safe place after an attempt on his life, following weeks of protests calling for him to quit.\n\nIn a live broadcast to the nation on Facebook, Rajoelina, 51, said a group of military personnel and politicians planned to assassinate me.\n\nHe did not reveal his location, but unconfirmed reports earlier suggested that he had fled the country on a French military aircraft.\n\nIt follows a fortnight of nationwide protests, mainly led by young demonstrators, aimed at kicking him out of power.\n\nRajoelinas failed attempts to placate the young protesters  dubbed Gen Z Mada  saw the president sack his entire government and makeother concessionsto no avail.\n\nHe has not been seen since Wednesday, and at the weekend Rajoelinas office said an attempt was under way to force him from power.\n\nHis address to the nation was delayed several times on Monday amid the chaos, as soldiers threatened to seize the state TV headquarters in the Indian Ocean island.\n\nEventually, in the Facebook broadcast he said: Since 25 September, there have been attempts on my life and coup attempts. A group of military personnel and politicians planned to assassinate me.\n\nI was forced to find a safe place to protect my life.\n\nThere is only one way to resolve these issues; that is to respect the constitution in force in the country.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Young people spearheaded nationwide rallies demanding a fairer deal for citizens\n\nOver the weekend, CAPSAT, a powerful army unit that helped install Rajoelina into power in 2009 moved to undermine him by declaring itself in command of all the armed forces, while some of its officers joined protesters on the streets of the capital, Antananarivo.\n\nFollowing a meeting of military commanders on Monday, the new Chief of Army Staff installed by CAPSAT, Gen Demosthene Pikulas, assured the public that the security forces were working together to maintain order in the island nation.\n\nBy Monday evening, the general was at state TV headquarters trying to resolve the crisis, according to a statement from the presidency.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, a senior leader in Madagascars largest opposition party, TIM, told the BBC that Madagascar was now effectively being run by the army unit.\n\nThe TIM party has also said that it plans to bring impeachment proceedings against Rajoelina for abandonment of post.\n\nSeveral of Rajoelinas inner circle have fled to nearby Mauritius. They include former Prime Minister President Richard Ravalomanana and the businessman Maminiaina Ravatomanga.\n\nDespite its abundant natural resources, Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world. About 75% of people there live below the poverty line, the World Bank says, while data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) shows just over one-third of people have access to electricity.\n\nThe protests began over anger with repeated water and power cuts, then escalated to reflect wider dissatisfaction with Rajoelinas government over high unemployment, corruption and the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nAt least 22 people were killed and more than 100 injured in the first few days of the protests, according to the UN, although the government has rejected these figures.\n\nEyewitnesses describe security officers opening fire on protesters with live ammunition. In one case,a newborn baby diedfrom smoke inhalation after being exposed to tear gas.\n\nMadagascar has been rocked by multiple uprisings since it gained independence in 1960, including mass protests in 2009 that forced then-President Marc Ravalomanana to step down and saw Rajoelina ushered into office.\n\nAged just 34 at the time, Rajoelina became Africas youngest leader  going on to govern for four years, then returning to power again after the 2018 election.\n\nRajoelina was born into wealth and, before entering politics, had made a name for himself as an entrepreneur and DJ  setting up a radio station and an advertising company along the way.\n\nBut his sharp-suited, baby-faced appeal soon waned, as allegations of cronyism and entrenched corruption became unshakeable.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Harare has urged its nationals and investors operating in Zimbabwe to strictly comply with local investment laws, regulations, and ethical standards.\n\nIn a notice issued this week, the embassy reminded Chinese investors to conduct thorough due diligence and risk assessments before undertaking any projects in the country.\n\nThe advisory follows mounting concern over a recent fatal shooting of a villager at a Chinese-owned mine in Mutoko, allegedly on suspicion of attempted theft. The incident has reignited public debate over the conduct of some Chinese investors, with calls for government to review foreign operations after the Centre for Natural Resources Governance (CNRG) released a video exposing poor working and living conditions at a Chinese-run mine in Mashava.\n\nPrior to committing capital, undertake a comprehensive and thorough assessment of Zimbabwes political, economic, social, and legal landscape. Go beyond financial metrics to gain a good understanding of the local investment climate, business culture, community dynamics, and socio-cultural norms including traditions and customs, the embassy said.\n\nIt added: Scrutinise all project details, with a particular focus on identifying potential risks and avenues for resolving disputes, establishing robust risk management protocols from the outset. Avoid involvement in any ventures that might lead to controversies or disputes.\n\nThe embassy also called on investors to prioritise personal and asset security.\n\nImplement proactive security measures upon arrival. This includes engaging reputable professional security services, optimising physical safeguards, and developingthen regularly rehearsingcomprehensive contingency plans for possible emergencies.\n\nAmid growing criticism over some investors alleged disregard for due process, the embassy reminded its citizens to resolve disputes through legal channels and to observe firearm regulations.\n\nAdhere strictly to legal and regulatory frameworks. Compliance with Zimbabwean laws and regulations is the non-negotiable foundation of all operations.\n\nAll disputes must be resolved through proper legal channels. Proactively seek advice and assistance from qualified legal counsel. In the event of criminal incidents such as theft, burglary, or robbery, while ensuring your personal safety, your immediate priority is to report the incident to the local police without delay. Should the police be unreachable or unable to dispatch officers immediately, you should remain calm and composed, and try to avoid any direct confrontation.\n\nEnforce strict firearms control. The illegal possession of firearms is strictly prohibited. The storage and use of any legally authorised firearms must be managed with the highest level of control and in full compliance with relevant regulations.\n\nThe embassy further encouraged Chinese companies to foster goodwill through responsible community engagement and environmental stewardship.\n\nAct as a partner in Zimbabwes development. Wherever possible, engage with local communities respectfully and responsibly. Consistently uphold fair labour practices and demonstrate environmental stewardship in line with all relevant laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility initiatives are strongly encouraged as visible expressions of goodwill. Such proactive efforts foster mutual trust, strengthen community relations and affirm a shared commitment to Zimbabwes broader economic development and social progress.\n\nThe statement also emphasised that any grievances or threats to personal safety must be handled lawfully.\n\nIf faced with unfair treatment or rights infringement, remain calm and rational. Meticulously collect and preserve all relevant evidence. Your primary recourse is always through the established legal framework, supported by professional legal representation.\n\nIn the face of smears or disinformation, a proactive and strategic response is crucial. Engage legal counsel and seek assistance from relevant authorities to manage the situation and protect your reputation and legitimate rights and interests.\n\nThe embassy reiterated that corruption and bribery are criminal offences both in Zimbabwe and China.\n\nUnder no circumstances should bribes be offered, accepted, or solicited. If you encounter any form of corruption, including solicitation, extortion, or abuse of power, report it promptly to the Zimbabwe Republic Police and/or Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission.\n\nIn light of growing reports of labour and human rights abuses involving some Chinese-run enterprises, the embassy urged all companies to register with it after obtaining licences from relevant Zimbabwean authorities.\n\nThis, it said, would enable the embassy to provide timely consular protection and assistance when required.\n\n",
