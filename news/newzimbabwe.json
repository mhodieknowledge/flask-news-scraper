            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has revised the sentence of a commuter omnibus driver, ruling that a magistrate had gone too far in imposing a lifetime driving ban across all vehicle classes following a reckless driving conviction.\n\nRuzvidzo Freedom was convicted in June 2025 of reckless driving after he drove a Toyota Hiace kombi into oncoming traffic at the intersection of Second Street Extension and Upper East Road, Harare. Though no accident occurred, the trial court jailed him for two years and prohibited him from driving vehicles in classes 2, 4 and 5 for life, cancelling his licence entirely.\n\nOn automatic review, Justices Esther Muremba and Munamato Mutevedzi upheld the two-year mandatory jail term but blasted the blanket lifetime prohibition as a misdirection in law.\n\nThe trial magistrates decision to prohibit the accused from driving classes 2, 4, and 5 for life without distinguishing between the vehicle involved in the offence and other classes was therefore excessive and ultra vires, the judges ruled. Imposing a lifetime driving ban across all classes of motor vehicles on a first-time offender is a measure so severe that it should be reserved only for exceptional circumstances.\n\nThe court found that the magistrate had misapplied Section 53 of the Road Traffic Act, which provides escalating penalties based on repeat offences. For first-time offenders, the law prescribes a mandatory two-year minimum sentence plus a lifetime ban only from driving commuter omnibuses or heavy vehicles, not light motor vehicles.\n\nDriving against oncoming traffic signifies utter recklessness.\n\nBut apart from that, the magistrate must have noted that the offender was not involved in any accident, and there were no aggravating factors such as injury or damage. The degree of recklessness remained at the base of the recklessness ladder.\n\nThe High Court also warned magistrates against arbitrary prohibitions. A magistrate who plucks a prohibition from nowhere commits a gross irregularity which vitiates their decision.\n\nThe High Court reduced the lifetime ban to six months for light vehicles (Classes 4 and 5), while confirming that Freedom remains barred for life from driving commuter omnibuses (Class 2).\n\nHis licence was cancelled accordingly.\n\nThe judges ordered the trial magistrate to recall the offender from prison and formally advise him of the corrected sentence, ensuring the Registrar of Road Traffic Licences makes the proper amendments.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nSouth African star Tyla had a powerful moment of humanity during her set at the2025 Global Citizen Festivalin New York.\n\nWhile performing her Grammy-winning hit Water, she stopped mid-song after noticing a fan who had fainted in the crowd.\n\nThe 23-year-old asked production to pause as she called for staff to assist an audience member.\n\nThe music came to a halt, and silence filled Central Parks Great Lawn as the fan received attention. Tyla kept her focus on the situation, later checking in with concertgoers who were nearby to make sure everything was under control\n\nWhen they signalled that all was well, she smiled warmly before asking the crowd whether she should continue where she left off or restart the song. The question led to the audience erupting in excitement, choosing the restart option.\n\nThe popiano star showed care for her fans in the middle of what was already a vibrant night of performances.\n\nLater in the night, Tyla brought a different kind of energy when she performed Mr Media, a song where she directly responds to her critics.\n\nThe song is one of her sassiest, with lyrics that carry a sharp none of your concern message, shutting down outside noise.\n\nAt one point, she sings: Remember when I used to fight with words? Really, I should be worse, I should be meaner What I? None of your concern.\n\nIts essentially a mic drop with Tyla reminding everyone that she can clap back, but often chooses not to.\n\nThat context made it all the more fitting when, mid-performance, she told the Global Citizen audience she is not sorry.\n\nThe statement comes after Nigerian star Tiwa Savageweighed in on Tylas ongoing coloured identity controversyduring an interview on The Breakfast Club, causing online outrage.\n\nSavage said she understood why the term is offensive in America, but also expressed sympathy for Tyla.\n\nI would get why that would be such a huge thing here, because of the history behind that name, she said. I think I felt for her a little bit because she is young and I do not think she means to come across like that.\n\nSavage went further by apologising on Tylas behalf, saying, So if that was not communicated, I would like to say on behalf of her, we apologise. We did not mean it, forgive us. I do not think it came from a bad place.\n\nShakira and Cardi B were among the stars who lit up the 2025 Global Citizen festival, joined by Ayra Starr and Mariah the Scientist.\n\nThis years festival, which took place on September 27, was hosted once again by Hugh Jackman, placing a strong emphasis on African voices and global issues.\n\nThe event is part of the Global Citizen movement, which blends music and activism to fight poverty, inequality, and climate change.\n\nOne of the key initiatives this year focused on bringing energy access to one million people across Africa.\n\n",

            "content": "By James Muonwa\n\nCARBON Green Investments (CGI) has expressed commitment to implement its suspended Kariba REDD+ Project on forests conservation and community support in Zimbabwe.\n\nThis position follows endorsement by Verra, which is the global carbon credits regulatory body, acknowledging that the status of retired Kariba REDD+ credits will not change, and remain valid in their registry, meaning previously purchased credits also stay valid notwithstanding the baseline reassessment.\n\nThe carbon project owner says it welcomes Verras report, which it will scrutinise together with officials from the Government of Zimbabwe.\n\nCGI thanks Verra for providing its update and results from their review of the Kariba REDD+ Project, as outlined in their September 23, 2025, letter and public statement, said GCI in a statement.\n\nIn response, CGI, in collaboration with the Government of Zimbabwe, will carefully review Verras outcome. To ensure a thorough, true, and accurate outcome, CGI has concluded independent third-party assessments of the carbon accounting and related matters, using all up-to-date data, scientific findings and appropriate methodologies. From this evaluation, CGI will partner with the new registry to address and mitigate any historical discrepancies in credit issuance, prioritising transparency and the long-term sustainability of the project.\n\nWe value Verras role in trying to advance environmental integrity and looks forward to constructive dialogue as we move forward.\n\nCGI remains committed to the Kariba REDD+ Projects mission of forest conservation and community support in Zimbabwe. We are grateful for Verras input and are committed to continue working towards resolutions that uphold the highest standards, the company said.\n\nAmidst the positive outlook, GCI issued a weeks ultimatum demanding from Verra the baseline assessment report and data sources for the Kariba REDD+ Project review.\n\nWhile we appreciate the update on the carbon accounting and quality control processes, we are concerned by the lack of accompanying detail regards the basis for the reported findings, wrote CGI in a note dated September 25, 2025.\n\nAs the project proponent, we are committed to engaging constructively and transparently with all stakeholders involved, the company further said, before demanding the baseline reassessment report and data sources.\n\nFurther, GCI requested a freeze on the compensation process and interfering with its clients without the companys prior consent.\n\nThe ultimatum comes in the wake of concerns by Verra that there was over-crediting of carbons for the Kariba REDD+ Project, which some environmental analysts have questioned.\n\nIn an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Phillip Mutemachani said Verra was shooting itself in the foot by stating alleged over-crediting Kariba REDD+ Project carbon credits.\n\nMeanwhile, carbon asset developer, South Pole, has also added its voice on the saga of Verras Section 6 review into the Kariba REDD+ Project.\n\nAlthough South Pole has ceased all involvement with both project and the project owner since 2023, we have cooperated with Verra, a global carbon standard body, through every step of this review, which we see as an important process to give everyone, including South Pole and its various stakeholders, more clarity and guidance on the projects status and future.\n\nThe integrity and robustness of the buffer pool mechanism remain intact to manage any potential emissions reversals in the project.\n\nIn its past role as carbon asset developer, South Pole has consistently applied Verras VM0009 methodology as it pertains to carbon accounting, South Pole noted in a statement.\n\nIn normal circumstances under Verras VM009 methodology, any discrepancy between projected and actual deforestation (i.e. after a periodic assessment of the baseline as outlined in the methodology itself), would be corrected in subsequent verification periods.\n\nHowever, given the unprecedented situation of the project withdrawing from the Verra Registry, there are no subsequent monitoring periods where such compensation could occur. Verras update confirms that the carbon standard body is now taking proactive, corrective steps to balance credit issuances in lieu of the correction that would have otherwise been applicable as per the in-built true-up mechanism in VM0009.\n\nAlongside South Poles wider cooperation as part of the review, South Pole has proactively requested that Verra cancel the 2.5 million verified Kariba REDD+ credits South Pole holds to help address the discrepancies in issued credits and uphold the environmental integrity of the project.\n\nThis contribution builds on South Poles concerted efforts over the last two years to undergo a comprehensive transformation, which included a full review and strengthening of the companys quality, risk, and compliance protocols. The company introduced stricter KYC and partner diligence processes to ensure project partners align with our ethical and compliance standards.\n\nAs a carbon asset developer hired by the project owner, South Poles past responsibility was to ensure that Verras VM0009 methodology was being consistently applied as it pertains to the carbon accounting of the project, in order to receive verified carbon credits.\n\nIn addition, it managed the sale of carbon credits to the market in order to secure funding for the projects operations on the ground, but responsibility for operating the project on the ground  including engagement with and distribution of funds to local communities and initiatives  has been with CGIs local partner Carbon Green Africa (CGA).\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has dismissed with costs a US$108,766 damages claim filed by 83-year-old farmer Cleopas Matenga against motorist Amanda Zietsman, ruling that the plaintiff failed to prove negligence and that his own testimony undermined his case.\n\nJustice Joel Mambara granted Zietsmans application for absolution from the instance at the close of Matengas case, saying the plaintiff pleaded one thing and proved another, leaving the court with no coherent cause of action.The plaintiffs evidence is so defective and self-defeating that it has not established a prima facie case of negligence against the defendant, Justice Mambara said in his judgment delivered on September 8, 2025.By his own admissions and his witnesses concessions, his claim became untenable.The claim stemmed from a road traffic accident on September 10, 2023, along the HarareChirundu highway near the Magunje turn-off. Matenga, then 82, attempted to cross the highway to meet his brother at a bus stop when he was struck by Zietsmans vehicle.He later issued summons in September 2024 seeking over US$43,000 in medical expenses, US$5,000 in future treatment costs, and US$55,000 in general damages for loss of earnings and amenities. Matenga argued that the accident was caused solely by Zietsmans negligence.Zietsman denied liability, insisting she had exercised reasonable care by keeping a lookout, hooting, and braking when Matenga suddenly dashed onto the road.During trial, Matenga admitted he neither saw the approaching car nor heard the horn. He also conceded that all his medical expenses were paid by his brother, and he produced no proof of earnings to support his damages claim.The police officer, who attended the scene, confirmed visibility was good and acknowledged the plaintiff had created a sudden emergency for the driver.The plaintiffs conceded he contributed to the accident, although he sought to apportion greater blame to the driver.Mambara noted this left the plaintiffs case self-destructive.The plaintiff pleaded exclusive fault by the defendant but proved contributory negligence on his own part. The law does not permit the court to make a finding of contributory negligence out of the blue when it was never pleaded, the judge said.He added that the damages claim also failed.The plaintiff failed to provide the conclusive evidence necessary to sustain a claim for damages. A court cannot embark upon conjecture where there is no factual basis.The High Court found that Zietsman had acted as a reasonable driver under the circumstances and that no evidence of speeding, lack of lookout, or negligence was established.Matengas entire claim was dismissed, and he was ordered to pay costs.Justice is served by terminating the case at this juncture, Mambara ruled.\n\nJustice Joel Mambara granted Zietsmans application for absolution from the instance at the close of Matengas case, saying the plaintiff pleaded one thing and proved another, leaving the court with no coherent cause of action.\n\nThe plaintiffs evidence is so defective and self-defeating that it has not established a prima facie case of negligence against the defendant, Justice Mambara said in his judgment delivered on September 8, 2025.By his own admissions and his witnesses concessions, his claim became untenable.The claim stemmed from a road traffic accident on September 10, 2023, along the HarareChirundu highway near the Magunje turn-off.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has ruled that Simbisa Brands Zimbabwe, the operator of Chicken Inn, Pizza Inn and other fast-food outlets, infringed music copyrights by playing songs without a valid licence from the Zimbabwe Music Rights Association (ZIMURA), but escaped paying nearly US$87,000 in claimed damages after the court found the figure ill-conceived.\n\nJustice Jacob Mafusire delivered the ruling on September 10, 2025, in a case that pitched two rival collecting societies  ZIMURA and the Zimbabwe Council of Copyright Owners (Zimcoco)  against one another, while testing the scope of Zimbabwes Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act.The first defendant violated the copyright in the musical works played at its outlets, Justice Mafusire ruled.Such copyright had been assigned to the plaintiff. It was the plaintiff which had the exclusive right to do what the owner of a copyright is permitted to do in terms of the Act.ZIMURA sued Simbisa Brands for royalties covering November 2023 to October 2024, accusing it of using music by its members  including almost all of Zimbabwes best-known musicians such as Alick Macheso, Jah Prayzah, Nutty O, Winky D, and the late Oliver Mtukudzi  without paying fees. ZIMURA argued that even foreign artists under the CISAC global agreement were affected.The association demanded US$86,719, equivalent to its annual licence fees for Simbisa outlets, and sought a declaration that Zimcoco had no authority to licence songs from ZIMURAs stable.Simbisa countered that it had already paid royalties to Zimcoco, a rival collecting society registered in 2019, and had been assured by the Ministry of Justices Copyright Office that this was sufficient.Zimcoco, for its part, argued it was equally entitled to licence music users, and had lawfully licensed Simbisa.Justice Mafusire dismissed Zimcocos stance, saying registration as a collecting society does not give blanket authority.The issue is not about being registered as a collecting society. It is about who has the copyright in the music played for public consumption, the judge wrote.The second defendant cannot possibly authorise any person to play music that is protected by copyright.However, the court rejected ZIMURAs damages claim, finding that it had simply equated lost royalties to the value of its annual licence without proving actual prejudice suffered by its members.The plaintiffs computation of the amount of its claim and the quantum thereto are ill-conceived, Justice Mafusire said.Works of music by different artists cannot possibly have the same value The quantum bears no relationship to the prejudice allegedly suffered.The court ruled that Zimcoco (the second defendant) cannot authorise anyone to play music protected by copyright.Mafusire also said Simbisa Brands was absolved from the damages claim and also that Zimcoco must pay ZIMURAs costs, while Simbisa and ZIMURA will each bear their own costs.\n\nJustice Jacob Mafusire delivered the ruling on September 10, 2025, in a case that pitched two rival collecting societies  ZIMURA and the Zimbabwe Council of Copyright Owners (Zimcoco)  against one another, while testing the scope of Zimbabwes Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act.\n\nThe first defendant violated the copyright in the musical works played at its outlets, Justice Mafusire ruled.Such copyright had been assigned to the plaintiff.
