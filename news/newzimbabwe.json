            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nZimbabwes pensions sector has demonstrated resilient growth in the first half of 2025, according to the latest report released by the Insurance and Pensions Commission (IPEC).\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, the sectors total assets stood at US$2.63 billion (ZWG70.76 billion), reflecting a 6% increase from US$2.48 billion recorded at the end of March 2025.\n\nThis growth, largely driven by new investments, member contributions, and favourable adjustments in the value of investment properties and equity, signals positive movement for the sector. However, challenges persist, particularly concerning pension contribution arrears and a large proportion of inactive funds, said IPEC.\n\nDespite operating under a relatively stable exchange rate environment, the sectors total income fell sharply by 78.74% to US$295.47 million (ZWG7.87 billion) for the six months to June 2025, down from US$1.39 billion recorded during the same period in 2024.\n\nIPEC attributed the decline to reduced fair value gains, which had previously been buoyed by exchange rate movements.\n\nInvestment performance varied across asset classes. Investment properties, which form a major component of pension fund portfolios, recorded modest growth of 1.75%, increasing to US$1.16 billion (ZWG31.14 billion) from US$1.14 billion in March.\n\nUnquoted equity investments rose by 3% to US$108.17 million, up from US$105.06 million, while quoted equity investments declined by 1.11%, falling to US$460.37 million from US$465.56 million.\n\nPrescribed asset investments, which fund government securities, also dipped by 2%, decreasing to US$274 million (ZWG7.38 billion) from US$280 million, reflecting a more cautious investment stance amid ongoing economic uncertainty.\n\n",

Its a big problem that needs to get real attention, said Munetsi.\n\nWhile there are no official statistics on the number of players defrauded by bogus agents, FIFPro has intensified awareness campaigns across Africa to help players identify legitimate representation and avoid exploitation.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZanu PFs internal power struggles have escalated dramatically, with party spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa publicly rebuking Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, accusing him of turning the presidium into a kangaroo court.\n\nThe confrontation reportedly followed Chiwengas demand for President Emmerson Mnangagwa to take action against individuals named in a corruption dossier he presented to the Politburo.\n\nSources told NewZimbabwe.com tensions were high during the meeting. Chiwengas allies initially rallied behind him before retreating when questions were raised about the motives behind his dossier.\n\nThe document reportedly implicates several prominent businessmen closely associated with Mnangagwa, including Wicknell Chivayo, Delish Nguwaya, Kudakwashe Tagwirei, Pedzai Sakupwanya, and Paul Tungwarara.\n\nThe group is accused of siphoning millions from state coffers, calling for their immediate arrest,a move that has deepened divisions within the ruling party.\n\nOur Vice President decides to turn the Presidium into a kangaroo court. An inquisitive court.KutongaPresident citing that document which was authored by Kasukuwere and his colleagues, Mutsvangwa told journalists at a press briefing in Harare, Thursday, expressing his disapproval of Chiwengas actions.\n\nMutsvangwa claimed that everyone in the Politburo professed ignorance about the origins of the dossier, with the exception of Chiwengaleading to speculation that the Vice President is acting alone.\n\nHefurther suggested that the incident had served as a reminder to Chiwenga that he is merely a Presidential appointee and lacks independent powerandshould conduct himself accordingly.\n\nIt reminded the Presidium that you are appointees of the President like us. You have no powers as the Presidium. And it was one person among these Presidium members who was championing that document. All these other people were just being dragged along.\n\nThe Politburo asked who penned the document, do you accept the ownership individually? All other members of the Presidium said we dont know where it came from. So it zeroed in on the Vice President.\n\nChiwenga has consistentlyslammed corruption, describing it as a national security threat. He has also repeatedly warned those who amass wealth through unscrupulous means to watch their backs, suggesting that their day of reckoning is coming.\n\nThe individuals named in the dossier are alleged to be securing government tenders through corrupt practices. These allegations are not new, but their formal presentation within the Politburo has brought the issue to a head.\n\nFor instance, Chivayo previously defrauded ZESA of US$5 million in the Gwanda Solar Power project through his Intratek Company, and failed to deliver on the project.\n\nTagwirei has been linked to the over US$3 billion Command Agriculture scandal and is also implicated in the recent dossier alleging that approximately US$3.2 billion has been stolen from state coffers. Meanwhile, Paul Tungwarara secured a tender to drill 10,000 boreholes under the Presidential Borehole Drilling Scheme, but was recently criticised by Parliament for failing to deliver.\n\nThe government has acknowledged that it is losing US$2 billion annually due to corruption and illicit financial dealings, making the current accusations all the more damaging and increasing the pressure on Mnangagwa to take action.\n\n",
