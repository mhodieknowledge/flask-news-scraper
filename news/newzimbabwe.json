Gregory Meeks\n\nPresident Mnangagwa swore to strengthen the pillars of Zimbabwes democracy and accept term limits. Extending his term would erode that foundation, said Meeks.\n\nRM@RepGregoryMeeks: President Mnangagwa swore to strengthen the pillars of Zimbabwes democracy and accept term limits. Extending his term would erode that foundation.https://t.co/ETRIY4h7ez\n\n House Foreign Affairs Committee Dems (@HouseForeign)October 22, 2025\n\nAlthough consensus on Mnangagwas term extension is yet to be achieved within the party, a resolution from the partys 2024 National Peoples Conference to amend the constitution to pave the way for it, has been acknowledged.\n\nThe recent conference demanded that the process be set in motion immediately.\n\nMnangagwa had in the past distanced himself from supporters who were calling on him to hang on to power.\n\nI will persuade the persuaders not to persuade me, he told editors at a meeting he held with them at State House last year.\n\nZanu PF is currently exploring routes by which it can amend two sections of the Zimbabwean constitution without going for a referendum so as to ensure Mnangagwas stay.\n\nThe two sections giving them headaches are Section 91(2) which sets a two-term limit for the top office and Section 328(7) that says an incumbent cannot benefit from any such amendment.\n\n",

All I can say is that it was about time. We are so ready to show that women can definitely do it too. This platform is not just a performance; it is a statement that women belong at the forefront of our music scene, said Feli Nandi.\n\nThe concert, which is being hosted by Gateway Stream in collaboration with ZAR Events, will be held on 8 November.\n\nTamy Moyo said the concert will debunk industry stereotypes that have seen women playing second fiddle to their male counterparts.\n\nIt is powerful to stand among women who are rewriting the story of creativity. This show celebrates our strength, softness, and individuality. It reminds me that feminine expression deserves to take up space, unapologetically.\n\nMy set is inspired by womanhood. Its strength, vulnerability and rhythm. I want the audience to feel seen, to leave with hearts full and spirits lifted. Every song tells a piece of that shared story.\n\nWomen are no longer waiting for doors to open; we are building new ones. We are redefining leadership, style, and creativity with authenticity and power. The industry feels more honest because of it, said Moyo.\n\n",

Kasondo was Dembares hero last Sunday, scoring the equaliser in their 11 draw against Highlanders at Barbourfields Stadium.\n\nThe semi-final showdown comes as both traditional giants search for redemption following inconsistent league performances that have left them hovering near the lower half of the table.\n\nHead-to-head in league competitions, Dynamos have not beaten Highlanders in open play since 2015, adding extra pressure ahead of Sundays clash.\n\nHowever, Dembare have already made history by becoming the first team to reach the Chibuku Super Cup semi-finals for three consecutive seasons, a feat they will be hoping to build on despite the absence of two key players.\n\n",
