This is a pivotal moment for our farmers, who have waited long for formal recognition of their land rights, Masuka said.\n\nAgriculture Minister Anxious Masuka\n\nHe revealed that around 360,000 Model A1 farmers and 24,000 Model A2 farmers stand to benefit. However, he admitted that logistical challenges remain. Of the 24,000 Model A2 farmers, only about 12,000 have surveyed units ready for processing, with the remainder requiring surveying  a major bottleneck in the process.\n\nTo address this, Masuka said government had engaged the private sector to speed up surveying using modern technology. He also announced the establishment of a one-stop centre at Makombe Complex to streamline title deed processing.\n\nThe centre operates with seven workstations, covering everything from verifying tenure documents to finalising agreements for title deeds, he explained.\n\nOn financing, Masuka said farmers would have several options, including cash purchase, credit facilities, and mortgage arrangements through local banks. To incentivise quick payments, a 15% discount will be offered for cash transactions made within 90 days.\n\nDespite these measures, Masuka acknowledged ongoing challenges, particularly with land surveys and bureaucratic delays, but pledged that government remains committed to ensuring all qualifying farmers receive their title deeds within the set timeframe.\n\n",

What I request is that the Hon. Member should bring the paperwork which talks about the prevalence of homicide cases.\n\nIf we respond to such a question without evidence that this is happening, this is an issue which does not augur well, said Ziyambi.\n\nIn recent months, the country has been witnessing murder cases related to gun violence. They have been attributed to the proliferation and ownership of guns by individuals.\n\nIn May this year, the Zimbabwe Republic Police raised concern about the increase in illegal firearms, which is in contravention of the Firearms Act Chapter 10.09.\n\nZiyambi further said the government does not tolerate homicide cases.\n\nGovernment does not want to see homicide cases happening because it is a criminal offence. It is one offence which had a capital punishment life in jail. In the past, it used a death sentence which was given to an offender.\n\nSo, when we look at the issues to do with homicide, you would find that when criminals hear that there are punitive penalties that have been given to perpetrators of homicide, then this would discourage others.\n\nI want to urge the Hon. Member to put in writing his question so that we get clarity and that we also clarify, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nEcoCash, Zimbabwes largest financial technology platform, says it is stepping up efforts to increase international remittance receipts by partnering with more global payment platforms.\n\nThe mobile money service, owned by Econet Wireless Zimbabwe, already partners with leading global remittance providers such as Sasai Money Transfer, Western Union, WorldRemit, MamaMoney, MoneyGram, Remitly, Shoprite Send and Terrapay.\n\nEcoCash currently has over 40 partners integrating into mobile wallets. The company revealed that it is currently in talks with additional international partners as part of its long-term strategy to build a truly global payments ecosystem.\n\nEfforts to onboard more payment partners are ongoing as we aim to establish a global platform that prioritises convenience, affordability and value for customers, EcoCash said last week at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Zimbabwe (ICAZ) Winter School 2025 and Investment Conference in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe high-profile gathering is positioning Zimbabwe as an emerging investment hub and showcasing the countrys deal pipeline, growth-ready sectors and capital opportunities.\n\nIt is also connecting institutional investors, global financiers and the diaspora with pathways to channel funds into productive ventures.\n\nThe initiative by EcoCash comes at a time when remittances are increasingly playing a vital role in Zimbabwes economy.\n\nAccording to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), diaspora remittances surpassed US$2 billion in 2024, making them one of the countrys largest and most stable sources of foreign currency.\n\nAnalysts say EcoCashs expanded global footprint is timely and strategic, enabling millions of Zimbabweans abroad to send money home faster, more securely, and at a lower cost. EcoCash zero-rates all remittance withdrawals  or cash-outs  from its wallets. It has an extensive distribution network of over 60,000 merchants and channel partners across the countrys rural and urban areas.\n\nIn 2024, EcoCash recorded a 21% growth in transaction volumes and a 210% surge in transaction values, driven by increased wallet funding and growing customer adoption.\n\nThe growth reflects consumer trust in the mobile money platform and the increasing importance of digital channels in cross-border money transfers.\n\nBeyond household support for essentials  such as food, school fees, healthcare, and housing  remittances are increasingly powering small business growth and community development projects, EcoCash said, noting that reliable and affordable digital payment services are enabling both rural and urban recipients to transact, save and invest without relying on costly cash-based methods.\n\nIndustry experts observe that strengthening formal remittance channels curb dependence on informal networks, improves financial inclusion and enhances consumer protection.\n\nWith Zimbabwes diaspora spread across South Africa, the UK, the US, Australia and beyond, EcoCashs expansion of its partner network offers more convenience and consolidates its market leadership in the mobile money space.\n\nAs we expand, our mission remains clear  to empower Zimbabweans abroad to conveniently support their loved ones with ease, while ensuring that recipients at home enjoy safe, transparent and seamless access to funds for both their everyday needs and future investments.\n\nRemitHope  a fintech-powered social enterprise that mobilises financial support for underfunded African-led community initiatives and leverages EcoCash to channel remittances into Africa to close the funding gaps  also participated at the ICAZ Winter School 2025 and Investment Conference in the UK.\n\n",
