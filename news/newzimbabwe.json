Tuesdays match was the first time the Young Warriors found the back of the net, with Tadiwa Chakuchichi scoring, while the second came via an own goal.\n\nAfter the defeat, coach Thulani Sibanda did not mince his words, laying the blame squarely on his players.\n\nYou saw the games and the three goals we conceded during the tournament, even social football players could have defended those.\n\nThe truth is, we were discovering some of these players here, and I cant run away from that fact.\n\nZimbabwe had reached the semifinals last year, but their failure this year highlights the gulf in quality. The country last won the COSAFA U-17 tournament in 2007.\n\nMeanwhile, in the other Group A fixture, Mozambique thrashed Eswatini 4-0 to secure progression.\n\nFinal Group A standings:\n\nMozambique  7 points\n\nComoros  7 points\n\nZimbabwe  1 point\n\nEswatini  1 point\n\n",

The source of his funds is once again under intense scrutiny.\n\nDespite persistent questions about the origin of his wealth, the self-proclaimed supporter of the ruling Zanu PF party recently lavished new cars on all ten Provincial Chairpersons, prompting renewed calls for transparency.\n\nChivayo stated that the expensive gifts were to celebrate President Emmerson Mnangagwas birthday.\n\nEach Provincial Chairperson received a brand new 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 300 series VXR, valued at approximately US$190,000.\n\nIn a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Monday, Chivayo apologised to the Zanu PF Provincial leadership for the delayed token of appreciation.\n\nMy apologies for not having done something sooner, especially following Zanu PFs resounding victory in the 2023 harmonised elections, he wrote.\n\nAs a small token of appreciation, I extend a big CONGRATULATIONS to ALL TEN Provincial Chairpersons, FARAI from Faramatsi Motors located at Club Chambers showroom, Cnr 3rd Street and Nelson Mandela, has supplied your BRAND NEW 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 300 series VXR, valued at $190,000 each, FULLY PAID for and now ready for collection.\n\nHONOURING AND CELEBRATING OUR UNSUNG HEROES ON MUNHUMUTAPA DAYE.D@83\n\nOne of the most exceptional attributes of ZANU PF as a REVOLUTIONARY party is its UNSHAKEABLE foundation that is built on UNITY, development and empowerment. The party has a clear and systematic STRUCTUREpic.twitter.com/qUYX8CntZu\n\n sir_wicknell. (@wicknellchivayo)September 15, 2025\n\nThe businessman also gifted each provincial chairperson US$100,000 in cash, earmarked for development projects in their respective areas.\n\nIn addition to this personal vehicle, each Chairperson will receive a small token of $100,000 in cash for them to support small development and empowerment initiatives in their respective Provinces.\n\nVice President Constantino Chiwenga has indirectly criticised individuals who accumulate wealth through dishonest means, describing them as fundamentally corrupt. He used the vernacular term zvigananda to characterise them.\n\nMnangagwa, on the other hand, has previously described Chivayo as a philanthropist, stating that he could not dictate how Chivayo spends his money.\n\nThis apparent difference in opinion highlights a potential rift between Mnangagwa and his deputy regarding Chivayos business dealings and public displays of wealth.\n\nChivayo, whose philanthropic claims have been met with scepticism, also donated ten Land Cruisers, valued at US$90,000 each, to government hospitals across the country.\n\nThen lastly I am also very pleased to donate 10 brand-new top of the range , state of the art TOYOTA LANDCRUISER (ICU) AMBULANCE valued at USD 90 000 which i kindly and respectfully request should be handed over to the government GENERAL HOSPITAL in each Provincial Capital in honour of President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwas 82nd birthday.\n\nWhile some Zimbabweans have praised Chivayos ambulance donation as a charitable act, others continue to view him with suspicion, portraying him as a thief and a fraudster.\n\n",
