            "content": "Al Jazeera\n\nFormer United States President Joe Bidens cancer diagnosis has rekindled questions about whether he deceived the public about his health while in office, with his successor, Donald Trump, adding his voice to those suggesting a cover-up.\n\nSpeaking to reporters at the White House on Monday, President Trump cast doubt on the timing of Bidens advanced cancer diagnosis amid renewed scrutiny of the former presidents physical and mental fitness during his tenure.\n\nIm surprised that the public wasnt notified a long time ago, Trump told reporters at the White House.\n\nWhy did it take so long? This takes a long time. It can take years to get this level of danger, Trump added, referring to the advanced nature of Bidens cancer.\n\nSo, look, its a very sad situation, I feel very badly about it. And I think people should try and find out what happened.\n\nTrump also said that doctors who had examined Biden while in office were not telling the facts.\n\nThats a big problem, he said.\n\nBidens office said in a statement on Sunday that the former president was diagnosed with an aggressive form of prostate cancer that had spread to his bones.\n\nThe statement said Biden was diagnosed on Friday after experiencing increasing urinary symptoms and that he and his family were reviewing treatment options.\n\nDoctors graded Bidens cancer with a score of 9 under the Gleason classification system  which typically classifies prostate cancer between 6 and 10  according to the statement, indicating it is among the most aggressive kinds.\n\nLate-stage prostate cancer has an average five-year survival rate of 28 percent, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine.\n\nBiden earlier on Monday expressed gratitude to well-wishers for their words of support and encouragement.\n\nCancer touches us all, Biden wrote on social media.\n\nLike so many of you, Jill and I have learned that we are strongest in the broken places. Thank you for lifting us up with love and support.\n\nThe news of Bidens cancer diagnosis came as the former presidents health was already under renewed scrutiny ahead of the publication of a new book detailing the alleged cover-up of his physical and mental deterioration by his inner circle.\n\nOriginal Sin, written by CNN anchor Jake Tapper and Axios correspondent Alex Thompson, contains various damning accounts of Bidens alleged decline, including an incident in which the then-president was reportedly unable to recognise Hollywood actor George Clooney at a 2024 fundraiser.\n\nIn his comments on Bidens diagnosis on Monday, Trump drew a link between the former presidents cancer and the alleged concealment of his mental acuity.\n\nIf you take a look, its the same doctor that said Joe was cognitively fine, there was nothing wrong with him, Trump said.\n\nThere are things going on that the public wasnt informed of, and I think somebody is going to have to speak to his doctor, he added.\n\nSome doctors have publicly questioned the account of Bidens cancer diagnosis provided by his office, pointing out that such advanced cancer would have had to progress over a period of years.\n\nFor even with the most aggressive form, it is a 5-7 year journey without treatment before it becomes metastatic, Steven Quay, a pathologist who is the chief executive of biopharmaceuticalcompanyAtossa Therapeutics, said in a post on X.\n\nMeaning, it would be malpractice for this patient to show up and be first diagnosed with metastatic disease in May 2025. It is highly likely he was carrying a diagnosis of prostate cancer throughout his White House tenure and the American people were uninformed.\n\nHoward P Forman, a professor of radiology at Yale University, said it was inconceivable that Bidens cancer was not detected before he left office, as it would have been picked up by a blood test known as a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test.\n\nGleason grade 9 would have had an elevated PSA level for some time before this diagnosis. And he must have had a PSA test numerous times before. This is odd, Forman said in a post on X.\n\nHowever, Peter Nelson, an oncologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, said it is possible for prostate cancer to develop and spread rapidly in a short period of time, though it is more common for it to remain localised without detection for years before progressing to other parts of the body.\n\nIt is possible for prostate cancer to develop and then spread in a very short time span  by short, within one to two years, Nelson told Al Jazeera.\n\nSo, yes, it is credible that a man of his age and position could have his cancer develop and progress without detection. This would not be common, but definitely happens, Nelson said.\n\nDaniel W Lin, a prostate cancer expert at UW Medicine in Washington state, said that while Biden has very likely had cancer for years, it is possible he was not given a PSA test.\n\nThere are screening controversies with the use of PSA, and many medical groups do not recommend PSA testing after 70 or 75 years of age, although others recommend based on life expectancy or state of health rather than age cut-points, Lin told Al Jazeera.\n\nLin said it was also possible that Biden has a rarer form of cancer that is not detectable by the test.\n\nThis situation is less common, but not considered overly rare. Additionally, when this situation occurs, it is more common in high-grade cancers, such as former President Bidens case, he said.\n\nPlaying the odds, he does not fall into this category, however, it can definitely occur.\n\nPeter Black, director of the Vancouver Prostate Centre in Canada, said Bidens cancer going undetected in tests would be his best guess for the apparently sudden diagnosis.\n\nMy best guess is that he has had a PSA done every year for a long time because that is what you would expect for a US senator/vice president/president, and that he actually has an age-appropriate PSA that did not raise any alarms, Black told Al Jazeera.\n\nA diagnosis of metastatic prostate cancer is usually associated with a very high PSA, but in a small minority of patients, the PSA is actually normal, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "When it comes toonline pokies, players often find themselves debating between RNG (Random Number Generator) games and live dealer options. For players at Lucky Green Casino, a platform tailored for New Zealand players, this decision is crucial, as both gaming experiences offer different benefits and levels of trustworthiness. Lets explore the differences in these two types of experiences and determine which one feels more reliable at Lucky Green Casino.\n\nRNG games at Lucky Green Casino rely on advanced algorithms to create random outcomes for each spin, card draw, or dice roll. These games dont involve human dealers but instead use mathematical models to ensure fairness and unpredictability. For many players, RNG games are appealing because they offer fast-paced gaming without any human interaction.\n\nWhat makes RNG games trustworthy at Lucky Green Casino is their use of encryption technologies to protect player data. Every game result is generated in real-time, ensuring fairness and integrity. While some may wonder whether these games are rigged, the fact remains that RNG systems are regularly tested and certified by independent auditing companies. Although Lucky Green Casino does not specify which third-party auditors they work with, top casinos in the industry adhere to industry standards for RNG certification.\n\nIn contrast to RNG games, live dealer games bring the thrill of a real casino directly to your screen. These games, powered by live streaming technology, are hosted by professional dealers who interact with players in real time. Whether youre playing blackjack, roulette, or baccarat, live dealer games at Lucky Green Casino are designed to replicate the atmosphere of a brick-and-mortar casino, providing an authentic experience.\n\nThe main advantage of live dealer games is transparency. Players can see the dealer shuffle cards, spin the roulette wheel, or deal the poker hands, which provides a higher level of trust. The results are determined by physical actions, not algorithms, which many players find reassuring. However, its important to note that Lucky Green Casino does not yet offer live dealer games. Players who prefer this type of experience will need to seek out other platforms for now.\n\nIn terms of trustworthiness, both RNG and live dealer games offer different types of assurance. RNG games at Lucky Green Casino are statistically proven to be fair, given they are certified by independent auditing bodies. The randomness of the outcomes is underpinned by the technology, ensuring a level playing field for all players. Many enjoy RNG games for their speed, consistency, and absence of human error.\n\nOn the other hand, live dealer games provide a more transparent and visually engaging experience. Watching a real dealer in action gives some players the peace of mind they seek, as they can directly witness the outcome of every spin or shuffle. However, since live dealer games are not available at Lucky Green Casino, RNG games are the primary option for players who want to enjoy their gaming experience here.\n\nLucky Green Casino offers a fantastic range of bonuses designed to give both new and existing players a great start. Heres a breakdown of the impressive bonuses available:\n\nTerms:\n\nWith such generous bonuses spread across your first five deposits, Lucky Green Casino makes it easy to boost your bankroll and enjoy their diverse range of games! \n\nLucky Green Casino boasts over 1,000 games to keep players entertained. Heres a glimpse at some of the exciting game categories available:\n\nNo matter your preferences, Lucky Green Casino has a game for you to enjoy!\n\nThe official website of Lucky Green Casino is mobile-responsive, meaning you can easily navigate the platform on both desktop and mobile devices. With a sleek, user-friendly design, the website provides easy access to games, promotions, and account management. Whether youre new to online casinos or an experienced player, the sites layout ensures that you can quickly find what youre looking for.\n\nLucky Green Casino provides customer support through live chat and email at support@luckygreen.com. While reviews suggest some variability in response times, the support team is generally available during limited hours. Be sure to reach out to them if you need assistance, though be prepared for potential wait times.\n\nThe minimum deposit is NZ$2025, depending on your payment method.\n\nYes, the casinos website is optimized for mobile play, so you can enjoy games on both Android and iOS devices.\n\nYes, the casino uses SSL encryption to protect your personal data and transactions. However, it operates under a Curaao license, which may be less stringent than some other jurisdictions.\n\nWithdrawal times can vary, but bank transfers typically take 24-48 hours, while crypto withdrawals tend to be faster.\n\nCurrently, Lucky Green Casino does not offer live dealer games, but it provides a broad selection of RNG-based games.\n\n",

            "content": "The Guardian\n\nTwenty-two years is a long time, even in a sport that measures its games in days and its history in centuries. The last time England played a Test match against Zimbabwe, in 2003, Rob Key was in the middle order instead of the managing directors job, Jimmy Anderson was a 20-year-old tearaway playing in his very first series, and the England and WalesCricketBoard was just about to launch the worlds very first professional Twenty20 tournament. Zimbabwean cricket has changed, too. Back then the team was in the earliest stages of a transformation that was meant to turn cricket from a minority game, played by the small white population, into a sport that better represented the whole country.\n\nThey have been hard years, riven by player strikes, political interference, maladministration and a miserable drop-off in results. The team temporarily withdrew from Test cricket, suspended their domestic competition and were repeatedly censured by the International Cricket Council. They lost so many players through emigration to England, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand, that even now you could build a hell of a good Zimbabwean squad out of people who are making a living overseas. And yet, at the end of it all, the process was, by one important measure, a success. The squad that came on tour in 2003 was majority white, the team that has come this year is majority black.\n\nDespite all the politics, despite all the chaos that weve been through, cricket is now a national game, says David Coltart, supported by an overwhelming majority of Zimbabweans, black and white and other races. Coltart is the elected mayor of Bulawayo, a white man elected in a mostly black city. He has spent his life navigating the bitter, heated, complicated politics of his country. He has been fighting for the Zimbabwe he believes in ever since the 1990s, first as a founding member of the Movement for Democratic Change and a key figure in the opposition to Robert Mugabe, then as minister for education and sport in Morgan Tsvangirais coalition government.\n\nMore than five million people have emigrated from the country in that time. Coltart is one of the ones who stayed. I believe in Zimbabwe with a passion, he says, I believe in its people and its future, and I believe it is a country worth fighting for.\n\nWhen Andy Flower and Henry Olonga made their public protest against the death of democracy in their country in 2003, it was Coltart they asked to help draft their statement. My sadness is that Henry and Andy didnt stay in the country, he says, because they remain hugely influential figures. Its not a criticism. I understand why they felt compelled to leave. But we need figures like them. He mourns Heath Streak, who did stay, butwho died in 2023. Heath provided inspiration to people on both sides of the argument. He was a white man who was fluent in Ndebele, and who attracted a lot of sympathy and affection from a lot of black people, and yet he remained an inspirational people for white farmers whod been dispossessed of their land.\n\nFor Coltart, the Zimbabwean team is emblematic of the society it represents. We punch above our weight. Which is why he believes transformation had to happen.\n\nIt was very necessary, Coltart says. Cricket in Zimbabwe 30 years ago was a minority sport. If you just looked at the crowds they were, relatively speaking, very few black people in them. Even aside from the principle of the matter, that situation was completely unsustainable. He just wishes it had been done differently. He makes a comparison with the redistribution of land, and the violent farm takeovers which were the cause of so much pain, grief and injustice in the 2000s. The land holdings were unjust, he says, But we could have done it without violence. Now, there wasnt violence in cricket, but I think that when you look at the dreadful collapse of cricket in 2004, that could have been avoided.\n\nWhen Zimbabwe stopped playing Test cricket, Coltart helped lead the campaign to restore it. In government he spent a lot of time lobbying the English to start playing fixtures against his country again. The ECB turned its back on the country, even after the end of the Mugabe regime. It was only when Richard Gould took over as the chief executive of the ECB that things finally changed. They disregarded us and while I understand the reasons, Ive never felt that England should not be playing Zimbabwe, Coltart says. Although Im a strident critic of the Zimbabwean regime, Ive always believed in the power of sport to bridge divides.\n\nEven now, he would be against a boycott of Afghan cricket on similar grounds. Because if the players and the board members themselves are trying to do the right thing but are being constrained by the government, then youve got to support them and encourage them, not boycott them. Use the game, the opportunities it provides, to build relations, and to hold them to higher standards.\n\nHe is still trying to do that in his own country now, as mayor. Bulawayo has just won the right to host theStreet Child Cricket World Cup. But Coltart is deeply concerned about the way the sport is being run. Theres still far too much politics involved in Zimbabwe Cricket, in the running of the organisation, and even in the selection policies. I still fear that were not spending the money that we get as best we should. Im a politician, but I dont think politicians should be anywhere near cricket administration. I would rather see people whose primary attribute is a great passion for cricket being involved in the running of the sport. Id like to see our best players from the past dominating the selection panel, black and white.\n\nStill, he beams when he thinks that Zimbabwe are going to play a Test at Trent Bridge this week. Despite the politics, despite the abuse of the rule of law and corruption in the country, all the concerns that I have regarding the government, the vast majority of Zimbabweans are united. Its a wonderful country and you will see that in our cricket, we are a passionately multiracial team, and thats a wonderful projection of our country.\n\n",

He then took the skillet with the eggs, tried to hit her, and she fell to the ground, Richard said.\n\nShe said it seemed like Ventura dropped to the ground because she anticipated the hit: She went into the fetal position.\n\nCombs then dragged Ventura upstairs by her hair and with his arm around her neck, Richard said. She recalled hearing glass breaking and yelling from upstairs.\n\nRichard, who worked with Combs from 2004 to 2011, shared that fear prevented her from intervening or contacting authorities at the time.\n\nI was scared to do anything in fear of what that might mean for me, too, she admitted.\n\nRichard testified that the following day, Combs summoned her and another woman who witnessed the incident into a recording studio, where he allegedly dismissed the incident as mere passion, warning them that people go missing if they talk.\n\nRichard, now 42 years old, later filed a lawsuit against Combs, accusing him of sexual battery, harassment and false imprisonment.\n\nAlthough Combss defence team claimed they were unaware of Richards intentions to discuss the skillet incident, prosecutors said that they had informed the defence about it back in March.\n\nThe trial continues with Combs facing serious charges, including sex trafficking, conspiracy racketeering and engaging in prostitution, to which he has pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe trial resumed on Monday, May 19, with Richard expected to continue her testimony.\n\nThe trial, slated to span approximately eight weeks, will hear from more women whose identities will remain anonymous.\n\n",

As of now, some of the linens are tattered, some furniture is broken, and some infrastructure is in dire need of renovations, she added.\n\nShe told the Committee that the current renovations that are being made were from the little funds from the dilapidated infrastructure.\n\nIt is important to take note that 2019 occupancy is higher than 2024, whilst the 2024 arrivals are higher than 2019.\n\nThis substantiates the fact that the market is slowly neglecting the Zimparks accommodation, and this is mainly due to the state of the product, said Chitsaka.\n\nChitsaka highlighted that the regulatory framework was not in order, as the Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (PRAZ) framework posed operational challenges for Small Business Units (SBUs) within National Parks, such as Tshabalala Refreshment Centre, the Kariba Refreshment Centre, the Zambezi Rock Pool, and Rhodes Nyanga Hotel.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nThis story contains details that some people may find distressing.\n\nThe most shocking thing for Jonathan, who had endured six gruelling months living and working underground in an abandoned South African gold mine, was the abuse he witnessed being meted out to children.\n\nSome are recruited for cheap labour, but others are brought in specifically for sex, campaigners say.\n\nJonathan, now in his late 20s, had migrated to South Africa from a nearby country on the promise of making easy money working in one of its dozens of disused mines, closed by multinationals because they were no longer commercially viable.\n\nWe are protecting his full identity as he fears reprisals from the vicious criminal gangs that run the illegal mining industry for speaking to the media.\n\nDetails of what the young people were going through emerged after the death of dozens of illegal miners near the town of Stilfontein late last year when the mine was blockaded by police.\n\nIn a calm and steady voice, Jonathan describes the heat, long hours and limited food and sleeping options which took a toll on his body.\n\nBut an enduring memory is what happened to the underage miners in the shaft where he worked.\n\nI used to see these kids in the mine  teenagers actually, 15, 17-year-olds.\n\nOthers used to take advantage of them sometimes. It was a little bit scary, and I wasnt comfortable with it.\n\nHe said they were raped by adult miners who promised to give them some of the gold they found in exchange for sex.\n\nIf that kid is desperate for money, he will take the risk.\n\nJonathan describes how the children would approach teams of miners for protection but that team would have conditions.\n\nSex was also used as punishment if the teenagers failed to complete a task for their team.\n\nJonathan says the children in the mine where he worked were all foreign and did not realise what they were getting themselves into.\n\nAFP Illegal miners enter abandoned mines through disused shafts, often descending kilometres and not able to leave for months\n\nMining researcher and activist Makhotla Sefuli backs this up.\n\nHe says criminal gangs specifically target children to work in illegal mines across South Africa.\n\nMany of them are abducted from neighbouring countries and trafficked. They are enticed by baseless promises of finding them employment in the formal mining industry.\n\nTheir passports are confiscated when they get to South Africa It is common knowledge that these young boys are being abused, Mr Sefuli says.\n\nThe BBC has spoken to miners who worked in at least two other illegal mines who told us they saw children being abused in the shafts where they were working.\n\nTshepo, not his real name, says he saw older men forcing young boys to have sex with them underground.\n\nIn some instances, they did it for the money. Some are recruited solely for that purpose, because of the financial incentives that will come with the practice of maybe trading sex underground.\n\nHe adds that the abuse deeply affected the children.\n\nThey change their behaviour patterns and have trust issues. They dont want you to get close to them, because they feel that they can no longer trust anyone.\n\nSouth Africas illegal mining industry made global headlines last year following a standoff between police and miners at the Buffelsfontein gold mine, near the town of Stilfontein in the North West Province.\n\nThe authorities had been trying to curb illegal mining, which the government said cost South Africas economy $3.2bn (2.6bn) in lost revenue last year.\n\nThey launched an operation called Vala Umgodi, or seal the hole, in December 2023, promising to take a tough stance on the gangs.\n\nAs part of the operation, the police limited the amount of food and water that went down the Stilfontein mine to, as one minister put it, smoke out the illegal miners. Officials said the men were refusing to come out for fear of being arrested.\n\nSoon footage began to emerge from within the mine showing dozens of emaciated men begging to be rescued, as well as rows of body bags. Eventually a court ordered the authorities to save the men.\n\nAmong those brought up were many who said they were underage, but as a number of them were migrants without documents confirming how old they were, the authorities carried out medical tests to get an estimate.\n\nThrough this, the Department of Social Development (DSD) confirmed that 31 of the rescued Stilfontein miners were found to be children. They were all Mozambicans nationals and in November, 27 of them were repatriated.\n\nSave the Children South Africa helped translate some of the interviews between the underage miners and the rescue workers.\n\nThey went through trauma, because some of them also saw others being sexually exploited, the charitys CEO Gugu Xaba tells the BBC.\n\nJust the feeling that they may not come out of there destroyed those children mentally.\n\nThe adult miners would start by grooming them, by acting like they like them.\n\nShe says the children were then made to perform sexual acts on the adults and they were then raped, days after day.\n\nYou find that the adult will have three or four of them that they are doing the same thing to.\n\nBBC Most children are trafficked in order to be used as sex slaves. And youve got a pimp who is taking the money, Gugu Xaba, CEO, Save the Children South Africa\n\nMs Xaba says mining gangs recruit children because they are easier to manipulate and cheaper.\n\nChildren dont understand when you say: Ill pay you 20 rands ($1; 0.80) per day. The adults sometimes refuse to work, but children find themselves with no choice. So its easier to use a child to do the work. Its easier to take a child whos kind of voiceless and to bring them down there.\n\nBeyond being exploited financially, she says there are gangs that recruit children specifically for sex.\n\nMany illegal miners spend months underground, rarely going up to the surface. Markets spring up underground to provide them with anything they need.\n\nMost children are trafficked in order to be used as sex slaves. And youve got a pimp who is taking the money, and it means every day this child is used as a commercial sex worker.\n\nThe BBC asked the police and the DSD whether anyone would be charged over the sexual abuse allegations. They did not respond to our requests.\n\nA source working on the Stilfontein miners cases said many of the children did not want to testify.\n\nMeanwhile, the illegal mining industry continues to thrive.\n\nAnd with an estimated 6,000 vacant mines potentially available to explore, it is a business that is unlikely to end anytime soon, leaving thousands of vulnerable children at risk.\n\n",
