            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nProphetic Healing and Deliverance Ministries founder, Walter Magaya, and his wife, Tendai, have been remanded in custody until this Tuesday following their appearance in court on fraud charges.\n\nThe couple is jointly charged with their company, Planet Africa, represented by Tendai Chinguwa.\n\nMagaya faces an extra charge of rape.\n\nThe duo appeared before Harare magistrate Marewanazvo Gofa, who is expected to hand down her ruling on their application demanding immediate release on the grounds that they were overdetained.\n\nTheir lawyer, Admire Rubaya, applied for their immediate release, arguing they were detained beyond the 48 hours allowed by law. He also raised complaints against the police.\n\nAccused 1 and 2 (Magaya and wife) were over-detained, said Rubaya. Magaya was arrested at 5am whilst praying in the prayer mountain, praying for everyone in this country. He was arrested by over 30 armed police officers. The accused is a man of God who cannot even harm a fly.\n\nSame applies to second accused, she has just been arrested because she is the wife of the first accused. She was arrested around 5.30am on Saturday. She was supposed to have been released at least by 5.30 am but wasnt. So the accused are here illegally.\n\nRubaya further told the court that the two were held incommunicado. They were not allowed to contact their lawyers. We visited CID Headquarters, where we had been advised they were. We were told they were not there. They were not permitted to contact their lawyers. They were not given access to their lawyers until after 11.30am on November 1, 2025, when one of the police officials who is a lawyer, Julia Chidumwa, contacted the lawyers so that we have access to them. She had to come to where we were at CID Headquarters to take us to the seventh floor, where the accused were being held. So from 5.30 to 11.30, they had no access to their lawyers and those constitutional rights were violated, he said.\n\nRubaya requested to lead Magaya to confirm the time of his arrest.\n\nState representative Clemence Chimbari admitted that the two were overdetained.\n\nRubaya argued that their constitutional rights had been violated. In their mind, they believe it is inconsequential but the Constitution is clear. Even if it is the state, they are obliged to follow the law, he said, adding that an exception could only be made if a court grants a warrant of further detention.\n\nHe said since the state admitted that the two were over-detained, the court should release them unconditionally.\n\nIt is our submission that you cannot put something on nothing. It will collapse. The state is asking you to put the accused on remand notwithstanding over-detention. Its no longer an alleged fact but a fact as confirmed by the state, said Rubaya.\n\nSo the state is coming to you to say we know they were over-detained but we dont care. Place them on remand. That on its own, is unconstitutional. They want to tell us there is a difference between the ZRP and the state.\n\nHe added, The main point we are raising is that the over-detention cannot be inconsequential. The law is clear. The law is bringing the accused after 48 hours. And they concede that it is after 48 hours. This court has jurisdiction to order that the accused persons be released unconditionally. If they want to arrest them after the release, they can do that and we will deal with them then. If they want to proceed by way of summons, they are at liberty to do so. What we are not allowing them is to contaminate the law by applying to place them on remand, yet they were detained beyond 48 hours.\n\nChimbari said there is a remedy.\n\nThe remedy for an infringement of a constitutional right the accused can approach the Constitutional Court for compensation or damages.\n\nChimbari said if the Court allows the immediate release, it will be overstepping its judicial powers.\n\nThe rape case was heard in-camera after the public and journalists were asked to leave.\n\nGofa will hand down her ruling Tuesday morning.\n\n",

            "content": "By Xinhua\n\nTHE upcoming China International Import Expo (CIIE) offers a gateway for Zimbabwean horticultural products to enter the Chinese market, enabling local businesses to directly connect with Chinese buyers and partners, a Zimbabwean exporter has said.\n\nIn a recent interview with Xinhua, Tatenda Mukazi, marketing director of Procitru Investments, a Zimbabwean private company that contracts the growing of fresh produce and other horticultural crops mainly for export, said the CIIE is expected to open new avenues and unlock more growth opportunities for Zimbabwean exports to China.The expo will be held in Shanghai from November 5 to 10. According to Chinas Ministry of Commerce, this years event will feature an expanded special zone for African products, with the number of participating African enterprises increasing by 80 percent year on year.We are going to exhibit blueberries, avocados, avocado oil and macadamia nuts, said Mukazi, who will attend the CIIE for the first time.Zimbabwes blueberries are set to enter the Chinese market following the signing of an export deal during Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwas visit to China in September. A trade protocol on Zimbabwean avocado exports was also signed last September, a move that has excited local farmers eager to access the Chinese market.For this trip, we are going to look for markets, meet buyers and explore machines that can process blueberries into juice for export. We are also looking for partners to do business with, Mukazi said.The expo will also allow him to better understand Chinese market dynamics and systems.I am going to visit their supermarkets and facilities to see how they operate, how they run their systems, and their payment methods, so that we move on the same page, he added.One of Mukazis key goals is to secure direct export agreements with Chinese businesses.I am aiming to meet real buyers so that we can cut off all the middlemen. This is why I am pushing for this trip to be successful, he said.With years of experience in exporting fresh produce, Mukazi works closely with Zimbabwean farmers to identify markets and facilitate exports. He said that the Chinese market represents a significant opportunity for local exporters and that the CIIE serves as a vital bridge connecting Zimbabwean farmers with one of the worlds largest consumer markets.The expo, he added, allows Zimbabwean exporters to showcase a broader range of products beyond the countrys traditional exports such as minerals.Now we are venturing into horticulture, citrus, avocados and berries. For us, it is a great opportunity. We need to show the Chinese market that we are not only buyers; we also have value to offer back home. We can be customers to them, and they can be customers to us, said Mukazi.For us, it is a challenge. We need to up our game and be ready for big deals. It is a new adventure, a new market, and great exposure for us, he added.Beyond opening new export markets, Mukazi sees the CIIE as a platform to deepen partnerships with Chinese companies. As trade with China expands, he said, there is a growing need to work with Chinese partners to increase value addition for local produce such as avocados and blueberries.Already, we have local companies processing avocado oil. On this trip, we are going to bring some samples to market and see how the Chinese market responds, Mukazi said.\n\nIn a recent interview with Xinhua, Tatenda Mukazi, marketing director of Procitru Investments, a Zimbabwean private company that contracts the growing of fresh produce and other horticultural crops mainly for export, said the CIIE is expected to open new avenues and unlock more growth opportunities for Zimbabwean exports to China.\n\nThe expo will be held in Shanghai from November 5 to 10.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe University of Zimbabwes Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences has concluded the medical study of the late Rosalie Chigariro, who in 2021 became the first-ever black Zimbabwean to volunteer her remains for medical research.\n\nHer body was in July 2021 donated to the Department of Biomedical Sciences (Anatomy Unit) for the advancement of medical education, as had always been her wish.\n\nOver the weekend, in a ceremony marked by quiet dignity and gratitude, members of the Anatomy Unit, students, and family members gathered to pay tribute to Chigariro, whose selfless act contributed to the training of hundreds of medical students over four years.\n\nHer generosity gave future doctors invaluable hands-on understanding of the human body, lessons no textbook could ever replace.\n\nIn addition to medical students, paramedics degree programs also benefited from her extraordinary gift. These programs include nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, audiology, speech therapy, and pharmacy, whose students gained essential anatomical knowledge through her donation,\n\nSpeaking at the ceremony, chairperson of the Department of Biomedical Sciences at UZ, Josephine Chidaushe, expressed the universitys deep appreciation for the rare and noble contribution.\n\nThe gift of body donation is one of the most profound forms of service to humanity. Through her selflessness, Ms. Chigariro became a silent teacher, one who helped nurture the next generation of doctors, surgeons, and health professionals, she said.\n\nThough uncommon in African culture, Rosalie made this decision thoughtfully and purposefully. Having battled health challenges since birth  when doctors told her parents she would not live beyond a few months  she grew up understanding both the fragility and the miracle of life. Her choice to donate her body was not one of defiance, but of deep gratitude: a final gift to help others live, learn, and heal.\n\nThere was deep symbolism in her final resting place at Chishawasha Mission, the very grounds where she spent her high school years. Surrounded by faith and learning, it was there she first discovered her sense of purpose  and there, she now rests in peace.\n\nHer family expressed pride in her courage and her lifelong devotion to education and humanity.\n\nWe are deeply proud of her strength and the legacy she leaves behind. Today we say goodbye, not in sorrow, but in gratitude, said her sister, Petronilla.\n\nAmong those whose lives were touched by her legacy was Michelle van der Heiden, a Part Five medical student, who expressed gratitude for the opportunity to learn through Ms. Chigariros gift, describing it as a humbling and transformative experience that will forever shape how we serve patients.\n\nBody donations to the University of Zimbabwes Anatomy Unit play a vital role in advancing medical science, bridging the gap between theory and practice.\n\nHer legacy lives on in the knowledge she inspired, the healers she helped shape, and the lives her courage will continue to touch for years to come.\n\n",
