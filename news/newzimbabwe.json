            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nPreliminary investigations have revealed that a circuit breaker supplying the load tripped, causing a power outage at the new Parliament Building during President Emmerson Mnangagwas State of the Nation Address (SONA), Parliamenthas said.\n\nThe unexpected blackout forced Mnangagwa to complete his address using torchlight before electricity was restored approximately ten minutes later.\n\nThis is the second power outage to occur at the Parliament Building in Mnangagwas presence. The first incident took place during Finance Minister Mthuli Ncubes 2025 National Budget Presentation in November last year, which the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) attributed to natural causes.\n\nDespite prior arrangements to ensure backup power, the latest blackout still occurred, prompting Speaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda to hint at possible sabotage.\n\nMudenda warned that the culprit will regret the day of their existence.\n\nNow in damage control mode, Clerk of Parliament Kennedy Chokuda released a statement explainingthe technical cause of the outage.\n\nThe loss of power supply to key systems occurred when the Parliament Building was running on a generator as the main source of supply, with ZESA power as a standby. When supplies were lost, the generator was still running but not supplying power.\n\nPreliminary investigations indicate that a circuit breaker supplying the load had tripped. The restoration took longer than expected, resulting in part of the SONA being delivered without power, Chokuda said.\n\nParliament said it is working with the Ministry of Local Government, ZESA, and other relevant government agencies to investigate the incident. The findings will be made public once investigations are complete, and measures will be put in place to prevent a recurrence.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa on Tuesday praised the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwes (RBZ) tight monetary policy stance, describing it as favourable for sustaining economic activity and maintaining stability in the economy.\n\nSince taking over as RBZ Governor last year, Dr. John Mushayavanhu has implemented a restrictive monetary policy aimed at anchoring price, currency, and exchange rate stability. The approach involves maintaining a high bank policy rate, currently at 35%,to curb speculative borrowing, which has been a major driver of excess liquidity and illicit parallel market activity.\n\nOther measures, such as elevated reserve requirements, have also been introduced to control inflation while supporting long-term economic growth.\n\nAs a result, the policy has helped sustain the ZWG currency, which has enjoyed nearly a year of relative stability, encouraging broader acceptance and usage.\n\nPresenting the State of the Nation Address (SONA), Mnangagwa credited the RBZs monetary discipline for fostering a favourable economic environment.\n\nThe tight monetary and fiscal environment in the economy has remained favourable to support sustained economic activity. My Government is diligently implementing the necessary policies, measures, and initiatives to maintain the stability of the ZWG and inflation, he said.\n\nThe President added that the ongoing trend of macroeconomic stability is expected to become a permanent feature of Zimbabwes economy.\n\nHe also highlighted significant progress in the countrys foreign currency generation capacity.\n\nInflows stood at US$10.4 billion as of August 2025, an increase of 26.8% from the US$8.3 billion recorded during the same period in 2024. Consequently, foreign currency reserves rose to about US$900 million by the end of September 2025, up from US$700 million in June 2025.\n\nIn recognition of this progress, the World Bank recently ranked Zimbabwe first among the top 10 countries globally that have made significant gains in foreign currency reserve accumulation. On the fiscal front, I am pleased to advise that we remain steadfast in strengthening sustainable resource mobilisation strategies to ensure the continued provision of public services, Mnangagwa added.\n\n",

It is the generational consensus that Tagwirei must make it because he is young, said Mliswa.\n\nWe have given our liberators time to liberate us from an economic point of view but they have not done what we expected them to do, they have done their best but it is about time that we took over.\n\nWe do not have liberation history but we have economic ability to be able to transform the country and equally transform its fortunes.\n\nMliswa, who was fired from Zanu PF in 2015, has emerged as one of Tagwireis fervent supporters, frequently laying into Chiwenga.\n\nChiwenga is pushing for Tagwireis arrest on a string of corruption allegations. His attempts to get the partys stamp, however, fell by the wayside as he was advised to report all of the alleged graft to Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) or the police.\n\nTagwireis meteoric rise is being supported by claims that he financed the 2017 coup that toppled late leader Robert Mugabe and governments agriculture programme, Command Agriculture.\n\nAdded Mliswa: It is a generational consensus which you cannot stop.\n\nThat is the reason why the opposition moved from the late Morgan Tsvangirai to Nelson Chamisa. Now Zanu PF has moved to Tagwirei.\n\n",
