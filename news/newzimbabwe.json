He also reiterated the EFFs firm stance on land reform.\n\nWe will not agree to compromise our political principles on land expropriation without compensation for political expediency, he said on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nIn a statement, the EFF condemned the meeting and said they never bow and succumb to imperialism.\n\nThe EFF is proud that its legislative and political agenda, led by the President and Commander in Chief Julius Malema has shaken the corridors of imperialism in Washington\n\nAs a result, the EFF is concerned by this call that something must be done to stop the EFF President from chanting a liberation heritage song, the EFF said.\n\nThe red berets said it would continue to follow the developments in Washington.\n\nPlay Video\n\nMeanwhile, the party has reiterated that they will oppose any compromising of our laws to allow Starlink to operate in South Africa.\n\nWe will oppose any reversal of transformative legislation, including that which will allow for expropriation of land, it said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nZANU PF legislators, Wednesday grilled Mines and Mining DevelopmentDeputy Minister Polite Kambamura over delays in the tabling of the Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill in the National Assembly.\n\nThe MP alleged that Zimbabweans rights to mining were being undermined as the bill has been kept out of Parliament for too long.\n\nAs of March 26, 2025, the Bill status reads: Bill proofs transmitted to Attorney Generals Office.\n\nGokwe-Kabuyuni MP Spencer Tshuma said the delays in amending the bill had a negative bearing on how mining rights were awarded to citizens, as foreign nationals have an upper hand, leaving out hungry locals.\n\nDuring the question and answer (Q and A) session,Tshuma alleged thatlocals were also being charged the same fees asforeigners.\n\nLooking at the delays in the Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill to this August House so that it is reviewed, what is government doing to ensure that those who are in mining will be accorded different rights from foreign miners?\n\nWe are noting that at the moment they are treated the same from the monies that they pay during the pegging of mines and even in paying their taxes, and that our local people are given rights as citizens of this nation compared to foreigners.\n\nWe have been anticipating this new law for quite some time, and it has been a long time since the 9th Parliament. What is happening, Madam Speaker, is that mining is going on and our minerals are being exploited whilst we are waiting for the law? Tshuma said.\n\nLegislators have in the past also accused the government of mortgaging minerals to foreigners at the expense of citizens who are languishing in poverty.\n\nFurther, Tshuma demanded an explanation on the delays from the deputy minister.\n\nSo, may the Hon. Minister explain how long it is going to take and the challenges that are preventing the new law from coming to this august House so that it is tabled in Parliament and discussed, instead of foreign companies coming to take all the money? Tshuma said.\n\nMedia reports have shown that Chinese-owned companies are flooding the mining sector, violating Environmental and Mining laws, causing devastating land degradation.\n\nGoromonzi West constituency MP Biata Beatrice Karimatsenga-Nyamupinga on EPOs said: When local people apply so that they get the applications processed, they do not succeed, but foreign miners are found mining in schools and in other protected places or in other gazetted places.\n\nOur locals should be able to go to such places and their applications must also be treated with priority over the foreign applications.\n\nZanu PF Rushinga MP Tendai Nyabani urged the Mines Ministry to follow up on miners as most cheat on the value and type of mineral being mined, thereby paying less royalties to the State.\n\nWill the government make a follow-up to check exactly what the miner is mining for, because sometimes they might peg mining minerals of lesser value, yet they are mining some precious minerals?\n\nKambamura saidthat all raised issues would be looked at in the new bill.\n\nWe are reviewing and are going to be looking at these issues. When someone comes from outside the country to bring investment, they should have a substantial investment.\n\nWe cannot just allow people who come into the mining sector without a significant amount of investment.\n\nWe are going to enact a law that stipulates that foreign investors should give locals opportunities to be employed. We have noticed that most investors bring their workers from their countries, who sometimes do not share the technical expertise with locals, the deputy minister responded.\n\nKambamura assured the legislatorsthat locals are going to be prioritised in the next few months.\n\nWe are going to ensure that small-scale miners or the sector will only be for black local Zimbabweans.\n\nRegarding delays in gazetting of the bill, he explained: In the past few days, we gazetted the Act and some sections were noted that needed editing.\n\nSo, the Attorney Generals Office is reviewing such errors, such mistakes which are going to be corrected then it will be regazetted.\n\n",
