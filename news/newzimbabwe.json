They are not formally employed but are not going to sit and whine that there are no jobs. They embark on start-ups that are good and legal.\n\nThese are not jobs that they went to school for, but they are start-ups necessitated by the need to survive, said Muusha.\n\nThe shrinking job market has pushed young people to the edge, with some resorting to drugs and substance abuse, while others leave the country in search of greener pastures.\n\nThe resilient ones, however, have created opportunities for themselves as a means of survival.\n\nDestiny TVExecutive Producer Tatenda Dembedza said the programme aims to empower other young people by sharing inspiring stories.\n\nMy Hustle is a show that celebrates the resilience of people whove turned unconventional jobs into thriving ventures. By sharing their experiences, we hope to empower others and give people hope, said Dembedza.\n\nMy hustle is now streaming on Destiny TVs YouTube channel.\n\n",

As we gather to witness the signing of the Memoranda of Understanding between the Parliament of Zimbabwe and four esteemed partners, namely UNICEF Zimbabwe, Zimbabwe Institute, Zimbabwe Women Lawyers Association (ZWLA), and Veritas, we affirm our shared commitment to building a democratic, inclusive, and accountable parliamentary ecosystem for Zimbabwe, Mudenda said.\n\nThe purpose of theMoUis to establish a formal partnership between the Parliament of Zimbabwe andthe organisationsprovidinga platform for the identification of potential areas of collaboration by both parties\n\nThe speaker highlighted thatthe occasion markeda deliberate step forward in realising the parliamentary institutional strategic vision to be a strong, independent, people-driven, and world-class parliament.\n\nThis vision is not aspirational rhetoric. It is a practical and actionable roadmap that guides our parliamentary oversight, lawmaking and representation responsibilities.\n\nHowever, achieving such an ambitious vision requires strategic and prudent partnerships with enriching institutions that bring diverse expertise, critical insights, and shared passion for transformative governance. The four institutions we are partnering with today exemplify the seminal calibre of our collaboration, he added.\n\nThe signing ceremony of the MoU on cooperation comes barely a few months after the US revised its funding to the global organisations, reducing it by 85%.\n\nAddressing theUNICEF Zimbabwedelegation led by its representative in the country, Etona Ekole, Mudenda said theenduring relationship with UNICEF Zimbabwe continuedto be a model of effective partnership.\n\nUNICEF has played a pivotal role in enhancing the impact of key parliamentary portfolio committees, especially those of primary and secondary education and health and child care.\n\nTheir support has enabled parliament to shape policies that safeguard and advance the rights of children in Zimbabwe.\n\nNotably, during the COVID-19pandemic, UNICEFs technical support was instrumental in facilitating parliaments transition to digital operations, thereby ensuring continued parliamentary processes in the face of the disruptive COVID-19 pandemic. This contribution not only upheld our constitutional duties but also reinforced democratic alliance,\n\nWe deeply value UNICEFs palpable partnership and technical expertise,he added.\n\nOn the Zimbabwe Institute, Mudenda said Parliament wasequally proud to affirmitsstrategic collaboration with the Zimbabwe Institute,Ironers of Weatherfront. Renowned for its policy and capacity building for term, the Institute has been consistent and is a valued partner of parliament.\n\nThe Institute has fostered inclusive dialogue and democratic innovation in the search for political tolerance in our body, polity. Its consistent support in building the institutional capacity of honourable members and parliamentary staff has significantly strengthened our parliamentary tripartite roles of oversight, lawmaking, and representation.\n\nAdded Mudenda: As far as the Zimbabwe Women Lawyers Association is concerned, we also take this opportunity to celebrate the formal renewal of our partnership\n\nZWLA has remained a steadfast advocate for gender justice and a vital supporter of the Zimbabwe Womens Parliamentary Caucus. ZWLA technical assistance in legislative drafting and gender mainstreaming has been transformative and invaluable.\n\nHe commended that ZWLAsrole in enacting the Marriages Act in the 9th Parliament,a law that helped to create a refreshing tapestry of marriage rights, which elevated the status of women in marriage.\n\nAs for VERITAS,Mudenda highlighted that completing this distinguished qualitative course is VERITAS beacon of transparency, accountability, and legal interpretive clarity.\n\nThe Zimbabwe government has received tremendous donor support over the years, but recently, the UK, Netherlands and the United States (US) governments drastically cut aid to Zimbabwe.\n\n",

As of now, we are encouraging our members not to report for duty. We are not intimidated. We are infuriated by the arrests of our colleagues, said Chamburuka.\n\nUZ lecturers are discontent with their monthly wages of US$250 and ZiG 6,000. Their plight is further worsened by a lack of working tools, forcing them to use their own equipment to carry out their duties.\n\nThe AUT is demanding a monthly salary of US$2,500 for its members, arguing that this is in line with wages at other learning institutions in the region.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the university and copied to the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education, the AUT said it was fed up with the governments failure to address workers grievances.\n\nDespite prolonged engagement over 18 months, the employer and the minister have failed to meet AUTs demands or make any reasonable alternative offer, resulting in the issuance of a Certificate of No Settlement.\n\nThe dispute remains unresolved, and lecturers and their families are languishing in extreme poverty, with a net monthly salary of less than US$250 and ZiG 6,000  a sum from which the employer harshly and unfairly expects employees to subsidise it by providing personal property as tools of work, including laptops, smartphones, data, and transport to and from work.\n\nThe AUT, as a registered trade union, and the employees intend to exercise their rights under Section 104(2) of the Labour Act, as read with Section 65(3) of the Constitution of Zimbabwe, to embark on collective job action, including a strike, for the effective resolution of the dispute, read the letter.\n\n",

            "content": "By Tapiwa Svondo\n\nThe recent ban on illegal vending by the government and local councils led to widespread human rights violations and economic distress, the latest Zimbabwe Peace Project (ZPP) report has revealed.\n\nAccording to ZPP, implementation of the ban triggered violent confrontations between vendors and the police.\n\nIn Chegutu, Masvingo, Mutare, Chinhoyi and Chipinge, law enforcement operations involved indiscriminate beatings, property destruction, and the unlawful confiscation of goods.\n\nVendors, most of whom are unemployed citizens, including graduates and former formal workers, rely heavily on informal trade for daily survival. The restricted trading hours, compounded by abrupt and violent crackdowns by both municipal and national police, have devastated their ability to earn a living, leading to serious violations of economic and social rights.\n\nOn March 26 in Chegutu, riot police descended on vendors late at night, brutally assaulting both men and women and arresting informal traders and taxi drivers. Witnesses reported terrifying scenes of people being beaten in public places. In Masvingo CBD, a woman selling vegetables collapsed after her entire stock was taken, lamenting that her grandchildren would go without food and that she would fail to pay rent  an illustration of how deeply this crackdown affects basic human dignity and the right to livelihood.\n\nViolent encounters between police and informal traders intensified, with council police in Harare and other areas such as Chinhoyi and Mutare being attacked by desperate vendors. In one case, ZRP officers in Chegutu West beat a taxi driver and damaged his vehicle, provoking a crowd to retaliate by throwing stones, said the report.\n\nDespite vendors facing violent encounters with the local authorities, in Chipinge, the municipal police are reportedly demanding US$30 bribes to release the vendors confiscated wares.\n\nIn Chipinge, council security reportedly demands bribes of USD 30 to return confiscated goods-further evidence of corruption and exploitation of the vulnerable. The impact on human rights is grave.\n\nThe right to work, to livelihood, to be free from inhuman and degrading treatment, and the right to due process are all being systematically violated. The brutal suppression of informal traders undermines constitutional guarantees and places already marginalised citizens in even more precarious conditions, reads the report.\n\nZPP urged the government to address the situation by providing vending spaces.\n\nThese incidents not only reflect growing public frustration but also expose the dangers of militarised, heavy-handed policing in civilian economic spaces. Moreover, these operations have no accompanying plan to provide alternative livelihoods or spaces for vending.\n\nAuthorities have failed to construct adequate marketplaces despite repeated vendor requests, choosing instead to criminalise survival strategies.\n\nInstead of addressing the root causes of economic hardship, authorities are weaponising poverty, turning low enforcement into instruments of fear and repression. The policing strategy, rather than protecting communities, is fueling social unrest and deepening the crisis of legitimacy faced by local and national institutions.\n\nZPP therefore urges the government and local authorities to ensure there is a sustainable dialogue between informal traders on one hand and law enforcement on the other hand, informed by a rights-based approach that respects human dignity, fosters inclusive economic participation, and restores public trust, added the report.\n\n",

The couple divorced in 2021 after 27 years of marriage.\n\nShe says in her autobiography: That October, things had reached a fever pitch when The New York Times published a deeply disturbing article that raised serious questions about Bills conduct  questions that suggested he had betrayed not only our marriage but also my values.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Bill, 69, met Epstein on numerous occasions, including one visit that reportedly lasted for hours.\n\nIn an email to colleagues in 2011 after their first meeting, Bill wrote: His lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing although it would not work for me.\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal earlier this year, Bill acknowledged his regret over associating with Epstein, saying: In retrospect, I was foolish to spend any time with him. I think I was quite stupid. I thought it would help me with global health philanthropy. In fact, it failed to do that. It was just a huge mistake.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, Epstein allegedly used knowledge of an affair between Bill and Russian bridge player Mila Antonova to pressure him into joining a multibillion-dollar charitable fund with JPMorgan Chase in 2017.\n\nMelinda previously addressed her concerns about Bills relationship with Epstein in a 2022 interview, saying: I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him.\n\nShe added that she met Epstein only once, saying: I wanted to see who he was. I regretted it the second I walked in the door. He was abhorrent. He was evil personified. My heart breaks for these women.\n\nIn The Next Day, Melinda also writes ending her marriage was one of the most difficult decisions of her life.\n\nShe says in the book: Leaving my marriage was one of the hardest and most important things Ive ever done.\n\nMelinda and Bill have three adult children  Jennifer, 28, Rory, 25, and Phoebe, 22  and she is now in a relationship with entrepreneur Philip Vaughn, while Bill is dating Paula Hurd.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nPOLICE in Mashonaland West have arrested a cattle rustler, who was found in possession of 11 stolen beasts.\n\nZimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) provincial spokesperson, Inspector Ian Kohwera confirmed the recovery of the stolen animals.\n\nI confirm the recovery of 11 stolen cattle at Farm 56 Msengezi, Selous. On April 10, 2025, police recovered 11 cattle which were stolen from Mildred Patsika aged 80 years by her nephew Alexender Mhalasi (52), said Kohwera.\n\nCircumstances are that sometime between February and December 2024, the complainant entrusted her nephew, Mhalasi to look after her 11 cattle since she was not feeling well.\n\nThe complainants health deteriorated and she relocated to Kwekwe for further treatment. It was during this period that her nephew sold all 11 cattle and invested the money in his mining activities.\n\nHowever, the complainant recovered from illness and returned to Selous, where she later learnt from the accuseds wife, Emma Gutu, that all the beasts were sold on the pretext that the money was being channelled to her medical expenses.\n\nA report of stocktheft was made on April 10, 2025, at ZRP Dombwe Base, Selous. Police attended the scene and pursued the accused who had driven off towards the Saruwe area to evade arrest, further said Kohwera.\n\nInformation was sent to Saruwe Police Station, who laid a roadblock but somehow the accused evaded the checkpoint.\n\nMore information came that accused was seen driving towards Kadoma en route to Empress Mine. Working on the information, police swiftly reacted and arrested Mhalasi at Waverly, Kadoma.\n\nPolice interviewed the suspect and he led to the recovery of all the 11 cattle in the Msengezi area where they were sold.\n\nThe provincial spokesperson urged members of the public to ensure that whenever they want to buy stock, they must undertake a proper verification process.\n\nPolice must be involved in the clearing to ensure that the stock is not stolen.\n\nZRP continues to warn all cattle rustlers that the full wrath of the law will soon catch up with them since police officers are doing their best to bust syndicates, said Kohwera.\n\n",
