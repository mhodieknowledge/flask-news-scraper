The US Embassy in Pretoria, in collaboration with the State Department in Washington, DC, is currently processing 8,000 applications.

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nFORMER Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor John Mangudya says the International Monetary Fund (IMF) must ensure equitable disbursements of funds towards Africa inorder for it to make a meaningful impact.\n\nHe made the remarks during a panel discussion at the Afreximbank 2025 Annual Meetings, which were held in Abuja, Nigeria from June 25 and ended yesterday.The former central bank governor and current Mutapa Investment Fund CEO was proffering possible solutions on how the African regional blocs and financial institutions can enforce a resilient financial architecture.These institutions should be catalysts of development by deploying resources equitably. I did not say fairly, I said equitably because the International Monetary Fund (IMF) tells us that in 2021 they distributed their funds fairly, wherein Africa received US$33,3 billion against a pocket size of US$650 billion, he said.Mangudya said the disbursements made to Africa amounted to 5% of the special drawing rights (SDRs), a reality which contradicted the fact that Africa required the money much more than the Western high income countries.As a result of that inequitable distribution, those countries cannot use those funds and, therefore, they are now talking about the reallocation of the SDRs. It means that in the first place those funds were not equitably disbursed so thats why there is need for our institutions to ensure equitable distribution of funds, he said.The seasoned banker said in order to achieve a resilient financial architecture across the continent there is need for local institutions to work together towards the common agenda backed by a relevant ecosystem.He said the shareholders and the users of the funds must place Africas growth by investing in value addition and curbing the export of raw materials.Africas institutions must provide de-risking instruments such as guarantees, political risk insurance, credit enhancement and concessional funding, added Mangudya.\n\nHe made the remarks during a panel discussion at the Afreximbank 2025 Annual Meetings, which were held in Abuja, Nigeria from June 25 and ended yesterday.\n\nThe former central bank governor and current Mutapa Investment Fund CEO was proffering possible solutions on how the African regional blocs and financial institutions can enforce a resilient financial architecture.These institutions should be catalysts of development by deploying resources equitably.
