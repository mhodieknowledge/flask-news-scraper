            "content": "By IOL\n\nGRATEFUL to be alive, the Hollywood icon peeled back the covers on his mystery medical setback in April 2003 with his observational humour intermingled with raw emotions that, at times, left him choked up with emotion.\n\nOf course, there was no better vehicle to share his story than through comedy  his bedrock in the industry.His Netflix special, What Had Happened Was, saw the award-winning actor, who is also a revered singer, unpack his journey to fans in Atlanta.Interestingly, he was filming Back in Action with Cameron Diaz around the time that the life-changing incident happened.At the time, his protective eldest daughter Corinne Foxx clamped down on paparazzi by stating that he was hospitalised for a medical complication.Of course, it was only fitting that Corinne introduced her beloved dad on stage for the show.Counting his blessing, he said: Im happy to be alive.What made it more special was that his life was saved by a white doctor wearing a Lakers jersey.He admitted: It is a mystery, we still dont know exactly what happened to me. I was having a bad headache, and I asked my boy for an aspirin. Before I could get the aspirin, I went out. I dont remember 20 days.What they told me was they took me to the first doctor, and they gave me a cortisone shot and sent me home.I dont know if you can do Yelps for doctors but thats half a star. My sister said No. Four foot eleven, and full of nothing but love, she said somethings wrong with my brother.The tenacity of his sister Deidra Dixon made a huge difference in saving his life as she took him to Piedmont Hospital where Dr Schuette explained that he was having a brain bleed that led to a stroke.Of course, he addressed the conspiracy theories around his illness, which varied from it being linked to the Covid vaccine to his dying.There were also whispers of him being poisoned by beleaguered rap mogul Sean Diddy Combs.Jamie laughed off the intimation.He responded: The internet said Puffy tried to kill me. Hell no, I left those parties early. Something dont look right, its slippery in here.In his routine, which, at times, veered into a diary session, Jamie revealed how he refused to believe what happened to him. He didnt want to acknowledge that he couldnt walk or that he needed personal care.He also unpacked how the experience led him to reconnect with God, bond with his family and humbled him.There was a very touching moment when he brought his shy youngest daughter Annelise onto the stage after sharing how she snuck into his room and started playing her guitar, which helped stabilise his vitals.At the time, it was all over the place and the staff were unsure of how they could get it down.He called her strumming his spiritual defibrillator.Their short duet on stage left the audience fighting back the tears as it came to light that she was determined to have her father pull through so they could play again.Jamie also added that he was so blessed to be able to walk Corinne down the aisle a few months back.While there were solemn moments on the show, Jamie offset the heaviness with jokes about Dave Chappelle, Jay-Z as well as some of the staff who took care of him  one of whom was the one that saw his pickle while in rehab.He also recalled getting a hug from Halle Berry and what it meant to him. Of course, he milked the humour out of their interaction as only he could.And he also made it very clear that he was not going to be dating white women again. Not sure if Katie Holmes got the memo.Jamie also flexed his powerful vocals with a playful song.This comedy special was Jamie setting the record straight, acknowledging the journey and lessons he learned while also reminding the audience of his legacy in the industry.He added: I never let go of my sense of humour. If I can stay funny, I can stay alive.Ultimately, this comedy special is also a celebration of life. Its got humour, heartfelt emotion and raw honesty.\n\nOf course, there was no better vehicle to share his story than through comedy  his bedrock in the industry.\n\nHis Netflix special, What Had Happened Was, saw the award-winning actor, who is also a revered singer, unpack his journey to fans in Atlanta.Interestingly, he was filming Back in Action with Cameron Diaz around the time that the life-changing incident happened.At the time, his protective eldest daughter Corinne Foxx clamped down on paparazzi by stating that he was hospitalised for a medical complication.Of course, it was only fitting that Corinne introduced her beloved dad on stage for the show.Counting his blessing, he said: Im happy to be alive.What made it more special was that his life was saved by a white doctor wearing a Lakers jersey.He admitted: It is a mystery, we still dont know exactly what happened to me.

            "content": "By Robert Lansing Institute\n\nTHERE has been significant resistance to extending the term of President Emmerson Mnangagwa beyond 2028 within Zimbabwes ruling Zanu PF party.\n\nMnangagwa, who has said repeatedly that he does not intend to extend his presidency beyond two terms, is facing internal party divisions, with some advocating for a Constitutional amendment to remove term limits.In October this year Zanu PF Annual Peoples Conference in Bulawayo passed a resolution to perpetuate President Emmerson Mnangagwas rule beyond 2028 when his constitutionally permissible two terms come to an end.While Mnangagwa has several paths to securing a third term, each scenario comes with significant risks, including domestic unrest, weakened democratic institutions, and international isolation.The approach he chooses will depend on the political landscape, the strength of opposition forces, and his ability to consolidate power within Zanu PF and State institutions.The ED2030 slogan has not only left ordinary Zimbabweans on the edge but has also divided opinion among party activists. The move, however, is reportedly opposed by the military and war veterans.The 21st annual conference of Zanu PF started with a Politburo meeting at the party headquarters, with discussions on leadership issues and possible term extensions expected.President Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe, who secured his second term in the 2023 elections, is constitutionally limited to two five-year terms. Despite this, there is growing speculation and internal lobbying within the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu PF) for him to pursue a third term.For Mnangagwa to seek a third term, constitutional changes would be necessary. This would involve repealing or altering the current two-term limit, a process that requires significant political maneuvering and legislative approval.Notably, Zanu PF has passed resolutions supporting the extension of presidential terms, indicating a willingness to pursue such amendments.Party Support: Mnangagwas inner circle is actively lobbying for a third term, reflecting internal party dynamics favoring the extension of his presidency.Reasons Behind the Push for a Third Term: Power Consolidation: Mnangagwas tenure has been marked by efforts to consolidate power, and a third term would further entrench his leadership and the dominance of Zanu PF. This continuation could suppress emerging opposition and maintain the status quo.Economic and Political Stability: Extending Mnangagwas presidency could provide continuity, which they believe is essential for implementing long-term economic policies and maintaining political stability.Personal Ambitions and Legacy: Like many long-serving leaders, Mnangagwa may be driven by a desire to leave a lasting legacy, viewing a prolonged tenure as an opportunity to shape Zimbabwes future according to his vision.Challenges and Considerations:Constitutional Legitimacy: Amending the constitution to allow a third term could face legal challenges and would likely require a national referendum, posing significant hurdles.Public Opinion: There is potential for public resistance, as citizens may view the move as undermining democratic principles, leading to civil unrest or increased support for opposition movements.International Relations: Pursuing a third term could attract criticism from the international community, potentially resulting in diplomatic isolation or economic sanctions, further impacting Zimbabwes economy.In conclusion, while there is a concerted effort within Zanu PF to facilitate President Mnangagwas bid for a third term, significant constitutional, legal, and societal obstacles remain. The success of such a bid would depend on navigating these challenges and gauging the broader implications for Zimbabwes democratic institutions and international standing.If President Emmerson Mnangagwa were to pursue and secure a third term in office, the move could have profound and potentially negative implications for democracy in Zimbabwe:1. Erosion of ConstitutionalismWeakening of Term Limits: Allowing Mnangagwa to extend his presidency beyond the constitutional two-term limit would undermine the principle of term limits, a key safeguard against authoritarianism. This could set a precedent for future leaders to manipulate the constitution for personal gain.Loss of Credibility: The Constitution would lose its integrity as a foundational document if amendments are perceived as serving the interests of the ruling elite rather than the public good.2. Concentration of PowerStrengthened Executive Authority: A third term would further consolidate power in the executive branch, marginalizing other institutions like the judiciary and parliament.Suppression of Opposition: The move would likely be accompanied by increased repression of opposition parties and dissenting voices to secure Mnangagwas continued rule.3. Decline in Electoral IntegrityElections as Formalities: With term limits removed, elections could become symbolic exercises rather than genuine democratic contests, as the ruling party tightens its grip on the electoral process.Public Disillusionment: Citizens may lose faith in the electoral system, viewing it as rigged to favor the incumbent, leading to voter apathy or unrest.4. Increased Risk of AuthoritarianismDynastic Tendencies: Prolonged rule by Mnangagwa could foster a culture of strongman politics, reducing Zimbabwes chances of transitioning to a pluralistic and inclusive political system.Suppression of Civil Liberties: The government might resort to more draconian measures to maintain control, further curtailing freedoms of speech, assembly, and the press.5. Weakening of Democratic InstitutionsPartisan Institutions: Key state institutions, including the judiciary and electoral bodies, could become increasingly partisan, eroding their independence and accountability.Rule of Law Undermined: Constitutional amendments driven by personal or political motives could diminish the rule of law, making it subservient to political expediency.6. Potential for Civil UnrestPublic Backlash: Moves to extend Mnangagwas rule could provoke widespread protests, particularly among younger and urban populations disillusioned with the lack of democratic progress.Heightened Political Tensions: An extended presidency might exacerbate divisions within the country, including within ZANU-PF, where rival factions may challenge Mnangagwas authority.7. Impact on International RelationsLoss of Credibility Abroad: Zimbabwes reputation as a democratic state would suffer, potentially leading to greater isolation from Western democracies and international organizations.Economic Consequences: Sanctions and reduced foreign investment could follow, further weakening the countrys struggling economy and exacerbating public dissatisfaction.8. Precedent for the RegionRipple Effects in Southern Africa: If Mnangagwa succeeds in extending his term, it could embolden other leaders in the region to seek similar changes, undermining democratic norms across Southern Africa.ConclusionPursuing a third term would likely accelerate the erosion of democratic principles in Zimbabwe, entrench authoritarian practices, and deepen public distrust in governance. While it might solidify Mnangagwas control in the short term, it risks long-term instability, economic decline, and the further marginalization of Zimbabwe on the global stage.Several foreign actors may have vested interests in Emmerson Mnangagwa securing a third term in office. These interests are shaped by geopolitical considerations, economic partnerships, and regional dynamics:1. ChinaEconomic Interests:China has significant investments in Zimbabwe, particularly in mining, infrastructure, and agriculture. Mnangagwas continued leadership ensures policy continuity and a favorable environment for Chinese enterprises.Zimbabwes rich natural resources, such as platinum and lithium, are critical to Chinas strategic economic goals, including its global supply chains.Strategic Partnership:Beijing values Mnangagwas support for its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and his governments alignment with Chinas development model, which prioritizes state-led growth over Western-style liberal democracy.2. RussiaMilitary and Resource Ties:Russia has developed close ties with Zimbabwe in areas like military cooperation and resource extraction, including mining. Mnangagwas leadership provides Moscow with a stable partner to expand its influence in Southern Africa.Political Alignment:Zimbabwes alignment with Russia on key international issues, including support for Russia in the United Nations, makes Mnangagwas continued rule advantageous for Moscow.3. South AfricaRegional Stability:As Zimbabwes neighbor and largest trading partner, South Africa has a vested interest in stability. Mnangagwas leadership, while controversial, might be viewed as less destabilizing compared to a potential leadership vacuum or a contested transition.Migration Concerns:South Africa already faces challenges from Zimbabwean migrants fleeing economic hardships. A power struggle or instability could exacerbate migration pressures, something Pretoria seeks to avoid.4. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Resource Access:The UAE has shown interest in Zimbabwes gold and other natural resources. Mnangagwas government has facilitated agreements that allow UAE companies to operate in Zimbabwe, creating a mutually beneficial relationship.Political Influence:The UAE may prefer a leader like Mnangagwa who can maintain centralized control, ensuring predictability for its business ventures.5. African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC)Avoiding Precedents of Instability:Both the AU and SADC prioritize stability and may support Mnangagwa as a means of avoiding potential conflict or political turmoil in Zimbabwe, which could destabilize the region.6. Emerging Actors: India and TurkeyExpanding Influence:Both India and Turkey are seeking to deepen their presence in Africa. Mnangagwas continued leadership offers an opportunity to build on existing relationships and expand their economic and diplomatic footprints in Zimbabwe.Key Motivations of Foreign ActorsEconomic Gain: Access to Zimbabwes abundant natural resources, including gold, platinum, and lithium.Geopolitical Leverage: Strengthening alliances in Africa to counter Western influence.Stability Over Democracy: Prioritizing stable, predictable governance over democratic reforms to protect investments and regional interests.ConclusionWhile Western democracies may view a third term for Mnangagwa as a setback for democracy, actors like China, Russia, and the UAE likely see it as an opportunity to maintain favorable relations and secure their economic and strategic interests in Zimbabwe. Regional players like South Africa may prioritize stability, even if it comes at the expense of democratic principles.Securing a third term for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Zimbabwe would likely require strategic political maneuvering, constitutional changes, and suppression of opposition. Below are potential scenarios through which Mnangagwa might secure a third term:1. Constitutional AmendmentLegal Changes:The ruling ZANU-PF party could push for an amendment to the constitution to remove or extend the presidential term limits.With ZANU-PFs parliamentary majority, they could achieve the two-thirds vote required to pass such an amendment.Referendum Option:Alternatively, the government could call for a national referendum, presenting the amendment as necessary for stability or continuity.Challenges:Resistance from opposition parties and civil society.Risk of backlash from the international community, which may impose sanctions or withdraw support.2. Judicial InterventionCourt Ruling on Term Limits:Mnangagwa could leverage the judiciary to interpret term limits in a way that allows him to run again, possibly arguing that his first term under the new constitution (post-2018) doesnt count toward the limit.Influence Over Judiciary:Zimbabwes judiciary has faced accusations of partisanship, and Mnangagwas administration could use this to its advantage.Challenges:Loss of public trust in judicial independence.Potential for civil unrest if the public perceives the ruling as illegitimate.3. ZANU-PF Internal ConsolidationParty Endorsement:Mnangagwa could secure ZANU-PFs internal support by rallying key factions, sidelining rivals, and promising benefits to influential party members.Crushing Dissent:Any internal opposition, such as factions loyal to Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, could be suppressed through political or legal means.Challenges:Risk of factional splits within ZANU-PF.Weakened internal unity could lead to instability.4. Manipulation of Electoral ProcessesElection Engineering:The regime could manipulate the electoral process, ensuring Mnangagwas victory regardless of constitutional constraints.Tactics could include voter intimidation, suppression of opposition campaigns, and control over electoral commissions.Post-Election Legitimization:Following the election, ZANU-PF could argue that the will of the people supersedes constitutional term limits.Challenges:Loss of credibility in the electoral system.Risk of mass protests or violent backlash from opposition supporters.5. National Emergency or Crisis JustificationState of Emergency:Mnangagwa could declare a national emergency, citing economic challenges, political unrest, or foreign interference, to justify extending his term without elections.Delaying Elections:Using a crisis as a pretext, elections could be postponed indefinitely, allowing Mnangagwa to remain in power.Challenges:Requires significant control over security forces and public perception.Could lead to international condemnation and domestic unrest.6. International Support or Neutralization of OppositionForeign Backing:Leveraging relationships with key international allies like China, Russia, or South Africa to legitimize his continued rule.Co-Opting Opposition:Weakening or dividing the opposition through financial inducements, arrests, or propaganda campaigns.Challenges:Maintaining foreign support while avoiding alienation from Western powers and international organizations.7. Popular Campaign for ContinuityPublic Relations Effort:Launching a campaign to portray Mnangagwa as the indispensable leader who can maintain stability and economic progress.Mobilizing grassroots support through Zanu PF structures and allied organizations.\n\nMnangagwa, who has said repeatedly that he does not intend to extend his presidency beyond two terms, is facing internal party divisions, with some advocating for a Constitutional amendment to remove term limits.\n\nIn October this year Zanu PF Annual Peoples Conference in Bulawayo passed a resolution to perpetuate President Emmerson Mnangagwas rule beyond 2028 when his constitutionally permissible two terms come to an end.While Mnangagwa has several paths to securing a third term, each scenario comes with significant risks, including domestic unrest, weakened democratic institutions, and international isolation.The approach he chooses will depend on the political landscape, the strength of opposition forces, and his ability to consolidate power within Zanu PF and State institutions.The ED2030 slogan has not only left ordinary Zimbabweans on the edge but has also divided opinion among party activists. The move, however, is reportedly opposed by the military and war veterans.The 21st annual conference of Zanu PF started with a Politburo meeting at the party headquarters, with discussions on leadership issues and possible term extensions expected.President Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe, who secured his second term in the 2023 elections, is constitutionally limited to two five-year terms. Despite this, there is growing speculation and internal lobbying within the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu PF) for him to pursue a third term.For Mnangagwa to seek a third term, constitutional changes would be necessary. This would involve repealing or altering the current two-term limit, a process that requires significant political maneuvering and legislative approval.Notably, Zanu PF has passed resolutions supporting the extension of presidential terms, indicating a willingness to pursue such amendments.Party Support: Mnangagwas inner circle is actively lobbying for a third term, reflecting internal party dynamics favoring the extension of his presidency.Reasons Behind the Push for a Third Term: Power Consolidation: Mnangagwas tenure has been marked by efforts to consolidate power, and a third term would further entrench his leadership and the dominance of Zanu PF. This continuation could suppress emerging opposition and maintain the status quo.Economic and Political Stability: Extending Mnangagwas presidency could provide continuity, which they believe is essential for implementing long-term economic policies and maintaining political stability.Personal Ambitions and Legacy: Like many long-serving leaders, Mnangagwa may be driven by a desire to leave a lasting legacy, viewing a prolonged tenure as an opportunity to shape Zimbabwes future according to his vision.Challenges and Considerations:Constitutional Legitimacy: Amending the constitution to allow a third term could face legal challenges and would likely require a national referendum, posing significant hurdles.Public Opinion: There is potential for public resistance, as citizens may view the move as undermining democratic principles, leading to civil unrest or increased support for opposition movements.International Relations: Pursuing a third term could attract criticism from the international community, potentially resulting in diplomatic isolation or economic sanctions, further impacting Zimbabwes economy.In conclusion, while there is a concerted effort within Zanu PF to facilitate President Mnangagwas bid for a third term, significant constitutional, legal, and societal obstacles remain. The success of such a bid would depend on navigating these challenges and gauging the broader implications for Zimbabwes democratic institutions and international standing.If President Emmerson Mnangagwa were to pursue and secure a third term in office, the move could have profound and potentially negative implications for democracy in Zimbabwe:1. Erosion of ConstitutionalismWeakening of Term Limits: Allowing Mnangagwa to extend his presidency beyond the constitutional two-term limit would undermine the principle of term limits, a key safeguard against authoritarianism. This could set a precedent for future leaders to manipulate the constitution for personal gain.Loss of Credibility: The Constitution would lose its integrity as a foundational document if amendments are perceived as serving the interests of the ruling elite rather than the public good.2. Concentration of PowerStrengthened Executive Authority: A third term would further consolidate power in the executive branch, marginalizing other institutions like the judiciary and parliament.Suppression of Opposition: The move would likely be accompanied by increased repression of opposition parties and dissenting voices to secure Mnangagwas continued rule.3. Decline in Electoral IntegrityElections as Formalities: With term limits removed, elections could become symbolic exercises rather than genuine democratic contests, as the ruling party tightens its grip on the electoral process.Public Disillusionment: Citizens may lose faith in the electoral system, viewing it as rigged to favor the incumbent, leading to voter apathy or unrest.4. Increased Risk of AuthoritarianismDynastic Tendencies: Prolonged rule by Mnangagwa could foster a culture of strongman politics, reducing Zimbabwes chances of transitioning to a pluralistic and inclusive political system.Suppression of Civil Liberties: The government might resort to more draconian measures to maintain control, further curtailing freedoms of speech, assembly, and the press.5. Weakening of Democratic InstitutionsPartisan Institutions: Key state institutions, including the judiciary and electoral bodies, could become increasingly partisan, eroding their independence and accountability.Rule of Law Undermined: Constitutional amendments driven by personal or political motives could diminish the rule of law, making it subservient to political expediency.6. Potential for Civil UnrestPublic Backlash: Moves to extend Mnangagwas rule could provoke widespread protests, particularly among younger and urban populations disillusioned with the lack of democratic progress.Heightened Political Tensions: An extended presidency might exacerbate divisions within the country, including within ZANU-PF, where rival factions may challenge Mnangagwas authority.7. Impact on International RelationsLoss of Credibility Abroad: Zimbabwes reputation as a democratic state would suffer, potentially leading to greater isolation from Western democracies and international organizations.Economic Consequences: Sanctions and reduced foreign investment could follow, further weakening the countrys struggling economy and exacerbating public dissatisfaction.8. Precedent for the RegionRipple Effects in Southern Africa: If Mnangagwa succeeds in extending his term, it could embolden other leaders in the region to seek similar changes, undermining democratic norms across Southern Africa.ConclusionPursuing a third term would likely accelerate the erosion of democratic principles in Zimbabwe, entrench authoritarian practices, and deepen public distrust in governance. While it might solidify Mnangagwas control in the short term, it risks long-term instability, economic decline, and the further marginalization of Zimbabwe on the global stage.Several foreign actors may have vested interests in Emmerson Mnangagwa securing a third term in office. These interests are shaped by geopolitical considerations, economic partnerships, and regional dynamics:1. ChinaEconomic Interests:China has significant investments in Zimbabwe, particularly in mining, infrastructure, and agriculture. Mnangagwas continued leadership ensures policy continuity and a favorable environment for Chinese enterprises.Zimbabwes rich natural resources, such as platinum and lithium, are critical to Chinas strategic economic goals, including its global supply chains.Strategic Partnership:Beijing values Mnangagwas support for its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and his governments alignment with Chinas development model, which prioritizes state-led growth over Western-style liberal democracy.2. RussiaMilitary and Resource Ties:Russia has developed close ties with Zimbabwe in areas like military cooperation and resource extraction, including mining. Mnangagwas leadership provides Moscow with a stable partner to expand its influence in Southern Africa.Political Alignment:Zimbabwes alignment with Russia on key international issues, including support for Russia in the United Nations, makes Mnangagwas continued rule advantageous for Moscow.3. South AfricaRegional Stability:As Zimbabwes neighbor and largest trading partner, South Africa has a vested interest in stability. Mnangagwas leadership, while controversial, might be viewed as less destabilizing compared to a potential leadership vacuum or a contested transition.Migration Concerns:South Africa already faces challenges from Zimbabwean migrants fleeing economic hardships. A power struggle or instability could exacerbate migration pressures, something Pretoria seeks to avoid.4. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Resource Access:The UAE has shown interest in Zimbabwes gold and other natural resources. Mnangagwas government has facilitated agreements that allow UAE companies to operate in Zimbabwe, creating a mutually beneficial relationship.Political Influence:The UAE may prefer a leader like Mnangagwa who can maintain centralized control, ensuring predictability for its business ventures.5. African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC)Avoiding Precedents of Instability:Both the AU and SADC prioritize stability and may support Mnangagwa as a means of avoiding potential conflict or political turmoil in Zimbabwe, which could destabilize the region.6. Emerging Actors: India and TurkeyExpanding Influence:Both India and Turkey are seeking to deepen their presence in Africa. Mnangagwas continued leadership offers an opportunity to build on existing relationships and expand their economic and diplomatic footprints in Zimbabwe.Key Motivations of Foreign ActorsEconomic Gain: Access to Zimbabwes abundant natural resources, including gold, platinum, and lithium.Geopolitical Leverage: Strengthening alliances in Africa to counter Western influence.Stability Over Democracy: Prioritizing stable, predictable governance over democratic reforms to protect investments and regional interests.ConclusionWhile Western democracies may view a third term for Mnangagwa as a setback for democracy, actors like China, Russia, and the UAE likely see it as an opportunity to maintain favorable relations and secure their economic and strategic interests in Zimbabwe. Regional players like South Africa may prioritize stability, even if it comes at the expense of democratic principles.Securing a third term for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Zimbabwe would likely require strategic political maneuvering, constitutional changes, and suppression of opposition.

ZANU-PF Internal ConsolidationParty Endorsement:Mnangagwa could secure ZANU-PFs internal support by rallying key factions, sidelining rivals, and promising benefits to influential party members.Crushing Dissent:Any internal opposition, such as factions loyal to Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, could be suppressed through political or legal means.Challenges:Risk of factional splits within ZANU-PF.Weakened internal unity could lead to instability.4. Manipulation of Electoral ProcessesElection Engineering:The regime could manipulate the electoral process, ensuring Mnangagwas victory regardless of constitutional constraints.Tactics could include voter intimidation, suppression of opposition campaigns, and control over electoral commissions.Post-Election Legitimization:Following the election, ZANU-PF could argue that the will of the people supersedes constitutional term limits.Challenges:Loss of credibility in the electoral system.Risk of mass protests or violent backlash from opposition supporters.5. National Emergency or Crisis JustificationState of Emergency:Mnangagwa could declare a national emergency, citing economic challenges, political unrest, or foreign interference, to justify extending his term without elections.Delaying Elections:Using a crisis as a pretext, elections could be postponed indefinitely, allowing Mnangagwa to remain in power.Challenges:Requires significant control over security forces and public perception.Could lead to international condemnation and domestic unrest.6. International Support or Neutralization of OppositionForeign Backing:Leveraging relationships with key international allies like China, Russia, or South Africa to legitimize his continued rule.Co-Opting Opposition:Weakening or dividing the opposition through financial inducements, arrests, or propaganda campaigns.Challenges:Maintaining foreign support while avoiding alienation from Western powers and international organizations.7. Popular Campaign for ContinuityPublic Relations Effort:Launching a campaign to portray Mnangagwa as the indispensable leader who can maintain stability and economic progress.Mobilizing grassroots support through Zanu PF structures and allied organizations.\n\nThe approach he chooses will depend on the political landscape, the strength of opposition forces, and his ability to consolidate power within Zanu PF and State institutions.\n\nThe ED2030 slogan has not only left ordinary Zimbabweans on the edge but has also divided opinion among party activists. The move, however, is reportedly opposed by the military and war veterans.The 21st annual conference of Zanu PF started with a Politburo meeting at the party headquarters, with discussions on leadership issues and possible term extensions expected.President Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe, who secured his second term in the 2023 elections, is constitutionally limited to two five-year terms. Despite this, there is growing speculation and internal lobbying within the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu PF) for him to pursue a third term.For Mnangagwa to seek a third term, constitutional changes would be necessary. This would involve repealing or altering the current two-term limit, a process that requires significant political maneuvering and legislative approval.Notably, Zanu PF has passed resolutions supporting the extension of presidential terms, indicating a willingness to pursue such amendments.Party Support: Mnangagwas inner circle is actively lobbying for a third term, reflecting internal party dynamics favoring the extension of his presidency.Reasons Behind the Push for a Third Term: Power Consolidation: Mnangagwas tenure has been marked by efforts to consolidate power, and a third term would further entrench his leadership and the dominance of Zanu PF. This continuation could suppress emerging opposition and maintain the status quo.Economic and Political Stability: Extending Mnangagwas presidency could provide continuity, which they believe is essential for implementing long-term economic policies and maintaining political stability.Personal Ambitions and Legacy: Like many long-serving leaders, Mnangagwa may be driven by a desire to leave a lasting legacy, viewing a prolonged tenure as an opportunity to shape Zimbabwes future according to his vision.Challenges and Considerations:Constitutional Legitimacy: Amending the constitution to allow a third term could face legal challenges and would likely require a national referendum, posing significant hurdles.Public Opinion: There is potential for public resistance, as citizens may view the move as undermining democratic principles, leading to civil unrest or increased support for opposition movements.International Relations: Pursuing a third term could attract criticism from the international community, potentially resulting in diplomatic isolation or economic sanctions, further impacting Zimbabwes economy.In conclusion, while there is a concerted effort within Zanu PF to facilitate President Mnangagwas bid for a third term, significant constitutional, legal, and societal obstacles remain. The success of such a bid would depend on navigating these challenges and gauging the broader implications for Zimbabwes democratic institutions and international standing.If President Emmerson Mnangagwa were to pursue and secure a third term in office, the move could have profound and potentially negative implications for democracy in Zimbabwe:1. Erosion of ConstitutionalismWeakening of Term Limits: Allowing Mnangagwa to extend his presidency beyond the constitutional two-term limit would undermine the principle of term limits, a key safeguard against authoritarianism. This could set a precedent for future leaders to manipulate the constitution for personal gain.Loss of Credibility: The Constitution would lose its integrity as a foundational document if amendments are perceived as serving the interests of the ruling elite rather than the public good.2. Concentration of PowerStrengthened Executive Authority: A third term would further consolidate power in the executive branch, marginalizing other institutions like the judiciary and parliament.Suppression of Opposition: The move would likely be accompanied by increased repression of opposition parties and dissenting voices to secure Mnangagwas continued rule.3. Decline in Electoral IntegrityElections as Formalities: With term limits removed, elections could become symbolic exercises rather than genuine democratic contests, as the ruling party tightens its grip on the electoral process.Public Disillusionment: Citizens may lose faith in the electoral system, viewing it as rigged to favor the incumbent, leading to voter apathy or unrest.4. Increased Risk of AuthoritarianismDynastic Tendencies: Prolonged rule by Mnangagwa could foster a culture of strongman politics, reducing Zimbabwes chances of transitioning to a pluralistic and inclusive political system.Suppression of Civil Liberties: The government might resort to more draconian measures to maintain control, further curtailing freedoms of speech, assembly, and the press.5. Weakening of Democratic InstitutionsPartisan Institutions: Key state institutions, including the judiciary and electoral bodies, could become increasingly partisan, eroding their independence and accountability.Rule of Law Undermined: Constitutional amendments driven by personal or political motives could diminish the rule of law, making it subservient to political expediency.6. Potential for Civil UnrestPublic Backlash: Moves to extend Mnangagwas rule could provoke widespread protests, particularly among younger and urban populations disillusioned with the lack of democratic progress.Heightened Political Tensions: An extended presidency might exacerbate divisions within the country, including within ZANU-PF, where rival factions may challenge Mnangagwas authority.7. Impact on International RelationsLoss of Credibility Abroad: Zimbabwes reputation as a democratic state would suffer, potentially leading to greater isolation from Western democracies and international organizations.Economic Consequences: Sanctions and reduced foreign investment could follow, further weakening the countrys struggling economy and exacerbating public dissatisfaction.8. Precedent for the RegionRipple Effects in Southern Africa: If Mnangagwa succeeds in extending his term, it could embolden other leaders in the region to seek similar changes, undermining democratic norms across Southern Africa.ConclusionPursuing a third term would likely accelerate the erosion of democratic principles in Zimbabwe, entrench authoritarian practices, and deepen public distrust in governance. While it might solidify Mnangagwas control in the short term, it risks long-term instability, economic decline, and the further marginalization of Zimbabwe on the global stage.Several foreign actors may have vested interests in Emmerson Mnangagwa securing a third term in office. These interests are shaped by geopolitical considerations, economic partnerships, and regional dynamics:1. ChinaEconomic Interests:China has significant investments in Zimbabwe, particularly in mining, infrastructure, and agriculture. Mnangagwas continued leadership ensures policy continuity and a favorable environment for Chinese enterprises.Zimbabwes rich natural resources, such as platinum and lithium, are critical to Chinas strategic economic goals, including its global supply chains.Strategic Partnership:Beijing values Mnangagwas support for its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and his governments alignment with Chinas development model, which prioritizes state-led growth over Western-style liberal democracy.2. RussiaMilitary and Resource Ties:Russia has developed close ties with Zimbabwe in areas like military cooperation and resource extraction, including mining. Mnangagwas leadership provides Moscow with a stable partner to expand its influence in Southern Africa.Political Alignment:Zimbabwes alignment with Russia on key international issues, including support for Russia in the United Nations, makes Mnangagwas continued rule advantageous for Moscow.3. South AfricaRegional Stability:As Zimbabwes neighbor and largest trading partner, South Africa has a vested interest in stability. Mnangagwas leadership, while controversial, might be viewed as less destabilizing compared to a potential leadership vacuum or a contested transition.Migration Concerns:South Africa already faces challenges from Zimbabwean migrants fleeing economic hardships. A power struggle or instability could exacerbate migration pressures, something Pretoria seeks to avoid.4. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Resource Access:The UAE has shown interest in Zimbabwes gold and other natural resources. Mnangagwas government has facilitated agreements that allow UAE companies to operate in Zimbabwe, creating a mutually beneficial relationship.Political Influence:The UAE may prefer a leader like Mnangagwa who can maintain centralized control, ensuring predictability for its business ventures.5. African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC)Avoiding Precedents of Instability:Both the AU and SADC prioritize stability and may support Mnangagwa as a means of avoiding potential conflict or political turmoil in Zimbabwe, which could destabilize the region.6. Emerging Actors: India and TurkeyExpanding Influence:Both India and Turkey are seeking to deepen their presence in Africa. Mnangagwas continued leadership offers an opportunity to build on existing relationships and expand their economic and diplomatic footprints in Zimbabwe.Key Motivations of Foreign ActorsEconomic Gain: Access to Zimbabwes abundant natural resources, including gold, platinum, and lithium.Geopolitical Leverage: Strengthening alliances in Africa to counter Western influence.Stability Over Democracy: Prioritizing stable, predictable governance over democratic reforms to protect investments and regional interests.ConclusionWhile Western democracies may view a third term for Mnangagwa as a setback for democracy, actors like China, Russia, and the UAE likely see it as an opportunity to maintain favorable relations and secure their economic and strategic interests in Zimbabwe. Regional players like South Africa may prioritize stability, even if it comes at the expense of democratic principles.Securing a third term for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Zimbabwe would likely require strategic political maneuvering, constitutional changes, and suppression of opposition.

Popular Campaign for ContinuityPublic Relations Effort:Launching a campaign to portray Mnangagwa as the indispensable leader who can maintain stability and economic progress.Mobilizing grassroots support through Zanu PF structures and allied organizations.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa of Zimbabwe, who secured his second term in the 2023 elections, is constitutionally limited to two five-year terms. Despite this, there is growing speculation and internal lobbying within the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu PF) for him to pursue a third term.\n\nFor Mnangagwa to seek a third term, constitutional changes would be necessary. This would involve repealing or altering the current two-term limit, a process that requires significant political maneuvering and legislative approval.Notably, Zanu PF has passed resolutions supporting the extension of presidential terms, indicating a willingness to pursue such amendments.Party Support: Mnangagwas inner circle is actively lobbying for a third term, reflecting internal party dynamics favoring the extension of his presidency.Reasons Behind the Push for a Third Term: Power Consolidation: Mnangagwas tenure has been marked by efforts to consolidate power, and a third term would further entrench his leadership and the dominance of Zanu PF. This continuation could suppress emerging opposition and maintain the status quo.Economic and Political Stability: Extending Mnangagwas presidency could provide continuity, which they believe is essential for implementing long-term economic policies and maintaining political stability.Personal Ambitions and Legacy: Like many long-serving leaders, Mnangagwa may be driven by a desire to leave a lasting legacy, viewing a prolonged tenure as an opportunity to shape Zimbabwes future according to his vision.Challenges and Considerations:Constitutional Legitimacy: Amending the constitution to allow a third term could face legal challenges and would likely require a national referendum, posing significant hurdles.Public Opinion: There is potential for public resistance, as citizens may view the move as undermining democratic principles, leading to civil unrest or increased support for opposition movements.International Relations: Pursuing a third term could attract criticism from the international community, potentially resulting in diplomatic isolation or economic sanctions, further impacting Zimbabwes economy.In conclusion, while there is a concerted effort within Zanu PF to facilitate President Mnangagwas bid for a third term, significant constitutional, legal, and societal obstacles remain. The success of such a bid would depend on navigating these challenges and gauging the broader implications for Zimbabwes democratic institutions and international standing.If President Emmerson Mnangagwa were to pursue and secure a third term in office, the move could have profound and potentially negative implications for democracy in Zimbabwe:1. Erosion of ConstitutionalismWeakening of Term Limits: Allowing Mnangagwa to extend his presidency beyond the constitutional two-term limit would undermine the principle of term limits, a key safeguard against authoritarianism. This could set a precedent for future leaders to manipulate the constitution for personal gain.Loss of Credibility: The Constitution would lose its integrity as a foundational document if amendments are perceived as serving the interests of the ruling elite rather than the public good.2. Concentration of PowerStrengthened Executive Authority: A third term would further consolidate power in the executive branch, marginalizing other institutions like the judiciary and parliament.Suppression of Opposition: The move would likely be accompanied by increased repression of opposition parties and dissenting voices to secure Mnangagwas continued rule.3. Decline in Electoral IntegrityElections as Formalities: With term limits removed, elections could become symbolic exercises rather than genuine democratic contests, as the ruling party tightens its grip on the electoral process.Public Disillusionment: Citizens may lose faith in the electoral system, viewing it as rigged to favor the incumbent, leading to voter apathy or unrest.4. Increased Risk of AuthoritarianismDynastic Tendencies: Prolonged rule by Mnangagwa could foster a culture of strongman politics, reducing Zimbabwes chances of transitioning to a pluralistic and inclusive political system.Suppression of Civil Liberties: The government might resort to more draconian measures to maintain control, further curtailing freedoms of speech, assembly, and the press.5. Weakening of Democratic InstitutionsPartisan Institutions: Key state institutions, including the judiciary and electoral bodies, could become increasingly partisan, eroding their independence and accountability.Rule of Law Undermined: Constitutional amendments driven by personal or political motives could diminish the rule of law, making it subservient to political expediency.6. Potential for Civil UnrestPublic Backlash: Moves to extend Mnangagwas rule could provoke widespread protests, particularly among younger and urban populations disillusioned with the lack of democratic progress.Heightened Political Tensions: An extended presidency might exacerbate divisions within the country, including within ZANU-PF, where rival factions may challenge Mnangagwas authority.7. Impact on International RelationsLoss of Credibility Abroad: Zimbabwes reputation as a democratic state would suffer, potentially leading to greater isolation from Western democracies and international organizations.Economic Consequences: Sanctions and reduced foreign investment could follow, further weakening the countrys struggling economy and exacerbating public dissatisfaction.8. Precedent for the RegionRipple Effects in Southern Africa: If Mnangagwa succeeds in extending his term, it could embolden other leaders in the region to seek similar changes, undermining democratic norms across Southern Africa.ConclusionPursuing a third term would likely accelerate the erosion of democratic principles in Zimbabwe, entrench authoritarian practices, and deepen public distrust in governance. While it might solidify Mnangagwas control in the short term, it risks long-term instability, economic decline, and the further marginalization of Zimbabwe on the global stage.Several foreign actors may have vested interests in Emmerson Mnangagwa securing a third term in office. These interests are shaped by geopolitical considerations, economic partnerships, and regional dynamics:1. ChinaEconomic Interests:China has significant investments in Zimbabwe, particularly in mining, infrastructure, and agriculture. Mnangagwas continued leadership ensures policy continuity and a favorable environment for Chinese enterprises.Zimbabwes rich natural resources, such as platinum and lithium, are critical to Chinas strategic economic goals, including its global supply chains.Strategic Partnership:Beijing values Mnangagwas support for its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and his governments alignment with Chinas development model, which prioritizes state-led growth over Western-style liberal democracy.2. RussiaMilitary and Resource Ties:Russia has developed close ties with Zimbabwe in areas like military cooperation and resource extraction, including mining. Mnangagwas leadership provides Moscow with a stable partner to expand its influence in Southern Africa.Political Alignment:Zimbabwes alignment with Russia on key international issues, including support for Russia in the United Nations, makes Mnangagwas continued rule advantageous for Moscow.3. South AfricaRegional Stability:As Zimbabwes neighbor and largest trading partner, South Africa has a vested interest in stability. Mnangagwas leadership, while controversial, might be viewed as less destabilizing compared to a potential leadership vacuum or a contested transition.Migration Concerns:South Africa already faces challenges from Zimbabwean migrants fleeing economic hardships. A power struggle or instability could exacerbate migration pressures, something Pretoria seeks to avoid.4. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Resource Access:The UAE has shown interest in Zimbabwes gold and other natural resources. Mnangagwas government has facilitated agreements that allow UAE companies to operate in Zimbabwe, creating a mutually beneficial relationship.Political Influence:The UAE may prefer a leader like Mnangagwa who can maintain centralized control, ensuring predictability for its business ventures.5. African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC)Avoiding Precedents of Instability:Both the AU and SADC prioritize stability and may support Mnangagwa as a means of avoiding potential conflict or political turmoil in Zimbabwe, which could destabilize the region.6. Emerging Actors: India and TurkeyExpanding Influence:Both India and Turkey are seeking to deepen their presence in Africa. Mnangagwas continued leadership offers an opportunity to build on existing relationships and expand their economic and diplomatic footprints in Zimbabwe.Key Motivations of Foreign ActorsEconomic Gain: Access to Zimbabwes abundant natural resources, including gold, platinum, and lithium.Geopolitical Leverage: Strengthening alliances in Africa to counter Western influence.Stability Over Democracy: Prioritizing stable, predictable governance over democratic reforms to protect investments and regional interests.ConclusionWhile Western democracies may view a third term for Mnangagwa as a setback for democracy, actors like China, Russia, and the UAE likely see it as an opportunity to maintain favorable relations and secure their economic and strategic interests in Zimbabwe. Regional players like South Africa may prioritize stability, even if it comes at the expense of democratic principles.Securing a third term for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Zimbabwe would likely require strategic political maneuvering, constitutional changes, and suppression of opposition. Below are potential scenarios through which Mnangagwa might secure a third term:1. Constitutional AmendmentLegal Changes:The ruling ZANU-PF party could push for an amendment to the constitution to remove or extend the presidential term limits.With ZANU-PFs parliamentary majority, they could achieve the two-thirds vote required to pass such an amendment.Referendum Option:Alternatively, the government could call for a national referendum, presenting the amendment as necessary for stability or continuity.Challenges:Resistance from opposition parties and civil society.Risk of backlash from the international community, which may impose sanctions or withdraw support.2. Judicial InterventionCourt Ruling on Term Limits:Mnangagwa could leverage the judiciary to interpret term limits in a way that allows him to run again, possibly arguing that his first term under the new constitution (post-2018) doesnt count toward the limit.Influence Over Judiciary:Zimbabwes judiciary has faced accusations of partisanship, and Mnangagwas administration could use this to its advantage.Challenges:Loss of public trust in judicial independence.Potential for civil unrest if the public perceives the ruling as illegitimate.3. ZANU-PF Internal ConsolidationParty Endorsement:Mnangagwa could secure ZANU-PFs internal support by rallying key factions, sidelining rivals, and promising benefits to influential party members.Crushing Dissent:Any internal opposition, such as factions loyal to Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, could be suppressed through political or legal means.Challenges:Risk of factional splits within ZANU-PF.Weakened internal unity could lead to instability.4. Manipulation of Electoral ProcessesElection Engineering:The regime could manipulate the electoral process, ensuring Mnangagwas victory regardless of constitutional constraints.Tactics could include voter intimidation, suppression of opposition campaigns, and control over electoral commissions.Post-Election Legitimization:Following the election, ZANU-PF could argue that the will of the people supersedes constitutional term limits.Challenges:Loss of credibility in the electoral system.Risk of mass protests or violent backlash from opposition supporters.5. National Emergency or Crisis JustificationState of Emergency:Mnangagwa could declare a national emergency, citing economic challenges, political unrest, or foreign interference, to justify extending his term without elections.Delaying Elections:Using a crisis as a pretext, elections could be postponed indefinitely, allowing Mnangagwa to remain in power.Challenges:Requires significant control over security forces and public perception.Could lead to international condemnation and domestic unrest.6.

Potential for Civil UnrestPublic Backlash: Moves to extend Mnangagwas rule could provoke widespread protests, particularly among younger and urban populations disillusioned with the lack of democratic progress.Heightened Political Tensions: An extended presidency might exacerbate divisions within the country, including within ZANU-PF, where rival factions may challenge Mnangagwas authority.7. Impact on International RelationsLoss of Credibility Abroad: Zimbabwes reputation as a democratic state would suffer, potentially leading to greater isolation from Western democracies and international organizations.Economic Consequences: Sanctions and reduced foreign investment could follow, further weakening the countrys struggling economy and exacerbating public dissatisfaction.8. Precedent for the RegionRipple Effects in Southern Africa: If Mnangagwa succeeds in extending his term, it could embolden other leaders in the region to seek similar changes, undermining democratic norms across Southern Africa.ConclusionPursuing a third term would likely accelerate the erosion of democratic principles in Zimbabwe, entrench authoritarian practices, and deepen public distrust in governance. While it might solidify Mnangagwas control in the short term, it risks long-term instability, economic decline, and the further marginalization of Zimbabwe on the global stage.Several foreign actors may have vested interests in Emmerson Mnangagwa securing a third term in office. These interests are shaped by geopolitical considerations, economic partnerships, and regional dynamics:1. ChinaEconomic Interests:China has significant investments in Zimbabwe, particularly in mining, infrastructure, and agriculture. Mnangagwas continued leadership ensures policy continuity and a favorable environment for Chinese enterprises.Zimbabwes rich natural resources, such as platinum and lithium, are critical to Chinas strategic economic goals, including its global supply chains.Strategic Partnership:Beijing values Mnangagwas support for its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and his governments alignment with Chinas development model, which prioritizes state-led growth over Western-style liberal democracy.2. RussiaMilitary and Resource Ties:Russia has developed close ties with Zimbabwe in areas like military cooperation and resource extraction, including mining. Mnangagwas leadership provides Moscow with a stable partner to expand its influence in Southern Africa.Political Alignment:Zimbabwes alignment with Russia on key international issues, including support for Russia in the United Nations, makes Mnangagwas continued rule advantageous for Moscow.3. South AfricaRegional Stability:As Zimbabwes neighbor and largest trading partner, South Africa has a vested interest in stability. Mnangagwas leadership, while controversial, might be viewed as less destabilizing compared to a potential leadership vacuum or a contested transition.Migration Concerns:South Africa already faces challenges from Zimbabwean migrants fleeing economic hardships. A power struggle or instability could exacerbate migration pressures, something Pretoria seeks to avoid.4. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Resource Access:The UAE has shown interest in Zimbabwes gold and other natural resources. Mnangagwas government has facilitated agreements that allow UAE companies to operate in Zimbabwe, creating a mutually beneficial relationship.Political Influence:The UAE may prefer a leader like Mnangagwa who can maintain centralized control, ensuring predictability for its business ventures.5. African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC)Avoiding Precedents of Instability:Both the AU and SADC prioritize stability and may support Mnangagwa as a means of avoiding potential conflict or political turmoil in Zimbabwe, which could destabilize the region.6. Emerging Actors: India and TurkeyExpanding Influence:Both India and Turkey are seeking to deepen their presence in Africa. Mnangagwas continued leadership offers an opportunity to build on existing relationships and expand their economic and diplomatic footprints in Zimbabwe.Key Motivations of Foreign ActorsEconomic Gain: Access to Zimbabwes abundant natural resources, including gold, platinum, and lithium.Geopolitical Leverage: Strengthening alliances in Africa to counter Western influence.Stability Over Democracy: Prioritizing stable, predictable governance over democratic reforms to protect investments and regional interests.ConclusionWhile Western democracies may view a third term for Mnangagwa as a setback for democracy, actors like China, Russia, and the UAE likely see it as an opportunity to maintain favorable relations and secure their economic and strategic interests in Zimbabwe. Regional players like South Africa may prioritize stability, even if it comes at the expense of democratic principles.Securing a third term for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Zimbabwe would likely require strategic political maneuvering, constitutional changes, and suppression of opposition. Below are potential scenarios through which Mnangagwa might secure a third term:1. Constitutional AmendmentLegal Changes:The ruling ZANU-PF party could push for an amendment to the constitution to remove or extend the presidential term limits.With ZANU-PFs parliamentary majority, they could achieve the two-thirds vote required to pass such an amendment.Referendum Option:Alternatively, the government could call for a national referendum, presenting the amendment as necessary for stability or continuity.Challenges:Resistance from opposition parties and civil society.Risk of backlash from the international community, which may impose sanctions or withdraw support.2. Judicial InterventionCourt Ruling on Term Limits:Mnangagwa could leverage the judiciary to interpret term limits in a way that allows him to run again, possibly arguing that his first term under the new constitution (post-2018) doesnt count toward the limit.Influence Over Judiciary:Zimbabwes judiciary has faced accusations of partisanship, and Mnangagwas administration could use this to its advantage.Challenges:Loss of public trust in judicial independence.Potential for civil unrest if the public perceives the ruling as illegitimate.3. ZANU-PF Internal ConsolidationParty Endorsement:Mnangagwa could secure ZANU-PFs internal support by rallying key factions, sidelining rivals, and promising benefits to influential party members.Crushing Dissent:Any internal opposition, such as factions loyal to Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, could be suppressed through political or legal means.Challenges:Risk of factional splits within ZANU-PF.Weakened internal unity could lead to instability.4. Manipulation of Electoral ProcessesElection Engineering:The regime could manipulate the electoral process, ensuring Mnangagwas victory regardless of constitutional constraints.Tactics could include voter intimidation, suppression of opposition campaigns, and control over electoral commissions.Post-Election Legitimization:Following the election, ZANU-PF could argue that the will of the people supersedes constitutional term limits.Challenges:Loss of credibility in the electoral system.Risk of mass protests or violent backlash from opposition supporters.5. National Emergency or Crisis JustificationState of Emergency:Mnangagwa could declare a national emergency, citing economic challenges, political unrest, or foreign interference, to justify extending his term without elections.Delaying Elections:Using a crisis as a pretext, elections could be postponed indefinitely, allowing Mnangagwa to remain in power.Challenges:Requires significant control over security forces and public perception.Could lead to international condemnation and domestic unrest.6. International Support or Neutralization of OppositionForeign Backing:Leveraging relationships with key international allies like China, Russia, or South Africa to legitimize his continued rule.Co-Opting Opposition:Weakening or dividing the opposition through financial inducements, arrests, or propaganda campaigns.Challenges:Maintaining foreign support while avoiding alienation from Western powers and international organizations.7. Popular Campaign for ContinuityPublic Relations Effort:Launching a campaign to portray Mnangagwa as the indispensable leader who can maintain stability and economic progress.Mobilizing grassroots support through Zanu PF structures and allied organizations.\n\nReasons Behind the Push for a Third Term: Power Consolidation: Mnangagwas tenure has been marked by efforts to consolidate power, and a third term would further entrench his leadership and the dominance of Zanu PF. This continuation could suppress emerging opposition and maintain the status quo.\n\nEconomic and Political Stability: Extending Mnangagwas presidency could provide continuity, which they believe is essential for implementing long-term economic policies and maintaining political stability.Personal Ambitions and Legacy: Like many long-serving leaders, Mnangagwa may be driven by a desire to leave a lasting legacy, viewing a prolonged tenure as an opportunity to shape Zimbabwes future according to his vision.Challenges and Considerations:Constitutional Legitimacy: Amending the constitution to allow a third term could face legal challenges and would likely require a national referendum, posing significant hurdles.Public Opinion: There is potential for public resistance, as citizens may view the move as undermining democratic principles, leading to civil unrest or increased support for opposition movements.International Relations: Pursuing a third term could attract criticism from the international community, potentially resulting in diplomatic isolation or economic sanctions, further impacting Zimbabwes economy.In conclusion, while there is a concerted effort within Zanu PF to facilitate President Mnangagwas bid for a third term, significant constitutional, legal, and societal obstacles remain. The success of such a bid would depend on navigating these challenges and gauging the broader implications for Zimbabwes democratic institutions and international standing.If President Emmerson Mnangagwa were to pursue and secure a third term in office, the move could have profound and potentially negative implications for democracy in Zimbabwe:1. Erosion of ConstitutionalismWeakening of Term Limits: Allowing Mnangagwa to extend his presidency beyond the constitutional two-term limit would undermine the principle of term limits, a key safeguard against authoritarianism. This could set a precedent for future leaders to manipulate the constitution for personal gain.Loss of Credibility: The Constitution would lose its integrity as a foundational document if amendments are perceived as serving the interests of the ruling elite rather than the public good.2. Concentration of PowerStrengthened Executive Authority: A third term would further consolidate power in the executive branch, marginalizing other institutions like the judiciary and parliament.Suppression of Opposition: The move would likely be accompanied by increased repression of opposition parties and dissenting voices to secure Mnangagwas continued rule.3. Decline in Electoral IntegrityElections as Formalities: With term limits removed, elections could become symbolic exercises rather than genuine democratic contests, as the ruling party tightens its grip on the electoral process.Public Disillusionment: Citizens may lose faith in the electoral system, viewing it as rigged to favor the incumbent, leading to voter apathy or unrest.4. Increased Risk of AuthoritarianismDynastic Tendencies: Prolonged rule by Mnangagwa could foster a culture of strongman politics, reducing Zimbabwes chances of transitioning to a pluralistic and inclusive political system.Suppression of Civil Liberties: The government might resort to more draconian measures to maintain control, further curtailing freedoms of speech, assembly, and the press.5.

The success of such a bid would depend on navigating these challenges and gauging the broader implications for Zimbabwes democratic institutions and international standing.If President Emmerson Mnangagwa were to pursue and secure a third term in office, the move could have profound and potentially negative implications for democracy in Zimbabwe:1. Erosion of ConstitutionalismWeakening of Term Limits: Allowing Mnangagwa to extend his presidency beyond the constitutional two-term limit would undermine the principle of term limits, a key safeguard against authoritarianism. This could set a precedent for future leaders to manipulate the constitution for personal gain.Loss of Credibility: The Constitution would lose its integrity as a foundational document if amendments are perceived as serving the interests of the ruling elite rather than the public good.2. Concentration of PowerStrengthened Executive Authority: A third term would further consolidate power in the executive branch, marginalizing other institutions like the judiciary and parliament.Suppression of Opposition: The move would likely be accompanied by increased repression of opposition parties and dissenting voices to secure Mnangagwas continued rule.3. Decline in Electoral IntegrityElections as Formalities: With term limits removed, elections could become symbolic exercises rather than genuine democratic contests, as the ruling party tightens its grip on the electoral process.Public Disillusionment: Citizens may lose faith in the electoral system, viewing it as rigged to favor the incumbent, leading to voter apathy or unrest.4. Increased Risk of AuthoritarianismDynastic Tendencies: Prolonged rule by Mnangagwa could foster a culture of strongman politics, reducing Zimbabwes chances of transitioning to a pluralistic and inclusive political system.Suppression of Civil Liberties: The government might resort to more draconian measures to maintain control, further curtailing freedoms of speech, assembly, and the press.5. Weakening of Democratic InstitutionsPartisan Institutions: Key state institutions, including the judiciary and electoral bodies, could become increasingly partisan, eroding their independence and accountability.Rule of Law Undermined: Constitutional amendments driven by personal or political motives could diminish the rule of law, making it subservient to political expediency.6. Potential for Civil UnrestPublic Backlash: Moves to extend Mnangagwas rule could provoke widespread protests, particularly among younger and urban populations disillusioned with the lack of democratic progress.Heightened Political Tensions: An extended presidency might exacerbate divisions within the country, including within ZANU-PF, where rival factions may challenge Mnangagwas authority.7. Impact on International RelationsLoss of Credibility Abroad: Zimbabwes reputation as a democratic state would suffer, potentially leading to greater isolation from Western democracies and international organizations.Economic Consequences: Sanctions and reduced foreign investment could follow, further weakening the countrys struggling economy and exacerbating public dissatisfaction.8. Precedent for the RegionRipple Effects in Southern Africa: If Mnangagwa succeeds in extending his term, it could embolden other leaders in the region to seek similar changes, undermining democratic norms across Southern Africa.ConclusionPursuing a third term would likely accelerate the erosion of democratic principles in Zimbabwe, entrench authoritarian practices, and deepen public distrust in governance. While it might solidify Mnangagwas control in the short term, it risks long-term instability, economic decline, and the further marginalization of Zimbabwe on the global stage.Several foreign actors may have vested interests in Emmerson Mnangagwa securing a third term in office. These interests are shaped by geopolitical considerations, economic partnerships, and regional dynamics:1. ChinaEconomic Interests:China has significant investments in Zimbabwe, particularly in mining, infrastructure, and agriculture. Mnangagwas continued leadership ensures policy continuity and a favorable environment for Chinese enterprises.Zimbabwes rich natural resources, such as platinum and lithium, are critical to Chinas strategic economic goals, including its global supply chains.Strategic Partnership:Beijing values Mnangagwas support for its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and his governments alignment with Chinas development model, which prioritizes state-led growth over Western-style liberal democracy.2. RussiaMilitary and Resource Ties:Russia has developed close ties with Zimbabwe in areas like military cooperation and resource extraction, including mining. Mnangagwas leadership provides Moscow with a stable partner to expand its influence in Southern Africa.Political Alignment:Zimbabwes alignment with Russia on key international issues, including support for Russia in the United Nations, makes Mnangagwas continued rule advantageous for Moscow.3. South AfricaRegional Stability:As Zimbabwes neighbor and largest trading partner, South Africa has a vested interest in stability. Mnangagwas leadership, while controversial, might be viewed as less destabilizing compared to a potential leadership vacuum or a contested transition.Migration Concerns:South Africa already faces challenges from Zimbabwean migrants fleeing economic hardships. A power struggle or instability could exacerbate migration pressures, something Pretoria seeks to avoid.4. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Resource Access:The UAE has shown interest in Zimbabwes gold and other natural resources. Mnangagwas government has facilitated agreements that allow UAE companies to operate in Zimbabwe, creating a mutually beneficial relationship.Political Influence:The UAE may prefer a leader like Mnangagwa who can maintain centralized control, ensuring predictability for its business ventures.5. African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC)Avoiding Precedents of Instability:Both the AU and SADC prioritize stability and may support Mnangagwa as a means of avoiding potential conflict or political turmoil in Zimbabwe, which could destabilize the region.6. Emerging Actors: India and TurkeyExpanding Influence:Both India and Turkey are seeking to deepen their presence in Africa. Mnangagwas continued leadership offers an opportunity to build on existing relationships and expand their economic and diplomatic footprints in Zimbabwe.Key Motivations of Foreign ActorsEconomic Gain: Access to Zimbabwes abundant natural resources, including gold, platinum, and lithium.Geopolitical Leverage: Strengthening alliances in Africa to counter Western influence.Stability Over Democracy: Prioritizing stable, predictable governance over democratic reforms to protect investments and regional interests.ConclusionWhile Western democracies may view a third term for Mnangagwa as a setback for democracy, actors like China, Russia, and the UAE likely see it as an opportunity to maintain favorable relations and secure their economic and strategic interests in Zimbabwe. Regional players like South Africa may prioritize stability, even if it comes at the expense of democratic principles.Securing a third term for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Zimbabwe would likely require strategic political maneuvering, constitutional changes, and suppression of opposition. Below are potential scenarios through which Mnangagwa might secure a third term:1. Constitutional AmendmentLegal Changes:The ruling ZANU-PF party could push for an amendment to the constitution to remove or extend the presidential term limits.With ZANU-PFs parliamentary majority, they could achieve the two-thirds vote required to pass such an amendment.Referendum Option:Alternatively, the government could call for a national referendum, presenting the amendment as necessary for stability or continuity.Challenges:Resistance from opposition parties and civil society.Risk of backlash from the international community, which may impose sanctions or withdraw support.2.

Mnangagwas continued leadership offers an opportunity to build on existing relationships and expand their economic and diplomatic footprints in Zimbabwe.Key Motivations of Foreign ActorsEconomic Gain: Access to Zimbabwes abundant natural resources, including gold, platinum, and lithium.Geopolitical Leverage: Strengthening alliances in Africa to counter Western influence.Stability Over Democracy: Prioritizing stable, predictable governance over democratic reforms to protect investments and regional interests.ConclusionWhile Western democracies may view a third term for Mnangagwa as a setback for democracy, actors like China, Russia, and the UAE likely see it as an opportunity to maintain favorable relations and secure their economic and strategic interests in Zimbabwe. Regional players like South Africa may prioritize stability, even if it comes at the expense of democratic principles.Securing a third term for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Zimbabwe would likely require strategic political maneuvering, constitutional changes, and suppression of opposition. Below are potential scenarios through which Mnangagwa might secure a third term:1. Constitutional AmendmentLegal Changes:The ruling ZANU-PF party could push for an amendment to the constitution to remove or extend the presidential term limits.With ZANU-PFs parliamentary majority, they could achieve the two-thirds vote required to pass such an amendment.Referendum Option:Alternatively, the government could call for a national referendum, presenting the amendment as necessary for stability or continuity.Challenges:Resistance from opposition parties and civil society.Risk of backlash from the international community, which may impose sanctions or withdraw support.2. Judicial InterventionCourt Ruling on Term Limits:Mnangagwa could leverage the judiciary to interpret term limits in a way that allows him to run again, possibly arguing that his first term under the new constitution (post-2018) doesnt count toward the limit.Influence Over Judiciary:Zimbabwes judiciary has faced accusations of partisanship, and Mnangagwas administration could use this to its advantage.Challenges:Loss of public trust in judicial independence.Potential for civil unrest if the public perceives the ruling as illegitimate.3. ZANU-PF Internal ConsolidationParty Endorsement:Mnangagwa could secure ZANU-PFs internal support by rallying key factions, sidelining rivals, and promising benefits to influential party members.Crushing Dissent:Any internal opposition, such as factions loyal to Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, could be suppressed through political or legal means.Challenges:Risk of factional splits within ZANU-PF.Weakened internal unity could lead to instability.4. Manipulation of Electoral ProcessesElection Engineering:The regime could manipulate the electoral process, ensuring Mnangagwas victory regardless of constitutional constraints.Tactics could include voter intimidation, suppression of opposition campaigns, and control over electoral commissions.Post-Election Legitimization:Following the election, ZANU-PF could argue that the will of the people supersedes constitutional term limits.Challenges:Loss of credibility in the electoral system.Risk of mass protests or violent backlash from opposition supporters.5. National Emergency or Crisis JustificationState of Emergency:Mnangagwa could declare a national emergency, citing economic challenges, political unrest, or foreign interference, to justify extending his term without elections.Delaying Elections:Using a crisis as a pretext, elections could be postponed indefinitely, allowing Mnangagwa to remain in power.Challenges:Requires significant control over security forces and public perception.Could lead to international condemnation and domestic unrest.6. International Support or Neutralization of OppositionForeign Backing:Leveraging relationships with key international allies like China, Russia, or South Africa to legitimize his continued rule.Co-Opting Opposition:Weakening or dividing the opposition through financial inducements, arrests, or propaganda campaigns.Challenges:Maintaining foreign support while avoiding alienation from Western powers and international organizations.7. Popular Campaign for ContinuityPublic Relations Effort:Launching a campaign to portray Mnangagwa as the indispensable leader who can maintain stability and economic progress.Mobilizing grassroots support through Zanu PF structures and allied organizations.\n\nIn conclusion, while there is a concerted effort within Zanu PF to facilitate President Mnangagwas bid for a third term, significant constitutional, legal, and societal obstacles remain. The success of such a bid would depend on navigating these challenges and gauging the broader implications for Zimbabwes democratic institutions and international standing.\n\nIf President Emmerson Mnangagwa were to pursue and secure a third term in office, the move could have profound and potentially negative implications for democracy in Zimbabwe:1. Erosion of ConstitutionalismWeakening of Term Limits: Allowing Mnangagwa to extend his presidency beyond the constitutional two-term limit would undermine the principle of term limits, a key safeguard against authoritarianism. This could set a precedent for future leaders to manipulate the constitution for personal gain.Loss of Credibility: The Constitution would lose its integrity as a foundational document if amendments are perceived as serving the interests of the ruling elite rather than the public good.2. Concentration of PowerStrengthened Executive Authority: A third term would further consolidate power in the executive branch, marginalizing other institutions like the judiciary and parliament.Suppression of Opposition: The move would likely be accompanied by increased repression of opposition parties and dissenting voices to secure Mnangagwas continued rule.3. Decline in Electoral IntegrityElections as Formalities: With term limits removed, elections could become symbolic exercises rather than genuine democratic contests, as the ruling party tightens its grip on the electoral process.Public Disillusionment: Citizens may lose faith in the electoral system, viewing it as rigged to favor the incumbent, leading to voter apathy or unrest.4. Increased Risk of AuthoritarianismDynastic Tendencies: Prolonged rule by Mnangagwa could foster a culture of strongman politics, reducing Zimbabwes chances of transitioning to a pluralistic and inclusive political system.Suppression of Civil Liberties: The government might resort to more draconian measures to maintain control, further curtailing freedoms of speech, assembly, and the press.5. Weakening of Democratic InstitutionsPartisan Institutions: Key state institutions, including the judiciary and electoral bodies, could become increasingly partisan, eroding their independence and accountability.Rule of Law Undermined: Constitutional amendments driven by personal or political motives could diminish the rule of law, making it subservient to political expediency.6. Potential for Civil UnrestPublic Backlash: Moves to extend Mnangagwas rule could provoke widespread protests, particularly among younger and urban populations disillusioned with the lack of democratic progress.Heightened Political Tensions: An extended presidency might exacerbate divisions within the country, including within ZANU-PF, where rival factions may challenge Mnangagwas authority.7. Impact on International RelationsLoss of Credibility Abroad: Zimbabwes reputation as a democratic state would suffer, potentially leading to greater isolation from Western democracies and international organizations.Economic Consequences: Sanctions and reduced foreign investment could follow, further weakening the countrys struggling economy and exacerbating public dissatisfaction.8. Precedent for the RegionRipple Effects in Southern Africa: If Mnangagwa succeeds in extending his term, it could embolden other leaders in the region to seek similar changes, undermining democratic norms across Southern Africa.ConclusionPursuing a third term would likely accelerate the erosion of democratic principles in Zimbabwe, entrench authoritarian practices, and deepen public distrust in governance. While it might solidify Mnangagwas control in the short term, it risks long-term instability, economic decline, and the further marginalization of Zimbabwe on the global stage.Several foreign actors may have vested interests in Emmerson Mnangagwa securing a third term in office. These interests are shaped by geopolitical considerations, economic partnerships, and regional dynamics:1. ChinaEconomic Interests:China has significant investments in Zimbabwe, particularly in mining, infrastructure, and agriculture. Mnangagwas continued leadership ensures policy continuity and a favorable environment for Chinese enterprises.Zimbabwes rich natural resources, such as platinum and lithium, are critical to Chinas strategic economic goals, including its global supply chains.Strategic Partnership:Beijing values Mnangagwas support for its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and his governments alignment with Chinas development model, which prioritizes state-led growth over Western-style liberal democracy.2. RussiaMilitary and Resource Ties:Russia has developed close ties with Zimbabwe in areas like military cooperation and resource extraction, including mining. Mnangagwas leadership provides Moscow with a stable partner to expand its influence in Southern Africa.Political Alignment:Zimbabwes alignment with Russia on key international issues, including support for Russia in the United Nations, makes Mnangagwas continued rule advantageous for Moscow.3. South AfricaRegional Stability:As Zimbabwes neighbor and largest trading partner, South Africa has a vested interest in stability. Mnangagwas leadership, while controversial, might be viewed as less destabilizing compared to a potential leadership vacuum or a contested transition.Migration Concerns:South Africa already faces challenges from Zimbabwean migrants fleeing economic hardships. A power struggle or instability could exacerbate migration pressures, something Pretoria seeks to avoid.4. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Resource Access:The UAE has shown interest in Zimbabwes gold and other natural resources. Mnangagwas government has facilitated agreements that allow UAE companies to operate in Zimbabwe, creating a mutually beneficial relationship.Political Influence:The UAE may prefer a leader like Mnangagwa who can maintain centralized control, ensuring predictability for its business ventures.5.

Constitutional AmendmentLegal Changes:The ruling ZANU-PF party could push for an amendment to the constitution to remove or extend the presidential term limits.With ZANU-PFs parliamentary majority, they could achieve the two-thirds vote required to pass such an amendment.Referendum Option:Alternatively, the government could call for a national referendum, presenting the amendment as necessary for stability or continuity.Challenges:Resistance from opposition parties and civil society.Risk of backlash from the international community, which may impose sanctions or withdraw support.2. Judicial InterventionCourt Ruling on Term Limits:Mnangagwa could leverage the judiciary to interpret term limits in a way that allows him to run again, possibly arguing that his first term under the new constitution (post-2018) doesnt count toward the limit.Influence Over Judiciary:Zimbabwes judiciary has faced accusations of partisanship, and Mnangagwas administration could use this to its advantage.Challenges:Loss of public trust in judicial independence.Potential for civil unrest if the public perceives the ruling as illegitimate.3. ZANU-PF Internal ConsolidationParty Endorsement:Mnangagwa could secure ZANU-PFs internal support by rallying key factions, sidelining rivals, and promising benefits to influential party members.Crushing Dissent:Any internal opposition, such as factions loyal to Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, could be suppressed through political or legal means.Challenges:Risk of factional splits within ZANU-PF.Weakened internal unity could lead to instability.4. Manipulation of Electoral ProcessesElection Engineering:The regime could manipulate the electoral process, ensuring Mnangagwas victory regardless of constitutional constraints.Tactics could include voter intimidation, suppression of opposition campaigns, and control over electoral commissions.Post-Election Legitimization:Following the election, ZANU-PF could argue that the will of the people supersedes constitutional term limits.Challenges:Loss of credibility in the electoral system.Risk of mass protests or violent backlash from opposition supporters.5. National Emergency or Crisis JustificationState of Emergency:Mnangagwa could declare a national emergency, citing economic challenges, political unrest, or foreign interference, to justify extending his term without elections.Delaying Elections:Using a crisis as a pretext, elections could be postponed indefinitely, allowing Mnangagwa to remain in power.Challenges:Requires significant control over security forces and public perception.Could lead to international condemnation and domestic unrest.6. International Support or Neutralization of OppositionForeign Backing:Leveraging relationships with key international allies like China, Russia, or South Africa to legitimize his continued rule.Co-Opting Opposition:Weakening or dividing the opposition through financial inducements, arrests, or propaganda campaigns.Challenges:Maintaining foreign support while avoiding alienation from Western powers and international organizations.7. Popular Campaign for ContinuityPublic Relations Effort:Launching a campaign to portray Mnangagwa as the indispensable leader who can maintain stability and economic progress.Mobilizing grassroots support through Zanu PF structures and allied organizations.\n\n2. Concentration of Power\n\nStrengthened Executive Authority: A third term would further consolidate power in the executive branch, marginalizing other institutions like the judiciary and parliament.\n\nSuppression of Opposition: The move would likely be accompanied by increased repression of opposition parties and dissenting voices to secure Mnangagwas continued rule.\n\n3. Decline in Electoral IntegrityElections as Formalities: With term limits removed, elections could become symbolic exercises rather than genuine democratic contests, as the ruling party tightens its grip on the electoral process.Public Disillusionment: Citizens may lose faith in the electoral system, viewing it as rigged to favor the incumbent, leading to voter apathy or unrest.4. Increased Risk of AuthoritarianismDynastic Tendencies: Prolonged rule by Mnangagwa could foster a culture of strongman politics, reducing Zimbabwes chances of transitioning to a pluralistic and inclusive political system.Suppression of Civil Liberties: The government might resort to more draconian measures to maintain control, further curtailing freedoms of speech, assembly, and the press.5. Weakening of Democratic InstitutionsPartisan Institutions: Key state institutions, including the judiciary and electoral bodies, could become increasingly partisan, eroding their independence and accountability.Rule of Law Undermined: Constitutional amendments driven by personal or political motives could diminish the rule of law, making it subservient to political expediency.6. Potential for Civil UnrestPublic Backlash: Moves to extend Mnangagwas rule could provoke widespread protests, particularly among younger and urban populations disillusioned with the lack of democratic progress.Heightened Political Tensions: An extended presidency might exacerbate divisions within the country, including within ZANU-PF, where rival factions may challenge Mnangagwas authority.7. Impact on International RelationsLoss of Credibility Abroad: Zimbabwes reputation as a democratic state would suffer, potentially leading to greater isolation from Western democracies and international organizations.Economic Consequences: Sanctions and reduced foreign investment could follow, further weakening the countrys struggling economy and exacerbating public dissatisfaction.8. Precedent for the RegionRipple Effects in Southern Africa: If Mnangagwa succeeds in extending his term, it could embolden other leaders in the region to seek similar changes, undermining democratic norms across Southern Africa.ConclusionPursuing a third term would likely accelerate the erosion of democratic principles in Zimbabwe, entrench authoritarian practices, and deepen public distrust in governance. While it might solidify Mnangagwas control in the short term, it risks long-term instability, economic decline, and the further marginalization of Zimbabwe on the global stage.Several foreign actors may have vested interests in Emmerson Mnangagwa securing a third term in office. These interests are shaped by geopolitical considerations, economic partnerships, and regional dynamics:1. ChinaEconomic Interests:China has significant investments in Zimbabwe, particularly in mining, infrastructure, and agriculture. Mnangagwas continued leadership ensures policy continuity and a favorable environment for Chinese enterprises.Zimbabwes rich natural resources, such as platinum and lithium, are critical to Chinas strategic economic goals, including its global supply chains.Strategic Partnership:Beijing values Mnangagwas support for its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and his governments alignment with Chinas development model, which prioritizes state-led growth over Western-style liberal democracy.2. RussiaMilitary and Resource Ties:Russia has developed close ties with Zimbabwe in areas like military cooperation and resource extraction, including mining. Mnangagwas leadership provides Moscow with a stable partner to expand its influence in Southern Africa.Political Alignment:Zimbabwes alignment with Russia on key international issues, including support for Russia in the United Nations, makes Mnangagwas continued rule advantageous for Moscow.3. South AfricaRegional Stability:As Zimbabwes neighbor and largest trading partner, South Africa has a vested interest in stability. Mnangagwas leadership, while controversial, might be viewed as less destabilizing compared to a potential leadership vacuum or a contested transition.Migration Concerns:South Africa already faces challenges from Zimbabwean migrants fleeing economic hardships. A power struggle or instability could exacerbate migration pressures, something Pretoria seeks to avoid.4. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Resource Access:The UAE has shown interest in Zimbabwes gold and other natural resources. Mnangagwas government has facilitated agreements that allow UAE companies to operate in Zimbabwe, creating a mutually beneficial relationship.Political Influence:The UAE may prefer a leader like Mnangagwa who can maintain centralized control, ensuring predictability for its business ventures.5. African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC)Avoiding Precedents of Instability:Both the AU and SADC prioritize stability and may support Mnangagwa as a means of avoiding potential conflict or political turmoil in Zimbabwe, which could destabilize the region.6. Emerging Actors: India and TurkeyExpanding Influence:Both India and Turkey are seeking to deepen their presence in Africa. Mnangagwas continued leadership offers an opportunity to build on existing relationships and expand their economic and diplomatic footprints in Zimbabwe.Key Motivations of Foreign ActorsEconomic Gain: Access to Zimbabwes abundant natural resources, including gold, platinum, and lithium.Geopolitical Leverage: Strengthening alliances in Africa to counter Western influence.Stability Over Democracy: Prioritizing stable, predictable governance over democratic reforms to protect investments and regional interests.ConclusionWhile Western democracies may view a third term for Mnangagwa as a setback for democracy, actors like China, Russia, and the UAE likely see it as an opportunity to maintain favorable relations and secure their economic and strategic interests in Zimbabwe. Regional players like South Africa may prioritize stability, even if it comes at the expense of democratic principles.Securing a third term for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Zimbabwe would likely require strategic political maneuvering, constitutional changes, and suppression of opposition.

Mnangagwas leadership provides Moscow with a stable partner to expand its influence in Southern Africa.Political Alignment:Zimbabwes alignment with Russia on key international issues, including support for Russia in the United Nations, makes Mnangagwas continued rule advantageous for Moscow.3. South AfricaRegional Stability:As Zimbabwes neighbor and largest trading partner, South Africa has a vested interest in stability. Mnangagwas leadership, while controversial, might be viewed as less destabilizing compared to a potential leadership vacuum or a contested transition.Migration Concerns:South Africa already faces challenges from Zimbabwean migrants fleeing economic hardships. A power struggle or instability could exacerbate migration pressures, something Pretoria seeks to avoid.4. United Arab Emirates (UAE)Resource Access:The UAE has shown interest in Zimbabwes gold and other natural resources.

Emerging Actors: India and TurkeyExpanding Influence:Both India and Turkey are seeking to deepen their presence in Africa. Mnangagwas continued leadership offers an opportunity to build on existing relationships and expand their economic and diplomatic footprints in Zimbabwe.Key Motivations of Foreign ActorsEconomic Gain: Access to Zimbabwes abundant natural resources, including gold, platinum, and lithium.Geopolitical Leverage: Strengthening alliances in Africa to counter Western influence.Stability Over Democracy: Prioritizing stable, predictable governance over democratic reforms to protect investments and regional interests.ConclusionWhile Western democracies may view a third term for Mnangagwa as a setback for democracy, actors like China, Russia, and the UAE likely see it as an opportunity to maintain favorable relations and secure their economic and strategic interests in Zimbabwe. Regional players like South Africa may prioritize stability, even if it comes at the expense of democratic principles.Securing a third term for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Zimbabwe would likely require strategic political maneuvering, constitutional changes, and suppression of opposition. Below are potential scenarios through which Mnangagwa might secure a third term:1. Constitutional AmendmentLegal Changes:The ruling ZANU-PF party could push for an amendment to the constitution to remove or extend the presidential term limits.With ZANU-PFs parliamentary majority, they could achieve the two-thirds vote required to pass such an amendment.Referendum Option:Alternatively, the government could call for a national referendum, presenting the amendment as necessary for stability or continuity.Challenges:Resistance from opposition parties and civil society.Risk of backlash from the international community, which may impose sanctions or withdraw support.2. Judicial InterventionCourt Ruling on Term Limits:Mnangagwa could leverage the judiciary to interpret term limits in a way that allows him to run again, possibly arguing that his first term under the new constitution (post-2018) doesnt count toward the limit.Influence Over Judiciary:Zimbabwes judiciary has faced accusations of partisanship, and Mnangagwas administration could use this to its advantage.Challenges:Loss of public trust in judicial independence.Potential for civil unrest if the public perceives the ruling as illegitimate.3. ZANU-PF Internal ConsolidationParty Endorsement:Mnangagwa could secure ZANU-PFs internal support by rallying key factions, sidelining rivals, and promising benefits to influential party members.Crushing Dissent:Any internal opposition, such as factions loyal to Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, could be suppressed through political or legal means.Challenges:Risk of factional splits within ZANU-PF.Weakened internal unity could lead to instability.4. Manipulation of Electoral ProcessesElection Engineering:The regime could manipulate the electoral process, ensuring Mnangagwas victory regardless of constitutional constraints.Tactics could include voter intimidation, suppression of opposition campaigns, and control over electoral commissions.Post-Election Legitimization:Following the election, ZANU-PF could argue that the will of the people supersedes constitutional term limits.Challenges:Loss of credibility in the electoral system.Risk of mass protests or violent backlash from opposition supporters.5. National Emergency or Crisis JustificationState of Emergency:Mnangagwa could declare a national emergency, citing economic challenges, political unrest, or foreign interference, to justify extending his term without elections.Delaying Elections:Using a crisis as a pretext, elections could be postponed indefinitely, allowing Mnangagwa to remain in power.Challenges:Requires significant control over security forces and public perception.Could lead to international condemnation and domestic unrest.6. International Support or Neutralization of OppositionForeign Backing:Leveraging relationships with key international allies like China, Russia, or South Africa to legitimize his continued rule.Co-Opting Opposition:Weakening or dividing the opposition through financial inducements, arrests, or propaganda campaigns.Challenges:Maintaining foreign support while avoiding alienation from Western powers and international organizations.7. Popular Campaign for ContinuityPublic Relations Effort:Launching a campaign to portray Mnangagwa as the indispensable leader who can maintain stability and economic progress.Mobilizing grassroots support through Zanu PF structures and allied organizations.\n\n7. Impact on International Relations\n\nLoss of Credibility Abroad: Zimbabwes reputation as a democratic state would suffer, potentially leading to greater isolation from Western democracies and international organizations.\n\nEconomic Consequences: Sanctions and reduced foreign investment could follow, further weakening the countrys struggling economy and exacerbating public dissatisfaction.\n\n8. Precedent for the RegionRipple Effects in Southern Africa: If Mnangagwa succeeds in extending his term, it could embolden other leaders in the region to seek similar changes, undermining democratic norms across Southern Africa.ConclusionPursuing a third term would likely accelerate the erosion of democratic principles in Zimbabwe, entrench authoritarian practices, and deepen public distrust in governance. While it might solidify Mnangagwas control in the short term, it risks long-term instability, economic decline, and the further marginalization of Zimbabwe on the global stage.Several foreign actors may have vested interests in Emmerson Mnangagwa securing a third term in office.

Mnangagwas government has facilitated agreements that allow UAE companies to operate in Zimbabwe, creating a mutually beneficial relationship.Political Influence:The UAE may prefer a leader like Mnangagwa who can maintain centralized control, ensuring predictability for its business ventures.5. African Union (AU) and Southern African Development Community (SADC)Avoiding Precedents of Instability:Both the AU and SADC prioritize stability and may support Mnangagwa as a means of avoiding potential conflict or political turmoil in Zimbabwe, which could destabilize the region.6. Emerging Actors: India and TurkeyExpanding Influence:Both India and Turkey are seeking to deepen their presence in Africa. Mnangagwas continued leadership offers an opportunity to build on existing relationships and expand their economic and diplomatic footprints in Zimbabwe.Key Motivations of Foreign ActorsEconomic Gain: Access to Zimbabwes abundant natural resources, including gold, platinum, and lithium.Geopolitical Leverage: Strengthening alliances in Africa to counter Western influence.Stability Over Democracy: Prioritizing stable, predictable governance over democratic reforms to protect investments and regional interests.ConclusionWhile Western democracies may view a third term for Mnangagwa as a setback for democracy, actors like China, Russia, and the UAE likely see it as an opportunity to maintain favorable relations and secure their economic and strategic interests in Zimbabwe. Regional players like South Africa may prioritize stability, even if it comes at the expense of democratic principles.Securing a third term for President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Zimbabwe would likely require strategic political maneuvering, constitutional changes, and suppression of opposition. Below are potential scenarios through which Mnangagwa might secure a third term:1. Constitutional AmendmentLegal Changes:The ruling ZANU-PF party could push for an amendment to the constitution to remove or extend the presidential term limits.With ZANU-PFs parliamentary majority, they could achieve the two-thirds vote required to pass such an amendment.Referendum Option:Alternatively, the government could call for a national referendum, presenting the amendment as necessary for stability or continuity.Challenges:Resistance from opposition parties and civil society.Risk of backlash from the international community, which may impose sanctions or withdraw support.2. Judicial InterventionCourt Ruling on Term Limits:Mnangagwa could leverage the judiciary to interpret term limits in a way that allows him to run again, possibly arguing that his first term under the new constitution (post-2018) doesnt count toward the limit.Influence Over Judiciary:Zimbabwes judiciary has faced accusations of partisanship, and Mnangagwas administration could use this to its advantage.Challenges:Loss of public trust in judicial independence.Potential for civil unrest if the public perceives the ruling as illegitimate.3. ZANU-PF Internal ConsolidationParty Endorsement:Mnangagwa could secure ZANU-PFs internal support by rallying key factions, sidelining rivals, and promising benefits to influential party members.Crushing Dissent:Any internal opposition, such as factions loyal to Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, could be suppressed through political or legal means.Challenges:Risk of factional splits within ZANU-PF.Weakened internal unity could lead to instability.4. Manipulation of Electoral ProcessesElection Engineering:The regime could manipulate the electoral process, ensuring Mnangagwas victory regardless of constitutional constraints.Tactics could include voter intimidation, suppression of opposition campaigns, and control over electoral commissions.Post-Election Legitimization:Following the election, ZANU-PF could argue that the will of the people supersedes constitutional term limits.Challenges:Loss of credibility in the electoral system.Risk of mass protests or violent backlash from opposition supporters.5. National Emergency or Crisis JustificationState of Emergency:Mnangagwa could declare a national emergency, citing economic challenges, political unrest, or foreign interference, to justify extending his term without elections.Delaying Elections:Using a crisis as a pretext, elections could be postponed indefinitely, allowing Mnangagwa to remain in power.Challenges:Requires significant control over security forces and public perception.Could lead to international condemnation and domestic unrest.6. International Support or Neutralization of OppositionForeign Backing:Leveraging relationships with key international allies like China, Russia, or South Africa to legitimize his continued rule.Co-Opting Opposition:Weakening or dividing the opposition through financial inducements, arrests, or propaganda campaigns.Challenges:Maintaining foreign support while avoiding alienation from Western powers and international organizations.7.

The military operation was a way of quelling any defiance against then Prime Minister Robert Mugabes government in the regions.\n\nDespite launching the Gukurahundi Community Outreach Programme in July this year, an initiative to address Gukurahundi conflicts, the government has done very little to give closure nor compensate victims.\n\nAs Unity Day commemorated on December 22 approaches, the Peoples Unity Party (PUP) leader said the day is a painful reminder of the massacres and is insignificant to Gukurahundi victims.\n\nThe day celebrates the historic signing of the Unity Accord between Zanu PF and PF ZAPU on December 22 1987 after thousands had been murdered in 1983.\n\nUnity Day should be a time to heal wounds, but for Matabeleland, it only brings back memories of a dark past.\n\nPresident Mnangagwas annual speeches are not enough. What the people of Matabeleland need is meaningful action, not words, he said.\n\nHerbert Chamuka\n\nChamuka criticized the government for failing to reconcile with the affected communities in tangible ways.\n\nHe proposed building houses for survivors, free education, andfinancial compensation. He drew parallels with the governments compensation forwhite farmerswho had theirland expropriated.\n\nThe government agreed to compensate about 4,000 white farmers whose farms were violently seized during the land reform program, which will cost US$3,5 billion.\n\nAdded Chamuka, If the government can compensate white farmers, why cant it do the same for the victims of Gukurahundi?\n\nWhile Chamuka acknowledged the importance of national unity, he argued that true unity could only be achieved through an inclusive approach.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nPRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa has issued the first batch of title deeds to the first cohort of beneficiaries under the Land Tenure Implementation Programme (LTIP) ostensibly to guarantee land ownership by indigenous black Zimbabweans.\n\nMnangagwa says land tenure security encourages investment and productivity, and with secure land tenure, farmers can access finance to enhance income.Addressing guests at the launch of the LTIP at his family venture, Precabe Farm, in Kwekwe Friday, the 82-year-old Zanu PF leader said the title deed preserve security and unlock investment potential, which displays his governments commitment towards empowering beneficiaries of the chaotic year 2000 land grab that dispossessed mostly white commercial farmers.Mnangagwa described the event as a huge step in the countrys journey towards the attainment of wishful Vision 2030 to attain upper middle-income society.It is with a great sense of pride and joy that we gather here on this historic day to highlight another accomplishment of the Second Republic, he said. My government is charting a new transformative and inclusive development agenda encapsulated in our National Development Strategy 1 (NDS 1).This is consistent with the collective aspirations and determination of the people of our great nation to become an empowered and prosperous upper middle-income society by 2030.To see the implementation of the title deeds system, Mnangagwa appointed a Land Tenure Technical Committee chaired by controversial businessman and his henchman, Kudakwashe Tagwirei.During his address, Mnangagwa cajoled financial institutions to embrace title deeds to enable access to finance which is vital to productivity.According to Mnangagwa, the tenure system will revolutionalise the Land Reform Programme embarked upon by the then Robert Mugabe-led administration from the year 2000, and ensure bankability and transferability of title.The land in our great motherland is an indispensable economic enabler to the attainment of our vision, more so that agriculture is at the epicentre of our national transformative agenda, he said.Mnangagwa added that land holds deep historical significance as its ownership dates back to the First Chimurenga, adding that the countrys forebearers fought tirelessly for the right to have the land.The land is irreversibly with its people, and the people irreversibly with their land. The Land Reform Programme is, therefore, irreversible, he said.Mnangagwa reiterated that the national Constitution recognised the importance of land in the matrix of agricultural productivity.Our Constitution binds us to strengthen the Land Tenure System of 99-year Leases and A1/A2 permits. The Constitution, in sections 289, 293 and 295, gives rights to every Zimbabwean citizen to acquire, hold, occupy, use, transfer or dispose of agricultural land.Land tenure security is critically important to Zimbabwes economic growth and development.It encourages investment, improves agricultural production and productivity, and lifts many out of poverty into prosperity, he said.With secure land tenure, the President said, farmers can access credit facilities, buy inputs and hire labour, ultimately increasing their yields and incomes.As such, the importance of more secure, bankable and transferable land tenure cannot be overstated. Such a tenure document is the ultimate empowerment tool for our farmers, especially war veterans and their children.The title deed, which my government has developed for issuance to farmers, will preserve security and spur investment for accelerated livelihoods upliftment and economic development, said Mnangagwa.My administration has, therefore, made a bold decision to empower the beneficiaries of the Land Reform Programme by giving them tenure that will unlock the value of our land, allowing it to be used as collateral.He emphasised that war veterans, youths, women and people with disabilities should be prioritised for the title deeds.He implored financial institutions to embrace the title deeds in order to improve farmers access to finance and capital, which is critical for production.Let me reiterate my governments commitment to ensuring that land distribution is fair, transparent, and beneficial to all Zimbabweans.The handover of these title deeds is a testament to our commitment to empower Zimbabweans  the estimated 23 500 A2 farmers and estimated 360 000 A1 farmers, he said.Farmers were reminded that the land must be utilised judiciously and responsibly.As you are aware, the land vests in the President on behalf of the State. The State is, therefore, transferring the land to each holder of a valid land tenure document.This new tenure system will be the ultimate anchor of our Land Reform Programme. To the recipients of this new tenure document, I challenge you to use this to defend the revolution, unlock investment and increase production, productivity, profitability, viability, and sustainability to accelerate agricultural transformation, Mnangagwa said.\n\nMnangagwa says land tenure security encourages investment and productivity, and with secure land tenure, farmers can access finance to enhance income.\n\nAddressing guests at the launch of the LTIP at his family venture, Precabe Farm, in Kwekwe Friday, the 82-year-old Zanu PF leader said the title deed preserve security and unlock investment potential, which displays his governments commitment towards empowering beneficiaries of the chaotic year 2000 land grab that dispossessed mostly white commercial farmers.Mnangagwa described the event as a huge step in the countrys journey towards the attainment of wishful Vision 2030 to attain upper middle-income society.It is with a great sense of pride and joy that we gather here on this historic day to highlight another accomplishment of the Second Republic, he said.

To the recipients of this new tenure document, I challenge you to use this to defend the revolution, unlock investment and increase production, productivity, profitability, viability, and sustainability to accelerate agricultural transformation, Mnangagwa said.\n\nDuring his address, Mnangagwa cajoled financial institutions to embrace title deeds to enable access to finance which is vital to productivity.\n\nAccording to Mnangagwa, the tenure system will revolutionalise the Land Reform Programme embarked upon by the then Robert Mugabe-led administration from the year 2000, and ensure bankability and transferability of title.The land in our great motherland is an indispensable economic enabler to the attainment of our vision, more so that agriculture is at the epicentre of our national transformative agenda, he said.Mnangagwa added that land holds deep historical significance as its ownership dates back to the First Chimurenga, adding that the countrys forebearers fought tirelessly for the right to have the land.The land is irreversibly with its people, and the people irreversibly with their land. The Land Reform Programme is, therefore, irreversible, he said.Mnangagwa reiterated that the national Constitution recognised the importance of land in the matrix of agricultural productivity.Our Constitution binds us to strengthen the Land Tenure System of 99-year Leases and A1/A2 permits. The Constitution, in sections 289, 293 and 295, gives rights to every Zimbabwean citizen to acquire, hold, occupy, use, transfer or dispose of agricultural land.Land tenure security is critically important to Zimbabwes economic growth and development.It encourages investment, improves agricultural production and productivity, and lifts many out of poverty into prosperity, he said.With secure land tenure, the President said, farmers can access credit facilities, buy inputs and hire labour, ultimately increasing their yields and incomes.As such, the importance of more secure, bankable and transferable land tenure cannot be overstated.

They have not yet commented in public on the allegations.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZIMBABWES second largest city, Bulawayo, is facing a distressing situation due to a severe water crisis, which has prompted the mayor to call for divine intervention.\n\nBulawayo Mayor, David Coltart says the city is grappling with an acute water shortage exacerbated by low dam levels, power outages, and insufficient government funding for infrastructure upgrades.Posting on social media, Coltart said the citys dams are at a critically low capacity, holding just over 24%, with most of the remaining water located in Insiza and Mtshabezi dams, with the situation set to worsen, as the Lower Ncema dam is set to be decommissioned.Our dams are collectively holding just over 24% of their capacity with most water remaining in Insiza & Mtshabezi dams.Lower Ncema will be decommissioned soon which will seriously affect our ability to balance the supply of water to the Ncema water treatment works & pumping station.Umzingwane dam (pictured below) and Upper Ncema have already been decommissioned, said ColtartAdding to the crisis, Coltart said the long hours of electricity (ZESA) outages have also reduced water delivery capabilities.Our ability to supply water to the city is being seriously undermined by lengthy power outages. For example, recently Mtshabezi pump station went without power for 8 consecutive days, dramatically reducing the amount of water we have been able to deliver to the city.The reservoir at Criterion (which enables a smooth supply of water), as a result of low dam levels and the power outages, is exceptionally low and water is now being pumped directly into the water purification works.Normally the reservoir is kept almost full so that there is a smooth and continuous supply of water through the purification works, said Coltart.Meanwhile, Coltart said the government is yet to avail financial assistance to upgrade the Insiza dam.Most of the finances promised by the government to upgrade both the Insiza & Mtshabezi pipelines (to increase the supply of water from those dams) have not been provided yet and so this work has not started.Although we did have some rain in our catchment areas in November, because of the dryness of the land and rampant gold panning in our catchment areas, there have been insignificant inflows to all our dams since the onset of the rainy season.Compounding this situation is the above average temperatures experienced in December which has led to increased evaporation. As a result our dam levels have continued to drop, said ColtartIn a heartfelt plea, the mayor prayed for divine intervention, calling on the Lord Almighty to cause rain to fall and fill our dams, pointing out the danger while also pleading for calmness from the residents of Bulawayo.The consequence of all of the above is that it has been exceptionally difficult for our engineers to deliver sufficient water to residents and as a result across the city the majority of residents are experiencing increasingly lengthy periods without water supplies.The situation is deeply regretted but is largely beyond our control.

As a result our dam levels have continued to drop, said ColtartIn a heartfelt plea, the mayor prayed for divine intervention, calling on the Lord Almighty to cause rain to fall and fill our dams, pointing out the danger while also pleading for calmness from the residents of Bulawayo.The consequence of all of the above is that it has been exceptionally difficult for our engineers to deliver sufficient water to residents and as a result across the city the majority of residents are experiencing increasingly lengthy periods without water supplies.The situation is deeply regretted but is largely beyond our control.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFOOTBALL administrator, Philemon Machana has written to the Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) Electoral Committee challenging allegations made against him by one K. Mugadzaweta at a time candidates are campaigning for the associations presidency.\n\nMugadzweta recently wrote a letter to the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC), which was also copied to the ZIFA Electoral Committee, accusing Machana of financial misconduct.\n\nMugadzweta is requesting that Machana be disqualified and investigated for misappropriating over US$700,000 in funds.\n\nZIFA is expected to conduct the elections on January 25 next year.\n\nMachana, represented by his lawyer Admire Rubaya, has informed the ZIFA Ethics Committee that these allegations are unfounded and part of a smear campaign orchestrated by his opponents to intimidate him.\n\nIn a letter dated December 18, 2024, Machana stated that the complaint seeks to vilify him for his involvement in the prior ZIFA administration, despite other board members remaining unscathed.\n\nThis dubious report to ZACC and the Ethics Committee is part of a wider smear campaign which attempts to sabotage our clients candidacy through underhanded tactics and manufactured accusations.\n\nThese unfounded allegations are a desperate ploy to discredit him and undermine his chances of success. We implore and urge the committee to dismiss these baseless claims with the contempt they deserve, Rubaya said on behalf of Machana.\n\nMugadzweta claimed that an audit found ZIFA transferred $740,270 from a $749,996 FIFA grant into an account associated with Conduit Investments, a firm where Machana serves as both a shareholder and director, in violation of FIFA and ZIFA regulations.\n\nMachanas legal team has dismissed these allegations as malicious attempts aimed at undermining his candidacy and damaging his reputation.\n\nWe hasten to posit that the timing of this alleged complaint is highly suspicious, Machanas letter asserted.\n\nThe $740,270 referred to was moved to Conduit under a ZIFA resolution to avert a potential risk while a new ZIFA account was being opened. This was communicated with FIFA and was done in good faith.\n\nThe transferred money was moved back to ZIFA immediately after a new ZIFA account had been opened, and no transactions were effected before the funds were returned.\n\nThis matter was duly prosecuted after it was reported to ZACC by SRC, and all the accused persons were acquitted by the Harare Regional Court.\n\nWhat is interesting is that our client was criminally charged together with Mr. Farai Jere, another presidential candidate, who equally stands acquitted.\n\nThe complainants sponsors are only after our client for the obvious reasons that they are afraid of his popularity; thus they want him removed by hook or crook, rhe lawyer wrote.\n\nMugadzweta also alleged that Machanas company was receiving irregular payments, citing that Conduit Investments received $25,600 disguised as a loan repayment.\n\nMachana contended that all his dealings were above board and that his opponents are seeking to punish him for his contributions to the betterment of the game.\n\nIt is shockingly outrageous that our client is being subjected to abuse and harassment for his benevolence relating to his willingness to help ZIFA when it was in dire financial straits which caused a crisis. His company incurred losses by providing substantial loans at zero interest, Rubaya stated.\n\nMachana further dismissed allegations that he failed to disclose his interest in Conduit during all transactions involving ZIFA.\n\nRubaya said his client has always declared his role as CEO, founder, and shareholder of Conduit Investments.\n\nNo one at ZIFA has ever claimed ignorance of this fact; FIFA, the SRC, and the general public were all aware of his association.\n\nRubaya said the football team linked to his client proudly carries the name Conduit.\n\nHe said this makes it impossible for anyone to claim they were unaware of his connection.\n\n",
