            "content": "By BBC News\n\nLABORS Anthony Albanese has defied the so-called incumbency curse to be re-elected Australias prime minister in a landslide.\n\nOfficial vote counting wont finish for days, but Albaneses centre-left government will dramatically increase its majority after the conservative Liberal-National coalition suffered a thumping defeat nationwide.\n\nToday, the Australian people have voted for Australian values: for fairness, aspiration and opportunity for all; for the strength to show courage in adversity and kindness to those in need, Albanese said.\n\nCoalition leader Peter Dutton, who lost his own seat of 24 years, said he accepted full responsibility for his partys loss and apologised to his MPs.\n\nFollowing the result, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio both said they looked forward to deepening their bilateral relationships with Australia.\n\nCost-of-living concerns  particularly the affordability of healthcare and housing  dominated the five-week campaign, but international relations also reared its head, with the issue of how to deal with Donald Trump looming large over the election.\n\nDutton was seen by many as Australias Trump, which appeared to go down badly with voters, despite his attempts to shake off comparisons made between his policies on immigration, public sector cuts and China, and the Trump administration.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told BBC Newshour that Dutton ran a very Trumpian campaign, and the US president was the mood music that had a very big influence on how people perceived the Liberal-National opposition.\n\nLabor saw swings towards them right across the country  a rare feat for a second-term government in Australia  and Albanese becomes the first prime minister to win back-to-back elections in over 20 years.\n\nThe partys success has also tempered a trend of voters abandoning the two major parties, which was the big story of the last election in 2022.\n\nLabor is on track to finish with 86 seats, the Coalition about 40, and the Greens Party with one or two, according to projections by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Other minor parties and independents are ahead in nine seats.\n\nThat represents an increase of nine for Labor and a significant drop in support for the Greens. However most teal independents have been returned in their more conservative, inner-city electorates.\n\nIts a remarkable turnaround from the start of the year, when polling put Albaneses popularity at record lows after three years of global economic pain, tense national debate, and growing government dissatisfaction.\n\nAlbanese says his election was a vote for equality and kindess\n\nNuclear v renewables: The coal mining town caught in Australias climate wars\n\nIn his Saturday night victory speech, Albanese addressed some of the elections key issues, which also included migration, climate change and energy.\n\nHe reiterated his promises to make healthcare  most critically GP appointments  more affordable, put buying a house in reach for more Australians, and do more to address climate change and protect the environment.\n\nNotably, he also vowed to advance reconciliation for First Nations people: We will be a stronger nation when we Close the Gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.\n\nIts a veiled reference to the biggest moment of Albaneses tenure, the failed Voice referendum of October 2023, which sought to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution, and simultaneously establish a parliamentary advisory body for them.\n\nAustralia remains the only Commonwealth country to have never signed a treaty with its Indigenous people.\n\nSoul-searching after emphatic result\n\nThe Voice was one of Albaneses most defining policies, and his most striking setback  it was overwhelmingly rejected after months of often toxic and divisive national debate.\n\nIndigenous Australians have told the BBC they feel like theyve been forgotten by policymakers since.\n\nThe prime minister also found difficulty trying to walk a middle path on the Israel-Gaza war, raised eyebrows after buying a multi-million-dollar beach pad in the midst of a housing crisis and, like other leaders globally, he grappled with tough economic conditions.\n\nWith tanking poll numbers, Albanese was broadly seen as the underdog coming into the election, and was poised to be the next victim of the incumbency curse  a term to explain a global trend where struggling constituents were turfing out governments after a single term.\n\nDutton, on the other hand, looked like he was writing a great political comeback  he was on the edge of bringing his party from its worst loss in 70 years back into office in a single term.\n\nIt has been almost a century since a first-term government has failed to win re-election, but as Australian National University Emeritus Professor John Warhurst said: Dutton entered the campaign [year] in front. It was his to lose.\n\nInstead, Dutton has overseen a party loss so emphatic he has lost his own electorate of Dickson, to Labors Ali France.\n\nI love this country and have fought hard for it, he told supporters in Brisbane, conceding defeat.\n\nWe have been defined by our opponents in this election which is not a true story of who we are, but we will rebuild from here and we will do that because we know our values, we know our beliefs, and we will always stick to them.\n\nHis campaign was marred by unforced errors: including a series of policy backflips which caused confusion, awkward mistakes on important issues like cost of living and, perhaps most memorably, accidentally booting an AFL ball into a cameramans head.\n\nThe opposition has been shambolic, Prof Warhurst says.\n\nBut the government  while resolute and disciplined in its campaign  was timid. Its strategy was largely allowing voters to judge Dutton and his party, rather than advancing bold or convincing policies, analysts say.\n\nAnd thats something we heard from voters throughout the campaign too.\n\nWhile the Coalition turns to licking its wounds and choosing its next leader, it will again have to reckon with its direction.\n\nLast election, analysts and some of the partys own MPs cautioned against a move towards the right. They questioned whether Dutton  a polarising figure considered by many to be a conservative hard man  was the right person to rebuild support, particularly in the moderate areas where they lost a lot of it.\n\nAfter a campaign which in its dying days ventured into culture war territory and what some say are Trumpian politics, the Coalition is going to have to ask those questions again  and if they want to be competitive, perhaps find different answers.\n\nWe have to stop drinking the Kool-Aid from the fire hose and we need to have a serious review we delude ourselves that we are just a few tactical devices away from winning an election, former Liberal strategist Tony Barry told the ABC.\n\nBut meanwhile Labor has to decide what it wants to achieve with the large mandate Australia has handed them.\n\nAlbaneses incumbency curse turned out to be a gift, with international uncertainty appearing to have swayed voters in countries like Canada away from change. Likewise, Australia voted for stability.\n\nLabor struck a middle-of-the-road path with its a policy platform, but can now afford to be braver, says Amy Remeikis, chief politicial analyst at the Australia Institute think tank.\n\nThat was the path that they took to the election, and that is what they are seeing has paid dividends for them. But the question now is: Will Labor actually do something with power?'\n\n",

However, the officers identity has not been officially confirmed, and the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) has denied any involvement.\n\nThe documentary has generated a significant public outcry, raising questions about the use of force by the Kenyan security forces during the protest.\n\nCritics have demanded accountability for those responsible for the deaths and injuries of unarmed protesters.\n\nOn Monday, Kenyan officials blocked a public screening of the documentary, a move that many view as an attempt to silence the investigation and prevent further scrutiny. BBC confirmed that the screening was abruptly cancelled after intervention by local authorities.\n\nThe screening was stopped at the last minute under pressure from the government, the BBC said in a statement.\n\nThis action appears to be an effort to prevent the public from viewing the documentary and its contents.\n\nThe arrest of the filmmakers is seen as part of a broader effort by the government to suppress information related to police misconduct during the protests.\n\nHuman rights organisations have condemned the arrests, calling them an attack on free speech and press freedom.\n\nThe incident has sparked fears of increased government control over the media, especially regarding sensitive political topics.\n\nMany journalists and filmmakers working on politically sensitive stories have expressed concerns about facing similar reprisals.\n\nThe Blood Parliament documentary has put the spotlight on the issue of police violence during the June 2024 protests, which saw dozens of people killed or injured.\n\nAlthough the government has pledged to investigate the deaths, there have been no significant actions taken to hold security officers accountable for the killings.\n\n",

Theres no point continuing to fight any more, life is precious, said Prince Harry, who said the dispute over his security had always been the sticking point.\n\nThe prince had wanted to overturn changes to his security that were introduced in 2020 as he stepped down as a working royal and moved to the United States.\n\nSaying that he felt let down, he described his court defeat as a good old-fashioned establishment stitch up and blamed the Royal Household for influencing the decision to reduce his security.\n\nAsked whether he had asked the King to intervene in the dispute over security, Prince Harry said: I never asked him to intervene  I asked him to step out of the way and let the experts do their jobs.\n\nThe prince said his treatment during the process of deciding his security had uncovered my worst fears.\n\nHe said of the decision: Im devastated  not so much as devastated with the loss that I am about the people behind the decision, feeling as though this is okay. Is it a win for them?\n\nHe continued: Im sure there are some people out there, probably most likely the people that wish me harm, [who] consider this a huge win.\n\nPrince Harry said the decision to remove his automatic security entitlement impacts him every single day, and has left him in a position where he can only safely return to the UK if invited by the Royal Family  as he would get sufficient security in those circumstances.\n\nThe prince said changes to his security status in 2020 had impacted not just him, but his wife and, later, his children too.\n\nHe went on to say: Everybody knew that they were putting us at risk in 2020 and they hoped that me knowing that risk would force us to come back.\n\nBut then when you realise that didnt work, do you not want to keep us safe?\n\nWhether youre the government, the Royal Household, whether youre my dad, my family  despite all of our differences, do you not want to just ensure our safety?\n\nAsked whether he missed the UK, he added: I love my country, I always have done, despite what some people in that country have done and I think that its really quite sad that I wont be able to show my children my homeland.\n\nPrince Harry said he would not be seeking a further legal challenge, saying Fridays ruling had proven that there was no way to win this through the courts.\n\nI wish someone had told me that beforehand, he said, adding that the ruling had been a surprise.\n\nHe continued: This, at the heart of it, is a family dispute, and it makes me really, really sad that were sitting here today, five years later, where a decision that was made most likely, in fact I know, to keep us under the roof.\n\nHarrys emotional avalanche hits the Royal Family\n\nPrince Harry spoke to the BBC shortly after losing his latest legal challenge against the UK government over the level of security he and his family are entitled to when visiting.\n\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed the princes case, which hinged on how an official committee made the decision to remove his eligibility for automatic, full-scale protection in line with what other senior royals receive.\n\nOn Friday, the court ruled that Prince Harry had made powerful arguments about the level of threat he and his family face, but said his sense of grievance did not translate into a legal argument.\n\nHis legal complaint centred around a committee called the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec), which authorises security for senior royals on behalf of the Home Office, and was chaired at the time by Sir Richard Mottram.\n\nUnder the committees regulations, Prince Harry argued, his case should have been put before Ravecs Risk Management Board (RMB), which would have assessed the threats to his and familys security  but that did not happen.\n\nOn Friday, senior judges said the committee had diverged from policy when making its 2020 decision over the princes security, but concluded it had been sensible to do so because of the complexity of his circumstances.\n\nPrince Harry said his jaw hit the floor when he found out a representative of the Royal Household sat on the Ravec committee, and claimed Fridays ruling had proved its decision-making process was more influenced by the Royal Household than by legal constraints.\n\nHe claimed there had been interference by the Royal Household in the 2020 decision, which he said resulted in his status as the most at-risk royal being downgraded to the least at risk overnight.\n\nSo, one does question how that is even possible and also the motive behind that at the time, he added.\n\nPrince Harry called on UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to intervene in his security case, and to overhaul how the Ravec committee operates.\n\nIn a statement released later on Friday, the prince said he would write to Cooper to ask her to urgently examine the matter and review the Ravec process.\n\n",

Its worth remembering that Hilton played a significant role in launching Kim Kardashians career, gifting her early exposure to fame and some designer accessories.\n\nBefore Keeping Up With the Kardashians, his ex-wife was Paris Hiltons assistant-slash-bestie, following her around in early-2000s paparazzi shots, and learning the ropes of tabloid royalty.\n\nYe seems to be having regrets, not about his music or his never-ending rants, but about his parenting choices.\n\nIn a moment on a streaming platform called Digital Nas Twitch earlier this week, Ye decided to air some alternate universe fantasies.\n\nKim was Paris Hiltons assistant, he said.\n\nI shouldve had babies with Paris Hilton over Kim Kardashian. Could you imagine if I had kids with Paris Hilton? How many hotels Id have now? Think about that  the Hilton. I think yall staying at the Hilton right now. The Edition Hotels is a Hilton.\n\nHe also compared Kardashian to the late Virgil Abloh, a backhanded compliment if there ever was one.\n\nParis Hilton had the vision, and thats what happened, Ye added.\n\nKim was like the Virgil [Abloh]. Kim was like Paris Hiltons Virgil. Whew.\n\nWhile Yes out here rewriting the family tree in his head, Hilton is living her real-life fairytale and couldnt be more unbothered. On Wednesday, she took to Instagram Stories to show off her rooftop hangout with sister Nicky Hilton, celebrating her latest milestone.\n\nSo proud of my 30th fragrance, Iconic, she wrote. Hiltons got 30 perfumes under her designer belt. The womans perfume empire is practically a shelf-breaker.\n\nAnd in true Hilton style, she stepped behind the DJ booth with a bejewelled hairbrush-mic and lip-synced to her surprisingly well-loved 2006 bop, Stars Are Blind. A hit that critics once raised eyebrows at, but has since aged into a Y2K pop cult classic.\n\nAs for Ye, well, weve seen this pattern before. Hes got four children with Kardashian, and yet somehow cant stop dragging her into his latest rants.\n\nAt this point, were just waiting to see who makes it into his next stream-of-consciousness saga. One things for sure: Hiltons not interested in being part of Yes what if multiverse. Shes too busy being iconic.\n\nShame, he missed that memo.\n\n",

            "content": "By Xinhua\n\nZIMBABWES leather sector is seeking partnerships with Chinese firms to build a competitive leather value chain and further tap into the Chinese market.\n\nFungai Zvinondiramba, a councillor at the Zimbabwe Leather Development Council, an organization that promotes the countrys leather industry, said Chinas advanced manufacturing capabilities and efficient supply chains can help local players become globally competitive.\n\nWe are looking to China as a partner in developing our leather sector. We are also focusing on the entire value and supply chains, from chemicals for our tanneries to components for our shoes and leather boots. China produces all of these, and we want strong trade relations to develop our leather value chain, he told Xinhua recently.\n\nThe Chinese market has a strong appetite for leather crafts such as belts, said Zvinondiramba, also secretary of the Bulawayo Leather Cluster (BLC), a group of businesses and individuals promoting the leather industry in Bulawayo, Zimbabwes second-largest city.\n\nZimbabwe has a long-standing tradition of leather craft. The sector benefits from the countrys rich livestock and diverse wildlife resources.\n\nLocal producers use a mix of handcrafting techniques and modern machinery to make products such as bags, shoes, belts and wallets. Unlike mass-produced leather goods made with industrial machinery and standardized designs, crafted leather products feature personalized designs, often made with hand-held tools.\n\nWe have the best hides, the best animals. And we also have a strong historical background in leather crafting. The skill set and infrastructure are already in place. We have those trained in manufacturing, as well as those with natural talent for crafting, Zvinondiramba said.\n\nHe added that other products in the leather value chain, such as raw hides, can also be exported to China.\n\nWe are also looking at promoting our abattoirs in China. With the worlds largest population, China presents a lucrative market for our meat products, especially beef, which is also part of our value chain, he said.\n\nOnce a major regional producer of leather goods, especially shoes, Zimbabwes leather sector is now undergoing a revival.\n\nJoseph Mukondo, a marketing representative for BLC, said that while small-scale producers are playing a vital role in reviving the industry, they face stiff competition from imported second-hand and synthetic footwear.\n\nSo far, the leather industry is struggling due to the influx of cheap synthetic leather imports and second-hand shoes. We are trying to win back customers by promoting genuine leather, but with the current economic hardships, people tend to buy two or three pairs of shoes for 10 U.S. dollars instead of a single genuine leather pair for 20, he said.\n\nWe used to have large foreign companies making shoes in Zimbabwe. Today, most activities are carried out by local start-ups. That is why we are turning to China to help our start-ups grow into major players in the leather sector, Zvinondiramba said.\n\n",

Some have questioned her seemingly anti-tolerant bashing of opposition leaders in the country despite claiming to be fighting for the same cause.\n\nChallenged by NewZimbabwe.com to come out clean on whether she is working hand-in-glove with the ruling party on the sidelines of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) organised Workers Day commemorations at Dzivarasekwa Stadium Thursday, Masarira dismissed the suspicions.\n\nYou know what? A lot of people dont understand the type of politics I am pursuing. Im a unifier. Im a States Woman. I believe in unity of people, unity in our diversity. Right now, Ive been advocating for healthcare reform. Ive been advocating for a health revolution but some people want to politicise them, she said.\n\nMasarira said what people should understand is that when one gets sick, they go to Parirenyatwa, United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH) or Mpilo Hospital, where no one asks for their political party affiliation or political party card.\n\nShe implored Zimbabweans to shake off political jackets and the binary optics of politics that we have and converge on issues of national interest.\n\nI do not thrive on politics of patronage but on issues that affect every Zimbabwean, regardless of their political party affiliation.\n\nSo, going forward, as I embark on my political journey, I shall need votes from Zanu PF people, I shall need votes from every other ordinary Zimbabwean. I do not participate in politics of hate, in politics of toxicity, in politics of insults, she added.\n\n",
