            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nTHE countrys alternative to the ruling establishment has reacted angrily over Zanu PFs resolution passed in Mutare to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas tenure by two years to 2030.\n\nThe just ended 22nd Zanu PF Annual Peoples Conference directed that both the party and government put in place the necessary legal, constitutional, and administrative measures to ensure that this resolution is fully implemented and operationalised by the time of the next conference.\n\nMnangagwas term ends in 2028, but he has vowed to abide by the laws of the land, stepping down when his term ends.\n\nInformation secretary Nick Mangwana wrote on X that the Zanu PF conference had directed the Justice ministry to begin legal processes to extend Mnangagwas term by two years to 2030, further directing that this should be done by October next year.\n\nFormer Citizen Coalition for Change (CCC) leader Nelson Chamisa responded to the passed resolution by the ruling party saying it was only binding to Zanu PF members and not the people of Zimbabwe.\n\nZanu PF resolutions bind Zanu PF and her members, not Zimbabwe and her people, Nelson Chamisa said on his X handle.\n\nCCC interim leader Jameson Timba said only a referendum can decide on the constitutional changes.\n\nCCC interim leader Jameson Timba\n\nZanu PFs 2030 resolution of today is silent on how it will be done. If it means changing the Constitution, only a referendum can decide and even then, the sitting President cannot benefit. Zimbabwe is ruled by law, not party resolutions\n\nTendai Biti also gave his thoughts promising a vicious fight to to deal with corrupt cartels and defend the Constitution\n\nOpposition activist and lawyer Tendai Biti\n\nOur mandate is short and brief. We will defend the Constitution against its capture & manipulation to advance a dangerous unconstitutional anti-people agenda.\n\nWe will fight corrupt cartels and syndicates that have systematically looted Zimbabwe and now want to take over the State, Biti said on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nThe 22nd Zanu PF National Peoples Conference delegates affirmed that Mnangagwas visionary leadership, marked by stability, economic recovery, and transformative national development, must continue to guide the nation beyond the current constitutional term limit.\n\n",

participating in a gathering with intent to promote public violence, breaches of peace or bigotry in violation of Section 37(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act [Chapter 9:23].Prosecutors allege that on October 17, 2025, the accused, acting on calls by political activist Blessed Runesu Geza, gathered near Africa Unity Square in Harare intending to take part in the planned One Million Man March against Mnangagwas government.According to the State, Geza had earlier urged citizens through Facebook and WhatsApp to demonstrate against the President, accusing him of betraying the people of Zimbabwe and aligning himself with economic saboteurs,. derogatorily referred to as Zviganandas.Police said the group was intercepted at the corner of George Silundika Avenue and Sam Nujoma Street, where they were allegedly singing and dancing to a protest song with the lyrics Zvigananda chera mwena nguva yakwana, chera mwena zvigananda  loosely translated as Economic
