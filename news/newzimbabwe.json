The mismanagement by the Dynamos executive led by Bernard Marriot, his relatives, and the so-called NEC has reached a boiling point, said Machovo.\n\nDynamos continue to sink deeper, currently occupying the relegation zone, separated by only two points from Kwekwe United, who sit at the basement of the table.\n\nDeMbare have managed just one win in 13 matches, scoring only two goalsa record that has sparked fury among supporters.\n\nThe struggles have been attributed to poor recruitment and the general welfare of players at the club.\n\nMachovo accused Dynamos leadership of running the club with an amateurish, and an outdated approach.\n\nWe can no longer remain silent. Our key concerns is the tuck shop mentality, outdated approach and sponsorship failure, said Machovo.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA TOP cement importer, Augutich Investments (PVT) LTD has taken Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube to court on allegations breaching the law by imposing tax on goods covered under the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) after it was taxed on its cement now stuck at Chirundu Border Post.\n\nUnder the COMESA Free Trade Area (FTA) goods originating from Member States can be imported and exported with reduced or eliminated tariffs.\n\nAugutich purchased 70 000 tonnes of cement from Zambia at a total cost of US$9,659 999, and it contends that the only tax obligation since this was a COMESA certificate was 15% value added tax (VAT), which would have been the sum of US$ 1,448-999.\n\nHowever, on May 22 2025 to its surprise the finance minister instructed ZIMRA to implement the new tax regime even on cement purchased prior to the promulgated date.\n\nThe effect of this cumulatively is that the company is saddled with a tax obligation over time in the sum of US$1,448 999 the 30% surtax on the already purchased cement.\n\nThe company said not only is this unreasonable it is legally untenable as laws must never be applied retrospectively.\n\nAugutich had 50 haulage trucks that were in the process of bringing cement into Zimbabwe of cement purchased prior to May 16, 2025, ZIMRA then changed its system and demanded the said surtax.\n\nThe trucks have been stuck at Chirundu Border post since May 22, 2025 with negotiations with ZIMRA officials having collapsed.\n\nZIMRA, according to court papers, said the minister is the responsible authority.\n\nTo this end Augutich Investments filed an urgent chamber application with the High Court seeking a temporary interdict suspending the enforcement of a surtax of 30 % against it on white cement whether artificially coloured, introduced by the Customs and Excise (Surtax Tariff) (Amendment) Notice, 2025 (No.6).\n\nThe company through its Chief Executive Officer Levy Mashingaidze, and represented by Mugiya Law Chambers, is also seeking an order that the implementation of surtax 30% duty should not apply to cement purchased by the applicant prior to May 16, 2025.\n\nOn the return date, the company prays for an order which strikes out the surtax on the basis that it is inconsistent and in violation of section 3 Customs and Excise (Common Market For Eastern And Southern Africa) (Suspension) Regulations, 2000 Le 5.1. 244 of 2000.\n\nThe surtax law was introduced on 16th of May 2025, the enforcement was then done on the 22 of May 2025.\n\nIn the year 2000, government caused the promulgation of Customs and Excise (Common Market For Eastern And Southern Africa) (Suspension) Regulations, 2000, which provide for the exemption of duty/surtax on goods imported and exported between member states of the COMESA also known as the COMESA regulations.\n\nWith the coming into effect of the COMESA regulations and with the passage of time, the applicant being an importer of white cement and other cement related products would over the years import cement from Zambia for purposes of resale in Zimbabwe.\n\nWith Zambia being a COMESA Member State, the company would import the cement duty in accordance with the COMESA regulations.\n\nThe company started importing cement sometime in 2020 and has been doing so for a period of five years with the last such import being done on a monthly basis, the last of which was in February 2025.\n\nThe company purchased 70,000 tonnes of cement in Zambia last year.\n\nIt eventually applied for an Import Licence from the Ministry of Industry snd Commerce to import the said cement into Zimbabwe.\n\nThere were several legal issues and the applicant litigated with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce this culminated in a settlement, the effect of which is that over a period of just over a year the applicant was issued with an Import Permit for Cement.\n\nThe Deed Of Settlement was signed by the parties on May 14, 2025.\n\nWhilst in the process of ensuring that the cement consignment which the applicant had purchased is transported into Zimbabwe, Ncube without notice to the stakeholders and the applicant, proceeded to issue Customs and Excise (Surtax Tariff) (Amendment) Notice, 2025 (No.6) through S1. 50A of 2025, whose effect was to introduce some surtax, Mashingaidze said in his founding affidavit accompanying the application.\n\nThere was now additional duty on cement, this was done without prior warning or a grace period by the minister.\n\nThe applicant is of the view that the requirement for it to pay 30% surtax on cement imported from the COMESA region is unlawful or inconsistent with the dictates of the section 3 of the COMESA regulations which clearly exempt the applicant from paying surtax.\n\nI must also advise the court that the importation of Cement is regulated by the Ministry Of Industry and Commerce through the issuance of Import Licences; this is obviously meant to protect the local industry and products from being overrun by imports.\n\nThe financial prejudice which applicant is suffering and continues to suffer is massive; the haulage trucks that were hired are now currently in transit .\n\nThe applicant has further shown that it contracted a different transporter to ship its cement from Zambia at a cost which is likely to blow out of its budget on account of demurrage,he said.\n\nThe matter is yet to be heard.\n\n",

These will be at the intersection of Simon Mazorodze and Willowvale Roads, as well as Simon Mazorodze and Remembrance Drive.\n\nMnangagwa also said four more interchanges will be built at busy road points across Harare, including Mabvuku Junction, several spots along Harare Drive, and at major traffic circles like Westgate and Kuwadzana.\n\nAdditionally, four interchanges will also be constructed at the Mabvuku Junction; Harare Drive/Mutare Road; Harare Drive/Liberation Legacy Way; Nemakonde Way/Harare Drive; Sam Nujoma/Harare Drive; Westgate Traffic Circle; Kuwadzana Traffic Circle and Churchill/Liberation Way, Mnangagwa said.\n\nHe also added that nine junctions along Harare and Bulawayo Airport Roads will also be upgraded, and smart traffic systems will be used to improve traffic flow and road discipline.\n\nNine junctions shall be updated as part of the J. M. Nkomo Road (RGM International Airport Road) upgrade to grade separation structures.\n\nIn addition, smart traffic management systems are now also in place and will be deployed towards optimising traffic flow through intelligent systems. The roll out of these systems must be publicised and see greater discipline on our roads.Although the long-delayed project is now complete, its high cost reported at US$88 million has sparked public and parliamentary debate, with calls for an audit to clarify how the funds were used, as many accuse the government of massive looting.\n\n",

Though she initially knew little about farming, her small subsistence plot now thrives.\n\nOther farms failed or were abandoned, with some new tenants unschooled in agriculture and others  including politicians who were handed land  uninterested.\n\nThere were food shortages and Zimbabwe soon required international aid.\n\nThere was a bit of a tough period through the 2000s and, unfortunately, I think it sort of refuelled racial tensions to an extent, Burger told AFP.\n\nBut being so passionate about farming was the motivator for me to move forward, he said.\n\nMupambawashe moved to the area from the southern city of Bulawayo, around 200 kilometres (125 miles) away.\n\nWhen we first came here in 2001, it was a forest and there was nothing built, she said.Some of the white farmers were angry but we managed to talk to each other in good faith and move forward.\n\nThey never let us down and said, You grabbed the farm, lets see if you can do it. But instead they brought their own tractors and equipment to come and help, which we felt was a nice gesture.\n\nIt was hard in the beginning, especially after irrigation equipment was stolen, and the early failures were embarrassing, Mupambawashe said.\n\nBut today her plot does so well that she only needs to buy in sugar and cooking oil.\n\nBurger leases land from her and lends tractors and expertise.\n\nHis familys land was among the few hundreds that were not seized in the 2000s.\n\nNonetheless, For a long time we became wound up in compensation, said Burger, vice-president of the Commercial Farmers Union of Zimbabwe (CFU) that represents mostly white farmers.\n\nBut it wasnt our purpose. Our purpose was driving agriculture and current agricultural affairs forward, he said.\n\nThis year, some farm owners whose land was confiscated received the first compensation payments after decades of waiting.\n\nThe process has been complex and divisive.\n\nThe government committed to compensation as part of an effort to settle arrears and reform the economy in order to be able to regain access to international credit lines cut two decades ago.\n\nIt announced in 2020 the creation of a fund that would pay out US$3.5 billion for infrastructure on farms but not the land, which it says was taken by force by colonial settlers.\n\nUnable to raise cash, the government in 2023 changed the offer to one percent in cash and the remainder in US dollar denominated treasury bonds.\n\nIn April, the first payments were made to 378 of 780 farmers approved for this scheme.\n\nDeon Theron, who represents the Compensation Steering Committee group of former white farmers, says the introduction of the bonds has annulled the original deal and negotiations need to start over.\n\nThe bonds are unsecured and there is limited recourse in the event of non-performance by government, he told AFP.\n\nThe general feeling amongst the farmers is firstly frustration that after 20-odd years we still have not received anything, Theron said.\n\nBut the Property and Farm Compensation Associationsaid its members would take what is on offer.\n\nThe bonds are under international guarantee, said leader Harry Orphanides, adding that digging in and seeking more from the government would be futile.\n\n",
