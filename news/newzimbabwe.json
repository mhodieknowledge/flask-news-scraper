            "content": "By Xinhua\n\nTHE World Bank (WB) has warned that climate change could erode up to 12 percent of Zimbabwes gross domestic product (GDP) annually if the country does not implement robust measures to tackle the phenomenon.\n\nIn its latest Zimbabwe economic update report launched Friday in Harare, Zimbabwes capital, the WB urged Zimbabwe to bolster resilience against climate-related shocks, focusing on agriculture as a critical pillar of the economy.\n\nStatistics from the Zimbabwean government show agriculture contributes from 11 percent to 14 percent of GDP and provides employment for some 70 percent of the population and about 60 percent of all raw materials for the industry.\n\nThe countrys heavy reliance on rain-fed systems and maize production, however, leaves it vulnerable to increasingly severe climate events, the WB noted.\n\nIn the 2023/2024 farming season, Zimbabwe experienced a severe El Nino-induced drought, resulting in a 60 percent decline in maize yield compared to the five-year average.\n\nThe significant reduction in rainfall, coupled with high temperatures, has led to widespread food insecurity and economic hardship.\n\nThe WB observed that the governments ambitious target to boost agricultural output to 12.5 billion U.S. dollars by 2025 is under threat due to climate-induced challenges.\n\nClimate shocks disrupt GDP, trade balances, and fiscal stability. The 2023/2024 El Nino-induced drought alone caused approximately 363 million U.S. dollars in damage losses, the WB said.\n\nThis cycle of drought and recovery undermines sustainable development and exacerbates poverty levels, making it imperative to enhance the resilience of the agricultural sector, said Easther Chigumira, World Bank senior agriculture specialist and co-author of the report.\n\nShe said to strengthen Zimbabwes resilience to weather shocks and climate change, a dual approach is essential, involving substantial investment in climate adaptation and the enhancement of anticipatory actions.\n\nThe report, titled Improving Resilience to Weather Shocks and Climate Change, highlighted the opportunity for Zimbabwe to strengthen resilience to climate shocks and further boost economic growth.\n\n",
