The fight has been ongoing since November 2020 and today, the Chief Resident Magistrate Court in Lilongwe has today ruled for their extradition to South Africa andthat the couple remain in custody until they are handed over to South African authorities.\n\nHowever, the legal battle is far from over. The case is expected to move to the High Court and could ultimately reach the Supreme Court of Appeal.\n\nDespite the ruling, the Bushiris lawyer, Wapona Kita, has requested bail for the couple, arguing that the extradition order should be paused. The state has not objected to the bail request, leaving the court to decide on the matter.\n\nBushiris dramatic escape from South Africa in November 2020 remains a mystery. It was widely speculated that he and his wife used President Lazarus Chakweras presidential plane to flee.\n\nThe aircraft was subjected to rigorous searches by South African authorities before Chakwera was allowed to depart for Malawi. The circumstances surrounding their escape continue to raise questions.\n\n",

However, for the first time, during Nadias disappearance, he showed up, taking pictures and posting them on social media in a celebratory mode.\n\nThat is extremely primitive at a time when we are searching for a woman who has invested so much in a national development, Mupambi said.\n\nIn a statement, police spokesperson Commissioner Paul Nyathi said the information is misleading.\n\nThe information is misleading the public on the exact position on the ground and police investigations.\n\nVongai Nadia Mabvirakure is a suspect in a case of contravening Section 113 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, Chapter 9: 23, Theft of trust property.\n\nThe complainant is Tichabaiwa Gwadu, who represents Matiza Foundation.\n\nIn September 2024, the suspect, through her company, Green Rebirth Trust, went into a partnership with Matiza Foundation to construct a greenhouse or shed net at Chomupunga Business Centre, Murewa, Nyathi said.\n\nAccording to ZRP, Mabvirakure was given US$15,200 cash to acquire the required materials based on her quotation.\n\nInstead of paying cash to Brickforce Hardware, Murewa, the suspect converted the money to personal use and went on to acquire the building materials on credit using false pretence under Matiza Foundation.\n\nBrickforce management later contacted Matiza Foundation Company, raising a complaint and demanding payments.\n\nA report was then made at ZRP Murewa, Nyathi said.\n\nNyathi added that a team from CID Murewa checked for the suspect at her known address in Chitungwiza on 05th March 2025.\n\nThey failed to locate her. They were told by her son, Patrick Mabvirakure that his mother was away.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police has since located the suspect. She is currently in hospital under Police Guard, he said.\n\nNyathi said full-scale investigations are currently underway in relation to the Theft of trust property case and her familys allegations.\n\nLinda Masarira, who was part of the Mabvirakures search party, shot back at Nyathi, accusing him of lying.\n\n@PoliceZimbabwe are you not ashamed of lying to the world. I spent the day looking for a safe hospital for Nadia. When police officers came to get her statement, I was there and they couldnt because she is disoriented. Why Mr Nyathi are you not doing due diligence and publishing falsehoods.

He was initially diagnosed with lymphoma in 2019, but for the last six months he was also struggling with pneumonia.\n\nMalvia revealed that during his final months the reggae star remained in good spirits, sharing: He was definitely very brave. He was positive throughout it all. About three weeks ago when he was admitted in the hospital he asked if I was worried and I said I am always worried. He told me not to worry because everything was going to be all right. He was always very hopeful.\n\nFollowing Cocoa Teas death, Jamaican Minister of Culture, Gender, Entertainment and Sport, Olivia Grange also spoke to the publication, and shared that she was very saddened by the passing of Sweet Sweet Cocoa Tea.\n\nMinister Grange added: He has been a staple in the industry for so long. He is one of the greatest reggae singers who has ever lived and his work will stand the test of time. We salute him at this time  condolences to his family.\n\nIt has been a pleasure working with him over these years and we are glad that we had the opportunity to give him some of flowers while he was here with us. May his soul rest in peace.\n\nOn X, formerly known asTwitter, others rushed to honour Cocoa Tea  who started out in music aged just 14 and had hits including Rocking Dolly, Rikers Island, and I Lost My Sonia.\n\nMany of Scotts songs were attributed to influencing Jamaican culture and the youth, sharing his Rastafarian morals and encouraging young people to stay in education and work.\n\nGrammy Award-winning reggae artist Morgan Heritage wrote: May your light never fade away big brother.

Unlike the trend for the month-on-month inflation, there was no sudden drop in the trend for year-on-year inflation, as the February USD inflation rate is showing an upward trend.\n\nThe increase in the year-on-year inflation is a cause of concern and underlines the need for US$ inflation stabilisation measures to be prioritised, for example, stopping the enforcement of the exchange rate regime by the FIU, said the industry lobby groups inflation developments tracker.\n\nMarket watchers contend that the rise in US$ inflation is largely influenced by traders habit of evading tight ZWG official rate pricing, which forces them to increase greenback prices to create room for pegging higher local currency prices at premiums that are not far from the parallel market rates.\n\nThe inflation movements confirm that USD inflation is influenced by ZiG inflation, as retailers adjust their prices in line with ZiG prices to avoid prosecution by RBZs Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for using the parallel market rates, said CZI.\n\nDespite acknowledging the positive impact of the current easing of month-on-month inflation rates to 0.5% for February 2025, the industry said a month-on-month inflation rate of below 1% is crucial to instilling confidence in monetary policy.\n\nWhile the overall month-on-month inflation is still low at only 0.5%, there are still some high-inflation products in the food basket. High-inflation products include sport equipment (7%), information (6%), university fees (4%), and fruits (4%) among others, added CZI.\n\n",
