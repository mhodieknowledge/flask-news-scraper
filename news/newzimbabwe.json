            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nPOLITICAL analyst Rejoice Ngwenya has poured cold water on wealthy businessman Kuda Tagwireis chances of succeeding President Emmerson Mnangagwa, saying the tycoon-turned-politician lacks a political power base to challenge for the highest office.\n\nNgwenyas remarks follow widespread speculation President Emmerson Mnangagwas faction was preparing the businessman for takeover as president following resistance within the ruling party for the incumbent to run for a third successive term, which violates the countrys Constitution.\n\nThis is a simplistic, if not naive, narrative. Zanu PF has no succession strategy. They rely on populist gravitas, and I can tell you Tagwirei has no grassroots credibility.\n\nIt would be catastrophic for ED [Emmerson Mnangagwa] to present him as a 2028 candidate. And besides, who really likes ED in the Central Committee? Which provinces would vote for Tagwirei in that party? said Ngwenya.\n\nTagwirei has unsettled a faction pushing for President Mnangagwas deputy, Constantino Chiwenga, to takeover when the 82-year-old Zanu PF leader retires in 2028 upon expiry of his second and final presidential term as per constitutional limits.\n\nThere are three factions in Zanu PF: the ED faction, the Chiwenga faction, and the neutral, non-committal, unsure faction. Definitely, the Chiwenga faction will say nobut we know how powerful it is. If it can shift attitudes in the military, then it has the capacity to hold sway, said Ngwenya.\n\nTagwirei has, in recent times, emerged from nowhere, criss-crossing the country presiding over Zanu PF-organised events thereby fuelling speculation of his ambitions to succeed President Mnangagwa.\n\nTo demonstrate the tensions within Zanu PF, Tagwirei was reportedly ejected, at Chiwengas behest, from this weeks Zanu PF Central Committee meeting in Harare ostensibly for not having followed proper procedures to ratify his membership to the all-powerful Zanu PF organ. He was forced out alongside other new coopted members from other provinces, sources said.\n\nTagwirei arrived at the Central Committee gathering at Zanu PF Headquarters on Thursday with opulence and a spring in his step, only to fail to see the meeting through.\n\nThe businessman, who was endorsed by the Harare Province led by Goodwills Masimirembwa, attended the indaba unaware of the partys procedures and statutes.\n\nDespite his name having been seconded by the provincial structure, it required ratification by the Central Committee to confirm his co-option into the most powerful organ of Zanu PF.\n\nAccording to political observers, his attendance at the Central Committee meeting exposed his ignorance regarding the ruling partys procedures.\n\nTagwireis supersonic ascension in Zanu PF has been met with mixed feelings among the general membership.\n\n",

They parcelled out the large tracts of land basing on a deed of settlement with the then Ministry of Lands and Rural Resettlement to transfer the 1,057ha farm.But over the years, CFI Holdings has insisted that they still own the property culminating in endless legal battles.After obtaining a court victory in 2023, CFI was blocked from issuing eviction orders after a group of the land occupiers approached the courts seeking to reverse the ownership.Presenting the CFI financials this week, the group revealed that they finally scored victory with the highest court on the land, and will now deliberate on the next course of action to be adopted.In February 2023, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Crest Breeders International, confirming the entitys rights in Saturday Retreat Estate.In the current year, the Constitutional Court dismissed a challenge to the Supreme Courts ruling brought by the land barons. The entity remains seized with formulating a development strategy as the group looks to enhance its synergies with the retail unit and diversify its portfolio, said CFI.The future of families residing on the property now remains at the mercy of the bonafide owners, leaving a very high possibility of evictions if the farm owners think otherwise.Securing low cost housing remains a dream for thousands of Harares citizens as the local authority has failed to come up with such a plan for decades.Resultantly, desperate home seekers continue to fall prey to dishonest housing cooperatives and land barons.\n\nThe latest development contained in CFI Holdings Financial Statements for the period ended March 31, 2025, triggers chills down the spines of property owners, who have resided on the property for decades.\n\nHarare South Saturday Retreat Farm, widely known as Ushehwekunze is owned by Crest Breeders, a unit under CFI Holdings.The ownership wrangle of the property has raged on for years, with some land barons allegedly duping thousands of home seekers of their hard earned money.

Both women died at the scene, he said.The British Foreign Office said it was supporting the family of a British woman who had died in Zambia and was liaising with local authorities.Mr Mweemba said the two women were part of a guided safari group who were walking in the park on Thursday when the elephant charged towards them at high speed.The two tourists had stayed for four days at the Big Lagoon Camp, about 600 km (370 miles) from the capital, Lusaka, where the attack happened.They were moving to other camps when the elephant charged from behind.
