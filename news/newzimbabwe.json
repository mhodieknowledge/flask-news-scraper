The actual daily generation is roughly half of that.\n\n",

            "content": "AP\n\nBatsirai Pabwe picked detergents, toothpaste, snacks and some pasta among several grocery items spread on the tarmac of a car parking space  an unorthodox night bazaar lit by cellphone flashlights and fluorescent lamps inZimbabwescapital, Harare.\n\nTraditional stores are struggling to survive as the volatility ofZimbabwes new currency pushes prices up. Many like Pabwe now shun them for much cheaper informal markets that pop up at night to avoid the glare of authorities.\n\nFrom dusk, sidewalks, store or office verandahs and car parking spaces burst into unorthodox open air bazaars, offering anything from groceries to fresh meat, electronics, clothes, medicines, fashion accessories and stationery.\n\nUnfettered by expenses such as rising energy costs, taxes and laws that force formal retailers to accept the local currency at artificially low official exchange rates, informal traders, including children, offer better bargains. A box of juice that sells for $3 in a supermarket costs half of that on the street.\n\nIts my first time shopping here. My friend told me that its much cheaper than the supermarkets, 30-year-old Pabwe said, visibly relieved as he filled up a plastic bag with items for just $20. I decided to give it a try and I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe once-prosperous southern African nation of 15 million people in April introduced a new gold-backed currency called ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, to replace one that had been battered by depreciation and often outright rejection by the people.\n\nIt is the countrys sixth attempt at a new currency since the spectacular 2009 collapse of the Zimbabwe dollar and adoption of the U.S. dollar as legal tender amid hyperinflation of 5 billion percent, one of the worlds worst currency crashes to date. The U.S. dollar has since remained legal tender alongside successive local currencies.\n\nThe latest currency, the worlds newest, came with pomp and fanfare  promotional catchy jingles and songs played repeatedly on public radio, television and online.\n\nSeven months on, the ZiG seems to be tanking, like its predecessors. The gap between official and black market exchange rates continues to widen, with many people and informal traders who dominate the economy again preferring the more stable dollar.\n\nTraditional stores, forced by authorities to charge using the local currency, are increasing prices to make ends meet. But they have also become uncompetitive against unregulated informal markets, the Retailers Association of Zimbabwe, an industry representative group, said in September.\n\nIt warned of store closures, saying the situation is clearly untenable.\n\nIn October, Pick n Pay, one of Africas biggest grocery chains that operates more than 70 stores jointly with a local partner in Zimbabwe, said that it had impaired its investment in Zimbabwe to a book value of zero because of the deteriorating economic conditions.\n\nIn every transaction business is doing in the formal setup, its making an exchange rate loss that cannot be compensated. The major issue here is a currency crisis, said Gift Mugano, an economics professor. Huge overheads worsen the retailers situation.\n\nEverything is against their survival. The informal sector works at night, (if there is) no electricity they use their phones, they dont care. They are there for survival, Mugano said.\n\nThe contrast is palpable in Harares Central Business District, where only a few shoppers solemnly scanned prices in a supermarket on a recent day.\n\nSoothing music played from speakers inside but was drowned out by the buzz created outside by hordes of street vendors shouting out bargains to a sea of shoppers.\n\nBusiness is booming, said Oswald Gari, a vendor, adding that he only works at night when the police leave.\n\nGari, 51, said hes fending for his six children and four nephews under his care from the night trade. He harbors no hope of finding formal employment in a country where once roaring industrial sites are being turned into giant warehouses for imported goods, many which end up on the streets, and rail tracks are now overgrown with weeds.\n\nMore than 80% of Zimbabwes employable population ekes out a living in the informal sector, according to official figures and the International Labor Organization.\n\nFor Pabwe, shopping from the informal night markets means less headaches.\n\nIts quite confusing, especially for people like me who really dont understand the value of the ZiG. I always get confused when I get into supermarkets, he said.\n\nHe was satisfied with his shopping at night bazaar.\n\nI got everything I was looking for and the pricing is really affordable. I actually managed to buy a handful for just $20. I even got my washing powder and dishwashing liquid, he said. I think I will do this more often.\n\n",

            "content": "AP\n\nAngelina JolieandBrad Pitthave reached a divorce settlement, her lawyer said Monday, bringing an apparent end to one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history.\n\nJolies attorney James Simon confirmed to The Associated Press that the couple had come to a deal. News of the settlement was first reported by People magazine.\n\nMore than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt, Simon said in a statement. She and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\n\nNo court documents have been filed yet, and a judge will need to sign off on the agreement. An email late Monday night to Pitts attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.\n\nJolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, were among Hollywoods most prominent couples for 12 years. The two Oscar winners have six children together.\n\nJoliefiled for divorce in 2016,after a private jet flight from Europe during which she said Pitt was abusive toward her and their children. A judge in 2019declared them divorced and single,but the splitting of assets and child custody needed to be separately settled.\n\nA private judge that the two had hired to handle the case reached a decision soon after that included equal custody of their children, but Joliefiled to have him removedfrom the case over an unreported conflict of interest. An appeals court agreed, the judge was removed, and the couple had to start over.\n\nNo details of the agreement were immediately revealed, and the couples use of the private judge  an increasingly common move among splitting celebrities in recent years  has kept the proceedings largely under wraps. Some details, however, have been revealed through a separate lawsuit filed by Pitt, in which he alleged Jolie reneged on an agreement that she would sell him her half of a French winery the two owned together. Its not clear how the divorce agreement will affect that lawsuit.\n\n",

Not only because I was used to her presence, but I love my children John and Minana INCREDIBLY. However, our marriage faced IRRECONCILABLE differences that made it impossible to continue. She struggled to get along with my family, including my DEAR late mother and all my 6 sisters, and the constant fighting became too overwhelming for me. It reached a point where I felt that the person I was fighting for was not making an effort to support me when the world had turned its back on me. This made the marriage IRRETRIEVABLY broken down. Despite these challenges, she remains a GREAT mother and a good person, and I continue to look after her exceptionally well and respect her as such.\n\nWe now co-parent very well and I ensure that my children are well taken care of. Women are good at playing the victim and will never publicly acknowledge a mans efforts. For instance, I recently paid TWO MILLION rand for their Christmas holiday, where they travelled to Vietnam and Japan and on top of that, I gave her an additional ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS USD cash for their shopping and for her to share with her family, reads part of his post.\n\nSonja took no time to respond, lashing out at her ex-husband for always making noise on the internet adding that they had not seen each other in 7 months.\n\nIn a series of Instagram stories, she said, I dont care who you marry. Marry and move on\n\nRespect your business partners, respect the offices you go in. Why are you always making noise on the internet? Arent you supposed to at church? Arent you supposed to be at kuMasowe?\n\n",
