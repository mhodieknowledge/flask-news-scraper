            "content": "Xinhua\n\nThe Southern African Development Community (SADC) should reassess its trade partnerships to maximize benefits in the face of rising U.S. trade tariffs and the withdrawal of traditional development support, a senior official said Thursday.\n\nSpeaking at the 34th Meeting of the Committee of Ministers of Trade and the 24th Meeting of the Ministerial Task Force on Regional Economic Integration in Harare, Zimbabwes capital, SADC Executive Secretary Elias Magosi said the changing global tariff landscape had redefined trade dynamics, prompting the region to adopt pragmatic and strategic responses.\n\nWe must shape and determine our destiny going forward and swiftly attain robust negotiation skills that enable us to define trade and related aspects on our terms and for our benefit, Magosi said.\n\nHe noted that most SADC member states that previously benefited from the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), a U.S. trade program granting duty-free access to African countries, stand to lose significantly following the blanket 10 percent tariff the United States is considering imposing on all imported goods.\n\nFurther, the uncertainty over whether AGOA will be renewed this September compounds the existing challenge. I firmly believe that these recent geopolitical developments should serve as a powerful wake-up call for our region, a call for us to unite, cooperate, and integrate more, he said.\n\nMagosi expressed deep concern over low inter-regional trade within SADC, which stands at 18 percent, despite the establishment of the SADC Free Trade Area (FTA) in 2008.\n\nThe full implementation of the SADC FTA by all SADC member states remains critical in ensuring enhanced market access, leveraging on the gains from trade to grow our economies, Magosi said.\n\nThe SADC is a 16-member regional bloc, comprising Angola, Botswana, the Comoros, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nPRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa has said the controversial takeover of waste management by Geo Pomona in Harare will enhance the sector, an area in which the City Council had failed.\n\nMnangagwa made the remarks in Harare, Thursday while commissioning the waste sorting plant and refuse collection trucks at the Geo Pomona Waste Management facility.\n\nThe commissioning of the sorting plant, 45 refuse trucks, and 100 skip bins comes amid uproar from residents associations over Geo Pomonas takeover of waste collection, which will cost Harare City Council millions of dollars.\n\nResidents have questioned the opaque tripartite agreement between Geo Pomona, the Harare City Council, and the Ministry of Local Government, arguing that the arrangement was made with no prior consultation.\n\nHowever, Mnangagwa, in his address, insisted that Geo Pomona would improve waste collection in the capital.\n\nTo date, the waste collection crisis, particularly in the capital city of Harare, has had dire consequences, ranging from environmental degradation to public health risks, among other negative impacts. We have seen outbreaks of diseasesa situation that is wholly unacceptable. Such conditions must become a thing of the past.\n\nTherefore, in line with Vision 2030, my Government continues to prioritise the creation of clean, safe, and modern urban environments, which are engines of economic growth. Cleanliness and the efficient management of service delivery are not just indicators of good governance but also essential benchmarks for a nations competitiveness, said Mnangagwa.\n\nGeo Pomona, which was tasked with refuse collection earlier this year in an arrangement spearheaded by the Minister of Local Government, Daniel Garwe, is yet to fully fulfil its mandate.\n\nPiles of uncollected refuse in residential areas remain a sore sight months after the companys takeover.\n\nThis has angered residents, who have cast doubt on the impact of Geo Pomonas operations, despite the governments prior praise for the waste management initiative.\n\nFurther fuelling residents frustration is the US$40 per tonne that the City Council will pay Geo Pomona for waste disposal. The company is expected to collect 650 tonnes daily once operations are in full swing.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa said the Harare model should be replicated in other local authorities.\n\nThrough the purchase of this equipment, we must see the waste management system being capacitated to efficiently and consistently collect waste across all parts of Harare.\n\nI urge sector players in other towns and cities to take a leaf from such initiatives towards improving waste management in our country, he said.\n\n",

Even if it means leaving her family in Zimbabwe to become a live-in care worker in the UK.\n\nNow, halfway across the world from everyone she loves, Ruby works round the clock to make enough money to bring her family together again.\n\nBeing a live-in care worker for seniors in the UK is hard work. It involves lifting people in and out of bed all day, feeding them and sometimes changing their diapers. All that while keeping on top of their housework too.\n\nFor Ruby, a 30-year-old mother of three from Zimbabwe, this wasnt her dream job, but that didnt matter. She was determined to give her kids a better life. So she sacrificed her career as a teacher and left her kids back home in Zimbabwe to become a care worker in the UK.\n\nRuby wont let anything stand in the way of getting her kids and husband to England, where they can receive free education and healthcare, things she doesnt have in Zimbabwe. But therealquestion is: Can Ruby sustain the punishing routine long enough to pull it off?\n\nGreener Pastures, a podcast episode byRadio Workshop, captures the highs and lows of Rubys mission: the intimate relationship she built with her client, the joy of her husbands first day of work in the UK and the madness of working opposite shifts. And not least, Rubys momentous trip home to get the kids.\n\nWhen Ruby arrived in the UK in January 2024, she quickly learnt that the real England is far from the romanticised version people have back home.\n\nWhile not exactly the greener pastures she expected, her visa offered her the opportunity to earn pounds. After struggling to support her family on a teachers salary in Zimbabwe, that meant everything to her.\n\nRubys first job involved providing round-the-clock care to a woman in her nineties. She was paid to work eight hours a day, but it was a 24-hour job. She says sometimes shed call her friends just to cry.\n\nBut Ruby says she was lucky. The woman she was caring for was kind and did everything she could to make Ruby feel at home. Not like the horror stories Ruby heard from colleagues about being spat on by racist clients.\n\nBut arguably, the biggest challenge will begin with the start of their family life in the UK. Ruby explained: In a year or two, [the kids are] going to be different people. But, I am there to remind them of their roots.\n\n",

Some 47,000 farmers have accessed US markets while more than 500,000 have received antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) from its arm, the Presidents Emergency Fund for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR).\n\nDespite past attempts to thaw relations with America, Zimbabwe has always been found wanting whenever its human rights record is analysed. Arrest of journalists, the continued use of lengthy pre-trial detention as a weapon against dissenting voices, abductions and torture by the secret service have always been brought up.\n\nGrand corruption within the government, headed by Zanu PF-aligned businessmen and a clear disregard to fix the graft have also been raised as red flags.\n\nThis latest attempt at mending relations between the two countries comes barely a month after President Emmerson Mnangagwa announced the suspension of all tariffs on goods being imported from the US in an attempt to court re-elected President Donald Trump.\n\nAdded Murwira: Zimbabwe looks forward to deepening relations and expansion of bilateral cooperation with the USA we appreciate the participation of the USA through its embassy at the 2025 edition of Zimbabwe International Trade Fair (ZITF). We thank you for that participation.\n\nWe applaud all USA companies that have established businesses in Zimbabwe, we would like to assure all these and foreign companies in Zimbabwe that the Zimbabwean government is willing to assist them to expand their operations.\n\nAmericas Independence Day was commemorated earlier in Harare as a significant number of its embassy staff are being redeployed, according to Ambassador Pamela Tremont. America will be celebrating 249 years of Independence on July 4.\n\n",
