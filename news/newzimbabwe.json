            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA NAMIBIAN delegation is in Zimbabwe on a benchmarking mission aimed at strengthening cooperation in Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) with a particular focus on diamond cutting and polishing at Zimbabwes only Diamond Training Centre.\n\nThe delegation, led by Namibia Training Authority (NTA) Chief Operations Officer Penda Shilongo and Zimbabwean government officials visited polytechnics across the country, Chinhoyi University of Technology, Diamond Training Centre and the Zimbabwe School of Mines among other training institutions.The purpose of the visit is to learn from Zimbabwes experience in developing skills for mineral beneficiation and industrial value addition.Speaking during the visit to the Diamond Training Centre, an indigenous-owned institute based in Harare, Shilongo said Namibia wanted to draw lessons from Zimbabwes model of transforming natural resource wealth into employment through practical skills development.What we take home is that we need to start with mineral beneficiation in our country. At the moment, we do not have a training facility that offers these types of skills. We see this as an opportunity to collaborate and leverage the expertise of our sister country so that we can also add value to our mineral resources in Namibia, Shilongo said.He added that Namibia was eager to strengthen bilateral cooperation with Zimbabwe, particularly in upskilling trainers and aligning TVET standards across the SADC region.We invite our Zimbabwean counterparts to visit Namibia to identify areas where we can also assist each other. There is a lot to learn from one another, he said.The NTA, which regulates the countrys TVET system, is implementing reforms to bridge gaps in technical training and align courses with emerging industries such as green energy.Richard Kambinda, acting general manager for TVET and VTC development support, said Zimbabwes capacity in vocational training was impressive and that the visit would help Namibia build stronger foundations for technical education.We came to Zimbabwe on a study tour to see what programmes can help us bridge the gaps we have in Namibia, Kambinda said.We dont have a diamond-cutting college back home, so its important to learn from our brothers and sisters here. Weve seen that Zimbabwe has the capacity and we believe Zimbabwe can help us.The visit is part of a broader agenda to finalise a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two countries, focusing on dual certification, curriculum development, trainers capacity building, quality assurance, Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) integration, and SADC TVET harmonisation.Diamond Training Centre founder and director Lovemore Kurotwi said the visit was a significant recognition of Zimbabwes growing influence in technical skills transfer and beneficiation training.We are a private, indigenous-owned institution, and I am grateful to our government and the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education for licensing and recognising our pivotal role in this economy, Kurotwi said.We are transferring vital skills to our young people, which is key to building an industrialised nation.He said the institutes mission is to transform Zimbabwe from an exporter of raw minerals to a manufacturer of finished products.We complain about unemployment, yet we have all the resources. The missing link is skills. Without skills, there is no industry to talk about, he said. That is why our thrust is on training and skills transfer. When another government comes to benchmark us, it shows we are on the right path.The diamond training institute plays a strategic role in Zimbabwes mineral beneficiation agenda by equipping students with expertise in diamond cutting, polishing, grading, and valuation skills once exclusive to foreign operators.Kurotwi said the Namibian delegations tour shows growing continental cooperation in vocational education, as African nations increasingly seek to localise value addition and empower their youth through hands-on technical skills.Meanwhile, despite having a beneficiation policy, Zimbabwe still exports raw minerals.The country continues to train personnel, most of whom end up leaving because there is no beneficiation industry.\n\nThe delegation, led by Namibia Training Authority (NTA) Chief Operations Officer Penda Shilongo and Zimbabwean government officials visited polytechnics across the country, Chinhoyi University of Technology, Diamond Training Centre and the Zimbabwe School of Mines among other training institutions.\n\nThe purpose of the visit is to learn from Zimbabwes experience in developing skills for mineral beneficiation and industrial value addition.Speaking during the visit to the Diamond Training Centre, an indigenous-owned institute based in Harare, Shilongo said Namibia wanted to draw lessons from Zimbabwes model of transforming natural resource wealth into employment through practical skills development.What we take home is that we need to start with mineral beneficiation in our country.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nWOES continue to mount for jailed businessmen Mike Chimombe and Moses Mpofu, with the State now seeking to confiscate their properties following their conviction in a US$7 million fraud case.\n\nThe duo, who face a possible minimum 20-year jail term if convicted, will now be sentenced on November 17 after the State indicated its intention to apply for a confiscation order under Section 50(1) of the Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Act [Chapter 9:24].The law empowers authorities to trace, seize, and confiscate assets suspected to have been acquired through criminal activity.Prosecutors believe some of Mpofu and Chimombes properties were bought using proceeds of the goat tender fraud.We had given notice in terms of section 50(1) of the Money Laundering Act, said prosecutor Whispher Mabhaudhi while seeking a postponement of the case on Friday.Mabhaudhi said the States application is ready but has been delayed pending the uploading of the courts written judgment.Once the judgment is uploaded, then the State will file its application, he added.Justice Pisirayi Kwenda, who convicted the pair, said their separate judgments would be available by next Wednesday.The two are expected back in court on November 14 for pre-sentencing proceedings.Sentencing is expected on November 17.Mpofu and Chimombe were found guilty last week after spending over a year in remand prison.The State proved that the fraud emanated from false documents submitted through their company, Blackdeck Private Limited, in September 2021, when the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture invited bids for the supply of 632,001 goats worth US$87 million under a national livestock pass-on scheme.After winning the tender, the contract was instead signed by Blackdeck Livestock and Poultry Farming, an unregistered entity, with Mpofu representing the company and Chimombe acting as a witness.Investigations revealed that Blackdeck Private Limited had no valid tax clearance certificate from the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA), and that the QR code on its National Social Security Authority (NSSA) compliance certificate belonged to another firm, Skywalk Investments.Relying on these misrepresentations, the ministry paid ZWL$1.6 billionthen equivalent to US$7.7 millionin two instalments on April 21 and June 29, 2022.When the company failed to deliver, it falsely claimed to have mobilised 32,500 goats across provinces, but verification showed only 3,713 goats were available.After the Ministry of Lands realised that they were being deceived by the accused persons, they then cancelled the contract on August 29, 2022, said the National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ).To date, only 4,208 goats worth US$331,445.25 have been delivered, leaving the government prejudiced of US$7,380,751.85.\n\nThe duo, who face a possible minimum 20-year jail term if convicted, will now be sentenced on November 17 after the State indicated its

We will announce by Monday at the latest; it should be Tuesday, said Magwizi.\n\nThe post became vacant after Michael Nees was dismissed due to a string of poor results, leaving the national team without a coach just two weeks before the November FIFA international break.\n\nSources say the online application portal, which closed Thursday, drew a stampede of interest, with over 300 curriculum vitae submitted. Among the notable applicants is former Tottenham Hotspur, Newcastle United, and Ghana national team manager Chris Hughton, who is said to be among the frontrunners.\n\nZIFA has set a minimum requirement of a CAF or UEFA Pro License, effectively ruling out local coaches, none of whom currently hold such qualifications.\n\nThe new coach will immediately begin preparations for the Warriors upcoming friendly matches against Algeria on November 13 in Saudi Arabia, and Qatar four days later as part of the build-up to the Africa Cup of Nations (AFCON) scheduled for December 2025.\n\n",

He was not asked to plead and was released on US$200 bail pending trial.\n\nAccording to the State, the incident occurred on October 25 when the complainant, a socialite, was having drinks with friends at La Parada Restaurant before they later moved to Karma Night Club in the capital.\n\nProsecutors said while at the club, the complainant went to the bathroom and, on her return, found her friends had left. Nyakudya was reportedly standing at the table with another woman.\n\nShe then picked up her glass and continued drinking while looking for her friends, the State outline reads. From that moment, the complainant could not remember what happened next and only woke up at Chisipite shops covered with a cloth.\n\nAccording to the court papers, bystanders at Chisipite told her she had been dumped by a moving vehicle, but they were unable to capture the cars registration number as it sped away.\n\nShe later realised that her handbag, an iPhone 14 Pro Max, US$1,200 cash, and wig were missing.

            "content": "BBC\n\nThe Trump administration will limit the number of refugees admitted to the US to 7,500 over the next year, and give priority to white South Africans.\n\nThe move, announced in a notice published on Thursday, marks a dramatic cut from the previous limit of 125,000 set by former President Joe Biden and will bring the cap to a record low.\n\nNo reason was given for the cut, but the notice said it was justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.\n\nIn January, Trump signed an executive order suspending the US Refugee Admissions Programme, or USRAP, which he said would allow US authorities to prioritise national security and public safety.\n\nThe previous lowest refugee admissions cap was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.\n\nThe notice posted to the website of the Federal Register said the 7,500 admissions would primarily be allocated to Afrikaner South Africans and other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.\n\nIn February, the US president announced the suspension of critical aid to South Africa and offered to allow members of the Afrikaner community  who are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers  to settle in the US as refugees.\n\nSouth Africas ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was later expelled after accusing Trump of mobilising a supremacism and trying to project white victimhood as a dog whistle.\n\nIn the Oval Office in May, Trump confronted South Africas President Cyril Ramaphosa and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and persecuted.\n\nThe White House also played a video which they said showed burial sites for murdered white farmers. It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years.\n\nThe tense meeting came just days after the US granted asylum to 60 Afrikaners.\n\nThe South African government has vehemently denied that Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted.\n\nOn his first day in office on 20 January, Trump said the US would suspend USRAP to reflect the USs lack of ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans and protects their safety and security.\n\nThe US policy of accepting white South Africans has already prompted accusations of unfair treatment from refugee advocacy groups.\n\nSome have argued the US is now effectively shut to other persecuted groups or people facing potential harm in their home country, and even former allies that helped US forces in Afghanistan or the Middle East.\n\nThis decision doesnt just lower the refugee admissions ceiling, Global Refuge CEO and president Krish OMara Vignarajah said on Thursday. It lowers our moral standing.\n\nAt a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the programmes purpose as well as its credibility, she added.\n\nRefugees International also slammed the move, saying it makes a mockery of refugee protection and of American values.\n\nLet us be frank: whatever hardships some Afrikaners may face, this population has no plausible claim on refugee status  they are not fleeing systematic persecution, Refugees International said in its statement.\n\nThe South African government has yet to respond to the latest announcement.\n\nDuring the Oval Office meeting, President Ramaphosa said only that he hoped that Trump officials would listen to South Africans about the issue, and later said he believed there is doubt and disbelief about all this in [Trumps] head.\n\nEarlier this year, Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately-owned land without compensation in some circumstances.\n\nWhile the country does not release race-based crime figured, figures published earlier this year showed that 7,000 people were murdered in South African between October and December 2024.\n\nOf these, 12 were killed in farm attacks and only one of the 12 was a farmer. Five others were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nNATIONAL Tyre Services (NTS) has tabled plans to delist from the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) due to insignificant returns prompted by a tough economic environment and the influx of cheaper imports.\n\nIn a Circular to shareholders published this week, NTS said after a comprehensive review of the companys listing requirements, it was agreed that the benefits of maintaining the listing status no longer pay off as was the case in the previous years.\n\nThe company, which has been on the ZSE listing since 1969, is now seeking shareholder approval to green-light the move.\n\nThe operating environment has, however, been characterised by persistent macroeconomic instability over the past decades. The business has been adversely affected by severe exchange rate volatility, liquidity constraints and shortages of foreign currency, all of which have materially hindered the importation of tyres and raw materials, the company said.\n\nThe Zimbabwean tyre industry has, in recent years, experienced heightened competition due to low entry barriers and the influx of imported brands, resulting in a loss of market share for the company said limited access to long-term and affordable capital has also constrained the companys ability to execute its expansion strategy and maintain adequate working capital levels.\n\nDespite numerous efforts to secure funding through the local banking system, borrowing has remained prohibitively expensive. Operationally, NTS continues to face significant challenges, such as power supply deficits have disrupted production at the retreading factory, where capacity utilisation has averaged approximately 30%.\n\nIn conjunction with the proposed delisting, major shareholder Radun Investments (Private) Limited is extending a mandatory offer to acquire all shares held by minority shareholders. The offer is for a cash consideration of US$0.0248 per share. This provides a clear and structured opportunity for minority shareholders to exit their investment at a price deemed fair and reasonable by Independent Financial Advisors, said NTS.\n\nThe total indicative share trading liquidity for National Tyre Services Limited (NTS.zw) in the past 12 months, as of 1st October 2025, is US$1.06million (ZWG28.41million). An average of US$88,170 (ZWG2.37 million) per month.\n\n",

He had travelled to meet with civil society organisations (CSOs) to discuss rights violations and to offer solidarity.\n\nCiZC described Vavas deportation as a barbaric act of repression.\n\nIn a statement, CiZC condemned the treatment of its director, describing it as an attack to human rights.\n\nWe are disturbed by the continued harassment and deportations of human rights defenders and election observers whose work is not criminal but aimed at promoting human rights, good governance and democracy, the statement read.\n\nCiZC criticised President Samia Suluhu Hassan and her regime for trampling on the values of ubuntu and pan-Africanism that the countrys founding president, Julius Nyerere, stood for.\n\nVava reportedly arrived at Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam on 28 October as part of a regional solidarity mission to engage with CSOs and social movements. The mission aimed to discuss concerns over the escalating crackdown on dissent under what the coalition called the increasingly authoritarian regime which has also shut down the internet.\n\nUpon arrival, Vavas passport was reportedly confiscated by immigration officials, who subjected him to hours of interrogation and profiling in restricted airport rooms. He was later informed that he was not welcome in Tanzania and labelled a security risk-without any formal explanation.\n\nThe coalition said Vava spent the night detained in a holding cell at the airport without blankets before being deported on 29 October.\n\nTanzanian officials have remained mum on the incident.\n\n",
