            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZANU PF Legal Secretary Patrick Chinamasa has said controversial businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei is now a member of the partys Central Committee and the matter is over and irreversible.\n\nTagwireis co-option into the Central Committee has dragged on, with a faction within the ruling party reportedly opposed to his endorsement into the influential organ.\n\nIn a statement posted on socialmedia, Chinamasa said, The Zanupf Department of Legal Affairs is relieved and takes note that the furore/controversy/confusion/wrangle/much ado about nothing/social media hype/misinformation/disinformation that surrounded Harare Provincial Coordinating Committee (PCC) co-option of Cde Kudakwashe Tagwirei into the Zanu PF Central Committee is now over and irreversibly settled.\n\nFrom the outset, it was difficult to understand the source of the problem. Our Harare PCC convened on Monday, 31 March 2025, and voted to recommend the cooption of Cde Tagwirei into the Central Committee.\n\nThe Province addressed the letter of recommendation to the Zanupf Secretary General, Cde Dr. Obert Moses Mpofu. The letter was copied to the Departments of the Commissariat and Legal Affairs, amongst others.\n\nThe confirmation by Chinamsa is in contradiction with the ZANU PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwasremarks earlier this month that Tagwireis bribe would not work in the party.\n\nTagwireis admission into this elite structure is being widely interpreted as part of a long-term strategy to position him for a future presidential bid, setting him on a collision course with other factions, particularly those aligned with Vice President Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nThe ZANU PF benefactor has been viewed as exploiting his proximity to President Emmerson Mnangagwa to push his leadership agenda.\n\nChinamasa acknowledged that the co-option of Tagwirei has been divisive in the ruling party.\n\nSo the controversy surrounding Cde Tagwireis co-option into the Central Committee surprises me and took me completely off guard. Given Cde Tagwireis commitment to Zanupf and his track record in the service of the Party, the somewhat negative publicity and narrative surrounding his co-option into the Central Committee is undeserved.\n\nI have been a member of the Zanupf Central Committee continuously and without break since December 1987, and a member of the Zanupf Politburo since the year 2000 to date, and I can state unequivocally that throughout this long period of nearly 38 years as Central Committee or as Politburo, we have never had to debate, let alone discuss, PCC recommendations of cooptions into the Central Committee. We always treated such recommendations as fait accompli.\n\nThe cooption of Cde Tagwirei is the first ever to be the subject of discussion and social media commentaries. The only explanation why the Tagwirei cooption has attracted such controversy may be because there are people out there who, for reasons best known to themselves, have an axe to grind, said Chinamasa.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nA NURSE at Bikita Rural Hospital in Masvingo province, who was seriously injured by a violent maternity patient while on duty seven years ago, is now bedridden without compensation, support, and medical care she was denied by the government.\n\nOn the night of August 13, 2018, Progress Muzuva left Bikita Rural Hospital after she was assigned to escort a pregnant patient in need of emergency care to Silveira Mission Hospital as part of her duties.\n\nThe patient she was escorting seemed stable when they began the journey, but suddenly became violent, screaming, throwing herself against the ambulances body, and trying to leap from the moving vehicle in a bid to commit suicide.\n\nMuzuva fought to save her patient from taking her own life while the ambulance bounced along the rural road. The driver was reportedly unaware of the chaos in the back.\n\nAt one point, the woman smashed the ambulance window and tried to leap out. That is when the driver realised something was amiss and finally stopped and opened the door, only to be greeted by punches. The patient then fled.\n\nMuzuva and the driver chased her through the darkness and brought her back into the ambulance.\n\nMuzuva, fearing another outburst, refused to leave the woman alone and stayed in the back of the ambulance.\n\nMoments later, the woman went into labour and Muzuva delivered the baby with her bare hands.\n\nThe violent mother, now delusional, accused Muzuva of swapping the baby upon realising it was a girl and started screaming and trying to kill the infant.\n\nI was shielding the newly born baby from her mother who wanted to kill her with one hand holding the slippery baby while another one pushing the bleeding mother away, Muzuva narrated her ordeal to NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nMuzuva and the driver finally arrived at Silveira and handed over the baby and the mother safely; however, her own body was broken.\n\nSeasoned obstetrician and gynaecologist, Dr Tawanda Matsa told NewZimbabwe.com that the patients condition may have been triggered by post natal depression that may be caused by social circumstances.\n\nThis may have been a result of the social circumstances she was in. Maybe she was looking for a boy child for a long time and this may have made her end up rejecting the child and going through a condition called Puerperal Psychosis\n\nSometimes the patient may also have suffered from an underlying psychotic disorder, previously or bipolar.\n\nMost of these psychotic issues happen soon after delivery. About 80% of women experience postpartum blues, which usually last a few days. 20% of women also suffer from postpartum depression which most people do not take seriously as it is mild.\n\nAbout 2% to 5% of women suffer from puerperal psychosis, which happened in this situation and this is the far end of postpartum depression, Matsa said.\n\nDenied medical assistance by the government\n\nThe following day after the incident, Muzuva realised she had sustained serious injuries as her left leg was swollen, and she could barely walk.\n\nX-rays confirmed her leg was fractured and her spine had been injured.\n\nThe government which is the very institution she served, turned its back on her.\n\nI was given a normal sick leave instead of compensatory sick leave, which is supposed to be given to someone who has been injured while on duty. I was referred to a neurosurgeon in Gweru at Claybank Hospital, Muzuva said.\n\nHer requests for an ambulance to travel to specialist hospitals were denied. Authorities from the district office refused even to write her a letter explaining how she got injured.\n\nThe process of having to find money delayed her from getting assistance while her condition deteriorated.\n\nI struggled to get money and I finally managed to hire a commuter omnibus, removing seats and lying on a mattress just to get to my appointments as I cannot sit anymore, she narrated.\n\nShe paid for every CT scan, every X-ray, and every consultation out of her own pocket money, which she did not have.\n\nShe is now bedridden and owes US$11,000 in medical bills, and has to go through another surgery.\n\nDespite multiple specialist referrals, Muzuva was denied government assistance at every turn.\n\nMedical reports seen by NewZimbabwe.com show that a neurosurgeon confirmed that her spine was fractured and required immediate surgery.\n\nThe Ministry of Health refused to help and turned down every ambulance request or financial assistance.\n\nBetrayed by a system which does not care\n\nMuzuva only got her full salary in the first two months after sick leave and in the third month, the salary was deducted by 50%.\n\nShe kept begging the human resource (HR) manager to put her on compensatory sick leave so she could get her full salary and other assistance, but was told off.\n\nI really needed the salary for medical expenses and I kept begging the District HR to put me on compensatory sick leave and he said to me, if you now want to work here at the HR offices, you may come and I will come and sleep in that bed as you, Muzuva told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nAfter a full year of agony, Muzuva finally underwent spinal surgery in December 2019 at Parirenyatwa Hospital.\n\nAccording to her, four days later, Bikita District HR called her to come so they could discuss her situation, and she explained to her that she could not manage as she had gone through surgery and was still recovering in the hospital.\n\nThe HR made it clear that if she failed to present herself immediately, she should not bother them with her matter. This threat forced Muzuva to hire transport and make the journey, only to be told the medical board she was supposed to meet was not available.\n\nShe had to hire a car back to Parirenyatwa Hospital in Harare to continue with her admission.\n\nHer spine continued to deteriorate, she could no longer sit, walk, or use the toilet and started wearing adult diapers.\n\nLater in 2021, while her health worsened, the government deepened its betrayal and wrote to her saying it wanted her to retire but she refused on the basis that the letter stated she was not injured at work, which meant she was not entitled to the compensation she was supposed to get.\n\nSince then, she used to do follow ups and they have ignored her.\n\nShe reached every responsible office in the ministry from the district level to the minister and has been ignored, denied access, had calls dropped, and denied appointments.\n\nAt one point, she was allegedly told by an official, one Miss Masale in Masvingo province, that I am your employer and if I am quiet, it means there is nothing which needs us to communicate, we have the whole province to run, so I do not bath to just come and handle your matter alone. So I will call you,usandinetse, she said.\n\nDoctors recommended another operation, but again, she lacked the money.\n\nIn January 2023, she underwent a second major operation to install rods and screws in her back and she was assisted by private doctors out of pity, even when she could not afford it.\n\nThe procedure was too late to stop the permanent damage and she still needs reviews, MRIs, and dynamic X-rays but she cannot afford them.\n\nIn September 2023, Muzuva had her last check-up, and two years have now passed without medical follow-up.\n\nNdonzwa kubaiwa (I feel stabbing pain when I move, when I step. The iron in my back is shifting, but I cannot go back for help, Muzuva trembled as she narrated her story to this publication.\n\nSince 2023 to date, Muzuva has been home and she went to the Masvingo Provincial Medical Director earlier this year and was denied access.\n\nShe then went to the provincial HR office where another unidentified official who was there said: munonetsa imimi handiti makati munozvigona mukaenda kuhead office saka mazovingei kuno.\n\nIn 2024, she learned that the ministry had forged a letter on her behalf showing she had accepted retirement in 2022.\n\nThrough the back and forth of trying to get her deserved assistance, Muzuva then got to know that the government had even hired a legal team to handle her case as they tried to deny she was injured at work.\n\nSeven years still investigating while her health deteriorates\n\nMeanwhile, after facing a deluge of criticism over the matter, the panicky Ministry of Health issued a press statement at the weekend saying it is reviewing Muzuvas case through legal and administrative channels.\n\nThe Ministry wishes to clarify that this case has not been ignored by the current administration. In fact, procedures are actively underway to assist her.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that resolution of such matters is not a one-day event. Reviewing a case that dates back to 2018 requires careful and thorough examination of both records and procedures.\n\nTo that end, the matter was referred to the ministrys legal advisors to assess whether all applicable legal and human resources guidelines were properly followed during her handling, including her leave, retirement, and any associated benefits, reads a statement from the underfire ministry.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, there was a recent landmark judgment in the Zimbabwe Courts on land acquisition and compensation by the government which may affect some acquired land, what was the case about?\n\nVM: Yes, there was indeed a landmark constitutional judgment delivered on 29thJuly, 2025 in Alistair Michael Fletcher v Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development and others.\n\nWell, I will attempt to summarise the facts. The land in question is in Umguza on the peripheries of Bulawayo City. It was incorporated into the City of Bulawayo through a statutory instrument issued by the President in 1999. Sometime in 2000, the land was subsequently gazetted for acquisition by the State under the land reform program and caveats were placed on the title deeds to perfect the acquisition.\n\nThe main issue for contention was whether or not the land was capable of acquisition under the land reform program which targeted agricultural land, as the land had become urban land by means of the statutory instrument of 1999, I referred to and various correspondence from the Bulawayo City Council which referred to it and adjacent lands as urban territory.\n\nReporter: At face value, it appears simple enough, what where the main areas of contention?\n\nVM: It may appear so, however, there was a conflict in the understanding and application of various constitutional provisions. Main being the interpretation of S16B (2) of the old constitution which limited the rights of individual to challenge the acquisition of land for agricultural purposes after it has been gazetted and conversely, the rights of the courts to adjudicate on such cases where land was acquired under the land reform process. S16B (3) of the same constitution reserved judicial review powers with the courts where expropriation was not in terms of section 16 B(2) as was eventually decided in this case. The other constitutional questions which had to be decided included the right to hold, use and not be deprived of property and the right to equal protection and benefit of the law in situations where the application of s16B(2)a was challenged, which section is now s72 of the new constitution.,\n\nReporter: What was the decision of the court and its reasoning?\n\nVM: The Constitutional Court agreed with the decision of the High Court that the land in question was urban land by virtue of it being classified as such by law and the City of Bulawayo, that being so, the State cannot compulsorily acquire urban land without compensation by using the constitutional provisions reserved for land reform acquisitions.\n\nCompensation in land reform acquisitions is limited to improvements made on land.\n\nIn reaching its decision, the court considered the meaning of agricultural land in terms of the constitution and whether Mr. Fletchers land can be classified as agricultural land. It also considered its own jurisdiction to hear the matter on the basis of whether the land in question was agricultural or urban land.\n\nReporter: What are the key takeaways from this judgment?\n\nVM: Key takeaways are that the land reform constitutional provisions ousting the authority of the courts to hear and determine acquired land refer only to agricultural land.\n\nThe courts still retain the right to hear cases to confirm whether such acquisition was done in terms of the constitutional provisions and for cases referring to compensation of improvements.\n\nThe courts also upheld the constitutional provisions relating to right to property and equal access to the courts for all urban land.\n\nThe other takeaway is not mentioned in the judgment but is necessary as it reasserts the position that our court system still functions; this is a clear case separating the government and judiciary in their interpretation of the law.\n\nReporter: How will this judgment affect owners of tracts of land in periurban areas?\n\nVM: In my view, it brings certainty that once land is classified as urban land, it is not capable of compulsory acquisition under the land reform program or acquisition without compensation. It will assist developers and investors in their planning, knowing there is precedent from the highest court securing property rights\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima, we have to end here because of our time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",
