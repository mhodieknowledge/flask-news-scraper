These are considered to be a type of option since they give a companys stockholders the right, but not the obligation, to purchase additional shares in the company.\n\nOK Zimbabwe is grappling with a mounting debt crisis of almost US$30 million accumulated over recent years.\n\nA detailed breakdown of the arrears shows the company owes US$24 million to suppliers, US$5.12 million in other payables such as utilities and service providers, and US$880,000 in statutory obligations.\n\nTo avert the crisis, the top retailer has since sacked its top management team, placed selected properties on sale and moved to float a Rights Offer.\n\nIn a latest announcement to shareholders this week, OK Zimbabwe company secretary, Margaret Munyuru said the offer was well subscribed with 100% uptake of the offer.\n\nTotal Rights Offer shares subscribed for 1 834 982 573 amount raised US$20 million 100% Rights Offer Shares. The Rights Offer was fully subscribed through a combination of shareholder take up underwriters in accordance with the underwriting agreement, she said.\n\nThe Board expressed its appreciation to shareholders for their continued support and to the underwriters for their commitment to the success of the capital raising exercise.\n\nProceeds from the Rights Offer will be applied towards partial settlement of legacy creditors, supporting the Companys working capital expenditure requirements and unlocking fresh supplier support.\n\nThe board also wishes to advise shareholders that the process relating to property disposal programme remains on-going.\n\nThe company are currently receiving and evaluating offers for the identified properties, with discussions under way to ensure that any transactions concluded are in the best interests of shareholders and are consistent with the companys strategic objectives, added Munyuru.\n\n",

The projected surplus will continue to be supported by improvements in merchandise exports and remittances, he said.\n\nThe MPS shows that the financial soundness metrics indicate that the banking sector is safe and sound despite some issues of prudential concern at a few institutions.\n\nAs at June 30, 2025, 17 out of 19 banking institutions reported core capital above the minimum regulatory capital requirements and the non-performing loans ratio stood at 2.89% compared to 3.37% as at 31 December 2024.\n\nOfficial records also show that during the same period, remittances rose to US$635,2 million signaling a 7,1% increase compared to the same period last year.\n\nTo year end, remittances are projected to increase by 4.9% from US$2.6 billion in 2024 to US$2.7 billion in 2025, sustaining a positive current account balance. Given the strategic importance of the diaspora community, the Government seeks to strengthen their role in the development of the country.\n\n",

The time to act is now, not later, he said.But in a statement, the ZCTU acting secretary general, Runesu Dzimiri said issuing such drastic measures move without an alternative is not favourable for the people of Zimbabwe, especially at a time when 88% of the population is working in the informal economy.He reminded the government that the chaos in the streets is a direct result of poor policies and weak governance systems, which have plunged the nation into chaos.The streets are congested with millions of graduates from tertiary institutions, because the economy has failed to create enough jobs to absorb job seekers owing to the collapse of the industry. Unemployment and the high cost of living are also factors forcing citizens into night vending.The National Development Strategy 1 had envisioned to create 760,000 jobs for the period 2020-2025 however, this has not been the case, he said.Dzimiri urged the government to accept the reality that even the smaller percentage currently employed is barely receiving a living wage and are now subsiding salaries with vending machines, making the trade the only option in the face of unsustainable unemployment levels.The ZCTU criticised the government for overseeing the construction of irrelevant workspaces across the country arguing that such initiatives lack the appreciation of how the informal sector works.We note and appreciate the establishment of vending stalls in places like Mbare and other sites as a great move. However, issues of accessibility to these sites are a barrier discouraging people to go and occupy those stalls, he said.He said going forward, Local authorities need to learn and apply the City of Mutare model which identified areas for night vending and established such places for licensed vendors in a move which has assisted in controlling waste disposal, poor sanitation and has also boosted revenues while for local enhancing service delivery.Dzimiri said the governments mantra of leaving no person and no place behind should encompass policy making processes.This ban will leave many unemployed and vulnerable women, youths and graduates roaming in the streets vending behind, suffering and continuously wallowing in poverty.The Vision 2030 of an upper middle class income economy needs strategic interventions to address the economic crisis, not these drastic, repulsive orders that will only cause chaos as police chase vendors without addressing the root causes of the challenges facing millions of Zimbabwe, he added.\n\nRecently, Local Government Minister, Daniel Garwe touched a raw nerve after issuing a directive to ban night vending.\n\nNight vending has brought with it illicit drug and substance dealings, which is a threat to health, economy and national security.The importation and selling of second-hand clothing is banned, and consequently street and night vending activities are equally banned.

While in college, I launched a movie business through a deal with my university, which ignited my passion for entrepreneurship.\n\nDuring my industrial work experience, I started a condiments buying and selling business that eventually grew to the point of exporting to Zambia. After college, I briefly worked at Telecel, TelOne, and Zuva Petroleum in various managerial roles.\n\nThe leaders at TelOne and Zuva greatly influenced my development as a manager and leader, and I am grateful for their mentorship. My wife, who is also my business partner, has played a significant role in my journey. I am a firm believer in God, and I recognise that I wouldnt be where I am today without His mercy.\n\nQN:Walk us through how you launched your businesses and what inspired the journey.\n\nRM:I started my first business while in college by seizing a unique opportunity to run a movie venture. This experience taught me the importance of innovation and calculated risks. On industrial attachment at Dairibord, I started buying and selling condiments from work and exporting to Zambia.\n\nMy condiments business later flourished, allowing me to reinvest and explore further opportunities in education and technology, which ultimately led me to energy and the construction and real estate sectors, where I recognised significant potential to do much more across Africa.\n\nQN: What has managed to sustain your firms in this difficult economic environment?\n\nRM:Our resilience is rooted in our commitment to quality and innovation. We embrace learning and quickly adapt to change. By identifying the critical need for housing and infrastructure in Zimbabwe, we have focused on developing clusters and high-rise flats that maximise space and align with market demands. This strategic focus has enabled us to thrive even in challenging economic conditions.\n\nQN: You have expanded outside of the country. How has that experience been, and how are the firms performing abroad?\n\nRM:Expanding beyond Zimbabwe has been a rewarding experience, allowing us to tap into new markets and diversify our portfolio. Our firms abroad are performing well as we adapt our strategies to local needs while maintaining the high standards weve established. The Chartered Institute of Customer Management is now operating in 13 countries across Africa.\n\nQN: Your portfolio spans construction (Picco), education, energy, and more. How do you identify opportunities across such diverse sectors, and whats your strategy for scaling them?\n\nRM:Identifying opportunities across diverse sectors requires a keen understanding of market dynamics and trends. My previous work experience informs many of my ventures.\n\nI focus on thorough research and analysis to pinpoint market gaps. My strategy for scaling involves building strong partnerships, nurturing relationships, leveraging technology, and maintaining a customer-centric approach to meet the evolving needs of our clients.\n\n",
