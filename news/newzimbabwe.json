            "content": "Business Insider Africa\n\nZimbabwes ZiG is heading toward failure, not through rapid devaluation, but through growing irrelevance, according to Imara Asset Management, the countrys oldest independent brokerage.\n\nUnlike past currency collapses, which were driven by hyperinflation, the ZiGs downfall is being shaped by policy missteps and a prolonged liquidity crunch in its sixth month,Bloombergreported.\n\nThe ZiG is Zimbabwes sixth attempt in 15 years to establish a stable local currency. Launched a year ago, it is backed by 2.5 tons of gold and $100 million in foreign currency reserves held by the central bank.\n\nAbout 80% of transactions in the country are still conducted in U.S. dollars, with some also made in South African rand. Last year, Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa declared that the ZiG would become the sole legal tender by 2030, phasing out the existing multicurrency system.\n\nDespite its gold backing, the ZiG has failed to win public confidence. Its value has declined, and efforts by authorities to encourage widespread adoption have largely fallen flat.\n\nPersistence Gwanyanya, a member of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwes monetary policy committee, pushed back against the Imara report, stating that the liquidity issues are limited to the parallel market, and not the formal banking system.\n\nIts not extinction of ZiG, but unwinding of US dollar positions into the local currency thats next and will help release credit into the economy,Gwanyanya said.\n\nStill, Imara argues that the central banks strategy, particularly its decision to raise interest rates to support the ZiG and fight inflation, is backfiring by encouraging more people to rely on the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe Imara executives emphasized that monetary policy alone wont solve Zimbabwes economic challenges. They urged the government to focus on boosting revenues and curbing deficit spending.\n\nIn a blunt conclusion, they said: It would be better simply to scrap [the ZiG] and move on.\n\n",

They live here. They built their lives and businesses here, and they must be part of Africas future, Zanu-PF spokesman Christopher Mutsvangwa is reported as saying.\n\nAfrikaners, like all Africans, have a duty to reinvest in the continent and contribute to its growth.\n\nMnangagwa said it is time to focus on rebuilding Zimbabwe, and that required acknowledging past challenges while working together for a united future.\n\nCapital knows no race, and we are calling on all who identify with this continent to invest in it.\n\nShifting political winds\n\nThe meeting comes the same week that Zimbabwe started compensating dispossessed white farmers with an initial payment of $3.1 million (R58 million) out of a total of $3.5 billion (R66 billion) agreed under the governments 2020 Global Compensation Deed (GCD) pledge.\n\nThis is an agreement to compensate nearly 4 000 former farm owners for the seizure of their farms under the Fast Track Land Reform Programme initiated under former president Robert Mugabe nearly 20 years ago. Payments will be made for improvements to the land, not the land itself.\n\nIn another sign of the shifting political winds in the region, Zimbabwe became the first African country to suspend all tariffs on goods originating in the US, just three days after the US imposed 18% tariffs on exports from Zimbabwe.\n\nIn the spirit of constructing a mutually beneficial and positive relationship with the United States of America, under the leadership of President Trump, I will direct the Zimbabwean government to implement a suspension of all tariffs levied on goods originating from the United States, wrote Mnangagwa on X.\n\nThis measure is intended to facilitate the expansion of American imports within the Zimbabwean market, while simultaneously promoting the growth of Zimbabwean exports destined for the United States.\n\nThis action underscores our commitment to a framework of equitable trade and enhanced bilateral cooperation.\n\nThe dropping of tariffs on US goods and paying out dispossessed white farmers is part of a charm offensive by Harare to unlock international financing and re-engage with international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\n\nMixed reactions in Zimbabwe\n\nThe outreach to the Afrikaner business community, with representatives from sectors such as agriculture and energy, has drawn mixed reactions in Zimbabwe.\n\nSome, such as political analyst Alex Rungunda, see this as a rhetorical departure for Zanu-PF, which historically adopted a confrontational stance on land and race. However, it may also be a sign of desperation, he says, as the country urgently needs capital and goodwill.\n\nWar veterans and land reform activists were less accommodating of the softening stance on historical injustices.\n\nOn Zimbabwes dropping of tariffs on US goods, journalist Hopewell Chinono says the move is more political than economic. Perhaps the president believes this could serve as a sweetener for his removal from the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act sanctions. A long shot though! hewroteon X.\n\nZimbabwe did not coordinate the move with its regional partners, whereas the EU will put forward its response to tariffs as a bloc.\n\nEconomically, it does not make much sense for Mnangagwa to prioritise appeasing the United States in this way  especially through unilateral concessions or alignments, given Zimbabwes trade realities and regional context, says Chinono.\n\nANC uncomfortable with all this\n\nAdvocate Simba Chitando, chair of the Zanu-PF Sandton branch, speaking in his private capacity, says many members of the ANC are uncomfortable with the bridges Zanu-PF is building with the West and with white farmers, which will lead to rapid economic growth.\n\nThey dont want Harare to reach its potential, because they believe Pretoria would be weaker, and black South Africans poorer than black Zimbabweans, he said.\n\nA fear that is at the root of xenophobia, and tensions between the two people.\n\nHowever, the world can no longer ignore the fact that Zimbabwe is on the rise while South Africa is on the decline.\n\n",

Youre not distracted by slots, roulette, or poker content. This means the site can go deeper into the game and cover topics other places skip.\n\nFor example, one article breaks down banker vs. player bets across thousands of hands, showing exact outcomes and house edges.

Others replied with similar experiences, turning it into a mini-discussion that was both helpful and honest.\n\nBeing part of this community can keep you motivated and give you new ideas to try. You dont feel alone in your journeyand thats important when youre trying to improve a skill.\n\nIts one thing to read a guide. Its another to learn from people who have played hundreds or thousands of baccarat sessions and can explain what works.\n\nTheBaccarat Wiki on Quorais full of user-submitted questions, with answers from experienced players and contributors to the main site.

Trials like this are so important to help us discover new treatment options.\n\nShe said the best way to prevent an STI is by using a condom. If someone has had condom-less sex with a new or casual partner, they should get tested.\n\nEarly detection not only protects a persons health but prevents transmission to others. Testing is quick, free and confidential, she said.\n\nSource: NHS\n\n",
