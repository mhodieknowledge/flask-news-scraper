            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nPARENTS and guardians of school-going children are facing a torrid time preparing learners for the new 2025 calendar year that kicks off next Tuesday, January 14.\n\nIt is particularly burdening for those with children progressing from Early Childhood Development (ECD) to Grade One, and from Grade Seven into secondaryschool as pupils need new sets of uniforms, stationery, among other paraphernalia such as trunks, which are very expensive for many.\n\nThe streets of Harare, Bulawayo, Mutare, Chinhoyi, and indeed other urban areas, were this week bustling with back-to-school shoppers buying trunks, plastic and khaki covers, books from reputable and fly-by-night as well as street stationery retailers.\n\nIn snap surveys conducted by NewZimbabwe.com, parents and guardians complained about the ever-rising cost of sending children to school amid worsening economic conditions and a high unemployment rate.\n\nMostly, interviewees complained of the United States dollar-denominated tuition fees and levies, high prices of school uniforms at most retailers while others expressed concern over some institutions forcing them to buy expensively priced products at schools.\n\nDumisani Munyulwa, a male vendor living with a disability plying his trade in central Harare and making ends meet by selling school supplies, shared the challenges he faces as schools reopen for the new calendar.\n\nYes, schools are opening, but its now different from years back. Business used to be brisk during this time of the year, but nowadays street sales are low. This is because most schools are now selling their own uniforms and stationery.\n\nThe competition is stiff, and l am not sure if l will be able to buy new uniforms and stationery for my own kids, pay US$ school fees for my three kids, one in Form Three, the other Form One and the last in Grade Five, Munyulwa told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nMunyulwa is not alone as his sentiments are shared by Lovemore Chitanda, who noted the financial strain that the new school term has brought him in the wake of high spending during the just-ended Christmas and New Year holidays.\n\nThe festive season really took a toll on my purse as I and my family had to travel to the rural areas. Now, l am facing the challenges of items needed for my Form One kid which surpass US$600, and also my Grade 7 child who has their needs, said Chitanda.\n\nMelissa Chipwanya shared the struggles faced by parents, particularly those with multiple children.\n\nThings are hard since we are just coming from the holidays. Schools require money but the budgeted cash wont be enough to buy uniforms, books and other stuff needed. In most cases, you wont be having one child, but two to three, who need to be taken to school, and all expenses fully paid.\n\nAs for myself, I have two kids, one in Form Three and the other Form One, both at Klein Manasse High School. As for the younger one, since hes starting secondary education, he needs a new set of uniforms which the school says must be purchased at the school only which is sightly expensive than buying from the streets or other shops. Its hard, said Chipwanya.\n\nMeanwhile, not all parents are facing challenges as some had to make sacrifices during the festive season and budgeted for the schools opening.\n\nOne Muzariri, a parent who has already managed to pay for his childrens fees, noted the sacrifices made to meet educational costs.\n\nBasically, the start of a new year, school items will be on demand, and they tend to cost slightly higher than during the course of the year, but it needs oneself, as a parent, to be prepared for the challenges.\n\nWe have paid for all the fees; we had to make sacrifices. During Christmas we did not spend unnecessarily, so all the required fees has been paid thats where we are coming from now. We are doing the final shopping for uniforms as well as stationery.\n\nMy son is going for Form Three at Chinhoyi High School, and my daughter is going in Grade Three at Chivaraidze Primary School, and all is set for the 2025 school year, said Muzariri.\n\nCynthia Munyongani conceded that the high cost of education in Zimbabwe which is taking a knock on citizens pockets.\n\nAs parents we confront these challenges head-on and making huge sacrifices. The reopening of schools serves as a reminder of the ongoing economic pressures associated with funding education in Zimbabwe.\n\nWith many families feeling the pinch, the upcoming term will test their resilience and resourcefulness as they strive to provide for their childrens educational needs, said Munyongani\n\nPrimary and Secondary Education permanent secretary, Moses Mhike has warned schools engaging in unethical behaviours of chasing away learners without fully paid fees, those that demand fees only in United States dollars and those who make it compulsory to buy uniforms at the respective schools.\n\nNo school should force any parent to pay fees or levies exclusively in foreign currency. Parents are free to pay in any currency of their choice, as Zimbabwe operates under a multi-currency regime.\n\nHeads of schools and responsible authorities are, therefore, warned to abide by this directive and refrain from mandating parents to buy uniforms and stationery exclusively at their schools, Mhike was quoted by State media.\n\n",

There is no fear, Foreign Affairs Minister Abderaman Koulamallah said while surrounded by soldiers in a live Facebook broadcast filmed inside what appeared to be a quiet presidential palace late Wednesday.\n\nIn an interview with state TV, Koulamallah praised the vigilance of the palace guards, describing the attackers as disorganized and intoxicated by alcohol and drugs. When asked if the attack was terrorism, he said it was probably not, as the attackers were local youths from the capital, NDjamena.\n\nThe attack occurred the same day as a visit by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, who congratulated Deby Itno on reestablishing constitutional order.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, rumors spread online that the attack was the work of Islamic militant group Boko Haram.\n\nBoko Haram, which launched an insurgency more than a decade ago against Western education, seeks to establish Islamic law in Nigerias northeast. The insurgency has spread to neighboring West African countries including Cameroon, Niger and Chad.\n\nChad, a country of nearly 18 million people, has been reeling from political turmoil before and after a controversial presidential election that resulted in Deby Itnos victory. He had led the country as interim president during the period of military rule that followed the death of his father in 2021.\n\n",

            "content": "By Tapiwa Svondo\n\nTHE recent deaths of 18 hippopotamus in Sapi Safari Area and one in Chirundu was due to poisonous substances used in open cast mining at Chinese-owned establishments, the Centre for Natural Resource Governance (CNRG) has said.\n\nThe claim flies in the face of preliminary findings by the Zimbabwe National Parks and Wildlife Authority (ZimParks), which said the giant mammals succumbed to malnutrition.\n\nIn a statement, CNRG said mining activities were decimating wildlife habitats, hence various species were dying at an alarming rate.\n\nThe sudden and significant loss of these hippos highlights potential underlying environmental issues, such as habitat degradation, water pollution, or the detrimental effects of human activities in the area.\n\nThis incident underscores the urgent need for stronger wildlife conservation efforts and stricter enforcement of environmental regulations to safeguard Zimbabwes rich biodiversity, said the environment watchdog.\n\nCNRG noted that processes used by Chinese to extract gold is contributing to the deaths of animals due to toxic mining chemicals that enter the soil and water.\n\nIn a broader context, CNRG is alarmed by the rapid growth of large-scale open-cast mining operations across Zimbabwe in the past five years, particularly those led by Chinese nationals collaborating with the countrys political elites.\n\nThese mining operations, which often completely disregard the rule of law, have raised serious concerns about their impact on local communities, the environment, and biodiversity.\n\nA particularly controversial practice these operations employ is heap leaching, commonly used in gold recovery. This process involves treating gold ore with a dilute alkaline sodium cyanide solution. While cost-effective for large-scale mining, heap leaching poses significant environmental and health risks.\n\nThe toxic chemicals used in the process can easily contaminate water sources and soil, leading to long-term ecological damage and harm to local populations.\n\nIt is no coincidence that the deaths of white rhinoceros and fish at Lake Chivero and the hippos in the Zambezi Valley occur during the rainy season. The rains wash the poorly disposed cyanide into surface runoff, contaminating rivers and dams. The threat to humans is extremely high, said CNRG.\n\nThe lobby group has called for an immediate investigation into the hippo deaths to implement measures protecting remaining wildlife.\n\nCNRG calls for a thorough investigation into the cause of the deaths of hippos to ensure appropriate measures are taken to protect the remaining wildlife and prevent further losses.\n\nParliament, accused of inaction to stop environmental harm, has been called upon to take decisive action to fix challenges facing local communities. Parliament and other State institutions, CNRG says, risk losing public trust.\n\nParliament should conduct an urgent site visit to Premier Estate, and take prompt, decisive action to address the violations raised in the petition. It is crucial that the concerns of local populations are taken seriously, and that Zimbabwes natural resources are preserved for future generations, reads the statement.\n\nOne of the most concerning examples of this is the case of Sino Africa Huijin, a Chinese mining syndicate operating at Premier Estate in Old Mutare. In 2023, CNRG petitioned Parliament regarding the pollution of the Mutare River-a vital tributary of the Odzi River-caused using heap leaching techniques at this site.\n\nDespite extensive oral evidence hearings involving CNRG, the Environmental Management Agency (EMA), and the Ministry of Mines, which were concluded in May 2024, Parliament has yet to take any action. The lack of a site visit to Premier Estate and the failure to address the petition has led to increasing frustration among local communities, environmental groups, and concerned citizens.\n\nParliament was urged to conduct an urgent site visit to Premier Estate, and take prompt, decisive action to address the violations raised in the petition.\n\nIt is crucial that the concerns of local populations are taken seriously, and that Zimbabwes natural resources are preserved for future generations.\n\nWe urge Parliament to take immediate and decisive action to address the devastating environmental impact of mining activities across the country, said CNRG.\n\n",

            "content": "By Sport Reporter\n\nFOR a number of years, local football administration has been dominated by men, reducing women to cheerleaders.\n\nBut that is now a story of the past, thanks to the new Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) Constitution adopted last year ahead of January 25, 2025, elections, which will usher into power a new executive to take over from the Normalisation Committee.\n\nFor the first time in a ZIFA poll, more than 10 women are going to be participating, thanks to Article 38 of the Constitution, which states that one of the executives two vice presidents should be a woman.\n\nThe move has since encouraged more women to take part in the upcoming elections rather than seating back to their cheerleading roles as in the past.\n\nOf the 10 women contesting in the upcoming plebiscites, five will be battling it out for the vice presidents role. These include, Joyce Kapota, Mavis Gumbo, Patience Mutumwa, Winnert Murota and Loveness Mukura, while the other five are up for board members posts, these include Kudzai Kadzombe, Sibekiwe Ndlovu, Cecillia Gambe, Alice Zeure and Beaullar Musara.\n\nIn as much as the increase in women participation is encouraging, analysts believe that these candidates are fronts used by powerful male football mafias to maintain their grip on Zimbabwean football.\n\nBut is that the case? Well for one of the contesting candidates, Kadzombe, her motivation was mainly to create female role models for young girls out there.\n\nIm driven by the need to fill the gap in terms of female representation in football.\n\nGrowing up, I was inspired by attending Warriors matches in the 90s. Now, I believe its my time to make a meaningful impact through policy formulation and football development, Kadzombe said.\n\nThere is a huge gap when it comes to the girl child; sometimes they are treated as non-existent.\n\nSo, I need to push that each team in the PSL, in any area zones in all the districts and the regions, has a womens team that participates in a league just like men do, Kadzombe was quoted in a media interview recently.\n\nAnother contesting candidate, Mutumwa, said a lot needs to be done for Zimbabwean football to return to its former glory, and as part of her manifesto, she promised an overhaul of the sports administration architecture.\n\nThere are so many things that need to be changed, especially issues to do with constitutionalism, issues to do with marketing brand name ZIFA and issues to do with developmental football,  said Mutumwa.\n\nIn an interview with the media, former FIFA referees instructor Ndlovu revealed that she is basing on her experience in the game, which tracks back to the late 80s when she started as a player.\n\nI started football a long way back in 1985, and l am still in the game, that is passion.\n\nI promise to deliver integrity by that l mean, l need to be honest in everything and be trusted by all stakeholders involved, said Ndlovu.\n\n",

            "content": "By Agencies\n\nMOZAMBIQUES main opposition leader, Venancio Mondlane returned from exile Thursday as security forces fired tear gas at hundreds of his supporters, who gathered near the main international airport to welcome him home.\n\nHe was seen walking off a plane at Mavalane International Airport in the capital, Maputo. He had left the country in October following a disputed election that has sparked months of violent protests and thrown the country into turmoil.\n\nEmerging from the airport with a Bible in hand, Mondlane prayed and took an oath, mimicking a presidential swearing-in ceremony. He declared himself the legitimately elected president, rejecting the official results that favored Frelimos candidate, Daniel Chapo, who is set to be inaugurated on Wednesday, January 15.\n\nMondlane stated that he is ready for dialogue with the government. He says his return is to stop the killings of his supporters and lead protests.\n\nSince October, hundreds of people have reportedly been killed, many shot by police, during protests sparked by allegations of electoral fraud.\n\nMondlane said he left Mozambique fearing for his life after two senior members of his opposition party were killed in their car by unknown gunmen in a late-night shooting in the aftermath of the election.\n\nPolice on Thursday blocked roads leading to the airport after Mondlane said on social media earlier this week he would return to the southern African country. Tear gas drifted over the airport and surrounding roads and a helicopter hovered overhead.\n\nThousands of Mondlanes supporters were expected to gather in Maputo for his return, prompting the clampdown by security forces.\n\nMore than 100 people have been killed by security forces since Mozambique erupted in protests that Mondlane called for after the long-ruling Frelimo party was declared the winner of the Oct. 9 election.\n\nMondlane and other opposition candidates accused the ruling party of rigging the election and international observers reported irregularities in the vote and the alteration of some results.\n\n",

            "content": "By VOA\n\nGOVERNMENT officials in Zimbabwe have been scrutinizing a Chinese mining company that has been operating a gold mine in the countrys east since at least 2021.\n\nThe scrutiny comes as residents voice concern about the impact on health and the environment.\n\nThe company in question is Sino Africa Huijin Holdings, which faces accusations of severe environmental destruction and community harm.\n\nIts gold prospecting operations have been taking place in an area known as Premier Estate in the Mutasa District of Manicaland.\n\nVillagers and community groups have complained about the blasting that has taken place at the mine. Nearby residents have reported widespread ecological damage, including the decimation of a mountain and the displacement of wildlife. They also say tremors from the blasts have caused structural damage to homes.\n\nResidents further complain of dust pollution and the potential contamination of water sources due to alleged leaching of cyanide. Cyanide leaching is a method of extracting gold from ore that can pollute water resources.\n\nAdding to these concerns, Sino Africa is accused of forging community signatures on their Environmental Impact Assessment document, raising questions about the transparency and legitimacy of their operations.\n\nThe complaints prompted the government to shut down the mines operations twice in 2024. In the past two months, however, mining has resumed.\n\nWe are between a rock and a hard place. If its possible, let them compensate us and relocate us because its no longer appealing, Ishewedenga Moyo, one of 30 residents living within some 300 meters of the Sino Africa Huijin mine, told VOA in December.\n\nThe vibrations and noise generated by mining blasting are disrupting wildlife habitats and ecosystems, damaging biodiversity, and causing cracks in our homes, Moyo added.\n\nGovernment-ordered suspensions\n\nA Manicaland Joint Command Task Force, composed of a number of government entities, ordered the temporary closure of Sino Africa Huijins gold mining operations twice. Officials say the shutdowns were enforced to ensure the mine met all necessary requirements.\n\nThe first suspension occurred in October and lasted two weeks. Sino Africa Huijin made pledges to improve the situation and was allowed to resume operations. Then, the task force ordered the mine to close a second time in mid-November.\n\nTraditional Chief James Kurauone of the Mutasa district told VOA on Dec. 11 that officials forced Sino Africa Huijings operations to stop each time because the company failed to address critical concerns raised by the local community.\n\nThese concerns that led to the temporary closure included severe air pollution, destructive blasting activities impacting local homes, and the companys failure to fulfill its corporate social responsibility obligations, said Mutasa in recent comments.\n\nMutasa added that he plans to convene a meeting with mining officials and members from the community to discuss a path forward in a couple of weeks.\n\nMining compliance\n\nMining operations resumed on November 25 at the conclusion of discussions among government officials, community leaders and company representatives.\n\nDaniel Panganai, the current HR manager of Sino Africa Huijin, was involved in the discussions. He told VOA in mid-December that the company complied with all the requirements outlined in writing, but I cannot divulge much information at this time.\n\nMisheck Mugadza, the Manicaland minister of state, also said in December that Sino Africa Huijin committed to adhering to all mining and environmental regulations. He said the Chinese company had acted on its social responsibility obligations by donating to the local hospital and drilling a well to provide water to the local school.\n\nThe government is closely monitoring the companys operations, Mugadza said, and some households have already received full compensation for damages. He further stated that the company is obligated to compensate all affected residents.\n\nChinese investments in Zimbabwean mines\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Sino Africa Huijin mine is not isolated, according to a September report by the Center for Natural Resource Governance, or CNRG, a Harare-based community rights organization.\n\nThe report, which assessed the impact of Chinese investment on Zimbabwes mining industry, found that Chinese mining ventures have led to widespread environmental degradation, disregard for the cultural rights of host communities, and, in many cases, the violation of the countrys labor laws, often with apparent impunity.\n\nChinese investors control an estimated 90% of the of Zimbabwes mining industry, according to the report.\n\nIn 2023 alone, Sino investments in Zimbabwes mining sector saw 121 investors contributing a staggering $2.79 billion, said CNRG Executive Director Farai Maguwu, who was quoted in a post on the organizations website.\n\nSeparately, another area resident voiced criticism of the governments response to the mining.\n\nThere are times when the mine uses explosives of higher magnitude, and there will be tremors, said area resident Thobekile Mhenziwamukuru.\n\nWhen we call the government officials about the crisis, they always go directly alone to the Sino mine offices without any community leaders, then they will come and address us, just saying they will use explosives of low magnitude next time and we now know that its now their cash cow.\n\nEven in terms of closing and reopening of the mine, instead of solving our grievances, there is no fairness in everything because money is being exchanged to slow the progress and we hope higher offices in government will come to rescue us, she concluded.\n\nMaguwu accused local lawmakers of corruption, saying, Instead of enforcing the law, they are cashing in on this illegality by forcing them to close down, demanding bribes for reopening, and then returning to close them down again and demand another bribe.\n\nDespite repeated phone calls and visits to the offices of government stakeholders to address these accusations, including the Ministry of Mines and the Environmental Management Agency, VOA received no response.\n\nThis cycle goes on and on while the environment is being sacrificed, Maguwu said.\n\n",
