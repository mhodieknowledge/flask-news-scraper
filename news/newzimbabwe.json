            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nThe latest Auditor Generals Report has once again raised flagrant breaches of Public Finance Management regulations, revealing that, as of June 2025, a staggering sum exceeding half a billion United States dollars paid by the Treasury to service providers on behalf of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in 2024 remains unaccounted for.\n\nThis substantial shortfall undermines fiscal transparency and accountability, principles crucial for sound governance.\n\nA key finding highlights a failure by MDAs to properly upload payment information onto the Public Finance Management System (PFMS). This omission creates a loophole that could facilitate embezzlement and corruption.\n\nThe report reads: Direct payments amounting to US$1,986,391,797 were made to service providers on behalf of the MDAs by Treasury during the 2024 financial year. However, MDAs accounted for US$1,388,673,713, leaving a balance of US$597,718,082 as at June 18, 2025. In some instances, the payments were not uploaded onto the PFMS. MDAs expenditure was understated by the direct payments.\n\nThis discrepancy represents a significant material misstatement of public accounts.\n\nThe failure to reconcile these payments points to a serious breakdown in internal controls, increasing the risk of fraudulent activity and illicit enrichment.\n\nThe report further details a five-month period of opacity during the currency transition from ZWL to ZWG between April and August 2024. MDAs reportedly operated outside the PFMS during this period, resulting in a vacuum of financial oversight.\n\nThere was a downtime of the Public Financial Management Systems (PFMS) during the country changeover of currency from ZWL$ to Zimbabwe Gold (ZWG) for almost five (5) months (April to August 2024). During that time most MDAs operated outside the PFMS.\n\nThe financial information that would have been processed outside the system was not uploaded onto the system in some cases. Such information would misstate expenditure figures.\n\nThis prolonged systems downtime created a black box scenario, leaving the door open for potentially unlawful financial transactions and making it incredibly difficult to trace the flow of public funds.\n\nMoreover, the Auditor Generals Report casts a spotlight on the widespread abuse of fuel allocations, noting a concerning increase in such incidents compared to 2023.\n\nPoor record-keeping practices and inadequate internal controls were identified as primary contributing factors.\n\nCases of loss of fuel were on the increase. These were attributed to control weaknesses in fuel management, ranging from non-maintenance of fuel registers, inconsistent fuel recordings, non-performance of fuel reconciliations, absence of segregation of duties and weak supervisory checks. In this report, seven (7) MDAs had issues with fuel management. Measures around fuel management should be enhanced, the report added.\n\nThe lack of robust fuel management procedures indicates a serious disregard for public assets, exposing them to potential misappropriation and wastage.\n\nSuch inefficiencies have a detrimental impact on service delivery and overall economic performance.\n\nSection 298 of the Constitution of Zimbabwe enshrines the principles of transparency and accountability within public finance management.\n\nThese findings from the Auditor Generals Report underscore the urgent need for enhanced oversight, stronger internal controls, and the rigorous enforcement of financial regulations to safeguard public funds and promote responsible fiscal governance.\n\nThe scale of the irregularities demands immediate and decisive action to hold those responsible to account and to prevent future occurrences.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Nurses Association (ZINA) has strongly condemned the governments neglect of a Bikita nurse, Progress Muzuva, who was severely injured while on duty seven years ago, calling her case a tragic example of systemic abandonment of front-line health workers.\n\nShe has since been denied compensation, medical support, and justice by the government for which she worked.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, ZINA president Enock Dongo said Muzuvas case is not an isolated incident and demanded an investigation into the matter.\n\nZINA demands a full investigation into how this matter was handled from the district authorities all the way up to head office.\n\nThose responsible for this neglect must be held accountable. What happened to Nurse Muzuva is not an isolated incident; this is just a drop in the ocean.\n\nAcross Zimbabwe, many nurses are injured while carrying out their duties, some in ambulance accidents while escorting patients, others while lifting immobile patients in wards, Dongo said.\n\nAccording to the nurses association, many health workers get injured on duty and receive no support, treatment, nor compensation.\n\nMany are left to suffer silently in their homes, unable to afford care with the meagre salaries they earn.\n\nThis culture of abandonment is pushing nurses out of the public service and out of the country to search for greener pastures elsewhere.\n\nWe ask again: Who will care for the carers? If the system fails to protect those who risk their lives for patients, then it has failed entirely.\n\nZINA calls on all relevant stakeholders to intervene urgently in Muzuvas case. She must receive immediate medical assistance, financial support, and justice. Her case should set a precedent for change, Dongo added.\n\nMuzuva told this publication that since 2018, the Health Ministry has been refusing to help her from the district level up to the ministers office.\n\nMuzuva was attacked by a violent maternity patientwhom she was escorting to Silveira Hospital in Masvingo for emergency care.\n\nThe violent patient wanted to kill herself and her newborn baby in what medical experts say could have been a case of severe postpartum psychosis.\n\nMuzuva saved the patient and her newly born baby but injured her spine and leg in the process.\n\n",

She told her family that the abductors allegedly drove with her from Gauteng to Ladysmith, KZN, and came back with her after they allegedly realised they had taken the wrong person.\n\nNkomos reappearance became a talking point on social media, with some users raising suspicion about her story.\n\nMasondo said the case of a missing person has since been closed.\n\nSowetan contacted Nkomo, who expressed frustration with how the media has been covering the story.\n\nI have noticed how you craft your articles to suit your narrative on this matter. I will be giving all that information to other media houses that will relay it the way I say it. I will not be commenting further on this matter, thanks.

How does a stone sculpture park help encourage environmental conservation?\n\nIn Harare, Zimbabwes capital, the Chapungu Sculpture Garden offers a unique fusion of art and environmentalconservation. The park is a sanctuary where sculptors carve stone works of art inspired byanimalsand other natural forms. It, in turn is designed to protectnature. Indigenous native species have been planted there to help preserve them. Artist and park manager Nicholas Kadzungura explains that they are threatened bydeforestation. The garden, founded in 1970 and named after the sacred Bateleur Eagle, serves as both a creative hub and a living classroom, where visitors learn aboutZimbabwes rich ecological and cultural heritage.\n\nMany sculptures in the park reflect Zimbabwes environmental challenges. Friend of the Rhino, a piece by the late Joseph Ndandarika, which encourages empathy and the protection ofendangered species. With only around 600 black rhinos left in Zimbabwe, the message is pressing. Marcey Mushore, the parks director, explains how animistic Shona traditions guide conservation efforts. The park also acts as agreen lungfor Hararesurban sprawl. Some 2.4 million people live in its metropolitan area and pollution and disappearing green spaces are a problem.\n\nChapungus artists are committed to sharing ancestral knowledge through sculpture workshops and educational programs. Kadzungura stresses that Zimbabwes traditional stone art is not just decorativeit carries lessons about coexistence with nature. Asclimate changeand urban development threaten the countrys wetlands andbiodiversity, the parks mission is becoming more vital. Chapungu inspires action by blending creativity, tradition, and environmental stewardship.\n\n",
