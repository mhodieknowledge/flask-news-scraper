            "content": "BBC\n\nA US-funded flight carrying the first group of 49 white South Africans to be granted refugee status has landed in Washington, after leaving Johannesburg on Sunday.\n\nRelations between South Africa and the US have been tense for months, after President Donald Trump said that members of the countrys Afrikaner minority were victims of racial discrimination.\n\nThis was dismissed by South Africas Foreign Minister Ronald Lamola, who said on Monday there is no persecution of white Afrikaner South Africans, adding that police reports debunk President Trumps assertion.\n\nSouth Africasays that any allegations of persecutionwould not meet the threshold required under domestic and international refugee law.\n\nThe BBC has contacted the United Nations refugee agency, UNHCR, which confirmed it was not involved in this resettlement scheme, nor was it asked to take part in any of the screening.\n\nGiven the Trump administrations hardline position on refugees, it is notable the process did not involve the UNHCR  showing how much the white Afrikaners have been fast-tracked and in a way that has not been done for others.\n\nDemocrat Senator Jeanne Shaheen described the resettlement as baffling given the indefinite suspension for thousands of legitimate asylum seekers from other countries.\n\nSenator Shaheen, who is also the ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in her statement that last year, the UN found no South Africans were eligible for refugee status.\n\nAsked directly on Monday why Afrikaners refugee applications had been expedited compared to other groups, Trump claimed a genocide was taking place and that white farmers specifically were being targeted.\n\nFarmers are being killed, they happen to be white, but whether theyre white or black makes no difference to me, he said.\n\nThe US has criticised domestic South African policy, accusing the government of seizing land from white farmers without any compensation  something which the southern African nation says has not happened.\n\nOne of Trumps closest advisers, South African-born Elon Musk, has previously said there was a genocide of white people in South Africa and accused the government of passing racist ownership laws.\n\nThe claims of a genocide of white peoplehave been widely discredited.\n\nFigures from the South African police show that in 2024, 44 murders were recorded on farms and smaller plots of agricultural land, with eight of those killed being farmers.\n\nSouth Africa does not report on crime statistics broken down by race but a majority of the countrys farmers are white, while other people living on farms, such as workers, are mostly black.\n\nAfrikaner author Max du Preez told the BBCs Newsday radio programme that claims of persecution of white South Africans were a total absurdity and based on nothing.\n\nHe added that South Africans were stunned by the resettlement scheme and that it had more to do with internal politics in the US than South Africa.\n\nBilateral tensions between the US and South Africa have been strained for some time as President Trump tasked his administration with formulating plans to potentially resettle Afrikaners, a group with mostly Dutch ancestry, in the US.\n\nIn March,South Africas ambassador to the US, Ebrahim Rasool, was expelledafter accusing President Trump of using white victimhood as a dog whistle, leading to the US accusing Mr Rasool of race-baiting.\n\nThe US has also criticised South Africa for taking an aggressive position against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ), where Pretoria has accused Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahus government ofgenocide against people in Gaza a claim which the Israelis strongly reject.\n\nThe current group of white South African refugees comprises 49 people, who landed in Washington DC later on Monday, before continuing to Texas.\n\nWhite South Africans make up just 7.3% of the population, but own the vast majority of privately held farmland, according to a 2017 government report.\n\nIn JanuaryPresident Cyril Ramaphosa signed a controversial law which allows the government to seize privately owned land without compensation in certain circumstances, when it is deemed equitable and in the public interest.\n\nThere had been anger in South Africa over the slow pace of land reform in the three decades since the end of the racist apartheid system.\n\nPresident Trumps openness to accepting Afrikaner refugees comes as the US has engaged in a wider crackdown on migrants and asylum seekers from other countries.\n\n",

            "content": "By Jan Bornman |GroundUp\n\nThe legal saga over the Zimbabwean Exemption Permit (ZEP) returns to court on Tuesday as the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) hears the Department of Home Affairs appeal against a ruling that temporarily protected ZEP holders from arrest and deportation.\n\nTheinterim interdict, granted in June 2023 in a case brought by the Zimbabwean Immigration Federation (ZIF), shielded all ZEP holders  about 178,000 people  while the legality of the permit systems termination was being challenged.\n\nThe validity of the ZEP was last yearextendedto November 2025.\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs is asking the SCA to set aside the interim relief granted to the ZIF, effectively reinstating the departments ability to enforce immigration laws against ZEP holders until the wider legal questions around the permits are resolved.\n\nIn its court papers, the Department of Home Affairs argues that the matter should be considered moot because theres already aseparate high court ruling, in a case brought by the Helen Suzman Foundation, that declared the ministers decision to end the ZEP system unlawful and set it aside. The department is also appealing that ruling.\n\nAccording to the department, the permits were always meant to be temporary and subject to the ministers discretion. It argues that requiring the minister to maintain the ZEPs until Zimbabwes economic conditions improve would amount to an indefinite obligation not supported by the law.\n\nIn response, the ZIF argues that the departments appeal fails to take into account the severe human consequences of terminating the ZEP system. These consequences go to the heart of constitutional rights and cannot simply be brushed aside.\n\nThe ZIF argues that it is common cause and undisputed that ZEP holders would likely be deported in the absence of an interdict preventing such deportation and that for ZEP holders that are married to South Africans there would be a breakup of families in violation of their rights to family life and dignity.\n\nThey contend that even without deportations, the sudden shift from lawful residency to undocumented status strips permit holders of basic protections. It places jobs, access to education and family stability at risk and opens people to the daily threat of arrest, harassment, or detention.\n\nZEP holders face irreversible harm, the ZIF argues. Many would not qualify for any other visa, despite having lived, worked, and built families and businesses in South Africa for over a decade.\n\nThese are not hypothetical concerns, they say. When the ZEP system was initially terminated, thousands of people were left scrambling to apply for exemptions they were unlikely to qualify for, with no realistic chance of their applications being finalised in time. That uncertainty continues to this day and remains a real and ongoing threat to livelihoods, safety, and dignity.\n\nThey claim the department relies on technical arguments to justify ignoring these impacts, but that doesnt excuse the abrupt and damaging way the policy was ended or the lack of meaningful alternatives for those affected.\n\nThe ZIF also rejects the departments claim that ZEP holders could have applied for other visas instead of relying on court protection. They argue that these alternatives were either unavailable, impractical, or too slow.\n\nThe ZEP scheme was created precisely because most permit holders did not qualify for mainstream visas and the department admitted as much in its own court filings, they argue.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nTHE United Kingdom (UK) will no longer be recruiting care workers from overseas as part of a crackdown on visas for lower-skilled workers, the Home Secretary has told the BBC.\n\nYvette Cooper said it is time to end that care worker recruitment from abroad and rules will change this year  instead requiring firms to hire British nationals or extend visas of overseas workers already in the country.\n\nThe government plans to unveilchanges to visa and recruitment laws on Mondayin a bid to cut net migration, and says measures will cut up to 50,000 lower-skilled and care workers coming to the UK over the next year.\n\nShadow home secretary Chris Philp said the plans were too little and called for an annual cap on migration.\n\nSuccessive governments have tried unsuccessfully to reduce net migration, which is the number of people coming to the UK minus the number leaving.\n\nNet migration climbed to a record 906,000 in June 2023, and last year it stood at 728,000.\n\nThe Home Office has not yet officially confirmed what will be in its immigration White Paper, due early next week.\n\nSpeaking on the BBCs Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg, Cooper said the government was setting up plans for a substantial reduction in net migration but added targets would not be set, saying they undermined the credibility of anything that governments do.\n\nThe threshold for skilled visas is expected to be increased to graduate level, tightened from the current A-level measure.\n\nThere will also be a narrower list of exceptions to the rules for temporary shortage visas in some industries, Cooper said, but did not give examples.\n\nCurrently, roles considered to be in short supply in the UK like carpenters, graphic designers and pharmaceutical technicians can beplaced on the Immigration Salary List (ISL),allowing employers to hire overseas workers at discount  set at 80% of the market rate.\n\nCooper said the government expects those changes will lead to a reduction of up to 50,000 fewer lower skilled visas over the course of the next year.\n\nAs well as visa changes, the home secretary added there would be new requirements for training commitments to get people who are not working back into the labour market here in the UK.\n\nPhilp  who said he agreed with the plan to end care worker recruitment from abroad  told the same programme the Conservatives would push Parliament to vote on a yearly migration cap this week.\n\nWhen asked what the cap would be, he said were working on the detail to specify that number, but it would be a further reduction of significantly more than 50,000.\n\nHe argued that if Labour had stuck with Tory changes net migration would have dropped by about 400,000.\n\nCooper also said there would be some changes to rules around international students and graduates.\n\nWe will let them continue to come and to stay and to work afterwards, she added.\n\nWe are making some changes, particularly around the standards and the compliance for universities, because, again, weve had problems where some universities havent had proper standards in place.\n\nTheyve recruited people to come as international students who then havent completed their courses, have either overstayed or other problems with compliance of the system.\n\nThe government has already tightened rules around care sector worker after coming to power last July.\n\nApplications for Health and Care Worker visas peaked at 18,300 in August 2023, then collapsed to 1,700 by April this year following the ban on bringing dependants.\n\nAnd on 9 April, an additional restriction was added requiring care firms who want to recruit anew worker from overseas to provethey attempted to recruit a worker from within England first.\n\nBut the new rules will require care companies to recruit from domestic workers or a pool of over 10,000 care workers brought to the UK on visas for jobs that never materialised.\n\nAlongside this Cooper promised to bring in a new fair pay agreement for care workers to make care jobs more attractive to UK workers and reduce overseas demand.\n\nNadra Ahmed, the National Care Associations executive chairman, told the BBC the changes would a challenging scenario for care homes even worse.\n\nShe said providers always prefer to have a domestic workforce but said it was not available.\n\nResponding to the changes, the Liberal Democrats social care spokesperson Helen Morgan said the government was tinkering around the edges yet failing to properly tackle the crisis in our social care.\n\nLabour must step up and take proper action to address recruitment shortages including paying our care workers properly and rolling out a plan for career progression, she said.\n\nWhile Labour have been reviewing migration policy for months, many have suggested this weeks crackdown was triggered by Reform UKs surge in the local elections, where ittook the Runcorn and Helsby constituency off Labour and won control of 10 councils.\n\nReform leader Nigel Farage claimed this new legislation is only happening because Reform is leading in the polls.\n\nLabours plan was doomed to fail, he argued as immigration was not just about what numbers come in but who comes in and if they can assimilate.\n\n",

EUNOR GUTI.\n\nOrdinarily, I would say, please go and see Farai, but Farai from Faramatsi Motors, Club Chambers Showroom, along 4th Street, will come to you and deliver your 2025 brand new Toyota Land Cruiser 300 Series VXR, which is fully paid for and ready for delivery, subject to the Churchs Governing Boards consent. Furthermore, please accept USD250,000 in CASH for fuel and your personal use, Chivayo wrote on his social media pages.\n\nMany implored Guti to turn down the gift, with some church members even pledging to buy the vehicle themselves, arguing that Chivayos wealth was tainted.\n\nMuch to the approval of church members and the public, Guti declined the offer.\n\nThe church accepts and encourages people to give to their God. But they must do so following strictly the teachings from our father, which are all drawn from the word of God. The word of God is sufficient for us. It is the Kingdom of God with all the treasures in it.\n\nWe are an indigenous church founded on the principle of righteousness. Our father, Professor Guti, was promoted to glory, but he left us with the Kingdom of God, which has everything that you can think of. The Kingdom of God is enough for us, said a senior church official, speaking on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe Guti family itself said it received no direct communication from Chivayo regarding the proposed donation.\n\nAs a family, we did not receive any formal communication from Mr. Chivayo. We simply became aware of the offer through social media. The matter is neither here nor there. Honouring Baba Guti should be done in a manner that is pleasing to God. The church will respond in due course, a source from the Guti family told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nChivayos gift caused quite a stir within ZAOGAs leadership, with some seeing no issue in accepting the donation. However, Guti has received praise online for refusing what many view as dirty money acquired through corruption.\n\nGuti is now the second prominent figure to decline such a lavish gift from Chivayo, following in the footsteps of legendary musician Thomas Mukanya Mapfumo, who also refused both a vehicle and a house.\n\nOther influential figures, including Sungura star Alick Macheso, Jah Prayzah, Dorcas Moyo, and Prophet Ian Ndlovu, have all accepted Chivayos gifts, leaving them at the mercy of public scrutiny.\n\nCritics have accused them of profiting from corruption while ordinary citizens suffer the consequences of failing social services, particularly public hospitals that have become little more than death traps.\n\n",

            "content": "By Sbo Gyre l Daily Maverick\n\nIVAN Mazuze is an acclaimed saxophonist whose latest offering, Penuka, exposes the depth of global influence and exchange of African culture through music.\n\nThe connections that Africa has to the rest of the world are well documented. From archaeological discoveries to food and other tangible goods brought about by trade, the plethora of threads that tie the continent to the rest of the world runs deep.Music is no exception. From the banjo, an African instrument now synonymous with American cowboy culture, and percussion drums used in many a musical ensemble, the continents contributions can be seen and equally heard.If I bring an influence of Indian music into African traditional music, its because African traditional music, even in history, has been influenced by the encounter of different traditions from other continents and still exists today, says Ivan Mazuze, acclaimed saxophonist and a forever student of jazz and other music.The Mozambique-born, Norway-based composers latest album, Penuka, delves into the profound influence of Arab and Indian cultures on African traditional music, presented through a contemporary jazz lens.The music is a testament to the centuries-old cultural exchanges facilitated by trade routes across the African continent.Mazuzes sixth studio album keeps true to his insatiable desire to blend the academia of his art form with the art itself. The score may differ in its notation, but the deep-seated and introspective themes prevail  the legacy of his musicological studies.From my debut album, I was busy with my identity. Those first five albums identify me as an African. I managed to keep reminding myself who I am through music, sound and composition, he says.This intentionality shines through his discography as his understanding of his context conjures a self-awareness personified through the music.I thought music will be a great tool to place myself in this vast industry and various tales of where we come from.But as any African will tell you, the depth of cultural richness the continent possesses makes it an endless tapestry of discovery.We are going to pass on a contribution  we cannot give it all, Mazuze explains.There are questions about globalisation and its effects on the African cultural zeitgeist. The challenge comes in finding the sweet spot that does not take away from what natives of Africa have contributed and continue to contribute.From my years in meeting people who dont come from the same cultural background as [us]  I always try to find what makes us common, the foundation that makes us human beings.Then, when it comes to technical questions like music itself, the way the music, the rhythm and the beat breathe, I find more equality than difference from my perception. Im always searching for what is common.The opening track of the LP perhaps best exemplifies this intention. Titled Bongile, meaning We are thankful or grateful in isiXhosa, his introduction to us of his sonic universe is inspired by the traditional music styles of the nomadic peoples in Indias Rajasthan state.Bongile tells a story of migration and cultural exchange, highlighting the interactions between Rajasthani culture and other cultures, including those in Africa.The vocals caress ones eardrums in an unusual yet distantly familiar way, guiding ones immersion in the music.The project also taps into the gravity that spirituality plays in this amalgamation over time. Stretching not too far away from southern Africa, songs like Mamidje pay homage to African religious practices, particularly those centred on spirit possession rituals, which are prevalent in the region.Featuring highly acclaimed Zimbabwean vocalist and guitarist Maxwell Vidima, the song specifically praises the ritual known as bira, from Zimbabwe, in which music and dance are used to invite ancestral spirits to communicate with the living.Through this composition, Mazuze pays tribute to the enduring cultural significance of these ancestral rituals and his late brother of the same name.His unwavering dedication to the continent of his birth and the power music has to transmit that pride have set him apart in his illustrious career.As an artist, what I have learnt, especially because I have travelled quite a bit, is that people and fellow musicians are interested in you and where you come from.I learnt that we often try to portray to be someone else, but societies out there are interested in where we come from. They find it interesting to listen to something else that is not a part of globalisation.Penuka means to expose in Tsonga and Mazuze has dug deep in his knowledge bank and experiences to stay true to this. His performance at this years Cape Town International Jazz Festival unveiled yet another level of a cavernous topic. But it all will be in vain if this form of archival work is not codified in some significant way. For Mazuze, this is a task that can only lay in particular hands.Governments and cultural institutions also have the responsibility of mixing commercial trading with commercial culture, he says.We have this opportunity, with all these educational institutions, to conduct more research to mark down the history we have now.

DMSbo Gyre is an entertainment specialist and freelance writer.\n\nBut as any African will tell you, the depth of cultural richness the continent possesses makes it an endless tapestry of discovery.\n\nWe are going to pass on a contribution  we cannot give it all, Mazuze explains.There are questions about globalisation and its effects on the African cultural zeitgeist. The challenge comes in finding the sweet spot that does not take away from what natives of Africa have contributed and continue to contribute.From my years in meeting people who dont come from the same cultural background as [us]  I always try to find what makes us common, the foundation that makes us human beings.Then, when it comes to technical questions like music itself, the way the music, the rhythm and the beat breathe, I find more equality than difference from my perception. Im always searching for what is common.The opening track of the LP perhaps best exemplifies this intention. Titled Bongile, meaning We are thankful or grateful in isiXhosa, his introduction to us of his sonic universe is inspired by the traditional music styles of the nomadic peoples in Indias Rajasthan state.Bongile tells a story of migration and cultural exchange, highlighting the interactions between Rajasthani culture and other cultures, including those in Africa.The vocals caress ones eardrums in an unusual yet distantly familiar way, guiding ones immersion in the music.The project also taps into the gravity that spirituality plays in this amalgamation over time. Stretching not too far away from southern Africa, songs like Mamidje pay homage to African religious practices, particularly those centred on spirit possession rituals, which are prevalent in the region.Featuring highly acclaimed Zimbabwean vocalist and guitarist Maxwell Vidima, the song specifically praises the ritual known as bira, from Zimbabwe, in which music and dance are used to invite ancestral spirits to communicate with the living.Through this composition, Mazuze pays tribute to the enduring cultural significance of these ancestral rituals and his late brother of the same name.His unwavering dedication to the continent of his birth and the power music has to transmit that pride have set him apart in his illustrious career.As an artist, what I have learnt, especially because I have travelled quite a bit, is that people and fellow musicians are interested in you and where you come from.I learnt that we often try to portray to be someone else, but societies out there are interested in where we come from. They find it interesting to listen to something else that is not a part of globalisation.Penuka means to expose in Tsonga and Mazuze has dug deep in his knowledge bank and experiences to stay true to this.
