            "content": "By Xinhua\n\nA CHINA-aided agricultural demonstration village was officially launched last week in the Shamva District of Mashonaland Central Province, Zimbabwe, to enhance agricultural productivity among rural farmers.\n\nThe demonstration village, the second of its kind set up by a Chinese agricultural expert group in the southern African country, draws inspiration from Chinas experience in poverty alleviation and aims to assist local farmers in transitioning from subsistence farming to a business-oriented approach.Dozens of households are gaining hands-on experience in sustainable farming through advanced irrigation systems, high-yielding drought-resistant seed varieties, precision farming techniques to optimize output, and integrated livestock-crop systems, according to the expert group.Speaking at the launching ceremony of the demonstration village attended by Chinese and Zimbabwean officials and local villagers, Zimbabwean Deputy Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water, and Rural Development Vangelis Haritatos said the demonstration village highlights the shared vision for agricultural transformation between the two countries.Part of the demonstration villageThis project is a testament to the enduring friendship and strategic partnership between Zimbabwe and the Peoples Republic of China, rooted in mutual respect, shared prosperity, and a common vision for sustainable development, he said, adding that capacitating rural farmers is critical for rural revitalization efforts and ensuring community development in the face of climate change.The strategic importance of this demonstration village is that this project is not just another agricultural venture; it is a living laboratory of innovation, a bridge between traditional knowledge and modern technology, and a testament to South-South cooperation, said Haritatos.On his part, Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Zhou Ding said the initiative deeply resonates with Chinas remarkable journey of development and poverty alleviation.We fully recognize that with over 60 percent of Zimbabwes population living in rural areas, it is essential to support the rural residents, especially those from marginalized and disadvantaged communities, in breaking the chains of poverty and unlocking their full potential, said Zhou.Beyond farming, the demonstration village also incorporates agro-processing facilities to add value and reduce post-harvest losses, training centers for skills transfer, renewable energy solutions, solar-powered cold storage, and processing units.Nomalisa Zindi, one of the beneficiaries, said the initiative has been pivotal in transforming subsistence farming into small businesses and creating self-sustainability.We are no longer begging or asking for something, but we are doing it for ourselves, knowing that we are working on something that will give us money for our pockets and the money to keep the project going, she said.\n\nThe demonstration village, the second of its kind set up by a Chinese agricultural expert group in the southern African country, draws inspiration from Chinas experience in poverty alleviation and aims to assist local farmers in transitioning from subsistence farming to a business-oriented approach.\n\nDozens of households are gaining hands-on experience in sustainable farming through advanced irrigation systems, high-yielding drought-resistant seed varieties, precision farming techniques to optimize output, and integrated livestock-crop systems, according to the expert group.Speaking at the launching ceremony of the demonstration village attended by Chinese and Zimbabwean officials and local villagers, Zimbabwean Deputy Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water, and Rural Development Vangelis Haritatos said the demonstration village highlights the shared vision for agricultural transformation between the two countries.Part of the demonstration villageThis project is a testament to the enduring friendship and strategic partnership between Zimbabwe and the Peoples Republic of China, rooted in mutual respect, shared prosperity, and a common vision for sustainable development, he said, adding that capacitating rural farmers is critical for rural revitalization efforts and ensuring community development in the face of climate change.The strategic importance of this demonstration village is that this project is not just another agricultural venture;

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nUNTIL Friday last week, Ashel Chibutse, a 43-year-old man and his family of five were living in a four-roomed house at Cloverdale farm in Ruwa, 25 kilometres outside Harare.\n\nChibutse is among thousands of people who, on Friday, were left out in the cold after facing a heartbreaking ordeal when their homes were demolished.\n\nSeveral families, who had resided at Cloverdale after occupying the farm belonging to former Cabinet minister Petronella Kagonye, were brutally forced out.\n\nOnce homeowners, the Cloverdale farm inhabitants now face the harsh reality of homelessness amid the biting cold, with the Harare-Mutare highway becoming their temporary shelter.\n\nI was alerted earlier in the morning that houses were being demolished while I was at work. When I was near Ruwa, thats when I was told that Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) officers were beating people, said Chibutse.\n\nThe Cloverdale farm invasions began years ago when land barons linked to the ruling party, Zanu PF, sold stands to potential homeowners for as little as US$200.\n\nThe land was allocated to the home seekers, ostensibly for supporting the ruling party, with a Zanu PF member only identified as Chairman SaMutoko at the forefront.\n\nI got my stand in February and finished construction in six months. So since August, we have been living in Cloverdale. When we came here, we were told that the stands were being given to Zanu PF youths.\n\nWe were not given any papers. We were just told to go and see Chairman SaMutokohe would give you a piece of landand true to that, I was given a stand, said Chibutse.\n\nMany families woke up to find their homes being razed down by authorities.\n\nAs some tried to stop the demolition, violence erupted, with residents and ZRP officers clashing.\n\nPolice officers were beating anyone they came across. The beatings intensified when it was reported that some police officers had been killed. They were baying for the blood of all the men, and some were beaten thoroughly, said Chibutse.\n\nWhen NewZimbabwe.com visited Cloverdale, tension was high, with ZRP details swarming the area.\n\nThe evictees believe there was injustice in the manner the demolitions were carried out arguing there was no prior warning.\n\nWe were chased by police dogs. Now we have nowhere to go. Children who were supposed to go to school are in a difficult situation. We are now destitute, and we will live here until we find accommodation, said one Ndlovu.\n\nThe Harare-Mutare highway, where they now stay, is crowded and noisy. Cars and trucks pass by constantly, making life difficult for the familiesespecially the childrenas the relentless traffic has become a temporary soundtrack to their struggles.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner atMadzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal)to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, this week we want to discuss the new law on carbon trading in Zimbabwe. What is carbon trading and may you give us background on this new law?\n\nVM: Thank you\n\nCarbon trading or emissions trading is a US$866 billion dollar global industry which involves the trading in credits or permits that represent the right to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases by companies or countries.\n\nThe government introduced on 2 May, 2025 the Carbon Trading (General) Regulations 2025 published as Statutory Instrument 48 of 2025 effectively replacing the 2023 instrument that regulated carbon trading. The regulations establish a legal framework for carbon trading in Zimbabwe.\n\nIn terms of background, our constitution guarantees every Zimbabwean to have an environment that is not harmful to health or wellbeing and a protected environment for present and future generations.\n\nZimbabwe as a signatory to the Paris Agreement and to an extent, the Kyoto Protocol, has an obligation to contribute to global climate change mitigation initiatives. That being said, our laws including the new statutory instrument introduced in accordance with the Environmental Management Act are structured to align to the global and local imperatives.\n\nReporter:What are the key issues brought in by these Carbon Trading Regulations?\n\nVM: I think of critical note is the coming in or creation of Zimbabwe Carbon Markets Authority (ZIMCA) whose mandate is to regulate, supervise and accredit participants in the carbon market and the Zimbabwe Carbon Registry for the issuance of carbon credits.\n\nIt therefore follows that the regulations have introduced mandatory registration of players involved in the carbon value chain. ZIMCA will therefore be responsible for the approval of carbon projects, monitoring compliance and authorizing the issuance of mitigation outcomes.\n\nThe regulations have maintained and introduced environmental and social safeguards through provisions for community consultation, monitoring of sustainable development, protection of biodiversity and local grievance mechanisms as a part of the consideration process.\n\nReporter: How will these regulations enhance the carbon credit market in Zimbabwe?\n\nVM: As a start, they introduce a uniform registry system and fiscal measures that will benefit the nation as a whole. The regulations require that credits be based on mitigation outcomes that are measurable and verifiable. The Zimbabwe Carbon Registry which I mentioned earlier will then operate a centralized digital platform recording the issuance, transfer and retirement of carbon credits.\n\nReporter: You mention national benefit, what benefits are likely to accrue to the nation?\n\nVM: There is a serious potential for financial inflows, if you take Gabon for instance, it signed a 10-year agreement valued at US$150 million in 2019 and received US$17 million the same year. Nigeria has the potential to make US$500 million per year from carbon trading. It is important to highlight that the two examples referred to have rainforests, however, there is significant upside of possibilities for our country, including the attended afforestation.\n\nThe regulations promote the use of local labour and infrastructural development creating jobs and decentralising economic development at the same time. Project promoters are tasked to commit 20% of revenue to community development which will likely benefit rural communities and of that 20% committed, half of is required to address essential services issues like water infrastructure, clean energy, health et cettera.\n\nIn terms of the fiscus, 30% of all proceeds from the issuance of carbon credits will be directed towards support of national development priorities through the Ministry of Finance. So the anticipated national benefit is huge.\n\nReporter: What measures are prescribed to ensure compliance?\n\nVM: Well, firstly, trading in carbon credits without a licence is an offence that may make one liable to a fine or prison for a period not exceeding 1 year. ZIMCA is empowered to make periodic unannounced inspections on project sites to confirm compliance with verification protocols and safeguard policies. It is further empowered to suspend or revoke licences for entities or persons that engage in misconduct\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima, we have to end here, because of our time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

Around 2022, in Letsitele, their remedial teacher gave them homework to write her a letter about what made them happy or sad. This exercise ultimately exposed the brutal abuse they were subjected to at their home, explained Malabi-Dzhangi.\n\nThe girls also reported that they were raped on some occasions by Zimbabwean men employed by their father at the farm, after he failed to pay them their salaries. The Zimbabwean men are still at large.\n\nFollowing their conviction, the two men mitigated their sentences, arguing that the children were brainwashed hence they were implicating them.\n\nWhen arguing for life imprisonment, Mohlaka, argued that there were no substantial and compelling factors justifying a lesser sentence as the men have demonstrated no remorse, sympathy nor empathy towards the minor victims, for their barbaric and inhumane actions.\n\n",

            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo l IOL\n\nTHE Pretoria Magistrates Court has sentenced 32-year-old Zimbabwean national, Mulero Nyangero to life imprisonment after he was convicted of rape.\n\nNyangero, who was residing in Pretoria West, was slapped with a further five years direct imprisonment sentence for robbery with aggravating circumstances.\n\nGauteng spokesperson for the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA), Lumka Mahanjana said the court ordered that the sentences should run concurrently, and that Nyangero be declared unfit to possess a firearm.\n\nOn 14 August 2020 in the afternoon, the victim was running on Kloof Street in Pretoria West, when three men came out of the nearby bush, approached, and dragged her into the bushes where Nyangero raped her, said Mahanjana.\n\nWhile Nyangero was raping her, the other two men were assaulting her and they threatened her with a knife.\n\nThereafter, they forced her to transfer money to them via cellphone banking, tied her hands and fled the scene, she said.\n\nThe victim later managed to untie herself, ran to the road, where she got a lift home from a vehicle which was passing by.\n\nThereafter, she went to Pretoria West police station, where she reported the matter.\n\nAfter investigations, Nyangero was arrested on 21 February 2021 at a tavern in Pretoria West and has been in custody since.\n\nIn court, Nyangero pleaded not guilty to the charges preferred against him and denied ever committing the offences.\n\nHowever, state prosecutor Advocate Chester Molaba presented compelling evidence by the investigating officers and the victim, which proved that indeed Nyangero committed the offences.\n\nDuring sentencing proceedings, through his legal representative, Nyangero asked the court to deviate from imposing the prescribed minimum sentences because he is married and has two minor children that he needs to provide and care for, said Mahanjana.\n\nFurthermore, he asked the court to consider the fact that he has been in custody for four years since his arrest in 2021.\n\nMolaba, however, argued against the deviation from the prescribed minimum sentence of life imprisonment, stating that Nyangero had showed no remorse for the serious crimes of gender-based violence he committed, which are prevalent in South Africa.\n\nFurthermore, Molaba argued that the offences committed by Nyangero were inhumane, vicious, and brutal against a defenceless woman.\n\nIn delivering the judgment, Magistrate Themba Ndwandwe agreed with the state that the crimes committed by Nyangero were inhumane and that he had shown no remorse.\n\nFurthermore, the magistrate noted that Nyangero had no respect for women because he treated the victim like an animal.\n\nIn the end, the court found that there were no substantial and compelling circumstances to deviate from imposing the prescribed minimum sentence of life in prison.\n\nMeanwhile, Acting Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) in Gauteng, advocate Marika Jansen Van Vuuren, has welcomed the sentences, and applauded the work of the prosecutor and the investigating officer, Captain Mkhonto, which led to the conviction.\n\nShe added that she hopes the sentence reaffirms the NPAs commitment to tackling crimes of gender-based violence.\n\nLast year, IOL reported that a 28-year-old man from Akasia, Pretoria, was sentenced to life imprisonment for raping his girlfriends 12-year-old sister.\n\nThe man was sentenced to life behind bars at the Pretoria North Magistrates Court.\n\nThe rapist cannot be named to protect the identity of the victim.\n\nThe little girl was raped in July 2021 when she had visited her sister, who resides in Akasia, where she was staying with her boyfriend.\n\n",

This act of faith led to a miraculous catch.The power of Gods word lies in its ability to transcend human understanding. Its not about conventional or scientific logic or reason; its about trusting in the One who speaks.As Romans 1:17 says, The just shall live by faith. Faith is the language of Gods operation, and its the only way to please Him (Hebrews 11:6).Jesus emphasises the importance of faith in Mark 11:22-24. He tells His disciples to have faith in God and assures them that whatever they ask for in prayer, believing theyll receive it, will be theirs. This is not just a suggestion; its a command. Jesus wants us to trust Him completely, without questioning His ways.But how do we develop this kind of faith? The answer lies in Gods word. As Psalm 119:160 says, The entirety of Your word is truth. We must immerse ourselves in Scripture, allowing its truth to transform our minds and hearts. We must learn to trust Gods word, even when it seems foolish or contradictory to our scientific knowledge or circumstances.So, lets approach Gods word with faith, not questioning its logic or reasonableness. Lets talk to Him through His word and prayer, trusting that He will guide us and bless us. Lets cast our nets deeper into the waters of Gods blessings, trusting in His word and His faithfulness.As we close, remember that faith is not a feeling; its a choice. Choose to trust Gods word today, and watch Him work miracles in your life.PRAYER:Dear Heavenly Father, we thank You for the power of Your word. Help us to trust in You, even when Your ways seem foolish to us. Give us the faith to take You at Your word, and may we experience the miraculous blessings that come from obeying Your instructions.

Her family moved to Chatsworth in 1966 due to the Group Areas Act.I had one of the best childhoods  growing up in a home filled with love and happiness. We were also quite a large family, and our extended family visited us often. My cousins were always at our home during the holidays.We also lived in a closed-knit community where everyone knew one another. My dad, Moolchand Badal, was involved in community work and was a founding member of the Friends of the Sick Association. I remember going with him to visit families in the community at the weekend.I also remember watching the Japanese Gardens being built. We played around the area, not realising that people would soon be losing their homes. However, we were among the last families to be moved. My dad fought alongside other residents against this. They fought long and hard  until we had no choice but to leave, she said.EducationKanaye said she completed Standard 5 (Grade 7) at the Sir Kurma Reddy State aided Indian School, before the family moved to Chatsworth.The school was across the road from my home. It was not only our place for learning, but also a venue for all community activities such as sporting events and plays.The school was also quite full with limited classrooms. Over the years, I remember there were times when we had our lessons under a tree or at our local temple. The classes held at the temple were the most exciting as I got to walk a distance away from my home and chat to my friends. Whenever there were festivals at the temple, we also got to enjoy the food, she said.Kanaye said she completed Standard 6 at a primary school in Chatsworth, and then attended Standard 7 at the Chatsworth Number Seven High School in Westcliff.We were moved to Havenside, which did not have a high school at the time. However, the following year, Southlands Secondary School opened, which I attended until I completed matric in 1972. My favourite subjects were English and Latin Further studies and careerKanaye said she completed a diploma in lower secondary education at the Springfield Teachers Training College.I initially did my first year of studies at the University of Durban-Westville before completing the other two years at the college. I really enjoyed studying, especially English, and looked forward to becoming a teacher.Kanaye said she first taught at a primary school in Chatsworth in 1976.After a year, she taught at a school in Phoenix.Kanaye with her children, Sharvedh and Divashya, before finding out they were deaf.She married Dr Krishna Kanaye, a general practitioner in September 1976. He passed away from Covid-19 in August 2020.Kanaye said shortly after getting married, she fell pregnant with her daughter, Divashya, now 48, and about a year-and-a-half later with her son, Sharvedh, now 46.After marriage, we moved to Verulam due to my husbands work. I began teaching at a school. However, I left work when I was about six months pregnant with my daughter as I was quite ill. I enjoyed being at home with my children. They were healthy and were reaching their milestones. I would never have thought what would come next.Divashya must have been about a year-and-a-half when we realised something was not right. She was playing with the TV remote and had turned the volume on full, but did not react. My husband and I took her to a specialist, who confirmed she was deaf, she said.Kanaye before discovering that both her children were deafKanaye said at that time, she and her husband felt as if their world had come crashing down.We were distraught. We didnt know any people, especially those who were role-models that were deaf. We only knew those from the charities we assisted. I was mourning as if I lost a loved one, but it was in fact for my childrens future.We then went to Cape Town to get a second opinion, and attend a programme on how to deal with a deaf child, including communication skills. We were encouraged to talk to our children so they could be vocal. I was told to teach my child, who was profoundly deaf, how to speak, and not use sign language  which would make her lazy.At the end of the programme, I was approached by the doctor who said I should also test my son. He was just a few months old, but I did it. He, too, was confirmed to be deaf. I had to take in all of this information, but still remain composed for the sake of my children. But all I wanted to do was cry, she said.Return to teachingKanaye said she joined the VN Naik School for the Deaf in 1984.Both my children were attending the school and I was quite the active parent  assisting where I could. So when the principal offered me a job, I accepted. The school had also introduced sign language, which I wasnt too keen about as I kept thinking about the professionals who said it was for low-functioning persons. They always said that success meant a child who could vocalise themselves. However, I soon realised that was not so.I remember there was a young man, who was deaf, but was working in one of the departments at a university. I thought to myself, he is deaf but a professional. He came to the school to speak about sign language . After that, I can say he made me completely change my mind about it.Moving abroadKanaye said to give her children the opportunity to further their education, she decided to pursue her Masters degree in the US.My husband and I wanted to make sure they had every opportunity to enable them to become independent. We were not going to let anything hold them back, and that meant also furthering their education. However, at the time there were no tertiary institutions for the deaf in South Africa.It so happened that the principal and a teacher at the school had gone to the US to attend Gallaudet University in Washington DC  which is the worlds leading institution for the deaf and hard of hearing. We decided to visit the university to see if it would be suitable, and it was.In 1994, I applied to study at the university to do a Masters degree in advanced deaf education. Prior to this, I had completed a diploma in special education, and a degree in English and psychology, both through Unisa.I also applied for Divashya to be enrolled in the pre-college programme, and for Sharvedh to complete his high school  which was also offered on the universitys campus. This would give them the opportunity to thereafter study at the university, she said.Kanaye said after completing the degree, she taught English to foreign deaf students at the university.I needed to stay another year as my son needed to still complete his final year of high school.At the time, he was my dependant, and would have to return to South Africa with me if I left. So I worked for that year.Kanaye said she returned to South Africa while her children completed their degrees at the university.Divashya completed a BSc in accounting and she graduated magna cum laude. She is currently a professional accountant.Sharvedh completed a BSc in economics and science. He currently lives in the US and works as an analyst in a department of the federal government.In those early days, I cried over my childrens future. I never thought that today, my heart would be filled with so much happiness.As a mother, the greatest joy is seeing your children happy and successful. It also shows that nothing is impossible or unachievable when you remain determined.Afrikaner refugee in the US:I left my five-bedroom house, dogs and mother behindKanaye said she was approached to assist with a flagship IT programme for the deaf at the then ML Sultan Technical College in 2000.I co-ordinated the programme which meant making sure there were sign language interpreters. I also assisted with the interpreting when needed.One of the highlights was seeing the children who were in my form class at the VN Naik School for the Deaf  before I left for the US  join the programme. It was a full-circle moment.Kanaye said after 20 years at the college, she retired in January 2020.RetirementKanaye, who serves as the deputy president of the KZN Blind and Deaf Society, said she now enjoyed being involved in its various activities.I was always involved with the society, from the time I taught at the school.However, when I started assisting at the college, I became a member. Over the years, I have been quite involved, including developing the course and teaching manuals for the sign language classes that the society has every Saturday.If I am not doing work with society, I enjoy reading, gardening, cooking or spending time with friends and family, she said.(Kanaye has submitted her story for volume eight of the coffee table publication, Tell Your Mothers Story.

They always said that success meant a child who could vocalise themselves. However, I soon realised that was not so.I remember there was a young man, who was deaf, but was working in one of the departments at a university. I thought to myself, he is deaf but a professional. He came to the school to speak about sign language . After that, I can say he made me completely change my mind about it.Moving abroadKanaye said to give her children the opportunity to further their education, she decided to pursue her Masters degree in the US.My husband and I wanted to make sure they had every opportunity to enable them to become independent. We were not going to let anything hold them back, and that meant also furthering their education. However, at the time there were no tertiary institutions for the deaf in South Africa.It so happened that the principal and a teacher at the school had gone to the US to attend Gallaudet University in Washington DC  which is the worlds leading institution for the deaf and hard of hearing. We decided to visit the university to see if it would be suitable, and it was.In 1994, I applied to study at the university to do a Masters degree in advanced deaf education. Prior to this, I had completed a diploma in special education, and a degree in English and psychology, both through Unisa.I also applied for Divashya to be enrolled in the pre-college programme, and for Sharvedh to complete his high school  which was also offered on the universitys campus. This would give them the opportunity to thereafter study at the university, she said.Kanaye said after completing the degree, she taught English to foreign deaf students at the university.I needed to stay another year as my son needed to still complete his final year of high school.At the time, he was my dependant, and would have to return to South Africa with me if I left. So I worked for that year.Kanaye said she returned to South Africa while her children completed their degrees at the university.Divashya completed a BSc in accounting and she graduated magna cum laude. She is currently a professional accountant.Sharvedh completed a BSc in economics and science. He currently lives in the US and works as an analyst in a department of the federal government.In those early days, I cried over my childrens future. I never thought that today, my heart would be filled with so much happiness.As a mother, the greatest joy is seeing your children happy and successful. It also shows that nothing is impossible or unachievable when you remain determined.Afrikaner refugee in the US:I left my five-bedroom house, dogs and mother behindKanaye said she was approached to assist with a flagship IT programme for the deaf at the then ML Sultan Technical College in 2000.I co-ordinated the programme which meant making sure there were sign language interpreters.

The publication, of which Dr Kogielam Archary is the series editor, is part of a flagship programme of the Oral History of South Africa Association).\n\nChildhood\n\nKanaye, the second youngest of eight children, was born and raised in Riverside, Durban North. Her family moved to Chatsworth in 1966 due to the Group Areas Act.I had one of the best childhoods  growing up in a home filled with love and happiness. We were also quite a large family, and our extended family visited us often. My cousins were always at our home during the holidays.We also lived in a closed-knit community where everyone knew one another. My dad, Moolchand Badal, was involved in community work and was a founding member of the Friends of the Sick Association. I remember going with him to visit families in the community at the weekend.I also remember watching the Japanese Gardens being built. We played around the area, not realising that people would soon be losing their homes. However, we were among the last families to be moved. My dad fought alongside other residents against this. They fought long and hard  until we had no choice but to leave, she said.EducationKanaye said she completed Standard 5 (Grade 7) at the Sir Kurma Reddy State aided Indian School, before the family moved to Chatsworth.The school was across the road from my home. It was not only our place for learning, but also a venue for all community activities such as sporting events and plays.The school was also quite full with limited classrooms. Over the years, I remember there were times when we had our lessons under a tree or at our local temple. The classes held at the temple were the most exciting as I got to walk a distance away from my home and chat to my friends. Whenever there were festivals at the temple, we also got to enjoy the food, she said.Kanaye said she completed Standard 6 at a primary school in Chatsworth, and then attended Standard 7 at the Chatsworth Number Seven High School in Westcliff.We were moved to Havenside, which did not have a high school at the time. However, the following year, Southlands Secondary School opened, which I attended until I completed matric in 1972. My favourite subjects were English and Latin Further studies and careerKanaye said she completed a diploma in lower secondary education at the Springfield Teachers Training College.I initially did my first year of studies at the University of Durban-Westville before completing the other two years at the college. I really enjoyed studying, especially English, and looked forward to becoming a teacher.Kanaye said she first taught at a primary school in Chatsworth in 1976.After a year, she taught at a school in Phoenix.Kanaye with her children, Sharvedh and Divashya, before finding out they were deaf.She married Dr Krishna Kanaye, a general practitioner in September 1976. He passed away from Covid-19 in August 2020.Kanaye said shortly after getting married, she fell pregnant with her daughter, Divashya, now 48, and about a year-and-a-half later with her son, Sharvedh, now 46.After marriage, we moved to Verulam due to my husbands work. I began teaching at a school. However, I left work when I was about six months pregnant with my daughter as I was quite ill. I enjoyed being at home with my children. They were healthy and were reaching their milestones. I would never have thought what would come next.Divashya must have been about a year-and-a-half when we realised something was not right. She was playing with the TV remote and had turned the volume on full, but did not react. My husband and I took her to a specialist, who confirmed she was deaf, she said.Kanaye before discovering that both her children were deafKanaye said at that time, she and her husband felt as if their world had come crashing down.We were distraught. We didnt know any people, especially those who were role-models that were deaf. We only knew those from the charities we assisted. I was mourning as if I lost a loved one, but it was in fact for my childrens future.We then went to Cape Town to get a second opinion, and attend a programme on how to deal with a deaf child, including communication skills. We were encouraged to talk to our children so they could be vocal. I was told to teach my child, who was profoundly deaf, how to speak, and not use sign language  which would make her lazy.At the end of the programme, I was approached by the doctor who said I should also test my son. He was just a few months old, but I did it. He, too, was confirmed to be deaf. I had to take in all of this information, but still remain composed for the sake of my children. But all I wanted to do was cry, she said.Return to teachingKanaye said she joined the VN Naik School for the Deaf in 1984.Both my children were attending the school and I was quite the active parent  assisting where I could.

We decided to visit the university to see if it would be suitable, and it was.In 1994, I applied to study at the university to do a Masters degree in advanced deaf education. Prior to this, I had completed a diploma in special education, and a degree in English and psychology, both through Unisa.I also applied for Divashya to be enrolled in the pre-college programme, and for Sharvedh to complete his high school  which was also offered on the universitys campus. This would give them the opportunity to thereafter study at the university, she said.Kanaye said after completing the degree, she taught English to foreign deaf students at the university.I needed to stay another year as my son needed to still complete his final year of high school.At the time, he was my dependant, and would have to return to South Africa with me if I left. So I worked for that year.Kanaye said she returned to South Africa while her children completed their degrees at the university.Divashya completed a BSc in accounting and she graduated magna cum laude. She is currently a professional accountant.Sharvedh completed a BSc in economics and science.

We played around the area, not realising that people would soon be losing their homes. However, we were among the last families to be moved. My dad fought alongside other residents against this. They fought long and hard  until we had no choice but to leave, she said.\n\nEducationKanaye said she completed Standard 5 (Grade 7) at the Sir Kurma Reddy State aided Indian School, before the family moved to Chatsworth.The school was across the road from my home. It was not only our place for learning, but also a venue for all community activities such as sporting events and plays.The school was also quite full with limited classrooms. Over the years, I remember there were times when we had our lessons under a tree or at our local temple. The classes held at the temple were the most exciting as I got to walk a distance away from my home and chat to my friends. Whenever there were festivals at the temple, we also got to enjoy the food, she said.Kanaye said she completed Standard 6 at a primary school in Chatsworth, and then attended Standard 7 at the Chatsworth Number Seven High School in Westcliff.We were moved to Havenside, which did not have a high school at the time. However, the following year, Southlands Secondary School opened, which I attended until I completed matric in 1972. My favourite subjects were English and Latin Further studies and careerKanaye said she completed a diploma in lower secondary education at the Springfield Teachers Training College.I initially did my first year of studies at the University of Durban-Westville before completing the other two years at the college.

He passed away from Covid-19 in August 2020.Kanaye said shortly after getting married, she fell pregnant with her daughter, Divashya, now 48, and about a year-and-a-half later with her son, Sharvedh, now 46.After marriage, we moved to Verulam due to my husbands work. I began teaching at a school. However, I left work when I was about six months pregnant with my daughter as I was quite ill. I enjoyed being at home with my children. They were healthy and were reaching their milestones. I would never have thought what would come next.Divashya must have been about a year-and-a-half when we realised something was not right. She was playing with the TV remote and had turned the volume on full, but did not react. My husband and I took her to a specialist, who confirmed she was deaf, she said.Kanaye before discovering that both her children were deafKanaye said at that time, she and her husband felt as if their world had come crashing down.We were distraught. We didnt know any people, especially those who were role-models that were deaf. We only knew those from the charities we assisted. I was mourning as if I lost a loved one, but it was in fact for my childrens future.We then went to Cape Town to get a second opinion, and attend a programme on how to deal with a deaf child, including communication skills. We were encouraged to talk to our children so they could be vocal. I was told to teach my child, who was profoundly deaf, how to speak, and not use sign language  which would make her lazy.At the end of the programme, I was approached by the doctor who said I should also test my son. He was just a few months old, but I did it. He, too, was confirmed to be deaf. I had to take in all of this information, but still remain composed for the sake of my children. But all I wanted to do was cry, she said.Return to teachingKanaye said she joined the VN Naik School for the Deaf in 1984.Both my children were attending the school and I was quite the active parent  assisting where I could. So when the principal offered me a job, I accepted. The school had also introduced sign language, which I wasnt too keen about as I kept thinking about the professionals who said it was for low-functioning persons. They always said that success meant a child who could vocalise themselves. However, I soon realised that was not so.I remember there was a young man, who was deaf, but was working in one of the departments at a university. I thought to myself, he is deaf but a professional.

This would give them the opportunity to thereafter study at the university, she said.Kanaye said after completing the degree, she taught English to foreign deaf students at the university.I needed to stay another year as my son needed to still complete his final year of high school.At the time, he was my dependant, and would have to return to South Africa with me if I left. So I worked for that year.Kanaye said she returned to South Africa while her children completed their degrees at the university.Divashya completed a BSc in accounting and she graduated magna cum laude. She is currently a professional accountant.Sharvedh completed a BSc in economics and science. He currently lives in the US and works as an analyst in a department of the federal government.In those early days, I cried over my childrens future. I never thought that today, my heart would be filled with so much happiness.As a mother, the greatest joy is seeing your children happy and successful.

She was playing with the TV remote and had turned the volume on full, but did not react. My husband and I took her to a specialist, who confirmed she was deaf, she said.\n\nKanaye before discovering that both her children were deaf\n\nKanaye said at that time, she and her husband felt as if their world had come crashing down.\n\nWe were distraught. We didnt know any people, especially those who were role-models that were deaf. We only knew those from the charities we assisted. I was mourning as if I lost a loved one, but it was in fact for my childrens future.We then went to Cape Town to get a second opinion, and attend a programme on how to deal with a deaf child, including communication skills. We were encouraged to talk to our children so they could be vocal. I was told to teach my child, who was profoundly deaf, how to speak, and not use sign language  which would make her lazy.At the end of the programme, I was approached by the doctor who said I should also test my son. He was just a few months old, but I did it. He, too, was confirmed to be deaf. I had to take in all of this information, but still remain composed for the sake of my children. But all I wanted to do was cry, she said.Return to teachingKanaye said she joined the VN Naik School for the Deaf in 1984.Both my children were attending the school and I was quite the active parent  assisting where I could. So when the principal offered me a job, I accepted. The school had also introduced sign language, which I wasnt too keen about as I kept thinking about the professionals who said it was for low-functioning persons. They always said that success meant a child who could vocalise themselves. However, I soon realised that was not so.I remember there was a young man, who was deaf, but was working in one of the departments at a university. I thought to myself, he is deaf but a professional. He came to the school to speak about sign language . After that, I can say he made me completely change my mind about it.Moving abroadKanaye said to give her children the opportunity to further their education, she decided to pursue her Masters degree in the US.My husband and I wanted to make sure they had every opportunity to enable them to become independent. We were not going to let anything hold them back, and that meant also furthering their education. However, at the time there were no tertiary institutions for the deaf in South Africa.It so happened that the principal and a teacher at the school had gone to the US to attend Gallaudet University in Washington DC  which is the worlds leading institution for the deaf and hard of hearing.

I thought to myself, he is deaf but a professional. He came to the school to speak about sign language . After that, I can say he made me completely change my mind about it.\n\nMoving abroadKanaye said to give her children the opportunity to further their education, she decided to pursue her Masters degree in the US.My husband and I wanted to make sure they had every opportunity to enable them to become independent.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZIM dancehall artist Jimmy Mudereri, also known as Silent Killer, is facing a demand for US$122,170 from Y2K Entertainment, the organisers of the UK SAMA Festival, following his failure to attend the event in April 2025.\n\nSilent killer, missed the festival after refusing to board a flight, citing a troubling dream about an airplane explosion.Despite checking in at Robert Mugabe International Airport, he backed out at the last minute, the event organisers bought a second flight ticket costing $1,500, but he locked himself in a toilet to avoid boarding.Y2K Entertainment claims that Silent Killer breached his performance contract, resulting in significant financial losses and reputational damage.The festival was scheduled for 19 and 20 April, 2025.In a letter of demand gleaned by NewZimbabwe.com, Y2K allege that they incurred substantial expenses, including cost of three airfare tickets and various payments made to facilitate his travel and Visa application.It is alleged that your client brazenly breached the terms of the contract, displayed unprofessional conduct in many ways; especially by his none attendance and failure to fulfill his contractual obligations causing huge financial loss and reputational damage to our clients.The brief circumstances and our clients case against yours can be crystalised as follows; a. Client alleges that they sent Silent Killer US$300 to enable him to obtain an emergency passport sometime in 2024.Our clients allege that they incurred huge financial loses as a result of your clients alleged unprofessional conduct. Clients had to buy Silent Killer a total of three air plane tickets to the United Kingdom. It is alleged that your client caused the delay in the application for his Visa; he had not disclosed to our clients that his passport had been held somewhere because he allegedly owed about US$580. It was through clients agents efforts that the passport was subsequently retrieved after client had sent US$500, which Silent Killer allegedly pocketed.Clients allege that it was extremely difficult to get Silent Killer to cooperate and attend the Visa application interview. It is alleged that Silent Killer even arrived late for the first Visa application interview and clients had to book him a second interview, all at their expense.Due to the late interviews, Silent Killers Visa only came out on the day he was scheduled to fly to the United Kingdom but it was now too late hence why he could not board the first scheduled plane. Clients went on to buy two other air plane ticket for Silent Killer and he still failed to honor his contractual obligations.According to the performance contract agreement, it was agreed by both parties that Silent Killer would be given an initial deposit of US$500 prior to his departure to the United Kingdom. Upon arrival in the United Kingdom, Silent Killer was to be given his outstanding balance of US$2,000 to make a total of US$2,500 as per the terms of their agreement.Clients allege that Silent Killer was given the agreed initial deposit of US$500 and several other sums of monies which were to be deducted from the US$2,000, which he was meant to be given upon arrival in the United Kingdom. We have been shown a video footage wherein Silent Killer was acknowledging to Mr Fred Matenga that he had been given the US$500 initial deposit as per their agreement, which he was flagging on camera. Your client in the same video footage confirmed the material terms of their agreement as outlined above as regards the agreed payment terms.We are instructed by our clients that notwithstanding the above, upon arrival at RG Mugabe Airport on 18 April 2025, your client, after our clients agent had checked him in; subsequently refused to disembark the car and board the initial 3pm flight that had been booked for him. He was left by the plane after he refused to come out of the car at RG Mugabe Airport.It is alleged that upon arrival at the airport your client had started making a fresh demand of a US$300 payment which he alleged he wanted to leave with his girlfriend or wife. Notwithstanding the fact that this demand was outside their agreed terms and contract, client sent the US300 to one Diva who was with Silent Killer and had been the middle men between the parties. But still he refused to disembark the car, board the plane and was left by the plane knowing fully well how his actions were further prejudicing our clients and the grave consequences that would ensue. The US$300 was however subsequently sent back to our client after Silent Killer failed to board the plane.It is further alleged that your client asked our clients to book him another flight after giving them the impression that he was remorseful for his conduct and was desirous to honor his contractual obligations. Clients proceeded to book yours another ticket for a 6pm flight on the same day.Client alleges that even after buying a second air ticket, Silent Killer made a new further demand for another payment outside their agreed contract terms. It is alleged he first made an unreasonable and startling demand for the money which he said was due to his DJ, who was never a party to the contract and was not travelling with him to the UK. Upon realising that this demand was opposed and could not be entertained, it is alleged that Silent Killer then started arguing that clients should not have booked him a 6pm flight but a Saturday morning 1am flight instead.It is further alleged that Silent Killer then started claiming that he would never board the 6pm plane because he had had a dream whereby the plane had exploded. Clients further allege that instead of going to check in so as to board the 6pm flight, Silent Killer was invited and chose to go and eat food at a restaurant within the RG Mugabe Airport and once again failed to check in and was left by the second plane on 18 April 2025, reads the letter.As a result of silent killers failure to perform, the organisers said they had to find a last-minute replacement artist, Oriyano, leading to additional expenses and a diminished audience turnout.As a result of your clients failure to board the plane to the United Kingdom, our clients had to make an alternative, unplanned arrangement to rope in Oriyano to come on board as he was in the United Kingdom at the material time. Clients had to pay Oriyano for his performance.Clients show had a lesser attendance due to Silent Killers none attendance. Silent Killers fans chose to not attend the event in protest and client lost potential revenue.Further to that, it is alleged that your client went on to make several misleading, damaging allegations against our clients in his podcast interview; which allegations have caused our clients serious reputational damage. Their good names and brand has been dealt a fatal blow as a result of the alleged disinformation by your client.For the record, your client had been given more than the US$500 which he was supposed to have been given before he boarded the plane to the United Kingdom as per the performance agreement with contract. Your client had received and withdrew in advance a total of US$1,500 before he even left Zimbabwe, reads the letter.Y2K Entertainment has instructed silent killer to pay the full amount of US$122,170 for the damages he made, and to be paid within seven days, failing which they will pursue legal action.It is against this background that clients have instructed us to write this letter of demand. Clients have instructed us to demand from your client;a. damages for soiling clients reputation b. compensation for the breach of contract and none performance of contractual obligations by your client c. reimbursement of all monies advanced to your client and used for airplane ticket purchases.For the record, we are instructed by our client that the breakdown of the amount being claimed is as follows;US$300 given to Silent Killer for an emergency passport last year, 2024.US$500 deposit given to Silent Killer as per the terms of their performance contract agreement.US$500 given to Silent Killer to collect or recover his passport from the lodge /guest house.US$100 given to Silent Killer for maintenance when he claimed he had been arrested for defaulting maintenance.US$100-00 given to Silent Killer to attend Visa application biometrics.GBP 1273.40/US$ $1,693.62 for initial ticket which was later changed due to late submission of passport by Silent Killer and late visa application.GBP 435.00/ USD$578.55 being the cost for ticket itinerary changes.GBP 1534.00 / USD $2,040.22 being the new ticket purchase after the no show-Ethiopian airlines ticket.A total of 4,500/ USD $5,985 paid to the replacement artist Oriyano (2500) and his promoter (2000).Accommodation 280/ US$$372.40.Loss of income due none appearance by Silent Killer US$10,000.Damage to Y2K and Fred Matenga US$100,000.We are instructed by our client to demand, as we hereby do; that you pay the sum of USD122, 170 (One hundred and Twenty-two thousand one hundred and seventy United States Dollars) which amount is now due to our client and must be paid within seven (7) days of being served with this letter. You are also further expected to pay US$12, 217 (Twelve Thousand Two Hundred and seventeen United Stated dollars) being our collection commission.Now therefore, in accordance with our clients instruction, this therefore serves as FORMAL NOTICE that you MUST settle the amount due at our offices that is Office No. 10, 3D Complex Centre, Strathaven Shops, Harare in the next seven (7) calendar days; and failure to pay will result in summons being issued against you without further reference to you. In that event all costs of recovery shall be on your account. We however hope that this shall not be necessary, reads the letter.\n\nSilent killer, missed the festival after refusing to board a flight, citing a troubling dream about an airplane explosion.\n\nDespite checking in at Robert Mugabe International Airport, he backed out at the last minute, the event organisers bought a second flight ticket costing $1,500, but he locked himself in a toilet to avoid boarding.Y2K Entertainment claims that Silent Killer breached his performance contract, resulting in significant financial losses and reputational damage.The festival was scheduled for 19 and 20 April, 2025.In a letter of demand gleaned by NewZimbabwe.com, Y2K allege that they incurred substantial expenses, including cost of three airfare tickets and various payments made to facilitate his travel and Visa application.It is alleged that your client brazenly breached the terms of the contract, displayed unprofessional conduct in many ways; especially by his none attendance and failure to fulfill his contractual obligations causing huge financial loss and reputational damage to our clients.The brief circumstances and our clients case against yours can be crystalised as follows; a.

It was through clients agents efforts that the passport was subsequently retrieved after client had sent US$500, which Silent Killer allegedly pocketed.Clients allege that it was extremely difficult to get Silent Killer to cooperate and attend the Visa application interview. It is alleged that Silent Killer even arrived late for the first Visa application interview and clients had to book him a second interview, all at their expense.Due to the late interviews, Silent Killers Visa only came out on the day he was scheduled to fly to the United Kingdom but it was now too late hence why he could not board the first scheduled plane.

In that event all costs of recovery shall be on your account. We however hope that this shall not be necessary, reads the letter.\n\nIt is alleged that your client brazenly breached the terms of the contract, displayed unprofessional conduct in many ways; especially by his none attendance and failure to fulfill his contractual obligations causing huge financial loss and reputational damage to our clients.\n\nThe brief circumstances and our clients case against yours can be crystalised as follows; a. Client alleges that they sent Silent Killer US$300 to enable him to obtain an emergency passport sometime in 2024.Our clients allege that they incurred huge financial loses as a result of your clients alleged unprofessional conduct. Clients had to buy Silent Killer a total of three air plane tickets to the United Kingdom. It is alleged that your client caused the delay in the application for his Visa; he had not disclosed to our clients that his passport had been held somewhere because he allegedly owed about US$580. It was through clients agents efforts that the passport was subsequently retrieved after client had sent US$500, which Silent Killer allegedly pocketed.Clients allege that it was extremely difficult to get Silent Killer to cooperate and attend the Visa application interview. It is alleged that Silent Killer even arrived late for the first Visa application interview and clients had to book him a second interview, all at their expense.Due to the late interviews, Silent Killers Visa only came out on the day he was scheduled to fly to the United Kingdom but it was now too late hence why he could not board the first scheduled plane. Clients went on to buy two other air plane ticket for Silent Killer and he still failed to honor his contractual obligations.According to the performance contract agreement, it was agreed by both parties that Silent Killer would be given an initial deposit of US$500 prior to his departure to the United Kingdom. Upon arrival in the United Kingdom, Silent Killer was to be given his outstanding balance of US$2,000 to make a total of US$2,500 as per the terms of their agreement.Clients allege that Silent Killer was given the agreed initial deposit of US$500 and several other sums of monies which were to be deducted from the US$2,000, which he was meant to be given upon arrival in the United Kingdom. We have been shown a video footage wherein Silent Killer was acknowledging to Mr Fred Matenga that he had been given the US$500 initial deposit as per their agreement, which he was flagging on camera. Your client in the same video footage confirmed the material terms of their agreement as outlined above as regards the agreed payment terms.We are instructed by our clients that notwithstanding the above, upon arrival at RG Mugabe Airport on 18 April 2025, your client, after our clients agent had checked him in; subsequently refused to disembark the car and board the initial 3pm flight that had been booked for him. He was left by the plane after he refused to come out of the car at RG Mugabe Airport.It is alleged that upon arrival at the airport your client had started making a fresh demand of a US$300 payment which he alleged he wanted to leave with his girlfriend or wife. Notwithstanding the fact that this demand was outside their agreed terms and contract, client sent the US300 to one Diva who was with Silent Killer and had been the middle men between the parties. But still he refused to disembark the car, board the plane and was left by the plane knowing fully well how his actions were further prejudicing our clients and the grave consequences that would ensue. The US$300 was however subsequently sent back to our client after Silent Killer failed to board the plane.It is further alleged that your client asked our clients to book him another flight after giving them the impression that he was remorseful for his conduct and was desirous to honor his contractual obligations. Clients proceeded to book yours another ticket for a 6pm flight on the same day.Client alleges that even after buying a second air ticket, Silent Killer made a new further demand for another payment outside their agreed contract terms. It is alleged he first made an unreasonable and startling demand for the money which he said was due to his DJ, who was never a party to the contract and was not travelling with him to the UK. Upon realising that this demand was opposed and could not be entertained, it is alleged that Silent Killer then started arguing that clients should not have booked him a 6pm flight but a Saturday morning 1am flight instead.It is further alleged that Silent Killer then started claiming that he would never board the 6pm plane because he had had a dream whereby the plane had exploded. Clients further allege that instead of going to check in so as to board the 6pm flight, Silent Killer was invited and chose to go and eat food at a restaurant within the RG Mugabe Airport and once again failed to check in and was left by the second plane on 18 April 2025, reads the letter.As a result of silent killers failure to perform, the organisers said they had to find a last-minute replacement artist, Oriyano, leading to additional expenses and a diminished audience turnout.As a result of your clients failure to board the plane to the United Kingdom, our clients had to make an alternative, unplanned arrangement to rope in Oriyano to come on board as he was in the United Kingdom at the material time. Clients had to pay Oriyano for his performance.Clients show had a lesser attendance due to Silent Killers none attendance. Silent Killers fans chose to not attend the event in protest and client lost potential revenue.Further to that, it is alleged that your client went on to make several misleading, damaging allegations against our clients in his podcast interview; which allegations have caused our clients serious reputational damage. Their good names and brand has been dealt a fatal blow as a result of the alleged disinformation by your client.For the record, your client had been given more than the US$500 which he was supposed to have been given before he boarded the plane to the United Kingdom as per the performance agreement with contract.

Clients went on to buy two other air plane ticket for Silent Killer and he still failed to honor his contractual obligations.\n\nAccording to the performance contract agreement, it was agreed by both parties that Silent Killer would be given an initial deposit of US$500 prior to his departure to the United Kingdom. Upon arrival in the United Kingdom, Silent Killer was to be given his outstanding balance of US$2,000 to make a total of US$2,500 as per the terms of their agreement.Clients allege that Silent Killer was given the agreed initial deposit of US$500 and several other sums of monies which were to be deducted from the US$2,000, which he was meant to be given upon arrival in the United Kingdom. We have been shown a video footage wherein Silent Killer was acknowledging to Mr Fred Matenga that he had been given the US$500 initial deposit as per their agreement, which he was flagging on camera. Your client in the same video footage confirmed the material terms of their agreement as outlined above as regards the agreed payment terms.We are instructed by our clients that notwithstanding the above, upon arrival at RG Mugabe Airport on 18 April 2025, your client, after our clients agent had checked him in; subsequently refused to disembark the car and board the initial 3pm flight that had been booked for him. He was left by the plane after he refused to come out of the car at RG Mugabe Airport.It is alleged that upon arrival at the airport your client had started making a fresh demand of a US$300 payment which he alleged he wanted to leave with his girlfriend or wife. Notwithstanding the fact that this demand was outside their agreed terms and contract, client sent the US300 to one Diva who was with Silent Killer and had been the middle men between the parties. But still he refused to disembark the car, board the plane and was left by the plane knowing fully well how his actions were further prejudicing our clients and the grave consequences that would ensue. The US$300 was however subsequently sent back to our client after Silent Killer failed to board the plane.It is further alleged that your client asked our clients to book him another flight after giving them the impression that he was remorseful for his conduct and was desirous to honor his contractual obligations. Clients proceeded to book yours another ticket for a 6pm flight on the same day.Client alleges that even after buying a second air ticket, Silent Killer made a new further demand for another payment outside their agreed contract terms. It is alleged he first made an unreasonable and startling demand for the money which he said was due to his DJ, who was never a party to the contract and was not travelling with him to the UK. Upon realising that this demand was opposed and could not be entertained, it is alleged that Silent Killer then started arguing that clients should not have booked him a 6pm flight but a Saturday morning 1am flight instead.It is further alleged that Silent Killer then started claiming that he would never board the 6pm plane because he had had a dream whereby the plane had exploded. Clients further allege that instead of going to check in so as to board the 6pm flight, Silent Killer was invited and chose to go and eat food at a restaurant within the RG Mugabe Airport and once again failed to check in and was left by the second plane on 18 April 2025, reads the letter.As a result of silent killers failure to perform, the organisers said they had to find a last-minute replacement artist, Oriyano, leading to additional expenses and a diminished audience turnout.As a result of your clients failure to board the plane to the United Kingdom, our clients had to make an alternative, unplanned arrangement to rope in Oriyano to come on board as he was in the United Kingdom at the material time. Clients had to pay Oriyano for his performance.Clients show had a lesser attendance due to Silent Killers none attendance. Silent Killers fans chose to not attend the event in protest and client lost potential revenue.Further to that, it is alleged that your client went on to make several misleading, damaging allegations against our clients in his podcast interview; which allegations have caused our clients serious reputational damage. Their good names and brand has been dealt a fatal blow as a result of the alleged disinformation by your client.For the record, your client had been given more than the US$500 which he was supposed to have been given before he boarded the plane to the United Kingdom as per the performance agreement with contract. Your client had received and withdrew in advance a total of US$1,500 before he even left Zimbabwe, reads the letter.Y2K Entertainment has instructed silent killer to pay the full amount of US$122,170 for the damages he made, and to be paid within seven days, failing which they will pursue legal action.It is against this background that clients have instructed us to write this letter of demand.
