            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nMashonaland West Provincial Affairs Minister and Zanu PF legislator Marian Chombo has been spared jail after the High Court struck down a contempt of court application against her.\n\nJustice Joel Mambara struck down the bid by Cubs Den Consolidated (Pvt) Ltd, which sought to have Chombo,the former wife of ex-Finance Minister Ignatius Chombo,together with businessman Tawoneyi Nyazema and Stephen Mutamba jailed for allegedly defying a court order to vacate leased commercial premises.\n\nThe judge ruled the application fatally defective, finding that the provisional order central to the dispute was never personally served on the respondents.\n\nOur courts have long insisted on strict compliance with the personal-service requirement in contempt proceedings, Justice Mambara said. Failure to serve an order affecting liberty personally renders the proceedings defective.\n\nThe court further noted that the Deputy Sheriff had not attempted to enforce the August 22 provisional order authorising eviction, meaning there was no evidence that Chombo and her co-respondents wilfully defied the court.\n\nIn fact, the applicants admit that no service took place, the judge said. Without proof of a breached obligation, no contempt can be found.\n\nThe urgent chamber application, filed by MD Hungwe Attorneys, was therefore struck off the roll with costs.\n\nChombo, who is also a Member of Parliament, was represented by Advocate Zikiti and T. Serengwa of the Civil Division.\n\nThe case stemmed from a dispute over commercial premises leased by Cubs Den Consolidated, which accused Chombo, Nyazema, and Mutamba of unlawfully occupying and interfering with its operations. Although the court issued a provisional order in August barring the trio from the property, the failure to serve and enforce that order ultimately undermined the contempt case.\n\nThe ruling comes as a relief for Chombo, who had faced the possibility of imprisonment if found guilty.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Supreme Court has granted Fernicary Farm (T/A Rutendo Farm) a lifeline in its bitter multimillion-dollar dispute with Des Monies Farm (Pvt) Ltd, reinstating an appeal against a High Court order that awarded US$455,000 in compensation for farm improvements.\n\nJustice George Chiweshe, sitting in chambers, ruled that although Rutendo Farm had failed to meet procedural timelines, its case carried reasonable prospects of success, allowing the appeal to proceed.\n\nAlthough the delay in complying with the infringed rule is not inordinate, the explanation for such delay is not plausible. However, I am of the view that the intended appeal has reasonable prospects of success. It is for that reason that the application must succeed, Chiweshe said.\n\nThe case dates back to 2019, when Rutendo Farm leased its property to Des Monies Farm for a term of eight years, expiring in 2027. The lease collapsed amid disputes, leading to a Deed of Settlement in which the tenant agreed to vacate but would be compensated for improvements, including road repairs, fencing, water reticulation, irrigation maintenance and refurbishment of the main house.\n\nWhen compensation was not paid, Des Monies Farm sued, and in 2022 the High Courts Commercial Division ordered Rutendo Farm to pay US$455,000, dismissing claims it had not consented to the improvements. The court said the landlord had been kept informed and never objected.\n\nRutendo Farm appealed, arguing the improvements were never properly approved, no valuation report was produced, and some of the claimed amounts such as US$150,000 for bush clearance, were operational costs, not improvements. However, it missed deadlines in serving its notice of appeal, causing the case to be deemed abandoned until this latest ruling.\n\nThe High Court award of US$455,000, convertible to local currency at the interbank rate, remains in dispute. If Rutendo Farm succeeds on appeal, Des Monies Farm could lose its compensation for the contested farm developments.\n\nThe Supreme Courts ruling means the appeal will now be heard on its merits, setting the stage for a decisive judgment in this commercial farming dispute.\n\n",
