            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nEXILED former Information minister Jonathan Moyo himself once an architect of draconian media laws has conceded that the latest legislation requiring motorists to pay a Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) licence fee before acquiring road authority and insurance fees was not in sync with technological advancements.\n\nThis is despite the illegality of the entire law, which is based on its discriminatory nature.\n\nMoyo, who fled Zimbabwe in 2017 at the height of the military coup that removed former President Robert Mugabe from power and subsequently saw President Emmerson Mnangagwa rise to leadership two weeks later after being dismissed as Vice President by Mugabe, launched a scathing attack on Mnangagwa.\n\nSince the Broadcasting Services Act (BSA) Amendment Bill was signed into law earlier this week, Zimbabweans have expressed widespread dissatisfaction with the new legislation, particularly clause 15, which mandates that motorists must pay the ZBC licence fee  without which they cannot purchase their ZINARA vehicle licence and insurance.\n\nMoyo, who had grown cautious about openly attacking Mnangagwa on platforms like X and in interviews with regional and international news organisations over the past two years, has now waded back into the debate around the ZBC licence fee for motorists.\n\nBasically, the revolution in digital technologies has outdated car radio licences, which is why they have been vacated worldwide, Moyo wrote on X on Friday.\n\nHe added that Mnangagwas government still has an opportunity to repeal the new law, as it is outdated and has been overtaken by technological progress.\n\nIn this connection, the Second Republic had, and still has, an opportunity to repeal the 2001 car radio fee as an outdated, no longer necessary, inconvenient, now unreasonable, and unfair tax burden, Moyo said.\n\nHe further commented: The challenge for a broadcasting licence fee nowadays is how to structure it, perhaps as a tax, taking into account the rapid and massive technological and social transformation taking place.\n\nMoyo implored Mnangagwa to hit the brakes on implementing the controversial law, arguing it must be revised through a digital lens.\n\nIt would be in both the public and national interest to pause the implementation of the car radio licence in order not only to rethink it; but to also review the very idea of a radio and television licence in a digital world; with a view to coming up with a more suitable and modernised, user-friendly, alternative model of a single and comprehensive broadcasting licence fee model, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "By James Muonwa\n\nA ZIMBABWE Republic Police (ZRP) officer stationed at Ruwa allegedly beat up a suspect to death in a bid to instil fear and force him to pay a bribe for his freedom.\n\nAs a result, 39-year-old Constable Prince Ndavambi (Force Number 078641D) is now at the centre of controversy following the death of Blessed Believe Juruvenge (30) of 14316 Damafalls, Phase 1, Ruwa, situated on the outskirts of Harare.\n\nJuruvenges body still lies at Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals mortuary awaiting another postmortem after relatives disputed the doctored results of the first one.\n\nAccording to a police internal memorandum gleaned by NewZimbabwe.com, the now deceased owned a tuck-shop at his place of residence in Ruwa. Sometime in April 2025, he got a job to operate as a pirate taxi driver and left his wife, Mercy Madenyika in charge of the store.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, around 1000 hours, Madenyikawas approached by a neighbor and five other unidentified male adults, who bought some groceries worth US$$10using a fake US$$50 note and were given some change before fleeing from the scene.\n\nMadenyika later discovered that she had been duped and alerted her husband, the now deceased, about the matter.\n\nJuruvenge then approached some of the people among the group which had bought groceries at his tuck-shop using fake money.\n\nAn altercation arose and the now deceased, assaulted one of the men once on the face using open hands. One of them only identified as Mwazha offered Juruvenge US$100 as compensation for the inconveniences and he accepted it and went away.\n\nMwazha later proceeded to ZRP Ruwa and made a report of assault and theft against the now deceased CR 185/04/25 refers, reads the memo.\n\nOn May 27, 2025, around 1130 hours, the accused person number 078641D Constable Prince Ndavambi and Mwazha proceeded to the now deceaseds place of residence and arrested the now deceased.\n\nThey took him to Ruwa Police Station together with his sister Melisa Manyepa of Damafalls, Phase 1 whom they accused of harbouring the now deceased, the memo further reads.\n\nOn arrival at the police station, Ndavambi detained the now deceased under DB 460/25 and force-marched his sister to the back of the cabin and assaulted her on the knees using a wooden stick.\n\nThe accused person later took the now deceased from cells to the cabin where he assaulted him all over the body using a wooden stick. He ordered the now deceased and his sister to refund Mwazha his US$100.\n\nThe accused person threatened to kill the now deceased if he fails to refund the money. He also demanded another US$100 from the now deceased and his sister so that he can release them, police said in the memo.\n\nThe constable only stopped flogging Juruvenge after noticing he had become unconscious.\n\nUnperturbed, Ndavambi is said to have ordered Manyepa to contact her relatives to bring the money. She contacted her mother Elipa Jimu and others, who could not raise the required money.\n\nAccording to the police internal communication, the rogue cop then instructed a battered Juruvenge to stand up from where he was lying so that he shunts him into cells, but victim could not move. The police officer them pulled now deceased into the cell.\n\nAssailant later released victims sister to go and find money and she proceeded home. That evening, the accused called Manyepa asking her to bring food for the now deceased and she indicated that that she could not walk due to her knee injury as a result of the earlier beating.\n\nOn the same date at around 2130 hours, a cell check was conducted by the duty member, and he observed that the now deceased had difficulties in talking and breathing.\n\nAn entry was endorsed in the Occurrence Book entry number 3917/25. Officer in Charge ZRP Ruwa was advised through telephone and instructed the duty member to take the now deceased to hospital under police guard.\n\nThe now deceased was taken to Ruwa Rehabilitation Centre for medical attention where he was admitted.\n\nOn 28 May 2025 around 0615 hours, the now deceased passed away at Ruwa Rehabilitation Centre, reads the memorandum.\n\nThe informant reported the matter at ZRP Ruwa.

Investigations are in progress, the memo says.\n\nThe investigations are being done under ZRP Ruwa CR 379/5/25.\n\nAccording to the now deceaseds brother, Robson Juruvenge his family is devastated by the murder, which they feel someone is trying to cover up.\n\nAfter we contested the unconvincing results of the first postmortem results, we have been told another postmortem will be done on Monday.\n\nWe have been in talks with police Commissioner Mbiri of PGHQ (Police General Headquarters). Also, we have been summoned to Ruwa Police Station this Saturday, Robson told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nHe vowed the family will leave no stone unturned in a bid to unravel the truth surrounding his brothers gruesome killing at the hands of a rogue law enforcement officer.\n\n",

This was after his company, TN Asset Management, underwrote a rights issue for the company late last year.\n\nResponding on his X (formerly Twitter) recently, Nyambirai clarified that while he cannot speak on behalf of Steward Bank or EcoCash Holdings, he vowed to push for an official disclosure via the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE).\n\nA legal notice on the change of name of Steward Bank Limited has generated a lot of interest here on X.\n\nWe shall seek the authority of the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange to publish an update on the name changes. The update shall seek to answer some of the questions that have been raised, he said.\n\nA name looked at in the abstract might be meaningless. But the way the owner carries the name gives it value. Many Zimbabwean bank names lack obvious meanings, yet their strength lies in how they deliver on their promises.\n\nThe present generation would have demanded that Henry Wells and William Fargo change names first, before they named their banks, Wells Fargo after themselves, he said.\n\nThe rebranding process, he noted, will follow stringent corporate governance procedures, including shareholder consultations.\n\nMarket watchers believe that Nyambirais challenge remains convincing the public that the new identity will uphold or surpass the banks legacy.\n\n",
