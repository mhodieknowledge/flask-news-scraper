            "content": "Reuters\n\nZimbabwe is on track to achieve a forecasted 6% economic growth in 2025 helped by good agricultural output and strong commodity prices, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube said on Thursday.\n\nThe Southern African countrys economy has shown signs of recovery in the first half of the year following a severe drought and currency turbulence in 2024 that pushedGDP growth down to 2%.\n\nGiven the positive economic developments during the period January to June, we are confident that the projected economic growth of 6% alluded to in the 2025 National Budget is achievable, Ncube told parliament in a mid-year budget review.\n\nAll sectors of the economy are expected to record positive growth in 2025, mainly on account of a favourable agriculture season, improved electricity generation, stable exchange rate and inflation rate, he said.\n\nHe did not give an update on the budget deficit, which was seen at 0.4% of gross domestic product in 2025 during the budget forecast last November.\n\nZimbabwes fiscal position remains under strain from grain imports, drought relief spending and the public sector wage bill. While the government has collected more revenue than in the same period last year, analysts say containing the deficit may prove difficult without new fiscal measures.\n\nThe local currency, the ZiG, launched in April 2024 to replace the Zimbabwe dollar, has largely remained stable against the U.S. dollar but is still overshadowed by widespread use of the dollar in everyday transactions.\n\nNcube reiterated the governments commitment to the gold-backed unit and said the currency had benefited from tight monetary and fiscal policies.\n\n",

Ms Pierce toldMIT Technology Reviewher family thought its like something from a sci-fi movie.\n\nIt is believed to be longest that an embryo has been frozen before resulting in a successful live birth. The previous record-holder wasa pair of twins who were born in 2022 from embryos frozen in 1992.\n\nThe Pierces had tried to have a child for seven years before they decided to adopt the embryo Linda Archerd, 62, made with her then-husband in 1994 through IVF.\n\nAt the time, Ms Archerd initially created four embryos. One become her now-30-year-old daughter, and the other three were left in storage.\n\nDespite separating from her husband, she did not want to get rid of the embryos, donate them for research or give them to another family anonymously.\n\nShe said it was important that she was involved with the baby, as they would be related to her adult daughter.\n\nMs Archerd paid thousands of dollars a year for storage until she found a Christian embryo adoption agency, Nightlight Christian Adoptions, which runs a programme known as Snowflakes. Many of these agencies consider their programmes to be saving lives.\n\nThe programme used by Ms Archerd allows donors to choose a couple, meaning they can state religious, racial and nationality preferences.\n\nMs Archerds preference was for a married Caucasian, Christian couple living in the US, as she didnt want to go out of the country, she told MIT Technology Review.\n\nShe ultimately matched with the Pierces.\n\nThe IVF clinic in Tennessee at which the couple underwent the procedure, Rejoice Fertility, said its aim was to transfer any embryo it received, no matter the age or conditions.\n\nMs Pierce said she and her husband did not set out to break any records, but just wanted to have a baby.\n\nMs Archerd told MIT Technology Review she had not met the baby in person yet, but could already see a resemblance with her daughter.\n\n",
