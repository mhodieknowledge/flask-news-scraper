Even that communicationwe are still waiting for it to come formally. Nothing as yet. Hence, we are still in the trenches. The strike is indefinite, AUT spokesperson Obvious Vengeyi told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nLecturers are demanding that their salaries be pegged at US$2,250, which they argue is on par with other higher education institutions in the region.\n\nThey are also bemoaning incapacitation, which has forced them to use personal resources to conduct lessons.\n\nIn a show of defiance, the lecturers have withdrawn from attending meetings, invigilating and marking examinations.\n\nIn an earlier statement, the lecturers said they had been frustrated by the slow pace of the government and UZ in addressing their plight.\n\nDespite prolonged engagement over 18 months, the employer and the minister have failed to meet AUTs demands or make any reasonable alternative offer, resulting in the issuance of a Certificate of No Settlement.\n\nThe dispute remains unresolved, and lecturers and their families are languishing in extreme poverty, with a net monthly salary of less than US$250 and ZiG 6,000a sum from which the employer harshly and unfairly expects employees to subsidise it by providing personal property as tools of work, including laptops, smartphones, data, and transport to and from work, read the letter.\n\n",

            "content": "By Daniel Itai | Connecting Africa\n\nIn recent years Zimbabwe has been implementing more agritech solutions and climate-smart technologies to counter challenges impacting the agricultural sector.\n\nIn November 2021, Zimbabwe launched theNational AgriTech Strategy 2021-2025aimed at digitalizing the farming ecosystem and improving evidence-based decision making for African farmers.\n\nAccording to Farmonaut, a satellite-based crop health monitoring startup, solar-powered irrigation systems haveboosted crop yields by 30%in Zimbabwe.\n\nWithin the last decade, the Southern African country has experienced four drought seasons resulting in erratic crop outputs and the death of livestock, making the adoption of smart agriculture solutions a necessity.\n\nAlthough the government has made calls for the adoption of smart agriculture, access to it and the know-how is still limited to a few farmers who are mainly into commercial farming due to the high cost of acquiring equipment such as drones, solar panels and lithium batteries.\n\nOver the past two decades, the country has been battered with constant power cuts, which have inadvertently led to irregular water supplies affecting communal and commercial farmers.\n\nIn 2020 the government also launched the Intwasa/Pfumvudza program, a climate-smart agriculture model designed to help smallholder farmers improve crop productivity under adverse weather conditions. As a result, the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development has been training farmers to use and implement drone technology in farming, which enables precision agriculture, feed surveillance, field mapping and chemigation.\n\nIn 2023, the government gave the green light to the use of climate-smart seeds such as maize, sorghum, millets, rice, soyabeans, sunflowers and cotton, which adapt to changing climatic conditions.\n\nSpeaking to Connecting Africa, Blessing Phiri, co-founder of agritech company Agriacres, said Zimbabwe has been shifting to renewable energy, solar boreholes, off-grid storage and precision farming.\n\nTo date, several farmers are now using mobile apps, USSD platforms, drones and satellite imaging whilst others have started implementing the central node system or IoT [Internet of Things] sensors and already some have started to yield results especially those engaging in outsourcing precision services, Phiri said.\n\nIn addition, Olga Nhari founder and national coordinator of Women in Agriculture Union (WAU), said the adoption of smart agriculture in Zimbabwe was a significant milestone, especially for female farmers.\n\nWomen farmers are increasingly using mobile apps, precision farming tools, and climate-smart agriculture technologies to enhance their productivity and decision-making. These tools help them monitor crop health, optimize water usage, and predict weather patterns, ultimately improving their yields and livelihoods, Nhari said.\n\nNhari further highlighted that agritech was playing a pivotal role in helping women farmers adapt to climate-related challenges through the aid of weather forecasting systems, soil moisture sensors, and crop monitoring platforms.\n\nSince Zimbabwe got its independence in 1980, there have been variouscontestationson whether Zimbabwe has ever truly been the breadbasket of Africa, a title thegovernment wants to reclaim.\n\nUntil 2001, Zimbabwe had been assigned the responsibility of crop production, food, agriculture and natural resources within the Southern African Development Community (SADC).\n\nIn 2022, the country recorded its highest output of maize, the countrys staple food, securing2.28 million tonsof maize.\n\nZimbabwe requires 2.2 million tons of maize annually, with 1.8 million tons for human consumption and 400,000 tons for livestock feed. This year, the country is targeting an output of 2.7 million tons of maize.\n\nNational Council of Chiefs President Chief Mtshane Khumalo told the Herald Online that communities that planted early this year under the Intwasa/Pfumvudza programare expecting a bumper harvest.\n\nThe Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development is targeting aUS$3.4 billionlivestock sector by end of 2025. It aims to double the national herd, which currently stands at 5.7 million, to 11 million by 2030 through the development of drought-tolerant livestock breeds courtesy of climate-smart breeding strategies.\n\nIn an interview with Connecting Africa, Wendy Zvakawapano, co-founder of Wenashe Farms  a regenerative and climate-smart agribusiness  said Zimbabwes agricultural sector is increasingly embracing technology-driven solutions to improve productivity, adapt to climate change, and work around challenges like power cuts and erratic rainfall.\n\nOur hydroponics units allow us to produce up to three to four times more yield per square meter than traditional soil farming, using 90% less water. In addition, integrating biogas systems has cut our energy costs, not only for our farming operations, but for our employees as well, Zvakawapano said.\n\nOverall, technology adoption has not only increased output, but also reduced input costs, minimized post-harvest losses, and improved climate resilience, especially among forward-thinking agripreneurs and cooperatives.\n\nClive Munakandafa, vice-chairperson of Zimbabwe Commercial Farmers Union for Matabeleland North, said given the countrys increasing exposure to extreme weather patterns, technology plays a crucial role in sustaining the agricultural sectors productivity.\n\nUsing these smartphone applications, sensors, drones, smart irrigation techniques and equipment, farmers are then able to plan their water application schedules based on weather forecasts and adapt as required by the prevailing situations, Munakandafa told Connecting Africa.\n\nAll these advancements have been designed to revolutionize the sector and ensure better yields and harvests under the ever-changing climatic conditions.\n\n",

What I saw was deeply movinga clear indication that many of our people are facing serious challenges. The growing public outcry over our healthcare system is not an exaggeration; it reflects the difficult experiences of many citizens, Machakaire posted on his social media pages.\n\nHowever, critics of Mnangagwas government and the Zanu PF party were far from sympathetic.\n\nFormer Mt Pleasant Member of Parliament and renowned lawyer Fadzayi Mahere had harsh words for the cabinet minister, arguing that Mnangagwas entire government should admit failure and resign en masse.\n\nSo, when we will be raising alarm about the dilapidated state of the public health system, do you think we will be lying? Are you only concerned now because it has affected you directly? Do you ever raise these issues with Minister Mombeshora in your cabinet meetings? Do you finally accept that Zanu Patriotic Front has destroyed the public health system?, commented Mahere.\n\nWith respect, anyone who pretends not to have known about the crisis in the public health sector all along arikunyepedzera kuzungaira. Ministers and senior Govt officials know but they dont care.\n\nThey wont act unless they can directly cash in on the crisis with apic.twitter.com/4UkjFUVjhD\n\n Fadzayi Mahere (@advocatemahere)May 5, 2025\n\nMahere added: Would you concede that Mnangagwa has failed to deliver on his promise of quality healthcare for all? You have nobody else but yourselves to blame since you have been in power for 45 years. Mauraya nyika. What a mess! All of you must resign.\n\nHuman rights and democracy activist Freeman Chari also gave Machakaire a piece of his mind, labelling Mnangagwas government officials morons who have invested in propaganda tactics rather than fixing the problems in the health sector.\n\nThese people are morons. For years we have been saying hospitals are deathtraps, and Nick Mangwana would send a cameraman to take a picture of a single bed somewhere and claim things are well. A few weeks ago Pinjisi died begging for Pain Eeze and they posted a shelf with ARVs in Gwanda claiming all is well. People have been arrested for saying this, Chari wrote on his X account on Monday.\n\nThese pple are morons.

A few weeks ago Pinjisi died begging for Pain Eeze & they posted a shelf with ARVs inpic.twitter.com/KCqdjAlUhk\n\n Freeman (@freemanchari)May 5, 2025\n\nHe added: Next, some moron will post potholes in Victoria Falls and say baba Munangagwa road yashata Yet we have been talking about this for ten years and being castigated for it. This is why I say, when the time comes show no mercy! This whole situation felt like a case of closing the stable door after the horse has bolted.\n\nOne X user, MaZwangendaba, said that every time ordinary citizens raise concerns about poor public health services, they are often laughed at and scoffed at by Zanu Patriotic Front and some government officials, as if they are barking up the wrong tree.\n\nKana tichitaura tinonzi tirimadununu and labelled puppets of the west. They tell us its because of sanctions we asked for. I am glad you have seen what we will be talking about. Open the eyes of your comrades, she said.\n\nFormer Cabinet Minister Walter Mzembi, who himself may not be entirely off the hook considering his past role as a government official, echoed this sentiment. He said Machakaires acknowledgement of the dire situation in Zimbabwes public hospitals could be the first step towards tackling the long-standing health problems.\n\nA rare official acknowledgement of the dire situation in our Health Sector, this kind of public honesty is what solves our challenges, he wrote on his X account Monday.\n\nA rare official acknowledgement of the dire situation in our Health Sector , this kind of public  honesty is what solves our challenges@edmnangagwahttps://t.co/qVvj8Nyufc\n\n Dr Walter Mzembi (@waltermzembi)May 5, 2025\n\nFormer Local Government Minister Saviour Kasukuwere, who is also in self-imposed exile, said Machakaire had shown courage and bravery, qualities needed to tackle national problems.\n\nWe commend Minister Machakaire for his bold honesty and compassion. His recent statement highlights what many Zimbabweans already know: our public healthcare system is in crisis, and urgent action is needed. This is not just about politics. Its about people. About dignity. About saving lives, she said.\n\nSome even warned Machakaire that he might be skating on thin ice, potentially facing dismissal from the government for speaking the truth.\n\nI pray and hope you dont get fired for telling the truth about the disaster that is in our hospitals. Its so pathetic that our government has been focusing on things that should not be prioritised and leaving our Healthcare to decay, said one X user who identified as African Academia.\n\nIt appears Mnangagwas government is on an admission of failure overdrive after George Charambas recent admission that University of Zimbabwe lecturers on strike have a genuine grievance, pledging to take the matter up.\n\nThis comes after Machakaires urgent call for Mnangagwa to look into the collapsing health sector, suggesting a potential shift in how the government is handling public concerns.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/can-edtech-transform-a-nation-facing-infrastructure-challenges/",
            "content": "By Dr Richard Dune\n\nAs Zimbabwe marked 45 years of independence on 18 April 2025, the spotlight (as it usually does) turned to politics, economics, and governance. Rightly so. Yet, in this pivotal moment of reflection, we must also ask: What role can education technology (EdTech) play in reshaping the nations future? And more crucially, is Zimbabwe ready for a digital learning revolution?\n\nThese are the questions I address at theZimbabwe @45panel discussion hosted by Professor Winston Mano at the University of Westminster, where Oxford scholar Professor Miles Tendi launched his latest book, The Overthrow of Robert Mugabe. As the discussion navigates Zimbabwes political past and present, I hope to contribute a forward-looking perspective on digital transformation rooted in realism but not devoid of hope.\n\nWith over 60% of Zimbabwes population under the age of 25, we are looking at a digital-first generation. From WhatsApp university groups to YouTube tutorials, Zimbabwean youth already use mobile platforms for informal learning. Whats missing is structured access, consistent, affordable, and tailored to local needs.\n\nEdTech, when done right, can close the gap between potential and opportunity. Mobile-first, low-data platforms are redefining education access in underserved communities across Africa. Zimbabwe has the talent. Whats needed is the infrastructure to scale.\n\nLets be clear: Zimbabwe cannot leap into a digital learning utopia without overcoming two stubborn obstacles: connectivity and electricity.\n\nZimbabwes mobile data is among the most expensive on the continent. A basic online course or a virtual classroom can become financially inaccessible to the average family. Add to that regular power outages, and you have a digital dream constantly interrupted by harsh realities.\n\nAI and advanced computing, now central to EdTech innovation, require stable electricity, reliable broadband, and costly processing power. These are not yet widely available across Zimbabwe. While global discussions rave about Chatgpt and virtual learning environments, much of rural Zimbabwe is still waiting for a stable 3g signal and a working socket.\n\nThis doesnt mean Zimbabwe must wait for perfect infrastructure to embrace EdTech, quite the opposite. Innovation must reflect reality.\n\nOffline-first learning tools, distributed via SD cards or preloaded on devices, can bridge the gap. Solar-powered ICT centres in schools and communities can bypass the national grid altogether. Data-lite mobile learning apps, integrated with SMS and USSD technology, can deliver meaningful learning without the need for broadband.\n\nThis is what frugal innovation looks like: low-cost, high-impact solutions designed for resource-constrained settings. Its not about building the next Silicon Valley in Harare, but about making sure a rural child in Gokwe can access learning on a cloudy day without waiting for the electricity to return.\n\nThe Zimbabwean diaspora is uniquely positioned to bridge the innovation divide. At LearnPac Systems, our work in workforce development and digital learning spans the UK, Africa, Europe, and Asia. Weve seen firsthand how diaspora-led initiatives can pilot scalable models that bring technology and training together, without waiting for government intervention.\n\nWhether its mentorship, funding, or co-creating with local innovators, the diaspora must move from remittances to strategic reinvestment in knowledge systems.\n\nTo unlock EdTechs full potential, we need a national digital education strategy, not just piecemeal projects. This means:\n\nAt 45, Zimbabwe is neither old nor young as a nation. But like any mid-life milestone, its an opportunity to re-evaluate what truly matters.\n\nIf education is the engine of development, then EdTech could take us further, faster. But we must choose the right fuel, matched to the terrain were driving through.\n\nThe question is not whether Zimbabwe can embrace EdTech. The question is whether we are prepared to design EdTech that fits Zimbabwe, not just copy and paste models from the West.\n\nIn the end, its not about tablets in classrooms or flashy AI tools. Its about giving every Zimbabwean, regardless of location or income, the opportunity to learn, grow, and thrive in a connected world.\n\nThats a future worth building.\n\nDr Richard Dune is the CEO of LearnPac Systems, a leading UK provider of edtech and compliance software solutions for regulated sectors.
