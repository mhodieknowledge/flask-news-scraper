            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA Harare magistrate has denied bail to ten elderly citizens accused of attempting to take part in a protest allegedly organised by fugitive war veteran Blessed Geza.\n\nThe group, aged between 48 and 75, is accused of mobilising for an unsanctioned demonstration dubbed the One Million Men March against President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nMagistrate Caroline Kuhudzayi ruled that the accused were likely to regroup with others still at large and reoffend if released. She also found them to be flight risks given the gravity of the allegations.\n\nThe ten, Rose Chirenje (65), Nyarai Chigudu (52), Kenesia Jera (62), Edward Mandikutse (69), Dexter Jena (69), Hazvinei Machingura (69), Stephen Chagwiza (48), Jacob Masaraure (75), Mapengo Mapengo (57) and Joephrey Chigwerewe (70) were charged with participating in a gathering with intent to promote public violence, breaches of peace or bigotry under Section 37(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act [Chapter 9:23].\n\nProsecutors allege that on October 17, the accused, acting on Gezas social media calls, gathered near Africa Unity Square in Harare, intending to join the protest against Mnangagwas government.\n\nAccording to police, the group was intercepted at the corner of George Silundika Avenue and Sam Nujoma Street while singing and dancing to a protest song with the lyrics, Zvigananda chera mwena nguva yakwana, chera mwena zvigananda, meaning Economic saboteurs, your time is up.\n\nDetectives from CID Law and Order said six suspects were arrested at the scene, while four others Chagwiza, Masaraure, Mapengo and Chigwerewe were later found hiding in a silver Toyota Probox parked at Corner Sixth Street and Kwame Nkrumah Avenue.\n\nInvestigators claim they recovered stones, boulders, and other missiles hidden near the protest site.\n\nIn opposing bail, Detective Sergeant Lovemore Chisi said releasing the accused could endanger public order.\n\nThe nature of the offence suggests a propensity for inciting or engaging in further public disorder, he said. Releasing the accused could reignite unrest or embolden others.\n\nChisi also warned that the accused might abscond from trial, given the lengthy custodial sentence they face if convicted, an argument upheld by the magistrate.\n\nPolice said investigations were ongoing and that several other suspects linked to the planned march remain at large.\n\n",

They attacked a security guard and the businessmans son before shooting him.\n\nSo far, police have arrested three suspects: Given Mandizadza (34), Phillip Mutasa (38), and Vengesai Jabulani Mutasa, while four other accomplices remain at large.\n\nVengesai Jabulani Mutasa\n\nVengesai initially shot Detective Constable Ngwenya of CID Homicide, who was part of a team trying to apprehend him for Mutangaduras murder, before fleeing arrest.\n\nHe later went to the police station on Sunday, where he found Constable Courage Muchechesi taking a statement from Abraham Mavayo, who was reporting an assault case.\n\nPolice said Vengesai confronted officers at the station, accusing homicide detectives of stealing US$1,000 from his home and demanding to see them.\n\nHe allegedly forced Constable Muchechesi and Mavayo to lie down while demanding money before shooting Muchechesi in the stomach.\n\nMuchechesi staggered out of the building, calling for help, and collapsed near the single quarters where he was later found dead by fellow officers.\n\nHe fled the station and was later arrested by residents from Sanyati, Kadoma, Chakari, and Patchway who had joined forces to track him down.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe African Regional Organisation of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC-Africa), which represents over 18 million workers across the continent, has strongly rejected ZANU PFs plans to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas term.\n\nThe ruling ZANU-PF party recently endorsed a proposal to delay the 2028 general elections, extending Mnangagwas term by two years to 2030. The resolution, adopted at the partys annual conference in Mutare, directed the ruling partys Legal Affairs Secretary to begin drafting the necessary constitutional amendments.\n\nMnangagwa is currently serving his second and final term, as is mandated by the constitution. While he has previously described himself as a constitutionalist, adding he will step down in 2028, he has done nothing to oppose his loyalists, who are pushing for him to hang onto power.\n\nIn a statement of solidarity with the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), ITUC-Africa Secretary General Joel Odigie said African workers have consistently upheld democracy and constitutionalism as the foundation of peace, justice, and shared prosperity.\n\nITUC-Africa Secretary General JoelOdigie\n\nWe join ZCTU in urging African citizens, civil society, and the labour movement to remain vigilant and steadfast in defending the integrity of their constitutions, said Odigie.\n\nSocieties that work are those governed by the rule of law, not the law of force. When constitutions are trampled, democracy dies and with it, the hopes of workers for decent work, social justice, and equitable development.\n\nOdigie called on African Union member states, regional economic communities, and global partners to reaffirm their commitment to constitutional rule and accountable democratic governance as essential pillars of Africas transformation agenda.\n\nThe continental labour leader also rejected military involvement in civil governance and condemned civilian coups, where leaders manipulate constitutions to unlawfully extend their stay in power.\n\nHe further criticised attempts to silence opposition voices, manipulate electoral systems, or stage sham elections designed to entrench authoritarian rule, saying such actions erode hard-won democratic gains.\n\nWe commend leaders across Africa who have resisted the temptation to alter term limits or manipulate constitutions for personal gain. These are true statespersons, guardians of constitutional democracy worthy of respect by future generations, Odigie said.\n\nHe added that leaders who dismantle constitutional order and weaken democratic institutions for the sake of political survival corrode governance, polarise societies, and expose their nations to instability, insecurity, and economic decline.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has struck off a claim by retired Duly Holdings Limited administrator, Theresa Ruredzo, who was demanding a Ford Everest vehicle as part of her terminal benefits, ruling that the matter belongs in the Labour Court, not the High Court.\n\nJustice Munangati-Manongwa upheld a special plea filed by the vehicle dealer, agreeing that Ruredzos case, though framed as a contractual dispute, was fundamentally rooted in her former employment and thus a labour matter.\n\nIt is evident that the plaintiffs claim, despite its contractual framing, fundamentally relates to the employment relationship and the associated terminal benefits, ruled the judge.\n\nHence, the Labour Court possesses exclusive jurisdiction to resolve such disputes.\n\nRuredzo, who worked for 31 years and two months at Duly Holdings, rising from clerk typist to national administration manager, retired in November 2017. She told the court that the company failed to pay her full terminal benefits and later agreed to compensate her with a Ford Everest to be delivered within five years  a promise she said was never fulfilled.\n\nHer lawyer argued that the case was purely contractual since the agreement to deliver the vehicle was made after her retirement, and therefore outside the Labour Courts reach. He cited previous judgments suggesting that post-employment contracts do not qualify as labour disputes.\n\nBut Duly Holdings countered that Ruredzos demand amounted to a claim for unpaid terminal benefits, squarely falling under labour law. The company argued that the 2013 Constitution and subsequent amendments to the Labour Act gave the Labour Court exclusive jurisdiction over such employment-related claims.\n\nThe plaintiff has brought her claim before the wrong court, the defence argued, relying on a string of Supreme Court decisions affirming that even cleverly framed contractual claims cannot escape the Labour Courts authority.\n\nJustice Priscilla Munangati-Manongwa agreed, noting that while Ruredzo tried to repackage her claim as a private contract, the car in question was undeniably part of her terminal benefits.\n\nThe agreement for the delivery of the Ford Everest motor vehicle is intrinsically linked to the employment relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant, the judge said. This brings the claim squarely within the jurisdiction of the Labour Court.\n\nThe court upheld Duly Holdings special plea and ordered Ruredzo to pay costs.\n\nRuredzos long-running fight for her promised Ford Everest is now likely to continue before the Labour Court, the only forum legally empowered to decide whether Duly Holdings must finally deliver the vehicle.\n\n",
