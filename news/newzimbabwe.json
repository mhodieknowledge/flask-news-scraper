The Bank finalised a US$15 million Agrobond which was privately placed with a European Fund and will go towards supporting the agriculture sector, she said.\n\nDuring the period under review, the Group generated operating income of ZWG1.3 billion for the nine months to September 30, 2025.\n\nIn terms of the Groups core business, net interest income rose by 63% compared to the same period in 2024, driven by increased loans and advances to productive sectors and support for consumer needs. Core income streams remain resilient, supported by strong growth in loans and deposits, while management continues to prioritise revenue diversification and cost optimisation.\n\nThe Group incurred operating expenditure of ZWG1.1 billion, a 70% increase from the prior year. This variance primarily reflects the impact of strategic business reengineering initiatives undertaken during the year, including restructuring and staff rationalisation to align operations with the Groups strategic vision.\n\nTotal assets increased to ZWG9.2 billion, up 27% from ZWG7.3 billion recorded on December 31, 2024. The growth was anchored by an expansion in loans and advances, which stood at ZWG4.2 billion at the end of the quarter.\n\nThe domestic economy is projected to grow by 6.6% in 2025 in line with earlier projections in light of the sustained macroeconomic stability, record-high gold prices, growing remittances and a 12.8% rebound in agriculture following the 2024 El Nino.\n\nIn light of the above, the Group will continue to focus on supporting key sectors of the economy through its core business, Mutandwa added.\n\n",

The hosts, under recently appointed manager Romanian Marian Marinica, who replaced Michael Nees a few weeks ago, fell behind when Mohamed Gouda scored on just nine minutes.\n\nHowever, Munashe Garananga equalised midway through the first half, with Belgian Pro League club Mechelen winger Bill Antonio grabbing a winner on 74 minutes to seal a long-awaited triumph. Writing on Instagram, then looking ahead to the Africa Cup of Nations which sees Zimbabwe take on Angola, Egypt and South Africa in Group B, the competition starting on December 21, with the first game against Egypt on Saturday, December 22, Nakamba believes the victory was a huge momentum going into the tournament.\n\nHe said: A BIG THANK YOU to all Zimbabweans who were rallying behind us back from home, all over the world and those in Qatar, Saudi Arabia who came out in numbers to support us during the international friendly matches. Without you, we feel incomplete. Thank you to the ZIFA leadership, led by the Zifa president Nqobile Magwizi for organising such kind of international friendlies matches. Thank you to the Minister of Tourism, Honourable Barbara Rwodzi, who took time to visit the team in camp and to watch us play against Algeria in Saudi Arabia on Thursday, even though we disappointingly lost that match 3-1.\n\nLastly, I want to thank the corporate world and all football stakeholders, we dearly need your support in everything we do, kindly chip in, help and support us. The victory against Qatar brings confidence and renewed zeal within the squad, especially with just a few weeks left before the prestigious AFCON tournament. As players, we always play with our hearts out, I believe with your support and if we all pull in one direction, we will get it right. This is the moment we need your support the most. Thank you, Zimbabweans.\n\n",

Among them is HC 2312/24  Collin Zondai Makoni vs The State, which the writer says came [before] Justice Munangati despite the fact that it was from her law firm, involving lawyers Skumbuzo Mpofu and Skyvaine Vongai Tendere. This matter is pending decision pronouncement, the letter notes.\n\nThe whistle-blower also cites Thelma Chimbanga vs L Gono Enterprises (HC 1518/24), which they say was heard by the same judge despite originating from the same law firm, and is still awaiting a set down.\n\nAnother flagged case is Blue Star Logistics vs Harare Motorways (HC 8108/24), where Thabani Mpofu is representing the Applicant, with the author adding: I believe this anomaly is being overlooked since Thabani Mpofu and Webster Chiikwanha are the best of friends.\n\nThe author insists that Justice Munangati Manongwa should not hear any matters instructed to Advocate Mpofu by Munangati and Associates legal practitioners, urging ZACC to intervene because these allegations, which are very serious in nature be investigated so as to avoid prejudice to other litigants.\n\nThe writer further notes that this is not their first complaint to ZACC: Kindly note that I once wrote to your good office again on the 24th of June 2024.\n\n",

Stability for beyond one year is crucial for the market to accept a mono-currency arrangement,  he said.\n\nThe Reserve Bank attributes the increase to several factors, including:\n\nGold reserves currently stand at around 3.5 tonnes, and the authorities say the country has benefited from the global gold price rally.\n\nZimbabwe also continues to accumulate reserves through the foreign-currency surrender system, in which exporters convert part of their earnings into local currency.\n\nAt the rate we are accumulating these reserves, it is quite encouraging. Our exports are increasing, and this is what funds reserve accumulation.\n\nHowever, they cautioned that beyond building reserves, confidence in the ZiG and broader economic performance will determine the success of the 2030 single-currency target.\n\nOur economy has been performing to expectations, and in some cases exceeding expectations, despite external shocks. But stability remains the foundation for trust in the currency, Gwanyanya said.\n\n",

            "content": "WHO\n\nZimbabwe is intensifying efforts to improve the prevention, early detection and treatment of breast and cervical cancers by integrating cancer and chronic disease services into primary health care. This approach aims to bring essential health services closer to communities and ensure women have equitable access to quality care.\n\nCervical cancer accounts for almost 41% of all cancers among women in the country, followed by breast cancer at 13%, according to Zimbabwes National Cancer Registry. To address the burden, the Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC), with support from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and partners, is implementing measures to strengthen integrated cancer services across the health system.\n\nIn July 2025, WHO handed over medical equipment worth US$20,000 to the MoHCC to support service delivery at the primary health level. The specialised equipment can be used to screen for noncommunicable diseases, including diabetes and hypertension.\n\nBuilding on this support, the MoHCC and WHO held training-of-trainers sessions in August 2025 for health professionals from Mashonaland West and Matabeleland South provinces.\n\nMany cancers are preventable. Let us spread the word and let all women know about it, says Esther Ngaru, one of the trainees and reproductive health officers at MOHCC.\n\nTwenty-five health professionals were trained on integrating the management of breast and cervical cancers, mental health and chronic diseases, as well as coordinated provision of prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment and care services.\n\nThe trainers are disseminating this knowledge to frontline health workers to strengthen prevention, screening, and treatment at the community level.\n\nThanks to this training, our screening will be more effective than ever, says Audrey Musorowembudzi, a nurse at Hurungwe Rural Health Centre. At my facility, I will share this knowledge with my colleagues so that no woman is left behind.\n\nIn Karoi, a town in Mashonaland West Province, seven primary health care nurses and village health workers have already benefited from these trainings.\n\nVillage health worker Angeline Mukusa from Chigumbura Village says she will use the lessons learned to raise awareness in her community. Cancer is a major concern where I live, she says. I will encourage early detection and HPV vaccination for girls. Cancer is treatable if detected early and this will save many lives.\n\nAccording to the districts medical officer Dr Munyaradzi Chidaushe this approach is already improving service delivery. This work is transformative. Village health workers can identify and refer women suspected of breast or cervical cancer more easily. Prevention is key to protecting communities, he says.\n\nThese activities are part of the Womens Integrated Care for Cancer Services (WICS) project, led by the WHO Regional Office for Africa with support from Roche. Implemented in Cte dIvoire, Kenya and Zimbabwe, the project aims to strengthen integrated breast and cervical cancer services within primary health care. Zimbabwe was selected because its established cervical cancer programme provides a foundation for integrating additional services for cancer and chronic diseases.\n\nThrough the commitment of health workers, the leadership of MOHCC, and the support of WHO and partners, Zimbabwe is taking a decisive step towards reducing the burden of breast and cervical cancer, says Dr Desta Tiruneh WHO Representative in Zimbabwe. These efforts bring the country closer to a future where no woman dies from a preventable or treatable cancer and where health systems truly serve communities with equity and compassion.\n\n",
