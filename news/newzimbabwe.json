            "content": "By Tariro Mugadza\n\nIts been just over a week since I attended Zimfest, having had my first experience of the festival in 2007 when I was in a pushchair under a year old, and Im already ready to grab tickets for the next one. Alongside the overwhelming joy and warmth this years event left me with, Ive also been carrying a deep sense that I experienced something truly meaningful, something far beyond just having fun. It stirred something within me, strengthening my connection to my roots and heritage. After all, its not every day that I get to be among my people, especially beyond the familiar walls of my home.\n\nThis was my second time inviting non-Zimbabwean friends to Zimfest, and it gifted me with an even deeper appreciation for my culture and heritage. Witnessing their genuine curiosity, enthusiasm, and respect for Zimbabwean culture was profoundly moving. Seeing them light up with joy and admiration for the very things I grew up loving is something I will never forget.\n\nWhether they were drooling over the culinary delights, like chakalaka and boerewors (shoutout to Just James MCR for that delicious lunch!), or captivated by the visual brilliance of Zimbabweans showing up and showing out in style, the day was filled with heart-warming moments and an overwhelming sense of pride.\n\nReflecting on their experience at this years Zimfest, my friends shared some powerful sentiments. Anton, who is UK-born and half-British, half-German, said, Im not even from Zimbabwe, and it made me feel more connected to its culture.Fikunmi, who is Black, Yoruba, and migrated from Nigeria to the UK at the age of three, said, Going to Zimfest allowed me to connect to a culture that wasnt my own, yet I still felt welcomed, like an honorary Zimbabwean.\n\nMy lunch bought from the Just James MCR Stall at Zimfest\n\nFinding a Sense of Identity and Belonging\n\nLiving in the Diaspora, I know firsthand that it is simply not possible to constantly return home or physically engage with your people. This is where festivals like Zimfest step in by providingthe much-needed opportunity to be amongst your people, to fully embrace and express your native identity and to rejoice in a common sense of cultural pride.\n\nHere in the diaspora, the culture I was raised withfrom the daily home-cooked meals to the dcor adorning our walls, from the music blasting during ourgochi gochiand braais in the back garden to the spirited family games of Crazy Eightsdoes not reflect the culture I encounter the moment I step outside my front door.\n\nBack home, stepping out and being surrounded by your own people is part of everyday life. But here, in the diaspora, those moments are rareand therefore deeply precious. This is especially true for those of us who grew up or lived in predominantly white areas, in places weve never truly identified with and perhaps never will. In spaces where, for years and sometimes even now, simply seeing another Black person in town becomes a moment of excitement.\n\nTinaye, a second-generation Zimbabwean migrant who was raised in South Africa and moved to the UK for boarding school at the age of 12, attended Zimfest for the first time this year. She commented: Zimfest is a reminder of how much community you can find in the UK being a Zimbabwean andI find that important as someone who has gone to predominantly white schools.\n\nFor, as a second-generation migrant, I am one with those whom I simply do not have immediate access to. Yet, at Zimfest, there is that precious opportunity to truly feel that strong, unwavering power of unity and Ubuntu as I join with my community.\n\nRuvarashe, a second-generation Zimbabwean migrant born and raised in the UK, commented on Zimfest as a powerful way to connect with my roots. Exploring the distinction between first-generation and second-generation migrants, she stated: While first-generation migrants carry lived memories of home, I often navigate identity through culture, music and community. Zimfest helps bridge that gap by providing a space dedicated to belonging, pride and a deeper understanding of my heritage. Alongside the inherent sense of belonging that comes along with attending Zimfest, there is the more personal, individual aspects of being able to walk around comfortably knowing that I will not stand out or receive looks of fear or judgement simply on the basis of skin colour alone.\n\nTinaye further stated: Its quite easy to feel isolated and feel like youre out of place and losing your culture.But, when youre surrounded by people and hearing your language even though you are not in your country, you realise that you are not alone. Zimfest is empowering in that, I know that guaranteed for at least one day of the year, I will be able to evade the everyday sense of minority to exist within the majority on the Zimfest grounds  just like kumusha.\n\nCommenting on her experience as an African migrant living in the Diaspora, my friend Fikunmi further stated: It was hard fitting into British culture and often I felt alone, but being at Zimfest helped me know that I am not alone, and even with people outside of my own culture I have a family.\n\nLooking Back and Looking Forward\n\nThe establishment and organisation of such a significant and meaningful celebration of culture and identity is far from a lacklustre trick which can be pulled together overnight but rather a process of resilience, dedication, determination and reflection.\n\nStuck in a mesmerising haze of Zimfest nostalgia, I became curious to find out more about how and why Zimfest has become such a noteworthy event on both a personal level, for me as a second-generation Zimbabwean migrant living in the Diaspora, and on a community level for the thousands of people I join with each year. This led me to ask a representative from the Zimfest organising team to reflect on the main motivations for Zimfest, the vision for Zimfest itself and the vision for the generations to come:\n\nAlthough gone are the days of seeing Mtukudzi (MHSRIEP)  the first high-profile musician to play at Zimfest  and Mukanya onstage, there are so many magnificent ways Zimfest has continued to improve over the years since its humble beginnings as a come together without the focus on music that we appreciate nowadays. This includes the innovation of the festival to include the younger generation by adding features such as the Fun Fair and the Amapiano tent. Tinaye further commented: Its great to see so many young Zimbabweans, South Africans and Africans embracing their culture and keeping up with the mainstream artistry of Zimbabwe even though we do not live there.\n\nPersonally, I loved how the layout of Zimfest improved this year, with the Fun Fair area becoming more central. Despite being too old for the trampolines, it was a delight to discover that I still qualified to ride the Ferris wheel. What a superb way to soak in the views at Zimfest! I personally cannot wait to try out the swing ride that made its first appearance this year, next year!\n\nA view of the Zimfest crowds from the ferris wheel\n\nThe Zimfest organisers representative commenting on Zimfests plans to become even bigger and fresher said: To enhance Zimfest, the plan includes featuring diverse, internationally acclaimed artists and introducing new activities like dance sessions and cultural exhibitions for various age groups. A hybrid experience with virtual attendance will attract a global audience. By gathering continuous attendee feedback, Zimfest aims to innovate and remain relevant, ultimately creating an inclusive celebration that fosters unity and pride in cultural heritage.\n\nI have always felt included at Zimfest and appreciated it as a family festival. However, this year, there were some community concerns raised about Zimfest remaining as family friendly and inclusive as previous years. With respect to these concerns, the Zimfest organising team representative expressed: Zimfest aims to create a family-friendly atmosphere by enhancing its appeal for all ages. Key initiatives include:\n\nCommunity Business Ethics\n\nIt is thanks to Black Zimbabwean-owned businesses such as Nyama Butchery (now closed) in Birmingham and Mwanaka Fresh Farm Foods in Walsall and local businesses such as Palmers in Milton Keynes and Joseph Morris Butchers that I have grown up with the gap between life in the Diaspora and lifekumushamore bridged. Growing up, stepping through the PVC strip curtains of the Nyama butchery  donned the maputi shop by either me or my sister and eventually the whole household  felt like arriving at Narnia itself. It is here that I developed my lifelong love for lemon creams and Mazoes cream soda. In August 2023, I was blessed to be invited to celebrate the renowned Mwanaka Fresh Farm Foods 20+ years of farming in Cambridge. The day was deeply emotional and inspiring to see such great success and be told such poignant stories within my very own community.\n\nFrom the small stores selling wonders breaming with Zimbabwean pride, such as gorgeous jewellery (shoutout to Rungano from Paper Pieces for the beautiful, sustainable jewellery I bought last year), stylish Zimbabwean apparel and mouth-watering snacks, to the major sponsors, such as World Remit and Diaspora Insurance, the message is clear: it is fundamental that we as Black Africans, support Black owned and African owned businesses. The money spent here has so much more significance and promotes far more ethical business practices than a quick order from the likes of Shein and Temu. For example, in the UK, it is a reality that the Black British community has a spending power of 300 billion, yet only 2% of this is spent within Black-owned businesses. By supporting Black owned and African-owned businesses, you contribute to alleviating existing economic disparities and breaking down systemic barriers that bog down Black enterprises.\n\nJewellery at Paper Pieces 2024 Zimfest Stall\n\nCommenting on the economic significance of Zimfest and wider community impacts, Jeff Madzingo, the CEO and Founder ofDiaspora Insurance, stated that Zimfest is a very significant event in more than one way. Beyond the socio-cultural importance, it glues a thriving community celebrating identity and togetherness. He further stated We, Diaspora Insurance, always plug in as a sponsor to make it worthwhile and economically viable to the organisers because Zimfest as a whole is not just an opportunity to empower each other, but a little economy where our black spending power is leveraged to prop up small community businesses that serve us as a people. By supporting the businesses of our people, we also invest in the economies of our home countries. When devouring delicious plates of food at Zimfest that leave you wanting to lick your fingers, it is not only the body that is being gloriously fed, but our businesses, our economies and our people.\n\nWhile Zimfest is very much about being together and interacting as a people, we must not forget the tangible, physical grounds and natural environment of Zimfest that allow us to partake in our festivities side by side. As well as maintaining respect for each other as attendees, we must also respect the venue and the natural grounds upon which we have been united and brought together as a community. After Zimfest, there were eyesores of waste littering the once green Herts Country Showground and a dismal afterparty of litter picking and waste removal had begun.\n\nA View of the Rubbish leftover at The Herts County Showground after Zimfest\n\nIn response to my queries on what Zimfest could implement and introduce to reduce waste and become more sustainable, the representative from the Zimfest organising team commented: Partnering with environmental organisations boosts recycling through more bins and community education on waste disposal. Collaborating with vendors to reduce single-use plastics and use biodegradable materials supports sustainability. Hosting workshops provides practical tips, fostering lasting environmental awareness. This strategy minimises waste and enhances community engagement for a greener future. As for the hideous congregations of waste dumped and abandoned by attendees at the venue after the event, the Zimfest representative stated: Efficient post-event waste management is essential for sustainability. Key strategies include:\n\nCollaborating with local waste management services for effective processing.\n\nHeres to a more green, clean and sustainable Zimfest!\n\nThe music, artistry and dancing\n\nZimfest is a place where people of all ages can dance as one.\n\nWithin a behind-the-scenes video displayed to the audience at a school fundraiser before my performance, I explained, Dancing in general [it was a tap performance] has always been such a passion of mine and a large part of that is credited to my heritage as a Shona person. Zimfest wholeheartedly made me feel the power of this acknowledgement. Through dancing and music, I immediately feel connected to my heritage, culture and history. This is why, as a second-generation Zimbabwean migrant living in the Diaspora, I am grateful to be able to attend festivals like Zimfest where you can fully embrace and enjoy the collective melodies, basslines, sways and shuffles that pulse through your body and tenderly deliver you home. Whether in the queue for food, walking across the grass to the main action or in the middle of the Amapiano tent, we were jiving and vibing. We were truly here. After leaving early morning and driving hours on the motorway to get to Zimfest, the sight of the Amapiano tent in the distance as we increasingly approached the Herts County Showground not only raised the energy in the car but also reenergised my sleepy self in the left backseat. Unaware of how the days events would unfold, I began to feel prepared and excited  a true testimony to the power of Zimfest.\n\nThe Amapiano tent at Zimfest 25\n\nOne special, cherished thing about the celebration and rejoice that occurs at Zimfest is that we rejoice in our mother languages. Living in the Diaspora, my mother tongue, Shona, is a language that often goes unheard as you pass by strangers on the street, get taught in the classrooms or converse with peers. Yet, at Zimfest, Shona is far from scarce. Reflecting on her experience in the Amapiano tent and in front of the main stage, Tinaye stated, People being able to pronounce the lyrics stood out to me the most. Hearing the crowd singing what sounds correct was quite shocking. The opportunity to hear your language being spoken, sung and chanted en masse is an undeniably soul-soothing experience that I never take for granted.\n\nDespite not understanding the lyrics of the songs, I have watched my non-Zimbabwean friends turn into absolute fanatics of Zimbabwean music and Amapiano. From some never even hearing of Amapiano before, humorously mistaking it for me saying Im a piano to jumping in a manner almost as spirited as Jah Signal in the Amapiano tent, it was pure bliss to see them fully embrace the Zimbabwean rhythms and festivities. Seeing their excitement to see Winky D grace the Zimfest stage as headliner once again was a wonderful way to end our time at Zimfest. Winky Ds stage presence is undoubtedly barrier-breaking not just beyond language but for the physical distance fromkumusha. Despite the headliner no longer onstage and the Zimfest crowds already dispersing, it wasnt yet our time to go. At least, not before taking some group pictures at this years newly added Zimfest sign adorned with the colours of the Zimbabwean flag. What a way to close off such a monumental day of unity, pride, radiance and transcendence!\n\nThe newly added Zimfest Sign on the Herts Country Showground\n\nWhile this years Zimfest lineup certainly did not cease to enthral and entertain, there are still ways to improve, especially with regard to inclusivity and diversity. In response to my inquiry about the diversification of Zimfest to, for example, include more languages and a more diverse lineup with more women, the representative from the Zimfest organising team replied: Incorporating other African languages into Zimfest would enhance inclusivity, celebrate diverse cultures, attract a wider audience, and foster cultural exchange. Zimfest focuses on enhancing diversity by including more languages and a varied lineup, actively seeking female artists from diverse African backgrounds. Future plans involve partnering with cultural ambassadors and community leaders to highlight unique contributions from different African communities.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese are the reasons why I, as a second-generation migrant living in the Diaspora, have always felt Zimfest is the day of summer, if not the year, that I always look forward to. From the small joys of finding out I wasnt too old for the ferris wheel to the big joys of watching my non-Zimbabwean friends indulge in Sadza for the first time and later repeatedly scream at the top of their lungs in unison with the Zimfest crowds Noooooo in response to Winky D asking Can I go home?, Zimfest is a true refresher for the soul and spirit. We must come to festivals such as Zimfest to celebrate, support and rejoice as a people with Ubuntu ablaze.\n\nI simply cannot stop scrolling through the new memories captured in my camera roll. The return home after Zimfest has not just been physical  equipped with new, beautiful jewellery to adorn at my next outing and a cheeky packet of lemon creams my mum surprised me with this week  but emotional, spiritual and transcendental. The warmth of Zimfest takes me back to my few but meaningful moments kumusha such as sitting across the blazing fire and bonding with my loved ones to watchingvana sekuru nanambuyajive while Zim classics such as Mukanyas Chimurenga music ring out. The event began with rain leading us to take cover in the Amapiano tent  with our dance moves making it all less miserable  and, as the festivities progressed and picked up, it was not just the daylight that got brighter and clearer.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Supreme Court has dismissed an appeal by a Harare lawyer, Samantha Nhende, challenging a High Court ruling that found she was in a tacit universal partnership with her former partner, Andrew Zigora, effectively upholding the division of their jointly acquired property.\n\nThe ruling reinforces the growing judicial recognition of tacit universal partnerships in Zimbabwe, particularly in relationships governed by customary law but exhibiting economic interdependence and joint contribution akin to civil marriages.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, a tacit universal partnership can arise when a couple cohabitates without a formal marriage, and a court determines they were operating as a partnership based on their conduct.\n\nTo establish this, one must prove: each party contributed something to the partnership (money, labour, or skills), the business was for their joint benefit, and the objective was to make a profit.\n\nIn a recent judgment delivered by Justice Hlekani Mwayera, sitting with Justices Susan Mavangira and George Chiweshe, the court ruled that Nhendes appeal had no merit.\n\nThe court also confirmed the lower courts decision to allocate 55% of the property to Nhende and 45% to Zigora.\n\nThe appeal be and is hereby dismissed with no order as to costs, the Supreme Court ruled.\n\nThe parties entered into an unregistered customary law union on 1 August 2010 and later dissolved it in February 2021.\n\nThroughout the subsistence of the union, both parties were formally employed.\n\nNhende earned US$2,000 monthly as a legal officer, while Zigora was also formally employed by a leading telecommunications company, receiving a gross monthly salary of US$5,000.\n\nPrior to the parties entering into the customary law union, Nhende owned a stand in Manresa Suburb, which was allocated to her by her employer.\n\nZigora also owned a stand in Madokero Suburb.\n\nDuring the union, on 1 November 2015, the parties moved into a flat in Avondale.\n\nThey split financial responsibilities with Zigora responsible for paying rentals of US$550 per month and utilities.\n\nNhende was accountable for food, clothes and maintenance of the house.\n\nWith time, the parties agreed to purchase a property in Mabelreign.\n\nThey mutually secured a mortgage home loan facility through Nhendes bank. The title was thus in Nhendes name.\n\nZigoras stand in Madokero was used as collateral for the mortgage loan.\n\nHe also made deposits into Nhendes bank account, including payments for the home insurance of the property.\n\nZigora also made contributions towards the renovations of the property.\n\nThe parties also incurred and shared medical bills in their efforts to undergo medical procedures to help Nhende conceive.\n\nThe medical issue led to the fallout of the parties, culminating in the dissolution of their customary law union.\n\nZigora approached the court a quo seeking an order for the distribution of the matrimonial property of the parties.\n\nHe argued that the parties unregistered customary law union was a tacit universal partnership in which both parties contributed individually and collectively to the acquisition of the property.\n\nAfter obtaining the mortgage bond, Nhendes salary was centred on the repayments of the loan, whereas he catered for all other expenses, including the renovations of the property, as it had been purchased to be a matrimonial home.\n\nThe parties intended to raise a family on that property.\n\nNhende in the High Court averred that there was no tacit universal partnership between herself and the respondent, because they each managed their finances individually, even though they were staying as husband and wife.\n\nShe argued that the concept of tacit universal partnership does not apply to customary law unions.\n\nThe property in question, located at 2 Glynde Avenue, Mabelreign, was purchased during the parties unregistered customary law union, which lasted from August 2010 to February 2021.\n\nThough the property was registered in Nhendes name and the mortgage was drawn from her salary, the court found that Zigora contributed significantly to the household, renovations, and insurance, and had even offered his own property in Madokero as collateral for the mortgage loan.\n\nThe High Court had ruled that the property was jointly owned through a tacit universal partnershipa finding Nhende contested on appeal.\n\nNhendes legal counsel, Mr. T. Mapuranga, argued that the High Court erred in law by finding a tacit universal partnership without direct evidence of pooled finances or shared ownership intentions. He further contended that the court failed to consider Zigoras Madokero stand as part of the parties combined estate and that improvements made by Zigora should have been addressed under unjust enrichment rather than as contributions justifying ownership.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court disagreed.\n\nJustice Mwayera wrote: Their conduct during the acquisition and development of the property meets the requirements of a tacit universal partnership The parties consistently consulted each other on every intricate detail relating to the acquisition and renovation of the property.\n\nMwayera noted that the doctrine of tacit universal partnership applies where individuals in a close personal relationship contribute jointlyfinancially or otherwisefor their shared benefit, even outside a formal legal marriage.\n\nOn the issue of law application, the court reinforced that when customary law is inadequate to resolve a property dispute equitably, general law principles, such as tacit universal partnership and unjust enrichment, may justifiably be invoked.\n\nAddressing the division of the property, the court held that the High Court exercised its discretion judiciously by acknowledging both parties contributions.\n\nRegarding the Madokero property, the Supreme Court concurred with the respondents argument that it was irrelevant to the current dispute as it was not part of the pleadings before the High Court and had been acquired before the union.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has dismissed an application by the late former president Robert Mugabes secret son, who was seeking to be included as a beneficiary in the longtime rulers estate.\n\nThe alleged son, Tonderayi Gabriel Mugabe, was seeking condonation for the late filing of his review against the estate of the late Robert Gabriel Mugabe.\n\nIn his application, he cited Bona Nyemudzai Ouma Mutsahuni, acting in her capacity as the estates executrix and the Master of the High Court.\n\nBut High Court judge Fatima Maxwell dismissed his application, noting among other things that there was no documentation confirming that he is Mugabes son.\n\nThe inclusion of the fathers details on a birth certificate is proof of acknowledgement of paternity.\n\nThe exclusion, therefore, when the birth certificate was obtained during the lifetime of the alleged father is a clear indication that paternity was not acknowledged, said the judge.\n\nThe judge said re-registration of birth is governed by section 19 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act [Chapter 5:02].\n\nHe saidit can only be conducted where the status of a child is to be changed from being born out of wedlock to born in wedlock.\n\nSection 19 does not allow the re-registration of a birth of a child born out of wedlock whose parents never married and whose father is late.\n\nApplicant did not state that his mother ever married the late former President Robert Gabriel Mugabe.\n\nThat may be the reason why, even though the Births and Deaths Registration office might have bowed to the pressure of the name, they did not go as far as to reflect the details of the alleged father on the birth certificate.\n\nApplicant seems not to have understood the request by the Masters Office in Annexure D to obtain a birth certificate confirming his position.\n\nIt is not simply a matter of having a surname, but of having a birth certificate confirming that the alleged father is indeed the father as claimed.\n\nSuch confirmation would have been if the tendered birth certificate had the details of the father of the child.\n\nNone of the documents confirms who the father of the child is.\n\nWhilst it confirms that the applicant is a sibling of the other person tested, it does not show paternity. What it shows is that he might have been sired by one of the males related to the person who was tested.\n\nFor the above reasons, I find that the applicant has not discharged the onus of proving that he was entitled to benefit from the estate of the Late Robert Gabriel Mugabe.\n\nThere is no reason to allow the reopening of Estate Late Robert Gabriel Mugabe DR 2703/19. No basis has been laid to justify reviewing the Masters decision to confirm the account and close the estate, ruled the judge.\n\nMugabe asserted that he was the son of the former President Robert Gabriel Mugabe, having been born in Mozambique in 1977.\n\nHe presented a narrative of secretive family ties and a quest for identity within the Mugabe lineage.\n\nMugabe said he was born on 20 April 1977 in Chimoio, Mozambique to one Hilda Maeka, having been fathered by the late former president.\n\nHe said his parents met in Zimbabwe after independence, and for reasons unknown to him, his father did not want it to be disclosed to the public that he was his son until a later stage.\n\nHis mother died before the disclosure.\n\nMugabe also alleged that he would meet his father occasionally, but that was kept a secret from the first family.\n\nHe was, however, in contact with his fathers siblings, such as Bridget Mugabe, read court papers.\n\nMugabe further alleged that his father passed away before he was formally introduced to the Mugabe family.\n\nThe estate was advertised, and he notified the executor, Bona Mugabe, about his claim and the fact that he was the deceaseds son.\n\nAccording to court documents, Bonas lawyers requested a DNA Test.\n\nThe DNA tests confirmed that he was born of the Mugabe parental lineage.\n\nThrough a Notarial Deed of Change of Name, he changed his name from Tonderayi Maeka to Tonderayi Gabriel Mugabe.\n\nHe then approached Bona and her lawyers, but was not entertained.\n\nOn the 2nd of June 2023, he then learnt that the estate was closed on 18th of December 2020 by confirmation of the account.\n\nMugabe said he attempted to obtain a declaratory order for the reopening of the Estate of Late Gabriel Mugabe under case number HCH 3729/23 but was not successful.\n\nDespite these claims, the High Court also found the application for condonation lacking in merit, primarily due to his failure to provide a satisfactory explanation for the substantial delay of over four years in pursuing his claims.\n\nThe degree of non-compliance is inordinate, and the explanations given are rife with gaps, ruled the judge, emphasising the need for clear and convincing evidence in matters of inheritance.\n\nThe court deliberated on various factors, including the significance of the alleged heirs delay, which was described as inexplicable by the judge.\n\nWhile the applicant claims a right to the estate, he has not established a reasonable basis for the delay in filing his application, Justice Maxwell articulated, reinforcing the gravity of procedural timelines in legal proceedings.\n\nIn dismissing the application, the court cautioned against potential prejudice to the rightful beneficiaries of the Mugabe estate.\n\nThe balance of convenience favours the dismissal of this application as the deserving beneficiaries of the Estate Late Robert Gabriel Mugabe would be greatly prejudiced by the reversal of a process that was completed more than four years ago, said the judge.\n\n",

Most private farmland remains in the hands of the white minority, while most farm workers are black and poorly paid, fuelling resentment among the black population, while many white farmers complain of high crime rates.\n\nWilliam Musora, 50, another farm worker, is the third accused. He and Mr Olivier, 60, are yet to enter a plea and remain behind bars.\n\nThe three men also face charges of attempted murder for shooting at Ms Ndlovus husband, who was with the women at the farm  as well as possession of an unlicensed firearm and obstructing justice for allegedly dumping the bodies in the pig enclosure in an attempt to conceal evidence.\n\nMr Musora, a Zimbabwean national, faces an additional charge under South Africas Immigration Act over his status as an illegal immigrant.\n\nThe Limpopo High Court was packed with supporters and relatives of the victims ahead of proceedings. Also present was Mr Oliviers wife, who was seated in the front row of the public gallery and could be seen wiping away tears.\n\nMembers of opposition party Economic Freedom Fighters, which has previously called for the farm to be shut down, were also present in the courtroom.\n\nThe trial was postponed to next week.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZANU PF Legal Secretary Patrick Chinamasa has said controversial businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei is now a member of the partys Central Committee and the matter is over and irreversible.\n\nTagwireis co-option into the Central Committee has dragged on, with a faction within the ruling party reportedly opposed to his endorsement into the influential organ.\n\nIn a statement posted on socialmedia, Chinamasa said, The Zanupf Department of Legal Affairs is relieved and takes note that the furore/controversy/confusion/wrangle/much ado about nothing/social media hype/misinformation/disinformation that surrounded Harare Provincial Coordinating Committee (PCC) co-option of Cde Kudakwashe Tagwirei into the Zanu PF Central Committee is now over and irreversibly settled.\n\nFrom the outset, it was difficult to understand the source of the problem. Our Harare PCC convened on Monday, 31 March 2025, and voted to recommend the cooption of Cde Tagwirei into the Central Committee.\n\nThe Province addressed the letter of recommendation to the Zanupf Secretary General, Cde Dr. Obert Moses Mpofu. The letter was copied to the Departments of the Commissariat and Legal Affairs, amongst others.\n\nThe confirmation by Chinamsa is in contradiction with the ZANU PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwasremarks earlier this month that Tagwireis bribe would not work in the party.\n\nTagwireis admission into this elite structure is being widely interpreted as part of a long-term strategy to position him for a future presidential bid, setting him on a collision course with other factions, particularly those aligned with Vice President Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nThe ZANU PF benefactor has been viewed as exploiting his proximity to President Emmerson Mnangagwa to push his leadership agenda.\n\nChinamasa acknowledged that the co-option of Tagwirei has been divisive in the ruling party.\n\nSo the controversy surrounding Cde Tagwireis co-option into the Central Committee surprises me and took me completely off guard. Given Cde Tagwireis commitment to Zanupf and his track record in the service of the Party, the somewhat negative publicity and narrative surrounding his co-option into the Central Committee is undeserved.\n\nI have been a member of the Zanupf Central Committee continuously and without break since December 1987, and a member of the Zanupf Politburo since the year 2000 to date, and I can state unequivocally that throughout this long period of nearly 38 years as Central Committee or as Politburo, we have never had to debate, let alone discuss, PCC recommendations of cooptions into the Central Committee. We always treated such recommendations as fait accompli.\n\nThe cooption of Cde Tagwirei is the first ever to be the subject of discussion and social media commentaries. The only explanation why the Tagwirei cooption has attracted such controversy may be because there are people out there who, for reasons best known to themselves, have an axe to grind, said Chinamasa.\n\n",
