            "content": "Medicalbrief\n\nSouth Africa  TheNational Department of Healthhas condemned the action taken by some groups to prevent foreign nationals from accessing essential healthcare services around the country, after campaigners in both Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal blocked clinic and hospital entry to migrant patients, demanding proof of identity before anyone was allowed in.\n\nThis week, members ofOperation Dudulain Gauteng and of theMarch and Marchmovement in KZN began manning the entrances of government facilities that includedAddington HospitalandGateway Clinicin Durban,RK Khan Hospitalin Chatsworth, andHillbrow Clinicas well asRosettenville Clinic,south of Johannesburg, in a bid to prevent alleged undocumented foreigners from seeking health services.\n\nThe Mercuryreports that they accosted patients at the gate and demanded they show ID documents to confirm they were South African nationals.\n\nIn Rosettenville last week, foreign nationals were barred from the local clinic by the protesters who said they were fed up with the long queues that mostly comprised illegal foreign nationals and who, they added, are placing a strain on the facilitys already stretched resources, reportsKaya959.\n\nThey said the clinic was on the brink of collapse, having already stretched its resources to provide free healthcare  mostly to migrants.\n\nClinic management denied allegations that it was turning people away, saying it was attending to everyone walking into the health facility, reportseNCA. Some patients in the queue said they had been waiting for assistance for a week.\n\nPut SA First\n\nDaily Maverickreports that the various anti-migrant groups broadly fall under the Put South Africa First banner  including Operation Dudula, thePatriotic Alliance(PA) and several smaller community groups.\n\nThe groups are demanding that South Africans be prioritised over undocumented migrants  whom they want deported  for economic opportunities and services, like healthcare, accusing them of burdening the countrys health system to the detriment of locals.\n\nThey demanded proof of our nationalities and denied us access because we are not South Africans. The clinic has our clinic cards because we come here for medical attention, said a young mother who was at the Rosettenville Clinic to have her baby vaccinated.\n\nThe Immigration Act stipulates that only immigration officers and members of theSouth African Police Service(SAPS) have the authority to ask citizens and foreign nationals to produce valid documentation.\n\nAt the Hillbrow Community Clinic, where members of the PA, along with a small group of residents and members of Operation Dudula, denied access to foreign nationals, an off-duty security officer toldDaily Maverickthat the (anti-foreigner) groups that have been coming here are not happy with the matron.\n\nThey feel she is siding with the foreign nationals, and when they came on Friday, some demanded to speak to the clinics provincial manager, he said.\n\nAt the Rosettenville Clinic, where community members stood guard at the gates screening patients, Aneliswa Dutshwa, who spoke on behalf of the local anti-migrant group, claimed South African voters concerns were not being taken seriously by the government.\n\nWe want Immigration and Home Affairs to be visible. We are not taking a break until they are both visible, Dutshwa said.\n\nForeign nationals who were barred from entering the facility said they were also being denied a chance to take their clinic cards so they could seek help elsewhere.\n\nSome said they could afford private healthcare, but, pointed out oneZimbabwean who was at the clinic to collect medication, private health facilities require their clinic cards, with their full medical history. Without their cards they could not go anywhere else.\n\nI would have left already because its clear that they will not allow us in, but I want my clinic card because private health facilities require those. If they can give me my card, I will leave, she said.\n\nOperation Dulula\n\nOperation Dudula, which has vowed to intensify its operations at health centres, has been calling for the deportation of all undocumented foreign nationals since its emergence in mid-2020.\n\nThe groups Zandile Dabula said they would escalate their operations and also call for doctors who are foreign nationals to be replaced with South Africans, even if the foreigners were legally employed.\n\nThe government has condemned the groups and said it would deploy police to maintain peace and enforce the law at the affected facilities.\n\nGauteng police spokesperson Brigadier Brenda Muridili said: These deployments are as and when needed, and should the need arise, the SAPS will respond to its mandate.\n\nIllegal\n\nDepartment of Health spokesperson Foster Mohale said the reports were concerning.\n\nWe have noted with concern these illegal actions, he said, adding that no one has the right to prevent anyone from medical treatment.\n\nEveryone who happens to be in the country is protected by a number number of prescripts, including Section 27 of the constitution, theNational Health Act, and theRefugees Actof 1998.\n\nWhile there were claims that those seeking health services are illegal in the country, and while the department condemns the action of those who enter the country illegally, he said, no one has the right to take the law into their own hands.\n\nGauteng Health MEC Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko indicated that her department has begun engaging concerned community-based organisations involved in the campaign, adding that while they noted the concerns by some groups, our Constitution allows everybody to access healthcare services, so it becomes difficult for us to chase people away.\n\nTheSouth African Human Rights Commission(SAHRC) said the rise in complaints from people being turned away from facilities was unlawful, discriminatory, and an infringement on human rights, reportsIOL.\n\nSection 27(1) of the Constitution clearly states that everyone has the right to have access to . services, including reproductive healthcare, it said in a statement.\n\nThe SAHRC has urged health departments and provincial leaders to address critical issues plaguing the sector, like staff shortages, long waiting times, and insufficient bed availability, saying these challenges, compounded by discriminatory practices, exacerbate healthcare inequity in an already strained system.\n\nMeanwhile, theForum for South Africa(FOSA) said the Human Rights Commission is failing in its arguments as it advocates for undocumented migrants to access healthcare services in this country.\n\nThe organisation added that illegal foreign nationals taking advantage of national health services arenot only affecting South Africans, but other legal documented foreign nationals.\n\nThey burden the system while accessing medications earmarked for citizens and documented migrants, said the organisations spokesperson, Tebogo Mashilompane.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nDelta Beverages (Pvt) Ltd has raised concerns over the excessive local sugar pricing and the sugar tax, saying both factors are undermining the companys competitiveness.\n\nAppearing before the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Industry and Commerce on Tuesday, Deltas Finance Director Alex Makamure said the current sugar pricingset at US$900 per metric tonne by Gold Star and US$890 by Tongaat Hulettsis significantly higher than import landed prices.\n\nCurrently, imported sugar is landing at $800/int before adding the 30 surtax. With the added cost of the sugar tax, the impact of the sugar cost is a key determinant of the viability of our business.\n\nThe high cost of sugar is in addition to the recently introduced sugar tax, which is equivalent to another US$100/MT.\n\nAccording to Makamure, prices of sugar-added soft drinks increased by between 15% to 45% following the introduction of the tax in February 2024.\n\nThe highest increases were on cordials such as Mazoe Orange Crush. The process of cordials has been moderated since January 2025 after the surtax was halved to $0.0005/g.\n\nHe said most beverage producers had reported a miscalculated volume performance since February 2024, with most players absorbing the sugar tax by maintaining discounted prices to avoid a volume collapse whilst awaiting the much-needed review of the tax levels by the authorities.\n\nThe duties and surtaxes penalise the manufacturers even when they have no alternative but to access local supplies.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Sugar Association reports that they had in excess of 16,000 tons of carry-over bottler-grade sugar stocks from the 2024 milling season and there will be over 90,000 tons of uncommitted sugar stocks from the 2025 milling season.\n\nMakamure added that the sugar tax further compounds operational challenges, calling for urgent policy reviews to support the local industry.\n\nZimbabwe is a net exporter of sugar and attracts reciprocal tariffs from other countries.\n\nThe main suppliers of refined sugar are StarAfrica (Goldstar Sugars)and Tongaat Hullets (Hippo Valley & Triangle).\n\nAdded Makamure, Over the years, they have failed to meet the quantity and quality requirements.\n\nGiven these challenges, the Industry and Commerce ministry agreed with the bottlers to supplement their requirements from imports.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/lithium-smuggling-rampant-as-zimbabwe-fails-to-end-corruption/",
            "content": "By Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThis story was originally published by theGlobal Press Journal.\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  In 2023, Peter, a truck driver, was approaching a border checkpoint between Zimbabwe and Mozambique. He had little reason to question what was in his trucks sealed container  hed transported shipments for this Chinese-owned company before.\n\nWe just thought everything was in order, he says.\n\nBut rather than chrome, the mineral listed on the containers paperwork, inspectors found raw lithium. By law, unprocessed lithium shouldnt leave Zimbabwe without written permission from the minister of mines and mining development. Peter didnt have that. Border officials impounded the truck and trailer  worth more than US$50,000  for a year. Drape Trucking, the company where Peter works, recovered it after paying a US$5,000 fine.\n\nZimbabwe, which boasts Africas largest lithium reserves, is poised to help meet global demand in the race to secure green energy and develop advanced technology. Its production pales in comparison to powerhouses like Australia and Chile, but the country is still among the top-eight producers of the mineral, producing 1,200 tons in 2021 alone.\n\nBut as demand grows, so does illegal trading. In Zimbabwe, some companies mislabel shipments or underreport the quality and quantity of lithium exports. Border officials  either unaware or complicit  allow the shipments to slip through, undermining efforts to regulate one of Zimbabwes most valuable exports.\n\nPeter asked that Global Press Journal use only his first name, and he did not share the name of the company responsible for the shipping containers contents. He provided the name of the owner of the company, but Global Press Journal was not able to verify the involvement of anyone by that name in the industry.\n\nTendai, a former border agent, says hes accepted bribes to allow lithium shipments to pass through the border. Tendai confirmed the incident involving Peter and says he was arrested and fined for his role. Like many other sources who spoke to Global Press Journal for this article, he asked not to use his full name for fear of losing his job.\n\nIn 2022, Zimbabwe banned the export of raw lithium to curb smuggling and extract more value, since the law would force mining companies to process lithium domestically. Since then, some of the largest lithium mining companies in the country, such as Arcadia and Bikita Minerals, have set up processing operations.\n\nData on whether these regulations have generated more revenue is hard to find. Official records show that the countrys lithium production capacity surged by 230% between 2022 and 2023. Most of the product ends up in China, which controls 90% of Zimbabwes mining sector. Even so, the ban has done little to contain lithium smuggling across Zimbabwes porous borders.\n\nThe regulations are ineffective, says Gorden Moyo, director of the Public Policy and Research Institute of Zimbabwe. Officials, including members of security services, who collude with politicians and foreign governments, particularly China, facilitate illegal exports, he says.\n\nNomsa Jane Moyo, the general manager at the Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe, a parastatal group that inspects exports, says the organization closely monitors mining at all stages to ensure that companies export the quantities and qualities they declare. They intercept those who skirt the law, she says.\n\nThe government seized 22 lithium shipments in 2023 and 23 in 2024. Some were seized before reaching the borders; others were flagged by officials at the Forbes border post, between Zimbabwe and Mozambique, and the Beitbridge border post, between Zimbabwe and South Africa.\n\nA sign marks the entrance to Prospect Lithium Zimbabwes processing plant in Goromonzi. Despite government efforts to curb smuggling, former border officials say companies conceal high-grade lithium and bribe authorities to export unprocessed minerals. Most of the countrys lithium ends up in China and Hong Kong. Credit: Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nAccording to the Minerals Marketing Corporation, in 2023, the country sold a total of 769,086 metric tons of lithium, valued at US$794 million and produced by two main lithium mining companies, Prospect Lithium Zimbabwe and Bikita Minerals. Two-thirds of these minerals went to either China (59%) or Hong Kong (7%), according to United Nations trade data.\n\nBut these figures dont reflect the true volume of lithium leaving Zimbabwe, says Tendai, the former border agent. Lithium export permits are issued with a fixed limit for how much a company can export, so companies often underreport, he says.\n\nIt all starts at the mines, where officials claim to closely monitor activities, says Tatenda, an employee at Prospect Lithium Zimbabwe who asked that Global Press Journal use only his first name for fear of losing his job.\n\nTatenda says the company undervalues high grades of lithium. And while the ministry of mines carries out inspections, he says, the high-quality lithium is concealed beneath lower-value ore to mislead inspectors.\n\nGlobal Press Journal made several attempts to speak to Prospect Lithium Zimbabwe. Officials indicated that they would comment but did not respond to subsequent requests.\n\nNomsa Jane Moyo, from the Minerals Marketing Corporation, says the lithium quality tests theyve carried out at Prospect Lithium Zimbabwe meet all legal requirements.\n\nTendai, the former border agent, says the mining companies sometimes bypass shipment records by bribing not only border officials but also officers from the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority or the Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe and others within the export chain.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Revenue Authority did not respond to multiple requests for an interview, and Nomsa Jane Moyo did not respond to allegations of corruption within the Minerals Marketing Corporation.\n\nCorruption facilitates smuggling, but some border officials dont always know what theyre inspecting, says Levious Chiukira, a customs and trade consultant at Gleam Customs and Clearing Agency.\n\nI worked as a customs official for years, yet I cannot differentiate between petalite and lepidolite, both of which are forms of lithium, he says. [The revenue authority] does not employ geologists, and there is no institutional capacity to address this knowledge gap.\n\nPiles of lithium at a mine in Mutoko. Zimbabwe banned the export of unprocessed lithium in 2022, but weak enforcement and corruption have allowed smuggling to continue. Credit: Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nExporters exploit the regulatory gaps, Gorden Moyo says. While corruption is punishable by law in China, when they operate abroad, they act with impunity.\n\nThe government hasnt helped. Contracts between the state and investors are not accessible to the public, according to a report by the Africa Policy Research Institute. It erodes public trust, says Tafara Chiremba, an environmentalist at the Zimbabwe Environmental Lawyers Association.\n\nBecause of the smuggling, Chiremba says, its China, not Zimbabwe, that benefits from the countrys wealth of lithium.\n\nLinda Mujuruis a Reporter-in-Residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.
