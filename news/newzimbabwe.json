            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nUKRAINIAN political analyst and journalist Peter Zalmayev has suggested that Zimbabwe and neighbouring South Africa present themselves as mediators to end the war between his country and superpower Russia.\n\nZalmayev, who is on a global tour to highlight implications of the war on Ukraine and other smaller countries, was recently in Zimbabwe, having already visited South Africa, eSwatini, Lesotho and some Pacific states.\n\nNamed the Russo-Ukrainian War, the ongoing crisis began in February 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine.\n\nThe war escalated in 2022 when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its smaller neighbouring country, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths and a massive refugee crisis.\n\nSpeaking to this publication in an exclusive interview, Zalmayev said the fact that Russia and Zimbabwe shared a lot of history and that President Emmerson Mnangagwa is assured of an ear in Moscow puts the country in an important position to help end the war.\n\nRussia actively took part in the training, clothing and arming of liberation movements in Zimbabwes fight for independence.\n\nSouth Africa, according to Zalmayev, offers another angle to potential mediation by virtue of being part of the BRICS union. BRICS, an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, is an amalgamation of emerging markets.\n\nIt is these ties which make Zimbabwe and South Africa, which is in BRICS with Russia, very important interlocutors, said Zalmayev.\n\nHarare is on speaking terms with Moscow and my position is that it is best placed to reach out to Ukraine as well and suggest itself as a potential platform for negotiations to end the war.\n\nZimbabwe had been purchasing grain in Ukraine before the war broke out. Zimbabweans are also, in a way, feeling the effects of this war.\n\nIn 2022, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa led a nine-member Africa Union (AU) delegation to Moscow and Kyiv to understand and help mediate. Although they were received by both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraines Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the war continued.\n\nA study by the World Bank, United Nations (UN) and European Union (EU) earlier this year predicted that US$542 billion is needed to reconstruct Ukraine in the next ten years following Russias intensive bombardments in the past three years.\n\nAdded Zalmayev: No one wins in this war. It violates the basic UN principle of sovereignty and infallibility of borders. It is in the interest of smaller countries that Ukraine is allowed to continue existing as an independent state.\n\nIf it falls, it will create a huge precedent wherein bigger countries can walk over and take over the smaller ones.\n\nBefore the escalation of the conflict, Ukraine was one of Zimbabwe and other countries in the regions main sources of wheat and alternative grain imports.\n\n",

Companies are not making profits, they are highly regulated.\n\nThe informal sector has flourished as formal jobs evaporated due to decades of economic mismanagement that led to repeated currency collapses and bouts of hyperinflation.\n\nThe census surveyed 204,798 businesses across a range of sectors, including financial services and construction. The wholesale and retail trade sector accounted for most economic activity, contributing 73%, followed by manufacturing at 8%.\n\nBulawayo province had the highest concentration of formal businesses at 40%, compared with less than 30% in other regions.\n\n",
