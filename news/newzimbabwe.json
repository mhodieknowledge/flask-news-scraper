Instead of notifying the bank or the rightful owner, Mtangandebvu withdrew the money and used it for personal benefit.\n\nIt was further heard that, when the legitimate recipient made a claim, the company discovered the error and reported the matter to the police.\n\nNothing was recovered from the offender.\n\nMtangandebvu was slapped with 36 months imprisonment, of which six months were suspended on condition of good behaviour. A further 15 months were set aside on condition of full restitution to the complainant. The remaining 15 months were suspended on condition that he perform 525 hours of community service.\n\n",

Other projects, such as the Mabvuku Interchange in Harare, are also underway.\n\nSpeaking at a recent media engagement, Goromonzi West legislator Biatah Nyamupinga, who sits on the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Transport and Infrastructure Development, said her committee is committed to advocating for increased allocations to the Transport Ministry as the country prepares for the 2026 National Budget.\n\nAs we approach the budget process, our committee commits to pushing for a reasonable allocation to the Transport Ministry. They need adequate resources to complete the ongoing road projects. The Ministry is doing a commendable job, and we are seeing progress across the country. Lets ensure these roads are completed, she said.\n\nNyamupinga urged the Transport Ministry to openly communicate any challenges it faces so Parliament can channel them to the relevant authorities for redress.\n\nShe also called on contractors to adhere to agreed timelines.\n\nIn some of the areas we have visited, contractors promised to complete their projects by March next year. Lets ensure those targets are met. Delivering on time will strengthen our case when we lobby for bigger allocations. We can then proudly say contractors are delivering the work they were paid for, she added.\n\nDue to high infrastructure demands, the Transport Ministry reportedly exceeded its 2024 national budget allocation by 245% within six months, prompting fresh calls for supplementary funding to sustain projects until year-end.\n\n",

In the eyes of a jittery regime, they are viewed as terrorists who defy oppression, ZINASU said.\n\nThe student union also accused ZANU PF Youth League Political Commissar Taurai Kandishaya of being involved in the conflict.\n\nThe notorious presence of Youth League Political Commissar Taurai Kandishaya, who has a sordid history of doing everything necessary and unnecessary to please his bosses, should not be overlooked.\n\nHe is known for threatening and exposing innocent citizens who dare to think differently from the ZANU PF script. His hand is visible in this case.\n\nAn SRC election should be a democratic process giving young people a glimpse into leadership, yet rogue elements in power continue to use state resources to suppress dissent and manipulate outcomes, ZINASU added.\n\nZINASU said it is demanding the immediate release of Zanga and Saint and vowed to take legal action over the matter.\n\n",

            "content": "The Premier League is the richest and most competitive football league in the world. But the local administration has decided to undergo its biggest transformation in decades. They consider implementing a form of salary cap, known as anchoring. It wont allow clubs to pay new players more than several times the revenue of the lowest-earning club in the league. This financial transformation can potentially reshape the Premier League and the world of football overall. But this is not the only change to be expected in modern football. The busy schedule also required an immediate solution. Read on to learn more about upcoming changes.\n\nAnchoring the Premier League\n\nThe new salary cap will link how much a club can spend on wages to the earnings of the leagues lowest-earning club. The idea is to create financial parity, preventing a few elite clubs from outspending everyone else by huge margins. This transformation promises to have a huge impact on the national league, so every reliableinternet betting serviceis currently assessing potential changes to the betting markets and odds.\n\nThe Premier League has always been a huge financial power in professional sports. Manchester City, Liverpool, and Chelsea are the top clubs, attracting the best players with massive contracts. Yet critics argue that this growing wealth gap has ruined competition, making it hardly possible for smaller clubs to reach the top. Should the anchoring proposal pass or not? It will definitely tie top clubs hands when negotiating salaries. The so-called Big Six clubs have expressed concerns that the new system would limit their ability to attract elite players, potentially damaging the reputation of the national league in the world.\n\nThe financial reform is the main topic for discussion in the Premier League. Meanwhile, other countries are discussing player overload, which is slowly becoming a serious issue. The football calendar has been expanded, with domestic, continental, and international competitions. The Club World Cup now requires teams to play up to seven matches to reach the final. Meanwhile, the Champions League format has expanded to include additional matches on the group stage. The World Cup continues welcoming new teams, increasing the total number of matchups.\n\nThe busy schedule means exciting matches for fans. But it also means more injuries among players. Not everyone can handle the pressure. Cole Palmer from Chelsea played 55 games last season. At the beginning of the new season, the 23-year-old player has already reported a groin injury that would keep him on the bench for weeks. Ousmane Dembl is also struggling with a few muscle injuries this season.\n\nAt the European Football Clubs (EFC) General Assembly, club representatives discussed possible solutions to the existing problem. They considered increasing the substitute allowance from five to six. They also discussed the idea of expanding the team registration limit from 25 to 28 players. The team will be able to rotate players more frequently, which will reduce fatigue and the risk of injury. Not everyone agrees that this could be the right solution to the problem. The Professional Footballers Association (PFA) in the UK has expressed skepticism, arguing that larger teams might not actually reduce mental fatigue. All players must attend training, travel to play matches, and remain mentally engaged throughout the season. If someone ends up without playtime, they still have to be physically and mentally prepared.\n\nOnce thing is clear: if the situation doesnt change, some players may take radical action. In Manchester United, they have already expressed its dissatisfaction with the current situation. They have even explained their failure to qualify for the main European championships with the massive fatigue among players. Will they go on strike? Or will they find other ways of solving the problem? We will know soon!\n\nThe new salary cap and the attempt to survive a busy schedule are two critical issues. The Premier League must decide whether to stay with the current system or move toward fairness and transparency. The anchoring system, if approved, would redefine financial norms in the worlds most expensive league. Increasing substitute allowance and registration limit could also be the first step toward a more reasonable football calendar. After all, player health is more important than commercial gains.\n\nYet, both measures involve a certain risk. Restricted expenses can make football less attractive to global players. Minor adjustments to squad rules may not be enough to protect players from burnout. So far, one thing is clear: change is coming. The decisions made in the coming months will shape the future of football for decades. The Premier League, once the gold standard of wealth and competition, could soon be the testing ground for a new era in world football.\n\n",
