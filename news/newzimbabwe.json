            "content": "By Dr. Richard Dune\n\nFrom Theory To Reality: The Diffusion Of Innovations In Health, Social Care, And Education Sectors\n\nIn 2015, I reached a significant milestone in my career: completing my PhD on evaluating clinical decision support systems in NHS settings. This intellectually stimulating yet exhausting journey deepened my understanding of how new ideas take root or fail in healthcare.\n\nA decade later, my passion for innovation diffusion and adoption remains unwavering. With artificial intelligence (AI), digital transformation, and data-driven insights shaping the landscape, I am revisiting these themes with a renewed purpose: ensuring that innovation isnt just theoretical but actively drives positive change in health and social care.\n\nThis article explores how new ideas and technologies spread within the health, social care, and education sectors, the barriers that slow down adoption, and how we can accelerate impactful change.\n\nThe past decade has seen exponential advancements in AI, machine learning, and digital health solutions. Yet, many of these innovations fail to gain traction in healthcare, social care, and education services.\n\nFor example, clinical decision support systems (CDSS), which were groundbreaking at the time of my research, are still underutilised today despite overwhelming evidence that they reduce errors, improve patient outcomes, and enhance efficiency.\n\nOne of the most effective ways to answer this question is by using the Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) Theory, which explains how new ideas spread within an organisation or industry.\n\nKey factors influencing adoption include:\n\nUnderstanding these factors is critical for entrepreneurs, compliance professionals, and business leaders aiming to introduce new models, systems, or services in regulated sectors like CQC-regulated health and social care services or Ofsted-regulated education services.\n\nReflecting on my research and decades of experience working with NHS Trusts, GP practices, social care providers, and independent healthcare organisations, I have identified three recurring barriers to innovation:\n\nMany healthcare and social care providers operate in fragmented digital ecosystems. Systems often fail to communicate with each other, leading to inefficiencies in data-sharing, compliance, and service delivery.\n\nFor example:\n\nEven the most promising innovations fail to achieve full-scale adoption without seamless digital integration.\n\nTechnology developers often focus on functionality rather than how users in real-world settings will interact with a system. Many healthcare, social care, and education leaders have seen expensive, cutting-edge solutions fail because they did not align with frontline workflows.\n\nFor example:\n\nEnsuring that new systems are tailored to real-world users rather than designed in isolation is crucial.\n\nRegulatory requirements from bodies like CQC, Ofsted, MHRA, and NICE often lead to a risk-averse culture. Organisations hesitate to adopt new approaches because they are uncertain about compliance.\n\nWhile regulatory oversight is essential for safety and quality, it should not hinder technological progress. Organisations need clear guidance on how innovation can align with compliance rather than conflict with it.\n\nThe AI landscape has evolved dramatically since my early research. Today, AI tools like ChatGPT, machine learning analytics, and predictive modelling can revolutionise health and social care.\n\nHowever, AI adoption in regulated sectors must address key challenges:\n\nFor example, AI-powered compliance tools can significantly reduce the regulatory burden on healthcare managers, but they must be transparent, user-friendly, and aligned with existing governance frameworks.\n\nThe good news? Despite these challenges, I have seen extraordinary innovations emerge in health, social care, and education  many from small businesses, start-ups, and compliance leaders.\n\nKey takeaways for business owners, registered managers, and compliance professionals:\n\nBy following these principles, entrepreneurs, compliance specialists, and business leaders can drive impactful change in CQC-regulated health and social care services, Ofsted-regulated education, and beyond.\n\nAt LearnPac Systems, we recognised these challenges early on, which led to the development of ComplyPlus, a regulatory compliance management platform designed for healthcare, social care, and education providers. ComplyPlus also incorporates workforce development solutions, including learning and training management systems, learner assessment and certification, blended learning capabilities and reporting solutions.\n\nComplyPlus is built on the principles of integration, ease of use, and real-time regulatory alignment. It ensures that organisations can simplify compliance, improve governance, and foster innovation.\n\nLets make 2025 a year of bold, transformative health, social care, and education change.\n\nDr Richard Dune is the CEO of LearnPac Systems, a leading UK provider of edtech and compliance software solutions for regulated sectors.

Instead of spending resources on demolition, the government and private partners could invest in refurbishing the structure for public benefit.\n\nPublic-Private Partnerships for Sustainability. This initiative could be jointly managed by the Ministry of Health and Child Care, NGOs, faith-based organisations, and private sector partners specialising in addiction recovery, Masarira noted.\n\nFurther LEAD says the move provides social justice and restorative measures among the public.\n\nMany young people battling drug addiction end up incarcerated rather than rehabilitated. Establishing a dedicated rehabilitation centre would provide treatment, skills training, and support for reintegration into society.\n\nThe opposition party says the initiative aligns with national and global health strategies to combat drugs and substance misuse.\n\nThis initiative would align with Zimbabwes National Drug Master Plan and international best practices that prioritize rehabilitation over punitive measures. I respectfully urge the commission to assess the feasibility of this proposal before proceeding with demolition, Masarira pleaded.\n\n",

It said that the commissioning of various projects during the half-year meant capital expenditure fell to R4bn due to lower levels of growth and replacement capital as projects neared completion.\n\nEarnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation for the half year amounted to R6.5bn.\n\nOur expectation is that the physical market will improve further over time with an improved macro outlook, ongoing supply responses and a more pragmatic auto electrification outlook, Johan Theron, spokesperson for Implats toldBusiness Reportby email recently.\n\nHowever, the near term could remain bumpy for some time.\n\nIn terms of production, Implats output fell 4% to 1.82 million 6E ounces. Impala Rustenburg increased production by 2% to 687 000 stock-adjusted 6E ounces while Impala Bafokeng production amounted to 254 000 6E ounces in concentrate, benefiting from improved efficiencies at Styldrift.\n\nProduction from Marula remained challenged by constrained mining flexibility and organisational restructuring implemented in the period, with 6E concentrate production declining 10% to 101 000 ounces.\n\nThe Zimbabwean unit of Implats, Zimplats, saw its 6E production in matte decrease by 15% to 280 000 ounces. This has been attributed to accumulation of concentrates during the commissioning of the expanded smelter complex at Selous.\n\nAt Impala Canada, 6E concentrate volumes reduced by 20% weaker to 116 000 ounces, reflecting revised operating parameters and lower underground grade for the company.\n\nWhile Two Rivers recorded a 1% increase in 6E in concentrate production to 153 000 ounces, the companys Mimosa JV with Sibanye-Stillwater in Zimbabwe raised 6E in concentrate volumes for the period by 3% to 129 000 ounces, despite challenges presented by power outages that are hobbling producers in the country.\n\nImplats ended the half year period under review with excess inventory of about 375 000 6E ounces although sales volumes quickened 5% to 1.77 million 6E ounces. This was inclusive of saleable production from Impala Canada and Impala Bafokeng.\n\nThe softer US dollar basket pricing was compounded by appreciation in the rand exchange rate and group sales revenue decreased to circa R23 800 per 6E ounce sold, explained the company.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com has invited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal) to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, this week we want to discuss what parents or guardians can do when faced with children on drugs who require rehabilitation. What are the general requirements to qualify for rehabilitation?\n\nVM: Thank you\n\nIt is necessary to start by stating that rehabilitation comes in two forms, voluntary or involuntary. Though voluntary rehabilitation is uncommon because it presupposes that the drug user has accepted he or she has a problem he or she wants to solve, which is normally halfway down the road to recovery, it also makes the process easier for the guardians or family members and the drug user to ensure he is placed in rehabilitation.\n\nThe common position is the drug user will be in denial of the fact that they may need rehabilitation. The drug user, in most instances, does not think that they have a drug problem.\n\nSecondly, the requirements differ for 25-year-old drug users who are legally independent and children below the age of majority.\n\nReporter:You are correct to raise those points, let us start with the qualification for rehabilitation for adults or 25-year-old children.\n\nVM: The test to qualify for rehabilitation as an adult drug offender, is the same test that is used for mental disorder. The drug user must pose a danger to themselves and/ or others or that they have lost complete ability to take care of themselves due to a psychological impairment. This may be exhibited by a complete failure to maintain hygiene, eat or even worse, suicidal thoughts.\n\nThe common thing however is that these drug offenders normally start committing petty crimes, especially in the home. Parents hardly report these because they recognize that their child is under some form of sickness.\n\nThe alternative is that the petty crimes are reported to the police creating a criminal record, this criminal route is available for inebriates who have committed offences as a result of habitual intoxication. The courts may view this history of crimes committed as a result of intoxication and order rehabilitation.\n\nReporter: Should a guardian or family be of the mind that the drug user qualifies for rehabilitation, what can they do?\n\nVM: It is critical to understand that our constitution guarantees every persons freedom and that the freedom should not be arbitrarily taken from them. It follows therefore that the rehabilitation process must be sanctioned by the courts who weigh whether it is just to place the drug user in rehabilitation.\n\nAn order to place a person in forced rehabilitation is issued by a Magistrate who considers, among other alternatives, whether a person should be placed in forced rehabilitation after reviewing medical certification from two practitioners, one of whom must be a psychiatrist or government medical officer.\n\nThe Magistrate also considers whether the medical evidence meets the statutory threshold of mental disorder and imposes measures that are commensurate with the action imposed.\n\nReporter: What if the drug user/addict is causing harm to himself, is there another quicker option to rehabilitation that is not through criminal courts?\n\nVM: Our law permits emergency detention for 72 hours on the basis of a single medical practitioners certification where there is imminent harm to the patient. The medical practitioner will be required to present a report to the Magistrate within 24 hours for the Magistrate to decide whether the detention can be extended via a reception order.\n\nA failure to obtain the authority from the Magistrate within 72 hours renders the detention unlawful and the drug user qualifies for immediate release.\n\nReporter: Does the same apply to child offenders?\n\nVM: With children, guardians must demonstrate that the rehabilitation is necessary, in the best interest of the child and is the least restrictive on the child by giving examples of prior interventions.\n\nThe opinion of the child matters, especially those above 16, their opinions are considered. The starting point is the wariness of the judiciary to separate the child from its environment of love and care. The proposed rehabilitation is not supposed to disturb a stable environment, the educational needs of the childet cetera.\n\nThe main difference between adult forced rehabilitation and that for children is that the guardian or parent plays a critical role in determining whether forced rehabilitation should occur\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have to end here, because of our time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima atvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor atwww.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

The WFP anticipates that about 7.6 million people will need help accessing food between now and May.\n\nWe couldnt harvest anything from our field. Even the melons failed to grow, Bekezela Dube, a 32-year-old mother of four, told United Nations Assistant Secretary-General for Climate, Reena Ghelani, on a visit to the remote rural area of Maphisa.After more than two decades of economic turmoil, many Zimbabweans cant affordimported food. And fatigue has set in among humanitarian donors.\n\nThat leaves multilateral lenders and development finance institutions as the countrys best hope for feeding roughly half its population. Yet unlike other countries including neighboring Zambia, which has already received $1 billionfrom the World Bankand the International Monetary Fund to replenish its food supplies and hydropower-dependent energy system Zimbabwe is locked out of adding to its debt.\n\nZimbabwes creditors include the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank and the Paris Club, all of which have declined to provide emergency funds. The IMF said it is bound by rules that preclude it from making loans to a country already in default to related organizations.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nTHE temporary closure of truck-stop clinics across Zimbabwe, following a recent cessation of USAID funding has raised alarm over a potential surge in HIV cases among high-risk populations, particularly long-distance truck drivers and sex workers.\n\nThese clinics have played a vital role in providing HIV prevention, testing, and treatment services in border towns and high-traffic areas.\n\nHowever, they have been temporarily closed due to the implementation of U.S. President Donald Trumps America First policy.\n\nSpeaking in a parliamentary session Tuesday, Member of Parliament for Hwange West Vusumuzi Moyo urged the Ministry of Health to take immediate action and look for alternative funding sources to ensure vulnerable communities continue to receive the necessary support in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n\nWithout funding for laboratory tests, HIV counselling and antiretroviral medications, many truck drivers and sex workers who rely on these clinics may not have access to crucial HIV-related healthcare services. In turn, this could result in an increase in undiagnosed HIV cases and the lack of consistency of the ART adherence, both of which contribute to higher transmission rates, he said.\n\nWith funding cuts, the sustainability of these services is at risk and the impact could be felt in high HIV prevalence, decreased access to care and return to higher transmission rates.\n\nTo mitigate these effects, it is essential to explore and implore the Ministry of Health to seek alternative funding models and to strengthen our local healthcare system to ensure that the vulnerable population continues to receive the support they need in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n\nMeanwhile, Population Solutions for Health (PSH) New Start Centres have temporarily halted services for patients on ART and those seeking PrEP refills.\n\nApproximately 1.2 million Zimbabweans benefit from the U.S Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and over 1,600 public hospitals and clinics have received training and technical support from the US government.\n\n",
