Despitethislarge workforce, the financial system of HCC is in shambles.\n\nHCC Executive Assistant to the Town Clerk, Mathew Marara, admitted before the Commission,chaired by retired Justice Maphios Cheda, that the workforceis excessively large.\n\nEven 300 is bloated. Yes, the percentage that goes towardssalaries each month exceeds the limits that are prescribedby the government, said Marara.\n\nRELATED:\n\nHCC is plaguedby allegations of bad governance and maladministration failing to carry out its mandate.\n\nThe situation is further exacerbated by City Council officials and Councillors who are influencing recruitment, inflating the wage bill at the Town House.\n\nWhat happens is when you come up with the structures for the organisation, departments recommend the number of personnel and type of personnel they require.\n\nThey recommend these to the human capital department and the human capital department writes reports to the Council to recommenda change in the structure of the organisation. It is the Council which authorises the structure which will be implemented, said Marara.\n\nHCC currently has more than 70 drivers responsible for refuse collection, but most of them are idle due to a shortage of vehicles.\n\nMarara said the only solutionis to reduce the number of workers at the HCC.\n\nCouncil needs to undergo a restructuring exercise but this restructuring can not be undertaken by the current council because on a number of occasions we had recommended reduction in numbers but it has not happened. Definitely, the numbers need to be reduced, he said.\n\n",

Some of the workers spend months at a time underground.\n\nThe lucrative industry is known to be run by Lesotho-based gangs, and police say some of the workers are illegal immigrants recruited from neighboring countries without knowledge of what they have come to do.\n\nTiger was named in statements by miners as a ring leader who ran operations, the police statement said.\n\nHe is also being accused by some illegal miners (as) being allegedly responsible for some deaths, assault and torture that is alleged to have taken place according to videos in police possession. He is also alleged to have hoarded and kept food away from other illegal miners, it said.\n\n",

The governments underfunding of education has emerged as a glaring issue, alongside its lack of seriousness in implementing the new Heritage-Based Curriculum.\n\nTeachers remain untrained for this curriculum, which has not been backed by adequate financial resources or the provision of updated syllabi.

An argument broke out, and he hacked her with an axe.\n\nThe woman had a baby on her back at the time.\n\nThis young mother with her baby on her back was savagely hacked to death with an axe by a man known to the community. Her children saw what had happened.\n\nThe tragedy unfolded when she sought to reclaim her canvas sail, which the assailant had taken to cover his shack, said Mabhena.\n\nMabhena said he was disappointed that police had not arrested the assailant, being known to the community.\n\nThis barbaric act highlights the ongoing vulnerability and systemic injustices faced by migrants in South Africa.\n\nIt is deeply troubling that law enforcement has yet to act decisively.\n\nMabhena said foreign nationals in South Africa, especially those from other African countries, still face many challenges.\n\nMabhena said foreign nationals face challenges, including human rights abuses such as inadequate access to justice and health care.\n\nThe right to life, enshrined in the South African Constitution, is universal and must be upheld for everyone.\n\nYet, migrants often endure violence, neglect, and indifference from the justice system. This incident is not isolated  many crimes against migrants go unaddressed, dehumanising them and fostering a culture of impunity.\n\nMabhena said foreign nationals, especially those from the diaspora,contribute positively to the growth of the economyand have the same goals as South Africans.\n\nWe appeal to all people to reflect on their shared humanity.

            "content": "Business Report\n\nZimbabwean Finance Minister, Mthuli Ncube, is concerned that inward looking policies under newly inaugurated US President Donald Trump could result in higher inflation, elevated interest rates, and a stronger greenback, which could hurt emerging market currencies and capital flight as investors chase treasury bills.\n\nTrump is adopting policies that prioritise the United States interests. He has already signed Executive Orders withdrawing the US from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and limiting foreign aid, among others.\n\nEmerging market finance ministers meeting in Davos for the 2025 World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meetings are concerned that this could have implications for their economies and funding flows for critical sectors such as healthcare.\n\nNcube told a media briefing from Davos on Wednesday that he was concerned that higher interest rates and a stronger US dollar emanating from Trumps inward looking policies will hurt emerging market economies and currencies.\n\nHigher interest rates this will keep the USD stronger and we will not be comfortable if USD is too stronger. A strong USD may encourage imports too much which encourages current account deficits for countries like Zimbabwe, he said.\n\nFor emerging markets, explained Ncube, a stronger US dollar will suck liquidity away and hurt emerging market currencies and capital will exit from these economies in search of treasury bills.\n\nThe United States withdrawal from the WHO will likely result in limited funding flows for healthcare programs under the UN agency.\n\nNcube said Zimbabwe and other emerging markets now have to mobilise resources domestically to plug any funding gaps for healthcare.\n\nZimbabwe has implemented various taxes such as a sugar tax, levies on fast foods and on airtime top-ups in addition to an AIDS levy among others.\n\nResources from these statutory collections, said Ncube, would help the government to marshal domestic resources to fund health sector programs and importation of equipment used in cancer treatment.\n\nWe discussed what Trump means for global trade and international relations especially for Africa. One issue we noted was the US pulling out of the WHO  we felt that this perhaps signals reduced support on health front for countries such as Zimbabwe which relies on PEPFAR funding for HIV programs, said Ncube.\n\nThe withdrawal by US from the WHO means that Zimbabwe has to scale up our funding for health through taxes such as sugar taxes, and fast foods and sin taxes among others to fill the gap in any funding previously received.\n\nZimbabwe has however been battling a shrinking tax and revenue base due to economic difficulties that have resulted in the closure of companies and flight by international investors.\n\nCompanies such as Standard Chartered have recently divested from Zimbabwe while audit and accountancy firms have also been divesting, passing on operations to local management under new brands.\n\n",

Neither firm responded when contacted for comment by BBC Newsbeat.\n\nChris Browns lawyers say he is seeking $500m (405m), after filing the complaint at a court in Los Angeles on Tuesday.\n\nThe statement goes on to say that his lawyers had told producers the allegations  which also included evidence tampering  were misleading and discredited but that Warner Bros proceeded to release the documentary without regard for Mr Brown, prioritising profits over journalistic integrity.\n\nIn a copy of the complaint, seen by BBC Newsbeat, Chris Browns lawyers cast doubt on the dancers reliability as a witness and highlight three claims in the documentary which they say are false.\n\nThese include a comment that he has a predisposition for punching women in the face, the dancers allegation he raped her and a claim he manipulated or deleted texts between them before sharing them with police.\n\nLawyers say the documentary states in every available fashion that he is a serial rapist and sexual abuser.\n\nThe allegations are said to have caused him emotional distress as well as significant harm to [his] reputation, career and business opportunities.\n\nThe documentary has, they say, irreparably tarnished [his] career and standing in the public eye.\n\nChris Brown first faced allegations from the dancer, known in court and in the documentary as Jane Doe, in 2022 when she sued him for $20m (14.9m).\n\nHer lawsuit claimed he drugged and raped her during a party on a yacht at a property owned by Sean Diddy Combs in Miami, Florida.\n\nBut the case was reportedly dismissed by a judge.\n\nThe 35-year-old has had a history of well-documented legal troubles.\n\nIn 2014, hepleaded guilty to punching a man outside a hotelin Washington DC while he was taking a photo with two women.\n\nTwo years later,a model claimed he assaulted her at a Las Vegas casino, however police said there was not enough evidence to bring charges.\n\nA court also ordered him tostay away from ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tranin 2017 after she claimed he threatened to kill her.\n\nLast years documentary also examined other allegations against Chris Brown including a rape inquiry in Paris  in which he was released without charge  and assaulting then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009, which he pleaded guilty to.\n\nHis lawyers say hes never been found at fault for any type of sexual crime.\n\nTheir [Warner Bros and Amples] actions undermine not only Mr Browns decade-long efforts to rebuild his life but also the credibility of true survivors of violence, his lawyer Levi McCathern says.\n\nChris Brown says a portion of any damages would be donated to survivors of sexual violence.\n\n",
