And so therefore, we do need to engage in those types of discussions to see how practical it is and what it finally really means, he said.\n\nAll countries are here, and the United States, the biggest economy in the world, needs to be here, he said.\n\nSo its pleasing to hear that there is a change of approach, and so we are still discussing how that will manifest.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has singled out South Africa for harsh treatment on a number of issues since he returned to the White House in January, notably making debunked claims of white Afrikaners being systematically killed and slaughtered in the country.\n\n",

Captain Sikandar Raza followed closely with an impressive 47 off 32 deliveries.\n\nDefending their total, the Chevrons were disciplined with the ball and sharp in the field, restricting Sri Lanka to 95 runs in their 20 overs.\n\nBrad Evans starred with the ball, taking three wickets, while Richard Ngarava chipped in with two. The rest of the bowling attack each picked up a wicket, contributing to a strong all-round performance.\n\nThe defeat marked a disappointing start for Sri Lanka in their Tri-Nations campaign, while Zimbabwe gained a confidence boost after their earlier loss to hosts Pakistan.\n\nSri Lanka will now take on Pakistan on Saturday to conclude the first-round fixtures, before the Chevrons face Pakistan again on Sunday as round two begins.\n\nThe tri-series serves as preparation for next years T20 World Cup, in which all three nations are set to participate.\n\n",

The Bank finalised a US$15 million Agrobond which was privately placed with a European Fund and will go towards supporting the agriculture sector, she said.\n\nDuring the period under review, the Group generated operating income of ZWG1.3 billion for the nine months to September 30, 2025.\n\nIn terms of the Groups core business, net interest income rose by 63% compared to the same period in 2024, driven by increased loans and advances to productive sectors and support for consumer needs. Core income streams remain resilient, supported by strong growth in loans and deposits, while management continues to prioritise revenue diversification and cost optimisation.\n\nThe Group incurred operating expenditure of ZWG1.1 billion, a 70% increase from the prior year. This variance primarily reflects the impact of strategic business reengineering initiatives undertaken during the year, including restructuring and staff rationalisation to align operations with the Groups strategic vision.\n\nTotal assets increased to ZWG9.2 billion, up 27% from ZWG7.3 billion recorded on December 31, 2024. The growth was anchored by an expansion in loans and advances, which stood at ZWG4.2 billion at the end of the quarter.\n\nThe domestic economy is projected to grow by 6.6% in 2025 in line with earlier projections in light of the sustained macroeconomic stability, record-high gold prices, growing remittances and a 12.8% rebound in agriculture following the 2024 El Nino.\n\nIn light of the above, the Group will continue to focus on supporting key sectors of the economy through its core business, Mutandwa added.\n\n",

Thebiggest fallswere recorded forheavyindustrialsand cash, according to Bank of America analysts.\n\nZimbabweanPGMproduction slipped 10% to 119 koz, largely reflecting significant destocking of semi-processed material at Unki, owned by Valterra.\n\nOutput from Zimplats,Zimbabweslargest producer, edged lower owing to furnace repairs.\n\nThus, PGM supply from Zimbabwe is expected to contract by 4% year-on-year to 493 koz, retreating from the record level achieved in 2024.\n\nThe decline primarily reflects the absence of a drawdown of semi-finished stock that boosted last years volumes, said WIPC.\n\n",
