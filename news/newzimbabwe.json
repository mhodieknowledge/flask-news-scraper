            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZANU PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa has slammed businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei, after the latters failed attempt to join the partys Central Committee.\n\nTagwirei was endorsed in May by Zanu PFs Harare Provincial chairman Godwills Masimirembwa to join the partys most powerful organ between congresses, the Central Committee.\n\nEarlier in July, he attended a Central Committee meeting, which he was chucked out of, with the party citing that his co-option into the Central Committee was still pending ratification.\n\nThe businessman who is reportedly eyeing presidency further promised Zanu PF Politburo and Central Committee top-of-the-range cars, a move which was widely interpreted as a bribe to influence the decision on his co-option.\n\nAddressing journalists on Monday, Mutsvangwa blasted Tagwirei for attempting to bribe his way into the partys organs and not following due processes prescribed in the Zanu PF Constitution.\n\nThere could have been an issue of bribes or cars and money, an issue of peddling influence, but in Zanu PF, it really doesnt pay because we are a party of long institutional memory about wherever we came from and along the way, we acquired knowledge about how we administer our party from our past experiences.\n\nTagwirei at a recent Zanu PF politburo meeting\n\nExplaining the circumstances leading to Tagwirei being ejected from the Zanu PF Central Committee meeting, Mutsvangwa said, The Constitution is very clear on how you can become a central committee member. Harare Province (led by Its chairman Goodwills Masimirembwa) might have had aspirations for him (Tagwirei) to become a central committee member but the party has its leadership.\n\nThe recommendations of Harare province were assessed whether they satisfy the eligibility. Sadly, for Harare province it wasnt the case. Their bid to support him was not successful.\n\nAdded Mutsvangwa, Zanu PF is a party for everyone, including business people. You can always go back and start again and go through the processes.\n\nIf you finally meet the tick box, you may find yourself in the Central Committee but, for the time being, you may not be satisfying those conditions.\n\nThe Central Committee was sitting and the tick box was looked at as to the eligibility of that person (Tagwirei) being in the meetingit was not successful.\n\nMutsvangwa further slammed Tagwirei for using his financial muscle to influence the top party members.\n\nElections are done by mass universal suffrage. So can you afford to bribe all provinces (whole country) with the money that was created at this building (Zanu PF HQ) because during Smith Regime, no one had such money?\n\nWe know the origin of that money. Do not try to use it against this (Zanu PF) partys popularity or the voting public. Respect the party which made them what they are and not try to use the money whose origin is the stewardshipof this party and the way it has run this economy. It will not work.\n\nI want Zimbabweans to be confident that Zanu PF as a mass party will not compromise on the integrity of the vote as the only way we express leadership in this country.\n\nAny other system which tries to subvert the vote by material means, inducement, it will not work in Zanu PF because it barks against the trade of sacrifice.\n\n",

That is what we are going with to the districts saying that vision balance brought forward is resolution number 1 because we have not yet fulfilled it then we focus on the other following resolutions.\n\nThat is the guidance that we have here. It is not an insult to anyone, it does not restrict ones opinion, but it is encouraging that we should have the same vision, said Garwe.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa has repeatedly refused to be drawn into discussions about extending his rule, insisting he is serving his final term.\n\nHowever, last years ZANU-PF conference resolved to prolong his tenure despite his public objections.\n\nTo extend Mnangagwas presidency, ZANU-PF would need to overcome constitutional hurdles, including amending Section 91(2), which bars him from running for another term, and Section 382(7), which prevents him from benefiting from such an amendment.\n\nWriting recently on the microblogging platform X, former cabinet minister Tendai Biti vowed that the opposition would resist ZANU-PFs attempts to extend Mnangagwas term.\n\nThey remain unrelenting on their quest for the vulgar 2030 Agenda. They think they can bribe anyone and everyone. The citizen is not anyone and everyone. We will fight back and resist the emasculation of our constitution, rule of law and our dignity, said Biti.\n\n",

Im just glad they got to see a glimpse of it today. This is only the beginning. That crowd reaction was something else. These are the moments I dream of.When I was backstage, I told my corner, Let me enjoy this moment.

Atef lacked the firepower to trouble the South African and became increasingly hesitant as the strikes piled up.Even when the Egyptian attempted to grapple, Ndebele stayed composed, expertly managing the exchanges with calculated movement, breath control, and positional dominance.Eventually, Ndebele dragged Atef to the canvas and unleashed a flurry of strikes to the body and head.

This is the first time Ive ever experienced such a crowd, a packed arena, a sold-out venue.\n\nNdebele looked composed from the first bell, controlling every aspect of the fight inside the PFL SmartCage. Atef lacked the firepower to trouble the South African and became increasingly hesitant as the strikes piled up.Even when the Egyptian attempted to grapple, Ndebele stayed composed, expertly managing the exchanges with calculated movement, breath control, and positional dominance.Eventually, Ndebele dragged Atef to the canvas and unleashed a flurry of strikes to the body and head. The referee was left with no choice but to wave it off with 10 seconds left in the first round, triggering wild celebrations as chants of Nkosi rang out across the arena.This is only the beginning. More spectacular victories are coming! said a jubilant Ndebele.

And the number increases as time goes on.\n\nSo we are saying 1,300 plus more each year, which means a large number of children are dying, said Machawira.\n\nHe also noted that for many children born with heart problems, receiving treatment after the age of two has limited impact, as they would have already been debilitated by the illness.\n\nOutside of the two camps with Egyptian specialists, Machawira said Parirenyatwa Hospital has performed around 55 open heart surgeries from June 2023 to date.\n\nZimbabwe has limited capacity to offer open heart surgeries due to a lack of resources and personnel while most patients with heart-related ailments cannot afford treatment abroad, where costs can be as high as US$15,000.\n\n",
