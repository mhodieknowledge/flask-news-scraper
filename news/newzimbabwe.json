This prompted her to alert the Ministry of Health, and a report was made to the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC), the State alleges further.This then led to Chigumiras arrest and the US$530 has not been recovered.\n\nThe complainant is Miriam Mverechana who allegedly lost US$530 to Chigumira.\n\nChigumira was not asked to plead and was remanded out of custody to January 19, 2025, on US$300 bail.According to court papers, sometime in June 2024, the Ministry of Health flighted an advert inviting interested applicants to submit applications for a two-year certificate in primary nursing training course.It is alleged that Chigumira connived with Evelyn Shonhiwa, who is still at large, to defraud unsuspecting individuals interested in the nurse training programme.They allegedly misrepresented that they were responsible for recruiting youths through the Zanu PF Medical Directorate, which Chigumira heads.The accused person purported that he had links with the Minister of Health and would use his proximity to facilitate securing a place for the complainants son (Dylan Kundai Huchu) to train as a primary care nurse, the State alleges.The two allegedly called Mverechena notifying her that she was supposed to pay US$800 as facilitation fee to enhance the opportunity and access to the scarce recruitment of her son.On August 2, 2024, at about 1500 hours the complainant and her son proceeded to Zanu PF headquarters with US$500 which the complainant had managed to raise instead of the proposed US$800.They met accused two (Shonhiwa) who is still at large outside the Zanu PF Headquarters gate who accompanied the complainant and her son to accuseds one (Chigumira)s motor vehicle which was parked inside Zanu PF Headquarters yard.The accused person then drove the complainant and her son together with Shonhiwa to his Afgate Surgery at corner Simon Muzenda and George Silundika Street, where the complainant gave Shonhiwa the US$500 who after counting the money queried why it was not amounting to US$800 before handing it over to the accused one, the State alleges further.The court heard that the accused persons then took the complainant and her son on a tour of Afgate Surgery assuring them that all was well because Chigumira was responsible for recruiting Zanu PF youths on behalf of the Ministry of Health hence her son was guaranteed to get recruited for the post he applied for.The court heard that Shonhiwa further demanded for more money citing that there were several stakeholders involved in the deal prompting the complainant to pay her US$30 through EcoCash before they departed Afgate Surgery.The complainants son did not get recruited for the primary nurse training course as promised in this case.

May I buttress that arrests will be effected, and the law will certainly take its course.\n\nMeanwhile, ZRP says it will be out in full force during this festive season to arrest those who intend to smuggle goods in and out of the country during the festive season.\n\nIt will deploy 24 hours roadblocks during this peak season in order to curb smuggling of gadgets, second hand clothes, cars and food items.\n\nMatanga said all importers and exporters should lead by example, failure of which the law will take its course if found sneaking in contraband.\n\nPolice officers will also take action against anyone found engaging in the smuggling of goods into and out of the country.\n\nMay I take this opportunity to encourage all individuals and institutions involved in the importation and exportation activities to lead by example and officially declare all goods at the countrys ports of entry and exit.\n\nThe law will take its course without fear or favour on transporters who are involved in smuggling activities and those using undesignated points along our border lines to commit crime, said Matanga.\n\nIn this regard, the Zimbabwe Republic Police has made adequate deployments to ensure that peace prevails throughout the period.\n\nThe deployments will include, heightened roadblocks, traffic blitz, stop and search,the motorized and cycle patrols to curb crime, road traffic accidents, maintain law and order Central Business Districts, residential, industrial as well leisure facilities to be frequented by the public while celebrating the countrys Unity Day, Christmas Day and New Years eve (2025).\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police urges all stakeholders who include transporters, to prioritize the safety and security of the public on the roads and all gatherings, said the commissioner-general.\n\nHe said ZRP deployed police officers on a blitz on all roads inorder to weed out unroadworthy cars which will be impounded, and all pirate taxis barred from passing checkpoints.\n\nAs road safety campaigns are being conducted, the Zimbabwe Republic Police shall impound all defective and unroadworthy vehicles.\n\nIn the same measure, the commuting public are discouraged from boarding non-public service vehicles for their own safety and other travellers. May I caution drivers to avoid overloading of vehicles and speeding on the roads.\n\nMay I, therefore, reiterate that road safety campaigns will include the components of education to prevent accidents, promote compliance with road rules and regulations and strict enforcement of the countrys laws to ensure that no pirate taxis or mushika-shika vehicles are allowed to pass through police check points, said Matanga.\n\nHe further cautioned Public Service Vehicle operators, both local and cross border to minimise night travelling as most fatal road traffic accidents are being recorded at night due to vision and observation challenges.\n\nMotorists and citizens should also avoid crossing flooded rivers and bridges and take note of the rainy season as the roads will be slippery.\n\nThe police chief said his office will also take action on reports of corruption on the countrys roads.\n\nHe also warned the public to be alert and safety conscious to curb cases of robbery, murder and other crimes.\n\nAs the public embarks on various activities during this festive period, families, businesspersons and institutions should avoid carrying or keeping large sums of money at home or offices to curb robbery and other related violent criminal acts, said Matanga\n\nThe police boss also warned that individuals who want to discharge fireworks and other gadgets that will likely disturb the safety and security of the general populace to first notify the police.\n\n",

This verse underscores the importance of having a clear vision for our nation, one that is not fixated on the next election but rather on sustainable development and prosperity. Our leaders must recognize that their primary responsibility is to serve the electorate through job creation and infrastructure development.\n\nThe current efforts being made by the government in roads and bridges construction as well as the current, parts of Harare roads facelift are commendable, yet these must be part of a larger strategy focused on empowering the underprivileged and ensuring food security, especially in rural areas.\n\nIn Micah 6:8, we are reminded of what the Lord requires of us: To act justly and to love mercy and to walk humbly with your God. Elected officials must embody these principles, leading with integrity and compassion rather than resorting to falsehoods, violence, intimidation and the use of machetes.\n\nThose who threaten the peace of our communities compromise the presidents 2030 vision for a prosperous Zimbabwe and jeopardize our collective future.\n\nAs we face the looming challenges of climate change and social inequity, our leaders must prioritize service provision over political posturing.\n\nThe recent increase in the community development fund by the minister of finance, from fifty thousand dollars to one hundred thousand dollars, is a step in the right direction. Leaders should focus on tangible results that uplift citizens rather than remaining in an election mode filled with empty promises and rhetoric.\n\nA Prayer for Zimbabwe\n\nHeavenly Father,We come before You with heavy hearts for our beloved Zimbabwe. We ask for Your guidance upon our leaders, that they may turn their focus from the next election to the urgent needs of our people. Grant them wisdom to prioritize development and job creation, to nurture peace and unity, and to serve with integrity.\n\nLord, we pray for those who are suffering from hunger and hardship. May Your provision flow abundantly to the vulnerable and underprivileged. Empower our leaders to be instruments of Your will, fostering a spirit of cooperation and compassion.\n\nAs we strive toward a brighter future, may our nation reflect Your love and grace.

            "content": "By BBC\n\nHIDEKO Hakamata, 91, fought half her life to free her brother  the worlds longest serving death row inmate.\n\nWhen a court declared Iwao Hakamata innocent in September, the worlds longest-serving death row inmate seemed unable to comprehend, much less savour the moment.I told him he was acquitted, and he was silent, Hideko Hakamata, his 91-year-old sister, tells the BBC at her home in Hamamatsu, Japan.I couldnt tell whetherheunderstood or not.Hidekohad been fighting for her brothers retrial ever since he was convicted of quadruple murder in 1968.In September 2024, at the age of 88, he was finally acquitted  ending Japans longest running legal saga.Mr Hakamatas case is remarkable. But it also shines a light on the systemic brutality underpinning Japans justice system, where death row inmates are only notified of their hanging a few hours in advance, and spend years unsure whether each day will be their last.Human rights experts have long condemned such treatment as cruel and inhuman, saying it exacerbates prisoners risk of developing a serious mental illness.And more than half a lifetime spent in solitary confinement, waiting to be executed for a crime he didnt commit, took a heavy toll on Mr Hakamata.Iwao Hakamata has been living with his sister, Hideko, since being granted a rare retrial in 2014. Since being granted a retrial and released from prison in 2014, he has lived under Hidekos close care.When we arrive at the apartment he is on his daily outing with a volunteer group that supports the two elderly siblings. He is anxious around strangers, Hideko explains, and has been in his own world for years.Maybe it cant be helped, she says. This is what happens when you are locked up and crammed in a small prison cell for more than 40 years.They made him live like an animal.Life on death rowA former professional boxer,Iwao Hakamata was working at a miso processing plant when the bodies of his boss, the mans wife and their two teenage children were found. All four had been stabbed to death.Authorities accused Mr Hakamata of murdering the family, setting their house in Shizuoka alight and stealing 200,000 yen (199; $556) in cash.We had no idea what was going on, Hideko says of the day in 1966 when police came to arrest her brother.The family home was searched, as well as the homes of their two elder sisters, and Mr Hakamata was taken away.He initially denied all charges, but later gave what he came to describe as a coerced confession following beatings and interrogations that lasted up to 12 hours a day.Two years after his arrest, MrHakamata was convicted of murder and arson and sentenced to death. It was when he was moved to a cell on death row that Hideko noticed a shift in his demeanour.One prison visit in particular stands out.He told me, there was an execution yesterday  it was a person in the next cell, she recalls.He told me to take care  and from then on, he completely changed mentally and became very quiet.Mr Hakamata is not the only one to be damaged by life on Japans death row, where inmates wake each morning not knowing if it will be their last.Between 08:00 and 08:30 in the morning was the most critical time, because that was generally when prisoners were notified of their execution, Menda Sakae, who spent 34 years on death row before being exonerated, wrote in a book about his experience.You begin to feel the most terrible anxiety, because you dont know if they are going to stop in front of your cell. It is impossible to express how awful a feeling this was.James Welsh, lead author of a 2009 Amnesty International report into conditions on death row, noted that the daily threat of imminent death is cruel, inhuman and degrading.The report concluded that inmates were at risk of significant mental health issues.Hideko could only watch as her own brothers mental health deteriorated as the years went by.Once he asked me Do you know who I am? I said, Yes, I do. You are Iwao Hakamata. No, he said, you must be here to see a different person. And he just went back [to his cell].Hideko stepped up as his primary spokesperson and advocate. It wasnt until 2014, however, that there was a breakthrough in his case.Hideko, 91, says she always felt the need to protect her little brotherA key piece of evidence against Mr Hakamata were red-stained clothes found in a miso tank at his workplace.They were recovered a year and two months after the murders and the prosecution said they belonged to him. But for years Mr Hakamatas defence team argued that the DNA recovered from the clothes did not match his  and alleged that the evidence was planted.In 2014 they were able to persuade a judge to release him from prison and grant him a retrial.Prolonged legal proceedings meant it took until last October for the retrial to begin. When it finally did, it was Hidekowho appeared in court, pleading for her brothers life.Mr Hakamatas fate hinged on the stains, and specifically how they had aged.The prosecution had claimed the stains were reddish when the clothes were recovered  but the defence argued that blood would have turned blackish after being immersed in miso for so long.That was enough to convince presiding judgeKoshi Kunii, who declared that the investigating authority had added blood stains and hid the items in the miso tank well after the incident took place.Judge Kunii further found that other evidence had been fabricated, including an investigation record, and declared Mr Hakamata innocent.Hidekos first reaction was to cry.When the judge said that the defendant is not guilty, I was elated; I was in tears, she says.I am not a tearful person, but mytearsjust flowed without stopping for about an hour.Hostage justiceThe courts conclusion that evidence against Mr Hakamata was fabricated raises troubling questions.Japan has a 99% conviction rate, and a system of so-called hostage justice which, according to Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch, denies people arrested their rights to a presumption of innocence, a prompt and fair bail hearing, and access to counsel during questioning.These abusive practices have resulted in lives and families being torn apart, as well as wrongful convictions, Ms Doi noted in 2023.David T Johnson, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose research focuses on criminal justice in Japan, has followed the Hakamata case for the last 30 years.He said one reason it dragged on is that critical evidence for the defence was not disclosed to them until around 2010.The failure was egregious and inexcusable, Mr Johnson told the BBC. Judges kept kicking the case down the road, as they frequently do in response to retrial petitions (because) they are busy, and the law allows them to do so.Hideko campaigned for years for her brothers retrialHidekosays the core of the injustice was the forced confession and the coercion her brother suffered.But Mr Johnson says false accusations dont happen because of a single mistake. Instead, they are compounded by failings at all levels  from the police right through to the prosecutors, courts and parliament.Judges have the last word, he added. When a wrongful conviction occurs, it is, in the end, because they said so. All too often, the responsibility of judges for producing and maintaining wrongful convictions gets neglected, elided, and ignored.Against that backdrop, Mr Hakamatas acquittal was a watershed  a rare moment of retrospective justice.After declaring Mr Hakamata innocent, the judge presiding over his retrial apologised toHidekofor how long it took to achieve justice.A short while later, Takayoshi Tsuda, chief of Shizuoka police, visitedherhome and bowed in front of both brother and sister.For the past 58 years we caused you indescribable anxiety and burden, Mr Tsuda said. We are truly sorry.Hideko gave an unexpected reply to the police chief.We believe that everything that happened was our destiny, she said.We will not complain about anything now.The pink doorAfter nearly 60 years of anxiety and heartache, Hideko has styled her home with the express intention of letting some light in. The rooms are bright and inviting, filled with pictures of her and Iwaoalongside family friends and supporters.Hideko laughs as she shares memories of her cute little brother as a baby, leafing through black-and-white family photos.The youngest of six siblings, he seems to always be standing next to her.We were always together when we were children, she explains.I always knew I had to take care of my little brother.And so, it continues.She walks into Mr Hakamatas room and introduces their ginger cat, which occupies the chair he normally sits in. Then she points to pictures of him as a young professional boxer.He wanted to become a champion, she says. Then the incident happened.After Mr Hakamata was released in 2014, Hideko wanted to make the apartment as bright as possible, she explains. So she painted the front door pink.I believed that if he was in a bright room and had a cheerful life, he would naturally get well.Its the first thing one notices when visiting Hidekos apartment, this bright pink statement of hope and resilience.Its unclear whether it has worked  Mr Hakamata still paces back and forth for hours, just as he did for years in a jail cell the size of three single tatami mats.But Hideko refuses to linger on the question of what their lives might have looked like if not for such an egregious miscarriage of justice.When asked who she blames for her brothers suffering, she replies: no-one.Complaining about what happened will get us nowhere.Her priority now is to keep her brother comfortable. She shaves his face, massages his head, slices apples and apricots for his breakfast each morning.Hideko, who has spent the majority of her 91 years fighting for her brothers freedom, says this was their fate.I dont want to think about the past. I dont know how long Im going to live, she says.I just want Iwao to live a peaceful and quiet life.\n\nWhen a court declared Iwao Hakamata innocent in September, the worlds longest-serving death row inmate seemed unable to comprehend, much less savour the moment.\n\nI told him he was acquitted, and he was silent, Hideko Hakamata, his 91-year-old sister, tells the BBC at her home in Hamamatsu, Japan.I couldnt tell whetherheunderstood or not.Hidekohad been fighting for her brothers retrial ever since he was convicted of quadruple murder in 1968.In September 2024, at the age of 88, he was finally acquitted  ending Japans longest running legal saga.Mr Hakamatas case is remarkable.

It was when he was moved to a cell on death row that Hideko noticed a shift in his demeanour.One prison visit in particular stands out.He told me, there was an execution yesterday  it was a person in the next cell, she recalls.He told me to take care  and from then on, he completely changed mentally and became very quiet.Mr Hakamata is not the only one to be damaged by life on Japans death row, where inmates wake each morning not knowing if it will be their last.Between 08:00 and 08:30 in the morning was the most critical time, because that was generally when prisoners were notified of their execution, Menda Sakae, who spent 34 years on death row before being exonerated, wrote in a book about his experience.You begin to feel the most terrible anxiety, because you dont know if they are going to stop in front of your cell. It is impossible to express how awful a feeling this was.James Welsh, lead author of a 2009 Amnesty International report into conditions on death row, noted that the daily threat of imminent death is cruel, inhuman and degrading.The report concluded that inmates were at risk of significant mental health issues.Hideko could only watch as her own brothers mental health deteriorated as the years went by.Once he asked me Do you know who I am? I said, Yes, I do. You are Iwao Hakamata. No, he said, you must be here to see a different person. And he just went back [to his cell].Hideko stepped up as his primary spokesperson and advocate. It wasnt until 2014, however, that there was a breakthrough in his case.Hideko, 91, says she always felt the need to protect her little brotherA key piece of evidence against Mr Hakamata were red-stained clothes found in a miso tank at his workplace.They were recovered a year and two months after the murders and the prosecution said they belonged to him. But for years Mr Hakamatas defence team argued that the DNA recovered from the clothes did not match his  and alleged that the evidence was planted.In 2014 they were able to persuade a judge to release him from prison and grant him a retrial.Prolonged legal proceedings meant it took until last October for the retrial to begin. When it finally did, it was Hidekowho appeared in court, pleading for her brothers life.Mr Hakamatas fate hinged on the stains, and specifically how they had aged.The prosecution had claimed the stains were reddish when the clothes were recovered  but the defence argued that blood would have turned blackish after being immersed in miso for so long.That was enough to convince presiding judgeKoshi Kunii, who declared that the investigating authority had added blood stains and hid the items in the miso tank well after the incident took place.Judge Kunii further found that other evidence had been fabricated, including an investigation record, and declared Mr Hakamata innocent.Hidekos first reaction was to cry.When the judge said that the defendant is not guilty, I was elated; I was in tears, she says.I am not a tearful person, but mytearsjust flowed without stopping for about an hour.Hostage justiceThe courts conclusion that evidence against Mr Hakamata was fabricated raises troubling questions.Japan has a 99% conviction rate, and a system of so-called hostage justice which, according to Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch, denies people arrested their rights to a presumption of innocence, a prompt and fair bail hearing, and access to counsel during questioning.These abusive practices have resulted in lives and families being torn apart, as well as wrongful convictions, Ms Doi noted in 2023.David T Johnson, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose research focuses on criminal justice in Japan, has followed the Hakamata case for the last 30 years.He said one reason it dragged on is that critical evidence for the defence was not disclosed to them until around 2010.The failure was egregious and inexcusable, Mr Johnson told the BBC. Judges kept kicking the case down the road, as they frequently do in response to retrial petitions (because) they are busy, and the law allows them to do so.Hideko campaigned for years for her brothers retrialHidekosays the core of the injustice was the forced confession and the coercion her brother suffered.But Mr Johnson says false accusations dont happen because of a single mistake. Instead, they are compounded by failings at all levels  from the police right through to the prosecutors, courts and parliament.Judges have the last word, he added. When a wrongful conviction occurs, it is, in the end, because they said so. All too often, the responsibility of judges for producing and maintaining wrongful convictions gets neglected, elided, and ignored.Against that backdrop, Mr Hakamatas acquittal was a watershed  a rare moment of retrospective justice.After declaring Mr Hakamata innocent, the judge presiding over his retrial apologised toHidekofor how long it took to achieve justice.A short while later, Takayoshi Tsuda, chief of Shizuoka police, visitedherhome and bowed in front of both brother and sister.For the past 58 years we caused you indescribable anxiety and burden, Mr Tsuda said. We are truly sorry.Hideko gave an unexpected reply to the police chief.We believe that everything that happened was our destiny, she said.We will not complain about anything now.The pink doorAfter nearly 60 years of anxiety and heartache, Hideko has styled her home with the express intention of letting some light in. The rooms are bright and inviting, filled with pictures of her and Iwaoalongside family friends and supporters.Hideko laughs as she shares memories of her cute little brother as a baby, leafing through black-and-white family photos.The youngest of six siblings, he seems to always be standing next to her.We were always together when we were children, she explains.I always knew I had to take care of my little brother.And so, it continues.She walks into Mr Hakamatas room and introduces their ginger cat, which occupies the chair he normally sits in. Then she points to pictures of him as a young professional boxer.He wanted to become a champion, she says. Then the incident happened.After Mr Hakamata was released in 2014, Hideko wanted to make the apartment as bright as possible, she explains. So she painted the front door pink.I believed that if he was in a bright room and had a cheerful life, he would naturally get well.Its the first thing one notices when visiting Hidekos apartment, this bright pink statement of hope and resilience.Its unclear whether it has worked  Mr Hakamata still paces back and forth for hours, just as he did for years in a jail cell the size of three single tatami mats.But Hideko refuses to linger on the question of what their lives might have looked like if not for such an egregious miscarriage of justice.When asked who she blames for her brothers suffering, she replies: no-one.Complaining about what happened will get us nowhere.Her priority now is to keep her brother comfortable. She shaves his face, massages his head, slices apples and apricots for his breakfast each morning.Hideko, who has spent the majority of her 91 years fighting for her brothers freedom, says this was their fate.I dont want to think about the past. I dont know how long Im going to live, she says.I just want Iwao to live a peaceful and quiet life.\n\nI told him he was acquitted, and he was silent, Hideko Hakamata, his 91-year-old sister, tells the BBC at her home in Hamamatsu, Japan.\n\nI couldnt tell whetherheunderstood or not.Hidekohad been fighting for her brothers retrial ever since he was convicted of quadruple murder in 1968.In September 2024, at the age of 88, he was finally acquitted  ending Japans longest running legal saga.Mr Hakamatas case is remarkable. But it also shines a light on the systemic brutality underpinning Japans justice system, where death row inmates are only notified of their hanging a few hours in advance, and spend years unsure whether each day will be their last.Human rights experts have long condemned such treatment as cruel and inhuman, saying it exacerbates prisoners risk of developing a serious mental illness.And more than half a lifetime spent in solitary confinement, waiting to be executed for a crime he didnt commit, took a heavy toll on Mr Hakamata.Iwao Hakamata has been living with his sister, Hideko, since being granted a rare retrial in 2014. Since being granted a retrial and released from prison in 2014, he has lived under Hidekos close care.When we arrive at the apartment he is on his daily outing with a volunteer group that supports the two elderly siblings.

She shaves his face, massages his head, slices apples and apricots for his breakfast each morning.Hideko, who has spent the majority of her 91 years fighting for her brothers freedom, says this was their fate.I dont want to think about the past. I dont know how long Im going to live, she says.I just want Iwao to live a peaceful and quiet life.\n\nIn September 2024, at the age of 88, he was finally acquitted  ending Japans longest running legal saga.\n\nMr Hakamatas case is remarkable. But it also shines a light on the systemic brutality underpinning Japans justice system, where death row inmates are only notified of their hanging a few hours in advance, and spend years unsure whether each day will be their last.Human rights experts have long condemned such treatment as cruel and inhuman, saying it exacerbates prisoners risk of developing a serious mental illness.And more than half a lifetime spent in solitary confinement, waiting to be executed for a crime he didnt commit, took a heavy toll on Mr Hakamata.Iwao Hakamata has been living with his sister, Hideko, since being granted a rare retrial in 2014. Since being granted a retrial and released from prison in 2014, he has lived under Hidekos close care.When we arrive at the apartment he is on his daily outing with a volunteer group that supports the two elderly siblings. He is anxious around strangers, Hideko explains, and has been in his own world for years.Maybe it cant be helped, she says. This is what happens when you are locked up and crammed in a small prison cell for more than 40 years.They made him live like an animal.Life on death rowA former professional boxer,Iwao Hakamata was working at a miso processing plant when the bodies of his boss, the mans wife and their two teenage children were found. All four had been stabbed to death.Authorities accused Mr Hakamata of murdering the family, setting their house in Shizuoka alight and stealing 200,000 yen (199; $556) in cash.We had no idea what was going on, Hideko says of the day in 1966 when police came to arrest her brother.The family home was searched, as well as the homes of their two elder sisters, and Mr Hakamata was taken away.He initially denied all charges, but later gave what he came to describe as a coerced confession following beatings and interrogations that lasted up to 12 hours a day.Two years after his arrest, MrHakamata was convicted of murder and arson and sentenced to death. It was when he was moved to a cell on death row that Hideko noticed a shift in his demeanour.One prison visit in particular stands out.He told me, there was an execution yesterday  it was a person in the next cell, she recalls.He told me to take care  and from then on, he completely changed mentally and became very quiet.Mr Hakamata is not the only one to be damaged by life on Japans death row, where inmates wake each morning not knowing if it will be their last.Between 08:00 and 08:30 in the morning was the most critical time, because that was generally when prisoners were notified of their execution, Menda Sakae, who spent 34 years on death row before being exonerated, wrote in a book about his experience.You begin to feel the most terrible anxiety, because you dont know if they are going to stop in front of your cell. It is impossible to express how awful a feeling this was.James Welsh, lead author of a 2009 Amnesty International report into conditions on death row, noted that the daily threat of imminent death is cruel, inhuman and degrading.The report concluded that inmates were at risk of significant mental health issues.Hideko could only watch as her own brothers mental health deteriorated as the years went by.Once he asked me Do you know who I am? I said, Yes, I do. You are Iwao Hakamata. No, he said, you must be here to see a different person. And he just went back [to his cell].Hideko stepped up as his primary spokesperson and advocate. It wasnt until 2014, however, that there was a breakthrough in his case.Hideko, 91, says she always felt the need to protect her little brotherA key piece of evidence against Mr Hakamata were red-stained clothes found in a miso tank at his workplace.They were recovered a year and two months after the murders and the prosecution said they belonged to him. But for years Mr Hakamatas defence team argued that the DNA recovered from the clothes did not match his  and alleged that the evidence was planted.In 2014 they were able to persuade a judge to release him from prison and grant him a retrial.Prolonged legal proceedings meant it took until last October for the retrial to begin. When it finally did, it was Hidekowho appeared in court, pleading for her brothers life.Mr Hakamatas fate hinged on the stains, and specifically how they had aged.The prosecution had claimed the stains were reddish when the clothes were recovered  but the defence argued that blood would have turned blackish after being immersed in miso for so long.That was enough to convince presiding judgeKoshi Kunii, who declared that the investigating authority had added blood stains and hid the items in the miso tank well after the incident took place.Judge Kunii further found that other evidence had been fabricated, including an investigation record, and declared Mr Hakamata innocent.Hidekos first reaction was to cry.When the judge said that the defendant is not guilty, I was elated; I was in tears, she says.I am not a tearful person, but mytearsjust flowed without stopping for about an hour.Hostage justiceThe courts conclusion that evidence against Mr Hakamata was fabricated raises troubling questions.Japan has a 99% conviction rate, and a system of so-called hostage justice which, according to Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch, denies people arrested their rights to a presumption of innocence, a prompt and fair bail hearing, and access to counsel during questioning.These abusive practices have resulted in lives and families being torn apart, as well as wrongful convictions, Ms Doi noted in 2023.David T Johnson, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose research focuses on criminal justice in Japan, has followed the Hakamata case for the last 30 years.He said one reason it dragged on is that critical evidence for the defence was not disclosed to them until around 2010.The failure was egregious and inexcusable, Mr Johnson told the BBC. Judges kept kicking the case down the road, as they frequently do in response to retrial petitions (because) they are busy, and the law allows them to do so.Hideko campaigned for years for her brothers retrialHidekosays the core of the injustice was the forced confession and the coercion her brother suffered.But Mr Johnson says false accusations dont happen because of a single mistake. Instead, they are compounded by failings at all levels  from the police right through to the prosecutors, courts and parliament.Judges have the last word, he added. When a wrongful conviction occurs, it is, in the end, because they said so. All too often, the responsibility of judges for producing and maintaining wrongful convictions gets neglected, elided, and ignored.Against that backdrop, Mr Hakamatas acquittal was a watershed  a rare moment of retrospective justice.After declaring Mr Hakamata innocent, the judge presiding over his retrial apologised toHidekofor how long it took to achieve justice.A short while later, Takayoshi Tsuda, chief of Shizuoka police, visitedherhome and bowed in front of both brother and sister.For the past 58 years we caused you indescribable anxiety and burden, Mr Tsuda said. We are truly sorry.Hideko gave an unexpected reply to the police chief.We believe that everything that happened was our destiny, she said.We will not complain about anything now.The pink doorAfter nearly 60 years of anxiety and heartache, Hideko has styled her home with the express intention of letting some light in.

The rooms are bright and inviting, filled with pictures of her and Iwaoalongside family friends and supporters.Hideko laughs as she shares memories of her cute little brother as a baby, leafing through black-and-white family photos.The youngest of six siblings, he seems to always be standing next to her.We were always together when we were children, she explains.I always knew I had to take care of my little brother.And so, it continues.She walks into Mr Hakamatas room and introduces their ginger cat, which occupies the chair he normally sits in. Then she points to pictures of him as a young professional boxer.He wanted to become a champion, she says. Then the incident happened.After Mr Hakamata was released in 2014, Hideko wanted to make the apartment as bright as possible, she explains. So she painted the front door pink.I believed that if he was in a bright room and had a cheerful life, he would naturally get well.Its the first thing one notices when visiting Hidekos apartment, this bright pink statement of hope and resilience.Its unclear whether it has worked  Mr Hakamata still paces back and forth for hours, just as he did for years in a jail cell the size of three single tatami mats.But Hideko refuses to linger on the question of what their lives might have looked like if not for such an egregious miscarriage of justice.When asked who she blames for her brothers suffering, she replies: no-one.Complaining about what happened will get us nowhere.Her priority now is to keep her brother comfortable. She shaves his face, massages his head, slices apples and apricots for his breakfast each morning.Hideko, who has spent the majority of her 91 years fighting for her brothers freedom, says this was their fate.I dont want to think about the past. I dont know how long Im going to live, she says.I just want Iwao to live a peaceful and quiet life.\n\nIwao Hakamata has been living with his sister, Hideko, since being granted a rare retrial in 2014. Since being granted a retrial and released from prison in 2014, he has lived under Hidekos close care.\n\nWhen we arrive at the apartment he is on his daily outing with a volunteer group that supports the two elderly siblings. He is anxious around strangers, Hideko explains, and has been in his own world for years.Maybe it cant be helped, she says. This is what happens when you are locked up and crammed in a small prison cell for more than 40 years.They made him live like an animal.Life on death rowA former professional boxer,Iwao Hakamata was working at a miso processing plant when the bodies of his boss, the mans wife and their two teenage children were found. All four had been stabbed to death.Authorities accused Mr Hakamata of murdering the family, setting their house in Shizuoka alight and stealing 200,000 yen (199; $556) in cash.We had no idea what was going on, Hideko says of the day in 1966 when police came to arrest her brother.The family home was searched, as well as the homes of their two elder sisters, and Mr Hakamata was taken away.He initially denied all charges, but later gave what he came to describe as a coerced confession following beatings and interrogations that lasted up to 12 hours a day.Two years after his arrest, MrHakamata was convicted of murder and arson and sentenced to death. It was when he was moved to a cell on death row that Hideko noticed a shift in his demeanour.One prison visit in particular stands out.He told me, there was an execution yesterday  it was a person in the next cell, she recalls.He told me to take care  and from then on, he completely changed mentally and became very quiet.Mr Hakamata is not the only one to be damaged by life on Japans death row, where inmates wake each morning not knowing if it will be their last.Between 08:00 and 08:30 in the morning was the most critical time, because that was generally when prisoners were notified of their execution, Menda Sakae, who spent 34 years on death row before being exonerated, wrote in a book about his experience.You begin to feel the most terrible anxiety, because you dont know if they are going to stop in front of your cell. It is impossible to express how awful a feeling this was.James Welsh, lead author of a 2009 Amnesty International report into conditions on death row, noted that the daily threat of imminent death is cruel, inhuman and degrading.The report concluded that inmates were at risk of significant mental health issues.Hideko could only watch as her own brothers mental health deteriorated as the years went by.Once he asked me Do you know who I am? I said, Yes, I do. You are Iwao Hakamata. No, he said, you must be here to see a different person. And he just went back [to his cell].Hideko stepped up as his primary spokesperson and advocate. It wasnt until 2014, however, that there was a breakthrough in his case.Hideko, 91, says she always felt the need to protect her little brotherA key piece of evidence against Mr Hakamata were red-stained clothes found in a miso tank at his workplace.They were recovered a year and two months after the murders and the prosecution said they belonged to him. But for years Mr Hakamatas defence team argued that the DNA recovered from the clothes did not match his  and alleged that the evidence was planted.In 2014 they were able to persuade a judge to release him from prison and grant him a retrial.Prolonged legal proceedings meant it took until last October for the retrial to begin. When it finally did, it was Hidekowho appeared in court, pleading for her brothers life.Mr Hakamatas fate hinged on the stains, and specifically how they had aged.The prosecution had claimed the stains were reddish when the clothes were recovered  but the defence argued that blood would have turned blackish after being immersed in miso for so long.That was enough to convince presiding judgeKoshi Kunii, who declared that the investigating authority had added blood stains and hid the items in the miso tank well after the incident took place.Judge Kunii further found that other evidence had been fabricated, including an investigation record, and declared Mr Hakamata innocent.Hidekos first reaction was to cry.When the judge said that the defendant is not guilty, I was elated; I was in tears, she says.I am not a tearful person, but mytearsjust flowed without stopping for about an hour.Hostage justiceThe courts conclusion that evidence against Mr Hakamata was fabricated raises troubling questions.Japan has a 99% conviction rate, and a system of so-called hostage justice which, according to Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch, denies people arrested their rights to a presumption of innocence, a prompt and fair bail hearing, and access to counsel during questioning.These abusive practices have resulted in lives and families being torn apart, as well as wrongful convictions, Ms Doi noted in 2023.David T Johnson, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose research focuses on criminal justice in Japan, has followed the Hakamata case for the last 30 years.He said one reason it dragged on is that critical evidence for the defence was not disclosed to them until around 2010.The failure was egregious and inexcusable, Mr Johnson told the BBC. Judges kept kicking the case down the road, as they frequently do in response to retrial petitions (because) they are busy, and the law allows them to do so.Hideko campaigned for years for her brothers retrialHidekosays the core of the injustice was the forced confession and the coercion her brother suffered.But Mr Johnson says false accusations dont happen because of a single mistake. Instead, they are compounded by failings at all levels  from the police right through to the prosecutors, courts and parliament.Judges have the last word, he added.

I dont know how long Im going to live, she says.I just want Iwao to live a peaceful and quiet life.\n\nLife on death row\n\nA former professional boxer,Iwao Hakamata was working at a miso processing plant when the bodies of his boss, the mans wife and their two teenage children were found. All four had been stabbed to death.\n\nAuthorities accused Mr Hakamata of murdering the family, setting their house in Shizuoka alight and stealing 200,000 yen (199; $556) in cash.We had no idea what was going on, Hideko says of the day in 1966 when police came to arrest her brother.The family home was searched, as well as the homes of their two elder sisters, and Mr Hakamata was taken away.He initially denied all charges, but later gave what he came to describe as a coerced confession following beatings and interrogations that lasted up to 12 hours a day.Two years after his arrest, MrHakamata was convicted of murder and arson and sentenced to death. It was when he was moved to a cell on death row that Hideko noticed a shift in his demeanour.One prison visit in particular stands out.He told me, there was an execution yesterday  it was a person in the next cell, she recalls.He told me to take care  and from then on, he completely changed mentally and became very quiet.Mr Hakamata is not the only one to be damaged by life on Japans death row, where inmates wake each morning not knowing if it will be their last.Between 08:00 and 08:30 in the morning was the most critical time, because that was generally when prisoners were notified of their execution, Menda Sakae, who spent 34 years on death row before being exonerated, wrote in a book about his experience.You begin to feel the most terrible anxiety, because you dont know if they are going to stop in front of your cell. It is impossible to express how awful a feeling this was.James Welsh, lead author of a 2009 Amnesty International report into conditions on death row, noted that the daily threat of imminent death is cruel, inhuman and degrading.The report concluded that inmates were at risk of significant mental health issues.Hideko could only watch as her own brothers mental health deteriorated as the years went by.Once he asked me Do you know who I am? I said, Yes, I do. You are Iwao Hakamata. No, he said, you must be here to see a different person. And he just went back [to his cell].Hideko stepped up as his primary spokesperson and advocate. It wasnt until 2014, however, that there was a breakthrough in his case.Hideko, 91, says she always felt the need to protect her little brotherA key piece of evidence against Mr Hakamata were red-stained clothes found in a miso tank at his workplace.They were recovered a year and two months after the murders and the prosecution said they belonged to him. But for years Mr Hakamatas defence team argued that the DNA recovered from the clothes did not match his  and alleged that the evidence was planted.In 2014 they were able to persuade a judge to release him from prison and grant him a retrial.Prolonged legal proceedings meant it took until last October for the retrial to begin. When it finally did, it was Hidekowho appeared in court, pleading for her brothers life.Mr Hakamatas fate hinged on the stains, and specifically how they had aged.The prosecution had claimed the stains were reddish when the clothes were recovered  but the defence argued that blood would have turned blackish after being immersed in miso for so long.That was enough to convince presiding judgeKoshi Kunii, who declared that the investigating authority had added blood stains and hid the items in the miso tank well after the incident took place.Judge Kunii further found that other evidence had been fabricated, including an investigation record, and declared Mr Hakamata innocent.Hidekos first reaction was to cry.When the judge said that the defendant is not guilty, I was elated; I was in tears, she says.I am not a tearful person, but mytearsjust flowed without stopping for about an hour.Hostage justiceThe courts conclusion that evidence against Mr Hakamata was fabricated raises troubling questions.Japan has a 99% conviction rate, and a system of so-called hostage justice which, according to Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch, denies people arrested their rights to a presumption of innocence, a prompt and fair bail hearing, and access to counsel during questioning.These abusive practices have resulted in lives and families being torn apart, as well as wrongful convictions, Ms Doi noted in 2023.David T Johnson, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose research focuses on criminal justice in Japan, has followed the Hakamata case for the last 30 years.He said one reason it dragged on is that critical evidence for the defence was not disclosed to them until around 2010.The failure was egregious and inexcusable, Mr Johnson told the BBC. Judges kept kicking the case down the road, as they frequently do in response to retrial petitions (because) they are busy, and the law allows them to do so.Hideko campaigned for years for her brothers retrialHidekosays the core of the injustice was the forced confession and the coercion her brother suffered.But Mr Johnson says false accusations dont happen because of a single mistake. Instead, they are compounded by failings at all levels  from the police right through to the prosecutors, courts and parliament.Judges have the last word, he added. When a wrongful conviction occurs, it is, in the end, because they said so. All too often, the responsibility of judges for producing and maintaining wrongful convictions gets neglected, elided, and ignored.Against that backdrop, Mr Hakamatas acquittal was a watershed  a rare moment of retrospective justice.After declaring Mr Hakamata innocent, the judge presiding over his retrial apologised toHidekofor how long it took to achieve justice.A short while later, Takayoshi Tsuda, chief of Shizuoka police, visitedherhome and bowed in front of both brother and sister.For the past 58 years we caused you indescribable anxiety and burden, Mr Tsuda said. We are truly sorry.Hideko gave an unexpected reply to the police chief.We believe that everything that happened was our destiny, she said.We will not complain about anything now.The pink doorAfter nearly 60 years of anxiety and heartache, Hideko has styled her home with the express intention of letting some light in. The rooms are bright and inviting, filled with pictures of her and Iwaoalongside family friends and supporters.Hideko laughs as she shares memories of her cute little brother as a baby, leafing through black-and-white family photos.The youngest of six siblings, he seems to always be standing next to her.We were always together when we were children, she explains.I always knew I had to take care of my little brother.And so, it continues.She walks into Mr Hakamatas room and introduces their ginger cat, which occupies the chair he normally sits in. Then she points to pictures of him as a young professional boxer.He wanted to become a champion, she says. Then the incident happened.After Mr Hakamata was released in 2014, Hideko wanted to make the apartment as bright as possible, she explains.

When it finally did, it was Hidekowho appeared in court, pleading for her brothers life.Mr Hakamatas fate hinged on the stains, and specifically how they had aged.The prosecution had claimed the stains were reddish when the clothes were recovered  but the defence argued that blood would have turned blackish after being immersed in miso for so long.That was enough to convince presiding judgeKoshi Kunii, who declared that the investigating authority had added blood stains and hid the items in the miso tank well after the incident took place.Judge Kunii further found that other evidence had been fabricated, including an investigation record, and declared Mr Hakamata innocent.Hidekos first reaction was to cry.When the judge said that the defendant is not guilty, I was elated; I was in tears, she says.I am not a tearful person, but mytearsjust flowed without stopping for about an hour.Hostage justiceThe courts conclusion that evidence against Mr Hakamata was fabricated raises troubling questions.Japan has a 99% conviction rate, and a system of so-called hostage justice which, according to Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch, denies people arrested their rights to a presumption of innocence, a prompt and fair bail hearing, and access to counsel during questioning.These abusive practices have resulted in lives and families being torn apart, as well as wrongful convictions, Ms Doi noted in 2023.David T Johnson, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose research focuses on criminal justice in Japan, has followed the Hakamata case for the last 30 years.He said one reason it dragged on is that critical evidence for the defence was not disclosed to them until around 2010.The failure was egregious and inexcusable, Mr Johnson told the BBC. Judges kept kicking the case down the road, as they frequently do in response to retrial petitions (because) they are busy, and the law allows them to do so.Hideko campaigned for years for her brothers retrialHidekosays the core of the injustice was the forced confession and the coercion her brother suffered.But Mr Johnson says false accusations dont happen because of a single mistake. Instead, they are compounded by failings at all levels  from the police right through to the prosecutors, courts and parliament.Judges have the last word, he added. When a wrongful conviction occurs, it is, in the end, because they said so. All too often, the responsibility of judges for producing and maintaining wrongful convictions gets neglected, elided, and ignored.Against that backdrop, Mr Hakamatas acquittal was a watershed  a rare moment of retrospective justice.After declaring Mr Hakamata innocent, the judge presiding over his retrial apologised toHidekofor how long it took to achieve justice.A short while later, Takayoshi Tsuda, chief of Shizuoka police, visitedherhome and bowed in front of both brother and sister.For the past 58 years we caused you indescribable anxiety and burden, Mr Tsuda said. We are truly sorry.Hideko gave an unexpected reply to the police chief.We believe that everything that happened was our destiny, she said.We will not complain about anything now.The pink doorAfter nearly 60 years of anxiety and heartache, Hideko has styled her home with the express intention of letting some light in. The rooms are bright and inviting, filled with pictures of her and Iwaoalongside family friends and supporters.Hideko laughs as she shares memories of her cute little brother as a baby, leafing through black-and-white family photos.The youngest of six siblings, he seems to always be standing next to her.We were always together when we were children, she explains.I always knew I had to take care of my little brother.And so, it continues.She walks into Mr Hakamatas room and introduces their ginger cat, which occupies the chair he normally sits in. Then she points to pictures of him as a young professional boxer.He wanted to become a champion, she says. Then the incident happened.After Mr Hakamata was released in 2014, Hideko wanted to make the apartment as bright as possible, she explains. So she painted the front door pink.I believed that if he was in a bright room and had a cheerful life, he would naturally get well.Its the first thing one notices when visiting Hidekos apartment, this bright pink statement of hope and resilience.Its unclear whether it has worked  Mr Hakamata still paces back and forth for hours, just as he did for years in a jail cell the size of three single tatami mats.But Hideko refuses to linger on the question of what their lives might have looked like if not for such an egregious miscarriage of justice.When asked who she blames for her brothers suffering, she replies: no-one.Complaining about what happened will get us nowhere.Her priority now is to keep her brother comfortable. She shaves his face, massages his head, slices apples and apricots for his breakfast each morning.Hideko, who has spent the majority of her 91 years fighting for her brothers freedom, says this was their fate.I dont want to think about the past. I dont know how long Im going to live, she says.I just want Iwao to live a peaceful and quiet life.\n\nTwo years after his arrest, MrHakamata was convicted of murder and arson and sentenced to death. It was when he was moved to a cell on death row that Hideko noticed a shift in his demeanour.\n\nOne prison visit in particular stands out.He told me, there was an execution yesterday  it was a person in the next cell, she recalls.He told me to take care  and from then on, he completely changed mentally and became very quiet.Mr Hakamata is not the only one to be damaged by life on Japans death row, where inmates wake each morning not knowing if it will be their last.Between 08:00 and 08:30 in the morning was the most critical time, because that was generally when prisoners were notified of their execution, Menda Sakae, who spent 34 years on death row before being exonerated, wrote in a book about his experience.You begin to feel the most terrible anxiety, because you dont know if they are going to stop in front of your cell. It is impossible to express how awful a feeling this was.James Welsh, lead author of a 2009 Amnesty International report into conditions on death row, noted that the daily threat of imminent death is cruel, inhuman and degrading.The report concluded that inmates were at risk of significant mental health issues.Hideko could only watch as her own brothers mental health deteriorated as the years went by.Once he asked me Do you know who I am? I said, Yes, I do. You are Iwao Hakamata. No, he said, you must be here to see a different person. And he just went back [to his cell].Hideko stepped up as his primary spokesperson and advocate.

When it finally did, it was Hidekowho appeared in court, pleading for her brothers life.Mr Hakamatas fate hinged on the stains, and specifically how they had aged.The prosecution had claimed the stains were reddish when the clothes were recovered  but the defence argued that blood would have turned blackish after being immersed in miso for so long.That was enough to convince presiding judgeKoshi Kunii, who declared that the investigating authority had added blood stains and hid the items in the miso tank well after the incident took place.Judge Kunii further found that other evidence had been fabricated, including an investigation record, and declared Mr Hakamata innocent.Hidekos first reaction was to cry.When the judge said that the defendant is not guilty, I was elated; I was in tears, she says.I am not a tearful person, but mytearsjust flowed without stopping for about an hour.Hostage justiceThe courts conclusion that evidence against Mr Hakamata was fabricated raises troubling questions.Japan has a 99% conviction rate, and a system of so-called hostage justice which, according to Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch, denies people arrested their rights to a presumption of innocence, a prompt and fair bail hearing, and access to counsel during questioning.These abusive practices have resulted in lives and families being torn apart, as well as wrongful convictions, Ms Doi noted in 2023.David T Johnson, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose research focuses on criminal justice in Japan, has followed the Hakamata case for the last 30 years.He said one reason it dragged on is that critical evidence for the defence was not disclosed to them until around 2010.The failure was egregious and inexcusable, Mr Johnson told the BBC.

When a wrongful conviction occurs, it is, in the end, because they said so. All too often, the responsibility of judges for producing and maintaining wrongful convictions gets neglected, elided, and ignored.Against that backdrop, Mr Hakamatas acquittal was a watershed  a rare moment of retrospective justice.After declaring Mr Hakamata innocent, the judge presiding over his retrial apologised toHidekofor how long it took to achieve justice.A short while later, Takayoshi Tsuda, chief of Shizuoka police, visitedherhome and bowed in front of both brother and sister.For the past 58 years we caused you indescribable anxiety and burden, Mr Tsuda said. We are truly sorry.Hideko gave an unexpected reply to the police chief.We believe that everything that happened was our destiny, she said.We will not complain about anything now.The pink doorAfter nearly 60 years of anxiety and heartache, Hideko has styled her home with the express intention of letting some light in.

She shaves his face, massages his head, slices apples and apricots for his breakfast each morning.Hideko, who has spent the majority of her 91 years fighting for her brothers freedom, says this was their fate.I dont want to think about the past. I dont know how long Im going to live, she says.I just want Iwao to live a peaceful and quiet life.\n\nBetween 08:00 and 08:30 in the morning was the most critical time, because that was generally when prisoners were notified of their execution, Menda Sakae, who spent 34 years on death row before being exonerated, wrote in a book about his experience.\n\nYou begin to feel the most terrible anxiety, because you dont know if they are going to stop in front of your cell.

She shaves his face, massages his head, slices apples and apricots for his breakfast each morning.Hideko, who has spent the majority of her 91 years fighting for her brothers freedom, says this was their fate.I dont want to think about the past. I dont know how long Im going to live, she says.I just want Iwao to live a peaceful and quiet life.\n\nOnce he asked me Do you know who I am? I said, Yes, I do. You are Iwao Hakamata. No, he said, you must be here to see a different person. And he just went back [to his cell].\n\nHideko stepped up as his primary spokesperson and advocate. It wasnt until 2014, however, that there was a breakthrough in his case.Hideko, 91, says she always felt the need to protect her little brotherA key piece of evidence against Mr Hakamata were red-stained clothes found in a miso tank at his workplace.They were recovered a year and two months after the murders and the prosecution said they belonged to him. But for years Mr Hakamatas defence team argued that the DNA recovered from the clothes did not match his  and alleged that the evidence was planted.In 2014 they were able to persuade a judge to release him from prison and grant him a retrial.Prolonged legal proceedings meant it took until last October for the retrial to begin. When it finally did, it was Hidekowho appeared in court, pleading for her brothers life.Mr Hakamatas fate hinged on the stains, and specifically how they had aged.The prosecution had claimed the stains were reddish when the clothes were recovered  but the defence argued that blood would have turned blackish after being immersed in miso for so long.That was enough to convince presiding judgeKoshi Kunii, who declared that the investigating authority had added blood stains and hid the items in the miso tank well after the incident took place.Judge Kunii further found that other evidence had been fabricated, including an investigation record, and declared Mr Hakamata innocent.Hidekos first reaction was to cry.When the judge said that the defendant is not guilty, I was elated; I was in tears, she says.I am not a tearful person, but mytearsjust flowed without stopping for about an hour.Hostage justiceThe courts conclusion that evidence against Mr Hakamata was fabricated raises troubling questions.Japan has a 99% conviction rate, and a system of so-called hostage justice which, according to Kanae Doi, Japan director at Human Rights Watch, denies people arrested their rights to a presumption of innocence, a prompt and fair bail hearing, and access to counsel during questioning.These abusive practices have resulted in lives and families being torn apart, as well as wrongful convictions, Ms Doi noted in 2023.David T Johnson, a professor of sociology at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, whose research focuses on criminal justice in Japan, has followed the Hakamata case for the last 30 years.He said one reason it dragged on is that critical evidence for the defence was not disclosed to them until around 2010.The failure was egregious and inexcusable, Mr Johnson told the BBC. Judges kept kicking the case down the road, as they frequently do in response to retrial petitions (because) they are busy, and the law allows them to do so.Hideko campaigned for years for her brothers retrialHidekosays the core of the injustice was the forced confession and the coercion her brother suffered.But Mr Johnson says false accusations dont happen because of a single mistake. Instead, they are compounded by failings at all levels  from the police right through to the prosecutors, courts and parliament.Judges have the last word, he added. When a wrongful conviction occurs, it is, in the end, because they said so. All too often, the responsibility of judges for producing and maintaining wrongful convictions gets neglected, elided, and ignored.Against that backdrop, Mr Hakamatas acquittal was a watershed  a rare moment of retrospective justice.After declaring Mr Hakamata innocent, the judge presiding over his retrial apologised toHidekofor how long it took to achieve justice.A short while later, Takayoshi Tsuda, chief of Shizuoka police, visitedherhome and bowed in front of both brother and sister.For the past 58 years we caused you indescribable anxiety and burden, Mr Tsuda said. We are truly sorry.Hideko gave an unexpected reply to the police chief.We believe that everything that happened was our destiny, she said.We will not complain about anything now.The pink doorAfter nearly 60 years of anxiety and heartache, Hideko has styled her home with the express intention of letting some light in. The rooms are bright and inviting, filled with pictures of her and Iwaoalongside family friends and supporters.Hideko laughs as she shares memories of her cute little brother as a baby, leafing through black-and-white family photos.The youngest of six siblings, he seems to always be standing next to her.We were always together when we were children, she explains.I always knew I had to take care of my little brother.And so, it continues.She walks into Mr Hakamatas room and introduces their ginger cat, which occupies the chair he normally sits in.

            "content": "By IOL\n\nGRATEFUL to be alive, the Hollywood icon peeled back the covers on his mystery medical setback in April 2003 with his observational humour intermingled with raw emotions that, at times, left him choked up with emotion.\n\nOf course, there was no better vehicle to share his story than through comedy  his bedrock in the industry.His Netflix special, What Had Happened Was, saw the award-winning actor, who is also a revered singer, unpack his journey to fans in Atlanta.Interestingly, he was filming Back in Action with Cameron Diaz around the time that the life-changing incident happened.At the time, his protective eldest daughter Corinne Foxx clamped down on paparazzi by stating that he was hospitalised for a medical complication.Of course, it was only fitting that Corinne introduced her beloved dad on stage for the show.Counting his blessing, he said: Im happy to be alive.What made it more special was that his life was saved by a white doctor wearing a Lakers jersey.He admitted: It is a mystery, we still dont know exactly what happened to me. I was having a bad headache, and I asked my boy for an aspirin. Before I could get the aspirin, I went out. I dont remember 20 days.What they told me was they took me to the first doctor, and they gave me a cortisone shot and sent me home.I dont know if you can do Yelps for doctors but thats half a star. My sister said No. Four foot eleven, and full of nothing but love, she said somethings wrong with my brother.The tenacity of his sister Deidra Dixon made a huge difference in saving his life as she took him to Piedmont Hospital where Dr Schuette explained that he was having a brain bleed that led to a stroke.Of course, he addressed the conspiracy theories around his illness, which varied from it being linked to the Covid vaccine to his dying.There were also whispers of him being poisoned by beleaguered rap mogul Sean Diddy Combs.Jamie laughed off the intimation.He responded: The internet said Puffy tried to kill me. Hell no, I left those parties early. Something dont look right, its slippery in here.In his routine, which, at times, veered into a diary session, Jamie revealed how he refused to believe what happened to him. He didnt want to acknowledge that he couldnt walk or that he needed personal care.He also unpacked how the experience led him to reconnect with God, bond with his family and humbled him.There was a very touching moment when he brought his shy youngest daughter Annelise onto the stage after sharing how she snuck into his room and started playing her guitar, which helped stabilise his vitals.At the time, it was all over the place and the staff were unsure of how they could get it down.He called her strumming his spiritual defibrillator.Their short duet on stage left the audience fighting back the tears as it came to light that she was determined to have her father pull through so they could play again.Jamie also added that he was so blessed to be able to walk Corinne down the aisle a few months back.While there were solemn moments on the show, Jamie offset the heaviness with jokes about Dave Chappelle, Jay-Z as well as some of the staff who took care of him  one of whom was the one that saw his pickle while in rehab.He also recalled getting a hug from Halle Berry and what it meant to him. Of course, he milked the humour out of their interaction as only he could.And he also made it very clear that he was not going to be dating white women again. Not sure if Katie Holmes got the memo.Jamie also flexed his powerful vocals with a playful song.This comedy special was Jamie setting the record straight, acknowledging the journey and lessons he learned while also reminding the audience of his legacy in the industry.He added: I never let go of my sense of humour. If I can stay funny, I can stay alive.Ultimately, this comedy special is also a celebration of life. Its got humour, heartfelt emotion and raw honesty.\n\nOf course, there was no better vehicle to share his story than through comedy  his bedrock in the industry.\n\nHis Netflix special, What Had Happened Was, saw the award-winning actor, who is also a revered singer, unpack his journey to fans in Atlanta.Interestingly, he was filming Back in Action with Cameron Diaz around the time that the life-changing incident happened.At the time, his protective eldest daughter Corinne Foxx clamped down on paparazzi by stating that he was hospitalised for a medical complication.Of course, it was only fitting that Corinne introduced her beloved dad on stage for the show.Counting his blessing, he said: Im happy to be alive.What made it more special was that his life was saved by a white doctor wearing a Lakers jersey.He admitted: It is a mystery, we still dont know exactly what happened to me.
