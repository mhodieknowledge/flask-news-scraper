            "content": "BBC\n\nA palliative care nurse in Germany has been sentenced to life in prison after he was convicted of the murder of 10 patients and the attempted murder of 27 others.\n\nProsecutors alleged that the man, who has not been publicly named, injected his mostly elderly patients with painkillers or sedatives in an effort to ease his workload during shifts overnight.\n\nThe offences were committed between December 2023 and May 2024 in a hospital in Wuerselen, in western Germany.\n\nInvestigators are reported to be looking into several other suspicious cases during his career.\n\nAccording to media outlet Agence France-Presse (AFP), the unnamed man had been employed at the hospital in Wuerselen since 2020, after completing training as a nursing professional in 2007.\n\nProsecutors told a court in Aachen that he showed irritation and a lack of empathy to patients who required a higher level of care, and accused him of playing master of life and death.\n\nThe court was told that he injected patients with large doses of morphine and midazolam, a type of sedative, in an effort to reduce his workload during night shifts.\n\nHe was arrested in 2024.\n\nWhen issuing the life sentence, the court said that the mans crimes carried a particular severity of guilt which should bar him from early release after 15 years.\n\nHe will be able to appeal the verdict.\n\nProsecutors have told AFP that exhumations are taking place to identify further potential victims, which could see the man put on trial again.\n\nThe case bears similarityto that of former nurse Niels Hgel, who was handed a life sentence in 2019 after he was convicted of murdering 85 patients at two hospitals in northern Germany.\n\nA court found that he administered lethal doses of heart medication to people in his care between 1999 and 2005.\n\nHe is believed to be the most prolific killer in Germanys modern history.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) says Zimbabwes economy remains highly dollarised, with any de-dollarisation policies needing gradual implementation while the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries has called for further disinflation strategies into 2026 to correct pricing and manage stubbornly high inflation.\n\nZimbabwe is pushing for an end to the use of US Dollars across the economy by 2030, coinciding with a possible two year extension of President Emmerson Mnangagwas rule originally scheduled to end in 2028. Mnangagwas party, Zanu PF party has resolved to extend the Zimbabwean leaders tenure and to end dollarisation by 2030.\n\nHowever, the IMF has said in an interview that Zimbabwe remains highly dollarized with any confidence in a local currency needing to be built through credible fiscal and monetary policies, a strengthened FX market, and the absence of quasi-fiscal operations such as providing subsidies or financing government programsoutside of the budgetframework.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) local currency Zimbabwe says is backed by foreign currency reserves is largely shunned by locals for transactions. The IMF said Zimbabwe has to ringfence any de-dollarisation efforts by a stable policy environment that will accrue confidence for the local unit of exchange.\n\nConfidence in macro-economic policy and the currency is reinforced by a predictable, rules-based policy environment and progress on economic governance.Advancing these reformsalongside clear, consistent economic policy implementationwould help anchor expectations and bolster confidence, the IMFs chief of mission to Zimbabwe,Wojciech Stanislaw Maliszewski, said by email.\n\nThe Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) has called for further disinflation strategies over the next few months. It argued that inflation should be lowered further.\n\nAn inflation rate of 30% is still too high, calling for more disinflation strategies into 2026.The policy target is to have an annual ZiG inflation of 30% by December 2025, said Cornelius Dube, chief economist for the CZI.\n\nAccording to the IMF, theReserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ)has been tighteningits policy stancesince September last year afterhalting monetary financing. This had helpedtolower inflationfrom elevated highs while also easingexchange-rate pressures.\n\nThe gap between official and parallel market rates narrowed, and ZiG inflation declined by mid-2025, though the economy remains highly dollarized, said Maliszewski.\n\nFor the month of October, Zimbabwes inflation in ZiG local currency dropped to32.7%aftershedding 50 percentage points from a rate of 82.7% in the month of September 2025. on the other hand, the USD month-on-month inflation for October 2025 increased to 0.3% from a rate of 0% in the month of September2025.11.4\n\nThe CZI has explained that thismeansthatprices in USD terms remained stable as the observed increase is minimal.\n\nHowever, CZI believes that when the de-dollarisation programme gets rolled out, the inflation differential between ZiG and USD will matter in the decision of which currency to usein transactions.\n\nUSD price stability would make the USD attractive as both a transaction and savings currency. ZiG stability has to be sustainable for a very long time before it can also be considered a close substitute to the USD, said Dube.\n\nThis comes as ZimbabwesUSD year-on-year inflationhas continued on adeclining trend which started in July 2025.\n\nIn October 2025,ZimbabwesUSD inflation declined to 13% fromthe13.4% registered in the month of September. However, a 13% USD inflation is still very high, as it means that savings in USD lost about 13% purchasing power between October 2024 and October 2025, said the CZI.\n\nWith the USD being the main savings currency, it is critical for its inflation to remain very low if savings are to be protected.\n\n",

Unfortunately, after a rise in visitor numbers and repeated vandalism attempts, including people trying to push it over or deface it, access had to be restricted, said Mangwana in a post on X.\n\nHe added that government is now working on measures to reopen access to the statue.\n\nTo enable safe public viewing of the Mbuya Nehanda statue, while protecting the iconic monument, the government is creating a new access framework. The President has instructed that this be implemented as soon as possible. We take this opportunity to apologize to the public for the delayed access, he said.\n\nMangwanas response follows criticism after international travel vlogger Davud Akhundzada was denied access to the statue during a recent visit.\n\nAuthorities came under fire for missing an opportunity to market Zimbabwes capital city.\n\nIn a statement, the Ministry of Tourism and Hospitality Industry distanced itself from the incident, saying responsibility for the monument lies with the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage.\n\nWe wish to clarify that the Mbuya Nehanda Statue is a National Heritage Monument managed by the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage. It stands as a proud symbol of Zimbabwes liberation history and identity.\n\nThe site is subject to specific preservation and security protocols and as such, public access to certain areas, including elevated or restricted zones, may be limited for safety, preservation and security reasons.\n\nHowever, as the Ministry of Tourism and Hospitality Industry, we are taking proactive steps to enhance tourist management at such sites. Through a Whole-of-Government Approach Strategy, in coordination with our counterparts at the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage, we are in the process of deploying tourism officers at key heritage and cultural monuments. These officers will facilitate seamless, well-informed and welcoming access for tourists, ensuring a positive experience while safeguarding our national heritage, read the statement.\n\n",

The approach involves maintaining a high bank policy rate, currently at 35%,to curb speculative borrowing, which has been a major driver of excess liquidity and illicit parallel market activity.\n\nTo this end, the exchange rate premium has remained stable for a period in excess of one year, which has seen annual inflation receding by more than 50% to 32,7%.\n\nSpeaking to parliamentarians in Bulawayo Wednesday, Ncube said the local unit is poised to strengthen further as the year comes to an end.\n\nFourth quarter taxes are expected to increase demand for ZiG, and the appreciation of the exchange rate. In the outlook, exchange rate stability is envisaged, underpinned by the broad acceptance of the ZiG and the continued implementation of prudent fiscal and monetary policies by the Government, Ncube said.\n\nHe attributed the obtaining stability, which has seen the exchange rate maintaining a premium of US$1: ZWG 26.68 to the aggressive policies employed to ring fence the currency.\n\nThe parallel market exchange rate premium has remained stable, falling to below 25% in August 2025, aligning with other countries, including Kenya and Zambia, he said.\n\nNcube said the strategy for accelerated building of foreign currency reserves is bearing fruit following the introduction of the ZiG, which has seen total foreign currency reserves increasing from below US$300 million in April 2024 to over US$900 million by September 2025, targeting US$1 billion by December 2025.\n\nZimbabwe is accumulating both gold and USD reserves which are expected to fully cover both ZiG reserve money and deposits.\n\nAdded Ncube, Inflation is projected to average 61.3% in 2025, end the year at 22.8%, and decline to single-digit levels by 2027, supported by continued exchange rate stability and prudent fiscal and monetary policies.\n\n",

The council cited illegal occupation under municipal by-laws.\n\nThe borehole, drilled in 2019 under the Presidential Borehole Scheme, remains the communitys main source of clean water in an area already suffering from severe shortages. No alternative water source has been proposed to replace it.\n\nIn a petition signed by 280 residents and submitted to the mayor on Wednesday, the community urged council to form a special committee to investigate the land allocations and assess how many boreholes would be affected by the planned housing development.\n\nThe Petitioner beseeches the Harare City Council to establish a Special Committee pursuant to Section 100 of the Urban Councils Act (Chapter 29:15), conduct an investigation into the allocation of infill residential stands in Glen View, determine the number of boreholes that will be affected, and provide recommendations to mitigate the water supply issues that may arise from the removal of the boreholes, the petition reads in part.\n\nResidents warned that demolishing the borehole without providing an alternative water source would violate their constitutional right to water and risk triggering another public health crisis in the cholera-prone suburb.\n\nThey also questioned how stands approved in 2024 could overlap with a borehole installed in 2018 and upgraded in 2025, describing the sequence as evidence of poor planning and possible corruption.\n\nAdding to their frustration, residents said individuals allocated the contested stands have already begun bringing building materials to the site, despite the ongoing dispute.\n\nThe petitioners further demanded that the City of Harare convene a public meeting to release documents showing whether the land was properly allocated before the borehole was drilled.\n\n",
