            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nHARARE Mayor, Jacob Mafume, has said the City Council is not remitting funds to Geo Pomona, despite the company taking over the municipalitys refuse collection mandate under controversial circumstances.\n\nGeo Pomona Waste Management is now responsible for garbage collection in Harare under a deal spearheaded by the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works.\n\nAccording to the initial agreement, the City Council was to pay US$40 per tonne to Geo Pomona for waste disposal, raising questions about the usurping of municipal functions by a private company.\n\nHowever, Mafume has disclosed that the local authority is not paying Geo Pomona, with the government instead footing the costs of refuse collection in Harare.\n\nThe City is not paying anything to Geo Pomona. It has not paid anything. The government is the one that is paying. The issue is, I manage the City, and the City is not paying, and my mandate, as we speak, is to manage City affairs, said Mafume.\n\nThe takeover of refuse collection has drawn criticism towards the Harare City Council, which residents accuse of privatising public services, thereby shifting the payment burden onto them.\n\nMafume, who was once opposed to private partnerships but now appears to be warming up to the idea, is actively seeking organisations or individuals to partner with, as the City Council struggles to fulfil its mandate in Harare.\n\nThe HCC has failed to construct and maintain existing infrastructure, leaving it in a state of dilapidation.\n\nHowever, questions have been raised about the councils sincerity in pursuing public-private partnerships, particularly after a fallout last year with Roadport Private Limited, which nearly led to the company being barred from operating long-distance bus terminals.\n\nMafume attempted to downplay the incident as he embarks on a charm offensive to woo potential partners.\n\nWhen you have a dispute with your partner, it does not mean your marriage is not producing fruits. A Roadport was built and is used by thousands of Harare residents. So, if we have a dispute on one or two issues, it does not mean that everything is lost.\n\nThere is a tendency to highlight the problems you would have faced in an agreement while ignoring everything that has been beneficial, said Mafume.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nZANU PF Mbire District Coordinating Committee chairman in Mashonaland Central province, Takesure Chikwamba has been accused of orchestrating the arrest of former Agriculture deputy minister Douglas Karoro on theft charges.\n\nThe move was allegedly driven by revenge after Chikwamba lost the Mbire Constituency to Karoro in the 2018 harmonised elections.\n\nThis came out in court this Thursday when Chikwamba appeared as a State witness against Karoro who is accused of diverting fertilisers that were meant for Mbire district under the Presidential Input Programme.\n\nThe former deputy minister, who is being represented by Admire Rubaya, denies the allegations, describing them as a fabrication by his political rivals, among them Chikwamba, whom he outclassed in the partys primary elections to represent the constituency in parliament.\n\nChikwamba told Regional Magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa that he reported the matter to the police after he received reports from his party subordinates of suspicious movement of fertilisers at GMB Mushumbi.\n\nHe said he was not in Mbire at the time but was at his home in Ruwa when he was informed about the movement of fertilisers at Mushumbi GMB depot heading to Guruve GMB and rushed to the Police Morris Depot to report.\n\nWhen I got information from Nawo Gumbo and Mutukudzi about the fertilisers I got in touch with intelligence officers from the Presidents office. I also made investigations at GMB Guruve, where I was told there was no ammonium nitrate which was said to be going to be exchanged with compound D which had been taken at Mushumbi.\n\nWe expected the compound D would be returned but it was never delivered to the people of Mbire, he said.\n\nThe defence argued that Chikwamba had no locus standi to receive information at GMB and this shows he had a motive to get back at Karoro who had beaten him in elections.\n\nThey argued that in pursuit of his vendetta, Chikwamba rushed to the police despite not having any evidence but just words from his security officers on the ground.\n\nThey added that Chikwamba never called Karoro to inquire about the allegations but rushed to the police as he had the intention to sink him.\n\nYou had ulterior motives; that is why you did not call him to ascertain whether it was true or not. You just concluded he was a thief and rushed to report without even hearing his side of the story, Rubaya argued.\n\nChikwamba responded, saying he went to the police because he had been told a whistleblower whom he could not name was processing documents at GMB to substantiate the allegations against the former legislator.\n\nThe defence insisted the allegations were a fabrication as they were not supported by evidence, adding that the report was not even made where the alleged offence occurred.\n\nThey said Chikwamba ignored his nearest police stations, Ruwa, Mabvuku and Harare Central and instead rushed to CCD, which ordinarily gets reports through referrals.\n\nThis, they said, showed malice and an intention to get back at Karoro because he had a bone to chew with the accused for defeating them in the elections.\n\nYou were determined to be in the new building in Mt Hampden (parliament) that you sought to have him dismissed through baseless allegations. You ignored all the police stations and just rushed to Morris Depot, now Mkushi Depot, Rubaya said.\n\nChikwamba said he was not bitter after losing the election to Karoro but instead he was happy because it was a learning curve and first time to compete, adding that Karoro was just raising it as a defence to the allegations.\n\nHearing continues next Thursday.\n\n",
