Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and I respect that. I may not know the recipe for success, but surely the recipe for demise is trying to please everyone.\n\nThe few who appreciate my art are the most important, and I will continue to work to please them.

The youth service training was established in 2001, following the Nziramasanga Commission Report of 1999, which recommended education of young people to inculcate values of patriotism, discipline, national identity, service, and civic responsibility.\n\nThe hugely unpopular programme was blamed for breeding a militia that propped Zanu PF during electioneering, going about brutalizing opposition activists.\n\nIt was later disbanded under a cloud of suspicion that the then Youth minister was assembling a private army, only to be reintroduced by President Mnangagwa last year.\n\nThe new curriculum infuses national orientation with life skills training and entrepreneurial development.\n\n",
