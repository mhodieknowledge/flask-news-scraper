Hopefully, our explorations of justice in its various forms will also be enhanced, Moyo said.\n\nZHRC Chairperson Jessie Majome also said the collaboration is a public commitment to advance dignity, equality, and freedom by promoting truth, supporting the marginalised.\n\nThis is a public expression of our intention and commitment to working with each other to advance the dignity, equality and freedom of human beings by working with the truth, speaking out and standing for the people who are marginalised.\n\nThis is an indication of our willingness to work together more in strengthening administrative justice and human rights in Zimbabwe for example, exchanging information and referring cases of violations so that we investigate, she added.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nA BID by the former Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor, Gideon Gono to avoid trial in a US$3 million debt case has hit a snag after the High Court overturned the latest application for absolution.Gono, in his personal capacity and as director of his associate companies amongst them Lunar Chickens, was dragged to the court for failing to settle a US$3 million loan owed to a South Africa based firm, ASP Marketing CC.The South African firm, through its lawyers, Chambati, Mataka & Makonese Attorneys said sometime in 2009, Lunar Chickens entered into agreement with the company for the sale of 2, 209, 72 metric tonnes of maize at US$395 per metric tonne.The material terms of the verbal agreement were that the South African based firm would deliver the maize at Gonos New Donnington Farm, which was duly done in December 2009 and May 2010 before he made the payment.However, Gonos Lunar Chickens failed to pay for the maize delivered as per verbal agreement despite demand, instead opting to pay just US$140, 000 in 2011 and 2012 despite the outstanding amount claimed for delivery of both maize and soya beans is US$2, 2 million.In 2023, the High Court dismissed the former exchequers court application for dismissal of the claim on technical grounds, after he sought to block a full trial on the matter citing a number of irregularities in the ASP Marketing CC application. He submitted that ASP Marketing was only due to receive shares in Lunar Chickens for the equivalent amount of the delivered maize and soya beans.The ex-central bank boss said he would not at any material time enter into such an agreement as he argued that the agreement between him and the South African firm was illegal as payment of such a hefty amount in foreign currency outside the country required approval of the RBZ in line with Exchange Control Regulations of which he was the RBZ governor at the time. The exchange control approval, he alleged, was never obtained first from the RBZ, which he was in charge of at the material time.Gono and his associate companies appealed against the High Court judgment at the Supreme Court. The appeal was dismissed with costs, insisting that the matter presented by ASP Marketing CC must be heard on the merits as the preliminary points by Gono and his associate companies had no merit.When the trial commenced again in July 2025 at the High Court before Justice Mafusire, ASP Marketing CC represented by Advocate Fadzai Mahere instructed by Chambati, Mataka and Makonese Attorneys At Law, testified and led evidence but Gono through his lawyers Advocate Sylvester Hashiti, instructed by Tendai Biti Law, to avoid the trial continuing, filed an application for absolution for the instance at the end of the plaintiffs case. They argued that the plaintiff had not led any evidence on any aspect of the plaintiffs claim and that they had not produced any document to prove liability or quantum.However, Gonos application of absolution from instance was dismissed with costs by Justice Mafusire stating in his judgment that, It is perhaps because the application for absolution from the instance was incredibly ridiculous that counsel for the plaintiff objected to its being made in the first place.The judge added, There is no question that the application for absolution from the instance has no merit. It must be a stratagem by the defendants to stall progress of the trial.

If true, that is an abuse of the court process.The ruling has literally left the former RBZ top official in the open, with a full trial set to play out in court.\n\nIn 2023, the High Court dismissed the former exchequers court application for dismissal of the claim on technical grounds, after he sought to block a full trial on the matter citing a number of irregularities in the ASP Marketing CC application. He submitted that ASP Marketing was only due to receive shares in Lunar Chickens for the equivalent amount of the delivered maize and soya beans.\n\nThe ex-central bank boss said he would not at any material time enter into such an agreement as he argued that the agreement between him and the South African firm was illegal as payment of such a hefty amount in foreign currency outside the country required approval of the RBZ in line with Exchange Control Regulations of which he was the RBZ governor at the time. The exchange control approval, he alleged, was never obtained first from the RBZ, which he was in charge of at the material time.Gono and his associate companies appealed against the High Court judgment at the Supreme Court. The appeal was dismissed with costs, insisting that the matter presented by ASP Marketing CC must be heard on the merits as the preliminary points by Gono and his associate companies had no merit.When the trial commenced again in July 2025 at the High Court before Justice Mafusire, ASP Marketing CC represented by Advocate Fadzai Mahere instructed by Chambati, Mataka and Makonese Attorneys At Law, testified and led evidence but Gono through his lawyers Advocate Sylvester Hashiti, instructed by Tendai Biti Law, to avoid the trial continuing, filed an application for absolution for the instance at the end of the plaintiffs case.

These reviews are guided by the need to improve the welfare of educators while maintaining fiscal sustainability, he said.In addition to salary adjustment, Moyo said the government has introduced several non-monetary incentives including provision of land for housing development, duty-free vehicle importation facility, access to the Government Employees Mutual Savings (GEMS) scheme and ongoing efforts to expand institutional accommodation.The ministry continues to engage with relevant stakeholders to explore more innovative ways of cushioning teachers from economic pressures including school-based incentives supported through local communities and responsible authorities, he added.Zimbabwe is one of the few countries, which does not meaningfully reward its teachers and civil servants.A June 2021 report stated that, comparing with other regional countries, Zimbabwean teachers got way below their peers. In Namibia, tutors earned 24,000 Namibian dollars per month, equivalent to about US$1,759 at that time. In Botswana, teachers salaries range from 5,970 to 22,700 Botswana Pula per month while Lesothos average salary in 2024 was around 11,800 Lesotho Loti (LSL) per month, or about $792.\n\nThe third term of 2025 is expected to commence next Tuesday, September 9.\n\nThe countrys educators and the rest of civil servants report taking home US$270 plus local currency, which is way below the realistic cost of living.During a parliamentary session this week, Glen View North legislator, Happymore Chidziva, took Labour and Public Service Minister, Edgar Moyo to task demanding to know what plans are in place to review teachers salaries to meet the poverty datum line and whether there are non-monetary benefits like fuel and housing.In response, Moyo dodged the question, hinting that tough times for teachers are set to persist up to year-end.Our response is that the Government, through the National Joint Negotiating Council (NJNC), is continuously reviewing salaries and conditions of service for teachers and the wider civil service.

Global fashion runways ooze elegance as they are a catalyst for taste, inspiring womens wardrobes each season.Fashionis big business, according toBizplanr,the global fashion industry is currently valued at $1.84 trillion in 2025. It accounts for approximately 1.63% of the worlds GDP and is projected to grow at a 4.1% CAGR between 2024 and 2030. This makes fashion weeks integral to the ecosystem, spotlighting emerging and established talent alike. And Zimbabwe is slowly gaining momentum on that frontier.\n\nConnecting the dots at the helm of Zimbabwe Fashion Week is Priscilla Chigariro, model, interior designer, culinary creative, and, most importantly, cultural strategist. As the founder of the Zimbabwe Fashion Week Trust, she has been shaping the countrys fashion narrative since 2009. This October, she is back to orchestrate what she calls a homecoming, but also a reintroduction.\n\nThis year feels like a homecoming, but also a reintroduction. Were not just picking up where we left off, were coming back with a deeper sense ofpurpose, she says. Hosting the event at the iconic Hyatt Regency Harare (The Meikles) adds a sense of gravitas, a setting worthy of her vision. And her vision is ambitious: a fashion week that bridges Zimbabwean talent with the wider African and diaspora conversation.\n\nPriscilla sees fashion as both a business and a cultural movement. She sees a philosophy that influences everything from the lineup of shows to the conversations on sustainability. Fashion isnt just about the clothes. Its an economic driver, a storytelling medium, and a record of who we are, she explains.\n\nAfrican fashion has long battled with fragmented markets, lack of infrastructure, and limited access to international buyers. Too often, local talent gets trapped in a cycle of underfunded production and exposure limited to regional stages. Yet, within these challenges lie opportunities: a continent brimming with artisanal skill, sustainable textile traditions, and untapped consumer markets.\n\nPriscilla is addressing both ends of the equation. Through her PC Group Fashion Futures Program, she invests in emerging designers, offering mentorship, market access, and practical business skills. The Hunhu Council of Fashion, another of her initiatives, safeguards cultural heritage while promoting innovation. Theyre intertwined, she says. Fashion Futures is about long-term development, while the Hunhu Council protects and promotes African fashion heritage. ZFW is where those two worlds meet on stage.\n\nHer multidisciplinary background shapes ZFW into an experience rather than just an event. From music and staging to how guests are welcomed, every detail is curated to tell a story. My modeling background taught me presentation and detail, my design work taught me storytelling through form, and the culinary world taught me the power of hospitality, she notes.\n\nThis years shows will spotlight small-batch, artisan-led labels alongside contemporary fashion houses ready for international retail. For Priscilla, the thrill lies in the range: The excitement this year is in watching new names step onto a global stage with confidence.\n\nWhile sustainability has become a fashion buzzword, Priscilla grounds it in cultural responsibility. Its about honouring the land, the makers, and the cultural lineage behind the garments, she says. Expect slow fashion showcases, natural fibers, and artisanal techniques to be front and center, all while protecting intellectual property and ensuring that cultural narratives remain intact.\n\nForZimbabweto thrive in the global fashion economy, Priscilla believes international collaboration is essential. We cant grow in isolation. International collaboration brings resources and new perspectives, but it also allows us to share our innovations with the world. Its a two-way exchange. And her message through this revival? We belong on the global stage, and we can take our seat without losing ourselves. Zimbabwe has so much creative wealth, but its often overlooked or underestimated.\n\nAs the lights dim and the first model steps onto the runway, the energy will be electric. Zimbabwe is here, it is relevant, and it is ready for the world.\n\n",
