            "content": "BBC\n\nThe normal soundtrack that accompanies Jamaican life is silent this morning as many have woken to no electricity.\n\nAbout three-quarters of the island is without power and many parts of its western side are under water, with homes destroyed by strong winds after Hurricane Melissa tore across the island with catastrophic force.\n\nAs wind and rain lashed through the night, one local official said the destruction resembled the scene of an apocalypse movie.\n\nWith communications crippled, the true scale of the disaster remains unknown. Prime Minister Andrew Holness declared the island a disaster area late Tuesday, warning of devastating impacts and significant damage to hospitals, homes and businesses.\n\nAlthough no deaths have yet been confirmed, Montego Bays mayor Richard Vernon told the BBC his first task at daybreak would be to check if everybody is alive.\n\nGetty Images Trees had already been uprooted in St. Catherine before the hurricane made landfall\n\nHurricane Melissa, the strongest storm to strike Jamaica in modern history, barrelled across the country on Tuesday, leaving behind a trail of ruin.\n\nAt its peak, the hurricane sustained winds of 298 km/h (185 mph)  stronger than Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans in 2005 and killed 1,392 people.\n\nIt resembled the scene of an apocalypse movie, an MP in western Jamaica told Kingston-based journalist Kimone Francis of The Jamaica Gleaner.\n\nFrancis described the night as stressful and intense, marked by relentless heavy wind and rain.\n\nYou dont have a connection. You cant speak to the people you normally speak to, she told the BBC World Services Newsday programme.\n\nAcross Jamaicas central parishes, Francis said, floodwaters rose to the roofs of two-storey homes.\n\nOne anonymous woman told the BBC: There is water coming in through the roof of my house. I am not okay.\n\nWhile no fatalities had been confirmed, Jamaicas prime minister told CNN he feared there would be some loss of life. Damage, he said, was widespread  hitting hospitals, schools, homes and businesses.\n\nLocal government minister Desmond Mckenzie said on Tuesday afternoon that the southwestern parish of St Elizabeth was under water, with at least three families trapped in their homes in the community of Black River.\n\nRescue teams are struggling to reach them because of the dangerous conditions, he said at a news conference.\n\nVerna Genus was sheltering from the storm at her four bedroom home in the village of Carlisle, St Elizabeth, when the hurricane ripped the zinc roof off her house.\n\nThe 73-year-old vegetable farmer was in the house with her sons and baby grandchild when the hurricane made landfall over the area.\n\nVerna has lost communications due to the power lines being down. But her UK-based sister, June Powell, spoke to the BBC about what happened.\n\nShe was crying on the phone, June said, adding: You are huddled up inside and then you look up then the roof is gone. I have never heard her like that  she was wailing we are all finished.'\n\nShe is anxiously waiting for the communications networks to be restored so she can talk to her sister.\n\nSt Elizabeth, known as Jamaicas breadbasket, produces much of the islands produce. With crops submerged and fields destroyed, many farmers will struggle to financially recover.\n\nOn the north coast, Montego Bay  the heart of Jamaicas tourism industry and home to its main airport  will also take time to get back on its feet. This hurricane has put a hand around the neck of the Jamaican economy.\n\nMontego city was split in two by floodwaters, Mayor Vernon said. He told BBC Breakfast: Once the wind subsided, we started to get a lot of heavy rain and that has led to massive floods right across the city. One side of the city is now cut off from the other due to roads being inundated by flood water.\n\nHis immediate concern, he added, was simple: Check if everybody is alive.\n\nIn rural Jamaica, the storm has left people shaken. Tamisha Lee, president of the Jamaica Network of Rural Women Producers, said: Right now, what Im seeing is heavy rain, powerful wind, a lot of things flying all over the place, and trees uprooted. There is no electricity. I am feeling anxious and tense. The damage will be enormous.\n\nMeteorologists said Hurricane Melissa intensified at a speed rarely seen, its rapid strengthening fuelled by abnormally warm Caribbean waters  part of a broader trend linked to climate change.\n\nBy the time it struck Jamaica, the storm had reached Category 5 strength, with gusts fierce enough to tear roofs from concrete homes, uproot trees and snap power poles.\n\nHealth officials even issued a crocodile warning, cautioning that floodwaters could drive the reptiles into residential areas.\n\nFor thousands of tourists caught on the island, the storm brought terror and uncertainty.\n\nIve never heard anything like it, said Pia Chevallier from Cambridge, who travelled to Jamaica with her 15-year-old son on Saturday.\n\nSpeaking to BBC Radio 5 Live from her darkened hotel room, she said: The glass in the windows and patio doors was all vibrating. The doors sounded like they were slamming, even though they were closed. It was horrendous.\n\nShe added: Theres debris everywhere  palm trees, coconuts, branches, all over the place. The big palm trees with all the roots are up. Thats how strong the winds have been.\n\nOn the north coast, Wayne Gibson, a British tourist from Kent holidaying in Ocho Rios with his wife and two teenage daughters, told BBC Radio 4s Today programme that they were sheltering in a communal hall.\n\nKyle Holmes from Bolton, visiting Lucea in the north west, described the hotel as a disaster zone and said he had no idea when they will be able to get home.\n\nHurricane Melissa had moved on to make landfall in Cuba by early Wednesday morning, leaving Jamaica paralysed and silent. Though it has since weakened to a Category 3 hurricane, it remains powerful with wind speeds of over 200km/h (124mph).\n\nJamaica has a catastrophe bond  a type of insurance for the country  which will hopefully allow people to get back on their feet, but the issue is whats done in the interim.\n\n",

I am banned, he said on Tuesday.\n\nSoyinka has long been critical of the Trump administrations radical stance on immigration and linked the visa revocation to his outspoken criticism.\n\nHe said his recent comparison of Trump to Ugandas dictator  Idi Amin in white face  may have contributed to the current situation.\n\nWhen I called Donald Trump Idi Amin, I thought I was paying him a compliment, Soyinka said, hes been behaving like a dictator.\n\nIdi Amin was a Ugandan military officer and dictator who ruled the country from 1971 to 1979, infamous for his brutal regime and widespread human rights abuses.\n\nWhen asked if he would consider going back to the US, Soyinka said: How old am I?\n\nIn July, the US State Department announced sweeping changes to its non-immigrant visa policy for citizens of Nigeria and several other African countries.\n\nAccording to the policy, nearly all non-immigrant and non-diplomatic visas issued to Nigerians and nationals of Cameroon, Ethiopia and Ghana would now be single-entry and valid for only three months, rolling back the up to five-year, multiple-entry visas they had enjoyed previously.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa on Tuesday praised the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwes (RBZ) tight monetary policy stance, describing it as favourable for sustaining economic activity and maintaining stability in the economy.\n\nSince taking over as RBZ Governor last year, Dr. John Mushayavanhu has implemented a restrictive monetary policy aimed at anchoring price, currency, and exchange rate stability. The approach involves maintaining a high bank policy rate, currently at 35%,to curb speculative borrowing, which has been a major driver of excess liquidity and illicit parallel market activity.\n\nOther measures, such as elevated reserve requirements, have also been introduced to control inflation while supporting long-term economic growth.\n\nAs a result, the policy has helped sustain the ZWG currency, which has enjoyed nearly a year of relative stability, encouraging broader acceptance and usage.\n\nPresenting the State of the Nation Address (SONA), Mnangagwa credited the RBZs monetary discipline for fostering a favourable economic environment.\n\nThe tight monetary and fiscal environment in the economy has remained favourable to support sustained economic activity. My Government is diligently implementing the necessary policies, measures, and initiatives to maintain the stability of the ZWG and inflation, he said.\n\nThe President added that the ongoing trend of macroeconomic stability is expected to become a permanent feature of Zimbabwes economy.\n\nHe also highlighted significant progress in the countrys foreign currency generation capacity.\n\nInflows stood at US$10.4 billion as of August 2025, an increase of 26.8% from the US$8.3 billion recorded during the same period in 2024. Consequently, foreign currency reserves rose to about US$900 million by the end of September 2025, up from US$700 million in June 2025.\n\nIn recognition of this progress, the World Bank recently ranked Zimbabwe first among the top 10 countries globally that have made significant gains in foreign currency reserve accumulation. On the fiscal front, I am pleased to advise that we remain steadfast in strengthening sustainable resource mobilisation strategies to ensure the continued provision of public services, Mnangagwa added.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa on Tuesday reaffirmed his governments commitment to finalising the Mines and Minerals Bill during the current session of Parliament.\n\nThe government gazetted the Bill in June this year, bringing relief to communities that have long endured hardships caused by mining-related activities.\n\nAmong other provisions, the Bill seeks to replace the Mines and Minerals Act (Chapter 21:05) of 1961, establish a Mining Affairs Board to guide decision-making processes, and introduce clearer rules on the management of mining titles, particularly with regard to the cadastre system and exploration rights.\n\nOnce enacted, the legislation is expected to strengthen environmental compliance and land rehabilitation obligations, enhance governance through transparency and accountability mechanisms in the allocation of mining rights, and define and protect community rights, including benefit-sharing and land access protocols.\n\nResponding to long-standing calls from organisations such as Silveira House, which has worked tirelessly to promote human rights in mining communities, Mnangagwa reassured the nation of the Bills expeditious finalisation.\n\nThe Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill has been gazetted and is expected to be finalised during the current session of Parliament. My Government is committed to weeding out irresponsible mining stakeholders who cause pollution, environmental degradation, and damage to critical infrastructure.\n\nAs we welcome investors into our jurisdiction, we expect them to adhere to the Constitution and laws of our country, while also respecting our people, customs, and culture, he said.\n\nHowever, citizens have urged the government to make the Mines and Minerals Bill available in vernacular languages to ensure easier understanding and interpretation, especially within mining communities.\n\n",
