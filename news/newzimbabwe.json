            "content": "Reuters\n\nZimbabwes gold-backed currency now has more than 100% reserve cover and is stable, according to the central bank, but doubts over its credibility remain, underscored by a persistent premium in the parallel market.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe on Monday kept its benchmark rate unchanged at 35%, citing a stable exchange rate as one of the reasons, and reported total reserves of $701 million. The bank said the portion of transactions carried out using the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency surged to 43% in May from 26% in April 2024, the month it was introduced.\n\nDecades of economic instability and currency devaluations mean most people still use the United States Dollar for most purchases. But the authorities are hoping the ZiGs gold backing will give Zimbabweans the confidence to adopt it for everyday transactions.\n\nZiG is our national currency, and as the central bank, we are committed to ensuring its success by maintaining all the fundamental characteristics of sound money, including its function as a reliable store of value, Reserve Bank Governor John Mushayavanhu wrote in response to Reuters questions.\n\nThe Reserve Bank has learned from previous currency failures that maintaining optimum money supply and ensuring monetary stability is vital, he added.\n\nDespite the banks assurances, the gap between the official exchange rate and parallel market rate remains about 20%.\n\nThe rate has been stable for more than three months, said Black-Market Trader Pearson Tambudze, attributing the stability to a scarcity of the local currency rather than restored confidence.There isnt a lot of ZiG in the market, he said.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund has welcomed the ZiGs stability but is urging Zimbabwe to adopt tighter money-growth limits, a more transparent foreign exchange market and to make progress on clearing an estimated $12.2 billion in external arrears.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nPRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwas spokesperson George Charamba, has acknowledged the dire state of Zimbabwes public hospitals, highlighting infrastructure decay, policy gaps and systematic overload.\n\nCharamba was speaking following Mnangagwas visit to Zimbabwes main referral hospitals, Parirenyatwa and Sally Mugabe, on Monday. The visits follow public outcry over the dysfunctional state of public hospitals.\n\nMnangagwas government has long neglected general hospitals, which now face crumbling infrastructure, medicine shortages, costly patient care and poor wages that have led to low staff morale and a massive brain drain.\n\nOur role as Presidential staffers was to note areas requiring immediate, medium and long-term interventions, and they were just too many, in order to help shape effective health delivery policy.\n\nIt was clear from the visit that the whole health delivery hierarchy needed attention. Failures at basic primary levels like clinics, municipal clinics and district hospitals transmitted themselves all the way to referral hospitals, leading to a system which is creaking from an overload, disrepair and fresh investments.\n\nInterventions have got to be systemic, a lack which in fact explains the rise of top-notch private care-givers who are a ringing antipode to massive failures in the public health system, Charamba wrote on his X account.\n\nZimbabwes referral hospitals are overloaded and overwhelmed, as most primary care clinics are incapacitated and unable to handle even basic health issues.\n\nThe presidential spokesmanalso said Mnangagwa witnessed the Parirenyatwa Hospitals Mbuya NehandaMaternity Wing operating without curtains or heating, compromising patient privacy and comfort.\n\nMany wards do not have enough blankets, and most have broken windows.\n\nCharamba added thatthere are serious administrative inefficiencies across the Ministries of Finance, Local Government, and Health that urgently require a more hands-on approach.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nUgandas President Yoweri Museveni has signed into law an amendment that will allow, once again, civilians to be tried in a military court under certain circumstances.\n\nA previous law permitting such trials was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in January.\n\nBefore that ruling,civilians could be taken to a military tribunal if they had been found with military equipmentlike guns or army uniforms. Activists had complained that the law was used to persecute government critics.\n\nParliamentarians passed the amendment last month amid a heavy police presence and a boycott by opposition lawmakers, who argued that it violated the ruling by the countrys highest court.\n\nIn January, the judges said that the military courts were neither impartial nor competent to exercise judicial functions, the International Society for Human Rights reported at the time.\n\nThe amendment appears to try and address some of the issues.\n\nIt says that those presiding over the tribunals should have relevant legal qualifications and training. It also says that while performing their legal functions they should be independent and impartial.\n\nBut civilians can still be transferred if found with military hardware.\n\nThe law will deal decisively with armed violent criminals, deter the formation of militant political groups that seek to subvert democratic processes, and ensure national security is bound on a firm foundational base. If it aint broke, dont fix it!, army spokespersonCol Chris Magezi wrote on X after the bill was passed by MPs.\n\nBut opposition leader Bobi Wine said the law would be used against him and others.\n\nAll of us in the opposition are being targeted by the act, he told the AFP news agency.\n\nThe Uganda Law Society, a professional body that represents the countrys lawyers, has said it will challenge the constitutionality of the amendment.\n\nFor years, activists had argued that the military courts were being used by the government to silence dissidents, with people alleging that evidence had been planted.\n\nIf you are a political opponent then they will find a way of getting you under the military court and then you know your fate is sealed once there, justice will never visit your door, human rights lawyer Gawaya Tegulle told the BBCs Focus on Africa podcast in February.\n\nHe added that people can spend years in detention on remand as the courts await decisions from senior military figures, which may never come, and those who are tried and found guilty face harsher penalties than in civilian courts.\n\nA recent high-profile case followed Novembers arrest of long-time leading opposition figure Kizza Besigye. He was picked up in neighbouring Kenya, taken across the border and then charged in a military court with possession of pistols and attempting to purchase weapons abroad, which he denied.\n\nThose charges were dropped, and replaced with others, when his case was transferred to a civilian court following the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nMuseveni, who has been in power since 1986,described the verdict as the wrong decision, adding that the country is not governed by the judges. It is governed by the people.\n\nHe hadpreviously defended the use of military courtssaying that they dealt with the rampant activities of criminals and terrorists that were using guns to kill people indiscriminately.\n\nHe said that civilian courts were too busy to handle these gun-wielding criminals quickly.\n\n",
