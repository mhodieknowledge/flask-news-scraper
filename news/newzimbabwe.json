            "content": "IOL Business\n\nUS President Donald Trump has threatened an additional 10% tariff on any country aligning with the BRICS nations policies, which could have severe implications for South Africa.\n\nAny country aligning themselves with the Anti-American policies of BRICS will be charged an ADDITIONAL 10% Tariff. There will be no exceptions to this policy, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform on Sunday night.\n\nThis levy would be implemented over and above the base 10% tariff that is already being planned for all of the countrys global trade partners.\n\nThe new tariff threat was in direct response to criticisms of Trumps unilateral tariff measures, made by BRICS members during a summit held in Rio de Janeiro on Sunday. A joint BRICS statement released after the summit said the upcoming tariffs risked hurting the global economy.\n\nAt the event, BRICS leaders also collectively condemned the recent Israeli and US air strikes on Iran, expressing serious concern over deliberate attacks on civilian infrastructure and peaceful nuclear facilities, and labelling the strikes a violation of international law.\n\nTrumps new threats come at the beginning of a crucial week for the global economy as the US Presidents July 9 tariff deadline looms. While the White House is expected to start sending out letters to its trade partners this week, outlining the new tariffs, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed during a press conference over the weekend that the new tariffs will now take effect from August 1.\n\nThe sweeping global tariffs were originally planned for April 1, but Trump announced a three-month delay after global markets reacted negatively to the looming trade war.\n\nSouth Africa has requested an extension of the 90-day tariff pause, after the US announced its intention to introduce a new trade template for countries in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nThe US President said he would impose unilateral levies on trade partners unless a deal could be struck by August 1, AFP reported.\n\nSouth Africa stands to lose billions in export revenue should the country face higher tariffs from the US, as well as the potential loss of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which provides duty-free access to that market. SA exports under AGOA amounted to $3.6 billion (R64bn) in 2022.\n\nThe agricultural and automotive sectors could be particularly hard hit. Although in the latter case only BMW and Mercedes export cars from South Africa to the US, these volumes are significant enough to make it the countrys third biggest auto export destination.\n\nBRICS, consisting of 11 emerging nations, including Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, along with more recent entrants such as Iran, accounts for about half of the worlds population and 40% of global economic output.\n\n",

            "content": "By Farai Mutsaka l AP\n\nAny gold in there today? Ezekiel Mabhiza called to a man hunched over a mound of trash, hoe in hand, rummaging through one of the many illegal dumpsites that scar Zimbabwes capital.\n\nMabhiza joined in. For the next several hours, he scoured the sites around Harare, using a stick or his bare hands to sift through piles of filth, from discarded diapers to broken appliances. By midday, his pushcart was full. Springs from old mattresses, car parts, tin cans  it all added up to 66 kilograms (145 pounds) of salvaged metal.The haul earned him $8. Its enough to feed his five children for the day, maybe even cover a utility bill in a country where the majority of people survive through informal work.I have given up looking for a formal job, the 36-year-old said.You walk the industrial areas all day and come back with nothing. This is my job now. I pay rent, my children eat and go to school.Across Harare, thousands like Mabhiza live off scrap metal. Quietly, they are helping to sustain a cleaner environment and combat climate change.Making steel relies heavily on burning highly polluting coal, and the industry accounts for nearly 8% of the carbon dioxide emissions that come from the energy sector and contribute to Earths warming, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD.It takes less energy to turn scrap metal into new steel, so the pickers are helping reduce carbon emissions with their work in addition to cleaning up metals that would otherwise pollute the city.1,000 tons of waste per dayHarare generates about 1,000 tons of waste every day, most of which goes uncollected, according to the city council. People and companies frustrated with erratic collection dump trash on roadsides and open spaces. They sometimes burn it. Once-pristine neighborhoods have become polluted eyesores.Recently, the city council partnered with a green energy waste management company to improve collection amid contested accusations of corruption. But for now, informal pickers like Mabhiza remain indispensable.Its a dirty job, yes, but people rarely understand how important it is, said Fungai Mataga, who runs a scrap metal collection center where Mabhiza and others sell their finds.They are societys cleaning crew. Every piece of metal they bring here is one less item polluting our land.Globally, this kind of scrap metal is vital to the steel industry, accounting for roughly a third of metallic raw materials used in steel production, according to the OECD.With growing concerns over the environmental impact of mining and rising interest in circular economies, demand for recycled materials is increasing.Informal pickers are the unsung heroes, said Joyce Machiri, head of the mining and extractives program at the Zimbabwe Environmental Lawyers Association.When you look at scrap, no one would actually say, Wow, this a good job. But look at it this way, these are some of the green jobs we are talking about, Machiri said.Recycled metal is key for the steel industryMany steelmakers cannot afford to invest in new, cleaner technologies. That makes scrap recycling a critical  and accessible  alternative.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that recycling steel and tin cans saves 60% to 74% of the energy required to produce them from raw materials.Although there are no official statistics on the number of scrap metal collectors in Zimbabwe due to the informal nature of their work, they are unmistakable.In Hopley, a poor township in Harare, they streamed into a dusty open lot where they sell their scrap. Some pushed carts. Others carried sacks on their heads. One woman brought a small plastic bag with just enough metal to earn a few cents to buy vegetables for dinner.Inside the yard, heaps of junk like old fridges, microwaves, cups, water heater tanks, generators and car engines were weighed on a giant old scale. Workers handed out cash and loaded the metal onto a 30-ton truck destined for a steelmaker that will buy it for between $220 and $260 a ton.Factories in the southern African country of 16 million people consume about 600,000 tons of scrap metal annually, all locally collected, said Dosman Mangisi, chief operations officer of the Zimbabwe Institute of Foundries, an association of metal casting businesses.Tough and dangerous job: I hope I can afford gloves one dayThe job of hunting scrap metal is grueling and hazardous. Hunters rise before dawn, walking kilometers to scavenge from landfills, industrial zones, homes and roadside dumps. Some sleep near illegal dumpsites, waiting for trucks that unload waste overnight to avoid arrest.I have been lucky not to fall sick, said Lovemore Sibanda, a security guard who collects scrap on his days off.But I am always worried. I hope I can afford gloves one day.Metal hunters such as Mabhiza and Sibanda have seen it all, from medical waste such as syringes and expired medicines to rotting carcasses of pets such as dogs and cats thrown away by their owners.At first, I would lose my appetite for days after seeing things like that, said Sibanda. Now, I am used to it. This is my office. This is where the money is.\n\nMabhiza joined in.

Every piece of metal they bring here is one less item polluting our land.Globally, this kind of scrap metal is vital to the steel industry, accounting for roughly a third of metallic raw materials used in steel production, according to the OECD.With growing concerns over the environmental impact of mining and rising interest in circular economies, demand for recycled materials is increasing.Informal pickers are the unsung heroes, said Joyce Machiri, head of the mining and extractives program at the Zimbabwe Environmental Lawyers Association.When you look at scrap, no one would actually say, Wow, this a good job. But look at it this way, these are some of the green jobs we are talking about, Machiri said.Recycled metal is key for the steel industryMany steelmakers cannot afford to invest in new, cleaner technologies. That makes scrap recycling a critical  and accessible  alternative.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that recycling steel and tin cans saves 60% to 74% of the energy required to produce them from raw materials.Although there are no official statistics on the number of scrap metal collectors in Zimbabwe due to the informal nature of their work, they are unmistakable.In Hopley, a poor township in Harare, they streamed into a dusty open lot where they sell their scrap. Some pushed carts. Others carried sacks on their heads. One woman brought a small plastic bag with just enough metal to earn a few cents to buy vegetables for dinner.Inside the yard, heaps of junk like old fridges, microwaves, cups, water heater tanks, generators and car engines were weighed on a giant old scale. Workers handed out cash and loaded the metal onto a 30-ton truck destined for a steelmaker that will buy it for between $220 and $260 a ton.Factories in the southern African country of 16 million people consume about 600,000 tons of scrap metal annually, all locally collected, said Dosman Mangisi, chief operations officer of the Zimbabwe Institute of Foundries, an association of metal casting businesses.Tough and dangerous job: I hope I can afford gloves one dayThe job of hunting scrap metal is grueling and hazardous. Hunters rise before dawn, walking kilometers to scavenge from landfills, industrial zones, homes and roadside dumps. Some sleep near illegal dumpsites, waiting for trucks that unload waste overnight to avoid arrest.I have been lucky not to fall sick, said Lovemore Sibanda, a security guard who collects scrap on his days off.But I am always worried. I hope I can afford gloves one day.Metal hunters such as Mabhiza and Sibanda have seen it all, from medical waste such as syringes and expired medicines to rotting carcasses of pets such as dogs and cats thrown away by their owners.At first, I would lose my appetite for days after seeing things like that, said Sibanda. Now, I am used to it. This is my office. This is where the money is.\n\nThe haul earned him $8. Its enough to feed his five children for the day, maybe even cover a utility bill in a country where the majority of people survive through informal work.\n\nI have given up looking for a formal job, the 36-year-old said.You walk the industrial areas all day and come back with nothing. This is my job now. I pay rent, my children eat and go to school.Across Harare, thousands like Mabhiza live off scrap metal. Quietly, they are helping to sustain a cleaner environment and combat climate change.Making steel relies heavily on burning highly polluting coal, and the industry accounts for nearly 8% of the carbon dioxide emissions that come from the energy sector and contribute to Earths warming, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD.It takes less energy to turn scrap metal into new steel, so the pickers are helping reduce carbon emissions with their work in addition to cleaning up metals that would otherwise pollute the city.1,000 tons of waste per dayHarare generates about 1,000 tons of waste every day, most of which goes uncollected, according to the city council.

Workers handed out cash and loaded the metal onto a 30-ton truck destined for a steelmaker that will buy it for between $220 and $260 a ton.Factories in the southern African country of 16 million people consume about 600,000 tons of scrap metal annually, all locally collected, said Dosman Mangisi, chief operations officer of the Zimbabwe Institute of Foundries, an association of metal casting businesses.Tough and dangerous job: I hope I can afford gloves one dayThe job of hunting scrap metal is grueling and hazardous. Hunters rise before dawn, walking kilometers to scavenge from landfills, industrial zones, homes and roadside dumps. Some sleep near illegal dumpsites, waiting for trucks that unload waste overnight to avoid arrest.I have been lucky not to fall sick, said Lovemore Sibanda, a security guard who collects scrap on his days off.But I am always worried. I hope I can afford gloves one day.Metal hunters such as Mabhiza and Sibanda have seen it all, from medical waste such as syringes and expired medicines to rotting carcasses of pets such as dogs and cats thrown away by their owners.At first, I would lose my appetite for days after seeing things like that, said Sibanda. Now, I am used to it. This is my office. This is where the money is.\n\nThey are societys cleaning crew. Every piece of metal they bring here is one less item polluting our land.\n\nGlobally, this kind of scrap metal is vital to the steel industry, accounting for roughly a third of metallic raw materials used in steel production, according to the OECD.With growing concerns over the environmental impact of mining and rising interest in circular economies, demand for recycled materials is increasing.Informal pickers are the unsung heroes, said Joyce Machiri, head of the mining and extractives program at the Zimbabwe Environmental Lawyers Association.When you look at scrap, no one would actually say, Wow, this a good job. But look at it this way, these are some of the green jobs we are talking about, Machiri said.Recycled metal is key for the steel industryMany steelmakers cannot afford to invest in new, cleaner technologies. That makes scrap recycling a critical  and accessible  alternative.The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that recycling steel and tin cans saves 60% to 74% of the energy required to produce them from raw materials.Although there are no official statistics on the number of scrap metal collectors in Zimbabwe due to the informal nature of their work, they are unmistakable.In Hopley, a poor township in Harare, they streamed into a dusty open lot where they sell their scrap.

The mining and quarrying sector showed the highest growth rate of 12,9%, contributing 14,3% to the economy. The wholesale and retail trade sector came in third, contributing 11,8% following a 2,6% growth rate.The modest growth in GDP came amid ongoing efforts by the government to stabilise the macroeconomic environment, support value-added industries, and improve export competitiveness.However, the impact of climate change on agriculture and challenges in infrastructure and energy supply continued to pose risks to sustained growth.According to a report issued by the World Bank in April 2025, Zimbabwes decline in economic growth in 2024 was primarily driven by the El Nio-induced drought.The drought led to steep decline in agricultural output and rising food prices, while hydroelectric power shortages constrained manufacturing. A recovery of 6% growth is expected in 2025, driven by agricultural recovery, investments in mining and steel production, and moderated inflation, the report read.The African Development Bank stated in its Country Focus Report (2 July 2025) that poverty remained widespread in Zimbabwe, with an estimated 57% of the population living below the poverty line in 2024. Unemployment stood at 21,8% in 2024.\n\nIt is reported that the agriculture, forestry and fishing sector contracted by a steep 18.12%, mainly due to the El Nio-induced drought.\n\nThe El Nio-induced drought in 2024 severely impacted Zimbabwes agricultural sector, which saw its contribution to GDP fall to 8,7%, down from 11,5% the previous year.Its contribution to GDP dropped sharply to 8,7% in 2024, down from 11,5% in the previous year.The manufacturing sector topped the list of sectoral contributors to GDP, accounting for 15,6%, a slight increase from 15,3% in 2023.
