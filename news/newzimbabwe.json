It will be decentralised in all our central hospitals, as you are aware that all our central hospitals have specialists who can perform these surgeries.\n\nWhat is now hindering them is the modern equipment to use for that, but definitely with time, we are going to make sure that it is going to be done to our locals and to our people for free, said Kwidi.\n\nThe lack of medical equipment in major public hospitals has left many citizens to seek treatment outside the country.\n\nHowever, the poor who cannot afford specialised treatment in foreign countries and private medical facilities have to contend with the dire services in public hospitals.\n\nKwidini made a bold assertion that the government is addressing the countrys healthcare systems.\n\nWith that, as per our policy, we want to make sure that these trained specialist doctors locally are going to be capacitated, especially with the tools of trade.\n\nThat is why we have seen now that our President has moved to the mantra to say, let us renovate our health institutions into the modern systems to ensure that we are able to do the specialised treatment which people are seeking on these major operations, especially in India and other countries, said Kwidini.\n\n",

Therefore, we are looking forward to having more doctors in 2029 to 2030 to service these rural hospitals, said Kwidini.\n\nThis has left citizens in rural areas in a quandary, forcing them to walk long distances to access medical services.\n\nKwidini said this is a result of a lack of accommodation facilities at some rural clinics.\n\nIt is true that we need doctors in rural hospitals so that elderly people do not have to travel long distances to see doctors. We have a challenge with the doctors houses in district hospitals. This is the challenge that we are facing, which then results in elderly people failing to find those doctors in rural hospitals.\n\nThere is no accommodation for these doctors, but as soon as we put in place accommodation, they will be found nearer to them. For us to put doctors in clinics, it is difficult because the patient ratio is not enough, he said.\n\nThe countrys health system is in dire straits, leaving the majority to rely on private facilities, with the poor left to contend with the public hospitals.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has pledged to address the situation at public hospitals, with a section of Parirenyatwa Hospital undergoing renovations.\n\n",

            "content": "The Guardian\n\nThe number of asylum seekers being housed in hotels has risen by 8% to 32,059 in a year, according toHome Officedata.\n\nThe data also shows that the government is processing asylum applications much more quickly, with 71,000 cases awaiting approval, relating to 91,000 people, compared with 134,000 two years ago.\n\nThe figures come amidgrowing clamour from councilsto block hotels being used to house asylum seekers through legal action, after a court ruled that more than 100applicants staying in Essex should be removed.\n\nThe high court judgment has led to ministers bracing for further legal challenges from across the country and pressure on the government to find other places to house people.\n\nThe latest Home Office figures, published on Thursday as part of the usual quarterly immigration statistics, cover Labours first year in office.\n\nThere were 32,059 asylum seekers in UK hotels by the end of June, up from 29,585 at the same point a year earlier, when the Conservatives were still in power, but down slightly on the 32,345 figure at the end of March.\n\nThe latest number is still below the peak of 56,042 asylum seekers in hotels at the end of September 2023 under the Tories.\n\nFor the first time in four years, the asylum applications backlog has fallen below 100,000 people. It is now just over 70,000 cases, relating to almost 91,000 people  down by 18% from a year earlier and its lowest since September 2021.\n\nIn the year ending June 2025, the Home Office forcibly removed 9,100 people  up a quarter on the previous year. More than half were foreign national offenders who were being deported at the end of sentences.\n\nEnver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: Bringing the asylum system back from the brink of collapse is a genuine achievement in the governments first year. The increase in asylum decisions means refugees can begin to rebuild their lives sooner, and the use of costly hotels can be ended faster.\n\nYvette Cooper, the home secretary, said: The action we have taken in the last 12 months  increasing returns of failed asylum seekers by over 30%, cutting asylum costs by 11%, reducing the backlog by 18% and our forthcoming plans to overhaul the failing asylum appeal system  are crucial steps to restoring order, and putting an end to the chaotic use of asylum hotels that we inherited from the previous government.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Conservative-run authority in Epping Forest won a temporary high court injunction to remove people from the Bell hotel.\n\nAbout 140 asylum seekers must leave the hotel by 12 September after the high court imposed a temporary injunction against them staying there.\n\nThe Labour-run Wirral and Tamworth councils are among more than 10 that are reportedly considering legal challenges to close hotels housing asylum seekers in their area.\n\nOn Tuesday, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, named three Conservative councils that were considering legal action in efforts to shut down asylum hotels in their areas.\n\nAsked how many Tory councils were considering legal action, he told BBC Breakfast: There are certainly a number who are actively considering it. Broxbourne, which is next door to Epping, is one of them. I think Reigate and Banstead is another, Hillingdon is yet a third.\n\nSo, I think there are many up and down the country who are looking at this following the Epping ruling.\n\nWhitehall sources said the government was expected to appeal against the Epping ruling.\n\nCharles Falconer, a Labour peer who served as justice secretary under Tony Blair and was previously Starmers shadow attorney general, urged ministers to appeal.\n\nHe told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme the judgment causes great problems because it gives rise to the expectation that some asylum hotels can be closed but without indicating which ones.\n\nI very strongly urge the government  I dont know what theyre going to do  to appeal and get some certainty, first of all on which should be closed  and which shouldnt, secondly to deal with the question of a reasonable timescale in relation to this, and thirdly to deal with this very troublesome issue: namely, do demonstrations outside these hostels lead it to it being more likely that they will be closed, he said.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist party (DUP) is also seeking to remove asylum seekers from hotels in Northern Ireland after the landmark ruling in England.\n\nAntrim & Newtownabbey borough council has launched an enforcement investigation into the use of the Chimney Corner in Mallusk to house asylum seekers after a complaint by the DUP Stormont assembly member Trevor Clarke.\n\nThe party  the second-biggest in Northern Ireland  would also lodge complaints about the other two hotels that house asylum seekers in two other council areas, Clarke said.\n\nWednesdayshigh court rulingthat the Bell hotel in Essex cannot be used to house asylum seekers because of a breach of planning rules paved the way for similar legal challenges, Clarke said.\n\nHousing asylum seekers in hotels without first securing a change of use through the proper planning process (from hotel to hostel or immigration centre accommodation) constitutes a breach of planning regulations. No one is above the law, not even government departments. If the Home Office or its contractors wish to place large numbers of illegal immigrants into our communities, they must follow the same planning rules as everyone else.\n\nThe other hotels that house asylum seekers in Northern Ireland were in the Causeway Coast and Glens and the Ards and North Down council areas, theIrish News reported.\n\nHome Office spending on asylum in the UK stood at 4.76bn in 2024-25, down 12% from a record 5.38bn in 2023-24, government figures show. The total covers all Home Office costs related to asylum, including direct cash support and accommodation, plus wider staffing and other migration and borders activity.\n\nAsylum seekers and their families can be housed in temporary accommodation, known as contingency accommodation, if they are awaiting assessment of their claim or have had a claim approved and there is not enough longer-term accommodation available.\n\nWhen there is not enough housing, the Home Office, which has a legal obligation to provide accommodation to asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute, can move people to alternatives such as hotels and large sites, such as former military bases.\n\n",

The demand for social protection, food assistance, and resilience-building continues to grow and central to delivering these services is reliable mobility, ensuring that officials and teams can reach every corner of the country quickly, safely, and effectively.\n\nThese nine vehicles are therefore an investment in delivery capacity. They will support the ministry in monitoring programmes, reaching vulnerable communities, and ensuring that national social protection and food assistance systems are stronger, faster, and more responsive. In this way, becoming tools of service and impact, added Clemens.\n\nIn addition to the vehicles, WFP also donated digital media equipment to aid the ministrys communications work as documenting progress, sharing stories, and enhancing visibility were equally vital in strengthening accountability and mobilising support.\n\nAs he received the keys to one of the vehicles for a test drive, Moyo said, It is with great pleasure that we gather here to receive yet another post from the World Food Programme in the form of vehicles.\n\nThe minister remains grateful for the support that the World Food Programme continues to render in this commitment to the people of Zimbabwe in ensuring food security goals are met.\n\nWe continue to make a difference in the delivery of social protection services in the ministry, Moyo said.\n\nHe commended WFP for the provision of support to the government and empowering its staff in the districts where it is present.\n\nIt has been noted that in all the districts that you have provided support, the staff are more empowered in claim distribution, supply chain management and logistical arrangements.\n\nThe ministry desires that you continue to spread this knowledge across the other districts we have not yet implemented. As we jointly implement the food deficit mitigation strategy, we insist on assistance.\n\nMoyo highlighted, We noted gaps, and I am glad that we are here today to pluck one of those gaps through motorisation of the department. You have helped me accept the main variables, which will go a long way to support our social protection programs and facilitate program implementation, enabling the ministry to meet its targets as we look forward to completing the implementation of NTS1 and getting NTS2 towards vision 2030.\n\nSaid Moyo: We rest assured that the ministry will ensure that these variables are put to good use and managed according to government policies and regulations. Priorities shall be given to the hard-to-reach areas, considering terrain in a bid to leave no one and no place behind. May I, on behalf of the Government of Zimbabwe, take this opportunity to thank the World Food Programme for its continued support.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Harare Magistrates Court has convicted and jailed for nine years a former Highview Clinic accountant on charges of fraud and money laundering.\n\nAfter a full trial, Tonderai Shayimana (30) was found guilty of siphoning funds meant for the medical institution into his personal accounts after a full trial.\n\nIn sentencing, the magistrate imposed a nine-year jail term, of which six years were suspended.\n\nThree were scrapped on condition of good behaviour and another three on condition of restitution.\n\nShayimana will serve an effective three-year prison term for fraud.\n\nOn the money laundering charge, he was handed a five-year sentence wholly suspended.\n\nMagistrates heard that between August 2023 and March 2024, Shayimana created and used fake company email accounts to mislead medical aid societies, fraudulently instructing them to divert payments due to the clinic into his First Capital Bank account and Ecobank Nostro account.\n\nProsecutors revealed that he pocketed ZWL$15,362,415, ZIG$95,409 and US$123,739, which he later converted into personal assets.\n\nThe offender deliberately abused his position of trust and orchestrated a sophisticated scheme to deprive the clinic and medical societies of large sums of money, the court noted.\n\nWith the proceeds of crime, Shayimana purchased a residential stand in Budiriro for US$6,500, developed it into a seven-roomed house complete with a durawall, security cameras and solar system, and also bought a Nissan NV200 vehicle. Both the house and the vehicle have since been forfeited to the State.\n\nThe court said deterrent penalties in cases of insider fraud would serve justice.\n\nConvicted white-collar criminals will face stiff penalties and ill-got wealth will be forfeited, the National Prosecuting Authority said, commenting on the conviction.\n\n",
