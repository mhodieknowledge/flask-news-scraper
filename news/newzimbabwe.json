            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court of Zimbabwe has dismissed a contentious application to remove Cecil Madondo, the Corporate Rescue Practitioner (CRP) for MCA Venture Capital (Pvt) Ltd, signalling a victory for procedural integrity amid allegations of misconduct.\n\nThe courts judgment arose from an application filed by South African liquidators Lizanne Chantal Muller and Mari Haywood, who sought Madondos removal over claims he failed to execute a court-approved Corporate Rescue Plan and improperly handled funds owed to creditors.\n\nIn his ruling, Justice Regis Dembure said thecourt does not order the removal of a CRP lightly.\n\nCentral to the applicants allegations was the assertion that Madondo mismanaged a crucial dividend payment of US$610,319.47 to MCA South Africa, a creditor of MCA Venture Capital, following the application for Exchange Control Approval from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe.\n\nThe court noted a lack of evidence that Madondo had acted unlawfully, emphasising, In the absence of approval from the RBZ, it cannot be said that the first respondent failed in his statutory duty to implement the plan.\n\nMadondo faced scrutiny for allegedly prioritising his fees and business expenses before addressing creditor claims.\n\nHowever, the judgment highlighted that his actions fell within the permissible expenses outlined in the Corporate Rescue Plan: The [Plan] explicitly allowed the first respondent to make deductions for corporate rescue costs, including his fees.\n\nIn response to the applicants concerns of conflict of interest over his dual roles, the court stated that there was insufficient proof of Madondo being influenced by MCA Ventures management, asserting, There is no conflict of interest where [the CRP] exercised his powers to pay the corporate rescue costs.\n\nThe ruling is seen as a landmark reaffirmation of the safeguards intended in corporate rescue procedures, adhering to the principle that the duty to act in the best interest of all creditors remains paramount. Madondo, in defense of his conduct throughout the rescue process, stated, I made every effort to comply with the legal requirements stipulated by both the Corporate Rescue Plan and the court.\n\nMuller and Haywoods claims painted a grim picture of mismanagement and deceit, but ultimately, the legal discourse suggested that the applicants may have acted prematurely by seeking immediate removal of the CRP without fully exploring all avenues of resolution through the Master of the High Court.\n\nDembure said, The Master must be allowed to deal with the above-stated matters first, as he supervises the first respondent.\n\nThe court ordered that the application be dismissed with costs, emphasising the need for future vigilance and cooperation among all parties involved in corporate rescues.\n\nThe judge said the issues before the Master are not issues the court should be called upon to determine in this application.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA High Court judge has blasted a magistrate for imposing a lenient sentence on a single mother of four caught with almost a kilogram of dagga, ruling that the punishment fell short of real and substantial justice.\n\nJustice Esther Muremba reviewed the case of Christine Chambati (39), who was arrested at Madokero Mall in June with 962.6 grammes of dagga hidden in her satchel. The drugs had an estimated street value of US$96.20.\n\nChambati admitted the charge and was convicted, but the magistrate gave her a suspended jail term and 420 hours of community service, citing her guilty plea, remorse and her status as a mother.\n\nJustice Muremba said the magistrate misapplied the Criminal Procedure (Sentencing Guidelines) Regulations, 2023, which set a presumptive penalty of three years imprisonment for cases involving large quantities of drugs or possession in public spaces.\n\nThe sentence imposed was not only inconsistent with the regulatory framework but also failed to reflect the structured approach intended to promote fairness, proportionality, and consistency in sentencing, Justice Muremba ruled.\n\nMuremba criticised the magistrates view that 962.6g was a small amount, saying precedent showed even 700g warranted prison time. Citing past cases, the judge said: Quantities well below this threshold constitute substantial amounts.\n\nThe judge stressed that being caught at a busy shopping mall aggravated the offence: Possession of dangerous drugs in a public setting attracts the presumptive penalty of three years imprisonment.\n\nWhile confirming Chambatis conviction, Justice Muremba refused to certify the sentence, leaving the door open for a harsher penalty.\n\nLenient sentences such as community service for possession of nearly a kilogram of dagga fall short of the justice systems duty to protect society, she warned.\n\n",

Ministry of Tourism and Hospitality Industry, Ministry of Local Government and Public Works were nowhere to be seen, same as the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage. We want to encourage the Government of Zimbabwe to support such traditional and cultural heritage events, said Molokela.\n\nThe Government is at odds with the Ndebele King, Bulelani Khumalo, a descendant of Mzilikazi, refusing to recognise his kingship.\n\nMolokela further said Mzilikazi Day should be honoured and celebrated by the country.\n\nThe event attracted participants from all over Zimbabwe and some from the diaspora, especially from South Africa. Thousands of people from different generations, elders, youths, children, women, men, rural people and urban people attended the event from different cultures and languages.\n\nZimbabwe prides itself in cultural heritage, it prides itself in national identity and also decolonisation in terms of identity. An event like the one which we held on Saturday is something that as Zimbabweans, we must celebrate and encourage all districts, provinces, cultures and all languages in Zimbabwe to organise such kind of events so that as a nation, we can also be recognised that we have gone beyond the colonial system, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "ByPeter Fabricius,Daily Maverick\n\nSince his arrest on 13 April, Wellington Masiwa has been in prison for illegally entering South Africa and for alleged fraud in Zimbabwe.\n\nZimbabwean opposition activists believe the South African authorities are colluding with Zimbabwes ruling Zanu-PF party to extradite a vocal critic of the Zimbabwean government from South Africa to Zimbabwe.\n\nWellington Masiwa, aka Comrade Nyokayemabhunu, has been detained in the Johannesburg Correctional Centre since he was arrested on 13 April for illegally entering South Africa and for alleged fraud in Zimbabwe.\n\nBefore that, he was held and assaulted by unknown men in an unknown place, according to his legal representatives.\n\nWhen he appeared in the Randburg Magistrates Court on 30 April on an illegal immigration charge, his lawyers were surprised when an Interpol representative showed up and laid new charges against him based on an extradition request from the Zimbabwean government.\n\nWhen the representative appeared in court at a later hearing in July, the crowd of opposition Zimbabwean citizens supporting Masiwa grew angry, suspecting new charges were being brought against him.\n\nSouth Africas justice minister, Mmamoloko Kubayi, is expected to rule this week on whether Masiwa is extraditable.\n\nThe extradition notice from Zimbabwes deputy prosecutor-general, Nelson Mutsonziwa, certified that Zimbabwe wanted him returned to serve an 18-month sentence for defrauding a fellow Zimbabwean, Prince Kutivo, of $3,660 in a fraudulent property deal in Harare.\n\nThis request is not being pursued for political reasons or any ulterior purpose, Mutsonziwa insisted.\n\nHowever, there are many anomalies in the case which cast doubt on Mutsonziwas assurances. For instance, another alleged fraud case against Masiwa has arisen. Masiwa says that he was arrested through a trap set by Zimbabwes notorious Central Intelligence Organisation and sprung by a fellow Zimbabwean activist, Honest Sibanda.\n\nThis appears to be another name for Honest Shumba, who has formally charged Masiwa with cheating him of some R24,000, which he paid Masiwa in Harare in July 2024 for a couch which Masiwa never delivered.\n\nMasiwa flatly denies the deal and says he was in South Africa when the transaction allegedly occurred.\n\nMasiwas attorney, Yugeshnee Govender, told Daily Maverick the prosecution had been unable to produce bank statements to prove Shumba paid this money into Masiwas bank account. The Zimbabwean government has not mentioned the Shumba case in its request for extradition.\n\nMasiwa, his lawyers and his opposition comrades believe the Shumba incident was invented to strengthen Zimbabwes case for his extradition. They believe the real reason the Zimbabwe government wants him home is that he has been a strident critic of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, and particularly of his political manoeuvring to try to secure a third term when his second  and constitutionally, final  term expires in 2028.\n\nUntil shortly before his arrest, Masiwa was posting calls on X and other social media, calling on Zimbabweans to join a national shutdown on 31 March to protest at Mnangagwas suspected plans to bypass or amend the Constitution so as to remain in power.\n\nIn an affidavit before the Randburg Magistrates Court seeking bail  which has so far been denied  Masiwa said that before his arrest he had had a WhatsApp channel called Nyokayemabhunu News.\n\nIt had been an important instrument in protest news in Zimbabwe. Masiwa said he was opposed to the campaign for the extension of Mnangagwas presidential term, which had come to be known as 2030 by Zanu-PF.\n\nThe extension is not in terms of the Zimbabwean Constitution, he said, insisting he had only advocated for peaceful means to stop the illegal subversion of the Zimbabwean Constitution by the ruling party in Zimbabwe, Zanu-PF. It is for this reason that I have been declared an enemy of the state by the Zimbabwean government and Zanu-PF.\n\nZanu-PF has called several press conferences to celebrate my arrest in South Africa and have indicated that they would want to charge me with terrorism for illegally attempting to remove a constitutionally elected government  which carries the death penalty.\n\nThe Progressive Zimbabwean Foundation, which says it represents numerous progressive forces and pressure groups, issued a statement in August expressing concern that Zimbabwes request for the extradition of Masiwa was political rather than legal.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Cde Nyokayemabhunus arrest and detention raise serious concerns about the separation of politics from the justice system, particularly in a foreign nation like South Africa, said the foundations General Sithole.\n\nHe added that remarks by Zanu-PFs secretary for information and publicity, Chris Mutsvangwa, further reinforces the notion that this is a political matter.\n\nDuring a press conference at Zanu-PF headquarters in Harare on 8 May, Mutsvangwa said Zanu-PF was very happy that South Africa had taken steps to show that it was not prepared to tolerate Zanu-PFs critics using South Africa as a platform for their criticism.\n\nMentioning Nyokayemabhunu by name, he said, Some people have got the mistaken idea that you can go and be hosted in South Africa and start shouting bad things about Zimbabwe and talking subversion.\n\nThey have got a new comeuppance by South African laws. They are being told: Not here. We are a sister republic to Zimbabwe. We fought with Zanu-PF. We know each other. This is not your home.\n\nMutsvangwa said he hoped the legal action that South Africa was taking against Masiwa is a signal to others who are spewing hatred and vituperation  about Zanu-PF and our leader that South Africa cant tolerate. It cant be a home for vitriol against Zimbabwe.\n\nHowever, South African Police Service Captain Willem van der Heever testified, in a court affidavit responding to Masiwa, that the conviction in Zimbabwe has nothing to do with the political climate in Zimbabwe.\n\nVan der Heever said he was Interpols investigating officer in this matter, stationed at the Interpol extradition desk in Pretoria and that he had received Zimbabwes request for extradition through Interpol and had obtained a warrant for Masiwas arrest from the Kempton Park Magistrates Court on the basis of it on 29 April.\n\nVan der Heever cited deputy prosecutor-general Mutsonziwas certificate stating that Zimbabwe was only seeking Masiwas extradition to serve an 18-month sentence in the 2016 case for fraud against Kutivo.\n\nYet in his affidavit Van der Heever also cited Honest Shumbas alleged couch fraud complaint.\n\nGovender told Daily Maverick that Masiwa and his legal team were waiting for Justice Minister Kubayi to decide whether Masiwas case was extraditable. Govender said she believed the amount of the alleged fraud involved in this case was not great enough to warrant extradition.\n\nGovender said Kubayis ruling on this might be announced when Masiwa appeared in court again on 10 September. Masiwa said he fled Zimbabwe in 2017, fearing for his safety after being beaten by government agents after Mnangagwa ousted President Robert Mugabe in a coup.\n\nMasiwa now lives in Gqeberha with his wife and is a granite cutter. He has applied for political asylum in South Africa, but his court cases have interrupted his application.DM\n\n",
