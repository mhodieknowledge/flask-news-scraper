            "content": "VogueUK\n\nTheres a mighty bouquet of blush-pink roses almost wilting in Rachel Chinouriris house right now. Theyre kind of going off, admits the 26-year-old musician, one of Britains most exciting new stars. She wont be getting rid of them anytime soon. The occasion? A celebration of Chinouriris twoBrit nominations. The sender? Adele.\n\nThat was mental and incredibly unexpected, Chinouriri recalls of the surprise delivery from her fellow Brit School alumni. Sipping a dirty chai latte in a coffee spot in Hackney Wick, the singer-songwriter  who recently created a tour journal of random items given to her by fans at shows  is notably sentimental about these things. I need to press the good flowers that are left because I want to put them in a frame\n\nSomething tells me this wont be the last extravagant bouquet she will receive from music legends. At 26, Chinouriri has achieved the modern indie pop princess fantasy: stratospheric virality with endlessly catchy tracks such as the raw So My Darling, a tribute to a dear friend, and pop anthem All I Ever Asked. Now a die-hard audience lingers on her every word and fans suchFlorence Pugh(or my Flossie Pop! as Chinouriri calls her) slide into the singers DMs to profess their love for her music (the singer and actor ended up with a new friendship, and Pugh a cameo in Chinouriris music video for Never Need Me). In 2024 her gut-punch debut album,What a Devastating Turn of Events, landed in the top 20 and she closed out a run of sold-out shows. Now she is in arenas supporting Sabrina Carpenter on the European leg of herShort n Sweettour, to say nothing of releasing a new EP next month.\n\nIm really happy with how the journey has gone, says the south London-born star, bathed in the glow of mid-morning winter sun. I think, when youre 18, you are obviously like, Oh, my God, I want to blow up. You see people your age or younger getting to those heights  which is amazing  but minus those heights, what do you want your legacy to be? Because I want to be doing this forever. Thats not to say its been easy. During her rise, Chinouriri found herself pigeonholed as an urban artist and being introduced as the next R&B soulstress, despite her music being nothing of the sort. In January 2022, she published an open letter in a bid to stop being mislabelled. Has she noticed an industry change since then? I think theres been a realisation that Black girls can be marketed [outside of assumed Black genres], but until I see more than just me, Cat [Burns] and Olivia [Dean], then things arent changing. Its a shame I had to be so loud about it.\n\nGrowing up in Croydon, Chinouriri discovered music in earnest at secondary school, inspired by her musically inclined Zimbabwean South African family. Visits to her aunties house always ended with prayer and song. Theyd start singing and everyone would harmonise. My brain almost felt it spiritually  it would give me tingles. With the encouragement of a well-meaning teacher, eventually she would end up at The Brit School studying musical theatre. I was like, If I dont get in, I wont ever touch music again, she recalls, matter-of-factly. To think that I wouldnt have even tried simply because I didnt get into the school Its quite sad.\n\nFlash forward to today and Chinouriri is already plotting out album number two, while adding the finishing touches to her forthcoming EP,Little House, out on 4 April. Shes been experiencing something of a songwriting evolution over the past year. I started writing music because of trauma  it was a gateway to help me get out of very difficult things when I was younger, Chinouriri says, referring in part to the aggressive bullying she was a victim of at school. Id gotten quite accustomed to: Im having a terrible time, so I can write a great song quite easily. But things change. Ive gone to therapy Im in a healthy relationship But by doing that, I ended up unable to write for nearly a year, she says. Recently she found herself wondering: How do I write without self-sabotaging mentally? Then she realised she could write about joy instead. Im in love with someone and its healthy, she says, smiling at her new inspiration. Love makes you do the corniest things.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nSouth Africas road to the 2026 Fifa World Cup has hit a potential roadblock following a yellow-card controversy surrounding midfielder Teboho Mokoena. Reports suggest that Mokoena may have been ineligible to play in Bafana Bafanas crucial Matchday 5 clash against Lesotho, which could significantly affect the teams chances of qualifying.\n\nMokoena, a central figure in South Africas midfield, received a yellow card in their opening match against Benin (MD1) and another in the following match against Zimbabwe (MD4). According to Fifas regulations, a player who accumulates two yellow cards in separate matches must serve a one-match suspension. This means Mokoena should not have featured in the Lesotho encounter.\n\nDespite the clear rules, Mokoena was included in the starting line-up for the Matchday 5 match against Lesotho, playing 81 minutes before being substituted. If the reports are confirmed, this could be a violation of Fifas qualification regulations, and South Africa may face a points deduction for fielding an ineligible player.\n\nCurrently, Bafana sit at the top of Group C with 10 points, just ahead of Benin (eight points) and Rwanda (seven points). A points deduction would not only see them lose their top spot but also tighten the race for automatic qualification. Nigeria, with just six points, could also capitalise on any misstep by South Africa. Given the competitive nature of Group C, even a small slip could be costly in the long run.\n\nThe issue stems from Fifas World Cup Qualifiers Rulebook, specifically sub-section 9, which clearly states that a player who receives two yellow cards in separate matches must serve a one-match suspension. If the suspension rule is applied and Mokoenas eligibility is found to be invalid, South Africa could lose the three points from their 2-0 win over Lesotho  a decision that would significantly impact the standings and increase pressure on the team in the final rounds of qualifiers.\n\nIn unrelated news, SAFA are also facing internal challenges.\n\nReports have emerged that Safa employees did not receive their salaries for March on time due to a delayed payment from one of their partners. A letter sent to staff members on Monday stated that salaries would be delayed, citing a lack of adequate financial reserves to cover the delay.\n\nThe March salaries will be paid by March 31, 2025, the letter concluded, adding further complications to an already tumultuous period for South African football.\n\n",

Inside the main bedroom safe, the robbers took an additional US$55,000.\n\nAs the robbers continued their raid, Elphas Maruta, armed with a 303 rifle loaded with four rounds, advanced toward the house after being alerted to the robbery.\n\nA shootout ensued, with Maruta firing two shots and the suspects firing back three shots.\n\nThe gang ultimately fled the scene with a total of US$74,600 in cash and valuables. Police later recovered stolen property worth US$3,800.\n\nThe suspects are also implicated in a separate robbery on February 25, targeting Cossam Siminya at his residence.\n\nAround 3 am, the accused and their accomplices, armed with pistols, sjamboks, iron bars, and a hammer, broke into the home after waking the complainant and his wife, Precious Makore, with the noise of their barking dogs.\n\nMakore, upon investigating, alerted her husband after hearing banging noises at the back door.\n\nWhile she attempted to seek help from a neighbour, the robbers forced entry and began ransacking the house.\n\nThey confronted Panashe Zhuwawo, who was sleeping in a spare bedroom, and stole his cellphone.\n\nOutside, neighbours who came to assist fled after one of the robbers fired two warning shots into the air.\n\nMeanwhile, the gang confronted another resident, Jane Manokore, stealing a 49-inch Samsung television, cash totaling US$700, a cellphone, and other valuables.\n\nThe robbers then entered Siminyas bedroom, stealing US$10,000 in cash, an iPhone 14 Pro, a Tecno Spark 8, groceries, and other items.\n\nThe suspects also raided a tuck shop on the property, severely assaulting Bosco Chidukudze before stealing a small Samsung cellphone.\n\nThe total value of goods stolen in the second robbery was US$13,220, and nothing has been recovered.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/i-feel-really-really-cross-at-incredibly-dumb-decisions-stephen-sackur-on-the-end-of-hardtalk-and-leaving-the-bbc/",
            "content": "The Guardian\n\nStephen Sackur makes no bones about it: he is not going willingly. I dont want to leave theBBC, because I still think Ive got a lot to offer, the HARDtalk presenter tells me. And I dont want the programme to be closed, but that argument has been definitively lost. Im thinking hard about other things Im going to do. Im fine. Im feeling quite positive. Maybe. But I think hes also feeling hurt, betrayed and, though he denies it, a little angry. Its definitely a strange period, he says. Were talking in February, a month before the show finishes and hes sent packing by the Beeb.\n\nSackur, 61, is a BBC lifer. He started out as a trainee in 1986, was made a foreign correspondent in 1990, and went on to some of the biggest gigs in journalism  Europe, Washington, the Middle East. For the past 19 years, hes hosted HARDtalk, the interview show that holds global power to account. The BBC has always lauded it as a flagship programme  thrice weekly, regularly watched in more than 200 countries by up to 70 million people (and, he reckons, with the podcast and World Service radio versions that figure could rise to 170 million). Which is why he got such a shock when he wastold in October that it was being pulled.\n\nAs you might expect, Sackur has not taken the end of the show lying down. After the announcement, he put out a message on X, explaining why it was sad for him personally but more importantly a depressing day for the BBC.\n\nHe made his point in a series of uncompromising posts. At a time when disinformation and media manipulation are poisoning public discourse HARDtalk is unique: a long-form interview show with only one mission  to hold to account those who all too often avoid accountability in their own countries, he wrote. Anyone who has seen our interviews with Hugo Chvez, Sergey Lavrov, Meles Zenawi, Lula, Nancy Pelosi, Recep Tayyip Erdoan, Emmanuel Macron, Imran Khan, Olusegun Obasanjo and countless others over the years will know HARDtalk was never just another news show. A brilliant team of producers and researchers is being disbanded  My commitment to rigorous exploration of world affairs wont change. I hope the BBCs doesnt either. Hardly a humble assessment of HARDTalk or his own career, but a fair one.\n\nWere in Sackurs lovely kitchen  stylish, hi-tech, posh coffee machine on the countertop, gorgeous contemporary art on the walls. He asks where Id like to sit. The sofa looks good, I say. But hes already moving towards the table, turning the kitchen into an improvised HARDtalk studio. He sits one side, Im opposite  the format hes used to. Its astonishing how many world leaders have subjected themselves to his interrogations, wrongly assuming they can best him in debate.\n\nHe is a tall, thin man, straight as an ironing board, with strong arms and a military bearing  undoubtedly officer class. Sackurs style of interviewing is forensic and barristerial. Rather than getting interviewees to open up, its more about putting the case for the prosecution, and watching them squirm or try to worm their way out of it. And he can gets great lines from guests. In 2009, Boris Johnson, then mayor of London, told him that the 250,000 a year he received for writinga weekly newspaper column was chicken feed a quote that has stuck.\n\nSackur tells me hes not taking voluntary redundancy, which he has been offered, because there is nothing voluntary about it. If the BBC is giving him the old heave-ho, it can at least do it honestly. Youre forcing them to make you redundant? Yes. I suppose its a little bit of obstinacy and just saying: OK, well, you think very hard. Youve got a journalist here whos got a lot of experience, who probably has a longer track record of covering international affairs than almost anybody in the BBC. I have pretty good contacts, know a lot of people in a lot of places. If they decide thats not what they want and need, thats fine, but Id like them to be clear about that.\n\nAlthough the HARDtalk budget had been cut in recent years, there was no suggestion that it would be axed. He says he only had one proper conversation with the director-general, Tim Davie, in five years, and that went positively. I rang him up when he got the job and I said: I just want to say hi and well done. And he said: Its great to talk to you. I appreciate how important HARDtalk is, particularly in terms of our international offer and profile. I look forward to coming down and seeing the team, which he never did. He invited me to a gathering of journalists from different parts of the BBC, but otherwise Ive never spoken or heard from him again. And, since the closure announcement, Ive not heard a word.\n\nA few weeks after the decision was taken, Sackur says, he was invited to a meeting with BBCs head of news, Deborah Turness. It didnt yield a change of mind or any hint that there would be a change of mind. So what was the point of it? Thats a very good question. I think she felt embarrassed that she had never met me. Because, if you remember, after the announcement was made, there was a massive response in this country and around the world. A lot of very senior journalists expressed their surprise and disquiet about it. And quite a few other people as well. And it did have a bit of an impact.\n\nOne of his recent interviewees was the former Washington Post editor Marty Baron. Sackur took a scalpel to him in typical fashion, suggesting that old-fashioned, top-down mainstream media has had its day, and that Baron, 70, was just another white, middle-aged privileged man the world had tired of hearing from. The same could be said of you, couldnt it, I say. He nods. Yes, I could have been talking to myself.\n\nWell, youre slightly posher than Baron, I say. He laughs. So Im even more of a problem! Yes, Im part of the same sort of media elite, and I am white and getting on a bit and all of this applies to me, and HARDtalk might well be better refreshing itself with a new presenter who carries a bit less of that baggage for sure. But, he says, even if the Beeb thought he should be put out to grass, the show shouldnt have been. Take me off HARDtalk? I totally get it. Every old horse at some point has to be taken off to the glue factory. But dont kill off the programme.\n\nActually, he says, he has thought for some time he should move on and try something new. The trouble is he enjoyed the show so much. Whats not to like about travelling the world talking to interesting people? A lot of journalists I respect greatly say to me: You have the best job in journalism. In terms of an ability to engage with whats interesting in this world of ours, theres no job like it.\n\nIts lunchtime, and Sackur suggests a visit to his local. Were just off to the pub, he shouts up to his partner, Ana, whom he has been with for five years. He was married for more than 20 years and has three adult children. As we stroll down the south London street, he talks about his own childhood. Sackur grew up in a middle-class family in Spilsby, Lincolnshire. His father, he says, was hard to pigeonhole  a Cambridge University graduate with a degree in agriculture who became a Guardian-reading farmer and stood twice, unsuccessfully, to become a Labour MP in Tory heartlands. His mother came from farming stock. Sackur was a bright boy gifted with a ruthlessly logical mind and an ability to out-argue others. He also went to Cambridge, where he studied history. Desperate to escape the isolated rural environment he grew up in, he realised that journalism was the perfect way to do it.\n\nWe order Guinness and chips at the bar, and head off to a booth. I ask him whether hes a nightmare over the dinner table, always arguing his case, always having to win. I think I was a bit of a nightmare as a kid because I was argumentative and wouldnt let it drop. Sometimes I didnt see that the best thing to do was to back down.\n\nWhat has he learned from interviewing so many significant figures? Ive learned a lot about the ego. Human beings are hugely flawed and are desperate to cover up their flaws. Has it made him look at his own flaws? Very much so. What are his main ones? Selfishness, self-absorption, being preoccupied with my place in things rather than  He comes to a stop. Did this affect his relationship with his family? Yeah, thats where I would go, but I dont want to talk about personal stuff that is difficult. I think Im a more rounded human being than I was years ago, for sure.\n\nHow has he changed? Im more tolerant. I was something of a control freak: I would expect and look for a neatness  a literal neatness and a sort of figurative neatness  in life. And Id try to impose it when, as I can see much more clearly now, life isnt neat and to be rounded up and squared off all tidy. In the past, it would leave me grumpy and intolerant in a way that was completely counterproductive. Now Im better able to live with the rough edges.\n\nHe admits he finds it tough talking about personal things  partly because hes private and partly because it inevitably involves other people he has no right to talk about. Some of it is too painful, and painful not just to me, but painful to other people that I really dont want to hurt.\n\nSo we retreat to safer ground. I ask about his most memorable guests on HARDtalk. There are so many, he says Venezuelan president Hugo Chvez, who treated Sackur with contempt before warming to him; Russian dissident Alexei Navalny, the most courageous man hes met; the tortured Allen Ault, who had beenin charge of executions in Georgia; Bill Clinton, whose magnetism made Tony Blair look second division on the charisma front; the brutal Ethiopian dictator Meles Zenawi. It was only when he returned to Ethiopia, he says, that he realised the impact of his interview with Zenawi. Id meet people on the street and theyd be quoting from it like it was verses from Shakespeare. The thing is, he says, theyd never heard Zenawi held to account before.\n\nDoes he think BBC bigwigs are aware of the significance of HARDtalk? No. I dont think at the very senior levels of the BBC there is an awareness of just how big a show HARDtalk is around the world. Perhaps people like Turness are too removed from the journalism to make important decisions about it? Ill tell you what I think. I think it is deeply regrettable that people like Deborah Turness do not spend more time making a point of hanging out with people like me. I think that would be incredibly beneficial for them, given their importance as layers-down of the sort of strategic direction of BBC News and current affairs. Again, I dont want to sound in any way egomaniacal, but I do have a lot of experience and you would think that that experience would be useful to take advice from, to tap into as a resource for those people who are defining strategic priorities.\n\nSackur is alarmed at the way news priorities have changed at the BBC. Programmes like HARDtalk, Panorama and Newsnight have long had a huge amount of autonomy. Increasingly there is a desire at the top of the BBC to centralise and control and that doesnt fit easily with these programmes. You can see it in the way Newsnight and Panorama have changed and been resourced. In previous rounds of reform and cuts, weve had our staff reduced, our money reduced, and now were disappearing altogether. Hes worried that with the focus on live news, journalism is being reduced to churnalism at the expense of more studied, groundbreaking work.\n\nPresumably, the BBC wont even save much money by axing HARDtalk, I say. After all, its hardly expensive telly. Dont even get me started on the money! Too late. I think the total sum of money BBC News declared that it had to save in that round of cuts was 24m. HARDtalk represents around 5% of that 24m  1.2m a year. In total. The team is tiny, he says  only eight staff. I cant prove this scientifically, but Im pretty sure that HARDtalk is the cheapest content per minute of broadcasting the BBC does. We represent about four middle to senior management salaries.\n\nDoes he think its a snub to highbrow journalism? No. They know what they want and we dont fit it. But Ive got too much love for the BBC and Ive got too many colleagues at the BBC who are still doing fantastic work to think that they dont want serious journalism.\n\nHe stops, and says its important to get this right. Im not leaving, raging with bitterness and resentment and the feeling that the BBC is slashing, burning and ruining the sort of journalism that I believe in. That would be simple. Its more subtle and more complex than that.\n\nWe catch up a few weeks later in mid-March. Sackur has just received his redundancy letter and been served three months notice. He is devastated for his small but perfectly formed team, and now there is no attempt to disguise his anger. I feel really, really cross at incredibly dumb decisions made by management that I fear is not doing the right thing for the BBC. I have not been impressed with their ability to deal with this in a compassionate, human way.\n\nHe tells me that one of his final interviews was with Christine Lagarde, president of the European Central Bank (ECB). It made plenty of headlines worldwide on Trump and tariffs, he says. Like so many recent guests, she told me she was completely baffled by the closure of HARDtalk. Why would they do it at a time like this? she said. As a sort of consolation she gave me a jar of ECB honey  apparently they have a hive in the banks garden.\n\nOn the positive side, he feels energised and liberated by his new freedom. He talks about his plans for the future. He has just signed a deal to write a book about journalist heroes who have risked everything to make a difference. Im not a brave person, and part of the reason for writing this book is that, over the years, Ive been so blown away by journalists whose work is truly brave in a way that mine never was and never will be. Having it out verbally in a studio doesnt compare with risking your life taking on the corrupt and powerful, he says.\n\nAs for his journalism, hes by no means finished with that. Hed love to do a revamped version of HARDtalk. As I said at the beginning, if you need people who are steeped in international affairs, whove met and reported on so many of the people and places that matter  In other words, Stephen Sackur is open to offers.\n\n",

            "content": "By Owen Gagare | GroundUp News\n\nBelying the beauty of its surroundings in Penhalonga, Manicaland, in eastern Zimbabwe, lies Redwing Mine, a hub of artisanal activity, and a testament to the lawlessness and impunity of Zimbabwes political elite.\n\nApproaching Redwing Mine with its backdrop of towering hills and rugged mountains, you are greeted by an incessant noise of hammer mills and generators. Hundreds of blue canvas tents, each marking a pit, are haphazardly scattered across the landscape. With over 3,000 open pits, thousands of artisanal miners toil in the dirt, searching for gold. Young men and women, including teenagers, descend into the pits with nothing more than rudimentary tools  picks and shovels  and their bare hands.\n\nThere is little regard for safety protocols or regulations. There is a boom gate at the main entrance but people walk in and out without question. The mine is a free-for-all.\n\nDozens of mine shafts are concentrated in areas with rich gold deposits.\n\nRedwing Mine is legally owned by South African mining mogul Mzi Khumalos Metallon Corporation, but the company lost operational control in 2020 when the mine was placed under corporate rescue due to unpaid debts, wage arrears, and statutory obligations. It wasdragged to courtleading to the appointment of an administrator to manage the mine.\n\nAccording to newsreportsandcivil society organisations, Zanu-PF MP Scott Sakupwanya, an ally of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, got involved while the mine was under business rescue. His company, Betterbrands Mining, took control ofvast sectionsand 132 claims at Redwing with thecorporate rescuers assistance, despite not having mining experience.\n\nBetterbrands engaged sponsors  people who were allocated pits to mine  who in turn hired artisanal miners on a large scale.\n\nThis marked the end of formal underground mining and the start of the current chaotic state of the mine.\n\nWith the lawlessness came deaths, corruption and cover ups. The government, law enforcement agencies and regulatory authorities have largely turned a blind eye, despite revelations that senior police and army officers control some of the pits at the mine.\n\nThere are no official records available of the deaths, but civil society organisations estimate that more than 100 people may have died in the open pits since the arrival of Betterbrands Mining. Government did shut the mine twice  in January 2023 following fatal accidents and again in January 2024 after 15 miners were trapped. But on each occasion, mining resumed and little changed. Instead of addressing the issues, a web of secrecy surrounds its operations. But leaked rescue reports, seen during our investigations, and testimonies from family members of the dead are damning.\n\nReport after report, stretching over many months, conclude by saying dangerous or illegal pits will be closed.\n\nRosemary Kaponda has fond memories of her nephew, Gilbert Pedro, who died while working as an artisanal miner.\n\nGilbert Pedro died in March last year apparently from exposure to gas.\n\nWe travelled to Matika Village in Chigodora, about 50km south of Mutare, where Pedro grew up, to speak to his family.\n\nPedros aunt, Rosemary Kaponda, has fond memories of her nephew. With tears in her eyes, she told us, His death pains. It came at a time he was about to establish his own mine. He was in the process of registering his own claim and had acquired a prospectors license.\n\nThese were his final days as an artisanal miner. He was working in dangerous conditions so that he could establish himself. I knew him from a tender age. He was brilliant and tenacious even as a young child and I have no doubt he would have made it big. But sadly, his life was cut short before he could fulfill his vision.\n\nPedro was ten years old when his father died.\n\nAt that time, he was in Grade 5. He was brilliant in school and other children used to call him teacher because teachers used to ask him to explain things to his classmates when they did not understand, she said.\n\nHe did his Advanced Levels at St Werburghs Secondary School here in Chigodora. He got nine points at A-level despite not having adequate books and other resources. He was a gifted child.\n\nAfter his A-Levels, Pedro and Kapondas son Eliah Maina, made their way to Penhalonga to find work.\n\nMaina said that between 2011 and 2012 they worked as camels  people who carry gold ore from one point to another on their backs for artisanal miners near Redwing Mine.\n\nWe would carry gold ore from mining areas to the road, where it would be collected and sent to hammer mills. We got paid US$1 for each sack we carried. It was hard work, but it had no risks, unlike being an artisanal miner, he said.\n\nMaina said he vowed never to become an artisanal miner when he witnessed a fatal accident at one of the pits where he was collecting gold ore in 2012.\n\nThe pit was just nine metres deep but there was a collapse, and one person died on the spot after being crushed by a rock. The other person, who was also trapped, died later at Mutare General Hospital, he said.\n\nIt was a traumatising experience because you could see the people were in pain, but the rescue effort took long. I think the collapse happened around midnight, but they were only rescued after 4am because it was difficult. It was too much for me to handle.\n\nMaina left Penhalonga after the incident, but Pedro stayed on.\n\nEliah Maina worked between 2011 and 2012 as a camel, carrying bags of gold ore for artisanal miners.\n\nWhen the mine was partly annexed by Betterbrands Mine, Pedro ventured into artisanal mining, while saving money to start mining legally.\n\nOne night in March last year, I cannot recall the exact date, said Kapondo, I received a call around 10pm from his young sister who also lives in Penhalonga. I was told that he had died as a result of gassing.\n\nPedro had gone to the mine shaft with his young brother to collect a shovel and other equipment. His younger brother was the first to be lowered into the pit. He tapped on the rope, to indicate he wanted to come out.\n\nWhen he came up he said there was gas in the pit. Pedro decided to go inside, because he believed it was a quick job, just to go and grab the tools and come out, said Maina. Unfortunately, he was gassed.\n\nOther miners were called to blow oxygen into the pit, but it was too late.\n\nThe miners retrieved Pedros body, which was sent to a private mortuary with the assistance of Manicaland Minister of State Mischeck Mugadza. He provided a coffin and food. The family did not get any help from Metallon or Betterbrands. Pedro was buried at the Old West Cemetery in Penhanga.\n\nThe situation is particularly bad at Redwing Mine, said Kapondo. But there is nothing we can do. Those in charge are allowing the deaths to occur without putting in safety measures.\n\nArtisanal miners at Redwing Mine use water pumps to drain water from mine shafts during the rainy season.\n\nMetallon has lost control of the mine, but it keeps staff on site in the hope that it will be able to return it to regulated underground mining.\n\nPolice did not respond to our detailed questions. But incident reports prepared by Metallons rescue team on the mine, leaked to us, confirm that there have been deaths unreported by the authorities.\n\nMost accidents are caused by mine shaft collapses or gassing. Contributing factors include poor hazard awareness, lack of proper re-entry plans, inadequate ground support, defective tools, and congested working areas with poor ventilation and lacking warning systems. Heavy rains also loosen ground and destabilise tunnels. The inexperienced miners do not know how to use machinery properly.\n\nAccording to one of the reports, on 1 September 2024, Takemore Mlambo of Biriri in Chimanimani and his 19-year-old son, Tadiwa, died from gas at a pit in the Zaina section of the mine.\n\nMlambo had a sponsor. Sponsors are pit owners or middlemen between Betterbrands and artisanal miners, who are given peg numbers for pits after paying to be allowed to mine. They supply plastics, tents, timber, generators, food, blowers, work suits, gumboots and pit registration for the miners.\n\nMlambo and four other artisanal miners holed into an old working underground. They then alerted co-workers who immediately hoisted them outside, where they cooked and ate. It is said that the team notified their sponsor of the new development, and they were advised not to continue mining until the next morning. The team however did not listen and hoisted Takemore Mlambo into the pit, which is approximately 40 metres deep.\n\nMlambo stopped communicating with the outside team. Rodwell Dzemura called Tadiwa, who worked at a neighbouring pit, and told him they suspected that his father had been gassed.\n\nTadiwa then bluntly decided to be hoisted down to rescue his father. That was when he got gassed along with his father.\n\nMetallons Redwing Mine Rescue team retrieved the bodies.\n\nEach blue tent signifies a mine shaft. Artisanal miners use the tents to cover shaft openings.\n\nAnother report, dated 3 October 2024, described how the Redwing mine rescue team was dispatched to an abandoned 40-metre deep pit in the Zaina section following reports of a strong, unpleasant odour coming from the site.\n\nThe now deceased was reportedly missing since 27 September 2024, and relatives could not find him. On 2 October at around 19:00, an artisanal miner passed close to the area and smelt a heavy odour coming from the pit. The artisanal miner immediately approached some relatives of the deceased who had been looking for their missing relative, the report reads.\n\nRedwing Mine Rescue Team attended the scene and managed to retrieve the body that was in a decomposing state. Police who attended the incident took the body to Victoria Chitepo Provincial Hospital (VCPH) mortuary.\n\nThe mining manager who signed the report, stated that the pit was not barricaded and claims the deceased was known as a habitual drunkard, and it is therefore suspected that he fell into the pit whilst drunk.\n\nIn another report, dated 29 November 2024, the rescue team retrieved three bodies of a woman and two men who died in a tunnel. The report named them only as Courage, Garikayi and Mai D.\n\nRedwing Mine Rescue Team initiated the rescue around 05:30, the four illegal miners were trapped in an audit tunnel while illegally mining. One casualty was complaining of a spine injury and was admitted in VCPH and the three lifeless bodies were retrieved, the last body was out around 10:20 and handed over to ZRP Penhalonga Police, the report reads.\n\nThe report claims the tunnel was illegally mined, used as a shelter and a hand out [sic] for drug addicts.\n\nA month later, a report dated 30 December, describes how an artisanal miner called Victor Chinyowa (32) from Mafararikwa village in Marange, died from gassing in a 12-metre deep pit. The report says Chinyowa had entered the pit, which had been abandoned since October 2024, to collect his spectacles.\n\nAnother report confirmed that a body was retrieved from the Tsapaota area of the mine on 30 January 2025, a few days after this reporter visited Redwing.\n\nTsapaota is on unstable ground. Fifteen miners were trapped there last year, leading to the government shutting the mine. The miners extracted themselves after a three-day ordeal and the mine was reopened.\n\nDrilling of mine shafts close to each other has been blamed for causing mine collapses. The law says there should be spacing of at least 35 metres between shafts, but this is not the case at Redwing Mine.\n\nOn a visit to the site in January, we discovered that Zanu-PF members, Metallons own workers, individual military personnel and police officers had started their own artisanal mining operations.\n\nWe were told police take bribes to prevent investigations into deaths and mining violations to avoid further shutdowns or bad publicity.\n\nIf the police do have records of accidents and fatalities over the last year, they will not share them. We sent questions to the Zimbabwe Republic Police on 13 February and have received no response.\n\nOn 11 February, we sent questions to mining minister Winston Chitando and permanent secretary, Pfungwa Kunaka, but they did not respond.\n\nMetallon did not respond to questions first sent on 31 January.\n\nBetterbrands did not answer questions first sent on 18 February. Questions were sent to Sakupwanya, his PA, marketing and PR manager, and to mine manager Cuthbert Chitima.\n\nOwen Mbwando, director of Centre for Research for Peace and Development of Africa, which has been closely following events in Penhalonga, said, Deaths are no longer being reported while in some cases normal reporting procedures are not being followed after accidents.\n\nArtisanal miners and civil society organisations say bodies are often moved without the police, under cover of night to avoid drawing attention to the dangers of open-pit mining in the area. In some cases, bribes ensure that investigations into the deaths never take place.\n\nThis story was produced in collaboration with theIJ Hub.\n\nRedwing Mine (20022025)\n\nOctober 2002: Metallon CorporationacquiresRedwing Mine from Lonmin.
