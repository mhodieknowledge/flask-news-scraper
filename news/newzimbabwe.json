            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nGIFFORD Sibanda, the Ibhetshu LikaZulu spokesperson, has resigned from the once vibrant pressure group following revelations that Secretary General Mbuso Fuzwayo is now working hand in glove with Zanu PF to ensure President Emmerson Mnangagwas ambitions for a term extension are realised.\n\nThe group, which in the past was declared a public enemy with some of its members arrested and locked up for standing up to the Zanu PF government, is the second applicant in a Constitutional Court application veiled as an attempt to stop Mnangagwas 2030 plan.\n\nSengezo Tshabangus lawyer, Nqobile Sithole and Method Ndlovu are representing Fuzwayo and Ibhetshu LikaZulu.\n\nAccording to reports, Sibandas resignation emanates from knowledge that Fuzwayo has been tasked to challenge the illegal attempts to have Mnangagwa hang on, and lose.\n\nThis will thereby open avenues for Zanu PFs resolution to extend his second term actionably without any legal hindrances and possible challenges.\n\nThis, however, remains unconfirmed as Fuzwayos number was not going through when NewZimbabwe.com sought to get his comment on the allegations. His WhatsApp number was also not receiving messages.\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that I tender my resignation from Ibhetshu LikaZulu, effective immediately, reads Sibandas letter to Fuzwayo.\n\nThis decision comes after deep reflection on the current direction and approach the organisation has taken in the struggle against Zanu PF.\n\nUnfortunately, I find that this route diverges from my own beliefs, principles, and the foundational values that Ibhetshu LikaZulu has long stood for.\n\nThis is not an easy decision. Ibhetshu LikaZulu has been a home of conscience and courage  a movement that stood firmly with the oppressed and gave voice to the voiceless.\n\nSibanda and Fuzwayo had been comrades in arms for years, in the trenches against first late President Robert Mugabe and his harsh Zanu PF regime to the current.\n\nA resolution by Zanu PF last year mandated the partys secretary for justice to initiate the process that will extend Mnangagwas second and final term, which is supposed to end in 2028. The party wants it lengthened to 2030.\n\nThe involvement of exiled former minister in Mugabes government, Jonathan Moyo, has raised the stakes as he is a known strategist and thinker.\n\nThe resolution, which has threatened to split the revolutionary institution and riddled it with factional fights, was reinforced at its recent Peoples Conference hosted in Mutare.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) says Zimbabwes economy remains highly dollarised, with any de-dollarisation policies needing gradual implementation while the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries has called for further disinflation strategies into 2026 to correct pricing and manage stubbornly high inflation.\n\nZimbabwe is pushing for an end to the use of US Dollars across the economy by 2030, coinciding with a possible two year extension of President Emmerson Mnangagwas rule originally scheduled to end in 2028. Mnangagwas party, Zanu PF party has resolved to extend the Zimbabwean leaders tenure and to end dollarisation by 2030.\n\nHowever, the IMF has said in an interview that Zimbabwe remains highly dollarized with any confidence in a local currency needing to be built through credible fiscal and monetary policies, a strengthened FX market, and the absence of quasi-fiscal operations such as providing subsidies or financing government programsoutside of the budgetframework.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) local currency Zimbabwe says is backed by foreign currency reserves is largely shunned by locals for transactions. The IMF said Zimbabwe has to ringfence any de-dollarisation efforts by a stable policy environment that will accrue confidence for the local unit of exchange.\n\nConfidence in macro-economic policy and the currency is reinforced by a predictable, rules-based policy environment and progress on economic governance.Advancing these reformsalongside clear, consistent economic policy implementationwould help anchor expectations and bolster confidence, the IMFs chief of mission to Zimbabwe,Wojciech Stanislaw Maliszewski, said by email.\n\nThe Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) has called for further disinflation strategies over the next few months. It argued that inflation should be lowered further.\n\nAn inflation rate of 30% is still too high, calling for more disinflation strategies into 2026.The policy target is to have an annual ZiG inflation of 30% by December 2025, said Cornelius Dube, chief economist for the CZI.\n\nAccording to the IMF, theReserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ)has been tighteningits policy stancesince September last year afterhalting monetary financing. This had helpedtolower inflationfrom elevated highs while also easingexchange-rate pressures.\n\nThe gap between official and parallel market rates narrowed, and ZiG inflation declined by mid-2025, though the economy remains highly dollarized, said Maliszewski.\n\nFor the month of October, Zimbabwes inflation in ZiG local currency dropped to32.7%aftershedding 50 percentage points from a rate of 82.7% in the month of September 2025. on the other hand, the USD month-on-month inflation for October 2025 increased to 0.3% from a rate of 0% in the month of September2025.11.4\n\nThe CZI has explained that thismeansthatprices in USD terms remained stable as the observed increase is minimal.\n\nHowever, CZI believes that when the de-dollarisation programme gets rolled out, the inflation differential between ZiG and USD will matter in the decision of which currency to usein transactions.\n\nUSD price stability would make the USD attractive as both a transaction and savings currency. ZiG stability has to be sustainable for a very long time before it can also be considered a close substitute to the USD, said Dube.\n\nThis comes as ZimbabwesUSD year-on-year inflationhas continued on adeclining trend which started in July 2025.\n\nIn October 2025,ZimbabwesUSD inflation declined to 13% fromthe13.4% registered in the month of September. However, a 13% USD inflation is still very high, as it means that savings in USD lost about 13% purchasing power between October 2024 and October 2025, said the CZI.\n\nWith the USD being the main savings currency, it is critical for its inflation to remain very low if savings are to be protected.\n\n",

Unfortunately, after a rise in visitor numbers and repeated vandalism attempts, including people trying to push it over or deface it, access had to be restricted, said Mangwana in a post on X.\n\nHe added that government is now working on measures to reopen access to the statue.\n\nTo enable safe public viewing of the Mbuya Nehanda statue, while protecting the iconic monument, the government is creating a new access framework. The President has instructed that this be implemented as soon as possible. We take this opportunity to apologize to the public for the delayed access, he said.\n\nMangwanas response follows criticism after international travel vlogger Davud Akhundzada was denied access to the statue during a recent visit.\n\nAuthorities came under fire for missing an opportunity to market Zimbabwes capital city.\n\nIn a statement, the Ministry of Tourism and Hospitality Industry distanced itself from the incident, saying responsibility for the monument lies with the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage.\n\nWe wish to clarify that the Mbuya Nehanda Statue is a National Heritage Monument managed by the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage. It stands as a proud symbol of Zimbabwes liberation history and identity.\n\nThe site is subject to specific preservation and security protocols and as such, public access to certain areas, including elevated or restricted zones, may be limited for safety, preservation and security reasons.\n\nHowever, as the Ministry of Tourism and Hospitality Industry, we are taking proactive steps to enhance tourist management at such sites. Through a Whole-of-Government Approach Strategy, in coordination with our counterparts at the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage, we are in the process of deploying tourism officers at key heritage and cultural monuments. These officers will facilitate seamless, well-informed and welcoming access for tourists, ensuring a positive experience while safeguarding our national heritage, read the statement.\n\n",
