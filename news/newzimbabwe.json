Thanks to the proximity and swift response of the City of Harare Fire Brigade, aided by smooth traffic flow, the blaze was contained before it could spread to other traders.Property destroyed includes grinders, fridges, drills, plumbing tools, and various electrical goods, including computers.According to the Mbare Magaba Informal Traders Chairperson, Christopher Makopa, the estimated value of the destroyed property is around US$15,000, Ngadziore said in a statement Saturday.In October last year, another fire broke out at Mbare Musika, in the vegetable section, where goods worth millions of dollars were lost. It was declared a state of disaster by President Emmerson Mnangagwa.The City of Harare says it has plans to install fire hydrants and implement other fire prevention measures to avoid similar incidents in the future.Recently, through the SMEs Committee, we resolved to implement measures to address such cases. Plans are already underway to redesign the MagabaSiya So area to incorporate fire hydrants and introduce other essential fire prevention systems.We also resolved to address issues related to lease agreements and monthly payments to council. This will be done through engagement with representatives of the Magaba traders, said Ngadziore.\n\nThe cause of the fire is not yet known.\n\nCity of Harares Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) Committee chairperson, Councillor Denford Ngadziore, said about 15 traders were affected.A fire broke out in the Magaba area of Mbare, causing significant damage to SME traders.

This act of faith led to a miraculous catch.The power of Gods word lies in its ability to transcend human understanding. Its not about conventional or scientific logic or reason; its about trusting in the One who speaks.As Romans 1:17 says, The just shall live by faith. Faith is the language of Gods operation, and its the only way to please Him (Hebrews 11:6).Jesus emphasises the importance of faith in Mark 11:22-24. He tells His disciples to have faith in God and assures them that whatever they ask for in prayer, believing theyll receive it, will be theirs. This is not just a suggestion; its a command. Jesus wants us to trust Him completely, without questioning His ways.But how do we develop this kind of faith? The answer lies in Gods word. As Psalm 119:160 says, The entirety of Your word is truth. We must immerse ourselves in Scripture, allowing its truth to transform our minds and hearts. We must learn to trust Gods word, even when it seems foolish or contradictory to our scientific knowledge or circumstances.So, lets approach Gods word with faith, not questioning its logic or reasonableness. Lets talk to Him through His word and prayer, trusting that He will guide us and bless us. Lets cast our nets deeper into the waters of Gods blessings, trusting in His word and His faithfulness.As we close, remember that faith is not a feeling; its a choice. Choose to trust Gods word today, and watch Him work miracles in your life.PRAYER:Dear Heavenly Father, we thank You for the power of Your word. Help us to trust in You, even when Your ways seem foolish to us. Give us the faith to take You at Your word, and may we experience the miraculous blessings that come from obeying Your instructions. May Your word be our guide, our comfort, and our strength.

            "content": "By IOL\n\nDISCOVERING that both her children were deaf, Nayantra Kanaye felt as if she was mourning the loss of a loved one.However, the 70-year-old deputy president of the KZN Blind and Deaf Society, and a former teacher, said despite the first years being the most difficult, she knew she needed to do everything possible to ensure they had a bright future.In addition, Kanaye, of Mount Edgecombe, has made a difference to the lives of others, who are also deaf, through various programmes during her career and volunteerism.ChildhoodKanaye, the second youngest of eight children, was born and raised in Riverside, Durban North. Her family moved to Chatsworth in 1966 due to the Group Areas Act.I had one of the best childhoods  growing up in a home filled with love and happiness. We were also quite a large family, and our extended family visited us often. My cousins were always at our home during the holidays.We also lived in a closed-knit community where everyone knew one another. My dad, Moolchand Badal, was involved in community work and was a founding member of the Friends of the Sick Association. I remember going with him to visit families in the community at the weekend.I also remember watching the Japanese Gardens being built. We played around the area, not realising that people would soon be losing their homes. However, we were among the last families to be moved. My dad fought alongside other residents against this. They fought long and hard  until we had no choice but to leave, she said.EducationKanaye said she completed Standard 5 (Grade 7) at the Sir Kurma Reddy State aided Indian School, before the family moved to Chatsworth.The school was across the road from my home. It was not only our place for learning, but also a venue for all community activities such as sporting events and plays.The school was also quite full with limited classrooms. Over the years, I remember there were times when we had our lessons under a tree or at our local temple. The classes held at the temple were the most exciting as I got to walk a distance away from my home and chat to my friends. Whenever there were festivals at the temple, we also got to enjoy the food, she said.Kanaye said she completed Standard 6 at a primary school in Chatsworth, and then attended Standard 7 at the Chatsworth Number Seven High School in Westcliff.We were moved to Havenside, which did not have a high school at the time.

He passed away from Covid-19 in August 2020.Kanaye said shortly after getting married, she fell pregnant with her daughter, Divashya, now 48, and about a year-and-a-half later with her son, Sharvedh, now 46.After marriage, we moved to Verulam due to my husbands work. I began teaching at a school. However, I left work when I was about six months pregnant with my daughter as I was quite ill. I enjoyed being at home with my children. They were healthy and were reaching their milestones. I would never have thought what would come next.Divashya must have been about a year-and-a-half when we realised something was not right. She was playing with the TV remote and had turned the volume on full, but did not react. My husband and I took her to a specialist, who confirmed she was deaf, she said.Kanaye before discovering that both her children were deafKanaye said at that time, she and her husband felt as if their world had come crashing down.We were distraught. We didnt know any people, especially those who were role-models that were deaf. We only knew those from the charities we assisted. I was mourning as if I lost a loved one, but it was in fact for my childrens future.We then went to Cape Town to get a second opinion, and attend a programme on how to deal with a deaf child, including communication skills. We were encouraged to talk to our children so they could be vocal. I was told to teach my child, who was profoundly deaf, how to speak, and not use sign language  which would make her lazy.At the end of the programme, I was approached by the doctor who said I should also test my son. He was just a few months old, but I did it. He, too, was confirmed to be deaf. I had to take in all of this information, but still remain composed for the sake of my children. But all I wanted to do was cry, she said.Return to teachingKanaye said she joined the VN Naik School for the Deaf in 1984.Both my children were attending the school and I was quite the active parent  assisting where I could. So when the principal offered me a job, I accepted. The school had also introduced sign language, which I wasnt too keen about as I kept thinking about the professionals who said it was for low-functioning persons. They always said that success meant a child who could vocalise themselves. However, I soon realised that was not so.I remember there was a young man, who was deaf, but was working in one of the departments at a university. I thought to myself, he is deaf but a professional. He came to the school to speak about sign language . After that, I can say he made me completely change my mind about it.Moving abroadKanaye said to give her children the opportunity to further their education, she decided to pursue her Masters degree in the US.My husband and I wanted to make sure they had every opportunity to enable them to become independent. We were not going to let anything hold them back, and that meant also furthering their education. However, at the time there were no tertiary institutions for the deaf in South Africa.It so happened that the principal and a teacher at the school had gone to the US to attend Gallaudet University in Washington DC  which is the worlds leading institution for the deaf and hard of hearing.

Prior to this, I had completed a diploma in special education, and a degree in English and psychology, both through Unisa.I also applied for Divashya to be enrolled in the pre-college programme, and for Sharvedh to complete his high school  which was also offered on the universitys campus. This would give them the opportunity to thereafter study at the university, she said.Kanaye said after completing the degree, she taught English to foreign deaf students at the university.I needed to stay another year as my son needed to still complete his final year of high school.At the time, he was my dependant, and would have to return to South Africa with me if I left. So I worked for that year.Kanaye said she returned to South Africa while her children completed their degrees at the university.Divashya completed a BSc in accounting and she graduated magna cum laude. She is currently a professional accountant.Sharvedh completed a BSc in economics and science. He currently lives in the US and works as an analyst in a department of the federal government.In those early days, I cried over my childrens future.

Prior to this, I had completed a diploma in special education, and a degree in English and psychology, both through Unisa.I also applied for Divashya to be enrolled in the pre-college programme, and for Sharvedh to complete his high school  which was also offered on the universitys campus.

We didnt know any people, especially those who were role-models that were deaf. We only knew those from the charities we assisted. I was mourning as if I lost a loved one, but it was in fact for my childrens future.\n\nWe then went to Cape Town to get a second opinion, and attend a programme on how to deal with a deaf child, including communication skills. We were encouraged to talk to our children so they could be vocal. I was told to teach my child, who was profoundly deaf, how to speak, and not use sign language  which would make her lazy.At the end of the programme, I was approached by the doctor who said I should also test my son. He was just a few months old, but I did it. He, too, was confirmed to be deaf. I had to take in all of this information, but still remain composed for the sake of my children.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZIM dancehall artist Jimmy Mudereri, also known as Silent Killer, is facing a demand for US$122,170 from Y2K Entertainment, the organisers of the UK SAMA Festival, following his failure to attend the event in April 2025.\n\nSilent killer, missed the festival after refusing to board a flight, citing a troubling dream about an airplane explosion.Despite checking in at Robert Mugabe International Airport, he backed out at the last minute, the event organisers bought a second flight ticket costing $1,500, but he locked himself in a toilet to avoid boarding.Y2K Entertainment claims that Silent Killer breached his performance contract, resulting in significant financial losses and reputational damage.The festival was scheduled for 19 and 20 April, 2025.In a letter of demand gleaned by NewZimbabwe.com, Y2K allege that they incurred substantial expenses, including cost of three airfare tickets and various payments made to facilitate his travel and Visa application.It is alleged that your client brazenly breached the terms of the contract, displayed unprofessional conduct in many ways; especially by his none attendance and failure to fulfill his contractual obligations causing huge financial loss and reputational damage to our clients.The brief circumstances and our clients case against yours can be crystalised as follows; a. Client alleges that they sent Silent Killer US$300 to enable him to obtain an emergency passport sometime in 2024.Our clients allege that they incurred huge financial loses as a result of your clients alleged unprofessional conduct. Clients had to buy Silent Killer a total of three air plane tickets to the United Kingdom. It is alleged that your client caused the delay in the application for his Visa; he had not disclosed to our clients that his passport had been held somewhere because he allegedly owed about US$580. It was through clients agents efforts that the passport was subsequently retrieved after client had sent US$500, which Silent Killer allegedly pocketed.Clients allege that it was extremely difficult to get Silent Killer to cooperate and attend the Visa application interview. It is alleged that Silent Killer even arrived late for the first Visa application interview and clients had to book him a second interview, all at their expense.Due to the late interviews, Silent Killers Visa only came out on the day he was scheduled to fly to the United Kingdom but it was now too late hence why he could not board the first scheduled plane. Clients went on to buy two other air plane ticket for Silent Killer and he still failed to honor his contractual obligations.According to the performance contract agreement, it was agreed by both parties that Silent Killer would be given an initial deposit of US$500 prior to his departure to the United Kingdom. Upon arrival in the United Kingdom, Silent Killer was to be given his outstanding balance of US$2,000 to make a total of US$2,500 as per the terms of their agreement.Clients allege that Silent Killer was given the agreed initial deposit of US$500 and several other sums of monies which were to be deducted from the US$2,000, which he was meant to be given upon arrival in the United Kingdom. We have been shown a video footage wherein Silent Killer was acknowledging to Mr Fred Matenga that he had been given the US$500 initial deposit as per their agreement, which he was flagging on camera. Your client in the same video footage confirmed the material terms of their agreement as outlined above as regards the agreed payment terms.We are instructed by our clients that notwithstanding the above, upon arrival at RG Mugabe Airport on 18 April 2025, your client, after our clients agent had checked him in; subsequently refused to disembark the car and board the initial 3pm flight that had been booked for him. He was left by the plane after he refused to come out of the car at RG Mugabe Airport.It is alleged that upon arrival at the airport your client had started making a fresh demand of a US$300 payment which he alleged he wanted to leave with his girlfriend or wife. Notwithstanding the fact that this demand was outside their agreed terms and contract, client sent the US300 to one Diva who was with Silent Killer and had been the middle men between the parties. But still he refused to disembark the car, board the plane and was left by the plane knowing fully well how his actions were further prejudicing our clients and the grave consequences that would ensue. The US$300 was however subsequently sent back to our client after Silent Killer failed to board the plane.It is further alleged that your client asked our clients to book him another flight after giving them the impression that he was remorseful for his conduct and was desirous to honor his contractual obligations. Clients proceeded to book yours another ticket for a 6pm flight on the same day.Client alleges that even after buying a second air ticket, Silent Killer made a new further demand for another payment outside their agreed contract terms. It is alleged he first made an unreasonable and startling demand for the money which he said was due to his DJ, who was never a party to the contract and was not travelling with him to the UK. Upon realising that this demand was opposed and could not be entertained, it is alleged that Silent Killer then started arguing that clients should not have booked him a 6pm flight but a Saturday morning 1am flight instead.It is further alleged that Silent Killer then started claiming that he would never board the 6pm plane because he had had a dream whereby the plane had exploded. Clients further allege that instead of going to check in so as to board the 6pm flight, Silent Killer was invited and chose to go and eat food at a restaurant within the RG Mugabe Airport and once again failed to check in and was left by the second plane on 18 April 2025, reads the letter.As a result of silent killers failure to perform, the organisers said they had to find a last-minute replacement artist, Oriyano, leading to additional expenses and a diminished audience turnout.As a result of your clients failure to board the plane to the United Kingdom, our clients had to make an alternative, unplanned arrangement to rope in Oriyano to come on board as he was in the United Kingdom at the material time. Clients had to pay Oriyano for his performance.Clients show had a lesser attendance due to Silent Killers none attendance. Silent Killers fans chose to not attend the event in protest and client lost potential revenue.Further to that, it is alleged that your client went on to make several misleading, damaging allegations against our clients in his podcast interview; which allegations have caused our clients serious reputational damage. Their good names and brand has been dealt a fatal blow as a result of the alleged disinformation by your client.For the record, your client had been given more than the US$500 which he was supposed to have been given before he boarded the plane to the United Kingdom as per the performance agreement with contract. Your client had received and withdrew in advance a total of US$1,500 before he even left Zimbabwe, reads the letter.Y2K Entertainment has instructed silent killer to pay the full amount of US$122,170 for the damages he made, and to be paid within seven days, failing which they will pursue legal action.It is against this background that clients have instructed us to write this letter of demand. Clients have instructed us to demand from your client;a. damages for soiling clients reputation b. compensation for the breach of contract and none performance of contractual obligations by your client c. reimbursement of all monies advanced to your client and used for airplane ticket purchases.For the record, we are instructed by our client that the breakdown of the amount being claimed is as follows;US$300 given to Silent Killer for an emergency passport last year, 2024.US$500 deposit given to Silent Killer as per the terms of their performance contract agreement.US$500 given to Silent Killer to collect or recover his passport from the lodge /guest house.US$100 given to Silent Killer for maintenance when he claimed he had been arrested for defaulting maintenance.US$100-00 given to Silent Killer to attend Visa application biometrics.GBP 1273.40/US$ $1,693.62 for initial ticket which was later changed due to late submission of passport by Silent Killer and late visa application.GBP 435.00/ USD$578.55 being the cost for ticket itinerary changes.GBP 1534.00 / USD $2,040.22 being the new ticket purchase after the no show-Ethiopian airlines ticket.A total of 4,500/ USD $5,985 paid to the replacement artist Oriyano (2500) and his promoter (2000).Accommodation 280/ US$$372.40.Loss of income due none appearance by Silent Killer US$10,000.Damage to Y2K and Fred Matenga US$100,000.We are instructed by our client to demand, as we hereby do; that you pay the sum of USD122, 170 (One hundred and Twenty-two thousand one hundred and seventy United States Dollars) which amount is now due to our client and must be paid within seven (7) days of being served with this letter. You are also further expected to pay US$12, 217 (Twelve Thousand Two Hundred and seventeen United Stated dollars) being our collection commission.Now therefore, in accordance with our clients instruction, this therefore serves as FORMAL NOTICE that you MUST settle the amount due at our offices that is Office No. 10, 3D Complex Centre, Strathaven Shops, Harare in the next seven (7) calendar days; and failure to pay will result in summons being issued against you without further reference to you. In that event all costs of recovery shall be on your account. We however hope that this shall not be necessary, reads the letter.\n\nSilent killer, missed the festival after refusing to board a flight, citing a troubling dream about an airplane explosion.\n\nDespite checking in at Robert Mugabe International Airport, he backed out at the last minute, the event organisers bought a second flight ticket costing $1,500, but he locked himself in a toilet to avoid boarding.Y2K Entertainment claims that Silent Killer breached his performance contract, resulting in significant financial losses and reputational damage.The festival was scheduled for 19 and 20 April, 2025.In a letter of demand gleaned by NewZimbabwe.com, Y2K allege that they incurred substantial expenses, including cost of three airfare tickets and various payments made to facilitate his travel and Visa application.It is alleged that your client brazenly breached the terms of the contract, displayed unprofessional conduct in many ways; especially by his none attendance and failure to fulfill his contractual obligations causing huge financial loss and reputational damage to our clients.The brief circumstances and our clients case against yours can be crystalised as follows; a.

Client alleges that they sent Silent Killer US$300 to enable him to obtain an emergency passport sometime in 2024.Our clients allege that they incurred huge financial loses as a result of your clients alleged unprofessional conduct. Clients had to buy Silent Killer a total of three air plane tickets to the United Kingdom. It is alleged that your client caused the delay in the application for his Visa; he had not disclosed to our clients that his passport had been held somewhere because he allegedly owed about US$580. It was through clients agents efforts that the passport was subsequently retrieved after client had sent US$500, which Silent Killer allegedly pocketed.Clients allege that it was extremely difficult to get Silent Killer to cooperate and attend the Visa application interview. It is alleged that Silent Killer even arrived late for the first Visa application interview and clients had to book him a second interview, all at their expense.Due to the late interviews, Silent Killers Visa only came out on the day he was scheduled to fly to the United Kingdom but it was now too late hence why he could not board the first scheduled plane. Clients went on to buy two other air plane ticket for Silent Killer and he still failed to honor his contractual obligations.According to the performance contract agreement, it was agreed by both parties that Silent Killer would be given an initial deposit of US$500 prior to his departure to the United Kingdom. Upon arrival in the United Kingdom, Silent Killer was to be given his outstanding balance of US$2,000 to make a total of US$2,500 as per the terms of their agreement.Clients allege that Silent Killer was given the agreed initial deposit of US$500 and several other sums of monies which were to be deducted from the US$2,000, which he was meant to be given upon arrival in the United Kingdom. We have been shown a video footage wherein Silent Killer was acknowledging to Mr Fred Matenga that he had been given the US$500 initial deposit as per their agreement, which he was flagging on camera. Your client in the same video footage confirmed the material terms of their agreement as outlined above as regards the agreed payment terms.We are instructed by our clients that notwithstanding the above, upon arrival at RG Mugabe Airport on 18 April 2025, your client, after our clients agent had checked him in; subsequently refused to disembark the car and board the initial 3pm flight that had been booked for him. He was left by the plane after he refused to come out of the car at RG Mugabe Airport.It is alleged that upon arrival at the airport your client had started making a fresh demand of a US$300 payment which he alleged he wanted to leave with his girlfriend or wife. Notwithstanding the fact that this demand was outside their agreed terms and contract, client sent the US300 to one Diva who was with Silent Killer and had been the middle men between the parties. But still he refused to disembark the car, board the plane and was left by the plane knowing fully well how his actions were further prejudicing our clients and the grave consequences that would ensue. The US$300 was however subsequently sent back to our client after Silent Killer failed to board the plane.It is further alleged that your client asked our clients to book him another flight after giving them the impression that he was remorseful for his conduct and was desirous to honor his contractual obligations. Clients proceeded to book yours another ticket for a 6pm flight on the same day.Client alleges that even after buying a second air ticket, Silent Killer made a new further demand for another payment outside their agreed contract terms. It is alleged he first made an unreasonable and startling demand for the money which he said was due to his DJ, who was never a party to the contract and was not travelling with him to the UK. Upon realising that this demand was opposed and could not be entertained, it is alleged that Silent Killer then started arguing that clients should not have booked him a 6pm flight but a Saturday morning 1am flight instead.It is further alleged that Silent Killer then started claiming that he would never board the 6pm plane because he had had a dream whereby the plane had exploded. Clients further allege that instead of going to check in so as to board the 6pm flight, Silent Killer was invited and chose to go and eat food at a restaurant within the RG Mugabe Airport and once again failed to check in and was left by the second plane on 18 April 2025, reads the letter.As a result of silent killers failure to perform, the organisers said they had to find a last-minute replacement artist, Oriyano, leading to additional expenses and a diminished audience turnout.As a result of your clients failure to board the plane to the United Kingdom, our clients had to make an alternative, unplanned arrangement to rope in Oriyano to come on board as he was in the United Kingdom at the material time. Clients had to pay Oriyano for his performance.Clients show had a lesser attendance due to Silent Killers none attendance.

In that event all costs of recovery shall be on your account. We however hope that this shall not be necessary, reads the letter.\n\nThe brief circumstances and our clients case against yours can be crystalised as follows; a. Client alleges that they sent Silent Killer US$300 to enable him to obtain an emergency passport sometime in 2024.\n\nOur clients allege that they incurred huge financial loses as a result of your clients alleged unprofessional conduct. Clients had to buy Silent Killer a total of three air plane tickets to the United Kingdom. It is alleged that your client caused the delay in the application for his Visa; he had not disclosed to our clients that his passport had been held somewhere because he allegedly owed about US$580. It was through clients agents efforts that the passport was subsequently retrieved after client had sent US$500, which Silent Killer allegedly pocketed.Clients allege that it was extremely difficult to get Silent Killer to cooperate and attend the Visa application interview. It is alleged that Silent Killer even arrived late for the first Visa application interview and clients had to book him a second interview, all at their expense.Due to the late interviews, Silent Killers Visa only came out on the day he was scheduled to fly to the United Kingdom but it was now too late hence why he could not board the first scheduled plane. Clients went on to buy two other air plane ticket for Silent Killer and he still failed to honor his contractual obligations.According to the performance contract agreement, it was agreed by both parties that Silent Killer would be given an initial deposit of US$500 prior to his departure to the United Kingdom. Upon arrival in the United Kingdom, Silent Killer was to be given his outstanding balance of US$2,000 to make a total of US$2,500 as per the terms of their agreement.Clients allege that Silent Killer was given the agreed initial deposit of US$500 and several other sums of monies which were to be deducted from the US$2,000, which he was meant to be given upon arrival in the United Kingdom. We have been shown a video footage wherein Silent Killer was acknowledging to Mr Fred Matenga that he had been given the US$500 initial deposit as per their agreement, which he was flagging on camera. Your client in the same video footage confirmed the material terms of their agreement as outlined above as regards the agreed payment terms.We are instructed by our clients that notwithstanding the above, upon arrival at RG Mugabe Airport on 18 April 2025, your client, after our clients agent had checked him in; subsequently refused to disembark the car and board the initial 3pm flight that had been booked for him. He was left by the plane after he refused to come out of the car at RG Mugabe Airport.It is alleged that upon arrival at the airport your client had started making a fresh demand of a US$300 payment which he alleged he wanted to leave with his girlfriend or wife. Notwithstanding the fact that this demand was outside their agreed terms and contract, client sent the US300 to one Diva who was with Silent Killer and had been the middle men between the parties. But still he refused to disembark the car, board the plane and was left by the plane knowing fully well how his actions were further prejudicing our clients and the grave consequences that would ensue. The US$300 was however subsequently sent back to our client after Silent Killer failed to board the plane.It is further alleged that your client asked our clients to book him another flight after giving them the impression that he was remorseful for his conduct and was desirous to honor his contractual obligations. Clients proceeded to book yours another ticket for a 6pm flight on the same day.Client alleges that even after buying a second air ticket, Silent Killer made a new further demand for another payment outside their agreed contract terms. It is alleged he first made an unreasonable and startling demand for the money which he said was due to his DJ, who was never a party to the contract and was not travelling with him to the UK. Upon realising that this demand was opposed and could not be entertained, it is alleged that Silent Killer then started arguing that clients should not have booked him a 6pm flight but a Saturday morning 1am flight instead.It is further alleged that Silent Killer then started claiming that he would never board the 6pm plane because he had had a dream whereby the plane had exploded. Clients further allege that instead of going to check in so as to board the 6pm flight, Silent Killer was invited and chose to go and eat food at a restaurant within the RG Mugabe Airport and once again failed to check in and was left by the second plane on 18 April 2025, reads the letter.As a result of silent killers failure to perform, the organisers said they had to find a last-minute replacement artist, Oriyano, leading to additional expenses and a diminished audience turnout.As a result of your clients failure to board the plane to the United Kingdom, our clients had to make an alternative, unplanned arrangement to rope in Oriyano to come on board as he was in the United Kingdom at the material time. Clients had to pay Oriyano for his performance.Clients show had a lesser attendance due to Silent Killers none attendance. Silent Killers fans chose to not attend the event in protest and client lost potential revenue.Further to that, it is alleged that your client went on to make several misleading, damaging allegations against our clients in his podcast interview; which allegations have caused our clients serious reputational damage.

We have been shown a video footage wherein Silent Killer was acknowledging to Mr Fred Matenga that he had been given the US$500 initial deposit as per their agreement, which he was flagging on camera.

But still he refused to disembark the car, board the plane and was left by the plane knowing fully well how his actions were further prejudicing our clients and the grave consequences that would ensue. The US$300 was however subsequently sent back to our client after Silent Killer failed to board the plane.It is further alleged that your client asked our clients to book him another flight after giving them the impression that he was remorseful for his conduct and was desirous to honor his contractual obligations.

It is alleged he first made an unreasonable and startling demand for the money which he said was due to his DJ, who was never a party to the contract and was not travelling with him to the UK. Upon realising that this demand was opposed and could not be entertained, it is alleged that Silent Killer then started arguing that clients should not have booked him a 6pm flight but a Saturday morning 1am flight instead.It is further alleged that Silent Killer then started claiming that he would never board the 6pm plane because he had had a dream whereby the plane had exploded. Clients further allege that instead of going to check in so as to board the 6pm flight, Silent Killer was invited and chose to go and eat food at a restaurant within the RG Mugabe Airport and once again failed to check in and was left by the second plane on 18 April 2025, reads the letter.As a result of silent killers failure to perform, the organisers said they had to find a last-minute replacement artist, Oriyano, leading to additional expenses and a diminished audience turnout.As a result of your clients failure to board the plane to the United Kingdom, our clients had to make an alternative, unplanned arrangement to rope in Oriyano to come on board as he was in the United Kingdom at the material time.

Police tried to stop it but sped off and got stuck in the sand.When members of SAPS confronted the white Toyota Corolla Cross, two men alighted from the vehicle and ran onto the Zimbabwean side of the border.Two men alighted from the vehicle and ran onto the border side of Zimbabwe, evading an arrest.Preliminary investigations by the South African Police Service have so far revealed that the white vehicle belongs to a private company in South Africa.However, police said the vehicle had not been reported as stolen. The Toyota Corolla Cross was immediately impounded at the scene.Meanwhile, provincial commissioner of police in Limpopo, Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe has applauded the swift reaction by the police in the ongoing fight against smuggling of stolen motor vehicles across the province.Last year, IOL reported that the Mokopane Regional Court in Limpopo sentenced 46-year-old Vusi Vincent Moloka to seven years direct imprisonment for possession of a stolen vehicle, which was heading to Limpopo.At the time, Ledwaba said on March 20 2024, at around 6pm, the South African Police Service received information about a stolen Toyota Fortuner with Gauteng registration numberplates travelling from Sandton to Limpopo via the N1 North.Vusi Vincent Moloka was sentenced to seven years in jail after he was found a stolen Toyota Fortuner from Gauteng to Limpopo.A lookout was issued, and with assistance from Spoorvat and Reflex private security companies, Ledwaba said the wanted vehicle was spotted on the N1 freeway.The driver attempted to flee but was later arrested in Modimolle with the stolen vehicles keys in his possession, Ledwaba said.The case was transferred to the Modimolle Vehicle Crime Investigation Unit (VCIU) and allocated to Detective Sergeant Mpedi Ngoepe, who ensured a watertight case and successfully opposed bail.\n\nPolice spokesperson, Colonel Malesela Ledwaba, said the sport utility vehicle was about to be smuggled out of South Africa through an illegal crossing in the Limpopo River.\n\nPolice received intelligence information about the vehicle that was driven along Malales Drift heading to the banks of the Limpopo River and operationalised on it, he said.At about 6am, the vehicle fitting the description was spotted in the bushes while attempting to cross the Limpopo river to Zimbabwe.

We have just had one of our beloved Rhino shot today. He was brutally massacred by poachers for greed.Gomo was the backbone of black rhino conservation on Imire. He has given so much to Imire, its people, its community, to the children of Zimbabwe.People have had the most incredible experiences with this Rhino and today we mourn the death of this rhino, Travers said.There is a global demand for rhino horns, fuelled by myths about their medicinal benefits, and this is one of the factors exacerbating poaching activities.Travers also appealed to the public to help in protecting the remaining endangered species.We are going to stand together and fight for what is right because if we dont, we wont have these species on this planet.Everyday we are losing this battle, so my plea to you, let us stand together, unite, educate, inspire to protect what we have remaining. We only have got islands, little pockets of wildlife left in Africa and it is up to us to protect them, he added.Meanwhile opposition politician Fadzayi Mahere challenged authorities to act demanding a thorough investigation from police.Hopefully, those responsible for this egregious, criminal act will be held accountable by police.Rhinos are an endangered species so all hands must be on deck to ensure theyre preserved at all costs.Where is the Minister of Environment? What steps will be taken to investigate? Does the government even care or is it complicit? Mahere wrote on her official X account.Speaking to NewZimbabwe.com, wildlife conservationist Ignatious Kudakwashe Maeresa, Executive Director of Earth Co-Existence Initiative (ECI) said the nation has lost not only the monetary value but also ecological value that Gomo brought.It is disheartening considering that there are a lot of efforts invested in protecting and conserving rhinos.As a country, we have not only lost just in terms of monetary value only, but we have also lost in terms of ecological value as well.Rhinos are also identified as keystones species, which means they bring a lot of value to an environment where they will be habiting, Maeresa said.Black rhinos in Zimbabwe are listed as endangered species, and there is an extinction risk if conservation efforts are not intensified.Meanwhile, a Chinese company, Sunny Ye Feng, recently proposed a coal mining project in Sinamatella, a part of Hwange National Park, which is a black rhino habitat.\n\nThe rhino named Gomo was brutally killed for its horn.\n\nSpeaking following the devastating news, Reilly Travers, a conservationist at Imire Rhino and Wildlife Conservation expressed pain and devastation from Gomos death.Imires soul has just been ripped from within.

There is a genuine transition that has to be managed. There is a genuine transition that has to be shepherded. It has to be scaffolded. If it is not scaffolded and shepherded, we are going to go into an implosion, said Biti.\n\nThe former finance minister added that key state institutions are captured and operating at the whims of the governing party, Zanu PF.\n\nWe have had a policy and a polity pillared on the emasculation of State institutions. There is no institution in Zimbabwe that is independent. There is no institution in Zimbabwe that is not an extension of Zanu PFs Politburo.\n\nEvery institutionincluding those that I cannot mention because I am a practicing lawyerevery institution in Zimbabwe has been captured and captured thoroughly, said Biti.\n\nZanu PF has been accused of spreading its influence over constitutional institutions, which has led to the erosion of democratic spaces such as elections, Parliament, and the judiciary.\n\nThe governing party has also been fingered in the collapse of the opposition, following last years split of the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), with Tshabangu leading the charge in the decimation of the opposition.\n\nAccording to observers, the dearth of opposition has allowed the government to operate without checks and balances.\n\nBiti said the NTA should initiate an all-encompassing dialogue.\n\nThe sum collection of this is that we have a crisis that needs to be managed to avoid an implosion. That is where the NTA comes in. The NTA is an idea that is anchored on dialogue.\n\nThe citizens of Zimbabwe must talk and dialogue, where the first process has to be a national conference. The convention must articulate issues that speak to Zimbabwes fragility and vulnerability, and these issues must be put on the table, said Biti.\n\n",

Colonel Christian M. Katsande, Zimbabwes Ambassador to the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland, and to have the privilege of hosting the Zimbabwe National Cricket Team as our distinguished guests.\n\nShe added; Attendees can expect an inspiring evening of networking, cultural pride, and engagement with members of the Zimbabwe national cricket team and key figures from the diaspora.\n\nAsDiaspora Insurance, we see this as more than a reception  its a moment to honour identity, foster unity, and showcase the positive impact Zimbabweans are making globally.\n\nIts a privilege to stand with our national heroes and celebrate Zimbabwean excellence on and off the pitch. This reception is a testament to the strength and pride of the diaspora community  and to the shared identity that continues to unite us across borders.\n\nThe fast-growing company, which now covers 20 African nationalities across the world, recently hosted the Zimbabwe Football Association leadership and the national team coach during their tour of the UK.\n\nPreviously, the company, which is celebrating its 13thanniversary this year, also hosted a reception for the Zimbabwe national womens netball team, The Gems, during their UK-tour for the Celtic International Series games.\n\nMeanwhile, speaking after their training sessions ahead of the England test, Zimbabwe head coach Justin Sammons said the players were in good spirits. Good day. Obviously, we had a long journey from Harare to Leicestershire.\n\nSo, you know, Sunday was a day off in terms of our recovery. And then today was our first session out in the field and the nets.\n\nI think it was excellent. Just a nice technical session. Guys are ticking their boxes there. So, yeah, happy with the way it went.\n\nThe return to England comes at a time when Zimbabwe are rebuilding their red-ball programme, coming hard on the heels of a hard-fought one-all series draw against Bangladesh.\n\nIts why you play the game. You want to play against the best and, obviously, England are one of the best Test teams in the world, Sammons said. And it gives us a gauge as to where we are and what we need to do moving forward.\n\nBut the guys have a real belief that they belong, and Im looking forward to seeing them go out there with their chests puffed out and walking out there like they do belong in the space.\n\n",
