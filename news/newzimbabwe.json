            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Nurses Association (ZINA) has strongly condemned the governments neglect of a Bikita nurse, Progress Muzuva, who was severely injured while on duty seven years ago, calling her case a tragic example of systemic abandonment of front-line health workers.\n\nShe has since been denied compensation, medical support, and justice by the government for which she worked.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, ZINA president Enock Dongo said Muzuvas case is not an isolated incident and demanded an investigation into the matter.\n\nZINA demands a full investigation into how this matter was handled from the district authorities all the way up to head office.\n\nThose responsible for this neglect must be held accountable. What happened to Nurse Muzuva is not an isolated incident; this is just a drop in the ocean.\n\nAcross Zimbabwe, many nurses are injured while carrying out their duties, some in ambulance accidents while escorting patients, others while lifting immobile patients in wards, Dongo said.\n\nAccording to the nurses association, many health workers get injured on duty and receive no support, treatment, nor compensation.\n\nMany are left to suffer silently in their homes, unable to afford care with the meagre salaries they earn.\n\nThis culture of abandonment is pushing nurses out of the public service and out of the country to search for greener pastures elsewhere.\n\nWe ask again: Who will care for the carers? If the system fails to protect those who risk their lives for patients, then it has failed entirely.\n\nZINA calls on all relevant stakeholders to intervene urgently in Muzuvas case. She must receive immediate medical assistance, financial support, and justice. Her case should set a precedent for change, Dongo added.\n\nMuzuva told this publication that since 2018, the Health Ministry has been refusing to help her from the district level up to the ministers office.\n\nMuzuva was attacked by a violent maternity patientwhom she was escorting to Silveira Hospital in Masvingo for emergency care.\n\nThe violent patient wanted to kill herself and her newborn baby in what medical experts say could have been a case of severe postpartum psychosis.\n\nMuzuva saved the patient and her newly born baby but injured her spine and leg in the process.\n\n",

How does a stone sculpture park help encourage environmental conservation?\n\nIn Harare, Zimbabwes capital, the Chapungu Sculpture Garden offers a unique fusion of art and environmentalconservation. The park is a sanctuary where sculptors carve stone works of art inspired byanimalsand other natural forms. It, in turn is designed to protectnature. Indigenous native species have been planted there to help preserve them. Artist and park manager Nicholas Kadzungura explains that they are threatened bydeforestation. The garden, founded in 1970 and named after the sacred Bateleur Eagle, serves as both a creative hub and a living classroom, where visitors learn aboutZimbabwes rich ecological and cultural heritage.\n\nMany sculptures in the park reflect Zimbabwes environmental challenges. Friend of the Rhino, a piece by the late Joseph Ndandarika, which encourages empathy and the protection ofendangered species. With only around 600 black rhinos left in Zimbabwe, the message is pressing. Marcey Mushore, the parks director, explains how animistic Shona traditions guide conservation efforts. The park also acts as agreen lungfor Hararesurban sprawl. Some 2.4 million people live in its metropolitan area and pollution and disappearing green spaces are a problem.\n\nChapungus artists are committed to sharing ancestral knowledge through sculpture workshops and educational programs. Kadzungura stresses that Zimbabwes traditional stone art is not just decorativeit carries lessons about coexistence with nature. Asclimate changeand urban development threaten the countrys wetlands andbiodiversity, the parks mission is becoming more vital. Chapungu inspires action by blending creativity, tradition, and environmental stewardship.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Labour Court of Zimbabwe has ordered Fidelity Life Assurance and its sister company, Fidelity Funeral Assurance, to pay former employee Nickson Busu a staggering US$271,727.81 in back pay and damages, ending a protracted labour dispute that has spanned more than a decade.\n\nHanding down judgment on 31 July 2025, Justice Makamure ruled that Busu, who was dismissed from employment in July 2013, is entitled to 107 months of unpaid salary, fuel allowances, and 12 months salary as damages in lieu of reinstatement.\n\nWhat this means is that the applicant is entitled to his back pay and benefits.\n\nThese will therefore be granted as prayed.\n\nThe applicant is said to be in his sixties. This appears not to have been disputed by the respondent.\n\nThe chances of him securing alternative employment continue to diminish.\n\nRespondent, on the other hand, simply indicted that the applicant should not get more than 6 months worth of damages. Respondent did not suggest at what rate such damages should be calculated. After assessing the record, including the submissions, it is my considered view that the applicant is entitled to 12 months salary as damages in lieu of reinstatement.\n\nThe applicant is therefore entitled to the following according to his claim, ruled the judge.\n\nBusu, represented by labour lawyer Caleb Mucheche, claimed US$294,396.85 based on a gross monthly salary of US$1,192.00 as reflected in his April 2013 payslip.\n\nFidelity Life had offered damages equivalent to just six months salary, but the court rejected this.\n\nThe case was remitted to the Labour Court for quantification of damages by the Supreme Court under SC597/24, which had earlier confirmed Busus unlawful dismissal and ordered compensation in line with the Labour Act.\n\nBusu argued that he had made reasonable but unsuccessful efforts to secure alternative employment due to age and poor health.\n\nWhile he did not provide specific medical details, the court acknowledged that, at over 60 years old, his chances of re-employment were continuing to diminish.\n\nJustice Makamure cited precedent from Ambali v Bata Shoe Co Ltd 1999(1) ZLR 417 (S), emphasising that although dismissed employees have a duty to mitigate losses by seeking alternative work, employers cannot use that obligation to evade fair compensation.\n\nThe principle that it is the duty of the employer to prove that an employee made efforts to look for employment should not stop a dismissed employee from ensuring that they mitigate their loss, said the judge.\n\nThe breakdown of the court award includes 107 months salary of US$233,348.81, fuel allowance (150 litres/month for 107 months): US$24,075.00 and 12 months salary in lieu of reinstatement: US$14,304.00\n\nThe court ordered Fidelity Life Assurance and Fidelity Funeral Assurance to pay the amount or its equivalent in Zimbabwean dollars using the prevailing official exchange rate on the date of payment.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/zimfest-significance-a-gen-z-second-generation-diaspora-perspective/",
            "content": "By Tariro Mugadza\n\nIts been just over a week since I attended Zimfest, having had my first experience of the festival in 2007 when I was in a pushchair under a year old, and Im already ready to grab tickets for the next one. Alongside the overwhelming joy and warmth this years event left me with, Ive also been carrying a deep sense that I experienced something truly meaningful, something far beyond just having fun. It stirred something within me, strengthening my connection to my roots and heritage. After all, its not every day that I get to be among my people, especially beyond the familiar walls of my home.\n\nThis was my second time inviting non-Zimbabwean friends to Zimfest, and it gifted me with an even deeper appreciation for my culture and heritage. Witnessing their genuine curiosity, enthusiasm, and respect for Zimbabwean culture was profoundly moving. Seeing them light up with joy and admiration for the very things I grew up loving is something I will never forget.\n\nWhether they were drooling over the culinary delights, like chakalaka and boerewors (shoutout to Just James MCR for that delicious lunch!), or captivated by the visual brilliance of Zimbabweans showing up and showing out in style, the day was filled with heart-warming moments and an overwhelming sense of pride.\n\nReflecting on their experience at this years Zimfest, my friends shared some powerful sentiments. Anton, who is UK-born and half-British, half-German, said, Im not even from Zimbabwe, and it made me feel more connected to its culture.Fikunmi, who is Black, Yoruba, and migrated from Nigeria to the UK at the age of three, said, Going to Zimfest allowed me to connect to a culture that wasnt my own, yet I still felt welcomed, like an honorary Zimbabwean.\n\nMy lunch bought from the Just James MCR Stall at Zimfest\n\nFinding a Sense of Identity and Belonging\n\nLiving in the Diaspora, I know firsthand that it is simply not possible to constantly return home or physically engage with your people. This is where festivals like Zimfest step in by providingthe much-needed opportunity to be amongst your people, to fully embrace and express your native identity and to rejoice in a common sense of cultural pride.\n\nHere in the diaspora, the culture I was raised withfrom the daily home-cooked meals to the dcor adorning our walls, from the music blasting during ourgochi gochiand braais in the back garden to the spirited family games of Crazy Eightsdoes not reflect the culture I encounter the moment I step outside my front door.\n\nBack home, stepping out and being surrounded by your own people is part of everyday life. But here, in the diaspora, those moments are rareand therefore deeply precious. This is especially true for those of us who grew up or lived in predominantly white areas, in places weve never truly identified with and perhaps never will. In spaces where, for years and sometimes even now, simply seeing another Black person in town becomes a moment of excitement.\n\nTinaye, a second-generation Zimbabwean migrant who was raised in South Africa and moved to the UK for boarding school at the age of 12, attended Zimfest for the first time this year. She commented: Zimfest is a reminder of how much community you can find in the UK being a Zimbabwean andI find that important as someone who has gone to predominantly white schools.\n\nFor, as a second-generation migrant, I am one with those whom I simply do not have immediate access to. Yet, at Zimfest, there is that precious opportunity to truly feel that strong, unwavering power of unity and Ubuntu as I join with my community.\n\nRuvarashe, a second-generation Zimbabwean migrant born and raised in the UK, commented on Zimfest as a powerful way to connect with my roots. Exploring the distinction between first-generation and second-generation migrants, she stated: While first-generation migrants carry lived memories of home, I often navigate identity through culture, music and community. Zimfest helps bridge that gap by providing a space dedicated to belonging, pride and a deeper understanding of my heritage. Alongside the inherent sense of belonging that comes along with attending Zimfest, there is the more personal, individual aspects of being able to walk around comfortably knowing that I will not stand out or receive looks of fear or judgement simply on the basis of skin colour alone.\n\nTinaye further stated: Its quite easy to feel isolated and feel like youre out of place and losing your culture.But, when youre surrounded by people and hearing your language even though you are not in your country, you realise that you are not alone. Zimfest is empowering in that, I know that guaranteed for at least one day of the year, I will be able to evade the everyday sense of minority to exist within the majority on the Zimfest grounds  just like kumusha.\n\nCommenting on her experience as an African migrant living in the Diaspora, my friend Fikunmi further stated: It was hard fitting into British culture and often I felt alone, but being at Zimfest helped me know that I am not alone, and even with people outside of my own culture I have a family.\n\nLooking Back and Looking Forward\n\nThe establishment and organisation of such a significant and meaningful celebration of culture and identity is far from a lacklustre trick which can be pulled together overnight but rather a process of resilience, dedication, determination and reflection.\n\nStuck in a mesmerising haze of Zimfest nostalgia, I became curious to find out more about how and why Zimfest has become such a noteworthy event on both a personal level, for me as a second-generation Zimbabwean migrant living in the Diaspora, and on a community level for the thousands of people I join with each year. This led me to ask a representative from the Zimfest organising team to reflect on the main motivations for Zimfest, the vision for Zimfest itself and the vision for the generations to come:\n\nAlthough gone are the days of seeing Mtukudzi (MHSRIEP)  the first high-profile musician to play at Zimfest  and Mukanya onstage, there are so many magnificent ways Zimfest has continued to improve over the years since its humble beginnings as a come together without the focus on music that we appreciate nowadays. This includes the innovation of the festival to include the younger generation by adding features such as the Fun Fair and the Amapiano tent. Tinaye further commented: Its great to see so many young Zimbabweans, South Africans and Africans embracing their culture and keeping up with the mainstream artistry of Zimbabwe even though we do not live there.\n\nPersonally, I loved how the layout of Zimfest improved this year, with the Fun Fair area becoming more central. Despite being too old for the trampolines, it was a delight to discover that I still qualified to ride the Ferris wheel. What a superb way to soak in the views at Zimfest! I personally cannot wait to try out the swing ride that made its first appearance this year, next year!\n\nA view of the Zimfest crowds from the ferris wheel\n\nThe Zimfest organisers representative commenting on Zimfests plans to become even bigger and fresher said: To enhance Zimfest, the plan includes featuring diverse, internationally acclaimed artists and introducing new activities like dance sessions and cultural exhibitions for various age groups. A hybrid experience with virtual attendance will attract a global audience. By gathering continuous attendee feedback, Zimfest aims to innovate and remain relevant, ultimately creating an inclusive celebration that fosters unity and pride in cultural heritage.\n\nI have always felt included at Zimfest and appreciated it as a family festival. However, this year, there were some community concerns raised about Zimfest remaining as family friendly and inclusive as previous years. With respect to these concerns, the Zimfest organising team representative expressed: Zimfest aims to create a family-friendly atmosphere by enhancing its appeal for all ages. Key initiatives include:\n\nCommunity Business Ethics\n\nIt is thanks to Black Zimbabwean-owned businesses such as Nyama Butchery (now closed) in Birmingham and Mwanaka Fresh Farm Foods in Walsall and local businesses such as Palmers in Milton Keynes and Joseph Morris Butchers that I have grown up with the gap between life in the Diaspora and lifekumushamore bridged. Growing up, stepping through the PVC strip curtains of the Nyama butchery  donned the maputi shop by either me or my sister and eventually the whole household  felt like arriving at Narnia itself. It is here that I developed my lifelong love for lemon creams and Mazoes cream soda. In August 2023, I was blessed to be invited to celebrate the renowned Mwanaka Fresh Farm Foods 20+ years of farming in Cambridge. The day was deeply emotional and inspiring to see such great success and be told such poignant stories within my very own community.\n\nFrom the small stores selling wonders beaming with Zimbabwean pride, such as gorgeous jewellery (shoutout to Rungano from Paper Pieces for the beautiful, sustainable jewellery I bought last year), stylish Zimbabwean apparel and mouth-watering snacks, to the major sponsors, such as World Remit and Diaspora Insurance, the message is clear: it is fundamental that we as Black Africans, support Black owned and African owned businesses. The money spent here has so much more significance and promotes far more ethical business practices than a quick order from the likes of Shein and Temu. For example, in the UK, it is a reality that the Black British community has a spending power of 300 billion, yet only 2% of this is spent within Black-owned businesses. By supporting Black owned and African-owned businesses, you contribute to alleviating existing economic disparities and breaking down systemic barriers that bog down Black enterprises.\n\nJewellery at Paper Pieces 2024 Zimfest Stall\n\nCommenting on the economic significance of Zimfest and wider community impacts, Jeff Madzingo, the CEO and Founder ofDiaspora Insurance, stated that Zimfest is a very significant event in more than one way. Beyond the socio-cultural importance, it glues a thriving community celebrating identity and togetherness. He further stated We, Diaspora Insurance, always plug in as a sponsor to make it worthwhile and economically viable to the organisers because Zimfest as a whole is not just an opportunity to empower each other, but a little economy where our black spending power is leveraged to prop up small community businesses that serve us as a people. By supporting the businesses of our people, we also invest in the economies of our home countries. When devouring delicious plates of food at Zimfest that leave you wanting to lick your fingers, it is not only the body that is being gloriously fed, but our businesses, our economies and our people.\n\nWhile Zimfest is very much about being together and interacting as a people, we must not forget the tangible, physical grounds and natural environment of Zimfest that allow us to partake in our festivities side by side. As well as maintaining respect for each other as attendees, we must also respect the venue and the natural grounds upon which we have been united and brought together as a community. After Zimfest, there were eyesores of waste littering the once green Herts Country Showground and a dismal afterparty of litter picking and waste removal had begun.\n\nA View of the Rubbish leftover at The Herts County Showground after Zimfest\n\nIn response to my queries on what Zimfest could implement and introduce to reduce waste and become more sustainable, the representative from the Zimfest organising team commented: Partnering with environmental organisations boosts recycling through more bins and community education on waste disposal. Collaborating with vendors to reduce single-use plastics and use biodegradable materials supports sustainability. Hosting workshops provides practical tips, fostering lasting environmental awareness. This strategy minimises waste and enhances community engagement for a greener future. As for the hideous congregations of waste dumped and abandoned by attendees at the venue after the event, the Zimfest representative stated: Efficient post-event waste management is essential for sustainability. Key strategies include:\n\nCollaborating with local waste management services for effective processing.\n\nHeres to a more green, clean and sustainable Zimfest!\n\nThe music, artistry and dancing\n\nZimfest is a place where people of all ages can dance as one.\n\nWithin a behind-the-scenes video displayed to the audience at a school fundraiser before my performance, I explained, Dancing in general [it was a tap performance] has always been such a passion of mine and a large part of that is credited to my heritage as a Shona person. Zimfest wholeheartedly made me feel the power of this acknowledgement. Through dancing and music, I immediately feel connected to my heritage, culture and history. This is why, as a second-generation Zimbabwean migrant living in the Diaspora, I am grateful to be able to attend festivals like Zimfest where you can fully embrace and enjoy the collective melodies, basslines, sways and shuffles that pulse through your body and tenderly deliver you home. Whether in the queue for food, walking across the grass to the main action or in the middle of the Amapiano tent, we were jiving and vibing. We were truly here. After leaving early morning and driving hours on the motorway to get to Zimfest, the sight of the Amapiano tent in the distance as we increasingly approached the Herts County Showground not only raised the energy in the car but also reenergised my sleepy self in the left backseat. Unaware of how the days events would unfold, I began to feel prepared and excited  a true testimony to the power of Zimfest.\n\nThe Amapiano tent at Zimfest 25\n\nOne special, cherished thing about the celebration and rejoice that occurs at Zimfest is that we rejoice in our mother languages. Living in the Diaspora, my mother tongue, Shona, is a language that often goes unheard as you pass by strangers on the street, get taught in the classrooms or converse with peers. Yet, at Zimfest, Shona is far from scarce. Reflecting on her experience in the Amapiano tent and in front of the main stage, Tinaye stated, People being able to pronounce the lyrics stood out to me the most. Hearing the crowd singing what sounds correct was quite shocking. The opportunity to hear your language being spoken, sung and chanted en masse is an undeniably soul-soothing experience that I never take for granted.\n\nDespite not understanding the lyrics of the songs, I have watched my non-Zimbabwean friends turn into absolute fanatics of Zimbabwean music and Amapiano. From some never even hearing of Amapiano before, humorously mistaking it for me saying Im a piano to jumping in a manner almost as spirited as Jah Signal in the Amapiano tent, it was pure bliss to see them fully embrace the Zimbabwean rhythms and festivities. Seeing their excitement to see Winky D grace the Zimfest stage as headliner once again was a wonderful way to end our time at Zimfest. Winky Ds stage presence is undoubtedly barrier-breaking not just beyond language but for the physical distance fromkumusha. Despite the headliner no longer onstage and the Zimfest crowds already dispersing, it wasnt yet our time to go. At least, not before taking some group pictures at this years newly added Zimfest sign adorned with the colours of the Zimbabwean flag. What a way to close off such a monumental day of unity, pride, radiance and transcendence!\n\nThe newly added Zimfest Sign on the Herts Country Showground\n\nWhile this years Zimfest lineup certainly did not cease to enthral and entertain, there are still ways to improve, especially with regard to inclusivity and diversity. In response to my inquiry about the diversification of Zimfest to, for example, include more languages and a more diverse lineup with more women, the representative from the Zimfest organising team replied: Incorporating other African languages into Zimfest would enhance inclusivity, celebrate diverse cultures, attract a wider audience, and foster cultural exchange. Zimfest focuses on enhancing diversity by including more languages and a varied lineup, actively seeking female artists from diverse African backgrounds. Future plans involve partnering with cultural ambassadors and community leaders to highlight unique contributions from different African communities.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese are the reasons why I, as a second-generation migrant living in the Diaspora, have always felt Zimfest is the day of summer, if not the year, that I always look forward to. From the small joys of finding out I wasnt too old for the ferris wheel to the big joys of watching my non-Zimbabwean friends indulge in Sadza for the first time and later repeatedly scream at the top of their lungs in unison with the Zimfest crowds Noooooo in response to Winky D asking Can I go home?, Zimfest is a true refresher for the soul and spirit. We must come to festivals such as Zimfest to celebrate, support and rejoice as a people with Ubuntu ablaze.\n\nI simply cannot stop scrolling through the new memories captured in my camera roll. The return home after Zimfest has not just been physical  equipped with new, beautiful jewellery to adorn at my next outing and a cheeky packet of lemon creams my mum surprised me with this week  but emotional, spiritual and transcendental. The warmth of Zimfest takes me back to my few but meaningful moments kumusha such as sitting across the blazing fire and bonding with my loved ones to watchingvana sekuru nanambuyajive while Zim classics such as Mukanyas Chimurenga music ring out. The event began with rain leading us to take cover in the Amapiano tent  with our dance moves making it all less miserable  and, as the festivities progressed and picked up, it was not just the daylight that got brighter and clearer.\n\n",
