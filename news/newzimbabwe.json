            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Constitutional Court has struck down the University of Zimbabwes (UZ) appeal in a long-running labour dispute with former bursar Vengai Mugabe, declaring prior court proceedings a nullity in every sense.\n\nDelivering the judgment, Justice Anne-Mary Gowora ruled that both the Labour Court and the Supreme Court acted without proper jurisdiction.\n\nIt has been made clear that there must be compliance with statutory requirements in order for the court to assert jurisdiction over matters, she said. The lack of adherence to these procedural safeguards rendered the previous judgments ineffective and void.\n\nMugabe, appointed bursar on a fixed-term contract from July 2017 to June 2021, was dismissed following clashes with university management. A labour officer later awarded him US$323,036 for unfair dismissal, a ruling UZ unsuccessfully appealed.\n\nRepresenting Mugabe, attorney Tawanda Zhuwarara said the earlier rulings violated fundamental rights enshrined in sections 56 and 71 of the Constitution, adding that the Supreme Courts decision was an arbitrary deprivation of property.\n\nUZs lawyer, G. Madzoka, countered that the application was nothing more than a disguised appeal, arguing that the underlying issues had already been settled.\n\nJustice Rita Makarau noted the unacceptable failure by lower courts to address preliminary points vital to fairness.\n\nDeclaring both earlier rulings void, the Court found the proceedings fraught with irregularities.\n\n",

There are people talking on his behalf, the Bombshell Gezas, but Chiwenga has not publicly expressed interest in higher office.\n\nHowever, from experience, we know that during the turbulence at the end of Robert Mugabes rule, Mnangagwa never openly declared his ambitions to succeed Mugabe. He kept quiet and did most of his machinations behind the scenes.\n\nSo we might be hearing a lot of noise about the Chiwenga faction, but we do not know what is happening in the background. His silence says a lot because it would be unwise for him to speak openly about it now, whatever plans he may have. But from where I stand, given the mandate and legitimacy Mnangagwa enjoys within Zanu PF, it would take a miracle for Chiwenga to recover from this, said Ngwenya.\n\nZanu PF is reportedly preparing a constitutional amendment in Parliament to allow President Mnangagwa to remain in power beyond the 2028 elections.\n\nHowever, the ruling party faces major legal hurdles, including Section 91(2), which bars a president from seeking a third term, and Section 328(7), which prohibits an incumbent from benefiting from a constitutional amendment enacted during their tenure.\n\nA leaked dossier, allegedly authored by Chiwenga, claims that Zanu PF intends to smuggle a document titled Breaking Barriers Initiative (BBI) into Parliament to suspend elections and extend both the presidents and the legislatures terms.\n\nNgwenya, however, dismissed the documents credibility, which is said to be linked to self-imposed CCC Secretary General, Sengezo Tshabangu.\n\nBBI is moribund because it tinkers with the illusion that you can simply change the constitution to achieve anything. My assumption is that not everyone within Zanu PF supports this agenda.\n\nThey might not say it publicly, but its nave to assume that if this matter goes to Parliament, it would automatically pass. BBI is just an academic document, Ngwenya said.\n\n",

Sikandar Raza (3-30), Newman Nyamhuri (3-42) and Blessing Muzarabani (2-56) were the major stars with the ball as Afghanistan folded for a paltry total of 157. In reply, Zimbabwes opening pair of Ben Curran and Joylord Gumbie negotiated three overs before bad light forced slightly early stumps with Zimbabwe at 6/0. It capped a strong start to the game for the hosts who won a good toss earlier in the morning.\n\nIncessant rains and then wet outfield meant that the first session was entirely lost and Zimbabwes captain Craig Ervine had no hesitation to bowl on winning the toss. After a slightly erratic start with the new ball, the Zimbabwe pacers got their radar right on a pitch that had life in it. Extra bounce was on offer and some seam movement as well, although not as extravagant as generally seen at this venue. Abdul Malik and debutant Riaz Hassan weathered the early storm but both fell in quick succession once Zimbabwes new-ball pairing hit their straps.\n\nIt was, however, a run out that gave Zimbabwe the first breakthrough as Hassan fell to a direct hit from Brian Bennett. It was just the tonic the home side needed and Nyamhuri then got Malik caught behind to give Zimbabwe further momentum in the afternoon session. Rahmat Shah and Hashmatullah Shahidi prevented further damage in the session but Zimbabwe continued to make inroads after tea. The impressive Nyamhuri broke the partnership between last games heroes Rahmat and Shahidi but getting the skipper LBW. Raza then got into the act to castle Rahmat as Afghanistan continued to slip away.\n\nOnce Rahmat fell, it was a procession for the visitors as Raza and Muzarabani sliced through the lower order. If not for comeback man Rashid Khans 20-ball 25, the total would have been much lesser. Even with the tricky nature of the pitch, the Afghanistan were easily about 50-60 runs short although the pitch cannot be judged till both sides bat on it.\n\nBrief scores:Afghanistan 157 (Sikandar Raza 3-30, Newman Nyamhuri 3-30) vs Zimbabwe 6/0\n\n",
