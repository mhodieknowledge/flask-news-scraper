She always said Id make it in art. I wish she was here to see this.\n\nAfter studying art at Magwegwe High School, Rasta followed his dreams to South Africa. He hustled in restaurants and construction before art came knocking again.\n\nIf its a calling, you cant hide it, he said. I had to slow down everything else when art started shouting my name.\n\nKnown for his often debated portraits of Mzansis late icons, Rasta said painting faces is his way of telling stories.\n\nPortraits show your journey and story, he said. Art is entertainment on its own. If youre not criticised, youre not working.\n\nHes dreaming of exhibitions to honour legends such as Vuyo Mokoena, Lundi Tyamara, Riky Rick, HHP and ProKid, with proceeds going to their families.\n\nHes also made his mark on screen, appearing inDiepCity, Black DoorandGomoraand starring in a viral Chicken Licken ad.\n\nThat ad was a movie. If adverts had awards, that one wouldve scooped it, he laughed.\n\nThrough the fame, criticism and memes, Rasta remains grounded and grateful.\n\nIve been threatened not to paint, but this is my God-given talent, he said.\n\nIm a soldier. I pray, I paint and I bring bread home.\n\nAnd to his critics? Rasta smiles and keeps sketching.\n\nIm an art believer. As long as I have paint, Ill keep telling our stories.\n\n",

He did not say when the restrictions will be lifted.\n\nDar es Salaam Regional Commissioner Alfred Chalamila had earlier warned that the government would take strong action against those disrupting peace in the city.\n\nDemonstrations were also reported in the south-western city of Mbeya and the border town of Tunduma.\n\nWe are tired We want an independent electoral commission so that every Tanzanian can choose the leader they want, a protester told the BBC.\n\nAlong with the unrest of the streets, internet connectivity across the country has been severely disrupted. Global internet monitor NetBlocks described the interruption a nationwide digital blackout.\n\nReports say that voter turnout in Dar es Salaam was low when polls opened on Wednesday, with many hesitant to show up amid safety concerns.\n\nA police spokesperson had assured the public there was no threat to their safety, saying people should come out and vote, according to a message posted on social media.\n\nMore than 37 million registered voters are eligible to cast their ballots in the presidential and parliamentary election.\n\nSixteen fringe parties, none of whom have historically had significant public support, have been cleared to contest against President Samia, who is seeking a second term.\n\nThe only other serious contender, Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo party, was disqualified on legal technicalities.\n\nSamias ruling party, CCM, has dominated the countrys politics and has never lost an election since independence.\n\nAhead of the election, rights groups condemned government repression, with Amnesty International citing a wave of terror involving enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings of opposition figures.\n\nThe government rejected the claims, and officials said the election would be free and fair.\n\nSamia came into office in 2021 as Tanzanias first female president following the death of President John Magufuli.\n\nShe was initially praised for easing political repression under her predecessor, but the political space has since narrowed, with her government accused of targeting critics through arrests and a wave of abductions.\n\nThe electoral body is expected to announce results in three days after voting ends.\n\n",

During that time, they contracted occupational diseases such as tuberculosis and silicosis.\n\nThe MoU enables the Tshiamiso Trust to facilitate compensation for former Wenela workers who were employed in the neighbouring country between March 12 1965, and December 10 2019.\n\nTshiamiso Trust Chief Executive Officer, Munyadziwa Kwinda, said the agreement is a turning point for the majority of the former mineworkers and their dependants who have had to endure a long wait.\n\nWe are honoured to mark this moment in partnership with the Government of Zimbabwe and NSSA. Thousands of Zimbabwean ex-mineworkers have been waiting for Tshiamiso Trust services to commence so that they can access compensation that they may qualify for.\n\nTodays agreement means they can now lodge their claims and complete the medical assessments required to determine their eligibility for compensation. This is about restoring dignity and delivering on the promise made to the men and families who built the mining industry, said Kwinda.\n\nProspective claimants, however, must meet certain criteria, including providing proof that they suffered from a work-related illness.\n\nDependants of the deceased can claim after providing proof of relationship and a death certificate indicating the cause of death.\n\nThe National Social Security Authority (NSSA), which partnered with Tshiamiso on behalf of the government, said the compensation will bring relief to the former mineworkers and their dependants.\n\nZimbabwe is home to many who spent their working lives in South Africas mines and returned home with illnesses that changed their futures. Through this collaboration, we are ensuring that those who qualify can now access the compensation due to them, closer to where they live.\n\nNSSA remains committed to working with regional partners like Tshiamiso Trust to expand social security and strengthen cross-border protection for our workers, said NSSA Chief Executive Officer Charles Shava.\n\nThe Tshiamiso Trust has already paid R2.4 billion to 25,000 beneficiaries in Lesotho, South Africa, Mozambique, Eswatini, and Botswana.\n\n",

This marks a 511% increase from 2019 levels, a remarkable turnaround in just six years.\n\nThe expansion aligns with Zimbabwes broader strategy to reduce dependence on imports, especially following the global grain price spikes triggered by theRussiaUkraineconflict.\n\nWheatis the countrys second most important cereal after maize, and domestic self-sufficiency is seen as critical to stabilising food prices and strengthening food security.\n\nFocus on export opportunities and market stability\n\nWith domestic needs fully met, Zimbabwe is now seeking export opportunities within the region, particularly in neighboring countries that continue to face wheat shortages.\n\nHowever, Masuka emphasized that local supply remains secure and that the government has taken measures to stabilise pricing and ensure smooth distribution.\n\nThe government has released 6,518 metric tonnes to millers in recent weeks to stabilise supply and pricing levels of wheat products, he said, noting that the Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA) continues to coordinate marketing and distribution to maintain market balance.\n\nDespite the surplus, Zimbabwe will continue importing limited volumes of high-gluten wheat, which is preferred by some millers for specific bread formulations.\n\nCertain millers have indicated that their mills and bread styles require high gluten content wheat not achievable in locally produced wheat, Masuka explained.\n\nAccording to him, as per current policy, such wheat will continue to be imported under existing arrangements, without any additional costs.\n\nThe government is urging registered millers and industry players to collaborate closely with authorities under the AMA framework to ensure a consistent balance between production, demand, and market stability.\n\nZimbabwes wheat success story reflects years of deliberate investment in irrigation infrastructure, farmer training, and private-sector partnerships.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), sub-SaharanAfricastill imports over 80% of its wheat consumption, underscoring Zimbabwes rare achievement in the region.\n\n",
