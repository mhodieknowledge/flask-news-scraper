            "content": "BBC\n\nThe Kenyan authorities paid a network of trolls to threaten and intimidate young protesters during recent anti-government demonstrations, Amnesty International has said.\n\nA new report by the human rights organisation said government agencies also employed surveillance and disinformation to target organisers of the mass protests, which swept Kenya across 2024 and 2025.\n\nThe demonstrations were driven largely by Gen Z activists who used social media platforms to mobilise.\n\nIn response to Amnestys report, Kenyas interior minister said the government does not sanction harassment or violence against any citizen.\n\nBut Amnesty said it had uncovered a campaign to silence and suppress the protesters.\n\nYoung women and LGBT+ activists were disproportionately targeted, with misogynistic and homophobic comment, as well as AI-generated pornographic images, the report said.\n\nThe BBC has approached the government for further comment.\n\nOne activist told Amnesty: I had people coming into my inbox and telling me: You will die and leave your kids. We will come and attack you.\n\nI even had to change my childs school. Someone sent me my childs name, the age the school bus number plate. They told me: If you continue doing what youre doing then we will take care of this child for you.\n\nIt has long been believed that the government employs a network of individuals, known as keyboard warriors, to push its online messages.\n\nThe report features a man who said he was part of a team paid between 25,000 and 50,000 Kenyan shillings (about $190-$390; 145-300) per day to amplify government messaging and drown out trending protest hashtags on social media platform X.\n\nAs part of its research, Amnesty spoke to 31 young human rights defenders who had participated in the protests. Nine of these activists said they had received violent threats via X, TikTok, Facebook and WhatsApp.\n\nAs well as digital abuse, the authorities have also been accused of carrying out a brutal crackdown on the protests.\n\nMore than 100 people died, rights groups say, when police clashed with protesters during two waves of demonstrations  one in 2024 and one in 2025.\n\nThe authorities were also accused of arbitrary arrests, enforced disappearances and using lethal force against the protesters.\n\nThe government accepted there had been some case of excessive force by police, butalso defended the security forces in other instances.\n\nThe demonstrations railed against issues such as proposed tax rises, increasing femicide and corruption.\n\nAmnesty chief Agns Callamard said the organisations report clearly demonstrates widespread and coordinated tactics on digital platforms to silence and suppress protests by young activists.\n\nOur research also proves that these campaigns are driven by state-sponsored trolls, individuals and networks paid to promote pro-government messages and dominate Kenyas daily trends on X, she added.\n\nKenyas Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen said: The government of Kenya does not sanction harassment, or violence against any citizen any officer implicated in unlawful conduct bears individual responsibility and is subject to investigation and sanction.\n\nAmnesty also raised concerns about unlawful state surveillance, including allegations  denied by Kenyas largest telecom provider, Safaricom  that authorities used mobile data to monitor protest leaders.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nOpposition leader Tendai Biti has launched a scathing attack on President Emmerson Mnangagwas administration, accusing it of being driven by greed and transforming Zimbabwe into a rag-tag corrupt extractive entity over the past eight years, dashing the hopes of improved governance that many held when they backed the 2017 military coup that removed the late former President Robert Mugabe.\n\nThis November marks eight years since the military coup dubbed Operation Restore Legacy, which ushered in a new administration under Mnangagwa.\n\nBiti argues that the countrys social and economic conditions have deteriorated further under Mnangagwa and that it has now become clear Zimbabweans regret taking to the streets in support of the coup.\n\nFormer cabinet minister Tendai Biti\n\nIn 8 years they have watched their dreams being butchered by a ruthless cantankerous regime that has no limits nor elasticity. The Frankenstein that Mugabe was has been replaced by a ghoulish vampire sobriquet driven by greed, corruption, voyeurism and bohemianism. There are no more rules. There are no more standards. There is no longer ideology, principle or any higher norm. A pack of hungry ravenous hyenas are on steroids consuming everything and anything in their way, Biti wrote on X on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the Prosecutor General, Zimbabwe is losing at least US$2 billion annually to corruption and ranks149th on the International Corruption Index. Biti says the scale of graft reflects a government driven by greed.\n\nAdded Biti: Zimbabwes mines, its gold, its lithium, its chrome are on the guillotine, being looted with a ferocity that would make Cecil John Rhodes wince in embarrassment.\n\nThe countrys State Enterprises have been privatised and captured under a shady web called the Mutapa Fund. A ghost caricature that operates outside the reach of Parliament and line Ministries.\n\nBiti further accused Treasury of abandoning basic oversight principlesand operatinglike a tuck shop, with funds reportedly disbursed to tenderpreneurs willing to pay kickbacks.\n\nFormer Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Budget and Finance chairperson Energy Mutodi told Parliament in October that the Permanent Secretary for the Ministry of Finance, George Guvamatanga, was demanding kickbacks from ministries and government contractors of between 5% and 10%, reportedly reaching as much as US$200,000 per disbursement.\n\nThe National Purse, once jealously protected by years of British tradition of checks and balance, is now a little tuck shop that makes disbursements to anyone prepared to pay the proverbial ten percent to a coterie of Bandits clad in Savile Row suits, Biti added.\n\nThe former Finance Minister also criticised Mnangagwas handling of major tenders, saying controversial businessmen such as Kudakwashe Tagwirei and Wicknell Chivayo had become major beneficiaries of opaque procurement processes.\n\nTenderpreneurs who have cut their teeth in Command Agriculture and fuel are the new High Priests of a decadent dystopian reality created by 18 November. The party of Tekere and Herbert Chitepo, a pan African moment is now the embarrassed harem of Rolls-Royce-riding buffoons in oversized pajamas. It is now a parallel entity flanked by engineered affiliates united only by greed and vacuousness, he added.\n\nVice President Constantino Chiwenga has publicly labelled the controversial tenderpreneurs as a corrupt business mafia deserving imprisonment, while Mnangagwa has described them as philanthropists, insisting he cannot dictate how they spend their money.\n\nA few months ago, Chiwenga reportedly tabled a corruption dossier in a Zanu PF Politburo meeting, implicating Chivayo, Tagwirei, Delish Nguwaya, Pedzai Sakupwanya and Paul Tungwarara, questioning why no arrests had been made.\n\n",
