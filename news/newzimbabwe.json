Private sector engagement is vital to every economy. Through our Global Gateway strategy, the EU has placed business development at the core of economic development, job creation and prosperity, EU Ambassador Jobst von Kirchmann said.\n\nThe bloc said the EU-Zimbabwe Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA) and the EUs Global Gateway offers yet another framework for increased trade and investment for local companies who have the possibility to export to the EU on a 100% duty-free, quota-free basis.\n\nThe agreement offers Zimbabwean companies the possibility to modernise and transform their manufacturing processes through the importation of machinery duty-free from Europe, while allowing Zimbabwean companies to export duty-free and tariff-free to the EU.\n\nWith a trade volume of US$ 700 million and a positive trade balance in favour of Zimbabwe, this is a significant area of cooperation as the EU represents Zimbabwes fifth-largest trading partner and number one destination for horticultural exports.\n\n",

I dont understand someone who comes from Zimbabwe, stays in Zimbabwe, grew up in Zimbabwe and tries to talk Patwa, because Patwa was only spoken by the slaves.\n\nPatwa also came along during the times they spent in the plantations and thats the only language they could speak.\n\nEven in Jamaica its spoken but those who didnt learn, so why would someone from Zimbabwe speak Patwa?. I love something which is authentic, yes I love reggae I will listen to reggae, I love dancehall I will listen to the real dancehall, then when we are in Zimbabwe I want to listen to something that is Zimbabwean.\n\nIm not a fan but I dont say what he does is bad, but for my taste Im not a fan, said Mangwana\n\nOllah posed a question that the people, or rather the government, portray Winky D as someone who fights the government through his word play in songs and there was a time that radio stations stopped playing his songs.\n\nIf he fights it, would he win? When was it? Was I the Permanent Secretary? Because if I was the Permanent Secretary we are the ones who can do that but we never did that and we dont know it.\n\nWe dont even talk about him, somebody is out there trying to earn a living, we allow them to earn a living. Our lives are not defined on binary lines, that its either you are for or against or you are pro Zanu PF, no it doesnt define our lives, we are human beings first, Zimbabweans second and then whatever follows, said Mangwana.\n\nFurthermore, Mangwana dismissed that the government and the traditional media doesnt do propaganda.\n\nThey are wrong, we dont do propaganda, traditional media doesnt do propaganda, what it does is it gives information of course in any information giving you certain ideals that you are promoting and certain agendas that you would want to push but thats not propaganda.\n\nIts just like right now if we call someone to come and talk about anti-drugs, is he giving anti-drugs propaganda? So, if we come and talk about the beauty of the Second Republic, we are not giving propaganda we are just making you see that the Second Republic is something else, argued Mangwana.\n\n",

They feel like they are running on empty.\n\nWriting on his X account under the pseudonym Jamwanda 2, Charamba acknowledged the credibility of the lecturers cause, stating it warrants immediate attention.\n\nFrankly our university lecturers have a genuine grievance. I will take it up! Charamba declared.\n\nSelf-exiled former Higher and Tertiary Education Minister Professor Jonathan Moyo did not mince his words, accusing the government and UZ management of colluding to condemn lecturers to poverty. He branded their poor wages a national disgrace. He said the current state of affairs is a recipe for disaster.\n\nThe university authorities and the ministry cannot escape the indictment that their inability to redress the situation is a shocking administrative failure and abuse of duty, which has resulted in an intolerable violation of the human dignity of the academic staff at state universities, Moyo wrote on his X feed Friday.\n\nNot only is this a national embarrassment, but it is also a threat to the countrys economic interests with national security implications, Moyo added.\n\nMoyo, who previously championed Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) policy implementation as Minister of Higher and Tertiary Education, further stated that it is entirely impossible for Zimbabwe to develop economically without adequate support for academic staff across state universities, who are naturally implementing STEM initiatives at tertiary institutions.\n\nIt would be impossible for Zimbabwe to defeat the enemies of the people, namely; hunger, poverty, disease, ignorance and corruption without the kind of intellectual property that can only come from higher education; particularly but not only through Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), Moyo wrote.\n\nWhile the UZ academic staff have been languishing in enforced poverty due to the unilateral slashing of their salaries in 2018, the AUT alleges that the UZ management has simultaneously awarded itself lavish packages, including luxury cars and hefty US dollar perks, whilst prioritising non-essential projects at the expense of the welfare and working conditions of the academic staff.\n\nThey said the UZ management seem to be living in a different world.\n\nThe current reduced salary of US$230 includes a local currency component, averaging ZWG 6,000 to 8,000, which amounts to less than US$200.\n\nThe lecturers strike is continuing outside the UZ campus premises, with numbers visibly increasing by the day.\n\nThe AUT members are vowing to continue with the protest until the government and UZ management find a lasting solution.\n\nNewZimbabwe.com understands that all academic services have been suspended at UZ as lecturers continue to demand their pre-October 2018 salaries of US$2,250.\n\n",
