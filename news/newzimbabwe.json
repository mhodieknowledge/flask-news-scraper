Saturday, as dropping points will be a huge setback for either side.Battling for survival in the relegation zone, where it occupies second-from-bottom position, Dynamos FC are aiming to maintain its three-match winning streak, while Scottland FC are also looking to keep up the pressure on log leaders Simba Bhora.Scottland are second on the log with 52 points, one behind Simba Bhora, who are travelling to Chiredzi for a tricky fixture against Green Fuel FC.Tension have been high between the two sides ahead of Saturdays game, as witnessed by a social media battle among the two sides fans over who will sit at the famous Vietnam stand at Rufaro Stadium.Commenting ahead of the fixture, Dynamos coach Kelvin Kaindu revealed how important a victory on Saturday is for them.We are still in the drop zone, so we want to hopefully remain consistent and keep on picking points to give us an advantage in terms of our position.I think in the last few games, the points that we have picked havent changed our position.If we pick up maximum points, it will give us an advantage and probably change the position where we are, said Kaindu.Dynamos are basking in the glory of a three-match

It is estimated that Zimbabwe produces approximately 150 000 tons of black granite annually with Mutoko contributing about 75% of that output.EMA Mashonaland East provincial spokesperson, Astas Mabwe this work commended rising appreciation levels on matters of environmental concern.Off-hand as EMA, I wouldnt be able to tell the statistics district by district, but I would say in Togo generally, most of the granite mines have Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) certificates. In very few cases where you find those people starting their operations without an EIA. But the residual problematic areas are in the Makaha area where small-scale gold miners ply their trade, he said.Mabwe urged local communities to insist on conducting EIAs saying such procedures are the cornerstones of resolving all the potential disputes way before they go out of hand.He said the document avails the opportunity for communities to say out their worries, what they think may be violated and gives the proponent an opportunity to provide answers.We would like to applaud Silveira House for supporting such efforts which have made us realise these high environmental awareness levels. They have assisted in making environmental protection a reality.At the end of the day, what we want is sustainability. While miners get money from these mineral resources, there is need to balance such goals with environmental preservation.So they are really helping the government to have a conscious society. We really applaud them, and they have called us as EMA at various platforms, and we are proud of that, said Mabwe.However, Mutoko RDC Ward 10 Councillor, Robert Mabvuta said while some notable progress has been made, there is still need to raise awareness and strengthen communities appreciation of EIAs processes to stop miners from shortchanging communities.Ward 5 Councillor, David Kadiki called on authorities to find ways to punish miners, who evade conducting EIAs and those who fail to adhere to what they agreed on with the communities.\n\nThe Mashonaland East town hosts some of the countrys largest black granite miners as well as some gold mines.

The black majority was confined to communal lands and all but completely excluded from commercial farming.This mirrored our own experience in South Africa.It was, therefore, essential for both historical redress and food security, development and economic growth that the government embarked on ambitious reforms to facilitate the entry of black Zimbabweans into productive agriculture, including support to small-scale farmers, Ramaphosa said.He also congratulated Zimbabwe for the measures being taken to revive the countrys agricultural sector through policy reforms, investment in irrigation and mechanisation, and empowering large and small-scale farmers.We know that the agricultural sector has been heavily affected by the growing impacts of the changing climate.Severe drought has impacted crop yields in recent years.Adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change are an imperative for all nations. Collaboration among countries is critical to the success of these efforts, added the South African President.He said: Biosecurity is another area in which Zimbabwe and South Africa must step up cooperation.Outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, avian or bird flu, crop infections and others, call on us to pool our resources and strengthen our collaboration, including through our respective research institutions.The SA President explained that technological trends in agriculture must be fully embraced to increase output and conserve resources.By way of example, geo-spacial agriculture using earth observation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has started to feature in some sectors of agriculture in South Africa and Zimbabwe.Such innovation will be key as we collectively build resilience in pursuit of food security, he stated.Even amidst these challenges, Ramaphosa said a constant feature at ZAS had been the commitment to use agriculture as a catalyst for economic growth, sustainable development and historical redress.The hosting of this agriculture show resonates with the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme, which seeks to improve domestic production and marketing as well as the facilitation of regional trade in food staples.It will also help to make our industries more competitive in the global trading market and to make use of the substantial opportunities of the African Continental Free Trade Area, he stated.According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), agriculture accounts for between 60 and 80 percent of employment in the region.We must, therefore, work towards a more enabling regulatory environment to further boost this sector.We need increased investment in small and medium farming entities, particularly those owned and run by women and the youth.President (Emmerson) Mnangagwa and I recently attended the SADC Summit in Madagascar, where agricultural transformation in the region was a major point of discussion.I call on the private sectors in both Zimbabwe and South Africa to use this show to explore avenues for great collaboration that will result in more trade and investment across our borders.Agricultural cooperation is key to sustaining jobs.We need investment in the provision of seeds, training, irrigation schemes, storage facilities and in agro-processing.The development of road, rail and aviation infrastructure is a key catalyst to take agriculture to an even higher level, Ramaphosa added.\n\nOfficially opening this years Zimbabwe Agricultural Show (ZAS) in Harare this Friday, Ramaphosa commended the Government of Zimbabwe for the momentous task of dismantling colonial-era patterns of land ownership where the black majority was confined to communal lands.\n\nOn independence in 1980, the new democratic Government of Zimbabwe had to take on the momentous task of dismantling colonial-era patterns of land ownership.Most of the countrys commercially productive land and large-scale commercial farms were owned by whites.

Ramaphosa added.\n\nThe hosting of this agriculture show resonates with the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme, which seeks to improve domestic production and marketing as well as the facilitation of regional trade in food staples.\n\nIt will also help to make our industries more competitive in the global trading market and to make use of the substantial opportunities of the African Continental Free Trade Area, he stated.According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), agriculture accounts for between 60 and 80 percent of employment in the region.We must,

I like to be biased towards the rural area where diaspora investment can come and partner with the Government in developing our rural areas. Everyone has a kumusha [home] that they came from. Everyone has roots; those people need the diaspora to play ball. It is not just about sending money for medication but also getting involved in the rural district councils, said Mupamhanga.\n\nThe forum brought together Zimbabweans based abroad and policymakers to explore investment opportunities. It was part of the two-day programme which concludes Saturday with an awards gala at the Manna Resorts.\n\nSpeaking at the same event, the UK Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Peter Vowles, said it was vital for Zimbabweans in the diaspora to plough back their experiences into local communities.\n\nMany Zimbabweans in the diaspora are building lives around the world, including in the UK. Many Zimbabweans in the UK dream or plan to return home, and as a British Ambassador, one of the great privileges is meeting British citizens with Zimbabwean heritage coming home. You are bringing back experiences, ideas, and energy that can shape Zimbabwes future, said Vowles.\n\n",
