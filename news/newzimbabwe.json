He was initially diagnosed with lymphoma in 2019, but for the last six months he was also struggling with pneumonia.\n\nMalvia revealed that during his final months the reggae star remained in good spirits, sharing: He was definitely very brave. He was positive throughout it all. About three weeks ago when he was admitted in the hospital he asked if I was worried and I said I am always worried. He told me not to worry because everything was going to be all right. He was always very hopeful.\n\nFollowing Cocoa Teas death, Jamaican Minister of Culture, Gender, Entertainment and Sport, Olivia Grange also spoke to the publication, and shared that she was very saddened by the passing of Sweet Sweet Cocoa Tea.\n\nMinister Grange added: He has been a staple in the industry for so long. He is one of the greatest reggae singers who has ever lived and his work will stand the test of time. We salute him at this time  condolences to his family.\n\nIt has been a pleasure working with him over these years and we are glad that we had the opportunity to give him some of flowers while he was here with us. May his soul rest in peace.\n\nOn X, formerly known asTwitter, others rushed to honour Cocoa Tea  who started out in music aged just 14 and had hits including Rocking Dolly, Rikers Island, and I Lost My Sonia.\n\nMany of Scotts songs were attributed to influencing Jamaican culture and the youth, sharing his Rastafarian morals and encouraging young people to stay in education and work.\n\nGrammy Award-winning reggae artist Morgan Heritage wrote: May your light never fade away big brother. You now rest in Zion with the angels but we will never forget the moments weve shared beloved. Our condolences go out to your entire family. Long live the great legendary icon Cocoa Tea!\n\nThe Wailers, who formed as a separate band following the death of memberBob Marleyin 1981, shared: Rest in power, Cocoa Tea. Your voice and music will always be remembered.\n\nDavid RodiganMBE, known for his work on severalBBCRadio stations, penned: The Reggae world is mourning the loss of one of its finest voices, Cocoa Tea died this morning from cardiac arrest in Fort Lauderdale.\n\nHe leaves behind a catalogue of classic recordings which will forever be played in the pantheon of great Jamaican music.

Unlike the trend for the month-on-month inflation, there was no sudden drop in the trend for year-on-year inflation, as the February USD inflation rate is showing an upward trend.\n\nThe increase in the year-on-year inflation is a cause of concern and underlines the need for US$ inflation stabilisation measures to be prioritised, for example, stopping the enforcement of the exchange rate regime by the FIU, said the industry lobby groups inflation developments tracker.\n\nMarket watchers contend that the rise in US$ inflation is largely influenced by traders habit of evading tight ZWG official rate pricing, which forces them to increase greenback prices to create room for pegging higher local currency prices at premiums that are not far from the parallel market rates.\n\nThe inflation movements confirm that USD inflation is influenced by ZiG inflation, as retailers adjust their prices in line with ZiG prices to avoid prosecution by RBZs Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) for using the parallel market rates, said CZI.\n\nDespite acknowledging the positive impact of the current easing of month-on-month inflation rates to 0.5% for February 2025, the industry said a month-on-month inflation rate of below 1% is crucial to instilling confidence in monetary policy.\n\nWhile the overall month-on-month inflation is still low at only 0.5%, there are still some high-inflation products in the food basket.

Under this project, 650,000 prepaid water meters will be installed in major cities.\n\nThe residents associations pointed out that since the initial prepaid water metering project in Harare was unsuccessful, there is growing uncertainty over whether the true aim of privatisation is to improve water services or to benefit politically connected individuals.\n\nThis raises more questions than answers, leaving uncertainty about whether the goal is to create opportunities for politically connected individuals or to genuinely improve water services.\n\nWe emphasize that installing prepaid water meters will not address the root governance issues that have long undermined water service delivery in Harare.\n\nFundamental problems of transparency and accountability within both the City of Harare and the central government must be resolved first.\n\nThis forced privatisation of water services poses significant public health risks and endangers human lives, the statement added.\n\nThe associations also accused Harare Mayor Jacob Mafume of pushing for a water services takeover without citizen input or full council approval.\n\nRegrettably, rather than engaging in a consultative process, the Harare Mayor has taken a leading role in facilitating the takeover of water services without involving citizens or securing full council resolutions.\n\nThe residents associations further warned that water privatisation will ultimately fail, wasting public funds and putting residents health at risk.\n\n",

            "content": "TimesLive\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa has slammed Afrikaner-interest lobby groups AfriForum and Solidarity as unpatriotic for instigating the diplomatic rift between Pretoria and Washington through fearmongering over South Africas expropriation law.\n\nHowever, he said, whether their actions amounted to treason was best left to law enforcement to decide.\n\nRamaphosa was replying to questions from MPs in parliament on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nHis remarks come as the US has taken multiple actions against South Africa including cutting funding from the Presidents Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) and key officials such as US state secretary Marco Rubio snubbing South Africas G20 events.\n\nANC MP Lufefe Mkutu asked Ramaphosa for his views on AfriForum and Solidaritys attempt to hijack South Africas foreign policy and whether he agreed that the meddling by the organisations constituted treason.\n\nI have expressed my concern and my disappointment at what AfriForum and Solidarity have been doing in spreading misinformation about their own country in the US and I regard that as being unpatriotic, Ramaphosa replied. Because when you are a patriot of a country, the best you do is resolve the problems you have in the country rather than begin to damage the sovereignty of your country by running off to other countries and expecting them to take action against your own country.\n\nRamaphosa said he believed that the organisations instigated the action being taken against South Africa by the Trump administration.\n\nHe said this only sought to spread racist statements about South Africa when the country was focused on redressing past inequalities, but did not name it as treason.\n\nThe fact whether that it is treasonous or not is a matter that, obviously, our law enforcement agencies need to look at. The National Prosecuting Authority needs to look at that. But I take a dim view  in fact a very negative view  of what has ensued as they run around the world badmouthing their own country, putting their country into disrepute  by misinformation.\n\nRamaphosa said the US remained a strategic and historic partner to South Africa, which maintained its active engagements with the US through political, diplomatic and economic channels.\n\nAfter the election of President Trump in November last year, I had a telephone call with him to congratulate him and to reaffirm our commitment as SA to strengthening relations between our two countries.\n\nHe said South Africa will continue to engage the US to correct the mischaracterisation by AfriForum and Solidarity and restore ties between the nations through various channels. He expressed confidence that the diplomatic and political efforts at smoothing things over would succeed.\n\nWe have taken note of an executive order and recent statements by the current US administration about SA and aspects of our domestic and foreign policy. We have expressed concern about the mischaracterisation of the situation in our country and certain of our laws and policy positions.\n\nDA MP George Michalakis asked Ramaphosa what he would say to the car workers and farm workers who would lose jobs when Agoa [the African Growth and Opportunity Act] goes and South Africa can no longer participate in the preferential trade act of the US.\n\nRamaphosa replied saying a number of countries in Africa had been given the opportunity to participate in Agoa, had their participation withdrawn and have had to find ways in which they could enhance their exports.\n\nParticipation in Agoa is not at our behest. It is at the behest of the US and what we seek to do, and have done for many years, is to demonstrate that we are a good trading partner to the US and, indeed, to many countries around the world, he said.\n\nThere is going to be a review of the Agoa process and last year you might recall we held the Africa and US Agoa forum here in our own country and we were able  together with other African countries  to demonstrate that we do derive value from Agoa, but we also give value.\n\nWe export, but we also import from the US. So it is a two-way process as it is with many countries around the world. As it is now, we continue, not only in anticipation of an Agoa initiative, but we continue to expand our export market for a variety of goods around the world, Ramaphosa said.\n\nThe president said Deputy President Paul Mashatile was going to Japan with a ministerial delegation to open up more market space for South African goods in the east.\n\nSimilar visits are planned for the Middle East, Europe and China to foster similar ties.\n\nWe do not take the opportunity that we have, as it is called the African Growth Opportunity Act, lightly. But we also want to demonstrate that, yes, we also have value to add. When I spoke to President Trump  I informed him that we value participating in Agoa but I also informed him that we also sell critical minerals to the US and the relationship is fairly balanced.\n\n",
