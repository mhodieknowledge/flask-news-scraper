            "content": "By Lunga Masuku l Reuters\n\nMBABANE, Aug 22 (Reuters)  Human rights lawyers and activists have sued the government of Eswatini for making a secretive deal with President Donald Trumps administration to accept third-country deportees from the U.S., which they claim was unconstitutional.\n\nThe case was due be heard at the High Court of Eswatini on Friday, but was postponed until September 25 because the government did not file response papers, the lead applicant told Reuters outside the court on Friday.Eswatinis Attorney General Sifiso Khumalo said in a text message that the case had no legal basis. Its a frivolous legal application, he wrote.In July the U.S. deported five individuals from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Cuba and Yemen to the Southern African country. All were convicted felons, and Eswatini says it is holding them in solitary confinement until they can be repatriated.The applicants in the case, led by the Eswatini Litigation Centre, say that the agreement made with the U.S. was illegal because it was not submitted to Parliament for approval and the terms were not disclosed.They also say they do not know the condition of the deportees because no one has been allowed access to them.We want the executive to be held accountable, we want transparency dealing with matters of state importance, (and) respect for the rights of all individuals who are in Eswatini regardless of who they may be, said lead applicant and lawyer Mzwandile Masuku.Eswatini, an absolute monarchy ruled by King Mswati III, has previously said the deportees pose no threat and that the agreement was based purely on its good relations with Washington.The International Organization for Migration told Reuters it had received a request from Eswatini to provide post-arrival assistance for the deportees, but did not say whether it would accept or what that might entail.We are discussing with Government of Eswatini, their request, a spokesperson for the U.N. agency said on Thursday.Trump aims to deport millions of immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally and his administration has sought to increase removals to third countries.Additional reporting and writing by Nellie Peyton; Editing by Toby Chopra.\n\nThe case was due be heard at the High Court of Eswatini on Friday, but was postponed until September 25 because the government did not file response papers, the lead applicant told Reuters outside the court on Friday.\n\nEswatinis Attorney General Sifiso Khumalo said in a text message that the case had no legal basis.

The newly recruited group is tasked with the responsibility to work on the dust road for a monthly payment on very flexible terms.\n\nInformation obtained by our publication from the workers shows that they are allowed to attend to the road after completing their daily household chores and even at comfortable timeframes which they decide on.\n\nSpeaking on the latest developments on the sidelines of the Silveira House organised district impact assessment dialogue, Mberengwa Ward 10 Councillor, Chenjerai Shoko described the companys efforts as tilted towards community uplifting.\n\nSandawana Mine recent move to offer the roads rehab jobs to youths was a noble gesture. The initiative has significantly eased drugs and substance abuses.\n\nThe funds they are earning are also going a long way to fend for their families and shore up the local economic activities as they end up supporting downstream economic activities, he said.\n\nShoko also revealed that just recently, the company supported two awareness campaigns on sexual harassment and Gender Based Violence (GBV), which have gone a long way to eradicate vices whereby boys in the community were chasing after the young girls.\n\nFetty Gumbo, the headman for Mawovere Village, also commended the company for the people centered initiatives.\n\nThe companys pro-people approach continues to spread across the breadth and length of the Midlands Province, serving as a good example of best practices to fellow miners.\n\nThe initiative has gone a long way to revamp infrastructure while empowering the community at the same time, he said.\n\nSandawana is a member of Kuvimba Mining House and is expected to float more jobs and support the community with other initiatives once the internal financial situation improves.\n\n",
