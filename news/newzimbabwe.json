Companies were also allowed to swap their androids with substitutes when they could no longer compete, though each substitution came with a 10-minute penalty.\n\nThe first robot across the finish line, Tiangong Ultra  created by the Beijing Humanoid Robot Innovation Center  finished the route in two hours and 40 minutes. Thats nearly two hours short of the human world record of 56:42, held by Ugandan runner Jacob Kiplimo. The winner of the mens race on Saturday finished in 1 hour and 2 minutes.\n\nTang Jian, chief technology officer for the robotics innovation center, said Tiangong Ultras performance was aided by long legs and an algorithm allowing it to imitate how humans run a marathon.\n\nI dont want to boast but I think no other robotics firms in the West have matched Tiangongs sporting achievements, Tang said, according to the Reuters news agency, adding that the robot switched batteries just three times during the race.\n\nThe 1.8-meter robot came across a few challenges during the race, which involved the multiple battery changes. It also needed a helper to run alongside it with his hands hovering around his back, in case of a fall.\n\nMost of the robots required this kind of support, with a few tied to a leash. Some were led by a remote control.\n\nAmateur human contestants running in the other lane had no difficulty keeping up, with the curious among them taking out their phones to capture the robotic encounters as they raced along.\n\n",

For that reason, this Court has no basis to interfere with it, said Justice Mathonsi, who was sitting with Susan Mavangira and Joseph Musakwa.\n\nThe bench also noted that the court analysed the circumstances under which the offences were committed and noted that the appellants had engaged in a spree of criminal activities by moving around Gweru draining transformer oil and selling it to different individuals.\n\nThe court took note of the fact that the appellants had disadvantaged the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) by stealing a total of 11 530 litres of oil and causing damage to transformers amounting to $96 750.\n\nThe court further noted that the appellants were an organized criminal gang which operated under the cover of darkness and meticulously planned the execution of the crimes.\n\nAlso, their criminal escapades resulted in communities and industries suffering due to non-availability of electricity.\n\nAfter analysing the totality of the above considerations, the court found that a sentence based on purely the mandatory sentence of ten years would be draconian, abnormal and excessive to the extreme and induce an extreme sense of shock.\n\nThe court then exercised its discretion and arrived at a calculation of three years per count with some counts running concurrently.\n\nThis was done in the exercise of sentencing discretion which, as already stated, was improper but cannot be upset because, firstly it was favorable to the appellants and, secondly, none of the parties has challenged it, said the judges before dismissing the appeal.\n\nThe Chibunhes were charged along with two other individuals in the Provincial Magistrates Court in Gweru on 18 counts of violating section 60 A(3) of the Electricity Act [Chapter 13:19], as referenced with section 2 (3)(b) of the Electricity Amendment Act, enacted via Statutory Instrument No. 12 of 2007.\n\nAll counts involved vandalizing, cutting, damaging, destroying, or interfering with equipment used for transmitting, distributing, or supplying electricity.\n\nThe State established that from 11 February to 29 June 2013, the appellants, alongside two accomplices, orchestrated a coordinated criminal operation throughout Gweru that entailed the theft of transformer oil totaling 11,530 liters.\n\nThey caused widespread power outages and significant financial losses to the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA), the national electricity supplier, the state asserted.\n\nJacob pleaded not guilty to all charges, while Masimba admitted guilt to just one count but denied the others.\n\nEvidence demonstrated that the two, in collaboration with accomplices James Mahachi and Francis Madziva, used a red Honda Fit with registration number ACW 7466 to commit their crimes in Gweru.\n\nThe State argued that over a span of five months, primarily between 8:00 pm and 8:00 am, the Chibunhes specifically targeted at least 18 transformers, siphoning off a total of 11,530 liters of oil and causing damages estimated at no less than $96,750.\n\nThe stolen oil was then sold to omnibus operators with whom they had established connections.\n\n",

More so, the two trains are privately operated.\n\nWe, therefore, have no mandate to speak on behalf of the organisations involved. However, we join the nation in wishing those injured a speedy recovery, said the national carrier.\n\n",
