            "content": "By BBC\n\nA WOMAN in Australia has annulled her marriage after realising that a fake wedding ceremony she took part in for a social media stunt was in fact real.\n\nThe unknowing bride said her partner was a social media influencer who convinced her to take part in the ceremony as a prank for his Instagram account.\n\nShe only discovered the marriage was genuine when he tried to use it to gain permanent residency in Australia.\n\nA Melbourne judge granted the annulment after accepting the woman was tricked into getting married, in a judgement published on Thursday.\n\nThe bizarre case began in September 2023 when the woman met her partner on an online dating platform. They began seeing each other regularly in Melbourne, where they lived at the time.\n\nIn December that year, the man proposed to the woman and she accepted.\n\nTwo days later, the woman attended an event with the man in Sydney. She was told it would be a white party  where attendees would wear white-coloured clothing  and was told to pack a white dress.\n\nBut when they arrived, she was shocked and furious to find no other guests present except for her partner, a photographer, the photographers friend and a celebrant, according to her deposition quoted in court documents.\n\nSo, when I got there, and I didnt see anybody in white, I asked him, Whats happening?.\n\nAnd he pulled me aside, and he told me that hes organising a prank wedding for his social media, to be precise, Instagram, because he wants to boost his content, and wants to start monetising his Instagram page, she said.\n\nShe said she had accepted his explanation as he was a social media person who had more than 17,000 followers on Instagram. She also believed that a civil marriage would be valid only if it were held in a court.\n\nStill, she remained concerned. The woman rang a friend and voiced her worries, but the friend laughed it off and said it would be fine because, if it were real, they would have had to file a notice of intended marriage first, which they had not.\n\nReassured, the woman went through the ceremony where she and her partner exchanged wedding vows and kissed in front of a camera. She said she was happy at that time to play along to make it look real.\n\nTwo months later, her partner asked her to add him as a dependant in her application for permanent residency in Australia. Both of them are foreigners.\n\nWhen she told him she could not as they were technically not married, he then revealed that their Sydney wedding ceremony had been genuine, according to the womans testimony.\n\nThe woman later found their marriage certificate, and discovered a notice of intended marriage which had been filed the month before their Sydney trip  before they even got engaged  which she said she did not sign. According to the court documents, the signature on the notice bears little resemblance to the womans.\n\nIm furious with the fact that I didnt know that that was a real marriage, and the fact that he also lied from the beginning, and the fact that he also wanted me to add him in my application, she said.\n\nIn his deposition, the man claimed they had both agreed to these circumstances and that following his proposal the woman had agreed to marry him at an intimate ceremony in Sydney.\n\nThe judge ruled that the woman was mistaken about the nature of the ceremony performed and did not provide real consent to her participation in the marriage.\n\nShe believed she was acting. She called the event a prank. It made perfect sense for her to adopt the persona of a bride in all things at the impugned ceremony so as to enhance the credibility of the video depicting a legally valid marriage, he stated in the judgement.\n\nThe marriage was annulled October of 2024.\n\n",

It has become clear that his disappearance and harrowing ordeal and encounter with big game animals in Matusadonha Game Park, deep in the Zambezi Valley, has deeply affected not only him but also his family.\n\nAs part of their recommendations, the team has decided to temporarily move Tinotenda and his mother away from their home for a few days to provide them with a safer and calmer environment to prevent people from disturbing the recovery process, said the legislator.\n\nThe assessment team, she noted, will remain in the community for several days and also engage with school officials to prevent any discussions that could re-trigger trauma.\n\nAdditionally, the mental health team will return and be stationed in the community for not less than seven days to continue providing support and monitoring the boys and family progress.\n\nWith schools reopening soon, they will also engage the school authorities to ensure that when Tinotenda comes back to school, no interviews or discussions take place that might retraumatize him, said Murombedzi.\n\nThe mental health team still strongly advise against anyone conducting interviews at this stage as it may trigger emotional distress for the learner who is now proceeding to Grade Three.\n\n",

We conducted a search and rescue operation with the police and the mines sub-aqua unit but failed to find anyone after the report, it was a wild goose chase, said provincial mining director, Tariro Ndlovu.\n\nThese kinds of false alarms are criminal in that they do not just waste public resources but affect business as a lot would have been invested by those in charge of such businesses.\n\nIn the process of searching for the reported dead miners, police instead arrested 29 illegal gold panners who were operating about 400 metres below the surface.\n\nWe can confirm the arrest of 29 illegal gold panners during the search operation that was undertaken after news of a collapse at the mine was received, said the polices Gwanda District head one Ndlovu, before referring all questions to the public relations office.\n\nThe case is being handled under RRB number CR15/12/24 (DR28/12/24).\n\nIn a conversation with NewZimbabwe.com Councillor Simbarashe Lisimati also confirmed that neither an indication of a collapse nor victims had been found after the claim.\n\nVubachikwe Mine has since threatened legal action against Ncube who did not respond to requests for a comment on the matter.\n\nThis was an elaborate hoax, and this was being pushed by people who are supposed to be respectable people within our community.\n\nWhat saddened us was why eminent members of the community would spread such fake news, said Vubachikwe Mine spokesperson, Robert Mugabe.\n\n",
