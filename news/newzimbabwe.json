            "content": "By Annah Chibamu\n\nZANU PF MP and Parliaments Budget and Finance committee chairperson, Energy Mutodi has made a somersault over bribery allegations he levelled against Finance Permanent Secretary George Guvamatanga.\n\nEarlier, Mutodi made sensational claims against the Treasury head but suddenly, made a U-turn, apologising and retracting the statements.The legislator demanded that Guvamatanga be summoned by Parliament to clear his name following accusations of corruption involving alarming sums in dealings with contractors.In the X thread, the former deputy minister had accused Guvamatanga of siphoning millions of US dollars from State coffers through government contracted companies of between five and 10% per transaction or contract.The Parliament of Zimbabwe has received agonising reports that Guvamatanga is receiving 5% -10% for every payment done by the Treasury. GG as he is notoriously called has accumulated more than US$1 billion becoming the richest civil servant, said Mutodi.Finance Ministry Permanent Secretary George GuvamatangaHe alleged Contractors, Ministries and Departments refusing to pay Guvamatanga a kick back of at least 5% after receiving Treasury payments have been denied payments for several months even if the funds are budgeted for.Over the past six months, Parliament itself has struggled to operate after being denied its budgeted funds by George Guvamatanga. A civil servant earning less than $1,000 GG has more than 5,000 dairy cattle, dairy equipment and several mansions hence the proposed lifestyle audit.In a statement, Mutodi retracted the damning charges saying he had no iota of evidence to prove these allegations.This is not the first time the controversial lawmaker has made baseless allegations and forced to withdraw through lack of evidence.Following the publication of several tweets concerning flaws in the government payment system and particularly the conduct of Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Mr George Guvamatanga,I have reflected on my relationship with the Permanent Secretary anc following a telephone conversation with him, I have concluded that it is not in our interest to escalate the issues raised in those tweets.While the issues had been raised as a matter of principle and for the need to contribute meaningfully to this government especially by upholding the oversight function of Parliament provided for under Section 119 (3) of the Constitution of Zimbabwe, it is apparent to mention that proof beyond reasonable doubt under the circumstances would be impossible, making such a publication defamatory on the part of Mr George Guvamatanga.I, therefore, wish to issue an apology, unreservedly to Mr George Guvamatanga for the reputational damage the tweets may have caused and I have made instructions that the tweets be erased with immediate effect, Mutodi said.Mutodi will have to appear in Parliament to retract the allegations against Guvamatanga, which were also recorded in the parliamentary journal, The Hansard, this Thursday.\n\nEarlier, Mutodi made sensational claims against the Treasury head but suddenly, made a U-turn, apologising and retracting the statements.\n\nThe legislator demanded that Guvamatanga be summoned by Parliament to clear his name following accusations of corruption involving alarming sums in dealings with contractors.In the X thread, the former deputy minister had accused Guvamatanga of siphoning millions of US dollars from State coffers through government contracted companies of between five and 10% per transaction or contract.The Parliament of Zimbabwe has received agonising reports that Guvamatanga is receiving 5% -10% for every payment done by the Treasury.

If possible, retreat to a safe location, especially if you come across a pack of hyenas.\n\nWHAT happens when a hyena gatecrashes your boma dinner under the stars in the African bush?\n\nA South African traveller, @godly2.0, recently shared a moment on social media when an inquisitive hyena interrupted their dinner.The incident took place at Mana Pools in Zimbabwe, a remote safari destination renowned for its abundant wildlife and stunning natural landscapes, located along the Zambezi River, which forms part of the countrys border with Zambia.In a video shared on TikTok, a group of tourists can be seen dining outdoors with tables arranged in the open air.As they enjoy their meal, a hyena with sparkling eyes walks past one of the tables and locks eyes with a guest seated just a few centimetres away.The hyena then approaches the lodge patio, gazing at the guests before eventually walking away.It is important to note that no one was injured during this encounter, and tour guides were present on-site throughout the incident.Reacting to the video, this is what netizens had to say:@justmetheonetheonly commented: Fun fact: hyenas have a bite force that is stronger than a lion.Another user, @emmydee, remarked: Theyare trying to be strong, but I swear they are making silent prayers.@NicholasC90 added: Im too black for this.While @Mr stated: You can see everyone is ready to run deep inside, but theyre not going to tell each other.According to experts, if you ever encounter a hyena, do not run, as this may trigger its predatory instincts.Instead, stand your ground, make yourself appear as large and aggressive as possible, and try to speak calmly.It is also advised not to lie down or pretend to be dead, as this could make you a more appealing target.Back away slowly while continuing to face the hyena, and make loud noises to deter it.

It also suggested simplifying the Zimbabwean dollars exchange rate system, which it believes is inconsistent with a floating rate.\n\nHowever, the RBZ disagreed, asserting that its current approach provides essential flexibility for stabilizing the currency and strengthening reserves. The central bank emphasized that its involvement in the FX market is necessary to maintain exchange rate stability and questioned the IMFs recommendation to reduce its role.\n\nOn broader monetary policy, the IMF proposed phasing out Non-Negotiable Certificates of Deposit (NNCDs) and replacing them with tradable securities to improve liquidity management. The RBZ responded by outlining plans to reduce reliance on direct monetary tools and improve policy transmission, including the introduction of a Term Deposit Facility.\n\nAdditionally, the RBZ rejected IMF claims about exchange rate restrictions, stating that recent reforms have removed all formal restrictions and any remaining measures are internal procedures by financial institutions, not government-imposed.\n\nDespite the disagreements, the RBZ expressed openness to future adjustments, such as enhancing the FX market with greater transparency and exploring IMF technical assistance.\n\nThe central bank also reaffirmed its commitment to price stability and long-term reforms, with plans to transition to a mono-currency system by 2030.\n\n",

Attendees said that children as young as 13-years-old are being trapped in cycles of drug abuse, early marriages, and social instability  problems they believe are being worsened by the lack of mental health support.Speakers strongly condemned what they described as rampant corruption at the highest levels of government. Several participants accused President Emmerson Mnangagwa and members of his inner circle of enriching themselves while ordinary citizens suffer.The brain drain we are witnessing is not by choice, said Patson Muzuwa, one of the organisers.It is forced by the mismanagement and greed of a few elites who have destroyed the nations future.Attendees also reflected on the freedom of being able to gather and speak openly in the UK, contrasting it with the repression faced in Zimbabwe. Many expressed relief at having the space to criticise the regime without fear of police harassment.However, participants acknowledged the risks of their activism, warning that under the Patriotic Act of 2023, those who openly criticise the government abroad could face arrest and persecution if they return home.The meeting included contributions from Nobukhosi Dube, Melbar Dick, Luckmore Masanzu, Martha Mutima, Xoliso Sithole, Desire Kunaka and Blessing Tariro Makeyi.

Several participants accused President Emmerson Mnangagwa and members of his inner circle of enriching themselves while ordinary citizens suffer.The brain drain we are witnessing is not by choice, said Patson Muzuwa, one of the organisers.It is forced by the mismanagement and greed of a few elites who have destroyed the nations future.Attendees also reflected on the freedom of being able to gather and speak openly in the UK, contrasting it with the repression faced in Zimbabwe.

            "content": "BBC\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said he and his budget director will work out which Democrat Agencies to cut as the US government shutdown approached its third day.\n\nHe suggested Republicans should seize the opportunity to clear out dead wood and gave no hint of concessions to Democratic demands that legislation funding the government should include healthcare insurance subsidies.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, continued to blame each other for failing to keep federal agencies open.\n\nHundreds of thousands of federal workers are staying home, while others worked without pay. Some federal attractions closed to visitors while others, including the Statue of Liberty, stayed open.\n\nAnalysts dont expect either side to budge without pressure from everyday Americans, most of whom have yet to feel direct impacts on their lives.\n\nIt was unclear exactly what Trump could decide in Thursdays meeting with Russell Vought, director of the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB).\n\nWhen Congress fails to keep the US government open, the OMB director works with the president to pick which government activities should stop and which are essential.\n\nIt then gives directions to federal agencies about which employees to place on furlough, which means unpaid leave.\n\nOn the first day of the shutdown, Vought said the White House had moved to pause or cancel billions of dollars in funding meant for Democratic states, including $18bn (13.4bn) in infrastructure projects in New York  home of both Senator Chuck Schumer and the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nBoth sides must come together to pass legislation if the government is to reopen.\n\nRepublicans need eight Democratic senators to vote with them, while Democrats need 13 Republicans to side with them. Only three Democrats joined with Republicans on the last failed vote in the Senate on Wednesday.\n\nLawmakers are expected to try again on Friday afternoon to resolve the impasse with a vote in the Senate.\n\nRepublicans want to pass a funding measure without anything else attached, but Democrats want to include a renewal of health insurance subsidies for low-income individuals set to expire at the end of the year.\n\nIn duelling press conferences on Capitol Hill on Thursday, neither party appeared willing to give ground.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson called Democrats selfish, dubbed it the Democrat shutdown, and said he would not negotiate on adding insurance subsidies  or other measures  to government funding.\n\nJeffries accused Republicans of not wanting to provide working-class Americans with healthcare and said Trumps threats to fire more federal workers were pointless. He noted: They have been firing federal employees all along.\n\nLee Miringoff, director of the Marist University Institute for Public Opinion, said his polling suggested Americans were largely split down party lines when it came to assigning fault for the shutdown.\n\nMajorities of both Democratic and Republican respondents to his polls blamed the other party for the shutdown, he said, while 41% of independents said both parties shared the blame equally.\n\nBoth of the parties have mastered the finger-pointing, and all were left with is a growing number of people think the country is headed in the wrong direction, Miringoff said.\n\nHe expected Americans to put pressure on Congress to reopen the government  but not until they see the impact of a shutdown on their own lives.\n\nAs politicians traded barbs, US government services started to grind to a halt and thousands of federal workers stayed home.\n\nAbout 750,000 federal workers were expected to take unpaid leave, according to an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\n\nFederal employees deemed essential continued to work, though without pay. They include more than 200,000 law enforcement officers.\n\nAir traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) workers are considered essential, so air travel will not immediately be affected.\n\nDuring the last shutdown these employees increasingly began to call in sick, leading to some delays at major airports.\n\nTourists were turned away from museums in Washington and New York, including at Federal Hall in Manhattan.\n\nA manager told the BBC the building was closed like other federal monuments.\n\nGeorge Washington, the first US president, took the oath of office there in 1789. Now a museum, the historic building also was home to the first Congress and Supreme Court.\n\nBut not all monuments are closed.\n\nElsewhere in New York, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island remained open, thanks to the leadership of President Donald J Trump, a Department of the Interior spokesperson told the BBC.\n\nThe Smithsonian, which includes more than a dozen museums and attractions that drew nearly 17 million visitors last year, told the BBC it had enough money to stay open for a week.\n\n",
