Thebiggest fallswere recorded forheavyindustrialsand cash, according to Bank of America analysts.\n\nZimbabweanPGMproduction slipped 10% to 119 koz, largely reflecting significant destocking of semi-processed material at Unki, owned by Valterra.\n\nOutput from Zimplats,Zimbabweslargest producer, edged lower owing to furnace repairs.\n\nThus, PGM supply from Zimbabwe is expected to contract by 4% year-on-year to 493 koz, retreating from the record level achieved in 2024.\n\nThe decline primarily reflects the absence of a drawdown of semi-finished stock that boosted last years volumes, said WIPC.\n\n",

The hosts, under recently appointed manager Romanian Marian Marinica, who replaced Michael Nees a few weeks ago, fell behind when Mohamed Gouda scored on just nine minutes.\n\nHowever, Munashe Garananga equalised midway through the first half, with Belgian Pro League club Mechelen winger Bill Antonio grabbing a winner on 74 minutes to seal a long-awaited triumph. Writing on Instagram, then looking ahead to the Africa Cup of Nations which sees Zimbabwe take on Angola, Egypt and South Africa in Group B, the competition starting on December 21, with the first game against Egypt on Saturday, December 22, Nakamba believes the victory was a huge momentum going into the tournament.\n\nHe said: A BIG THANK YOU to all Zimbabweans who were rallying behind us back from home, all over the world and those in Qatar, Saudi Arabia who came out in numbers to support us during the international friendly matches. Without you, we feel incomplete. Thank you to the ZIFA leadership, led by the Zifa president Nqobile Magwizi for organising such kind of international friendlies matches. Thank you to the Minister of Tourism, Honourable Barbara Rwodzi, who took time to visit the team in camp and to watch us play against Algeria in Saudi Arabia on Thursday, even though we disappointingly lost that match 3-1.\n\nLastly, I want to thank the corporate world and all football stakeholders, we dearly need your support in everything we do, kindly chip in, help and support us. The victory against Qatar brings confidence and renewed zeal within the squad, especially with just a few weeks left before the prestigious AFCON tournament. As players, we always play with our hearts out, I believe with your support and if we all pull in one direction, we will get it right. This is the moment we need your support the most. Thank you, Zimbabweans.\n\n",

This is affecting peoples livelihoods. You would find that people are just relocated without improving their livelihoods.\n\nWhat is the government policy in terms of people who are being displaced by mining activities, where you find, them being relocated to areas which are not conducive? he said.\n\nHis concerns come just two months after President Emmerson Mnangagwa directed Parliament to expedite the long-overdue Mines and Minerals Bill to address ongoing disputes between miners, farmers, and communities.\n\nResponding to the issue, Mines and Mining Development Deputy Minister responsible for Oil and Gas Research and other Strategic Minerals Exploration, Caleb Makwiranzou, acknowledged the challenges.\n\nThe Deputy Minister said, Before giving permission to miners, we require a report, which is called the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which is a report, which looks at the community which is going to be affected, and where they are going to be relocated. If they going to receive houses where they are going to be relocated, then after getting that report, that is where we allow mining companies to go ahead.\n\nMakwiranzou also highlighted provisions in the new law.\n\nI want to inform this House that the new law [H. B. 1, 2025] allows that if someone has their field or their farm and there is a need for mining to be done in that field, that person is given the first option. The person is asked whether they allow the miners, and then they can discuss with whoever wants to mine if there is an allocation of shares. The person can then be given shares.\n\nOn the other hand, if that person is to be relocated, it should be consensual. They must give consent because the previous law was causing disputes where there was conflict between the Minerals Act and the Agricultural Act, said Makwiranzou.\n\nHowever, Chief Chikwaka argued that, in reality, no environmental impact assessments were being conducted before mining begins.\n\nThere is no Environmental Impact Assessment, which is being done. You would find that miners are just coming into the community. They start drilling in peoples fields. They start mining and excavating in peoples fields and leave such fields open.\n\nThey do not cover the pits and the original farmer cannot farm on his land because there are pits. There is a need for consultation with stakeholders, Chief Chikwaka said.\n\nMakwiranzou stressed that operating without an EIA is illegal, adding that government would send inspectors to the affected communities and block the mining activities.\n\n",

Among them is HC 2312/24  Collin Zondai Makoni vs The State, which the writer says came [before] Justice Munangati despite the fact that it was from her law firm, involving lawyers Skumbuzo Mpofu and Skyvaine Vongai Tendere. This matter is pending decision pronouncement, the letter notes.\n\nThe whistle-blower also cites Thelma Chimbanga vs L Gono Enterprises (HC 1518/24), which they say was heard by the same judge despite originating from the same law firm, and is still awaiting a set down.\n\nAnother flagged case is Blue Star Logistics vs Harare Motorways (HC 8108/24), where Thabani Mpofu is representing the Applicant, with the author adding: I believe this anomaly is being overlooked since Thabani Mpofu and Webster Chiikwanha are the best of friends.\n\nThe author insists that Justice Munangati Manongwa should not hear any matters instructed to Advocate Mpofu by Munangati and Associates legal practitioners, urging ZACC to intervene because these allegations, which are very serious in nature be investigated so as to avoid prejudice to other litigants.\n\nThe writer further notes that this is not their first complaint to ZACC: Kindly note that I once wrote to your good office again on the 24th of June 2024.\n\n",

            "content": "WHO\n\nZimbabwe is intensifying efforts to improve the prevention, early detection and treatment of breast and cervical cancers by integrating cancer and chronic disease services into primary health care. This approach aims to bring essential health services closer to communities and ensure women have equitable access to quality care.\n\nCervical cancer accounts for almost 41% of all cancers among women in the country, followed by breast cancer at 13%, according to Zimbabwes National Cancer Registry. To address the burden, the Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC), with support from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and partners, is implementing measures to strengthen integrated cancer services across the health system.\n\nIn July 2025, WHO handed over medical equipment worth US$20,000 to the MoHCC to support service delivery at the primary health level. The specialised equipment can be used to screen for noncommunicable diseases, including diabetes and hypertension.\n\nBuilding on this support, the MoHCC and WHO held training-of-trainers sessions in August 2025 for health professionals from Mashonaland West and Matabeleland South provinces.\n\nMany cancers are preventable. Let us spread the word and let all women know about it, says Esther Ngaru, one of the trainees and reproductive health officers at MOHCC.\n\nTwenty-five health professionals were trained on integrating the management of breast and cervical cancers, mental health and chronic diseases, as well as coordinated provision of prevention, screening, diagnosis, treatment and care services.\n\nThe trainers are disseminating this knowledge to frontline health workers to strengthen prevention, screening, and treatment at the community level.\n\nThanks to this training, our screening will be more effective than ever, says Audrey Musorowembudzi, a nurse at Hurungwe Rural Health Centre. At my facility, I will share this knowledge with my colleagues so that no woman is left behind.\n\nIn Karoi, a town in Mashonaland West Province, seven primary health care nurses and village health workers have already benefited from these trainings.\n\nVillage health worker Angeline Mukusa from Chigumbura Village says she will use the lessons learned to raise awareness in her community. Cancer is a major concern where I live, she says. I will encourage early detection and HPV vaccination for girls. Cancer is treatable if detected early and this will save many lives.\n\nAccording to the districts medical officer Dr Munyaradzi Chidaushe this approach is already improving service delivery. This work is transformative. Village health workers can identify and refer women suspected of breast or cervical cancer more easily. Prevention is key to protecting communities, he says.\n\nThese activities are part of the Womens Integrated Care for Cancer Services (WICS) project, led by the WHO Regional Office for Africa with support from Roche. Implemented in Cte dIvoire, Kenya and Zimbabwe, the project aims to strengthen integrated breast and cervical cancer services within primary health care. Zimbabwe was selected because its established cervical cancer programme provides a foundation for integrating additional services for cancer and chronic diseases.\n\nThrough the commitment of health workers, the leadership of MOHCC, and the support of WHO and partners, Zimbabwe is taking a decisive step towards reducing the burden of breast and cervical cancer, says Dr Desta Tiruneh WHO Representative in Zimbabwe. These efforts bring the country closer to a future where no woman dies from a preventable or treatable cancer and where health systems truly serve communities with equity and compassion.\n\n",
