            "content": "By BBC News\n\nTHE Duke of Sussex has told the BBC he would love a reconciliation with the Royal Family, in an emotional interview in which he said he was devastated at losing a legal challenge over his security in the UK.\n\nPrince Harry said the King wont speak to me because of this security stuff, but that he did not want to fight any more and did not know how much longer my father has.\n\nThe prince spoke to BBC News in California after losing an appeal over the levels of security he and his family are entitled to while in the UK.\n\nBuckingham Palace said: All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.\n\nAfter Fridays court ruling, the prince said: I cant see a world in which I would bring my wife and children back to the UK at this point.\n\nThere have been so many disagreements between myself and some of my family, he added, but had now forgiven them.\n\nI would love reconciliation with my family. Theres no point continuing to fight any more, life is precious, said Prince Harry, who said the dispute over his security had always been the sticking point.\n\nThe prince had wanted to overturn changes to his security that were introduced in 2020 as he stepped down as a working royal and moved to the United States.\n\nSaying that he felt let down, he described his court defeat as a good old-fashioned establishment stitch up and blamed the Royal Household for influencing the decision to reduce his security.\n\nAsked whether he had asked the King to intervene in the dispute over security, Prince Harry said: I never asked him to intervene  I asked him to step out of the way and let the experts do their jobs.\n\nThe prince said his treatment during the process of deciding his security had uncovered my worst fears.\n\nHe said of the decision: Im devastated  not so much as devastated with the loss that I am about the people behind the decision, feeling as though this is okay. Is it a win for them?\n\nHe continued: Im sure there are some people out there, probably most likely the people that wish me harm, [who] consider this a huge win.\n\nPrince Harry said the decision to remove his automatic security entitlement impacts him every single day, and has left him in a position where he can only safely return to the UK if invited by the Royal Family  as he would get sufficient security in those circumstances.\n\nThe prince said changes to his security status in 2020 had impacted not just him, but his wife and, later, his children too.\n\nHe went on to say: Everybody knew that they were putting us at risk in 2020 and they hoped that me knowing that risk would force us to come back.\n\nBut then when you realise that didnt work, do you not want to keep us safe?\n\nWhether youre the government, the Royal Household, whether youre my dad, my family  despite all of our differences, do you not want to just ensure our safety?\n\nAsked whether he missed the UK, he added: I love my country, I always have done, despite what some people in that country have done and I think that its really quite sad that I wont be able to show my children my homeland.\n\nPrince Harry said he would not be seeking a further legal challenge, saying Fridays ruling had proven that there was no way to win this through the courts.\n\nI wish someone had told me that beforehand, he said, adding that the ruling had been a surprise.\n\nHe continued: This, at the heart of it, is a family dispute, and it makes me really, really sad that were sitting here today, five years later, where a decision that was made most likely, in fact I know, to keep us under the roof.\n\nHarrys emotional avalanche hits the Royal Family\n\nPrince Harry spoke to the BBC shortly after losing his latest legal challenge against the UK government over the level of security he and his family are entitled to when visiting.\n\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed the princes case, which hinged on how an official committee made the decision to remove his eligibility for automatic, full-scale protection in line with what other senior royals receive.\n\nOn Friday, the court ruled that Prince Harry had made powerful arguments about the level of threat he and his family face, but said his sense of grievance did not translate into a legal argument.\n\nHis legal complaint centred around a committee called the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec), which authorises security for senior royals on behalf of the Home Office, and was chaired at the time by Sir Richard Mottram.\n\nUnder the committees regulations, Prince Harry argued, his case should have been put before Ravecs Risk Management Board (RMB), which would have assessed the threats to his and familys security  but that did not happen.\n\nOn Friday, senior judges said the committee had diverged from policy when making its 2020 decision over the princes security, but concluded it had been sensible to do so because of the complexity of his circumstances.\n\nPrince Harry said his jaw hit the floor when he found out a representative of the Royal Household sat on the Ravec committee, and claimed Fridays ruling had proved its decision-making process was more influenced by the Royal Household than by legal constraints.\n\nHe claimed there had been interference by the Royal Household in the 2020 decision, which he said resulted in his status as the most at-risk royal being downgraded to the least at risk overnight.\n\nSo, one does question how that is even possible and also the motive behind that at the time, he added.\n\nPrince Harry called on UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to intervene in his security case, and to overhaul how the Ravec committee operates.\n\nIn a statement released later on Friday, the prince said he would write to Cooper to ask her to urgently examine the matter and review the Ravec process.\n\n",

Could you imagine if I had kids with Paris Hilton? How many hotels Id have now? Think about that  the Hilton. I think yall staying at the Hilton right now. The Edition Hotels is a Hilton.\n\nHe also compared Kardashian to the late Virgil Abloh, a backhanded compliment if there ever was one.\n\nParis Hilton had the vision, and thats what happened, Ye added.\n\nKim was like the Virgil [Abloh]. Kim was like Paris Hiltons Virgil. Whew.\n\nWhile Yes out here rewriting the family tree in his head, Hilton is living her real-life fairytale and couldnt be more unbothered. On Wednesday, she took to Instagram Stories to show off her rooftop hangout with sister Nicky Hilton, celebrating her latest milestone.\n\nSo proud of my 30th fragrance, Iconic, she wrote. Hiltons got 30 perfumes under her designer belt. The womans perfume empire is practically a shelf-breaker.\n\nAnd in true Hilton style, she stepped behind the DJ booth with a bejewelled hairbrush-mic and lip-synced to her surprisingly well-loved 2006 bop, Stars Are Blind. A hit that critics once raised eyebrows at, but has since aged into a Y2K pop cult classic.\n\nAs for Ye, well, weve seen this pattern before. Hes got four children with Kardashian, and yet somehow cant stop dragging her into his latest rants.\n\nAt this point, were just waiting to see who makes it into his next stream-of-consciousness saga. One things for sure: Hiltons not interested in being part of Yes what if multiverse. Shes too busy being iconic.\n\nShame, he missed that memo.\n\n",

We are also focusing on the entire value and supply chains, from chemicals for our tanneries to components for our shoes and leather boots. China produces all of these, and we want strong trade relations to develop our leather value chain, he told Xinhua recently.\n\nThe Chinese market has a strong appetite for leather crafts such as belts, said Zvinondiramba, also secretary of the Bulawayo Leather Cluster (BLC), a group of businesses and individuals promoting the leather industry in Bulawayo, Zimbabwes second-largest city.\n\nZimbabwe has a long-standing tradition of leather craft. The sector benefits from the countrys rich livestock and diverse wildlife resources.\n\nLocal producers use a mix of handcrafting techniques and modern machinery to make products such as bags, shoes, belts and wallets. Unlike mass-produced leather goods made with industrial machinery and standardized designs, crafted leather products feature personalized designs, often made with hand-held tools.\n\nWe have the best hides, the best animals. And we also have a strong historical background in leather crafting. The skill set and infrastructure are already in place. We have those trained in manufacturing, as well as those with natural talent for crafting, Zvinondiramba said.\n\nHe added that other products in the leather value chain, such as raw hides, can also be exported to China.\n\nWe are also looking at promoting our abattoirs in China. With the worlds largest population, China presents a lucrative market for our meat products, especially beef, which is also part of our value chain, he said.\n\nOnce a major regional producer of leather goods, especially shoes, Zimbabwes leather sector is now undergoing a revival.\n\nJoseph Mukondo, a marketing representative for BLC, said that while small-scale producers are playing a vital role in reviving the industry, they face stiff competition from imported second-hand and synthetic footwear.\n\nSo far, the leather industry is struggling due to the influx of cheap synthetic leather imports and second-hand shoes. We are trying to win back customers by promoting genuine leather, but with the current economic hardships, people tend to buy two or three pairs of shoes for 10 U.S. dollars instead of a single genuine leather pair for 20, he said.\n\nWe used to have large foreign companies making shoes in Zimbabwe. Today, most activities are carried out by local start-ups. That is why we are turning to China to help our start-ups grow into major players in the leather sector, Zvinondiramba said.\n\n",

These include child support grants, disability grants, old age pensions, and more. But a common question that arises especially among migrants is: Can Zimbabwean immigrants avail SASSA grants?\n\nThis article aims to provide a clear, updated, and SEO-friendly explanation of whether Zimbabwean nationals living in South Africa are eligible for SASSA grants, what types of permits are required, and what alternatives are available for those who are not eligible.\n\nThe South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) is responsible for distributing social grants to help vulnerable individuals and families meet their basic needs. Grants include:\n\nThese grants are primarily meant for South African citizens, but certain categories of non-citizens may also qualify.\n\nCan Zimbabwean Immigrants Qualify for SASSA Grants?\n\nThe short answer is: Not all Zimbabwean immigrants are eligible for SASSA grants, but some may qualify under specific conditions. You can alsoCheck Sassa Statusfor eligibility.\n\nTo qualify for most SASSA grants, an applicant must meet the following criteria:\n\nZimbabwean immigrants in South Africa fall into different legal categories. Heres how that affects their SASSA eligibility:\n\nZimbabweans who have been granted refugee status (under Section 24 of the Refugees Act) are eligible for most SASSA grants. Refugees are treated the same as citizens under South African law for social security purposes.\n\nZEP holders are not eligible for SASSA grants. This is because the ZEP is a special temporary permit that does not confer permanent residency or refugee status.\n\nEven if a ZEP holder lives and works in South Africa legally, they do not meet the criteria for social grants.\n\nAsylum seekers holding Section 22 permits are also not eligible for most SASSA grants. This is because their status is temporary, and their applications for refugee status are still being processed.\n\nIf a Zimbabwean has been granted permanent residency, they become eligible to apply for SASSA grants, just like South African citizens. However, permanent residency is a long and complex process.\n\nSASSA Grants Zimbabweans May Qualify For\n\nHere are some grants that Zimbabwean immigrantsmayaccess under certain conditions:\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the SRD grant (R350 grant) was introduced. Initially, it was only for South African citizens, but later expanded to include refugees and asylum seekers with valid documentation from Home Affairs.\n\nWhile this grant was temporary, the SRD R370 grant has replaced it. As of 2024, it is still limited to:\n\nZimbabwean refugees or permanent residents with children may apply for the Child Support Grant, provided:\n\nIf a Zimbabwean refugee or permanent resident wants to apply for a SASSA grant, they will need:\n\nOnly recognized refugees and permanent residents can receive grantsnot all immigrants.\n\nThe ZEP (Zimbabwean Exemption Permit) is not equivalent to permanent residency and does not make the holder eligible for SASSA grants.\n\nSince Zimbabwean Exemption Permit holders are not eligible for SASSA grants, here are a few alternatives:\n\nOrganizations likeDoctors Without Borders (MSF),Scalabrini Centre, andGift of the Giversprovide food, housing, and basic needs support to migrants in need.\n\nZEP holders are legally allowed to work in South Africa. Seeking employment or freelance opportunities can help sustain financial needs.\n\nSome Zimbabwean community associations and churches in South Africa provide assistance to struggling families.\n\nNo. Work permits, including the Zimbabwean Exemption Permit (ZEP), do not qualify you for SASSA grants.\n\nOnly if they areSouth African citizensorrefugees. Children born to ZEP holders are not automatically granted citizenship.\n\nCan asylum seekers from Zimbabwe apply for the R370 grant?\n\nOnly under special temporary rulings. Most are not eligible unless otherwise stated by SASSA or government policy.\n\nWhile Zimbabwean immigrants contribute significantly to South African society, their eligibility for SASSA grants is limited. Only those with refugee status or permanent residency may legally access these social welfare benefits. ZEP holders and asylum seekers remain excluded, though they may access help through NGOs and community support networks.\n\nIf youre unsure about your status or rights, consult with legal aid organizations or visit your local SASSA office for accurate guidance.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nMDC leader, Douglas Mwonzora, says if the country decides to press ahead with the third term extension agenda for President Emmerson Mnangagwa, an estimated US$40 million will be gobbled from the fiscus.\n\nSections of the ruling Zanu PF party are pushing for an extension of Mnangagwas tenure beyond the constitutionally stipulated two five-year terms. Mnangagwa, who is currently serving his final term, insists he is a constitutionalist and will step aside in 2028.\n\nAt the height of the calls, another faction resisting the proposal fronted by war vet Blessed Geza is backing Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, the favourite to take over from Mnangagwa. Geza has since called for demonstrations and an indefinite stay-away, which was recently ignored by citizens hard-hit by poverty and cannot afford to stay at home in a highly informal Zimbabwe\n\nSpeaking to NewZimbabwe.com on the sidelines of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) organised Workers Day Commemorations Thursday, Mwonzora criticised forces angled towards extending Mnangagwas term of office.\n\nOpposition MDC leader Douglas Mwonzora\n\nWe are totally opposed to the issue of the third term. We must stick to the Constitution, which says the President must serve for a maximum of 10 years. President Mnangagwa must be even more grateful for the fact that he has been in the Cabinet since 1980.\n\nApart from that, on expiry of his current term, he would have served in office for a good 11 years, because he completed one year that was left by the former late president.\n\nIn the event that he faces no resistance to amending the constitution for a third term. It means we have to conduct two referendums, and a referendum is an election that will cost US$ 20 million each. There is no need for that, he said.\n\nAsked whether he was considering backing Gezas demonstrations to align with the anti-third term agenda, Mwonzora rubbished the war vets efforts, saying supporting such an initiative will only perpetuate Zanu-PFs hold on power.\n\nHe said MDCs agenda has nothing to do with changing the leader of ZANU-PF midway.\n\nAdded Mwonzora, That is not for us to say, because we are wiser(3:29)to know that if we are to change the president of ZANU-PF today, he will be replaced by a(3:36)president of ZANU-PF. So there will not be any change of government, which is what we(3:41)want as the opposition.\n\nWe want a change of government. So the internal views within ZANU-PFare not for us. But where we agree with him and other people is that there should not be a third term. But on the issue of whether they want to change their president, its up to them as ZANU-PF.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nTHE Election Resource Centre (ERC) has called for the introduction of legislation allowing employees to take a leave of absence on polling day to vote, saying this removes electoral participation barriers.\n\nIn a workers day message, ERC urged African authorities to ensure workers are actively included in democratic processes by addressing barriers to their participation in elections.\n\nSpecifically, the ERC recommends the introduction of provisions enabling employees to take a leave of absence for a specified period on polling day, specifically for casting a vote.\n\nThis aligns with the principle of removing practical barriers to voting. The ERC is concerned that limited time away from work on election days may inadvertently infringe upon workers voting rights.\n\nThe ERC emphasises the active inclusion of workers, a significant group, in this vision of participatory democracy.\n\nIn Zimbabwes 2023 general elections, some working-class citizens were unable to vote due to the limited time allocated for casting their ballots.\n\nVoting was delayed, particularly in Harare, where most polling stations failed to open on the first day.\n\nAs a result, many workers could not return to vote the following day because they did not have leave days available.\n\nERC emphasised that workers active inclusion is vital to participatory democracy.\n\nTherefore, the ERC calls on the relevant authorities across Africa, including Election Management Bodies (EMBs), Parliaments, and Ministries responsible for Justice and Elections, to proactively address this challenge.\n\nWe urge these bodies to review existing legislation and/or enact new regulations to effectively safeguard the rights of workers to vote on election days, ERC said.\n\nThe elections watchdog also called for a review of the definition of persons who may vote by post or through special voting mechanisms in the relevant Electoral Acts.\n\nIt also suggested the revision of electoral laws to expand early voting access for groups such as people with disabilities, senior citizens, and expectant mothers, while calling for consideration of early voting as an alternative to proxy voting and sought to include voters such as polling personnel and essential service workers.\n\n",
