It is the first and most critical stage of mining, involving mapping, surveys and exploratory drilling to identify potential ore bodies before mining decisions are made.\n\nSpeaking toNewZimbabwe.comon the sidelines of the inaugural Zimbabwe Gold Investment Conference on Monday, Ernst & Young Associate Partner Dr Godknows Njowasaid Zimbabwes exploration spending remains far too low.\n\nErnst & Young Associate Partner Dr Godknows Njowa\n\nIn terms of exploration, Zimbabwe spends only 0.2% of annual global exploration expenditure, and within Africa, we contribute just 2%. Yet Africas total share is around 9%, he said.\n\nSo this shows that in Zimbabwe, we are not spending enough money on exploration. During my presentation, I gave the example of Canada, which is the highest spender in the world at about 20% of the annual global exploration budget.\n\nNjowa warned that Zimbabwe continues to lose opportunities, saying the country has the potential to double its current gold outputif it adequately explores and develops new deposits.\n\nFor decision makers,both government and private sector,more money must be allocated to exploration. Gold mining companies globally are making super profits because prices are at levels not seen in the past 30 or 40 years.\n\nSo some of that money should be reinvested into exploration. You need to spend between US$50 and US$80 per ounceof what you produce on exploration, he added.\n\n",

            "content": "Hackster\n\nRemoteness from care is a major challenge to health services worldwide. Half of the worlds population resides in rural areas, but only 36% of the global nursing workforce lives there. This means infant mortality, maternal death, and poor health outcomes are much prevalent in rural areas than in urban locations.\n\nTelehealth (healthcare delivery via electronic means) has helped in overcoming some barriers, but it requires internet access. One in three people globally will still live in a rural area by 2050, and there is a critical need for healthcare access solutions that are built to work in rural areas.\n\nIn rural Zimbabwe, a person who is sick might walk 15 to 20 kilometres to reach a clinic.ZimbosAbantu a social enterprise in Harare, Zimbabwes capital has a fleet of mobile clinics that offer medical services to vulnerable populations in the rural and peri-urban areas of the city. Its goal is to reduce the distance that women, youth, and children walk to access primary healthcare from 15km to 3km.\n\nZimbosAbantu roughly translates to Zimbabwean people. It operates five mobile clinics, offering services like dental care, maternal health, immunisation, eye care, and nutrition education.\n\nEach mobile clinic has a wind turbine and solar panels generating enough power for a 190-litre vaccine freezer. They are equipped with examination rooms, vital monitoring machines, diagnostic kits, and medications. They operate 12 hours a day and are staffed full-time by health professionals. Each clinic serves an average of 18-20 patients per day, or about 1000 patients per month.\n\nThe social enterprise was founded by Chiedza and Tawanda Mushawedu in 2021. Chiedza serves as the organizations executive director and previously worked for a private hospital. While working there, she saw people suffering from undiagnosed chronic conditions and dying from treatable conditions, simply because care was out of reach.\n\nZimbosAbantu offers a subsidised healthcare scheme to solve affordability disparities. Men, women, and youth are organized in groups of 10 or 20, and each member pays about $3 every month for access to healthcare, drugs, and other benefits. About 1,000 people are currently enrolled in the scheme.\n\nRemoteness from care is a wide-scale problem that needs a similarly-sized solution. ZimbosAbantu has recently added more vehicles to its fleet and expanded its operations to a second province. In a conversation with Africa Business Radio, Chiedza admits that there is still a large gap to be addressed, and ZimbosAbantu is a drop in the ocean. She emphasizes the need for investors and partners to help expand the organizations reach and impact.\n\nZiplineis another company working to improve medical access in Africa, but with autonomous drones.\n\n",
