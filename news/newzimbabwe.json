            "content": "By Reuters\n\nWASHINGTON  Republican President Donald Trump said on Sunday he was not joking about seeking a third presidential term, which is barred by the U.S. Constitution, but that it was too early to think about doing so.\n\nTrump, who took office on January 20 for his second, non-consecutive White House term, has made allusions to seeking a third one but addressed it directly in a telephone interview with NBC News.\n\nNo, Im not joking. Im not joking, Trump said, but it is far too early to think about it.\n\nThere are methods which you could do it, as you know, he said, declining to elaborate on specific methods.\n\nU.S. presidents are limited to two four-year terms, consecutive or not, according to the 22nd Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.\n\nA proposal to overturn a constitutional amendment requires a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress and ratification by the legislatures of three-fourths of the 50 U.S. states.\n\nSome Trump allies have floated the idea of keeping Trump in the White House beyond 2028, and the president has also brought up the idea on a number of occasions in a manner that seemed to poke at his political opponents.\n\nTrump, who at 78 was the oldest U.S. president at the time of his inauguration, would be 82 if he took on another four-year term following the November 2028 election.\n\nGeorge Washington in 1796 set the precedent for a two-term presidency, a self-imposed limit that was observed by most U.S. presidents for more than 140 years until Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1940.\n\nRoosevelt, a Democrat who was president during the Great Depression and World War 2, broke tradition and served a third term, then died months into his fourth term in 1945. This paved the way for the amendment on term limits in 1951.\n\nLongtime Trump adviser Steve Bannon said in a March 19 interview with NewsNation that he believes Trump will run again in 2028. Bannon said he and others are looking into ways to make that happen, including examining the definition of a term limit.\n\nWere working on it, Bannon said.\n\n",

They will be back in court on April 11.\n\nCircumstances are that sometime in April 2023, the now deceased Princess Shoko aged four, and her six-year-old sister, Susan Mandaza, were left in the custody of aunt and her husband in Zvimba.\n\nThe childrens mother Nomsa Sibanda is a sister to Alista.\n\nUpon her return to South Africa, Nomsa left the children in the care of the couple who allegedly started to abuse the two children, subjecting them to beatings and denying them food.\n\nCourt heard that in July 2023, Princess Shoko succumbed to injuries inflicted on her and died on July 23, 2023.\n\nIn a bid to cover up their heinous crime, accused persons allegedly placed the childs corpse in a sack, and shoved it in the boot of a Honda Fit vehicle before driving to Kuwadzana Extension, where they dumped the body in a stream.\n\nThe court heard how the accused persons informed Nomsa Sibanda of her daughters death but failed to provide her with a satisfactory explanation.\n\nIt was further heard that the deceased childs mother returned to Zimbabwe and, on August 1, 2023, reported a missing persons case to ZRP Dzivarasekwa.\n\nThe very next day, the slain girls body was found in the stream in Dzvivarasekwa, Harare.\n\nThe remains were positively identified and taken to Parirenyatwa Hospital for a post-mortem. The pathologists findings were inconclusive as toxicology results were still pending.\n\nFearing arrest, the Zvivi and his wife fled to South Africa, but the matter was widely circulated on social media leading to their arrest and eventual extradition.\n\nTakudzwa Jambawu prosecuted the matter.\n\n",

            "content": "By Peter Fabricius l The Daily Maverick\n\nTENSIONS are rising in Zimbabwe over President Emmerson Mnangagwas evident intention to remain in power after his second term ends in 2028.\n\nZimbabwes constitution explicitly prohibits serving more than two terms, but there are suspicions that Mnangagwa intends somehow to circumvent that provision.\n\nThis is fuelling criticism not just from the political opposition and civil society, but even the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union-Patriotic Front (Zanu-PF) party.\n\nIn particular, Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga is against the move. He has been waiting to be passed the baton  which Mnangagwa supposedly promised him  when together they ousted former president Robert Mugabe in November 2017 in a military takeover.\n\nAmong the rising chorus of critics calling for Mnangagwa to go is a strong faction of war veterans, a key constituency in the Zanu-PF establishment who back Chiwenga. Led by Blessed Bombshell Runesu Geza, the faction plans an uprising against him on 31 March 2025. Geza was a Member of Parliament and a member of Zanu-PFs Central Committee until he was expelled for fanning factionalism.\n\nGeza has gone into hiding and the government is cracking down on anyone transmitting his calls. Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) journalist Blessed Mhlanga was arrested after he broadcast Gezas interviews on AMHs Heart and Soul TV. He has been denied bail twice. Others have gone into hiding.\n\nThis clampdown has provoked widespread criticism in and beyond Zimbabwe.\n\nIdriss Ali Nassah, a senior Human Rights Watch Africa researcher, demanded the immediate release and withdrawal of charges against Mhlanga, which showed the rights to freedom of expression and the media are under serious threat in Zimbabwe.\n\nAgitation\n\nThe agitation dates back to August 2024 when Zanu-PFs National Congress passed Resolution 1, saying Mnangagwas terms as party head and Zimbabwes president should be extended beyond 2028 to 2030  and that the countrys constitution be amended accordingly.\n\nMnangagwa insists he is a constitutionalist and will step down in 2028. But few believe him because he has done nothing to cancel Resolution 1. Stepping down would also mean abandoning the vast wealth he and his faction in Zanu-PF have accumulated over the years, largely through graft.\n\nThis is perhaps the key grievance of his enemies. In a broadcast from a hidden location on Wednesday, Geza listed alleged Mnangagwa business cronies who he said had grown fat on corrupt government contracts.\n\nBut how Mnangagwa would remain in office constitutionally is unclear. An anonymous senior opposition leader, also one of the constitutions architects, told ISS Today that three safeguards in the constitution prevented anyone from seeking a third term. These include that: no one should serve more than two terms; constitutional amendments require approval by a national referendum; and no incumbent can benefit from a constitutional amendment.\n\nSo, the legal obstacles to Mnangagwa seeking a third term were considerable, he said. As are the political obstacles  and especially that the necessary referendum would probably turn into a referendum on Mnangagwas rule. Considering the broad unhappiness with him, that would be a hard vote to win.\n\nThe opposition leader thought Mnangagwas strategy would simply be to extend his term and those of current parliamentarians. This would still require amending the constitution, but he suspected Mnangagwas faction believed they could pass an amendment without a referendum.\n\nIts hard to assess how serious these rumblings are, if there will be a 31 March uprising, and whether that might unseat Mnangagwa.\n\nPolitical loyalties\n\nIt was the military, then headed by Chiwenga, that removed Mugabe in 2017, so speculation about its political loyalties is rife.\n\nDaily Maverick recently quoted unnamed military sources saying Chiwenga still commanded considerable support in the Zimbabwe Defence Forces. However, Mnangagwa retains the allegiance of Defence Force Chief General Philip Valerio Sibanda.\n\nIbbo Mandaza, the director of Zimbabwes Sapes Trust, told ISS Today: I dont know whether its a coup in the making, but all indications are that the centre can no longer hold.\n\nBrian Raftopoulos, a Zimbabwe and democracy expert at the University of Cape Towns Nelson Mandela School of Public Governance, believes there is real danger of an upheaval.\n\nHe says Chiwengas resentment about Mnangagwas broken promise to step down in 2028 is creating divisions in Zanu-PF, the military and the security establishment. But he doesnt foresee the kind of massive support on the streets they had in 2017.\n\nDavid Moore, retired professor of development studies at the University of Johannesburg, agreed, saying: I would be surprised if a lot of people participated.\n\nHe doubted that the main opposition party  the greatly weakened Citizens Coalition for Change  would join in, as that would show they had given up on rallying the masses, choosing instead to ally with a faction of the ruling party and the military, thus perhaps verifying what some observers already think.\n\nRaftopoulos added that civil society was also weak. He said that even if there were violent protests within Zanu-PF, Mnangagwa is going to keep this under control. For example, he noted how Mnangagwa shifted Zimbabwe National Army Lieutenant-General Anselem Sanyatwe (believed to be a Chiwenga supporter) to Minister of Sport, Recreation and Culture  perceived as a huge demotion.\n\nAnd, he will continue to move people he feels that he cant trust. The long run for him is either to contain Chiwenga as much as possible, or push him out and isolate him.\n\nThere would be disturbances and unrest, maybe even an attempt to oust Mnangagwa. But whether it will be a full-blown coup attempt, I have my doubts.\n\nProtests\n\nAnd Raftopoulos believes regional and global politics will be on Mnangagwas side if he does crack down on protests.\n\nThe global rise of the right has given traction to authoritarians like Mnangagwa. He can now say to the West, especially the Trump administration, who are you to talk to us about democracy?\n\nHe said Zimbabwe was no longer on the European Unions watch list either, So (Mnangagwa) wont have to worry about any kind of blowback from the North, if he gets violent.\n\nAnd the Southern African Development Community (SADC)  which Mnangagwa now chairs  is too preoccupied with other issues like the Democratic Republic of the Congo to do anything, according to Raftopoulos.\n\nMnangagwa might also have in mind that neither the SADC nor the African Union took action after the November 2017 overthrow, even though their rules stipulate that member states be suspended after a coup.\n\nOne does not wish a military coup on Zimbabwe, especially if it just replaces one rapacious Zanu-PF faction with another. But neither does one wish to see Mnangagwa smash any protests while an indifferent world looks on. The region should intervene. DM\n\n",

The reckless call for an illegal uprising and incitement to violence is totally unZimbabwean and must be rejected by every peace-loving citizen.\n\nAt the centre of this chaos is an individual who no longer deserves the respected title of Cde but a chap called Blessed Geza, a useless, failed politician and fugitive from justice, whose only remaining strategy is to provoke instability from his self-imposed exile.\n\nExpelled from Zanu PF for his dishonourable conduct, Geza has become a political nonentity, desperately trying to stay relevant by leading a criminal cartel of fugitives and bitter opposition remnants, said Chivayo in a social media post.\n\nChivayo has become a target of Gezas threats, accused of directly benefitting from corruption through government contracts.\n\nLast year, Chivayo was embroiled in controversy after it emerged that he fronted a company awarded a US$100 million tender by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) to supply materials for the 2023 general elections.\n\nHe was also on a list of individualsincluding Kudakwashe Tagwirei warned by Geza. In a suspicious move, cars were torched Thursday night at the premises of the two business tycoons.\n\nChivayo said the March 31 protests equate to terrorism against the government.\n\nTo shift from legal and peaceful demonstrations and start burning vehicles, destroying property belonging to innocent individuals, and calling for the violent removal of a government is illegal, treasonous, and easily qualifies as terrorism.\n\nNo serious, patriotic Zimbabwean should entertain this. I urge all citizens to ignore the empty call to protest tomorrow or on any other day called for by anarchists such as Geza. Let us all continue normally with our lives tomorrow and beyond, said Chivayo.\n\nThe call to protest against Mnangagwa has laid bare the factional battles simmering within the ruling party.\n\nAt Thursdays Zanu PF Central Committee meeting, Mnangagwa read the riot act, warning party members backing Geza.\n\nChivayo further stated that those harbouring leadership ambitions should wait for Mnangagwa to step down after his term expires in 2028.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa still has three full years remaining in his term, and he has publicly pledged to step down at the end of itas a true constitutionalist. If anyone has ambitions, they must respect party processes and wait for the next congress.\n\nWhen that time comes, I personally will support whoever has been democratically elected, with every prayer and every cent I have saved, to ensure we keep Zanu PF as the ruling party forever and ever, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "The Mirror\n\nSinger Linda Mudzenda stopped theBritains Got Talentjudges in their tracks with an emotional performance that earned her the shows seventh golden buzzer.\n\nZimbabwe-born Linda blew everyone away as she belted out You Say by Lauren Daigle. JudgeAlesha Dixon who frequently hit the Top 10 in the noughties with girl group Mis-Teeq  was so moved she sent Linda straight into the finals. The 21-year-old childrens support worker dedicated the performance to mum Susan, saying she wants to win so she can give her a better life. She said: The reason Im here, working so hard, is because of my mum.\n\nShe sacrificed a lot for me to live my passion of music. So shes the first person Id thank with the prize money. A lot would go to making sure she can relax for the rest of her life.\n\nLinda grew up in Harare, Zimbabwe, with five siblings  and says life was tough as her mum raised them single-handed. She said: It was hard, but my mum managed to take care of us and do everything. I cant say it was good, but we got through it.\n\nSo being on the stage, it was a relief for me. It was a joy I didnt have for the past two months. I almost got depressed, but managed to conquer it. Thats why it was emotional for me.\n\nLinda with mum Susan, who says she wants to win BGT for her mum\n\nSince then, she says, things are on the up. Now everythings OK at work, I managed to find a place to stay and my health is a bit better.\n\nI was diagnosed with the pre-diabetic condition. Im on a diet. I have a cyst on my left side  Im still yet to see if they can do an operation. So Im in a good space. BGT came at the right time.\n\nAnd she says judge Alesha had some touching words of advice for her. Linda revealed: Alesha did come on the stage after hitting the buzzer. She did tell me that I deserved it. I deserved to be part of the show, and it was all worth it for me to be there.\n\nLinda admits that she has had her sights set on appearing on theITVtalent show since childhood. She said: I watched BGT onYouTubeall the time growing up. When people used to ask me what I dream of doing when I grow up, I used to say to be part of Britains Got Talent. Despite being all the way in Zimbabwe, I always believed Id move to the UK and make it happen.\n\nLindas first memory of singing was alongside her sisters in church at the age of 10. At 16 she started collaborating professionally with Gospel artists around theworld. She also writes her own music and will release her first single this autumn.\n\nShe said: Winning BGT and getting recognised internationally would be a huge dream come true. It would allow me to grow my audience, release more songs and potentially tour with my own sound, she said.\n\nLinda joins other golden buzzers Vinnie McKee (Simon Cowell), Will Burns (Ant and Dec), Stacey Leadbeatter (KSI), Olly Pearson (Amanda Holden), and the group The Blackouts.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/why-british-boarding-schools-are-so-eager-to-open-in-nigeria/",
            "content": "By BBC\n\nFOR many years, well-off Nigerians have sent their children to prestigious British boarding schools  but now some of those institutions are setting up campuses in Africas most populous nation.\n\nLast year, Charterhouse launched a primary school in the city of Lagos and will open a secondary school this September.\n\nRugby School will also begin offering secondary education in September. Other well-known institutions, such as Millfield, Wellington School and Harrow, are also exploring opportunities in Nigeria.\n\nThis obviously all comes with a price tag for Nigerian parents  but the countrys well-heeled elite have historically sent their children to the UK for secondary education, drawn to the British curriculums rigour, prestige and global opportunities.\n\nIm actually excited about it, says Karima Oyede, a British-Nigerian management consultant, whose son is currently in year 10 at Rugby in the UK but will be moving to its Lagos school in September.\n\nHer family has been meaning to relocate to Nigeria for a while but has not done so earlier because of the childrens education.\n\nHaving the opportunity to experience the British system in his country of origin is the best of both worlds, she says.\n\nNigeria already has a proliferation of private schools but high-quality, internationally recognised education within the country will appeal to many parents, particularly those who wish to preserve their childrens cultural identity.\n\nAfrican parents love the fact that they are giving their children international standing so they can compete with their counterparts in any other part of the world, but they dont want their children to lose their African-ness, says Ijay Uwakwe-Okoronkwo, the founder of Nkuzhi Learning Foundation in Nigerias capital, Abuja.\n\nThe educational consultant, who advises parents and schools on international boarding options, explains the more relaxed, less respectful attitude children return with after going to school abroad is not always appreciated.\n\nThis cultural dilemma extends to the growing conversation around LGBTQ issues. Same-sex relationships and public displays of affection are illegal in Nigeria and homosexuality is not openly discussed or promoted.\n\nIt is something that the new crop of British schools has taken on board. For example, while Charterhouse UK displays a rainbow flag, the Nigeria school does not.\n\nWere a British independent school but sitting firmly within Nigerian cultural needs, says John Todd, head of Charterhouse Nigeria.\n\nTheres this huge concern about Western cultural views. For parents here, we know its a really big issue. Its a reason parents are worried about the UK schools.\n\nIm not making a judgement  its just the way it is.\n\nBritish institutions in Nigeria have no choice but to follow the law of the land, he acknowledges, adding: We are 100% compliant.\n\nRecognising Nigerias deeply religious society, Charterhouse also permits parents to take their children home from the boarding house for Sunday church services, with the expectation that they return by Monday morning.\n\nThere are several reasons behind the growing interest of prestigious British schools in opening campuses in Nigeria.\n\nWhile regions like the Middle East and China are already saturated with international schools, Africa is relatively virgin territory.\n\nNigeria is the gateway to Africa, and Africa is kind of the last continent for British schools to establish in, says Mark Brooks, an export champion for the UKs Department for Business and Trade.\n\nHe organises annual events in Nigeria where about 20 British schools meet prospective students and parents.\n\nNigeria has an incredible reputation for producing driven, high-achieving students, says Mr Brooks.\n\nThere is no school I work with that hasnt recently had a Nigerian student serve as head boy or deputy head boy. A student may join the sixth form and end up being the head boy within a year.\n\nIve brought hundreds of head teachers to Nigeria over the years, and the word is out in the UK that we need to take Nigeria seriously.\n\nTiming has also proved key, as the cost of sending children to the UK has soared. Just three years ago, the exchange rate of the local currency was 500 naira to 1; now it stands at 2,200 naira.\n\nOn top of that, the Labour government in the UK recently imposed 20% VAT on private school fees.\n\nBeyond tuition, families face additional expenses like flights for both students and visiting parents.\n\nEstablishing these schools in Nigeria allows families to maintain the same standard of education while significantly reducing the financial strain.\n\nThe annual fees at Charterhouse UK, for example, are around 60,000 ($78,000), whereas the fees at its Lagos campus are equivalent to approximately 15,000.\n\nOur main classroom teachers are expatriates, but 90% of the staff are local, says Mr Todd.\n\nBy employing local people in roles such as assistant teachers, administration, finance, human resources, marketing, facilities, security, gardeners, drivers, PAs and secretaries, the school can significantly reduce costs compared to the UK, where labour is much more expensive.\n\nA vast education gap already exists in Nigeria, with many parents opting for private education of varying quality. Many struggle to pay the higher fees rather than sending their children to government schools, which are often free but plagued by poorly trained teachers and frequent strikes.\n\nAs a result, the arrival of British schools may not drastically change Nigerias education system.\n\nHowever, they could pose a threat to established elite schools like the British International School in Lagos and The Regent School in Abuja, which opened in the early 2000s.\n\nSuch schools have long been top choices for those able to pay the annual tuition fees that often reach tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nRugby School Nigeria is coming also to support, develop and learn from the schools currently in Nigeria, says Mr Brooks, who is in charge of the schools marketing.\n\nWe are coming to help with partnerships as well, teacher training, and a whole range of initiatives.\n\nSince January, private school fees in the UK are no longer exempt from VAT\n\nMr Todd believes the Nigerian market is large enough to accommodate all the new schools without threatening existing ones. About 40% of the 200 million population is under 14.\n\nHe expects the greatest impact to be felt in the UK.\n\nWhile Charterhouse UK typically has a long waiting list and should not be affected, less sought-after boarding schools may experience a decline in enrolment owing to the new competition in Nigeria.\n\nInterest in our secondary school is very strong, says Mr Todd. We already have Nigerian parents in the UK sending their children to the Charterhouse in Nigeria for September.\n\nIn fact, reaching out to Nigerians in the UK has been one of their key marketing strategies.\n\nYou get this premier brand at a lower price, and every Nigerian has an aunt or uncle in Lagos who can be a guardian, he adds.\n\nIt could be that this trend extends to British universities. Nigerias tertiary education system faces even greater challenges than its secondary sector, with many students opting to study abroad.\n\nIn 2023, Nigeria ranked among the top 10 countries for UK student visas, according to UK government data.\n\nBut with foreign exchange difficulties and stricter visa regulations, studying abroad is becoming increasingly challenging  and universities that rely on higher international tuition fees appear to be suffering.\n\nEarlier this month, British MP Helen Hayes, chair of the parliamentary Education Committee, acknowledged the UKs higher education sector was in trouble.\n\nDozens of universities are making redundancies and cuts to courses, trying to stay afloat amid uncertainty over where their money is coming from, she said when announcing a session to consider the sectors future.\n\nIf enough Nigerian students can no longer go to the UK to study, British universities may find it profitable to come to them, as they have elsewhere in the world.\n\nIn fact, Nigerias premier university, the University of Ibadan, was established in 1948 as a campus of the University of London, with degrees awarded carrying the same value and prestige.\n\nMs Uwakwe-Okoronkwo believes many Nigerian parents would appreciate this opportunity, as it would allow their children to stay in Nigeria long enough to mature before potentially moving abroad, if they choose to do so.\n\nMany parents are worried about sending their children out of the nest too early, she says.\n\nFor Ms Oyede, whose daughter will also be starting at Rugby School in Lagos come September, the timing of all this could not be better.\n\nShe says the British school opening has already been an incentive to return home.\n\nThe prospect of university opportunities would be a welcome bonus.\n\nAdaobi Tricia Nwaubani is a freelance Nigerian journalist and novelist based in Abuja and London.\n\n",

            "content": "By IOL\n\nMUSIC legend and internationally acclaimed South African composer and songwriter Jonathan Butler was recently awarded an honorary doctorate by Stellenbosch University (SU) for his significant contributions to the arts and culture, particularly in his role as a composer, songwriter, and performer.\n\nHe was also recognised for his dedication to creating platforms that ensure access to the arts for young people from marginalised communities.\n\nSpeaking about the momentous occasion, Butler shared the emotional weight he felt as he walked up to the podium to receive his degree.\n\nWalking up to the podium was very overwhelming, he said.\n\nThe thought of this happening to me as a little boy never occurred to me at all. Seeing my family there made it even more emotional, especially considering our experience growing up.\n\nWhat we didnt have in education, we definitely had in music. I felt so incredibly proud. The weight of it all was truly amazing.\n\nButler also reflected on his ongoing work and passion for music, stating that retirement is not a concept he entertains.\n\nRetirement, whats that? To a musician, theres no such thing, he said.\n\nIm always working on new music, and I love giving back to young musicians through masterclasses.\n\nIm also involved with Lelela Charitable Non-Profit, supporting over 5,000 children in Cape Town through the arts and education. Theres no retirement in my world.\n\nOn his ongoing collaboration with other artists, Butler added, Ive written for numerous artists over the years, and collaboration has always been key to my growth as a songwriter. Its about sharing ideas and creating something beautiful together.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Butler shared, This moment is a dream fulfilled, one that has come through beyond anything I could ever ask, think or imagine. It is a glorious day, one that I will carry in me for the rest of my life.\n\nI stand before you deeply humbled. I am filled with gratitude and joy.\n\nReflecting on his upbringing in South Africa, he spoke about the hardships he faced growing up in Belgravia Estate in Athlone, Cape Town, under the shadow of Apartheid.\n\nAs one of the first artists of colour to be played on South African radio and appear on national television at a time of severe racial segregation, Butlers achievements were groundbreaking.\n\nAs the youngest of 12 children in a family that used music to make ends meet, Butler began touring at the age of seven when he joined a travelling stage show.\n\nHe was later signed to perform on a string of hit recordings, turning him into a local teen idol. His influence grew, and he later became a key voice in the international movement advocating for the release of Nelson Mandela and other political prisoners.\n\nHaving made a name for himself in Africa and the United Kingdom (UK), Butlers breakthrough in the United States came in 1987 when he toured as pop star Whitney Houstons opening act.\n\nThat same year, his Grammy-nominated hit single Lies reached #27 on Billboards Hot 100 chart and peaked at #18 on the UK Official Singles Chart.\n\nHis cover of If Youre Ready (Come Go with Me) with Ruby Turner also made waves in the UK. Over the years, he has released over 28 albums, including several gospel projects, with his track Falling In Love with Jesus being one of his most beloved songs.\n\nDespite his international acclaim, Butler has remained grounded and true to his roots. He is the first Global Entertainment Ambassador for the Lalela Foundation, which provides arts education for at-risk youth in South Africa. Through its arts curriculum and messaging, Lalela directly serves more than 5,000 South African learners per week.\n\nButler continues to make music across multiple genres and tours the world. His latest album, Ubuntu, features a collaboration with iconic artist Stevie Wonder on a cover version of Wonders song Superwoman.\n\nReflecting on his deep connection to South Africa, he expressed his ongoing commitment to young musicians in Cape Town through the non-profit Arts Capital. My heart always longs for my home, he shared. I come back every year to work with young musicians and share stories with them.\n\nTo aspiring musicians, Butler offered a message of hope and determination: To the young Jonathan Butlers out there, look up at the sky and believe that one day, youll take flight into your future. Practice, practice, practice, and always remember where you come from.\n\nAs he proudly accepted the honorary doctorate, Butler concluded, Its a proud moment for me, for my family, and for the community I come from.\n\n",
