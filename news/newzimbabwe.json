Not only because I was used to her presence, but I love my children John and Minana INCREDIBLY. However, our marriage faced IRRECONCILABLE differences that made it impossible to continue. She struggled to get along with my family, including my DEAR late mother and all my 6 sisters, and the constant fighting became too overwhelming for me. It reached a point where I felt that the person I was fighting for was not making an effort to support me when the world had turned its back on me. This made the marriage IRRETRIEVABLY broken down. Despite these challenges, she remains a GREAT mother and a good person, and I continue to look after her exceptionally well and respect her as such.\n\nWe now co-parent very well and I ensure that my children are well taken care of. Women are good at playing the victim and will never publicly acknowledge a mans efforts. For instance, I recently paid TWO MILLION rand for their Christmas holiday, where they travelled to Vietnam and Japan and on top of that, I gave her an additional ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS USD cash for their shopping and for her to share with her family, reads part of his post.\n\nSonja took no time to respond, lashing out at her ex-husband for always making noise on the internet adding that they had not seen each other in 7 months.\n\nIn a series of Instagram stories, she said, I dont care who you marry. Marry and move on\n\nRespect your business partners, respect the offices you go in. Why are you always making noise on the internet? Arent you supposed to at church? Arent you supposed to be at kuMasowe?\n\n",

            "content": "By James Muonwa l Mashonaland West Correspondent\n\nTHE countrys infrastructural landscape is fast transforming itself with the emergence of multi-storey shopping malls mushrooming in all major towns and cities.\n\nAccommodating all sorts of entrepreneurs, grocers, liquor, perfumery and clothing retailers, and electrical appliances traders, among a host of other merchandise, the precincts are densely populated with every inch of space being fully utilised to display wares.\n\nWhilst business owners are flocking to these ambient and conveniently-located malls, they are oblivious to risks of fire associated with the cramped joints while the unregulated use of gas tanks, kettles, jugs and stoves by employees heightens chances of infernos breaking out. In some instances, blazes are triggered by appliances left unattended.\n\nIn recent months, Mashonaland West towns of Chinhoyi and Kadoma have recorded cases of fire outbreaks at business premises resulting in massive loss of property and sources of livelihood particularly for micro-small and medium entrepreneurs (MSMEs).\n\nEarlier in 2024, a complex belonging to an Indian property mogul suspiciously caught fire in Chinhoyi and reduced his tenants electrical appliances and furniture stock to ashes.\n\nMid October, an inferno broke out in central Kadoma and engulfed a local shop opposite Comoil fuel station leaving a devastating trail of destruction resulting in significant business loss.\n\nMore recently, an entire shopping complex situated at Mzimba shopping centre, Coldstream suburb, Chinhoyi, went up in flames and consumed merchandise worth thousands of dollars. The affected units included clothing boutiques, electrical appliances sales, hardware, hair salons, barber shops, canteen, and grocery shops, among others.\n\nMany of the affected business owners were left without anywhere to start after having lost everything in the blaze, thereby raising the need for MSMEs to seriously consider insuring their premises and stock against fire risks.\n\nFire insurance covers damage to property including the roof, walls, and foundation and contents such as furniture and appliances.\n\nInsurance and Pensions Commission (IPEC) public relations manager, Lloyd Gumbo told NewZimbabwe.com MSMEs must take steps to insure premises and merchandise against eventualities such as fires which are now prevalent.\n\nIndeed, cases of fire outbreaks have become prevalent and the commission encourages Micro, Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (MSMEs) to insure their premises and merchandise against the various risks that they face such as fire, flood, theft, or vandalism.\n\nHaving insurance against these risks helps MSMEs to reduce the potential losses and improve their resilience, said Gumbo.\n\nQuizzed on what policy interventions IPEC is pushing for to ensure short-term insurance for the risk of fire and resultant losses thereof are taken up by entrepreneurs, Gumbo hinted a lot is being done.\n\nIn line with the National Financial Inclusion Strategy, IPEC is spearheading insurance inclusion through various initiatives including, the registration of dedicated microinsurance companies, approving microinsurance products, and financial literacy.\n\nIn terms of financial literacy, the commission is collaborating with the Ministry of Women Affairs, Community, and Small and Medium Enterprise Development and the Insurance Council of Zimbabwe (ICZ) in educating ministry officers on the importance of insurance.\n\nThis year, the commission has in collaboration with ICZ trained the Ministrys Provincial and District Business Development Officers on insurance so that they can also train MSMEs in their respective areas, Gumbo told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nZimbabwe National Organisation of Associations and Residents Trusts (ZNOART) Mashonaland West provincial chairman, Liberty Chitiya said there is a need for strict regulation of the use of premises which should be insured.\n\nWe need authorities to intensify awareness campaigns and for them to be devolved into different sectors of the economy especially the SMEs and household level where fire fighting techniques and equipment are minimum.\n\nThere has been a lack of knowledge on the causes of fire, largely because our buildings are now being used by many different occupiers more than the stipulated number. The local authorities have failed to rein in proper building by-laws resulting in fire accidents.\n\nThe element of insurance is also welcome so that resultant losses by entrepreneurs are absorbed and the livelihoods safeguarded. However, insurance companies need to also tap into the SMEs industry through introducing tailor-made insurance packages given the rising business building occupancies in many CBDs, said Chitiya.\n\nTo demonstrate the huge appetite for this type of insurance, fire premiums are one of the major contributors to foreign currency-denominated insurance revenue.\n\nAccording to the IPEC 2024 first quarter report, the main sources of foreign-currency-denominated insurance revenue for short-term insurers were motor, fire, hail and personal accident contributing a combined 79% of the total insurance revenue.\n\nShort-term insurers reported foreign currency-denominated insurance revenue amounting to US$ 53.18 million for the first quarter ended March 31, 2024.\n\nThe architecture of the short-term insurance industry recorded positive development amid the registration of new players. There were 1,262 registered entities/persons in the short-term insurance industry as of March 31, 2024 as compared to 1,198 the previous year under review. This represented a 5% jump.\n\nShort-term insurers reported insurance revenue amounting to ZW$812.96 billion for the period under review. Nineteen (19) out of twenty (20) short-term insurers reported capitalcapitalisation positions above the minimum capital requirement of ZW$37.5 million during the reporting period.\n\nThe market leaders in terms of consolidated insurance revenue wereZimnat Lion, Nicoz Diamond, Old Mutual Insurance, Alliance Insurance and Cell Insurance with a combined market share of 71%.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZimbabwean economist Eddie Cross has expressed concern over how natural resources worth billions of dollars are being looted to China yet there is no real investment that benefits locals.\n\nIn a blog titled What is the Chinese Motivation in Zimbabwe, Cross said he had learnt that Zimbabwe now accommodates 85,000 Chinese nationals accusing them of exploiting Zimbabweans and their resources.\n\nAlthough the Chinese have invested millions into Zimbabwe, incidences of abuse on locals by some of them and exploitation continue to mar their partnership and development efforts.\n\nCross also expressed concern about how the Chinese are leaving behind a trail of environmental destruction which will take generations to heal.\n\nWe have the best Chrome deposits in the world, 9 billion tonnes of it worth a conservative US$100 trillion. We have enormous Lithium reserves and they are loaded with other critical minerals that are in fact worth more than the Lithium and we do not understand what that means.\n\nWe applaud them because shortly we will be exporting 5 million tonnes of lithium concentrate a year to China, worth perhaps US$4 billion in new export earnings, four times our famous tobacco crop, but missing the fact that it might contain other metals and minerals worth many times more.\n\nA quarter of our gold output goes to China and we have no idea about how they are doing that or what is involved, but the evidence of open cast mining, large investments in milling and extracting machinery for the small-scale mining industry here which is among the most important in the world, is everywhere.\n\nThey ignore environmental regulations and leave behind a moonscape of countryside that looks like a World War 1 battlefield.They are exploiting our finest coal reserves for their smelters and steel production, even exporting their surplus, he wrote.\n\nSeveral Chinese-owned companies are accused of destroying communities as the scramble for lithium and other valuable minerals intensifies in Zimbabwe.\n\nThey are alleged to be violating environmental laws, with government officials criticised for turning a blind eye to their operations.\n\nAreas such as the once scenic Boterekwa in the Shurugwi district, which is facing significant environmental damage due to mining operations being undertaken by a Chinese company.\n\nCross also highlighted that the Chinese also focus on infrastructure development that benefits them in their large-scale investments so theyachieve their goals.\n\nThere is little or no value addition except for the primary production phase. There are no plans to invest in a Lithium refinery to produce a product suitable for use in the production of batteries. Even the steel plant is only producing steel billets for export to China for conversion into finished product. International sanctions may force them to produce steel for sale to manufacturers in the West but for the time being they are producing a product for export in primary form.\n\nRight now, the decision by the Zimbabwe Government not to maintain power subsidies on electricity going to their furnaces is forcing the Chinese companies to invest in coal-based power production.\n\nThey are doing so at a cost of US$600,000 per megawatt with the objective of meeting their own needs at about US$6 cents per Kilowatt, one-third of the current ZESA tariff which is necessary because the new Chinese built power station at Hange cost three times per Megawatt than what their own plant will cost. To achieve those sorts of outcomes they will have to secure coal at rock-bottom prices, while they supply ZESA at three times the cost.\n\nThis is a very concerning situation and the question for us as a nation, is what do we do about it.\n\n",

Both first innings scores were national records.\n\nWith Zimbabwe 88-4 in their second innings and 25 runs behind, batting stability was required and the unbeaten partnership of veterans Sean Williams (35) and Craig Ervine (22) provided it.\n\nShahidi departed after being trapped leg before by Bennett, whose 5-95 were the best figures among the six-man Zimbabwe attack.\n\nThe 30-year-old left-hand batter faced 474 balls in 694 minutes, and struck 21 fours at Queens Sports Club in the southwestern city.\n\nHis partnerships with Rahmat Shah (364 runs) and Afsar Zazai (211) ensured Afghanistan took a 113-run first innings lead.\n\nThe previous highest Test score of Shahidi was 200 not out, also against Zimbabwe, in Abu Dhabi three years ago.\n\nBefore the exit of Shahidi, wicketkeeper Zazai claimed a maiden Test century, hitting 113 before being caught at backward point by substitute Johnathan Campbell.\n\nThe fall of Shahidi triggered a collapse with the final six Afghanistan wickets going for just 20 runs in four overs as the off spin of Bennett wreaked havoc.\n\nBennett, a 21-year-old appearing in only his second Test, twice took wickets from successive balls only to be deprived of hat-tricks on both occasions.\n\nHe also shone with the bat, making 110 not out in the first innings after Zimbabwe captain Ervine won the toss.\n\nBatting a second time, Zimbabwe put on 73 runs before an outside edge from Joylord Gumbie (24) allowed Shahidi to make a simple catch in the slips.\n\nThe fall of the wicket was followed almost immediately by mid-afternoon rain that led to a one hour delay.\n\nTest debutant Ben Curran, a son of deceased former Zimbabwe coach Kevin Curran and brother of England internationals Tom and Sam, made 41 before being run out.\n\nGumbie, Curran and Takudzwanashe Kaitano (5) fell in the space of 14 balls, with spinner Zahir Khan taking two wickets, and Dion Myers(4) was bowled by teenage spinner Allah Ghazanfar.\n\nBrief scores\n\nZimbabwe 586 in 135.2 overs and 142-4 in 34 overs (Ben Curran 41, Sean Williams 35 not out, Craig Ervine 22 not out; Zahir Khan 2-43) v Afghanistan 699 in 197 overs (Hashmatullah Shahidi 246, Rahmat Shah 234, Afsar Zazai 113; Brian Bennett 5-95)\n\nResult: Match drawn\n\nToss: Zimbabwe\n\n",
