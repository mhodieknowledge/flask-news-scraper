            "content": "Brisbane Times\n\nA disability care director has left Australia despite claims his company owes more than A$6.4 million (US$4.2 million) to the tax office, employees and other creditors, while facing allegations from a liquidator of insolvent trading and funnelling money into offshore property and luxury assets.\n\nA preliminary liquidator report from last month, which is subject to further investigations, alleges Adachi Disability Services directors Adrian Tafari Mtungwazi, 53, and wife Chiedza Mtungwazi, 45, misused company funds, drawing more than A$2 million in director loans, buying a Ferrari, and a shopping centre and football club in Zimbabwe.\n\nAdrian Mtungwazi is being sought by the Australian Taxation Office for A$3 million in tax.\n\nIn the report, Pitcher Partners liquidator Andrew Yeo told creditors Mr Mtungwazi left Australia in May citing family reasons, and has not communicated directly with liquidators since.\n\nHis wife remains in Perth, with a Pitcher Partners spokesperson confirming she was cooperating fully with the ongoing investigation.\n\nIf the claims of insolvent trading are prosecuted and proven, the directors face hefty fines and potentially criminal charges that carry up to five years jail time. No charges have been laid to date.\n\nAccording to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, directors are not prevented from leaving Australia while their company is in liquidation, as long as they continue cooperating with investigators.\n\nAdrian Mtungwazi left Australia after his business became insolvent.\n\nAn Australian Taxation Office spokesperson said in certain cases, directors could be issued an order preventing them leaving the country if they had significant debts, but would not confirm whether such an order was placed on Mr Mtungwazi.\n\nWhere specific circumstances are met, such as where there is a high risk of non-payment and alternate recovery options are limited, we may issue (these orders) to ensure taxpayers do not leave Australia without paying or making appropriate arrangements to pay outstanding debts, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe ATO is unable to comment [on Mr Mtungwazi] due to taxpayer confidentiality laws, and it would not be appropriate to comment on matters before the courts.\n\nAdachi was recognised by the Zimbabwe Association of WA.Credit:Linkedin\n\nSeparately, earlier this month, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation escalated matters by personally suing Mr Mtungwazi, filing a writ with the WA Supreme Court seeking to recover what it claimed was more than A$3 million in Adachis unpaid tax and superannuation debts.\n\nAttempts by this masthead to contact Mr Mtungwazi for comment has not been successful.\n\nMs Mtungwazi has not provided a response for publication.\n\nThe couple established Adachi Disability Services in Perth in 2019 as a registered provider under the National Disability Insurance Scheme.\n\nThe organisation offered daily living assistance and services and, at its peak, employed about 300 staff, supporting 40 clients and operating from offices in Cannington, Gosnells and Maddington.\n\nIn 2021, Mr Mtungwazi was recognised by the Zimbabwe Association of WA with an Innovation and Entrepreneurship Award. On LinkedIn, a peer described him as an inspiration to many migrants  a proven visionary.\n\nWhile Adachi was unravelling, Mr Mtungwazi was projecting wealth. A video posted to social media two years ago shows Mr Mtungwazi standing in front of five sports cars, boasting about how many he owns.\n\nThese cars are worth a million dollars US, he tells the person filming.\n\nIve got another 40 cars  theres five here. But its hard work. You got to live life. You gotta do what you gotta do.\n\nBehind the rapid expansion and image of success, Yeos liquidation report claimed Adachi was drowning in debt and mismanagement.\n\nThe report said the company began facing regulatory issues in 2021, including audits and compliance concerns related to the mismanagement of client complaints.\n\nYeo said it was in his opinion that by August 2022, the company was insolvent, at which time it already owed about $4 million to the tax office, and it appeared to continue to accumulate millions in further debt.\n\nIn February 2024, the NDIS banned Adachi from providing care.\n\nAdachi won an award in 2024 despite owing millions in debt.\n\nBut a month later, the company was named Best Family-Run Care & Disability Services Company in Western Australia in the Asia Pacific Accreditation Cooperations Australian Enterprise awards.\n\nAPAC is an international organisation that helps countries in the Asia-Pacific trust each others certificates, so businesses dont have to repeat tests in other countries.\n\nYeo also alleged in his report the directors established new ventures under different names, including New Seasons Health Care Services and Daily Living Disability Services in Traralgon, Victoria  both in April, 2024  in what he described as an attempt to keep new businesses separated from the company.\n\nThe liquidator report states the directors had agreed to a payment plan with the ATO in 2023, but made only four instalments, before the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation issued a legal demand in November 2024.\n\nBy the time Adachi was wound up in May 2025, the company owed more than $6.4 million, with the bulk of claims to the ATO, but also to staff, Revenue WA, QBE Insurance and Optus, the liquidator report noted.\n\nMore than 80 employees were owed about $450,000 in unpaid wages and superannuation.\n\nThe liquidators report detailed how Adachi allegedly used a web of related companies to shuffle money and assets.\n\nYeo said at the time of his appointment in May, Adachi Disability Services was owed more than $8.6 million by associated entities, including A$6 million owed by Adachi Assets Pty Ltd.\n\nEffectively all assets utilised by the company in the conduct of its business were actually owned by Adachi Assets, even though the purchase of any assets were funded by income generated by the company, Yeo wrote.\n\nAmong these were numerous vehicles and properties, including a Ferrari, which Yeo said was purchased purely for the directors personal use.\n\nOn top of this, director loans to Adrian and Chiedza Mtungwazi totalled more than A$2.3 million, according to the report.\n\nMs Mtungwazi said these should be seen as salary substitutes, but Yeo said he strongly disagreed with that reasoning.\n\nYeo also found $335,000 was transferred to South Africa, the UK, Philippines and Zimbabwe, between 2022-24.\n\nHe said Adachis money was even used to establish a Zimbabwean football club, Adachi FC, and to purchase property in Bulawayo, including the Morningside Shops for A$1.3 million. Bulawayo is listed as the birthplace for the directors on their ASIC record.\n\nA liquidator has the ability to investigate potential offences that may have been committed by directors and submit a report to ASIC.\n\nIf the liquidator alleges there have been breaches, ASIC can investigate and lay civil charges, or refer the case to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, if criminal charges are warranted.\n\n",

After initially settling in Auckland with their two children, the family moved south to Central Otago.\n\nMr Kamota took on the role of financial director at Central Otago Health Services Ltd and now serves as financial manager for Dunedin Kindergartens, splitting his time between Central Otago and Dunedin.\n\nDespite a thriving career in finance, his passion for farming remains strong.\n\nOutside of work, I have a passion for farming.\n\nI have Boer goats, and the plan is to get a farm and continue to grow and increase the herd for export, he said.\n\nTo help turn this vision into a viable business, Mr Kamota applied for a mentor through the Newcomers Business Mentorship Programme.\n\nHis goal was clear: To build confidence in business in a developed structure, with someone who can help me network, give me practical advice and provide a safe space to share mistakes and understand the context of New Zealand.\n\nThe programme, a collaboration between Business Mentors NZ, Business South and Central Otagos Welcoming Communities initiative, has paired Mr Kamota with a mentor for a year-long journey.\n\nOrganisers say they are thrilled to support his agricultural ambitions.\n\nWere excited to see where Mr Kamota takes his farming venture and look forward to following his progress, a spokesperson said.
