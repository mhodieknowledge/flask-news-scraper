Where is the dignity? Surely, you must all resign. This level of incompetence borders on the criminal. Its a mess. We need new leaders.\n\nMahere continued her broadside in another post on X Sunday, February 16, 2025: They promised us affordable, quality healthcare. Instead, they have given us cardboard boxes to use as casts to treat fractures, no clean water in public hospitals, torn hospital beds and no medication. Its a mess.\n\nSelf-exiled Zanu PF loyalist Kudzai Mutisi, based in South Africa, also weighed in, lambasting his own partys ministers as useless, unable to deliver even the most basic services to the people.\n\nA Cabinet Minister is witnessing FIRST HAND how his colleague in the Ministry of Health and Child Care has FAILED to do simple things. Felix Mhona will leave the hospital and SAY NOTHING about a dysfunctional system he witnessed.\n\nIn fact, he might join the 2030ists asking for more time to play. If you cant do it now, then you certainly wont do it even if given 40 more years. The current team of ministers lacks urgency and has misplaced priorities, said Mutisi in his X post on Sunday.\n\nA Cabinet Minister is witnessing FIRST HAND how his colleague in the@MoHCCZimhas FAILED to do simple things.@MhonaFelixwill leave the hospital & SAY NOTHING about dysfunctional system he witnessed.

While these sources have a combined generation capacity of 2,570 megawatts (MW), they are producing only 1,079 MW, leaving the country with a staggering deficit of 1,560 MW.\n\nTo bridge this gap, the national utility has been forced to import electricity from neighbouring countries.\n\nThe portfolio committee warned that the situation could deteriorate further if medium and long-term solutions are not implemented urgently.\n\nHowever, in as much as the transmission and distribution lines are functioning well, ZESA management highlighted that Zimbabwe is still facing serious power outages because the distribution supply of electricity is not meeting the nations demand.\n\nThe committee noted that the major challenge is of all power plants are not producing their optimum capacity.\n\nThe committee cited that considering the state we are in as a country, if there are no strategies that are going to be implemented sooner to boost generation, the nation will be suffering for a long haul, reads the report.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) has attributed the shortfall to outdated power infrastructure, the impacts of climate change, and the theft and vandalism of power lines and substations.\n\nThe low power generation has resulted in widespread load-shedding, with residential areas experiencing power cuts lasting more than 12 hours daily.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament recently, Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) Member of Parliament, Ropafadzo Makumire, said there are far-reaching implications of the electricity crisis on key sectors of the economy, particularly healthcare.\n\nIn the health sector, you find that there are machines like ventilators which use electricity. It means that in the district hospitals where there are no dedicated lines, there will be no electricity.\n\nSo, major surgical operations cannot go ahead in this state. It means that people die because of lack of electricity and people who will be forced to walk for long distances are brought here in Harare.\n\nThis then increases the number of people being assisted. If you look at the mortuaries where these bodies are placed, you find that it is not accessible because the bodies will be in a decomposing state. This matter should be looked at with urgency so that we do not continue with this predicament, said Makumire.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nHIV patients in Epworth constituency on the outskirts of Harare are currently facing hours-long queues for life saving medical services due to severe nurse shortages following the cessation of USAID funding.\n\nFollowing U.S. President Donald Trumps America First policy, the US Embassy in Zimbabwe paused all U.S. foreign assistance funded by or through the State Department and USAID for review.\n\nThis move has led to the temporary suspension of services at New Start Centres and truck stop clinics across the country impacting patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and those seeking PrEP refills.\n\nAdditionally, USAID withdrew its nursing staff.\n\nSpeaking in a parliamentary session Wednesday, Epworth Member of Parliament, Zivanai Mhetu raised concerns over shortages of nurses, condoms, and antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) in his constituency demanding to know when the government will restore normal HIV services.\n\nMhetu said condoms and ARVs were almost running out.\n\nWhen are nurses coming and when are condoms and ARVs going to be distributed?\n\nWe were mocked in the constituencies, especially from my area, there are so many long and scary queues because (USAID) withdrew the services of their nurses.\n\nBefore the condoms and ARVs finish, we want to know when those drugs are going to be distributed, Mhetu said.\n\nSpeaker of Parliament, Jacob Mudenda said the funding gap wrought by Trumps policy shift was being looked into.\n\nlt is work in progress to close the gap resulting from the withdrawal of the funding and that will include those medical devices that the people so affected require will be addressed through that task force that has been formed by the minister, said Mudenda.\n\nApproximately 1.2 million Zimbabweans benefit from the U.S Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and over 1,600 public hospitals and clinics have received training and technical support from the U.S. government.\n\n",
