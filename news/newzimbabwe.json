            "content": "ByDr Richard Dune\n\nMost CQC failures arent caused by funding or staffing but by missing systems, poor implementation, and policies that never make it into practice\n\nBetween 2023 and 2025, nearly 200 health and social care providers in England were rated Inadequate by the Care Quality Commission (CQC). This included 47 domiciliary care agencies and 111 care homes, all of which were found to have serious, systemic weaknesses in areas such as governance, safety, safeguarding, and the overall quality of care.\n\nBut the key takeaway from these failures may surprise you. Most of them werent caused by isolated incidents, lack of funding, or staff shortages. Instead, the most common underlying issue was this:\n\nThe absence, or poor implementation, of fundamental policies and procedures.\n\nPolicies were either missing, sitting unread in a folder, or not embedded into daily practice. In other words, providers had the documents but no systems to turn them into action.\n\nIn this article,Dr Richard Duneunpacks why so many providers continue to fail inspections and how you can avoid the same fate by putting structure, leadership, and accountability at the centre of your compliance and care delivery.\n\nWhen CQC inspectors visit, theyre not just looking for a tick-box policy folder or cloud-based platform. They want to know:\n\nCan this provider consistently deliver safe, person-centred care and prove it with evidence?\n\nTime and again, inspection reports reveal the same recurring problems. Below are some of the most common failures identified in CQC reports from 2023 to 2025.\n\nThese arent just oversights; theyre apparent breaches of CQC regulations. The most frequently cited ones include:\n\nIts crucial to understand that these failings are rarely about bad apples. Instead, they reflect a lack of internal systems, oversight, and structure.\n\nMost providers have a set of policies. But in far too many cases, they are:\n\nA policy thats not read, understood, applied, and audited is effectively useless.\n\nCQC inspectors know this. Thats why they dont just ask if you have a policy, they ask:\n\nThis is where ComplyPlus makes the real difference. Its not just a document library; its a fully integrated compliance management system.\n\nComplyPlus helps you:\n\nWe designed it to address the structural reasons why providers fail inspections rather than just providing generic templates.\n\nTo help providers address the issues most commonly found in CQC inspection reports, we developed the ComplyPlus 10-Policy Framework, a strategic toolkit aligned with regulations, risk areas, and operational needs.\n\nLets explore each of the 10 areas and how ComplyPlus helps you build lasting compliance.\n\nFailure:No audit cycle, no quality dashboard, no governance structure.\n\nRegulation:Regulation 17  Good governance\n\nSolution:Build monthly audit schedules, add real-time dashboards, and maintain governance logs for senior oversight. Non-conformities and actions are tracked automatically.\n\nFailure:Missing or templated risk assessments for key clinical and behavioural risks.\n\nRegulation:Regulation 12  Safe care and treatment\n\nSolution:Use condition-specific templates with review reminders. Integrate risk alerts into care plans to prevent incidents before they occur.\n\nFailure:No PRN protocols, MAR sheets missing data, no audits.\n\nRegulation:Regulation 12  Safe care and treatment\n\nSolution:Weekly digital audits, eMAR integration, and real-time medication tracking with staff competency validation.\n\nFailure:Incomplete recruitment checks and induction.\n\nRegulation:Regulation 19  Fit and proper persons\n\nSolution:Pre-employment checklists, automatic alerts for DBS and references, plus links to rota software to prevent unsupervised deployment.\n\nFailure:No training evidence or role-specific skills mapping.\n\nRegulations:Regulations 12 & 18\n\nSolution:Individual training records with built-in assessments, gap analysis, and CPD audits linked to care packages.\n\nFailure:No MCA or DoLS documentation.\n\nRegulation:Regulation 11  Need for consent\n\nSolution:Capacity assessment templates, best-interest decision logs, and MCA audit tools. Assign MCA champions to promote compliance.\n\nFailure:Unreported concerns, no logs, poor staff awareness.\n\nRegulation:Regulation 13  Safeguarding\n\nSolution:Supervision prompts, safeguarding in team meeting agendas, and automated alerts for incident tracking and whistleblowing follow-up.\n\nFailure:Generic or copy-paste care plans.\n\nRegulations:Regulations 9 & 10\n\nSolution:Co-produced templates, review cycles, and tools to involve families and advocates.\n\nFailure:Complaints ignored, no learning loops.\n\nRegulations:Regulations 16 & 20\n\nSolution:Central complaint tracker, RCA tools, and structured reflective practice sessions to foster accountability and learning.\n\nFailure:Cultural needs ignored, no language support.\n\nRegulation:Regulation 10  Dignity and respect\n\nSolution:EDI assessment tools, format/language preferences embedded in care planning, and mandatory cultural competency training.\n\nYes, the care sector is under pressure. Recruitment is tough. Budgets are squeezed. However, the most consistent reason providers fail isnt a lack of resources; its a lack of structure.\n\nEven the most caring team cannot deliver high-quality care without the following:\n\nOutstanding care isnt about luck. Its about leadership and repeatable systems.\n\nWe created ComplyPlus at The Mandatory Training Group to help providers move from survival to sustainability.\n\nYou get more than a digital binder of policies; you gain a compliance framework built for action:\n\nBest of all? You dont need to overhaul your entire system. ComplyPlus integrates with your existing infrastructure and is easy to roll out, even for small providers.\n\nWhether youre:\n\nNow is the time to act. CQC inspections are changing, but your approach doesnt have to be reactive.\n\nCQC failures dont come out of nowhere. They are predictable, preventable, and, most importantly, fixable.\n\nIf your team lacks structure, your systems dont support good practice, and your policies dont translate into action, youre at risk. But with the right tools and leadership, you can create a culture of continuous improvement.\n\nDont wait until youre in crisis. Invest in structure. Build in quality. Stay inspection-ready.\n\nAt The Mandatory Training Group, we created ComplyPlus to help providers embed lasting quality into everything they do, from policies and training to audits, supervision, and beyond.\n\nExplore our complete compliance ecosystem:\n\nLearn more aboutComplyPlusand discover how were helping providers across England deliver safe, effective, and well-led services.\n\nDr Richard Dune is the CEO of LearnPac Systems, a leading UK provider of edtech and compliance software solutions for regulated sectors.
