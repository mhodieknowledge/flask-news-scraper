            "content": "IOL\n\nCoffee entrepreneur, Sbu Nkolothi, the owner and inspiration behind Coffee LAB in Ballito, was chosen as Kwazulu Natals top coffee venue in the Battle of the Beans competition sponsored by Selati Sugar.\n\nNkolothi hails from Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe where he started out as a golf caddy before moving to Durban during the FIFA World Cup in 2010. After a variety of odd jobs, he started working at a popular restaurant where he learned to make coffee and appreciate good food.\n\nSoon, he was making coffee at workspaces and learning everything he could from the coffee mentors who took him under his wing.\n\nHe also became interested in the history of coffee making and studied everything he could about it. He went on to train baristas, which he says was an important opportunity to uplift people and develop skills that would, ultimately, lead to work opportunities.\n\nIn 2020, he opened Coffee LAB, which was almost an immediate hit. However, this extremely modest entrepreneur believes the value of good coffee does not remain in the cup. Coffee brings people together. It connects them. When I make coffee, Im able to engage in and build relationships with them through my coffee. I love people, he says.\n\nAsked how he was drawn to coffee, Nkolothi says: The funny thing is coffee found me  it was a surprise. I started in 2010 as a barista at Mama Lucianas. It was my big coffee break and there was this big coffee machine and I was the guy. The coffee was just giving me peace and love and connecting me with people ever since.\n\nHe then started a facebook page to learn more and connect with coffee professionals all over the world. Everything started to shape up. I was understanding what coffee was all about, training myself, and communicating with people. Coffee is more about character.\n\nAttitude is everything. You can be the best barista in the world but if your character is not right, you are not authentic.\n\nHe soon started training other baristas.\n\nThe Coffee Lab was a dream. It was never meant to be a coffee shop, but more a coffee cabin, he says. Retrenched in 2020, he got a call from the art gallery to open in the foyer. When something is meant to be, its meant to be, Nkolothi says. Up until today coffee has been a passion.\n\nNkolothi has three young girls and loves reading. He also loves it when people drop by to watch football. Hes a Liverpool fan.\n\nThe first runner up in the Battle of the Beans was Lineage, Hillcrest whose owner, Craig Charity, has been at the forefront of coffee roasting and making in KZN for over a decade.\n\nThe second runner up was another relative newcomer to the industry, Skyline Salt Rock. Originally the coffee shop was part of Skyline Coffee Roasters in Morningside but new owner, Darren Lewis, bought the shop in 2023. He says he bought the venue due to its great community spirit. He was a former regional manager for Vida e in KZN.\n\nA good coffee shop is about serving consistently good coffee and food, knowing every regulars coffee order and name. We have over 100 regulars who come to the store five to six times a week, he says.\n\nTop barista was Keagon Chavoos from Crane Flower Coffee in Kloof.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nTURNER farm residents in Mt Hampden, who are facing displacement to pave way for the development of the new multi-million-dollar Zim Cyber City project, 26 kilometres northwest of Harare, are appealing to the government to provide a clear timeline for their relocation.\n\nThe displacement will affect thousands of residents, but the affected persons say the uncertainty is hindering them from making long-term plans.\n\nThe cyber city, estimated to cost around US$60 billion when complete, will be part of Zimbabwes proposed new administrative capital, also known as New Harare.\n\nAs a precursor to the evictions, the government unilaterally exhumed about 1 000 graves between June and August last year, to pave way for the project.\n\nThe cyber city is being developed by United Arab Emirates-based industrial conglomerate Mulk International, which has injected an initial US$500 million.\n\nAn investigation conducted by NewZimbabwe.com, in conjunction with Information for Development Trust last year, revealed the community was in panic and fear as it faced eviction, relocation uncertainty, and job losses.\n\nThe residents, many of whom have lived in the area for decades have nowhere else to go.\n\nTamira Rufaso (40) said she and other residents were anxious because they do not know what lies ahead for them.\n\nWe are just hanging, waiting for something to happen, we are living on the edge, she said.\n\nThe Ministry of Local Government last year told this publication that affected residents would be moved by mid-2025 and that the government would find them a place to settle.\n\nResidents however say they have not been formally informed of the relocation.\n\nCosmas Mandipwanya, who has been living in Mt Hampden since 1994, pleaded with the government to communicate its position.\n\nWe are pleading with the government to at least give us enough information. They should give us the timelines so that we know when we are leaving and where we are going so that we can plan using the governments calendar, he said.\n\nRight now, I cannot even do a six-month or one-year project because we are scared that anytime we may be evicted.\n\nKungonzwa mota ichiuya wakutofunga kuti wavingwa kuzodzingwa (each time you see a vehicle approaching,you think they have come to evict you), he said.\n\nAnother resident, Amos Basi (48), said residents cant plan.\n\nWe are waiting to hear from the government. We have children to provide for, and right now we cannot even plan for the future. We cant even do our small projects like chicken rearing or gardens Basi said.\n\nResidents also said they were anxious about the impact the evictions would have on their childrens education.\n\nI have grandchildren in exam classes, some in primary school and another one in secondary school, and I am scared that we may get evicted before they write exams. If that happens, what will I do with them? Where will they go and learn?\n\nEphraim Kurushiwe (62), who has called Mt Hampden home since 1997, said his biggest fear is the risk of being homeless at an old age.\n\nI am asking the government to give us accommodation when they move us, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, President Emmerson Mnangagwas spokesperson, George Charamba, dismissed the residents plight on one of his X handle in November last year.\n\nSome stories hadzina mushumo, (are useless). Imagine a story featuring one seemingly distressed farm laborer standing in front of some dingy tenement of one room, all against a headline which says, thousands in distress from displacement by proposed Cyber City!\n\nThe solution implied in the article is that the Cyber City, which, like all cities, will house millions, has to wait for the sake of this wretch and his equally wretched tenement.\n\nTinombofungawo here tisati tanyora zvinyaya zvedu, nhai vanyori nevapepeti venhau (do you think before writing your stories) or we just believe in obstructive journalism, however stupid and futile? Charamba wrote.\n\nEfforts to get a comment from the local government ministry were fruitless. The ministrys spokesperson Gabriel Masvora kept saying he was looking for the information.\n\nMost of the affected residents have no other place to go, as they are mainly children of deceased farm workers originally from Mozambique, Malawi, and Zambia, with some from Zimbabwe.\n\nBetween the early 1900s and the mid-1960s, a significant number of people migrated from Malawi (then known as Nyasaland) to Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia) for various reasons, including the pursuit of higher-paying jobs.\n\nNyasaland, like Zimbabwe, was a British colony but was more densely populated and less economically developed. This economic disparity prompted many to move in search of better employment opportunities.\n\nDuring the same era, Zimbabwe also drew labourers from Mozambique and Zambia.\n\n",

It is not correct that all medicines werecoming through USAID, I think it was 31%.\n\nWe have medicines to takeus up to the end of June but by June, we will have replenished.\n\nPeople should not panic, there is enough medication and medication will be available forever, Mombeshora said.\n\nMombeshora also said the termination of USAID funding has led to job losses for healthcare personnel in HIV treatment clinics, disrupted transport for remote healthcare access, and has forced the ministry to seek additional funding to address these challenges.\n\nThe health ministry will be approaching Parliament for support during the supplementary budget for review.\n\nWe are therefore seized with scouting for replacements. The other challenge that we are facing pertains to vehicles and motorbikes which were used by healthcare personnel to access remote clinics.\n\nMotorbikes which were used to transport blood samples were also affected by theexecutive order.\n\nThis has culminated into a situation where our Ministry is in the process of requesting extra funding to cater for such key personnel, Mombeshora said.\n\nBefore the funding cut, Zimbabwe used to receive over $200 million annually from the U.S. Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and the U.S government has given Zimbabwe over $1.7 billion since 2006 to strengthen health systems and support people living with HIV.\n\n",

This process resulted in the identification of 10 bodies through previous arrests in the country, he said.\n\nThe 10 were identified through the police database, which showed they were arrested in Jane Furse, Burgersfort, Welkom, Barberton and Kwa-Mhlanga.\n\nMokgwabone confirmed that one is South African, seven are from Mozambique and the others from Lesotho and Zimbabwe.

Suka-Mafudzes email sets out the key messages she wants the lobby group to take to its meeting with team Trump. One of her proposals includes the line: Countering Chinese Influence.\n\nSuka-Mafudze writes that the US could benefit from Zimbabwes strategic location in Southern Africa, its critical minerals, and its workforce while reducing the regions dependence on Chinese investments. Aligning with Zimbabwe could counterbalance Chinas growing influence in the region and open avenues for US investments in agriculture, mining, and infrastructure, she adds.\n\nChina is one of Zimbabwes largest trading partners. According to the Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe, bilateral trade between China and Zimbabwe was upwards of $3.8bn, in 2024.\n\nThe US first sanctioned Zimbabwe in 2001 under the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act. This suite of sanctions was based on allegations of political repression, election rigging, land seizures, and corruption under former President Robert Mugabe.\n\nFormer US President Joe Biden ended this sanctions programme in March last year, unblocking all individuals, entities, and property previously affected.\n\nHowever, the US then proceeded to impose new targeted sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Programme on 11 individuals and three entities.\n\nThose sanctioned included Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, first lady Auxillia Mnangagwa, and first Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nThe US has hit back against claims that the sanctions are responsible for Zimbabwes economic woes, saying they target only a handful of Zimbabweans.\n\n",

            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nThe Welshman Ncube-led Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) announced on Wednesday that self-appointed party secretary general Sengezo Tshabangu had been expelled from the party for violating the party constitution.\n\nFollowing the 2023 elections, Tshabangu began purging CCC members of parliament and councillors understood at the time to be close allies of the then-party leader Nelson Chamisa, claiming that they had ceased to be party members.\n\nCritics and analysts maintain that it appeared Tshabangu was playing a long game, in cahoots with President Emmerson Mnangagwas Zanu PF, to hijack the CCC party then led by Chamisa after the latter refused to acknowledge Mnangagwas 2023 election victory, citing irregularities which were also recorded in several election observer mission reports.\n\nNcubes CCC charged Tshabangu with four counts and found him guilty on all four.\n\nIn a statement issued on Wednesday, party spokesperson Willias Madzimure said that Tshabangu had contravened the party constitution clause 9.1.2.3.\n\nMadzimure stated that in November and December, Tshabangu had made changes to CCC Parliamentary Portfolio holders without the authority of the President or any organ of the party. He said Tshabangu had breached the partys constitution rules and regulations in that he brazenly defied the authority of the President of the CCC, the National Standing Committee, the National Executive Committee, and the National Council.\n\nOn the second count, Tshabangu was found guilty of making public pronouncements on changes to party representatives in parliament without first seeking the approval of the President of the CCC or its organs, namely the National Standing Committee, the National Executive Committee, and the National Council.\n\nOn the third count, the CCC stated that Tshabangu had brought the name and reputation of the party into disrepute by making changes in Parliament without the approval of the party organs.\n\nOn the fourth count, Tshabangu was found guilty of disrespecting the office of the President of the CCC and its organs by making derogatory remarks in the public media, where he made statements after his suspension from the party.\n\nHaving found Sengezo Tshabangu guilty of all the charges, and having regard to the gravity of the acts of misconduct of which the Committee convicted him, the Committee decided to sentence him to expulsion from the party with immediate effect, part of Madzimures statement reads.\n\nMadzimure added that he was uncertain whether Tshabangu would appeal, but implied that this expulsion could follow to give him a taste of his own medicine because he was the one who started the purging of party representatives from Parliament and local authorities.\n\nNewZimbabwe.com made efforts to reach Tshabangu, but he did not answer his mobile phone.\n\nHowever, one of his lawyers, Kucaca Phulu, confirmed that Tshabangu had appeared before the CCC party Disciplinary Committee but said he was not the one who spoke on behalf of Tshabangu and directed questions to fellow lawyer Nqobani Sithole.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Sithole rubbished the disciplinary Committee, its verdict, and its sentence, describing it as a charade. They do not have that power. They do not have structures. Structures that can exercise that power are not in existence at the moment. It is a charade, he stated.\n\nWhen asked why Tshabangu had appeared before a committee that he described as a charade, Sithole said his client had appeared to simply tell them that they are a charade.\n\nLast December, Ncubes group dragged Tshabangu to the High Court for pronouncing parliamentary changes without consulting his party organs. The High Court ruled in favour of Ncubes group before Tshabangu appealed the same ruling at the Supreme Court. The matter is yet to be heard.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nCITIZENS Coalition for Change (CCC) legislator Darlington Chigumbu has said that the governments initiative to compensate former white farmers overlooks the disadvantaged black workers who toiled on the farms.\n\nThe government recently announced that it is disbursing US$20 million to farmers who were displaced as a result of the land reform process aimed at addressing historical injustices in the early 2000s.\n\nThe 94 farmers, hailing from countries such as Switzerland and Germany, are covered under Bilateral Investment Protection and Promotion Agreements (BIPPAs) that Zimbabwe signed with the farmers countries of origin.\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncube said that the compensation is for the developments the farmers carried out on the farms prior to their displacement.\n\nSpeaking in the National Assembly recently, Chigumbu argued that the programme is ignoring the historical injustices suffered by native workers while developing the farms.\n\nIt is a good thing that our country is honouring its commitments. I would want to bring to the attention of this House that we need to be cognisant of the fact that there are some historical injustices that happened as these people acquired the land. It is a good thing that the Ministry is saying they are paying these people for the developments that were made on the land that was repossessed around 2000.\n\nHowever, they should also not be blind to the fact that the developments that these people are now being paid for, actually came as a result of labour practises that were near to slavery and our grandfathers are no longer there to be part and parcel or to also claim with these farmers to say they also contributed to the development of that particular piece of land as well as not being treated fairly.\n\nIt is also sad that this whole arrangement seems not to be taking into consideration these people who participated in the development of these particular pieces of land, said Chugumbu.\n\nThe government has faced criticism from opposition groups for compensating landowners whose land was forcibly taken from local inhabitants during the colonial era.\n\nChigumbu further suggested that there should be a mechanism to ensure that the native workers who laboured on these farms are also compensated.\n\nThe third aspect is that when the land was re-distributed, the big guys are the ones who took parts of the farm land which was properly developed and l can tell that they are not part and parcel of this whole arrangement.\n\nMy prayer is that can this arrangement include a model whereby these people who are going to receive the payments of the developments that they have done on these pieces of land also pay the people who worked on these pieces of land, which they were not paid fairly during the time they were working on these pieces of land?\n\nI understand most of these people are no longer alive but is it not also prudent Mr. Speaker Sir, to say that they can give back to the communities where their farms are located so that they can also pay something? The reason would be because they are now benefiting from something they did not pay for in as much as we are talking about the developments that were done on the pieces of land that they are now being paid for, he said.\n\n",
