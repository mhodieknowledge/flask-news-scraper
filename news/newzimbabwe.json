She said collaborative work between the MSD and its regional partners indicated generally favourable rainfall patterns across the country.\n\nIn general, from November to January, the northern part of the country is normal to above normal rainfall, said Manzou.\n\nThe bulk of the country,which includes Manicaland, Masvingo, most of Mashonaland East, Harare Metropolitan, much of Midlands, the southern parts of Mashonaland Central and West, the south-eastern part of Mashonaland North, Bulawayo Metropolitan, and the bulk of Matabeleland South,has an increased chance of above normal rainfall.\n\nShe added, Also, from November to January, in the northern and western parts of the country, there is an increased chance of normal to above normal rainfall. So, we are at a good place as a country.\n\nFor the period December 2025 to February 2026, Manzou said rainfall is expected to remain within the normal to above-normal range, with the same trend likely to continue from January to March.\n\nHowever, she cautioned that rainfall patterns may vary from month to month, with nearer forecasts being more accurate.\n\nNovember will have normal to below normal rainfall. So, we are already in November and, in general, we are not talking of site-specific forecasts.\n\nFor December, rainfall distribution in the southern parts of the country will be higher compared to the northern parts.\n\nJanuary is expected to have a normal to above normal; February, normal to above normal it is a cumulative rainfall pattern, she explained.\n\nManzou urged farmers to seek advice from Agritex officers in their respective areas and avoid planting before the onset of effective rains.\n\nThe MSD is also monitoring temperature trends for the season. Despite recent hot weather, the conditions donot qualify as a heatwave.\n\nAccording to the MSD, temperatures for November to December are expected to be warmer than normal, while December will likely experience cooler-than-normal conditions.\n\nIt is now cooler, except in the extreme north, where it is still very uncomfortable (hot), Manzou said.\n\nFrom January to February 2026, temperatures are projected to remain cooler than normal across the country.\n\nManzou reminded stakeholders that the forecast issued was for total cumulative rainfall amounts, expressed relative to long-term averages, and that the MSD also issues daily, three-day, and 10-day forecasts for more precise weather guidance.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner atMadzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. This week we want to discuss the law of succession as it relates to agricultural land in Zimbabwe. What are the main considerations?\n\nVM:Thank you\n\nBefore delving into the laws of succession in agricultural land, it is necessary that I first address how agricultural is held in Zimbabwe. Agricultural land is held either through title deeds, 99-year leases, leases with an option to purchase, offer letters, permits or customarily as rural land under Rural District Councils.\n\nThese forms of holding confer personal rights to the holder except in title deeds, where the holder has real rights to the land. The personal rights titles emanating from Land Reform, being mainly permits, offer letters and 99-year leases, are a result of potentially one of the most significant wealth transfer events in post-colonial Africa.\n\nThe land itself is owned by the state and occupiers have usufructs on the land to use, enjoy and earn from it.\n\nThis background or understanding is necessary as it has a direct effect on succession.\n\nSuccession itself has become topical as farming by its very nature is a generational business.\n\nIf land reform started around 2000, it means the process is now 25 years old and cases of succession by heirs are now commonplace.\n\nReporter: You highlight land reform beneficiaries, that is A1 and A2. What is the process when the initial beneficiary dies?\n\nVM:It is important that we first differentiate the A1, being a small holder farm held under a permit from the government and an A2 farm being a large-scale commercial farm held under an offer letter or a 99-year lease.\n\nI understand that the current government policy is aimed at issuing deeds for these holders. I will discuss on succession for deeds later on. For now, I will restrict myself to permit, offer letter and lease holders.\n\nFirst thing to understand is that the land under these models belongs to the State and not individuals, therefore, succession in its strictest sense, which is through the Master of the High Court, is only for improvements and movable property.\n\nIf its for land, then the succession or reallocation of land to an heir has to be approved by the government who is the landowner. When the estate of the late holder is being administered, the value of the land is not included in the process as it does not belong to the estate but the government.\n\nMaking the process twotier\n\nFor A1 farms, the surviving spouse and dependants may succeed although the successor has to be approved by the Minister of Lands. The process is done through the District Lands office within 3  6 months after the death of the land owner, depending on whether or not there are disputes. In situations of disputes, spousal rights are protected and consideration is also given to potential successors who developed the farm.\n\nThe process is similar for A2 offer letters; there is a need for an application to the Ministry of Lands district office with the required documents, which is dealt with by the Valuation and Estate Management section. As part of its consideration, it will assess, among other things, the capacity to farm, whether or not the potential heir has other farms et cetera.\n\nAs for lease holders, it is governed by general inheritance laws; the executor, upon completing the beneficiary identification process, will still be required to make an application to the Minister for approval of allocation.\n\nReporter:What issues may inhibit or stop the A1 or A2 farms being re-allocated or distributed to the selected beneficiary?\n\nVM:I am forced to start by reiterating that the rights conferred by offer letters and or leases are personal in nature. This makes it necessary for the beneficiary or potential heir to prove the rights to the Ministry of Lands.\n\nSuch proof is through the offer letter, permit or lease granted to the deceased. A failure to prove implies that the late occupier may potentially have been an unlawful occupier.\n\nIn the absence of proof, the Ministry of Lands has no obligation to re-allocate the land to the selected heir. As there may be back and forth between the offices, it is important that copies of correspondence with the Ministry are kept judiciously in the event there is a need for them to be reproduced\n\nReporter: What is the inheritance position for rural kumusha land when it comes to inheritance and farms having a title deed?\n\nVM:Communal land is vested in the President and administered by the Rural district Councils through traditional leaders being chiefs and headmen. Their inheritance for use is normally through family lines.\n\nAs for farms having title deeds, they fall under our normal inheritance laws under the purview of the Master of the High Court. The Ministry of Lands does not have jurisdiction over these types of farms.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

The original concept always had influencers, crime and counterfeit bags at its core, although the story did evolve in development. Bad Influencer allowed me to explore these worlds with humour, social tension and emotional depth, while still having fun with the wildness of internet culture.\n\nShe tells Drum that she also wanted to interrogate how we measure value in a world where women dont have power or financial freedom.\n\nInfluence, beauty, wealth and success are often curated illusions, and chasing them without grounding can feel exhilarating but can be dangerous. That said, I also want audiences to laugh, reflect, and question the ladders we climb to attain power and social currency.\n\nLed by Jo-Anne Reyneke, Cindy Mahlangu and Thapelo Mokoena, the cast brings to life the female-driven crime story rooted in the belly of Johannesburg streets.\n\nArt plays in the hands of reality as the Zimbabwean producer also leads in various male-dominated creative spaces.Im redefining power on my own terms. Im taking up space, building ecosystems instead of waiting for permission, and creating opportunities for others as I climb. My responsibility is not just to tell stories, but to help create platforms and initiatives where African women can own, build and lead their creative futures.\n\nShe explains how she bridges storytelling across TV, comics and gaming.\n\nI build worlds first. The medium becomes an extension of the universe. Each platform deepens the audience experience and longevity of the intellectual property (IP). Africa doesnt yet have the full transmedia infrastructure, but thats also the opportunity. The goal is not just to make content from one IP, but also to build entire story universes with unique offerings at each product vertical, from video games to merchandise, to animation and film.\n\nIP is legacy. Its economic freedom. Its how we build generational wealth in storytelling, she adds.\n\nFrom as far back as she can remember, her imaginative mind has always bred stories itching to be told.\n\nAs a child, I would write my own version of Peter Rabbit stories, and later, Id write plays in high school. That instinct followed me into journalism, and eventually into film production and screenwriting. For me, storytelling has always been a way of making sense of human behaviour, power, identity, and possibility.\n\nHer upbringing between different cultures, countries and identities also turned her perspective into a muscle she could exercise from an early stage in her life.\n\nWith a background in journalism, I also learned to observe and question narratives early in my career. Id like to believe that my upbringing shaped my hunger, resilience, and belief in creating things that outlive me, whether thats a story world, a book, a platform, or a shift in how we imagine African stories.\n\nOver the years, the creative in her late 30s has been part of international fellowships and labs in which shes championed feminine power and ownership.\n\nNow with Bad Influencer out on Netflix, shes already on to the next project. Her new project is Artemis Elixa; she shares with Drum what its all about.\n\nArtemis Elixa is a pan-African sci-fi franchise about a brilliant engineer from the future who time-travels back to stop a rogue super-intelligence from taking over humanity. Each mission sends her across the continent, from Congos mineral frontlines to Nairobis tech corridors.\n\nWith each mission, she confronts power, exploitation, and the ethics of progress. Its an African answer to Lara Croft meets The Terminator, with a touch of Black Panther, grounded in our real-world trajectory of technology, geopolitics, and African innovation. Its part graphic novel, part game, part cinematic world. The comic will be launching in 2026, she concludes the conversation with Drum.\n\n",

The group now expects inflation to ease further, possibly reaching 15% to 20% by December 2025.\n\nThe decline follows two consecutive months of negative month-on-month inflation and a relatively stable ZiG, which rising global bullion prices have supported, according toReuters.\n\nThe policy target is for an annual ZiG inflation of about 30%. The negative month-on-month inflation for the past two months has helped increase chances of this happening, the CZI said in its October 2025 Inflation and Currency Developments Update.\n\nAs Zimbabwes main business lobby for manufacturers and industrial firms, the CZIs reports are closely watched by investors as early indicators of inflation and currency trends.\n\nThe ZiG, partly backed by gold, has remained stable in official markets, with a parallel-market premium of about 20%, according to analysts at Oxford Economics.\n\nGold production is also expected to surpass the record 38.4 tonnes achieved in 2024, driven by sustained high prices.\n\nAfter more than two decades of currency turmoil and runaway inflation, Zimbabwes recent progress marks a tentative return to stability.
