            "content": "By Xinhua\n\nTHE upcoming China International Import Expo (CIIE) offers a gateway for Zimbabwean horticultural products to enter the Chinese market, enabling local businesses to directly connect with Chinese buyers and partners, a Zimbabwean exporter has said.\n\nIn a recent interview with Xinhua, Tatenda Mukazi, marketing director of Procitru Investments, a Zimbabwean private company that contracts the growing of fresh produce and other horticultural crops mainly for export, said the CIIE is expected to open new avenues and unlock more growth opportunities for Zimbabwean exports to China.The expo will be held in Shanghai from November 5 to 10. According to Chinas Ministry of Commerce, this years event will feature an expanded special zone for African products, with the number of participating African enterprises increasing by 80 percent year on year.We are going to exhibit blueberries, avocados, avocado oil and macadamia nuts, said Mukazi, who will attend the CIIE for the first time.Zimbabwes blueberries are set to enter the Chinese market following the signing of an export deal during Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwas visit to China in September. A trade protocol on Zimbabwean avocado exports was also signed last September, a move that has excited local farmers eager to access the Chinese market.For this trip, we are going to look for markets, meet buyers and explore machines that can process blueberries into juice for export. We are also looking for partners to do business with, Mukazi said.The expo will also allow him to better understand Chinese market dynamics and systems.I am going to visit their supermarkets and facilities to see how they operate, how they run their systems, and their payment methods, so that we move on the same page, he added.One of Mukazis key goals is to secure direct export agreements with Chinese businesses.I am aiming to meet real buyers so that we can cut off all the middlemen. This is why I am pushing for this trip to be successful, he said.With years of experience in exporting fresh produce, Mukazi works closely with Zimbabwean farmers to identify markets and facilitate exports. He said that the Chinese market represents a significant opportunity for local exporters and that the CIIE serves as a vital bridge connecting Zimbabwean farmers with one of the worlds largest consumer markets.The expo, he added, allows Zimbabwean exporters to showcase a broader range of products beyond the countrys traditional exports such as minerals.Now we are venturing into horticulture, citrus, avocados and berries. For us, it is a great opportunity. We need to show the Chinese market that we are not only buyers; we also have value to offer back home. We can be customers to them, and they can be customers to us, said Mukazi.For us, it is a challenge. We need to up our game and be ready for big deals. It is a new adventure, a new market, and great exposure for us, he added.Beyond opening new export markets, Mukazi sees the CIIE as a platform to deepen partnerships with Chinese companies. As trade with China expands, he said, there is a growing need to work with Chinese partners to increase value addition for local produce such as avocados and blueberries.Already, we have local companies processing avocado oil. On this trip, we are going to bring some samples to market and see how the Chinese market responds, Mukazi said.\n\nIn a recent interview with Xinhua, Tatenda Mukazi, marketing director of Procitru Investments, a Zimbabwean private company that contracts the growing of fresh produce and other horticultural crops mainly for export, said the CIIE is expected to open new avenues and unlock more growth opportunities for Zimbabwean exports to China.\n\nThe expo will be held in Shanghai from November 5 to 10.

That is loyalty, l stand with the President, his two vice presidents, his ministers and advisors.\n\nI am saying this because there are rumours circulating to the effect that l want to takeover from my father (Mnangagwa). I am not a mentally deranged to plot to takeover from my fathers role when he is still in that position, said Tungwarara.\n\nZanu PF national commissar Munyaradzi Machacha and Provincial Affairs Minister Misheck Mugadza were among high-ranking party officials, who attended the event.\n\nAffiliates which received varying amounts of money included Boyz DzaMudhara, Crossborders4ED, Pastors 4ED, Hairdressers 4ED, among others.\n\nHimself a controversial character whose family members flaunt wealth on social media while abroad on shopping jaunts, Tungwarara is a beneficiary of Mnangagwas governments largesse, with his Prevail International Group getting lucrative tenders.\n\n",
