            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nDESPITE threats of termination of contracts, University of Zimbabwe (UZ) lecturers remain defiant, cranking up pressure on government and the institution to increase, tenfold, their salaries to US$2,500 per month.\n\nThe lecturers, who have been on industrial action for a month, are pressing ahead with picketing, vowing not to return to class until government accedes to their demand for an upward review of their paltry earnings.UZ administrators responded heavy-handedly, threatening to replace the striking lecturers, with reports indicating that the adjunct tutors would be earning US$3 per hour.The Association of University Teachers (AUT) spokesperson, Obvious Vengeyi, blasted UZ for failing to attract applications for the posts.It is true that the University of Zimbabwe has hired experts to replace the real experts, who are on a lawful and constitutional strike, demanding a restoration of their salary to pre-October 2018 rates, whereby a junior lecturer got US$2,250 per month before it was slashed to only US$230, which they are currently getting.The so-called experts are hired as adjunct lecturers. That means they are not replacing the real experts. It was the university administrations hope that they would get hundreds of them so that the university would return to normal business.Unfortunately, the experiment failed spectacularly. The whole university failed to attract more than 10 across all its 11 faculties. All 10 are not qualified to teach at high school. They were pulled from the streets and from churches. It is a joke, to say the least, said Vengeyi.Last week, UZ was further plunged into chaos after the Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) staged a flash demonstration, demanding the return of lecturers.The students criticised the UZ administration for pressing ahead with examinations when they had little lecture time. The striking lecturers have disassociated themselves from overseeing examinations.Vengeyi told NewZimbabwe.com that the situation at UZ is dire and might deteriorate if the institution and the parent government arm Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education  do not address their grievances.The university is paying only US$5.50 per hour. It is not even enough for transport and lunch. The AUT, therefore, did not see any reason to interfere with their process. The situation at UZ as of today is pathetic. There are no classes taking place until we receive US$2,250. That demand must be met.If that is not met, then there is no graduation this year. Block 4 should have started on Monday, 19 May, but it failed. Nothing is happening. Remember too that Block 3 failed. This means if the situation remains the same for the next week, this semester is off, said Vengeyi.\n\nThe lecturers, who have been on industrial action for a month, are pressing ahead with picketing, vowing not to return to class until government accedes to their demand for an upward review of their paltry earnings.\n\nUZ administrators responded heavy-handedly, threatening to replace the striking lecturers, with reports indicating that the adjunct tutors would be earning US$3 per hour.The Association of University Teachers (AUT) spokesperson, Obvious Vengeyi, blasted UZ for failing to attract applications for the posts.It is true that the University of Zimbabwe has hired experts to replace the real experts, who are on a lawful and constitutional strike, demanding a restoration of their salary to pre-October 2018 rates, whereby a junior lecturer got US$2,250 per month before it was slashed to only US$230, which they are currently getting.The so-called experts are hired as adjunct lecturers.

I am asking for an apology from them because somehow I think that they think that the law works for them or belongs to them. Even I can be protected by the law. If its a crime, a magistrate is going to determine that. The law is going to determine that, said a defiant Silent Killer.\n\nHe went on to warn that he is under the protection of Prophet Walter Magaya if they dare to poke him.\n\nI read that letter and I cant say sorry that I was the one who leaked. The letter was sent to my lawyers, this is between the lawyers. Remember Im the son of Prophet Magaya, so whatever you plan on me, rains will pour, said Silent Killer.\n\nIn the letter of demand, Y2K Entertainment alleges that they incurred substantial expenses, including cost of three airfare tickets and various payments made to facilitate his travel and Visa application.\n\nWe are instructed by our client to demand, as we hereby do; that you pay the sum of USD122, 170 (One hundred and twenty-two thousand one hundred and seventy United States Dollars) which amount is now due to our client and must be paid within seven (7) days of being served with this letter.\n\nYou are also further expected to pay US$12, 217 (Twelve thousand two hundred and seventeen United States dollars) being our collection commission, reads part of the letter.\n\n",

village in Mberengwa.Mpofu bought rat poison and laced the milk in her childs feeding bottle.Having no place to sleep she approached a Good Samaritan Florence Dhaka, who gave a place to sleep.Throughout the night, the baby cried persistently, and in the morning the Samaritan suggested taking the baby to the hospital, the court heard.The baby was pronounced dead upon arrival at Zvishavane General Hospital.The matter was initially reported as sudden death.Nurses who testified told court that Mpofu had told them that her baby was battling flu.After the death was reported at

            "content": "By Cricinfo\n\nBEN Duckett brought up his fifth Test hundred and first at his home ground at exactly a run ball. Zak Crawley got a first Test century since July 2023, 28 innings ago. Between them, they shared in Englands highest-opening stand at home since 1960.\n\nOllie Pope added the trimmings with his third hundred in as many Tests at Trent Bridge and eighth against as many different oppositions and England scored the most runs on the first day of a Test in England. If that reads like all-out dominance, it was.It was also a rude welcome for Zimbabwes XI, none of whom had played a Test in England before, and many of whom will not remember the last time their team were in the country 22 years ago.After Craig Ervine chose to bowl first under cloudy skies, Zimbabwes four-seam, single-spinner attack struggled for consistency and were hurt by the loss of one of their cogs for most of the day.Opening bowler Richard Ngarava left the field ten minutes into the second session with what was later confirmed to be a back spasm. He returned an hour and five minutes into the third, with a ginger step. He fielded for a few minutes but was soon back in the dressing room, which limited his days work to nine overs in the morning.Premier seamer Blessing Muzarabani, who was also the most threatening of the quicks, bowled 20 overs while Sikandar Raza delivered 24 overs but little Zimbabwe tried hurt England. The hosts top-order batted with exactly the right mix of caution and aggression, though the scoring rate of 5.66 would suggest only the latter.Duckett and Crawley started with some circumspection and the first six overs brought just 19 runs. But that was as good as it got for Zimbabwe as boundaries came soon after, and regularly.Crawley announced himself with a cracking drive through the covers, which was followed by Duckett taking on Muzarabani off the front and back foot. After 10 overs, Ervine made his first change and introduced Tanaka Chivanga, whose opening over cost 12.Chivanga was the only one to find some swing and Duckett had a nervy moment when he miscued a drive into the off side but there was no fielder close enough to attempt a catch.Duckett lashed the next ball over the slips and to the boundary to bring up fifty off 47 balls. Crawleys fifty came in Victor Nyauchis first over, when he whipped the ball through square leg and ran a comfortable two, and England went to lunch on 130 for 0.Zimbabwe thought they had some luck in the over after the break when Nyauchi, from around the wicket, believed he had found Ducketts edge. It turned out to be a flick of his jumper. At the end of that over, Duckett edged Nyauchi between wide slip and gully and moved into the 80s. He reverse-swept and cut Raza to enter the 90s and then worked him square for a single to bring up his century.Still, Zimbabwes hopes of seeing the back of Duckett were kept alive. On 104, he popped Nyauchi a return chance but the ball fell short. And then Duckett went full throttle. He cut Chivanga over cover point and pulled him over deep backward square for the first six of the match, and seemed unstoppable.With Duckett on 130 and Zimbabwe all but out of options, Wessly Madhevere was brought on and immediately hit for four through the covers and then launched over midwicket for six.Against the run of play, Duckett hit Madheveres next ball straight to Ben Curran at cover and could not believe what he had done. He trudged off as Zimbabwe enjoyed their first smiles of the day, only to look up and see Pope.In the first 18 balls he faced, Pope hit six fours, a sign of what was to come. By tea, Pope was on 49 off 46 balls. Crawley, content with the supporting act, had worked his way to 93.Popes fifty came two balls into the third session and he had reached 61 when Crawley got a leading edge off Nyauchi and ran the single that took him to three figures. His sedate celebration seemed to spell relief, not jubilation, and could quieten criticism ahead of sterner challenges to follow. He added 24 more runs before missing a sweep against Raza, to be given out lbw. Crawley reviewed but replays showed it was hitting leg stump.Popes charge continued undeterred with an array of strokes all around the ground and his hundred came up with a cut. It marked the eighth different opponent he had scored a century against. The milestones kept coming as Joe Root became the fifth player to score 13,000 Test runs and the numbers may have made Zimbabwe giddy.They took the second new-ball as soon as it became available and it only gave England more scoring opportunities. Root hit the first delivery for four, then Pope took two more fours off a tiring Muzarabanis 17th over (and ensured he conceded 100) to reach 150.To add insult to injury he followed an Nyauchi inswinger and helped it over fine leg, which meant England had scored 22 runs off seven deliveries. It did not all go their way, however. Muzarabani finally had some reward when he sent down a surprise bouncer and Root top-edged to Sean Williams at fine leg.That was as much reward as Zimbabwe got as Pope and Harry Brook batted out the rest of the day to finish two short of 500. Pope was unbeaten on 169 off 163 balls.\n\nOllie Pope added the trimmings with his third hundred in as many Tests at Trent Bridge and eighth against as many different oppositions and England scored the most runs on the first day of a Test in England.

He cut Chivanga over cover point and pulled him over deep backward square for the first six of the match, and seemed unstoppable.With Duckett on 130 and Zimbabwe all but out of options, Wessly Madhevere was brought on and immediately hit for four through the covers and then launched over midwicket for six.Against the run of play, Duckett hit Madheveres next ball straight to Ben Curran at cover and could not believe what he had done. He trudged off as Zimbabwe enjoyed their first smiles of the day, only to look up and see Pope.In the first 18 balls he faced, Pope hit six fours, a sign of what was to come. By tea, Pope was on 49 off 46 balls. Crawley, content with the supporting act, had worked his way to 93.Popes fifty came two balls into the third session and he had reached 61 when Crawley got a leading edge off Nyauchi and ran the single that took him to three figures. His sedate celebration seemed to spell relief, not jubilation, and could quieten criticism ahead of sterner challenges to follow. He added 24 more runs before missing a sweep against Raza, to be given out lbw. Crawley reviewed but replays showed it was hitting leg stump.Popes charge continued undeterred with an array of strokes all around the ground and his hundred came up with a cut. It marked the eighth different opponent he had scored a century against. The milestones kept coming as Joe Root became the fifth player to score 13,000 Test runs and the numbers may have made Zimbabwe giddy.They took the second new-ball as soon as it became available and it only gave England more scoring opportunities. Root hit the first delivery for four, then Pope took two more fours off a tiring Muzarabanis 17th over (and ensured he conceded 100) to reach 150.To add insult to injury he followed an Nyauchi inswinger and helped it over fine leg, which meant England had scored 22 runs off seven deliveries. It did not all go their way, however. Muzarabani finally had some reward when he sent down a surprise bouncer and Root top-edged to Sean Williams at fine leg.That was as much reward as Zimbabwe got as Pope and Harry Brook batted out the rest of the day to finish two short of 500. Pope was unbeaten on 169 off 163 balls.\n\nCrawley announced himself with a cracking drive through the covers, which was followed by Duckett taking on Muzarabani off the front and back foot. After 10 overs, Ervine made his first change and introduced Tanaka Chivanga, whose opening over cost 12.\n\nChivanga was the only one to find some swing and Duckett had a nervy moment when he miscued a drive into the off side but there was no fielder close enough to attempt a catch.Duckett lashed the next ball over the slips and to the boundary to bring up fifty off 47 balls. Crawleys fifty came in Victor Nyauchis first over, when he whipped the ball through square leg and ran a comfortable two, and England went to lunch on 130 for 0.Zimbabwe thought they had some luck in the over after the break when Nyauchi, from around the wicket, believed he had found Ducketts edge. It turned out to be a flick of his jumper. At the end of that over, Duckett edged Nyauchi between wide slip and gully and moved into the 80s.

            "content": "By Newzwire\n\nKARO Platinum has completed earthworks at its new mine in Ngezi and is in advanced talks to raise an additional $165 million to complete the project, which has faced significant delays due to low platinum prices.\n\nManaging Director Bernard Pryor says the company has so far spent $140 million on developing the mine, which will be Zimbabwes third-largest platinum producer upon completion.Earthworks are always challenging, but weve completed them to 100%, Pryor said during a call with analysts on Thursday.The project will have a 132 kV powerline, while the Chirundazi Dam has been built to supply water.Its a big project, but everything that we need is in close proximity, he added.Karo has opened a tender for a mining contract to begin stripping overburden and prepare for mining.This is a large contract; we need a highly competent mining contract to move an extensive amount of material, some 1.41.5 million BCM (bank cubic metres) per month, said Pryor.On funding, Tharisa Financial Director Andrew Henwood says: We are in advanced talks with a lending syndicate, South African and African banks. We are targeting $165 million of that funding.Karo has already raised $37 million through a bond on the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange and may extend the facility. It may also raise between $50 million and $100 million through a gold streaming agreement, where a buyer provides upfront capital for a share of gold produced as a by-product.As far as the timing is concerned, we are looking at first ore in mill starting 15 months after we close the fundraising, Henwood said.Sitting on the Great Dyke, Karo will include a 10-year open-pit phase and a 30-year underground mine, producing 226,000 ounces annuallybehind Zimplats (646,000 oz) and Unki (244,000 oz).Karo had hoped to complete the mine in 2024, but had to push back timelines due to the collapse in global platinum prices, which has stalled investment across the industry.Phoevos Pouroulis, CEO of Tharisa, said: While we have slowed development at the Karo Platinum Project in line with capital availability, we have nevertheless continued work on infrastructure, water dams and further optimisations including commencing with studies for the future underground mine development, while presenting the opportunity to non-traditional financiers, who like us, see the long-term benefits of the uniqueness not only of this Tier 1 project but of the applications PGMs will play for decades to come.The Zimbabwe government has a free 15% stake in the mine, and has an option to buy a further 11%.\n\nManaging Director Bernard Pryor says the company has so far spent $140 million on developing the mine, which will be Zimbabwes third-largest platinum producer upon completion.\n\nEarthworks are always challenging, but weve completed them to 100%, Pryor said during a call with analysts on Thursday.The project will have a 132 kV powerline, while the Chirundazi Dam has been built to supply water.Its a big project, but everything that we need is in close proximity, he added.Karo has opened a tender for a mining contract to begin stripping overburden and prepare for mining.This is a large contract; we need a highly competent mining contract to move an extensive amount of material, some 1.41.5 million BCM (bank cubic metres) per month, said Pryor.On funding, Tharisa Financial Director Andrew Henwood says: We are in advanced talks with a lending syndicate, South African and African banks.
