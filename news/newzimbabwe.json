            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nA faction backing Vice President Constantino Chiwenga to succeed President Emmerson Mnangagwa when his constitutional term ends in 2028 has emerged from the just-ended Zanu PF National Peoples Conference nursing deep political wounds.\n\nThe conference opened with a tense Politburo meeting at the ruling partys headquarters, which marked the start of an intensified onslaught by Mnangagwas loyalists against Chiwengas camp.\n\nZanu PFs Secretary for Legal Affairs, Ziyambi Ziyambi, delivered a strongly worded response to Chiwenga, who had earlier expressed discontent over the alleged capture of the party by a clique of influential figures.\n\nZiyambis statement effectively drew battle lines within the ruling party, setting the tone for the Mutare conference, where delegates resolved to amend the constitution to extend Mnangagwas tenure, a major setback for Chiwengas succession ambitions.\n\nPolitical analyst Rejoice Ngwenya says it will take an extraordinary strategy for Chiwenga to recover from the political setback suffered at the just-ended Zanu PF conference.\n\nThe tragedy is that Chiwenga himself has not said he has any interest in succeeding Emmerson Mnangagwa. There are people talking on his behalf, the Bombshell Gezas, but Chiwenga has not publicly expressed interest in higher office.\n\nHowever, from experience, we know that during the turbulence at the end of Robert Mugabes rule, Mnangagwa never openly declared his ambitions to succeed Mugabe. He kept quiet and did most of his machinations behind the scenes.\n\nSo we might be hearing a lot of noise about the Chiwenga faction, but we do not know what is happening in the background. His silence says a lot because it would be unwise for him to speak openly about it now, whatever plans he may have. But from where I stand, given the mandate and legitimacy Mnangagwa enjoys within Zanu PF, it would take a miracle for Chiwenga to recover from this, said Ngwenya.\n\nZanu PF is reportedly preparing a constitutional amendment in Parliament to allow President Mnangagwa to remain in power beyond the 2028 elections.\n\nHowever, the ruling party faces major legal hurdles, including Section 91(2), which bars a president from seeking a third term, and Section 328(7), which prohibits an incumbent from benefiting from a constitutional amendment enacted during their tenure.\n\nA leaked dossier, allegedly authored by Chiwenga, claims that Zanu PF intends to smuggle a document titled Breaking Barriers Initiative (BBI) into Parliament to suspend elections and extend both the presidents and the legislatures terms.\n\nNgwenya, however, dismissed the documents credibility, which is said to be linked to self-imposed CCC Secretary General, Sengezo Tshabangu.\n\nBBI is moribund because it tinkers with the illusion that you can simply change the constitution to achieve anything. My assumption is that not everyone within Zanu PF supports this agenda.\n\nThey might not say it publicly, but its nave to assume that if this matter goes to Parliament, it would automatically pass. BBI is just an academic document, Ngwenya said.\n\n",

            "content": "Music in Africa\n\nTheZimbabwe Musicians Union(ZIMU) has called for an immediate review of the 2024 audit report of theZimbabwe Music Rights Association(ZIMURA), citing alleged governance failures, misrepresentation, and breaches of corporate protocol.\n\nIn an open letter dated 19 October 2025 addressed to Baker Tilly Chartered Accountants, ZIMURAs auditors, ZIMU presidentEdith Katijiaccused the firm of overlooking several procedural and ethical irregularities in its audit of the music rights body. The letter was also copied to the Companies and Intellectual Property Office (CIPZ), the Ministry of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture, and the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ).\n\nQuestions over audit validity\n\nKatiji claimed that ZIMURAs 2024 audited financial statements failed to comply with the organisations Articles of Association. She said the report was signed by only two individuals, board chairpersonAlbert Nyathiand executive director Polisile Ncube-Chimhini, without the mandatory third signature from the company secretary. According to Section 59 of the Articles of Association, the company seal must be accompanied by two directors signatures and that of the secretary.\n\nZIMU further argued that the document was invalid because Ncube-Chimhini allegedly signed under a title that does not exist in ZIMURAs governance structure. The letter cited a High Court ruling in Farai Fred Nyakudanga v Polisile Ncube-Chimhini (HH 438-25), which found that she does not hold the position of executive director.\n\nAlleged omission of material facts\n\nKatiji criticised the auditors for failing to disclose Ncube-Chimhinis reported fraud conviction, while noting that the audit made reference to unrelated legal cases such as Simbisa Brands Zimbabwe (Pvt) Ltd. She said the omission of information about the conviction undermined the integrity and transparency of the report.\n\nWhile every citizen has the right to appeal, the conviction stands until overturned, Katiji wrote. Responsible governance demands immediate suspension, not concealment or legitimisation.\n\nThe musicians body alleged that ZIMURA continues to face multiple governance and legal challenges, including police investigations into fraud and misappropriation of funds, as well as ongoing court cases involving board members. ZIMU said the auditors failure to reference these matters amounted to a serious breach of professional responsibility.\n\nThe letter also raised concerns about the accuracy of the directors list in the audit report, stating that it did not match official records lodged with the Deeds Office. It named Philip Chipfumbu as one of the directors omitted from the published list.\n\nAuditor independence questioned\n\nZIMU questioned Baker Tillys professional conduct, suggesting that the firm may have relied on information supplied by ZIMURAs management without independent verification. The union said the audit created confusion by alternately assigning responsibility for financial statements to both management and the board, which contradicts ZIMURAs Articles of Association.\n\nKatiji urged the audit firm to withhold the report from presentation at ZIMURAs Annual General Meeting (AGM) scheduled for 22 October 2025, warning that using the document to guide governance decisions would be reckless and a breach of ethical responsibilities.\n\nZIMU has requested an urgent reassessment of the 2024 audit, public disclosure of Ncube-Chimhinis legal status, and cooperation with regulatory authorities to restore transparency. The union also called for scrutiny of ZIMURAs legal adviser, Witness Zhangazha, who has reportedly been referred to the Law Society of Zimbabwe over alleged misconduct.\n\nKatiji said the credibility of both ZIMURA and Zimbabwes audit profession was at stake if the issues were not addressed.\n\nNeither ZIMURA nor Baker Tilly had issued a public response to the letter at the time of publication.\n\n",

In accordance with World Health Organisation (WHO) protocols, the detection of even a single confirmed case necessitates the declaration of an outbreak, prompting health authorities to launch an immediate response.\n\nThe MoHSS has assured the Namibian public that the countrys robust surveillance system is primed to identify and monitor individuals exhibiting signs of mpox. Additional cases are being actively sought, while health authorities in the Erongo region are closely monitoring the patients immediate contacts to prevent further spread of the virus.\n\nMpox is a zoonotic disease caused by an orthopox virus, resulting in smallpox-like symptoms in humans. This outbreak follows a concerning trend, as multiple countries within Africa, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Zambia, Malawi, and Tanzania, are reporting active mpox cases.\n\nMpox symptoms typically manifest after an incubation period ranging from 5 to 21 days and can include:\n\nThe rash often appears on the face, palms, and soles of the feet, and can also affect the mouth, genitals, and eyes. Symptoms generally last from two to four weeks, during which the infected individuals are capable of transmitting the virus to others.\n\nHuman-to-human transmission occurs primarily through direct contact with respiratory secretions, bodily fluids, or skin lesions of an infected person. The MoHSS outlines several potential avenues for transmission, including:\n\nAs mpox can affect anyone regardless of demographic, the MoHSS urges the public to take preventive measures. These include:\n\nIn light of this outbreak, the MoHSS has mobilised necessary resources to respond effectively, emphasising the importance of public cooperation. Citizens are encouraged to remain calm and to refrain from spreading unverified information, which could instigate unnecessary panic or stigma towards affected individuals and their families.\n\nAs Namibian health officials continue to monitor the situation closely, ongoing updates will be provided to keep the public informed. The health and well-being of all citizens remain a top priority for the government and health authorities.\n\n",
