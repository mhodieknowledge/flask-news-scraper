Team captain Marvellous Nakamba, who plies his trade in England, joined camp later in the evening, while other European-based players are expected to arrive on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe clash carries more than just qualification hopes; national pride and regional bragging rights are also at stake in this long-standing rivalry.\n\nZimbabwe, who sit bottom of Group C with four points, are already out of contention for World Cup qualification, while South Africa remain in the hunt, sitting second with 13 points, nine ahead of the Warriors.\n\nMeanwhile, Bafana Bafana have suffered a major setback after key player Relebohile Mofokeng was ruled out due to injury.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference on Monday, South Africa coach Hugo Broos confirmed that Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Mduduzi Shabalala has been called up as Mofokengs replacement.\n\nWe replaced him with Shabalala. Second, there are two players who have not arrived because they played yesterday , thats (Lyle) Foster and (Sphephelo) Sithole. They will arrive tomorrow (Tuesday) morning, and in the afternoon, we will be complete, said Broos.\n\n",

While the other children managed to flee, the victim was mauled to death by the dogs.\n\nHer body was later discovered with multiple deep cuts and teeth marks.\n\nThe National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) argues that letting dogs run loose is not merely a nuisance but is a failure of the owners duty of care, which is a criminal offence.\n\n",

Local silence allows rivers to turn into sludge. The Chinese did not corrupt our system, they found it already for sale, Chasi wrote.\n\nThe former energy minister argued that environmental destruction in Zimbabwe reflects a broader governance crisis rather than foreign exploitation alone.\n\nThis isnt a Chinese problem. It is a governance problem. If rules can be bought, someones selling, he added.\n\nEvery destroyed riverbed tells a local story, a signature, a bribe, a blind eye. Foreign miners only exploit the vacuum we created.\n\nBlaming outsiders has become a fashionable, convenient self-deception. Environmental destruction thrives because enforcement is selective and oversight compromised, Chasi wrote.\n\nThe reform we need is not about nationality; it is about integrity.\n\nUntil our institutions stop trading ecological integrity for quick cash, nothing will change. The Chinese did not destroy our mountains and rivers. Our signatures did, he added.\n\n",

What this means is that the appellant never disputed the terms of the contract as spelt out by the respondent and never disputed breaching the contract.\n\nThe church had paid Rockshade for the hire of a new 60-seater bus to transport congregants to a seminar in Botswana.\n\nBut it later discovered the company only had a single 50-seater already hired out. Rockshade then offered an old 57-seater bus instead  a move that left the church with 60 confirmed travellers but only 57 seats.\n\nMCZ described the replacement bus as very old, with worn seats, a dirty fridge and toilet, and earmarked for scrapping. The court said this amounted to a clear breach.\n\nBy refusing to avail the 60-seater bus (having earlier misrepresented to the respondent that it had the bus), the appellant repudiated the contract, the judgment stated.\n\nThe respondent acted properly in suing for a refund the moment the appellant indicated its unwillingness to be bound by the terms of the contract.\n\nThe High Court partially allowed the appeal only to remove a Magistrates Court directive that the refund be paid within 24 hours, ruling instead that Rockshade must simply pay the money and costs of suit.\n\nAll other grounds of appeal are red herrings. Nothing turns on them,Chikowero ruled.\n\nEach party was ordered to bear its own costs of the appeal.\n\n",

There is no rule of evidence that excludes it, he held.He further clarified that while the testimony might cast Mbondiya in a bad light, it was allowed under Section 33(a) of the Civil Evidence Act [Chapter 8:01], which permits character evidence in damages claims where reputation is directly at issue.This is not an issue of admissibility but of weight, Justice Dube-Banda said.
