With his entrepreneurial parents full support  and encouragement to pursue formal education  he began his career, carefully tracking every cent spent. Their belief in his vision laid the foundation for his success, and he remains deeply grateful for it.\n\nBeyond the decks and designer fits, Oscar is also a devoted family man. In a recent podcast, he opened up about his love for his family and his role as a father.\n\nI just want to keep inspiring the youth, guiding them, and helping them avoid the mistakes we made, he shared, looking forward to the next chapter of his journey.\n\nOscar Mbo is also the founder and lead voice behind The Ashmed Hour, a popular entertainment podcast that blends music and thoughtful conversation  showcasing not only his talent but his depth as a creative.\n\nNow, with Vuka being considered for a Grammy,Oscar Mbostands at the edge of a new era. Whether or not he clinches the nomination, one thing is clear: hes more than just a sharply dressed entertainer  hes an art.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in Harare has urged its nationals and investors operating in Zimbabwe to strictly comply with local investment laws, regulations, and ethical standards.\n\nIn a notice issued this week, the embassy reminded Chinese investors to conduct thorough due diligence and risk assessments before undertaking any projects in the country.\n\nThe advisory follows mounting concern over a recent fatal shooting of a villager at a Chinese-owned mine in Mutoko, allegedly on suspicion of attempted theft. The incident has reignited public debate over the conduct of some Chinese investors, with calls for government to review foreign operations after the Centre for Natural Resources Governance (CNRG) released a video exposing poor working and living conditions at a Chinese-run mine in Mashava.\n\nPrior to committing capital, undertake a comprehensive and thorough assessment of Zimbabwes political, economic, social, and legal landscape. Go beyond financial metrics to gain a good understanding of the local investment climate, business culture, community dynamics, and socio-cultural norms including traditions and customs, the embassy said.\n\nIt added: Scrutinise all project details, with a particular focus on identifying potential risks and avenues for resolving disputes, establishing robust risk management protocols from the outset. Avoid involvement in any ventures that might lead to controversies or disputes.\n\nThe embassy also called on investors to prioritise personal and asset security.\n\nImplement proactive security measures upon arrival. This includes engaging reputable professional security services, optimising physical safeguards, and developingthen regularly rehearsingcomprehensive contingency plans for possible emergencies.\n\nAmid growing criticism over some investors alleged disregard for due process, the embassy reminded its citizens to resolve disputes through legal channels and to observe firearm regulations.\n\nAdhere strictly to legal and regulatory frameworks. Compliance with Zimbabwean laws and regulations is the non-negotiable foundation of all operations.\n\nAll disputes must be resolved through proper legal channels. Proactively seek advice and assistance from qualified legal counsel. In the event of criminal incidents such as theft, burglary, or robbery, while ensuring your personal safety, your immediate priority is to report the incident to the local police without delay. Should the police be unreachable or unable to dispatch officers immediately, you should remain calm and composed, and try to avoid any direct confrontation.\n\nEnforce strict firearms control. The illegal possession of firearms is strictly prohibited. The storage and use of any legally authorised firearms must be managed with the highest level of control and in full compliance with relevant regulations.\n\nThe embassy further encouraged Chinese companies to foster goodwill through responsible community engagement and environmental stewardship.\n\nAct as a partner in Zimbabwes development. Wherever possible, engage with local communities respectfully and responsibly. Consistently uphold fair labour practices and demonstrate environmental stewardship in line with all relevant laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility initiatives are strongly encouraged as visible expressions of goodwill. Such proactive efforts foster mutual trust, strengthen community relations and affirm a shared commitment to Zimbabwes broader economic development and social progress.\n\nThe statement also emphasised that any grievances or threats to personal safety must be handled lawfully.\n\nIf faced with unfair treatment or rights infringement, remain calm and rational. Meticulously collect and preserve all relevant evidence. Your primary recourse is always through the established legal framework, supported by professional legal representation.\n\nIn the face of smears or disinformation, a proactive and strategic response is crucial. Engage legal counsel and seek assistance from relevant authorities to manage the situation and protect your reputation and legitimate rights and interests.\n\nThe embassy reiterated that corruption and bribery are criminal offences both in Zimbabwe and China.\n\nUnder no circumstances should bribes be offered, accepted, or solicited. If you encounter any form of corruption, including solicitation, extortion, or abuse of power, report it promptly to the Zimbabwe Republic Police and/or Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission.\n\nIn light of growing reports of labour and human rights abuses involving some Chinese-run enterprises, the embassy urged all companies to register with it after obtaining licences from relevant Zimbabwean authorities.\n\nThis, it said, would enable the embassy to provide timely consular protection and assistance when required.\n\n",

Thats being reflected in stronger company results, a 45% rise in the dollar-based Victoria Falls stock exchange and a property boom.\n\nIts also helping the ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, which was launched in April 2024 and marked the sixth effort to establish a viable local currency after high inflation and collapsing foreign-exchange values scuppered previous attempts.\n\nIt has only weakened by 3% against the dollar this year amid tight monetary policy, a far cry from the collapses suffered by its predecessors.\n\nStill, the Harare-based asset manager warned that fragility remains with the nations unsustainable debt levels a threat. Fiscal pressures forced Zimbabwes Treasury last month to order spending cuts to government ministries. It owes creditors $21 billion after defaulting in 1999 and efforts to seek a debt revamp have so far failed to yield fruit.\n\n",

Mtisi approached the court seeking a declaration that the marriage had ended and for Mimana to resume the US$20,000 monthly payments he allegedly stopped in February 2025, despite having consistently paid that amount since March 2024.\n\nMtisi told the court she was unemployed and had been excluded from the couples lucrative businesses, despite holding a 50% stake. She said the companies were financially sound, citing lucrative Jet A1 fuel supply contracts and profitable mining operations. She argued Mimana was well able to meet the US$21,936 in monthly expenses and contribute to her legal costs.\n\nMimana denied personally paying the US$20,000, claiming it was the company that had made the payments for the upkeep of the family. He accused Mtisi of failing to account for the funds and said payments stopped after she engaged in activities that disrupted the smooth running of the company.\n\nHe further disputed that she was a shareholder and insisted she was not entitled to dividends or business proceeds.\n\nBut in his ruling, Justice Fatima Maxwell found that Mimana had the means to continue supporting his wife, noting that even if the company had made the payments, it acted on his behalf.\n\nIt is common cause that the applicant has been dependent on the US$20,000 per month she was getting. The bottom line is that she has no source of income except the contribution she was receiving, the judge said.\n\nRespondent has not disputed that he is unilaterally running the company and that the US$20,000 was being paid on his behalf. He is therefore in a position to contribute to the applicants legal costs whether personally or through the company.\n\nThe court trimmed some nonrecurring and tutoring costs from Mtisis claim, disallowing US$10,210 in total, leaving US$11,726 as the payable monthly amount.\n\nOn Mimanas technical objection that Mtisis affidavit was improperly commissioned, the court described it as a desperate attempt by the respondent to avoid going into the merits of the matter.\n\nThe application for maintenance pendente lite and contribution towards costs be and is hereby granted,  she ruled.\n\n",
