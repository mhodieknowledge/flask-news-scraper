It was redesigned last year with new styling, a smaller size and a new engine.\n\nSome men of the cloth who have also benefitted from Chivayo also include gospel singerCharles Charamba who received a Toyota GD6 Fortuner from Chivayo last year.\n\nChivayo, who has made a habit of showering various musicians, comedians, pastors and others with top-of-the-range vehicles  right down to the humble Toyota Aqua  has once again opened his chequebook.\n\nToday, Chivayos, shall we say,unconventional generosityhas extended to the founder of Divine Kingdom Baptist Ministries, Ndlovu, a gesture that has certainly set tongues wagging.\n\nWhat I admire most is that you NEVER use the pulpit to sow division, but rather, you have used it to foster DIALOGUE and RECONCILIATION, Chivayo wrote on his social media pageson Thursday.\n\nYou have carried the Zimbabwean FLAG on your shoulders with pride, patriotism and DIGNITY, a reminder that God still has a plan for our GREAT nation of ZIMBABWE.\n\nIn recognition of your remarkable contribution to the BODY of CHRIST and for remaining a true SERVANT of GOD, I am pleased to extend my small TOKEN of appreciation, a brand spanking new 2025 Toyota Land Cruiser 300 Series VXR for you and also a brand new 2025 Toyota Fortuner 2,8d GD6 for your one and only wife MRS NDLOVU to enable her travel easily when she does her amazing charity work all over Matebeleland.\n\nChivayo also gifted Ndlovus wife with US$50,000 to support her charitable endeavours.\n\nPlease go to FARAMATSI MOTORS at their Club Chambers showroom, corner Nelson Mandela Avenue and 3rd Street and see FARAI. Both your cars are paid for in FULL and ready for collection.\n\nA further donation of 100 thousand dollars towards the completion of your church and another 50 thousand dollars towards Mrs Ndlovus charity work will be deposited into your church bank account, he added on his X account.\n\nTRIBUTE TO A TRUE SERVANT OF GOD\n\nIn my entire LIFETIME, I have met a FEW true PROPHETS of GOD, who remain full of HUMILITY, despite having an exceptional GIFT of prophecy, EVANGELISM and giving spiritual COUNSEL to the Nation.

(@wicknellchivayo)April 10, 2025\n\nIan Ndlovu is the Founder and Executive Chairman of Divine Kingdom Baptist Ministries [DKBM]  Global, Divine Kingdom TV, and Johanan-Ian Leadership Trust. Ndlovu is a firm believer in striking a balance between the ministration of Gods Word, the Bible, and the gifts of the Holy Spirit.\n\nHowever, Ndlovus latest donation from Chivayo has likelypoured fuel on the fireof public suspicion that he is a state-planted operative, albeit in a church, aiming to control the masses through the Bible.\n\nIn his latest prophecy, Ndlovu appealed to Zimbabweans to pray for their country. saying thatthe spiritual world showed him a Zimbabwe confronted by serious chaos as a result of decisions to be made by those in power at the moment.\n\nMany have questioned Chivayos source of income, which allows him tosplash the cashwith such abandon.\n\nWhile not addressing him by name, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga described Chivayo and his ilk as Zvigananda, meaning those who steal from state coffers with a straight face  essentially,robbing Peter to pay Paul.\n\nHowever, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, unlike his Deputy, who described Chivayo as a chigandan, believes Chivayo is a genuine entrepreneur.\n\n",

These educators are being persecuted not for misconductbut for courageously organising and demanding fair wages that reflect the dignity of their labour, ARTUZ noted.\n\nIt is appalling that instead of engaging meaningfully with the AUTs legitimate demand for the restoration of pre-October 2018 salaries pegged at US$2,500, UZ management has chosen to weaponise disciplinary processes to intimidate and punish union leaders, the union added.\n\nThe suspensions, the labour body went further, were a direct assault on workers rights, academic freedom, and the constitutional right to freedom of association.\n\nARTUZ condemned the suspensions, describing them as an anti-worker, authoritarian attempt to suppress labour organising in the higher education sector.\n\nThe demand for living wages is not riotousit is righteous. The balloting exercise held by AUT reflects democratic principles, not disruption. If anything, it is managements refusal to address salary erosion that is disrupting higher learning.\n\nWe remind authorities that education cannot thrive in an environment where educators are punished for demanding fair treatment. This attack on AUT is an attack on all educators across the country, ARTUZ said.\n\nTo our colleagues in AUT, we say: You are not alone. Your fight is our fight. Your resilience is an inspiration to every underpaid and overworked teacher across Zimbabwe.\n\nARTUZ demanded that the vice chancellor and his executive immediately reverse the suspensions and engage AUT in good faith. The union also appealed to the Higher and Tertiary Education Ministry to intervene and protect the rights of tutors.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nINDIVIDUALSwho have donated blood at least ten times, with their most recent donation within the past year, can have their biological parents, children, or spouse receive free blood in times of medical need, the National Blood Services Zimbabwe (NBSZ) has announced.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, NBSZ said it has a Blood Components Beneficiary Policy, which grants free blood transfusions to family members of regular donors who meet the criteria.\n\nWe would like to announce that NBSZ has a Blood Components Beneficiary Policy designed to ensure that our donors are adequately recognized and cared for. Under this policy, blood donors who have given blood ten times or more, with their last donation made within the past 12 months, are entitled to free blood for their biological parents, children, or spouse should they require a blood transfusion.\n\nNBSZ is committed to doing whatever it takes to ensure that blood donors are well-catered for, the statement reads.\n\nAlthough the government maintains that blood is always available free of charge to patients in public hospitals, the situation on the ground tells a different story.\n\nMany public hospitals, including Parirenyatwa, Zimbabwes largest referral hospital, do not consistently offer free blood transfusions.\n\nIn many instances, patients are simply told to purchase blood themselves, as it is often unavailable at the hospitals.\n\nNBSZ said that the costs associated with blood are not for the blood itself, but rather for the necessary processes involved in preparing it for safe use.\n\nIt is important to understand that once blood is donated, it does not go directly for transfusion. Instead, it undergoes rigorous testing for infections, blood grouping, separation into components, safe storage and then distribution. These processes require advanced equipment, skilled scientific personnel, specialized storage facilities and strict adherence to international safety standards.\n\nAs a non-profit organization, NBSZ strives to recover only the operational costs associated with these processes, while ensuring that blood products remain accessible and affordable to all individuals who require transfusion, NBSZ added.\n\n",

The trajectory was sustained in March 2025 when the ZWG inflation declined to settle at-0,1%.\n\nWhile a fall in prices is generally desirable, deflation can also result in adverse consequences to the economy if it is sustained. It can drive down spending, investment and impede economic growth. Thus, it is advisable for the authorities to keep an eye on inflation so that sustained deflation would signal increasing liquidity into the economy, he said.\n\nThe industry lobby group said to some extent a month-on-month inflation rate of  0.1% indicates that the monetary authorities tight monetary policy stance is paying off.\n\nProducts that registered the lowest inflation included gas, which registered the lowest inflation rate of about -6%.\n\nAlso making it to the top five on the lowest inflation rates are electrical appliances for personal care(-4%), other services (-3%), books (-3%) and stationery (-3%).\n\nThe industry lobby group said US$ monthly declined to 0.1% in March 2025, representing a 0,1% drop from February 2025s rate of 0.2%, attributable to both US$ and ZiG month-on-month inflation rates decreased.\n\nThe US$ year-on-year inflation for the month of March declined to 15%, which was a 0.1 percentage point drop from 15.1% in February 2025. Although there are signs of declining inflation, having double-digit annual inflation (10% and above) is still considered high and distorts economic decisions, especially since it pertains to foreign currency, CZI added.\n\n",

            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nZimbabwe issued treasury bonds worth $308 million and made small cash payments to White farmers who were dispossessed of their property 25 years ago under a state-backed land reform program.\n\nThe payments are the first under a so-called Global Compensation Deed signed in 2020 between the state and the former farm owners in which Zimbabwe committed to paying $3.5 billion for improvements done on the farmland.\n\nA Land Compensation Committee has approved compensation for 740 former farm owners, with the first 378 farmers paid 1% of the total compensation value of $311 million in late March as well as receiving Treasury bonds, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube said.\n\nFollowing the cash payment the balance is being paid in US dollar denominated Treasury bonds with a 2% coupon and maturities of two to 10 years, Ncube said Wednesday in a statement. The bonds, issued last week, can be sold and held by other market players including pension funds, before their maturity date, he said.\n\nThe Compensation Steering Committees Chairperson and former Commercial Farmers Union President Andrew Pascoe confirmed receipt of the payments. The former farm owners received dollar payments on March 24, he added.\n\nThe payment is the latest attempt to resolve the decades-long dispute triggered by former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe encouraging veterans of the liberation war to evict farmers and their workers from their land in a bid to win support in a close-fought election in 2000. By 2002, at least seven White farmers had been killed alongside dozens of their workers, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nThat contributed to sanctions being imposed on Zimbabwean politicians by the US, UK and the European Union leading to the southern African nations protracted fallout with the West.\n\nZimbabwe, also has a history of not paying its debts. It has been locked out of international capital markets since 1999 after it defaulted on debt from lenders including the World Bank, Paris Club and African Development Bank.\n\nIn February, Zimbabwe began paying compensation to five nations namely Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland and the former Yugoslavia and to 56 foreign nationals who despite having their farms protected under bilateral agreements had them seized. The compensation is a crucial step demanded by foreign creditors as the southern African nation seeks to restructure its debt. Zimbabwe owes 57% of its $21 billion debt pile to external creditors.\n\n",
