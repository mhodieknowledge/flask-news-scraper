            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nCATHOLIC Lawyers Guild in Zimbabwe (CLGZ) has slammed the impending order for judges to sit for training exercises by Zanu PF through its Herbert Chitepo School of Ideology, arguing that such plans violate the late national heros legacy.\n\nThe backlash follows a leaked communiqu which revealed that all judges were scheduled to participate in an induction led by the Zanu PF-affiliated institution at the Harare International Conference Centre (HICC) from the 4thto the 5thof July.\n\nThe lawyers group questioned the rationale behind organising such an exercise in the first place, arguing that it even violates the legacy of Herbert Chitepo, whom the institution is named after.\n\nForcing judges to sit through the Chitepo School of Ideology is contrary to what the late national liberation hero fought for. At the African Conference on the Rule of Law in 1961, the late national hero said that;\n\nThe legal profession consists of judges, practitioners and teachers of the law. It is to these persons that the protection and defense of the Rule of Law is entrusted. All must be as far as possible from both executive and social pressures,CLZG said.\n\nThe frustrated barristers collectively condemned the politicisation of judges training and called on all arms of the government to respect the principle of separation of powers and the rule of law, which are embedded in the supreme law of the country.\n\nThey maintained that subjecting Judges to the indoctrination exercise directly contravenes Section 164 of the Constitution, which bars any vested interests from interfering with the judiciary.\n\nSubjecting Judges who must at all times be independent and seen to be independent to an ideology of one party to the exclusion of others not only compromises the judiciary but attacks its independence and impartiality.\n\nWe note that this is all happening at a time when the public confidence in the judiciary is low, given the widely held public perception that the judiciary is captured by the Executive, added CLZG|.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities wereforced to fold their tails and cancel the training program after incessantcriticism of the exercise.\n\n",

They told the court they were coerced into drug-fuelled freak offs  which were also referred to as hotel nights or wild king nights  with male escorts, and abused throughout their relationships.\n\nCombss defence team painted a very different picture in their attempts to show that all sexual acts, including freak offs, were consensual.\n\nThey conceded the music star could be violent, had a bad temper, and used drugs. He also had multiple relationships at the same time. But crucially, they said, while he was not proud of some of his behaviour, none of it made him guilty of the charges against him.\n\nAfter hearing evidence of flights and travel for escorts and Cassie and Jane, paid for by Combs, as well as hotel bookings across the US and the Caribbean, jurors have found him guilty of the transportation to engage in prostitution charge. However, they agreed with the defence that the allegations against the rapper did not amount to sex-trafficking or racketeering.\n\nThe Cassie hotel tape\n\nCombs, known variously as Puff Daddy, P Diddy, and Diddy over the years, was once one of the most influential figures in hip-hop  famous as a producer, founder of Bad Boy Records and manager of the late Notorious BIG in the 1990s, as well as a rapper in his own right.\n\nAs an artist, he won three Grammys during his career, and had hits including Ill Be Missing You, Come With Me, and Bad Boy For Life.\n\nIn September 2023, he received the global icon award from MTV and was given the key to New York City at a ceremony in Times Square, just a few miles away from the streets in Harlem where he spent his first years.\n\nAllegations first came to prominence in November 2023, when Cassie, his girlfriend from 2007 to 2018, filed a bombshell lawsuit accusing him of coercing her into unwanted sex sessions, as well as blackmail and several incidences of violence.\n\nThe suit was settled in 24 hours  for $20m, it emerged during the trial  but months later CNNaired hotel security footageshowing Combs punching and kicking Cassie and throwing her to the floor in 2016.\n\nHe apologised after the video aired, saying: I was disgusted when I did it.\n\nFootage from the hotel incident was shown during the trial.\n\nFollowing the verdict, the rapper now awaits sentencing. He also still faces several civil lawsuits, most of which were filed in the wake of his arrest in September 2024.\n\n",

We request that bail hearing be heard on July 3 at 11.15 am.\n\nThis has been necessitated by the presentation of certain documents which contain the medical history for the accused, which we need to verify before we make our submissions on the application for bail. So we request for the matter to be rolled over to July 3 for bail inquiry, said prosecutor Takudzwa Jambawu.\n\nZabas lawyer, Chris Mhike, said, We are naturally disappointed that the accused must spend another night in custody at a time she is not feeling well.\n\nShe had been on bed rest at the time of her arrest on the orders of her medical doctor. A prison is not the best of places for people who are unwell but your worship you must place on record that the State has not dismissed our submissions on the state of health of the accused.\n\nWe so believe that the request by the State is in the best interests of the accused person.\n\nIt is our hope that such an allowance would enable the state to attend to all the necessary administrative processes.\n\nWe only seek the prosecutions assurance that there will be no further delay on tomorrows proceedings and that the accused will be allowed to receive medical attention while in detention, Mhike said.\n\n",
