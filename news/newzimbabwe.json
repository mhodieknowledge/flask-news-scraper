            "content": "By James Muonwa\n\nA REHABILITATED former inmate at Chinhoyi Farm Prison has found renewed hope of life after undergoing training in horticulture, which will be his source of livelihood post-incarceration.\n\nBernard Bennet (37), who completed a two-year jail term for robbery, at the weekend, upon his release, became the first beneficiary of the reintegration programme, receiving a horticultural starter pack consisting of a water pump, knapsack sprayer, seed and fertilizers.\n\nBennet is expected to start an income-generating horticultural project at his rural home in Zvimba.\n\nSpeaking at the handover ceremony, Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) Officer Commanding Mashonaland West, Commissioner Luke Zondai Makuvire expressed confidence that the pilot project will help reduce chances of re-offending.\n\nZPCS Officer Commanding Mashonaland West Commissioner Makuvire hands over a knapsack sprayer, among other goods, to ex-convict as he heads home\n\nWhat makes this event more special than any other release is that for the first time in Mashonaland West province, Bernard Bennet is being released and given a starter pack to go and start a new life devoid of crime, said Makuvire.\n\nThe ZPCS provincial commander noted that the event marked a major milestone in prison management as enunciated in his turnaround blueprint rolled out on May 15, 2023.\n\nThe turnaround strategy is meant to address certain challenges bedevilling the ZPCS thereby improving the welfare of both inmates and officers. This is exactly what we are witnessing today.\n\nMakuvire said the occasion marked the fulfilment of ZPCS mandate which is to protect society from criminal elements through incarceration and rehabilitation of offenders for their successful reintegration into society whilst exercising reasonable, safe, secure and human control.\n\nHe reiterated progress ZPCS has made in recent years in closing the missing link of reintegration of inmates back into society.\n\nWe have been doing well in terms of fulfilling our mandate of incarceration and rehabilitation, but the missing link has been the reintegration aspect. I am proud but remain humble that this aspect has finally been realised, said the commissioner.\n\nFormer inmate Bernard Bennet bid ZPCS officers farewell\n\nWithout reintegration, he added, ex-convicts find it difficult to join society and face rejection resulting in recidivism.\n\nAddressing guests gathered to witness the release and handover ceremony, Chinhoyi Prison Farm Officer-in-Charge Superintendent Gilbert Mavhako said Bennets release was a unique milestone.\n\nThis event is more than just the end of a prison sentence; it is a powerful symbol of renewal, personal growth, and the triumph of rehabilitation. It reflects the core purpose of our correctional efforts  to restore dignity, rebuild lives, and return individuals to society better equipped to contribute positively.\n\nBennets journey reminds us all that with the right support, opportunities, and determination, transformation is not only possible but attainable.\n\nHe is a shining example of how rehabilitation programmes can cultivate not only crops, but character.\n\nDuring his time in incarceration, Bennet did not allow his circumstances to define his future. Instead, he embraced the opportunity for growth and development through the prisons rehabilitation programmes. He dedicated himself to horticultural training, acquiring hands-on experience in crop production, nursery management, soil preparation, composting, and sustainable irrigation techniques.\n\nThe produce from the farm not only fed fellow inmates but also supported prison operations, giving him a clear purpose and a feeling of being useful once again.\n\nOn his part, Bennet thanked the ZPCS command element led by Commissioner Makuvire for moulding him into a better and purposeful citizen.\n\nI promise to put the skills and resources to good use and rebuild my life free of crime. I will never return to this system as a criminal but to give back to a system that gave me a fresh start to life, said Bennet, who returns to his wife who stood by him throughout his incarceration.\n\nThe reintegration initiative will benefit inmates pursuing other vacations in animal husbandry, crop production, tailoring, carpentry, among other projects.\n\nThe initiative reinforces ZPCSs commitment to ensuring the rehabilitation of offenders and supporting their reintegration into the community through practical empowerment initiatives.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nEXPERTS last week unpacked the Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill to legislators and mining stakeholders amid calls to consider provisions that ensure small-scale indigenous miners are prioritised due to their significant output ahead of foreigners.\n\nAlso topical was the issue of Cadastre Registry and funding of artisanal miners in the sector.\n\nMembers of Parliament (MPs) warned of chaos if some parts of the proposed law, alleged to be pro-foreign investors than local people, were not amended as expected by the generality of the populace.\n\nAccording to Mines Committee Chairperson and Bindura South MP Remigious Matangira, the Bill must have Zimbabweans as priority and not foreigners.\n\nArtisanal miners are producing 60% of all these minerals especially gold. To my surprise, they are not even mentioned in in the Bill.\n\nThe small-scale miner has been restricted now to 48 hectares onlyStill, the view is favouring the foreign minds.\n\nOur Bill should not want to take investors to be the foreign people that come into the country as investors. It is good to be us, we are good to graduate, to be the owners of our land, our culture, and gradually they will move forward, Matangira said amid applause from other MPs.\n\nOf concern to the Mines Committee chairperson was the Cadastre Registry system structure as presented by the government legal counsel.\n\nThe Cadastre Registry establishes a Mining Cadastre Registry headed by the Secretary of Mines and it mandates the disclosure of beneficial ownership of mining rights, empowering the Registrar to demand sworn declarations and cancel titles where beneficial owners are not properly disclosed.\n\nThe system creates the Mining Cadastre Register as the definitive record of all mining rights and titles in Zimbabwe, accessible online for public inspection.\n\nMatangira, warned, You know we are coming in with a Cadastre system. It will cause more serious issues than we ever saw.\n\nHe urged the Bill to amended to speak to what the people of Zimbabwe are making for their minerals.\n\nNyanga South MP Supa Mandiwanzira also chipped in suggesting that the country has a fantastic opportunity to shape the mining sector that could make millionaires and billionaires out of blacks as part of the resources that are available home.\n\nTheres no mining that takes place in this country without the traditional leadership. It does not matter where that investor is coming from.\n\nYou have to have consultation with the traditional leadership, but theyre not being represented on the mining affairs board.\n\nI would like them in adjustment that the traditional leaders are appointed to that specific board.\n\nMandiwanzira added, there is something heartbreaking happening in our country, which I think this law must impress.\n\nThere is nothing technologically innovative about a heaping fence or processing fence and taking that money outside the country. We are seeing alluvial, chrome mining, alluvial gold mining even on the rivers being done by foreigners. Basic thing that does not need technology.\n\nThe investors from outside must bring technology to do things we cant do. This law must restrict alluvial mining, river mining, whether its chrome or gold, to indigenous people\n\nMandiwanzira called for exclusive, prospective license (EPL) period to be limited from 12 years to only six.\n\nIf you have not found anything in 12 years, what are you still doing there? I believe that this period must not be extended to 12 years. I think it must come to six years, said Mandiwanzira.\n\nOn traing Mandiwanzira said, Whats happening in this country is heartbreaking. A lot of foreigners are approaching people who are holding claims because our people are desperate.\n\nThey are giving away these claims in return for 10% of what comes out of there. That money is not building our country. Its being shipped outside the country.\n\nBut if our people are training to understand that the value they are giving away is far more than what these guys are bringing, We would not have those things that are heartbreaking taking place.\n\nThis Bill must provide the necessity to educate all our people about the relevance and the criticality of mining.\n\nWe saw a big deal happen in the sale of Prospect Mining to Huayo Cobalt in China, $450 million.\n\nIts money that has exchanged hands outside of our territory, no tax accrual to our country. But this, what is about with assets being sold, this law does not address how that is going to be handled to ensure that the exchange of ownership of assets, whether it is on the Australian Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange or the Canadian Stock Exchange, benefits the tax collection in our own country. I did not see any provision of that in this situation, the MP said.\n\nAnother MP spoke of value addition and the beneficiation.\n\nHow practically are we putting some measures to make sure that there is no continuous mining without value addition and proficiency?\n\nSpeaker Jacob Mudenda spoke about several issues as he gave his personal opinion.\n\nExploration needs to be done as a compelling exercise. Where are the minerals?.\n\nHe spoke of value addition and benefiation, artisanal miners resource development (provision of a fund) , indigenisation and authorisation of the mining industry and the Cadastre system, which he said, were a must in the Bill to be included.\n\nArtisanal miners are producing 60% and fund them so that they can go to 90% in the end.\n\nThe Cadastre system, the Bill does not create the harm. The Cadastre system is going to be harmonised nationally. We should have one Cadastre system that can be used by not only the Mines and Mining Development ministry, but a new contract that must have access to that, and other ministries that are involved in the development of issues that should be used and therefore, they should be clearly engaged with this affair generally, in terms of the mapping.\n\nIt is very important. As long as the Cadastre system is not in place, then we have not started, said Mudenda.\n\n",

We are not only issuing mining claims but also providing equipment so they can actively participate in the mining value chain.\n\nHe revealed plans to drill boreholes in each of Zimbabwes 35,000 villages.\n\nThis, he said, would underpin agro-based, community-managed businesses to tackle food insecurity, boost horticultural exports, and lift rural incomes.\n\nThese initiatives are mitigating the impact of climate change and guaranteeing household food security, he said.\n\nMnangagwas remarks come at a time when Zimbabwe continues to grapple with hyperinflation, high unemploymentparticularly among the youthcrippling infrastructure, and the lingering effects of prolonged international sanctions.\n\nYet, the president projected optimism, citing a projected 6% GDP growth this year, underpinned by multi-pronged policy reforms.\n\nKey to Zimbabwes vision, Mnangagwa said, is a modernised education sector geared towards innovation and technological advancement.\n\nHe urged African nations to explore new financing models and deepen regional trade ties.\n\nLet us not shy away from looking at new financing models and partnerships. The education sector should be the bedrock of innovation and science, he said, calling for bold policy frameworks and government procurement quotas to support youth-led startups.\n\nWomen and young people are central to Zimbabwes recovery blueprint.\n\nMechanisation programmes are driving agricultural productivity among youth, while youth- and women-led consortia are now active in infrastructure development across the country.\n\nMnangagwa also reaffirmed his governments commitment to honouring liberation war veterans with income-enhancing programmes and called for renewed focus on Pan-African economic cooperation.\n\nIn the true spirit of Pan-Africanism and regional integration, let us do more to promote trade among our countries.\n\nWhile critics argue more tangible reforms were needed to stem corruption and unlock foreign investment, Mnangagwas speech signalled a vision of empowerment rooted in grassroots resilience and continental unity.\n\n",
