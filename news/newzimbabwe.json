These are considered to be a type of option since they give a companys stockholders the right, but not the obligation, to purchase additional shares in the company.\n\nOK Zimbabwe is grappling with a mounting debt crisis of almost US$30 million accumulated over recent years.\n\nA detailed breakdown of the arrears shows the company owes US$24 million to suppliers, US$5.12 million in other payables such as utilities and service providers, and US$880,000 in statutory obligations.\n\nTo avert the crisis, the top retailer has since sacked its top management team, placed selected properties on sale and moved to float a Rights Offer.\n\nIn a latest announcement to shareholders this week, OK Zimbabwe company secretary, Margaret Munyuru said the offer was well subscribed with 100% uptake of the offer.\n\nTotal Rights Offer shares subscribed for 1 834 982 573 amount raised US$20 million 100% Rights Offer Shares. The Rights Offer was fully subscribed through a combination of shareholder take up underwriters in accordance with the underwriting agreement, she said.\n\nThe Board expressed its appreciation to shareholders for their continued support and to the underwriters for their commitment to the success of the capital raising exercise.\n\nProceeds from the Rights Offer will be applied towards partial settlement of legacy creditors, supporting the Companys working capital expenditure requirements and unlocking fresh supplier support.\n\nThe board also wishes to advise shareholders that the process relating to property disposal programme remains on-going.\n\nThe company are currently receiving and evaluating offers for the identified properties, with discussions under way to ensure that any transactions concluded are in the best interests of shareholders and are consistent with the companys strategic objectives, added Munyuru.\n\n",

The projected surplus will continue to be supported by improvements in merchandise exports and remittances, he said.\n\nThe MPS shows that the financial soundness metrics indicate that the banking sector is safe and sound despite some issues of prudential concern at a few institutions.\n\nAs at June 30, 2025, 17 out of 19 banking institutions reported core capital above the minimum regulatory capital requirements and the non-performing loans ratio stood at 2.89% compared to 3.37% as at 31 December 2024.\n\nOfficial records also show that during the same period, remittances rose to US$635,2 million signaling a 7,1% increase compared to the same period last year.\n\nTo year end, remittances are projected to increase by 4.9% from US$2.6 billion in 2024 to US$2.7 billion in 2025, sustaining a positive current account balance. Given the strategic importance of the diaspora community, the Government seeks to strengthen their role in the development of the country.\n\n",

The time to act is now, not later, he said.But in a statement, the ZCTU acting secretary general, Runesu Dzimiri said issuing such drastic measures move without an alternative is not favourable for the people of Zimbabwe, especially at a time when 88% of the population is working in the informal economy.He reminded the government that the chaos in the streets is a direct result of poor policies and weak governance systems, which have plunged the nation into chaos.The streets are congested with millions of graduates from tertiary institutions, because the economy has failed to create enough jobs to absorb job seekers owing to the collapse of the industry. Unemployment and the high cost of living are also factors forcing citizens into night vending.The National Development Strategy 1 had envisioned to create 760,000 jobs for the period 2020-2025 however, this has not been the case, he said.Dzimiri urged the government to accept the reality that even the smaller percentage currently employed is barely receiving a living wage and are now subsiding salaries with vending machines, making the trade the only option in the face of unsustainable unemployment levels.The ZCTU criticised the government for overseeing the construction of irrelevant workspaces across the country arguing that such initiatives lack the appreciation of how the informal sector works.We note and appreciate the establishment of vending stalls in places like Mbare and other sites as a great move. However, issues of accessibility to these sites are a barrier discouraging people to go and occupy those stalls, he said.He said going forward, Local authorities need to learn and apply the City of Mutare model which identified areas for night vending and established such places for licensed vendors in a move which has assisted in controlling waste disposal, poor sanitation and has also boosted revenues while for local enhancing service delivery.Dzimiri said the governments mantra of leaving no person and no place behind should encompass policy making processes.This ban will leave many unemployed and vulnerable women, youths and graduates roaming in the streets vending behind, suffering and continuously wallowing in poverty.The Vision 2030 of an upper middle class income economy needs strategic interventions to address the economic crisis, not these drastic, repulsive orders that will only cause chaos as police chase vendors without addressing the root causes of the challenges facing millions of Zimbabwe, he added.\n\nRecently, Local Government Minister, Daniel Garwe touched a raw nerve after issuing a directive to ban night vending.\n\nNight vending has brought with it illicit drug and substance dealings, which is a threat to health, economy and national security.The importation and selling of second-hand clothing is banned, and consequently street and night vending activities are equally banned.

According to the ministry, localised person-to-person transmission has been documented, often through household contact and healthcare-associated exposure, particularly in settings lacking appropriate protective measures.\n\nThe WHO is reporting ongoing outbreaks across Africa, including some Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries, raising fears of cross-border spread.\n\nThis poses a heightened risk of cross-border transmission, the ministry cautioned.\n\nIn response, Zimbabwe has scaled up disease surveillance and reinforced screening measures at all Points of Entry (PoEs).\n\nThe ministry urged the public to strictly follow WHO-recommended preventive measures, warning including avoiding physical contact with individuals showing symptoms of Mpox, sharing clothes, bedding and towels among other things.\n\nThe ministry also encouraged the public to be vigilant and act swiftly if they suspect infection. Members of the public are encouraged to report any suspected cases to the nearest health facility promptly, it said.\n\nMpox spreads primarily through close contact and can cause fever, rash, and swollen lymph nodes, sometimes leading to severe illness.\n\n",

            "content": "SundayWorld\n\nThe Pretoria High Court has delivered a historic ruling today, ordering the repatriation of former Zambian President Edgar Lungus body home for a state funeral, resolving a nearly two-month dispute that captivated the nation and resonated across southern Africa.\n\nLungu, who passed away on June 5 at Mediclinic Medforum in Pretoria during treatment for oesophageal cancer, will be laid to rest at Embassy Park in Lusaka with full military honours, as mandated by the court.\n\nThis is a matter of national dignity, said Acting Judge President Aubrey Ledwaba, delivering the ruling alongside a full bench. As a former head of state, President Lungus burial must reflect Zambias protocol and honour his service to the nation.\n\nThe decision followed a heated legal battle between the Zambian government, represented by Attorney General Mulilo Kabesha, and Lungus family, who insisted on a private burial in South Africa to honour the late Presidents alleged wish to exclude his political rival, President Hakainde Hichilema, from the proceedings.\n\nLungu, Zambias sixth president from 2015 to 2021, was a polarising figure whose death at age 68 sparked a controversy reflective of his contentious political career. His widow, Esther Lungu, and lawyer Makebi Zulu argued that Lungu had explicitly stated his wishes.\n\nMy husband was clear: he wanted President Hichilema nowhere near his funeral or his body, Esther Lungu stated in her affidavit.\n\nThe family cited past grievances, including the 2023 stripping of Lungus presidential benefits and alleged delays in approving his medical evacuation to South Africa, which they claim hastened his death.\n\nThe Zambian government, however, maintained that national law supersedes personal wishes. The burial of a former President is a state matter, as seen with President Kenneth Kaunda, Kabesha argued in court documents.\n\nThe government sought four key orders: a declaration of its exclusive right to repatriate Lungus body, the release of the body from a Pretoria funeral home to the Zambian High Commission, authorization for a state delegation to accompany the remains, and the exclusion of the familys authority over the burial process.\n\nThe court granted these requests but acknowledged the familys concerns. Judge Ledwaba noted: While we respect the familys sentiments, national protocol must prevail. We urge minimal involvement of President Hichilema to honour their wishes as far as possible.\n\nThe court dismissed an application by Zambian citizen Vincent Kafula to intervene. The applicant lacks the legal standing to influence this matter, said Ledwaba.\n\nKafula had warned that the dispute was tearing Zambia apart.\n\nThe court ordered Lungus body to be transported to Lusaka on a private chartered plane, where it will lie in state at his residence and a conference centre for public viewing before burial at Embassy Park.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nAT just 40 years of age, Rinos Mautsa has emerged as a shrewd businessman, overseeing multi-million-dollar enterprises within and outside the country.\n\nHaving shown early shoots of entrepreneurship at a young age, Mautsa has established several business ventures, such as the Contact Experience Association of Zimbabwe (CXAZ), formerly CCAZ, and PICCO Construction, among others.\n\nHis humble and calm demeanour belies the success and scale that his businesses have achieved over the years in Zimbabwes challenging economic environment.\n\nNewZimbabwe.com(NZ)caught up with Mautsa(RM), who described his journey and how his businesses have managed to stay afloat despite turbulence.\n\nNZ:Can you walk us through your professional background?\n\nRM: I have always been an entrepreneur at heart, inspired by my mother, whom I assisted in selling farm produce at a young age. While in college, I launched a movie business through a deal with my university, which ignited my passion for entrepreneurship.\n\nDuring my industrial work experience, I started a condiments buying and selling business that eventually grew to the point of exporting to Zambia. After college, I briefly worked at Telecel, TelOne, and Zuva Petroleum in various managerial roles.\n\nThe leaders at TelOne and Zuva greatly influenced my development as a manager and leader, and I am grateful for their mentorship. My wife, who is also my business partner, has played a significant role in my journey. I am a firm believer in God, and I recognise that I wouldnt be where I am today without His mercy.\n\nQN:Walk us through how you launched your businesses and what inspired the journey.\n\nRM:I started my first business while in college by seizing a unique opportunity to run a movie venture. This experience taught me the importance of innovation and calculated risks. On industrial attachment at Dairibord, I started buying and selling condiments from work and exporting to Zambia.\n\nMy condiments business later flourished, allowing me to reinvest and explore further opportunities in education and technology, which ultimately led me to energy and the construction and real estate sectors, where I recognised significant potential to do much more across Africa.\n\nQN: What has managed to sustain your firms in this difficult economic environment?\n\nRM:Our resilience is rooted in our commitment to quality and innovation. We embrace learning and quickly adapt to change. By identifying the critical need for housing and infrastructure in Zimbabwe, we have focused on developing clusters and high-rise flats that maximise space and align with market demands. This strategic focus has enabled us to thrive even in challenging economic conditions.\n\nQN: You have expanded outside of the country. How has that experience been, and how are the firms performing abroad?\n\nRM:Expanding beyond Zimbabwe has been a rewarding experience, allowing us to tap into new markets and diversify our portfolio. Our firms abroad are performing well as we adapt our strategies to local needs while maintaining the high standards weve established. The Chartered Institute of Customer Management is now operating in 13 countries across Africa.\n\nQN: Your portfolio spans construction (Picco), education, energy, and more. How do you identify opportunities across such diverse sectors, and whats your strategy for scaling them?\n\nRM:Identifying opportunities across diverse sectors requires a keen understanding of market dynamics and trends. My previous work experience informs many of my ventures.\n\nI focus on thorough research and analysis to pinpoint market gaps. My strategy for scaling involves building strong partnerships, nurturing relationships, leveraging technology, and maintaining a customer-centric approach to meet the evolving needs of our clients.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Labour Court has dismissed an appeal by Watershed College Trust against an arbitral award in favour of a former probationary teacher, ruling that the institution clearly aprobated and reprobated its contractual obligations and acted unlawfully by issuing notice of termination after the expiration of the probation period.\n\nIn a judgment delivered by Justice Samuel Kudya, the court found that while the arbitrator erred in concluding that the teacher, Jenipha Madziva, had become a permanent employee, the substantive award of damages for unfair dismissal remained valid.\n\nWatershed College Trust had challenged the arbitrators ruling on five grounds, including the claim that Madziva was erroneously classified as a permanent employee and that damages were improperly awarded in US dollars. However, Justice Kudya found that only one of the grounds had merit and upheld the rest of the arbitrators findings.\n\nThe employer clearly aprobated and reprobated by writing in the probation contract that it did not intend to extend it, yet it was doing exactly that which it said it did not intend to do, the judge ruled.\n\nThe dispute arose when the school employed Madziva on a fixed-term probation contract, which was due to expire on 31 March 2023.\n\nOn that very day, the school issued a notice stating it would not be extending her contract.\n\nThe arbitrator ruled that this amounted to unlawful termination and awarded damages, prompting the appeal.\n\nKudya criticised the colleges handling of the matter, stating, Had the employer indeed intended to give notice for the termination of the probation contract, it should have done so before its expiration.  It was not remiss for the arbitrator to conclude that once parties were in the April to December phase of the contract, they were now operating in the main contract.\n\nHe added that the colleges attempt to treat the contract as terminated while simultaneously letting it roll into the next phase of employment cannot pass the unreasonableness test laid out in Hama v NRZ.\n\nOn the matter of prejudice, the court noted that unfair dismissal need not be measured by harm suffered.\n\nPrejudice is indeed not a prerequisite to find unlawful termination, Kudya said, affirming the arbitrators position that the dismissal was inherently unfair.\n\nAddressing the employers objection to the damages awarded in US dollars, the court reaffirmed Zimbabwes multi-currency framework.\n\nThere was nothing remiss by making the order which the arbitrator made.  If the employer wants to pay what was ordered using the rate of the local currency at the date of payment, nothing stops it from doing so.\n\nThe judge further dismissed the employers contention that the arbitrator had wrongly quantified the damages.\n\nIt was unnecessary to try to find out what was due when it was apparent on the contract. The res ipsa loquitur principle applies.\n\nThe judge upheld the appeal relating to the employees classification as permanent.\n\nHe ruled that the arbitral award stands, but with the correction that Madziva was not a permanent employee.\n\nWatershed College Trust was ordered to pay costs on the ordinary scale.\n\n",
