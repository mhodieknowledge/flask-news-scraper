            "content": "By The Guardian\n\nMIGRANT workers who come to the UK to bolster the countrys care system are having to share beds, sleep rough, and are in some cases being charged more than 20,000 in illegal fees, according to research.\n\nA survey of more than 3,000 people who have travelled to the UK on health and care worker visas found that just under a quarter had paid fees to their employer or an intermediary upfront before coming to the UK, in return for the promise of a job.\n\nMore than 100 respondents, many of whom came to the UK from Nigeria, Zimbabwe, Zambia and other parts of Africa, as well as India, Pakistan, the Philippines, Brazil and Indonesia, paid between 5,000 and 20,000 in fees, and 50 over 10,000. Five paid 20,000 or more.\n\nDespite handing over such large sums, migrant care workers are often housed in overcrowded, substandard accommodation and face appalling levels of racism, the research shows.\n\nNearly a quarter of those in living in accommodation provided by their employer said they were obliged to share a bedroom with other workers.\n\nOne said 15 people were staying in a one-bedroom flat, and another was among nine sharing a three-bedroom property. Many struggle to afford to pay their rent and bills and two care workers said they had to sleep rough at times.\n\nWorkers from overseas are seen as vital resource for plugging recruitment gaps in the UKs creaking care system.\n\nSkills for Care estimates an average of 8.3% of social care roles in England were vacant in 2023/24, equivalent to approximately 131,000 vacancies. It also calculates that about one-third of new starters in the 2023/24 financial year were recruited internationally.\n\nThe survey by the trade union Unison also found widespread racism in the workplace. More than 800 people said they had experienced racism at work, with 355 reporting racism by their colleagues and nearly 300 by their boss.\n\nFear of reprisals prevents many migrant care staff from speaking out, according to the poll. More than a third of respondents said they or a migrant worker colleague had been threatened with dismissal or redundancy for raising issues about their treatment at work.\n\nCare companies employing overseas staff must assign a sponsorship certificate to every migrant worker they employ, which is used to apply for a visa. According to latest government figures, there were 21,300 applications for health and care visas between April and December 2024.\n\nBut if a staff member decided to leave, or if their company goes bust, they can be at risk of being deported if they cannot get a new sponsor within 60 days.\n\nChristina McAnea, Unisons general secretary, said: Care staff who come here from overseas are shoring up a crumbling sector. These workers should be treated with respect, not taken advantage of and abused. No one deserves to be treated in this despicable way.\n\nThe government must overhaul the sponsorship system as a matter of urgency. This would help prevent exploitation and drive up standards across the care sector.\n\nResponding to the findings, Dr Shabna Begum, chief executive of the Runnymede Trust, said: The racist treatment of migrant care workers, who are disproportionately people of colour, is symptomatic of the dreadful state of our broken care system.\n\nChronic under-investment in the care sector has created a situation where the people who we rely on to care for our elderly and vulnerable are exploited and brutalised on Dickensian terms, by both the system of recruitment and then the conditions in which they are expected to work.\n\nJamila Duncan-Bosu, a solicitor at the Anti Trafficking and Labour Exploitation Unit, a charity providing specialist legal support to survivors of trafficking and slavery, said: Exploitation is baked into the systems which the UK uses to recruit migrant workers. Workers who are tied to an employer and reliant on them for their ongoing visa status are far less able to escape exploitation.\n\nThe current system is a gift to those who seek to exploit migrant workers, as they can be certain that there will be little oversight or scrutiny of their actions.\n\nA government spokesperson said: We are deeply concerned about findings from this report, and stand firm on our zero-tolerance approach to labour exploitation and abuse of our immigration system by unscrupulous employers.\n\nThats why we have already set out first steps to ban rogue employers from sponsoring overseas workers, and will deliver legislation for the Fair Work Agency to ensure strong and fair employment rights for all.\n\nBusinesses found guilty of breaching employment law will have their sponsorship licenses refused or revoked, and care workers affected by this will be supported to find alternative employment.\n\n",

I am trying to focus on things which have consequences, said Mutsvangwa when questioned by the media.\n\nNational events have laid bare the fractures within the ruling party, with supporters displaying clear internal divisions. Recently two factions of ZANU PF supporters were heard chanting pro-Mnangagwa and another, pro-Chiwenga songs at Heroes Acre.\n\nAnother faction of war veterans, led by the outspoken Blessed Geza, has been calling for Mnangagwa to step aside, accusing him of overseeing a corrupt government.\n\nMnangagwas term ends in 2028, and he has stated that he will not run for another term, contrary to the sentiments of some of his supporters within ZANU PF.\n\nWithout mentioning names, Mutsvangwa suggested that Geza was being used to further a certain agenda within the party to unseat Mnangagwa.\n\nI have a lot of angst about the way he is being used by people who have a certain agenda. Comrade Geza, I do not know what other issues might be bothering you, but we, the war veterans, always remember I wish he would not follow fools who are misleading him. I am deeply concerned about what is happening with him, said Mutsvangwa.\n\nThe factional battles within ZANU PF are reminiscent of the internal politics that rocked the revolutionary party, resulting in the ousting of long-time ruler Robert Mugabe, who was replaced by Mnangagwa.\n\n",
