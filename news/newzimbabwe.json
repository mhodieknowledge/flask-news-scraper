However, Dstv did not air the episode in question; it was only aired on the Podcast and Chill channel on YouTube.\n\nDstvs digital distribution partner, Leading Edge Growth, confirmed toTimeslivethat Dstv has removed the popular podcast.\n\nLeading Edge Growth CEO Lufuno Maliavusa gave the confirmation that the show has been pulled.\n\nCiting To keep our content slate dynamic and engaging, we will continue to make adjustments to our roster. Notably, season one ofPodcast and Chilland season one ofAwkward Datesare nearing their final episodes in the coming weeks, making way for fresh and exciting content to take their place in these time slots.\n\nThis follows after MultiChoice refused to confirm the news of the shows cancellation. The Group only said it licensed a slate of podcasts from Leading Edge Growth, which was responsible for curating the podcast slate, taking into account audience dynamics and content demand.\n\nHowever, MacG is reportedlyunmoved by the news, as he is pursuing other endeavours.\n\nThe episode that spoke about Dlaminireceived attention from the Deputy Ministerof Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, Mmapaseka Steve Letsike.\n\nShe said MacGs comments were nauseating in their vulgarity and must be regarded as an unconstitutional violation of Dlaminis rights to freedom and security of the person, equality, and human dignity as enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.\n\nLetsike wanted MacG to be referred to the Parliaments Portfolio Committee, however,this was declined.\n\nI think the majority of members are not in favour of us proceeding as the honorable minister, deputy minister had requested us to do, the committees chairperson Liezl van der Merwe said.\n\nShe pointed out that Dlamini had not approached Parliament nor laid a criminal case.\n\nI think all of you have touched on this point that if we do decide it is our mandate to proceed with hearing one case of cyber-bullying, it would mean that this portfolio committee would have to extend that to every other person because they cannot be selective in choosing one case.\n\nMacG has since apologisedin one his episodes, saying he never intended to offend anyone.\n\nI want to apologise, first and foremost, to all the female chillers, and women in general in SA, I might have offended with that comment. That was not the intention. We never say things to offend people, he said.\n\nI want to extend an invite to Minnie Dlamini to the show. You are more than welcome to come.\n\nThis thing started on the podcastlets end it on the podcast. She said some things, I said some things. Lets squash it once and for all.\n\nDlamini saidshe was hurt and shocked by the commentsmade about her body and personal life on the podcast.\n\nOver the past few weeks, I have watched in disbelief and deep pain as my name, body, and dignity were dragged through the mud of public discourse, she said.\n\nShe described the remarks made by MacG as vile, humiliating, and inexcusable.\n\nDlamini said she is taking legal action to stand up for herself and the dignity of women.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nLISTED transport and logistics concern, Unifreight Africa Limited says the countrys tough economy added to high licensing fees is making operations very tough.\n\nIndustry has since raised similar concerns with the government over the years, now with several promises to deal with the problem being made. Several value chains in the economy are clogged with very costly, repetitive licensing fees, choking the ease of doing business.\n\nEchoing similar sentiments recently, Unifreights CEO, Richard Clarke, bemoaned the exorbitant licensing fees affecting transport sector players in the country.\n\nIn the transport sector specifically, operating costs in Zimbabwe are significantly higher than in neighbouring countries, which continues to squeeze margins. For example, fuel in Zimbabwe remains the most expensive in the region at around US$1,58 per litre, compared to about US$1,01 in Zambia. Vehicle registration and licensing fees are also exorbitantly high at roughly US$1,560 locally versus just US$132 in Zambia, he said.\n\nAdditionally, he said, diesel imports carry heavy duties (approx. USD 0.55 per litre)withexporters being forced to surrender 25% of foreign earnings for conversion into local currency (ZWG), which cannot be freely converted back to US$ at market rates.\n\nClarke said the combination of these challenges, added to currency volatility, liquidity constraints, inflationary pressures and a shortage of long-term financing in the local market, led many businesses to tighten their belts, creating a knock-on effect across supply chains.\n\nThe company said compounding cost pressures is the ongoing liquidity crunch in the banking sector prompting many financial institutions to pull back on lending, forcing companies, including Unifreight and our customers, to rely on shorter-term and more expensive financing.\n\nThese factors make operating a cross-border fleet out of Zimbabwe less attractive and more costly than regional competitors, Clarke said.\n\nMeanwhile, during the period, Unifreight Africa Limited delivered a strong start to 2025, with significant revenue growth in Q1.\n\nTotal revenues for the quarter surged by over 30% compared to the same period last year, reflecting robust demand and the success of recent strategic initiatives. Annual turnover rose from US$20.4 million in 2023 to US$24 million in 2024, and is forecast to reach US$32 million in 2025.\n\n",
