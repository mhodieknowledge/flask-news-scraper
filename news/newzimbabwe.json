            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal) to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans living in the diaspora. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. You spoke on sustainable infrastructure development at the CEOAfrica AnnualRoundtable in Victoria Falls. What is your position on sustainable infrastructure development in the African context, considering that Africa is a low global contributor to world pollution?\n\nVM: Thank you\n\nAs a point of correction, I spoke on legal considerations for unlocking finances for sustainable infrastructure development. My focus was really on the different mechanisms available to unlock finance for funding infrastructure projects in Zimbabwe, the continent and around the world.\n\nTo your question, sustainable development is a global reality despite various individual contrary views on whether it is necessary or fair. There is a plethora of legislation and policy entrenched in financing institutions that fund global development projects. They (the financial institutions) have, as a prerequisite, the condition that the projects be conscious of ESGs, being environmental, social impact and governance considerations.\n\nA debate on its necessity, especially as 54 separate African countries, is in my view, an uphill task and the logical thing will be for each to benefit from the funds available and develop the individual countries for the collective benefit\n\nReporter:Lets then start with the continental position. What legal and financial instruments are available for infrastructure development that is sustainable?\n\nVM: We have a number of funds that promote infrastructure development that are premised on sustainability by taking into consideration the environment and social impacts. An example will be Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA), Green Climate Fund and even the African Development Bank also prescribes infrastructure projects to establish sustainability.\n\nThis is not just a continental requirement, even when unlocking global international finance, institutions are guided by the Equator Principles and International Finance Corporation performance standards, which have at their core, requirements for the financing institution to satisfy itself that the projects being funded are environmentally sustainable.\n\nIf we were to also look East, being global financial giants, China in 2021 also implemented the Green Development Guidelines for Overseas Investment and Cooperation and is also considering sustainability in its funding mechanisms.\n\nTo the second part of your question on sustainable infrastructure development, on the continent, we are guided by the African Union Agenda 2063 being a blueprint of Africas structural transformation.\n\nFurther, we also have the Programme for Infrastructure Development (PIDA) with a priority action plan or mandate to give preference to cross-border projects in energy, water and transport, among other things. These projects, as you can see at face value, have serious environmental and social considerations.\n\nThen there is the African Free Trade Organisation, which makes sustainable infrastructure a treaty-based obligation. The harmonisation of the continental laws and individual state laws is now a legal and economic necessity.\n\nReporter: Before discussing what the position in Zimbabwe is, what are the things investors generally consider when investing in infrastructure development?\n\nVM: Well like in every investment transaction, the investor is concerned mainly with whether he or she will attain enforceable rights, whether or not there are predictable timelines within the project and key to all, whether the project has taken into consideration and mitigated against any potential environmental and social impact, allowing maximum protection to the potentially affected.\n\nReporter: What is then our Zimbabwe position in terms of sustainable infrastructure development?\n\nVM: I will reiterate what I said at the CEO roundtable conference, my view is that our laws in terms of sustainable infrastructure development are well developed and competitive on the continent.\n\nSustainability is a constitutional, legislative and policy question in Zimbabwe as it is covered by all pillars of the prescriptive and guidance laws in our country.\n\nOur weakness is that the laws are fragmented and found in various statutes that address the different areas where sustainability is a question. Although the Environmental Management Act is the overarching legislation, aligning with the prescriptive terms of our constitution, other legislation like your Water Act, Electricity Act, ZIDA and many other have sustainability considerations.\n\nThe National Development Strategy 2, commencing in 2026, has put sustainable development goals at the core of its policy.\n\nCountries like Kenya have managed to amalgamate these laws into a single reference legislation, making them more attractive to sustainable infrastructure development financing. Although we have a National Climate Policy, our National Climate Management Bill, which will harmonise these laws, is going through the legislative processes with the objective of having a national reference point.\n\nReporter: Would you then advise that ESGs be part of all sustainable infrastructure development plans for investors? If yes, what would your reasons be?\n\nVM: With the risk of sounding like a broken record, international finance can mostly be accessed by companies that can show project environmental and social impacts, including mitigation and remediation options.\n\nIt therefore widens the areas where the developer can access development finance.\n\nInclusion of ESG considerations future proofs projects because most African countries, with Zimbabwe included, are incorporating or perfecting the laws that deal with climate issues.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr Madzima. We have to end here because of our time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

The road to recovery was far from easy, marked by surgery, 40 sessions of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, uncertainty and moments that tested her strength.\n\nYet, through it all, the 30-year-old accountant remained steadfast and determined, drawing on her faith, her support system, and her deep inner resolve.\n\nMarlene undergoing cancer treatment\n\nBy 2020, Marlene had entered remission, emerging from her treatment with renewed gratitude for life and an unshakable sense of purpose. Now, five years in remission, though not yet officially declared cancer-free, she continues to live with courage and conviction. It is a daily reminder that healing is both a physical and spiritual journey.\n\nChoosing not to keep her story private, Marlene uses her voice to inspire others and advocate for cancer awareness, encouraging early screening, open conversations about health, and emotional support for those facing similar struggles.\n\nMarlene uses her voice to inspire others and advocate for cancer awareness\n\nHer message is simple yet profoundly powerful: Cancer is not the end. With courage, treatment, and support, there is life beyond diagnosis.\n\nProfessionally, Marlene is a force of determination and excellence. She holds a bachelors degree in accountancy (BAcc), a Master of Science in Management and Finance, and an MBA, academic achievements that mirror her commitment to growth, integrity, and leadership. Her career has spanned several significant roles, including with the Footballers Union of Zimbabwe and Education Matters Africa, before taking on her current position as CEO of the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee.\n\nIn her role at ZOC, Marlene continues to lead with vision, empathy, and integrity, championing initiatives that empower athletes and promote inclusivity, sustainability, and good governance in sport. Her leadership is shaped not only by her professional expertise but also by the compassion and resilience honed through her personal journey of survival.\n\nMarlene celebrated her victory over cancer in 2020, a joyful moment that embodies her strength and resilience.\n\nMarlenes story is more than one of professional success. It is a living testament to faith, perseverance, and the unbreakable power of the human spirit.\n\nThrough her life and work, she reminds us of all that even in the face of adversity, strength and purpose can prevail. She reminds us that surviving cancer can mark the beginning of a renewed mission to live boldly and lead with heart.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTigere Property Fund (Tigere REIT) has announced plans to expand its portfolio through the acquisition of two prime retail properties, the Greenfields Retail Centre and Phase 1 of the Zimre Park Retail Centre, for a combined value of approximately US$25.1 million.\n\nThe REIT said the proposed acquisitions are subject to unitholder approval and will be fully funded through the issuance of 770.5 million new Tigere REIT units.\n\nThis marks Tigere REITs second acquisition since its initial public offering (IPO), following the successful purchase of Highland Park Phase 2. The move aligns with the funds strategy of securing high-quality, income-generating real estate assets supported by long-term, US dollar-denominated leases, a key driver for stable returns and capital growth.\n\nThe total acquisition consideration reflects the combined net asset value (NAV) of the target properties. Upon completion, Tigere REITs total units in issue will increase to 1.84 billion, with the newly issued units representing 41.8% of the enlarged unit base.\n\nThe implied issuance price per unit for the transaction stands at US$3.26 cents, representing a 2.536% premium over Tigere REITs NAV per unit of US$3.18 as of June 30, 2025.\n\nThe bulk of the transaction involves the Greenfields Retail Centre, acquired on a leasehold basis. The property, whose development began in December 2024, features 54 tenants across 14,000m of gross lettable area (GLA) and is currently fully occupied.\n\nTigere REIT said the acquisitions will further strengthen its portfolio of high-quality retail assets, supporting consistent returns and sustainable long-term growth for investors.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nLimpopo Premier Dr Phophi Ramathuba has describedthe deadly N1 bus crash that claimed 43 livesas a preventable disaster and an act of criminal negligence, following revelations that the vehicle was overloaded, unroadworthy and speeding when it plunged down a steep embankment near Louis Trichardt last week.\n\nOn Monday, Ramathuba met with the families and relatives of the deceased at Siloam Hospital in the Vhembe District, where she extended her condolences and expressed solidarity with those mourning the loss of their loved ones. Addressing the gathering, she said the tragedy was not an unavoidable act of fate but the result of lawlessness and greed within the cross-border transport industry.\n\nThe victims  mostly Zimbabwean and Malawian nationals  were travelling home when the bus veered off the N1 North near Louis Trichardt on 13 October, killing 43 passengers and injuring 40 others.\n\nAccording to a technical report by the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC), the bus was operating without meeting roadworthiness standards, carried passengers beyond its legal limit and was travelling at an unsafe speed along a mountainous route. Ramathuba said such conditions made the tragedy not just an accident, but a crime against humanity.\n\nThe government will not allow lives to be lost due to greed, lawlessness and disregard for human life, she said. We condemn reckless driving, non-compliance with transport regulations, and the operation of unroadworthy vehicles. The law must take its course, and those responsible must be held accountable.\n\nLimpopo Premier Dr Phophi Ramathuba\n\nRamathuba also commended the emergency services and hospital staff who responded to the scene, saying their swift action saved lives under difficult and dangerous conditions. Our rescue teams risked their own lives to retrieve bodies and transport survivors to safety. Their commitment gave dignity to the deceased and comfort to the grieving, she said.\n\nThe Limpopo government has partnered with the diplomatic missions of Zimbabwe and Malawi to identify and repatriate the deceased. Forensic teams have completed postmortem examinations and begun DNA testing to ensure accurate identification of remains.\n\nFamilies of the victims were provided with counselling and logistical support as they began the painful process of identifying their loved ones.\n\nThe tragedy has reignited concerns over South Africas road safety record and the persistent operation of unsafe, overloaded cross-border buses. Transport experts and activists have long warned that weak enforcement and corruption in vehicle inspections allow dangerous operators to remain on the road, turning long-distance routes into death corridors.\n\nFor many families, the loss goes beyond the immediate grief  it also means the loss of breadwinners who had been working in South Africa to support relatives in neighbouring countries.\n\nEvery life lost on our roads is a blow to a family, a community, and to our shared humanity, Ramathuba said.\n\nAs the province continues to assist with repatriations and investigations, the premier urged all road users to prioritise safety and accountability.\n\nLife has no duplicate, she said.\n\nEvery journey must begin with responsibility. Let us not wait for another disaster to remind us of the value of a single human life.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nNicolas Sarkozy has become the first French ex-president to go to jail, as he starts a five-year sentence for conspiring to fund his election campaign with money from late Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi.\n\nNot since World War Two Nazi collaborationist leader Philippe Ptain was jailed for treason in 1945 has any French ex-leader gone behind bars.\n\nSarkozy, who was president from 2007-2012, has appealed against his jail term at La Sant prison, where he will occupy a small cell in the its isolation wing.\n\nMore than 100 people applauded and shouted Nicolas! as he left his villa in the exclusive 16th district of Paris, holding his wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy by the hand.\n\nHis son Louis, 28, had appealed to supporters for a show of support, while another son, Pierre, called for a message of love  nothing else, please.\n\nNicolas Sarkozy, 70, was driven through the entrance of the notoriously overcrowded 19th-Century prison in the Montparnasse district south of the River Seine at 09:40 local time (07:40 GMT), while dozens of police officers cordoned off most of the surrounding streets.\n\nHe continues to protest his innocence in the highly controversial Libyan money affair and posted a message on X as he was driven to the jail, saying: I have no doubt. Truth will prevail. But how crushing the price will have been.\n\nWith unwavering strength I tell [the French people] it is not a former president they are locking up this morning  it is an innocent man, he wrote. Do not feel sorry for me because my wife and my children are by my side but this morning I feel deep sorrow for a France humiliated by a will for revenge.\n\nMoments after Sarkozy entered jail, his lawyer Christophe Ingrain said a request for his release had been filed. Nothing justified his imprisonment, said Mr Ingrain, adding: Hell be inside for at least three weeks or a month.\n\nSarkozy has said he wants no special treatment at La Sant prison, although he has been put in its isolation section for his own safety as other inmates are infamous drugs dealers or have been convicted for terror offences.\n\nSarkozys cell in the prisons isolation wing is believed to be on the top floor and will measure between 9-11 sq m (95-120 sq ft). There had earlier been talk of him serving his term in the another wing for vulnerable people, where other VIPs have been jailed in the past.\n\nHe will have a toilet, a shower, a desk, a small electric hob and a small TV, for which he will have to pay a monthly 14 (12) fee, and the right to a small fridge.\n\nThe former president has the right to receive information from the outside world and family visits as well as written and phone contact.\n\nBut he is in effect in solitary confinement, allowed just one hour a day for exercise, by himself in the wings segregated courtyard.\n\nConditions of detention in an isolation wing are pretty hard, La Sant ex-deputy head Flavie Rault told BFMTV. You are alone, all the time. The only contact you have is with prison staff. You never come across another detainee for security reasons and theres a type of social isolation which makes life difficult.\n\nAt the end of last week, Sarkozy was received at the lyse Palace by President Emmanuel Macron, who told reporters on Monday it was normal that on a human level I should receive one of my predecessors in that context.\n\nMacron stressed on Tuesday that it was not his role to comment on or criticise judicial decisions, but he said it was normal that for many in France the sight of a president jailed by this judicial decision would provoke comment.\n\nIn a further measure of official support for the ex-president, Justice Minister Grald Darmanin said he would go to visit him in prison as part of his role in ensuring Sarkozys safety and the proper functioning of the jail.\n\nI cannot be insensitive to a mans distress, he added.\n\nEver since he left office in 2012, Sarkozy has been dogged by criminal inquiries and for months had to wear an electronic tag around his ankle after a conviction last December for trying to bribe a magistrate for confidential information about a separate case.\n\nLate next month, Frances highest administrative court will give its verdict on Sarkozys appeal against a six-month jail term in another illegal campaign financing case known as the Bygmalion affair.\n\nAhead of his arrival at La Sant prison, Sarkozy gave a series of media interviews, telling La Tribune: Im not afraid of prison. Ill keep my head held high, including at the prison gates.\n\nSarkozy has always denied doing anything wrong in a case involving allegations that his 2007 presidential campaign was funded by millions of euros in Libyan cash.\n\nThe former centre-right leader was cleared of personally receiving the money but convicted of criminal association with two close aides, Brice Hortefeux and Claude Guant, for their role in secret campaign financing from the Libyans.\n\nThe two men both had talks with Gaddafis intelligence chief and brother-in-law in 2005, a meeting arranged by a Franco-Lebanese intermediary called Ziad Tiakeddine, who died in Lebanon shortly before Sarkozys conviction.\n\nAs he lodged an appeal, Sarkozy is still considered innocent but he has been told he must go to jail in view of the exceptional seriousness of the facts.\n\nSarkozy said he would take two books with him into prison, a life of Jesus by Jean-Christian Petitfils and the Count of Monte Cristo, Alexandre Dumass classic story of a man wrongly imprisoned who escapes to wreak vengeance on his prosecutors.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nOutspoken former Zanu PF Central Committee member Temba Mliswa has launched a blistering attack on Presidential Spokesperson George Charamba, accusing him of sabotaging President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nMliswa claimed Charamba should be investigated, alleging that his lackadaisical response to rising criticism of Mnangagwa over controversial calls for a 2030 term extension amounted to deliberate sabotage.\n\nZanu PF is currently engulfed in succession battles, with some of Mnangagwas loyalists pushing for him to remain in power until 2030 despite the two-term constitutional limit, which requires him to step down when his second and final term ends in 2028.\n\nMnangagwas deputy, Rtd Constantino Chiwenga, is widely expected to succeed him. He, however, faces stiff resistance from a faction of Mnangagwa allies, some of whom Chiwenga has accused of corruption.\n\nTensions have intensified following reports that Chiwenga presented a corruption dossier to the Politburo naming businessmen Delish Nguwaya, Wicknell Chivayo, Paul Tungwarara, Kudakwashe Tagwirei, and Pedzai Sakupwanya, all reportedly close to Mnangagwa.\n\nZanu PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa last weekaccused Chiwenga of turning the presidium into a kangaroo court after the VP questioned whyMnangagwa had not taken actionagainst the named individuals.\n\nAmid the internal chaos, Mliswa accused Charamba of failing to defend Mnangagwa.\n\nHis latest conduct, as a Presidential Spokesperson, when the President came under siege has been very telling and speaks of a compromised character. His lackadaisical approach is not just absence of passion and initiative but a wilful removal of those factors to sabotage the President. One has to learn to serve one master faithfully and not be preoccupied with surviving to serve in every administration that comes in, Mliswa wrote on X.\n\nHe further argued that self-exiled former minister Jonathan Moyo was doing a better job defending Mnangagwa from abroad.\n\nHow does one act normal and even peddle the mirage of normalcy in a situation which everyone can see is a President facing internal attacks? As it is, Prof Moyo is actually doing a better job from a propaganda perspective advancing the Presidential cause more effectively.\n\nMliswa also took aim at Information Ministry Permanent Secretary Nick Mangwana, accusing him of weakness during a politically volatile moment.\n\nThe situation hasnt been helped by Nick Mangwanas own weak approach in a volatile environment. In a scenario where rivals have defrocked themselves of diplomacy, humility and etiquette in relation to the President, why does the Presidents own defence retain false humility and continue delicately tiptoeing around? he added.\n\nCharamba, however, hit back, using his pseudonymous X account @Jamwanda2, dismissing Mliswa as a failed opposition figure seeking relevance.\n\nI HARDLY HAVE TIME FOR A FAILED OPPOSITION FIGURE WHO SEEKS TO PLAY SAVIOUR TO MY PRINCIPAL OR TO ZANU PF WHICH HE IS YET TO RE-JOIN. I WILL ONLY TAKE NOTICE OF HIS ERRANT VIEWS WHEN HE BECOMES A MEMBER OF ZANU PF, OR AN MP AFTER WINNING A SEAT IN A FREE AND FAIR ELECTORAL CONTEST. FOR NOW HE IS A MERE TALKATIVE NOBODY WHO HAS NO LESSONS FOR ME! YOU CAN ADVISE HIM TO GO HANG ON A BANANA TREE IF HE HAS ANY, OR RUNS AN ORCHARD!!! Charamba wrote.\n\nMliswa, who has also attacked Chiwenga in recent weeks, claimed the Vice President lacks the political strategy to succeed Mnangagwa and alleged that he too benefitted from corrupt networks.\n\nHe alleged that at one point, Chiwengas honeymoon expenses were paid for by Chivayo.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Constitutional Court has struck down the University of Zimbabwes (UZ) appeal in a long-running labour dispute with former bursar Vengai Mugabe, declaring prior court proceedings a nullity in every sense.\n\nDelivering the judgment, Justice Anne-Mary Gowora ruled that both the Labour Court and the Supreme Court acted without proper jurisdiction.\n\nIt has been made clear that there must be compliance with statutory requirements in order for the court to assert jurisdiction over matters, she said. The lack of adherence to these procedural safeguards rendered the previous judgments ineffective and void.\n\nMugabe, appointed bursar on a fixed-term contract from July 2017 to June 2021, was dismissed following clashes with university management. A labour officer later awarded him US$323,036 for unfair dismissal, a ruling UZ unsuccessfully appealed.\n\nRepresenting Mugabe, attorney Tawanda Zhuwarara said the earlier rulings violated fundamental rights enshrined in sections 56 and 71 of the Constitution, adding that the Supreme Courts decision was an arbitrary deprivation of property.\n\nUZs lawyer, G. Madzoka, countered that the application was nothing more than a disguised appeal, arguing that the underlying issues had already been settled.\n\nJustice Rita Makarau noted the unacceptable failure by lower courts to address preliminary points vital to fairness.\n\nDeclaring both earlier rulings void, the Court found the proceedings fraught with irregularities.\n\n",
