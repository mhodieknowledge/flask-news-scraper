A thick edge proved the undoing of the Zimbabwean as wicketkeeper Lorcan Tucker reacted sharply to make the catch.\n\nMadhevere then combined with Campbell to add 56 for the sixth wicket before the stand-in captain drove a full toss firmly back at Humphreys, who reacted quickly by sticking out his left hand and clinging on to the catch.\n\nMadhevere, who only came into the team shortly before the match began when captain Craig Ervine withdrew for the birth of his child, played an assured innings striking seven fours in his undefeated 61 which came from 147 deliveries.\n\nIt was a pleasing change of fortunes for the 25-year-old, who has scored 87 runs in this match after ducks in his three previous Test innings.\n\nAfter the Bulawayo Test, the teams travel north to Harare for three ODIs and three T20Is.\n\n",

Look closer, and you will realise those are two different people. America is exposing us to its stupidity. I dont care about your sanctions; I will never stop fighting for black people to be equal to white people, and if that makes me an international criminal, I am proud to be one.\n\nTrump, Musk turn heat on SA\n\nMusk and US president Donald Trump have intensified tensions against South Africa in recent weeks after President Cyril Ramaphosa signed into the law the Expropriation Act.\n\nOn Friday, Trump announced that he had signed executive orders which would see USAID no longer funding any HIV/Aids programmes in South Africa and that white Afrikaners would be given priority status for the US refugee programme.\n\nThe EFF has called for the Ramaphosa government to strengthen ties with Brics partners amid the aggression from the US, saying the Trump administration was punishing Pretoria for backing the people of Palestine after South Africa took Israel to the International Court of Justice.\n\nIn a statement, EFF spokesperson Sinawo Thambo said they were not concerned by the comments by Musk.\n\nAs part of the general hysteria that has overtaken governance in the USA, Musk has assumed the role of a global billionaire maniac, whose grotesque wealth has overwhelmed him and made him think of himself as a supreme ruler of not only the Oval Office, but of all nations of the world, he said.\n\nThe EFF takes this opportunity to tell Elon Musk and all of his allies, in the USA, in Israel and the right wing groups in South Africa which have mobilized Musk, to collectively go to hell.\n\nThe principle remains that equality in South Africa is rooted in the return of the land to African people, and this will be achieved through expropriation without compensation, said Thambo.\n\nNo Starlink favours for Musk in SA\n\nThe EFF said it was also making a firm commitment that Musks Starlink will never operate in South Africa without complying to local legislation which demands that there must be 30% local ownership.\n\nThe offense that Musk has made against the leader of the EFF constitutes a meddling in our domestic affairs which we do not take lightly, and he must be viewed as an imperialist who seeks to undermine the economic and political sovereignty of South Africa through sanctions, and is part of mischievous attempts to severe relations between South Africa and the US.\n\nThe EFF declare Elon Musk as an enemy of South Africa, and a capturer of governance in the USA who will lead to that nations downfall.\n\nAll progressive nations, including Russia, China, India, and all African states ought to isolate and reject all enterprises pursued by Elon Musk in their nations.\n\nElon Musk has captured the Presidency of the USA and has weaponized his office as an instrument to pursue his business interests globally.\n\nHis nefarious influence must be opposed and undermined by all nations which respect their sovereignty and seek to maintain independence.\n\nThe EFF will not be cowed into submission, retreat nor capitulation from its principled and unwavering commitment to confront imperialism and its surrogates like Elon Musk anywhere and everywhere it rises its ugly head, said Thambo.\n\nAs tensions between Washington and Pretoria spill over, Afriforum announced at the weekend that they would not be taking up Trumps offer for refuge in the US.\n\nAfriforum is seeking an audience with Ramaphosa to resolve the current impasse over the Expropriation Act and other policies, including the Basic Education Laws Amendment Act.\n\n",

South Africa has been punished not for doing anything against any country, but doing what they think is best for themselves. That was the case with Zimbabwe.\n\nSouth Africa says Trumps move is based on fake news.\n\nWe are concerned by what seems to be a campaign of misinformation and propaganda aimed at misrepresenting our great nation. It is disappointing to observe that such narratives seem to have found favour among decision-makers in the United States of America, said Ronald Lamola, South Africas Minister for International Relations.\n\nTrumps order says South Africas Land Expropriation Act is evidence of policies that allegedly discriminate against white farmers. However, the Act allows land to be taken without compensation only in specific circumstancessuch as when land has been left idle or poses a risk to the public.\n\n",

            "content": "By Political Correspondent\n\nAS Zimbabweans grapple with economic hardships, skyrocketing inflation, and a deteriorating healthcare system, Zanu PF is once again prioritising its grip on power over the welfare of the people.\n\nThe ruling partys latest schemea blatant push to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas term beyond the constitutional limitexposes its disregard for democracy and the will of the people. Zimbabwes Constitution is clear: a president can serve a maximum of two terms.\n\nMnangagwas second and final term is set to end in 2028, yet Zanu PF is maneuvering to rewrite the rules to keep him in power.\n\nThis follows the partys well-documented history of amending laws to benefit the ruling elite while ignoring the countrys pressing crises.\n\nWhat makes this move even more alarming is how its being facilitatednot through democratic consultation but through a calculated campaign of patronage.\n\nInstead of focusing on governance, Zanu PF is splashing millions to buy loyalty, especially among influential figures in society. The rogue regime has put aside US$93 for a clampdown campaign targeting all Chamisa sympathisers across Zimbabwe. Reports are emerging of prominent social, political, and business figures receiving large sums of money and gifts from Zanu PF in a bid to secure their support for Mnangagwas extended rule.\n\nThis is not governance; it is bribery disguised as politics said Genius Mamwadhu of the Chamisa faction.The tactic is clear: silence potential opposition, manufacture consent, and create an illusion of popular support.\n\nInstead of investing in essential services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure, Zanu PFs priority is to enrich those who can help extend Mnangagwas rule.\n\nAll the forces against the 2030 move are now targeted for persecution. It is rumoured Mnangagwas henchmen will invoke the Patriotic Act on people in the diaspora the likes of Mellisa Mbavarira, Chipo Komboni, Tendai Christian Mapfumo, Mashama Petronella Mazise, Tatenda Alexias Chifamba, Memory Kishindo, Rudo Yvonne Dodzo, Brian Chikukwa, Petty Ziramba and Donovan Tendekai Dube. Other are Greatman Makipa, Sibongile Kadzima, Boniface Munyaradzi Zengeni, Shepherd Yuda, Pamela Magwizi, Nastancia Darabani and Nobubhukosi Ncube, who have started a movement called NO to 2030.\n\nThe above-mentioned group is planning petitions and advocating for isolation of Zimbabwe in international trade and borrowing. They point out that how can a government splash billions of pounds in vote buying.\n\nZimbabwes history is littered with examples of how power-hungry leaders have manipulated the system to remain in control. This latest attempt is no different. It not only undermines democracy but also signals that Zimbabwes leadership is more concerned with its survival than with addressing the peoples struggles.\n\nFor a country already suffering from high unemployment, failing public services, and widespread corruption, shops are closing and business moving out of the country. This move only deepens the crisis.\n\nEvery dollar spent on securing Mnangagwas third term is a dollar stolen from essential public services.\n\nThe Zimbabwean people have seen this playbook before, but history has also shown that no dictatorship lasts forever. The power of the people is greater than those in powerwhen they rise, no amount of money can suppress their will.\n\nZanu PFs attempts to entrench Mnangagwa beyond his constitutional limit must be resisted. Zimbabweans must reject the culture of patronage and demand leaders who serve the people, not themselves.\n\nIn the words of Victor Muchavhaira, a member of the opposition Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) security department, The Constitution exists to protect democracy, and no amount of money should be allowed to buy its destruction.\n\nMuchavairas opinion resonates with that of Sikhatalele Dladla, a Zimbabwean diasporan resident in Ireland who says, The future of Zimbabwe belongs to its people, not to those who seek to hold it hostage for personal gain.\n\n",

It was a firefight.\n\nThe bout had been elevated to an IBF world title eliminator earlier in the week, with Chisora now in line to face either champion Daniel Dubois or Joseph Parker, who meet on 22 February.\n\nFormer four-weight world champion Roberto Duran, WBA featherweight champion Nick Ball, who faces TJ Doheny on 15 March, Joe Joyce and Dillian Whyte were among those in attendance for Chisoras UK send-off.\n\nThe 41-year-old was joined in the ring by UK rappers Skepta, Tinie Tempah and Chipmunk after his victory was announced as he asked fans to vote on who his opponent should be for his 50th fight.\n\nChisora intends to retire after that fight, which he wants to take place overseas.\n\nLegacy isnt made by me  it is made by the fans, Chisora added.\n\nChisora spoke in the build-up to his UK send-off about it being an emotional week and those feelings got the better of him when he entered the venue earlier in the night, with the TNT broadcast showing him in tears.\n\nBy the time he made his walk to the ring wearing a cowboy hat, Chisora had steadied himself mentally and he was warmly welcomed into the arena as fans sang along to Hotel California.\n\nDel Boy set the tempo from the outset, fighting on the front foot and not allowing Wallin space to get behind his jab.\n\nShort bursts to body and head were enough to carry Chisora through the early stages and a looping right had Wallin backtracking in round three.\n\nChisora was cut above his right eye in round five but passed a check with the doctor in the sixth as he continued to enjoy the better of the close exchanges.\n\nA looping right sent Wallin tumbling across the ring and down in the ninth but he was back ready to go by the count of eight.\n\nUpon hearing the 10-second clapper in the final round, Chisora threw everything at Wallin and put down his rival, who was saved by the bell.\n\nChisora has faced some of the biggest names in the sport during his 18-year career, meeting Tyson Fury on three occasions, Whyte and Parker twice, and has also come up short against Vitali Klitschko and Oleksandr Usyk.\n\nIt is Chisoras third win in succession after victories over Gerald Washington and Joe Joyce.\n\nChisora is the third man to beat Wallin following losses against Fury and Anthony Joshua.\n\nJust seven of Chisoras 49 professional bouts have taken place outside of the UK and this was his fourth contest in Manchester.\n\nHis three previous fights in Manchester  two against Parker and one with Whyte  ended in defeat.\n\nChisora wants to end on a high\n\nChisora was clear that he wanted one more fight after facing Wallin and the news that this bout had been upgraded to an IBF eliminator put even more on the line for the veteran.\n\nThe Zimbabwe-born Londoner first fought for a world title in 2012 when he lost against WBC heavyweight champion Klitschko and he also came up short against Fury in 2022 with the WBC belt on the line.\n\nA third shot at gold could be on the horizon for Chisora after he rolled back the years to dispatch Wallin.\n\nChisora urged the fans to help him pick his next opponent, with WBA (Super), WBC and WBO champion Usyk and former two-time heavyweight champion Joshua also in his sights.\n\n",

Its like Zanu PF seeking police clearance to hold its Politburo meetings, he said.\n\nThe law only talks of holding public meetings, processions or demonstrations in public places. The meeting we held was in a bush at Beats of Forest and wondered how it turned out to be a public place.\n\nSecondly, they are mistaking the National Democratic Working Group (NDWG), to be a political party which it is not, he said.\n\nSikhala narrated episodic visits to their meeting by police officers and those from the Presidents Office before being raided and heavily assaulted, including one unnamed officer, who reportedly pointed a gun at top official Wurayi Zembe.\n\nInitially, a Toyota Hilux double cab with dark windows arrived with 5 members of the CIO led by Muvhangeri, whose home area is Buhera. They arrived and parked at the premises and engaged with the NDWG Chief National Organiser Democrat Engineer Joelson Mugari.\n\nAfter about 5 minutes they left. A few minutes later, another vehicle, a Toyota Hilux without number plates arrived with members of the Police Intelligence (PI) formerly PISI & members of the CID Law and Order led by Ngweme.\n\nAccording to Sikhala, his group, through one Engineer Joelson Mugari, engaged the police in vain.\n\nWhile he was engaging them, 3 truckloads of riot Police and AK47 wielding police officers descended on the venue led by a plain clothed officer called Shonhiwa.\n\nThe other AK47-wielding police officer pointed his gun at Dr. Zembe screaming I am going to shoot you. Dr Zembe remained calm and watched the drama. This happened right next to me, he said.\n\nSikhala further complained of being commandeered into waiting pick-up trucks during heavy and torrential rains.\n\nRains pounded on us from Beats of Forest to Penhalonga Police Station around 12 noon. We all got so wet that we looked like drowned rats when we finally arrived at Penhalonga Police Station which was a distance away.\n\nAll our phones were switched off and we were asked to sit down on some dirty floor. Recording of each individuals details took about 3 hours. We were suddenly told that we are no longer handling your case and you must be taken to Mutare Central CID Law and Order.\n\nAt the CID Law and Order we were not asked to plead to any charge but they took Engineer Joelson Mugari, Dr. Wurayayi Zembe, Nyabeze and myself for interviews.\n\nSikhalas group arrest rekindles memories of the arrest of Senator Jameson Timba and other 78 Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) activists. These were arrested in June last year for gathering to commemorate the Day of the African Child, which the police said was illegal. They spent six months behind bars before being released.\n\n",

            "content": "By Reuters\n\nWINDHOEK Sam Nujoma, the activist and guerrilla leader who became Namibias first democratically elected president after it won its independence from apartheid South Africa, died aged 95 on Saturday, the Namibian Presidency said on Sunday.\n\nNujoma rose to head the thinly populated southern African country on March 21, 1990 and was formally recognised as Founding Father of the Namibian Nation through a 2005 Act of Parliament.\n\nThe acclaim was balanced out by domestic and international criticism over his intolerance of critical media coverage, his railing against homosexuality and over the 1998 constitutional amendment that let him run for a third term.\n\nHe was a longtime ally of Zimbabwean strongman Robert Mugabe, backing Mugabes land seizures from white farmers, though at home Nujoma stuck to a willing buyer, willing seller policy.\n\nThe foundations of the Republic of Namibia have been shaken, the presidency posted on X.\n\nOur venerable leader, Dr. Nujoma did not only blaze the trail to freedom  but he also inspired us to rise to our feet and to become masters of this vast land of our ancestors.\n\nThe presidency said Nujoma had been hospitalised for medical treatment over the past three weeks, adding: Unfortunately, this time, the most gallant son of our land could not recover from his illness.\n\nCOMPLEX LEGACY\n\nNujoma served his three terms as president from 1990 to 2005 and sought to project himself as a unifying leader bridging political divides.\n\nIn a country scarred by the legacy of apartheid and German colonial rule, Nujomas SWAPO party oversaw a national reconciliation programme under the motto One Namibia, One Nation.\n\nIn his speeches, Nujoma made a point of repeating the phrase: A united people, striving to achieve a common good for all members of the society, will always emerge victorious.\n\nHis achievements included establishing democratic institutions and prioritising reconciliation, said Ndumba Kamwanyah, a lecturer at the University of Namibia and a political analyst.\n\nBut his autocratic tendencies, on display in his treatment of the media and brutal suppression of the 1999 Caprivi rebellion, cast a shadow over his legacy, Kamwanyah added.\n\nWhile Nujomas presidency was foundational in establishing Namibias independence and governance, it was not without flaws, Kamwanyah said.\n\nCAMPAIGNER AND GUERRILLA\n\nNujoma was born in a village in northwestern Namibia in 1929, when his country was under South African administration.\n\nSouth Africa had controlled Namibia since World War One after a brutal few decades of German colonial rule remembered for the genocide of the Herero and Nama people.\n\nAs a boy he looked after his familys cattle and attended a Finnish mission school, before moving to the coastal town of Walvis Bay and then the capital Windhoek, where he worked for South African Railways, according to a biography posted on the website of Nujomas charitable foundation.\n\nNujoma left his job on the railways to focus his energies on bringing down the apartheid system.\n\nIn the late 1950s he became leader of the Owambo Peoples Organisation, a precursor to liberation movement SWAPO, organising resistance to the forced relocation of Black people in Windhoek that culminated in the police killing 12 unarmed people and wounding dozens more.\n\nNujoma was charged with organising the resistance and arrested. In 1960, he went into exile. He travelled across Africa before reaching the United States, where he petitioned the United Nations for Namibias independence.\n\nMade SWAPO leader in absentia, Nujoma established its armed wing and in 1966 launched a guerrilla war against the apartheid government.\n\nIt took more than a decade of pressure from Nujoma and others before a U.N. Security Council resolution in 1978 proposed a ceasefire and elections, and another decade for the ceasefire deal to be signed and elections held in late 1989.\n\nSWAPO won a majority in those elections, and Nujoma took office in March the following year.\n\n",

The BJP denies his claims.\n\nKejriwal, who was released on bail and resigned as Delhi chief minister to focus on campaigning for the state election, lost the seat he was contesting.\n\nAAP will play the role of constructive opposition after trying to improve the citys infrastructure, education, and healthcare in the past ten years, Kejriwal said in a video message on X.\n\nAAP, which won the past two elections with thumping majorities, was popular because of its largesse, such as free water and power for the poor, its main voter base.\n\nTo counter AAP, the BJP promised monthly payments of 2,500 Indian rupees ($28) to all poor women, a one-time payment of 21,000 rupees to each pregnant woman, subsidised cooking gas, a monthly pension of 2,500 rupees for the elderly and 15,000 rupees for the youth to prepare for competitive exams.\n\nModi lost his majority in Indias Parliament last year but returned as prime minister for a record-equalling third term with the support of regional parties. His BJP has won three of four subsequent State elections.\n\nState election victories help political parties boost their numbers in the upper house of parliament, which is key for decision-making.\n\n",
