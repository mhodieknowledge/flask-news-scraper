            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA Harare family is demanding justice after the death of Samuel Machara, who was fatally attacked by a pitbull over the weekend.\n\nMachara was killed in Bluffhill, becoming the latest victim of the vicious dog in recent months.\n\nThe Machara family came face to face with the dogs owner, Mike Mupinga, who is facing a culpable homicide charge when he appeared at Harare Magistrates Court on Tuesday.\n\nHe will remain locked up after his bail ruling was moved to Friday.\n\nAccording to Bluffhill residents, three pitbulls belonging to a negligent Mupinga had become a menace.\n\nMike is arrogant. We filed a lot of complaints regarding the problems and risks posed by his dogs. Unfortunately, the more you reprimanded him, the more he would show his arrogant side, said one neighbour.\n\nWhen NewZimbabwe.com visited Bluffhill, a ramshackle kennel in which Mupinga kept his four dogs, the perimeter wall too short to secure the dangerous animals.\n\nEfforts to lobby authorities over the viciousness of the pitbulls fell on deaf ears, with officials turning a blind eye to Mupinga.\n\nElijah Machara, who was the first to find his uncles body, said the death had shaken the family.\n\nI was told by a neighbour to come and check on an unconscious body. When I got closer, I found Uncle Samuel dead. He had a deep cut on his neck, and my worst fear became reality  he was dead, said Machara.\n\nMachara is the latest victim in a rising number of fatal pitbull attacks, raising concerns about the safety and coexistence of pitbulls and people.\n\nAn estimated 12 countries worldwide have banned pitbull ownership, and there are growing calls for Zimbabwe to impose similar restrictions.\n\nHarare Mayor Jacob Mafume, in a social media post, said the City Council is working on regulating pitbulls.\n\nWe have raised concerns. We will explore whether, as council, we can stretch our mandate. Our position is that such dogs are dangerous and must be banned or strictly regulated  like how one would regulate a firearm, said Mafume.\n\n",

            "content": "SABC News\n\nZimbabwe head coach Justin Sammons has thrown his weight behind South Africa as they continue their preparations for the World Test Championship Final against Australia.\n\nThe South African, who was appointed as the head coach of The Chevrons in June last year, will lead his team in a one-off four-day match against the Proteas at the Arundel Castle Cricket Ground.\n\nThe Proteas are using this game as a final warm-up before facing the Aussies. Sammons says the two teams will go into that match on an equal footing.\n\nI think South Africa have a great chance of taking that World Test Championship final. Two evenly matched teams. Its going to be a really good game and ultimately it will be decided by the batting unit that can fare best against two quality bowling attacks, he predicted.\n\nThe former Proteas batting consultant is also quite excited to be facing his native nation over the next few days.\n\nThis will also serve as good preparation for the official test series that the neighbours will play at the end of this month in Bulawayo.\n\nThe next four days against South Africa offer our team an amazing opportunity to prepare for what promises to be an exciting and challenging winter, with two tests against the same team and another two against New Zealand.\n\nSo the guys are really looking forward to the challenge and obviously the learnings that will come from it.\n\nIt is good for this group and for Zimbabwean cricket in general that theres so much test cricket available for them this year and obviously towards the end of last year. Its where your fundamentals are tested, and as a young group of players, its where youre going to take the greatest amount of learnings, concluded Sammons.\n\nZimbabwe played a one-off test match against England almost two weeks ago, and were ruthlessly beaten by an innings and 45 runs.\n\nThe coach admitted that the occasion got the better of his team, and says that there was a lot of anxiety among the players.\n\n",

Hundreds of families fled their homes.\n\nAccording to the Zimbabwe Migrants Support Network (ZiMSN) chairperson Chris Mapingure, 127 people have now opted for voluntary repatriation after appearing in the Kirkwood Magistrates Court on Monday.\n\nThe Zimbabwean consulate is arranging transport back to Zimbabwe.\n\nMapingure condemned the arrests coming so soon after the xenophobic attacks. People had lost loved ones and some lost their property. Most lost their travel documents and will need time and money to replace the documents. This is unfair and unfortunate. People were supposed to be given an opportunity to collect their belongings and time to mourn and bury the dead.\n\nPolice spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge told GroundUp that the arrests were conducted by immigration officers from the Department of Home Affairs and the South African Police Service only provided the holding cells.\n\nThe deadly xenophobic attacks last weekend are under investigation by police. There have been no arrests.\n\nWarrant officer Majola Nkohli told GroundUp charges of intimidation and conspiracy to commit crime had been added to the docket. There is information coming out, some in the form of voice notes, which have been elements of intimidation and conspiracy to commit crime during the unrest, Nkohli said.\n\nThe leader of the South African National Civic Organisation (SANCO) in the Sundays River Valley, Patrick Bayeni, said the situation in Addo has calmed down and it is safe for the remaining Zimbabwean families to return.\n\nWe have members on the ground there to monitor the situation and assure whoever wants to return to come back without any fear, he said.\n\nHe said the father of the South African man whose murder triggered the violent revenge attacks has also urged the community not to harm immigrant community members.\n\nGroundUp sent questions to the Department of Home Affairs and Minister of Home Affairs Leon Schreiber but had received no response at the time of publication.\n\n",
