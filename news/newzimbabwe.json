            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nProphetic Healing and Deliverance Ministries founder, Walter Magaya, and his wife, Tendai, have been remanded in custody until this Tuesday following their appearance in court on fraud charges.\n\nThe couple is jointly charged with their company, Planet Africa, represented by Tendai Chinguwa.\n\nMagaya faces an extra charge of rape.\n\nThe duo appeared before Harare magistrate Marewanazvo Gofa, who is expected to hand down her ruling on their application demanding immediate release on the grounds that they were overdetained.\n\nTheir lawyer, Admire Rubaya, applied for their immediate release, arguing they were detained beyond the 48 hours allowed by law. He also raised complaints against the police.\n\nAccused 1 and 2 (Magaya and wife) were over-detained, said Rubaya. Magaya was arrested at 5am whilst praying in the prayer mountain, praying for everyone in this country. He was arrested by over 30 armed police officers. The accused is a man of God who cannot even harm a fly.\n\nSame applies to second accused, she has just been arrested because she is the wife of the first accused. She was arrested around 5.30am on Saturday. She was supposed to have been released at least by 5.30 am but wasnt. So the accused are here illegally.\n\nRubaya further told the court that the two were held incommunicado. They were not allowed to contact their lawyers. We visited CID Headquarters, where we had been advised they were. We were told they were not there. They were not permitted to contact their lawyers. They were not given access to their lawyers until after 11.30am on November 1, 2025, when one of the police officials who is a lawyer, Julia Chidumwa, contacted the lawyers so that we have access to them. She had to come to where we were at CID Headquarters to take us to the seventh floor, where the accused were being held. So from 5.30 to 11.30, they had no access to their lawyers and those constitutional rights were violated, he said.\n\nRubaya requested to lead Magaya to confirm the time of his arrest.\n\nState representative Clemence Chimbari admitted that the two were overdetained.\n\nRubaya argued that their constitutional rights had been violated. In their mind, they believe it is inconsequential but the Constitution is clear. Even if it is the state, they are obliged to follow the law, he said, adding that an exception could only be made if a court grants a warrant of further detention.\n\nHe said since the state admitted that the two were over-detained, the court should release them unconditionally.\n\nIt is our submission that you cannot put something on nothing. It will collapse. The state is asking you to put the accused on remand notwithstanding over-detention. Its no longer an alleged fact but a fact as confirmed by the state, said Rubaya.\n\nSo the state is coming to you to say we know they were over-detained but we dont care. Place them on remand. That on its own, is unconstitutional. They want to tell us there is a difference between the ZRP and the state.\n\nHe added, The main point we are raising is that the over-detention cannot be inconsequential. The law is clear. The law is bringing the accused after 48 hours. And they concede that it is after 48 hours. This court has jurisdiction to order that the accused persons be released unconditionally. If they want to arrest them after the release, they can do that and we will deal with them then. If they want to proceed by way of summons, they are at liberty to do so. What we are not allowing them is to contaminate the law by applying to place them on remand, yet they were detained beyond 48 hours.\n\nChimbari said there is a remedy.\n\nThe remedy for an infringement of a constitutional right the accused can approach the Constitutional Court for compensation or damages.\n\nChimbari said if the Court allows the immediate release, it will be overstepping its judicial powers.\n\nThe rape case was heard in-camera after the public and journalists were asked to leave.\n\nGofa will hand down her ruling Tuesday morning.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nThe Southern African Development Community (SADC) Election Observer Mission (SEOM) has declared that Tanzanias 2025 general election failed to meet its standards for a credible, free and fair vote.\n\nDelivering the preliminary statement in Dodoma on Monday, former Malawi Speaker of Parliament Richard Msowoya, who led the mission, said the polls fell short of the requirements of the SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections.\n\nThe election was conducted over two days: security forces voted on October 28 2025, in Zanzibar, and the rest of the electorate voted on October 29, 2025.\n\nMsowoya said observers encountered challenges in consulting with key stakeholders, particularly the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), as they had not been issued with Introduction Letters together with Accreditation Identification Cards as required by the law.\n\nHe noted that some INEC officials required the said Introduction Letters before consultations with the SEOM observers, but other officials did not make such a requirement.\n\nHe added that some stakeholders were reluctant to share information with the observers and often referred them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation.\n\nIn Tanga Town, observers were subjected to aggressive interrogation by the security forces, had their official documents, including their passports, seized, though later returned, and were forced to delete mission-related photographs from their official gadgets.\n\nThe mission observed that the country was largely calm during the pre-election period and most of election day, save for isolated incidents towards the closure of the voting.\n\nHowever, some stakeholders cautioned that the general calm and peace belies covert acts of general intimidation of the population and opposition political parties and candidates.\n\nThese stakeholders cited the alleged abductions of some political activists, Msowoya said.\n\nThe stakeholders highlighted the arrest of members of the opposition, notably the detention and trial of Tundu Lissu, the leader of the main opposition party, Chama cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo (CHADEMA), on treason charges.\n\nHe said, The disqualification of some opposition candidates, particularly of Mr. Luhaga Mpina of ACT-Wazalendo also raised questions about the fairness of the electoral landscape.\n\nSome viewed the arrests and disqualifications as undermining the URTs multi-party system by removing legitimate competition in the electoral process, creating an uneven political playing field and discouraging voter turnout.\n\nThe elections were overseen by the INEC and the Zanzibar Electoral Commission (ZEC).\n\nMsowoya said most stakeholders agreed that the bodies were adequately prepared to conduct the 2025 elections, and voter registration was conducted in phases.\n\nOut of a total population of 61.7 million, the commission registered 37.6 million voters  a 26.5% increase from 2020  with women making up 50.31% of registrants.\n\nHowever, some stakeholders expressed concern that there had not been any comprehensive electoral law reforms since the last elections, while others acknowledged some progress.\n\nThe mission pointed to constitutional provisions that limit electoral justice, such as Article 41(7), which effectively bars any court from entertaining any challenge against the results of a presidential election.\n\nMsowoya said this is contrary to the expectation of electoral justice as envisaged by Article 4.1.5 of the SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections.\n\nHe also noted that Articles 39, 67 and 77 restrict independent candidates, limiting the individuals freedom of association.\n\nSome stakeholders questioned the Commissions independence given that its members are appointed by the President, who is also chairperson of the ruling party and a presidential candidate.\n\nConcerns were also raised over early voting for security personnel in Zanzibar, with some viewing it as a potential risk for electoral fraud.\n\nThe mission noted that only three of the 17 presidential candidates were women.\n\nStakeholders cited persistent barriers to meaningful participation of women and youth, including limited campaign financing and logistics, leadership training and mentorship opportunities, internal nomination processes within parties, and enduring patriarchal norms.\n\nCultural attitudes also hinder the participation of the youth, Msowoya said.\n\nHe added that in some rural areas, when youth show interest in participating in elections, the elderly express their preference for married people as opposed to single youth.\n\nThe SEOM found that 49,174 registered voters were persons with disabilities.\n\nYouth and women-led organisations played an active role in voter education through radio, television, music and community-based initiatives, though concerns were raised about reduced funding for voter and civic education and delays in accreditation.\n\nThe mission also noted increasing covert and overt limitations on the right to freedom of expression and heavy censorship of online information platforms. Some social media platforms were inaccessible during the vote.\n\nOn election day, SEOM observed polling in 27 regions.\n\nThe Mission was able to observe the opening of polls in some polling stations but could not generate all data relating to opening and voting processes as a result of an internet outage around midday, Msowoya said.\n\nDue to protests and connectivity issues, the mission could not observe the closing and counting processes in most of the areas.\n\nDespite the challenges, the SEOM noted that 70% of the polling stations and their surroundings were free of campaign materials, and 93% of the polling stations observed opened on time.\n\nThe voters register was displayed in most polling stations, and the presence of police was observed at 96%, with most officers unarmed.\n\nHowever, the Mission noted a very low voter turnout in all polling stations observed, and some polling centres did not have voters at all.\n\nIn some polling stations observed, there were multiple orderly stacked ballots in the ballot box during voting, which created a perception of ballot stuffing, Msowoya added.\n\nDomestic observers were largely absent, he said.\n\nIn view of the Mission observations as detailed above, and mindful of the preliminary nature of this statement, it is the SEOMs tentative conclusion that, in most areas, voters could not express their democratic will.\n\nOverall, the 2025 General Election in the United Republic of Tanzania fell short of the requirements of the SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections.\n\nThe mission urged Tanzanians to channel their concerns through established legal procedures and processes and not resort to violence or threats thereof.\n\n",

            "content": "By Dyepkazah Shibayan and Aamer Madhani l Associated Press\n\nUNITED States President Donald Trump on Saturday said hes ordered the Pentagon to begin planning for potential military action in Nigeria as he stepped up his allegations that the government is failing to rein in the persecution of Christians in the West African country.\n\nThe president also warned that he will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria.If the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, guns-a-blazing, to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities, Trump posted on social media.I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action. If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!The warning came after Nigerias President Bola Ahmed Tinubu earlier on Saturday pushed back on Trump announcing a day earlier that he was designating the West African country a country of particular concern for allegedly failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.Nigerias president Bola TinubuIn a social media statement on Saturday, Tinubu said that the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality.Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so, Tinubu said.Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it. Nigeria is a country with constitutional guarantees to protect citizens of all faiths.Trump on Friday said Christianity is facing an existential threat in Nigeria and radical Islamists are responsible for this mass slaughter.Trumps comment came weeks after U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz urged Congress to designate Africas most populous country as a violator of religious freedom with claims of Christian mass murder.Nigerias population of 220 million is split almost equally between Christians and Muslims. The country has long faced insecurity from various fronts including the Boko Haram extremist group, which seeks to establish its radical interpretation of Islamic law and has also targeted Muslims it deems not Muslim enough.Attacks in Nigeria have varying motives. There are religiously motivated ones targeting both Christians and Muslims, clashes between farmers and herders over dwindling resources, communal rivalries, secessionist groups and ethnic clashes.While Christians are among those targeted, analysts say the majority of victims of armed groups are Muslims in Nigerias Muslim-majority north, where most attacks occur.Kimiebi Ebienfa, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, reiterated the commitment of Nigeria to protect citizens of all religions.The Federal Government of Nigeria will continue to defend all citizens, irrespective of race, creed, or religion, Ebienfa said in a statement on Saturday.Like America, Nigeria has no option but to celebrate the diversity that is our greatest strength.Nigeria was placed on the country of particular concern list by the U.S. for the first time in 2020 over what the State Department called systematic violations of religious freedom. The designation, which did not single out attacks on Christians, was lifted in 2023 in what observers saw as a way to improve ties between the countries ahead of then-Secretary of State Antony Blinkens visit.\n\nThe president also warned that he will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria.\n\nIf the Nigerian Government continues to allow the killing of Christians, the U.S.A. will immediately stop all aid and assistance to Nigeria, and may very well go into that now disgraced country, guns-a-blazing, to completely wipe out the Islamic Terrorists who are committing these horrible atrocities, Trump posted on social media.I am hereby instructing our Department of War to prepare for possible action.
