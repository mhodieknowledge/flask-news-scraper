Trying to turn a thief into a leader is the ultimate betrayal of the revolutionary party by a reactionary leader. The game has begun, and that rimming mouth will not be opened again.\n\nWhen a frog wakes up in ZANU-PFs Central Committee, it thinks all other positions are acquired by leaping! A historic party has been reduced to a rent-seeking, positions-for-sale party. How does a whole NPC [National Political Commissar] Machacha subordinate himself to a crook? Hurombo Huroyi, wrote Kasukuwere.\n\nBusinessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei(Photo credit JEKESAI NJIKIZANA/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTagwirei, a close ally of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, is reportedly eyeing the ZANU PF leadership when Mnangagwas constitutional term expires in 2028.\n\nThe businessman has been criss-crossing the country, hosting ZANU PF events, a move political observers describe as an attempt to galvanise support within the ruling party.\n\nHe has denied ambitions to succeed Mnangagwa, instead pushing for the presidents term to be extended beyond the constitutional two-term limit.\n\nBiti, who has been vocal against Tagwireis potential rise to power, said an audit should be conducted to trace funds the businessman allegedly gained through opaque government contracts.\n\nWe stand firm on principle & on deep-rooted values that have defined us for decades. We will never allow charlatans & crooks to take over the State, to emasculate the Constitution, or to buy their way into office. Criminals must know that one day soon, Zimbabwe will rise, and crooks will fall.\n\nA New Zimbabwe must audit all Treasury Bills issued by the Government in the last 20 years. Billions have been illicitly siphoned off in opaque transactions done outside parliamentary scrutiny. One crook has been awarded more TBs than any other entity in Zimbabwe. Its time for this audit! said Biti.\n\n",

It is structural and systemic. Stigma, isolated individuals, erode their self-worth and discourage vital actions like HIV testing, disclosure and adherence to treatment.\n\nDiscrimination in families, workplaces, health care settings and communities creates fear and silence that allow the virus to spread unchecked, Mombeshora said.\n\nOur collective commitment must be to build a pathway where every person living with HIV is treated with dignity, respect and compassion, free from judgment and fully supported to live a healthy, productive life.\n\nThe minister reported that the World Health Organisation emphasised that quality health care involved not only medicines, access, but also dignity, equity and inclusivity.\n\nDiscrimination in health care, such as segregated queues, bridges of confrontation or denial of care, atomised public trust, discourages service use and perpetuates inequities.\n\nResearch shows internalised stigma leads to shame, isolation, depression and loss of obesity, which reduce mental wellbeing and deter engagement with HIV services, the minister told the media.\n\nHe warned that fear of judgment causes delayed care, increasing risks of late diagnosis and treatment failure, undermining individual and public health.\n\nMombeshora commended the ZNNP+ for playing a pivotal role in shaping the countrys national HIV response.\n\nYou share public awareness, foster accountability and encourage dialogue that informs everything best decisions. You are not only merely conveyors of information, you are agenda setters, influencers of public sentiment and advocates for justice. Your voices are essential to advancing health equity, dispelling myths and amplifying the resilience of those affected by HIV.\n\nTo date, Zimbabwe has 1.3 million Zimbabweans living with HIV and over 96% are accessing life-saving antiretroviral therapy.\n\nWe have reached the UNAs 95-95-95 targets ahead of schedule, a milestone reflecting our strong infrastructure, committed healthcare workers and effective multi-sector collaboration.\n\nThe countrys gains on HIV remain fragile, according to Mombeshora.\n\nOur gains remain fragile. Between January and June this year, Zimbabwe recorded 5,932 AIDS-related deaths compared to 5,712 in the same period in 2024, an increase of 220 deaths. Reminding us, our work is still not done.\n\nThis rise is not due to partial withdrawal of partner support. By the time key partners like the US government withdrew some funding, our institutions had adequate ARR fees and supplies.\n\nThe minister highlighted that Zimbabwes systems had shown resilience and continued to monitor closely to ensure uninterrupted treatment.\n\nThe government has mobilised domestic resources through SIM taxes on alcohol, tobacco, sugar drinks at the AIDS level to protect ARR fees, stockpiles and maintain service continuity.\n\nThe Finance Ministry is reinforcing but in allocations, while we engage strategic partners to close funding gaps.\n\nWe must, however, be candid. The transition to full domestic financing introduces complex challenges, said the Minister.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nLocal property developer Leengate (Private) Limited has been ordered by the High Court to vacate within 30 days land on which quarrying operations were taking place at Rainham Farm after it emerged that the company encroached on someones property.\n\nLeengate was being sued by Mitchell Corporation Private Limited for encroaching on its Stand No 643.\n\nIn the present application, Mitchell Corporation applied for a summary judgment in an action for eviction and removal of structures.\n\nAccording to the applicant, Leengate or its agents erected buildings or other structures on the applicants land without any legal right, permission, or lease agreement.\n\nMitchell Corporation sought a summary order for the ejectment of Leengate and anyone claiming through it from the property, as well as the demolition or removal of all structures erected on the land.\n\nLeengate wanted the matter to go to a full trial.\n\nThe second respondent, Zvimba Rural District Council, is the local authority for the area; it was cited given its administrative interest in the land, though no specific relief beyond its formal citation is sought against it.\n\nLeengate denied having encroached into Mitchell Corporations land and claimed that one LLH Engineering Projects (Pvt) Ltd  is the true occupier/builder on the land in question.\n\nLeengate claimed that the applicant sued the wrong party.\n\nZvimba RDC did not file any opposing affidavit and took a neutral position, indicating it will abide by the Courts decision.\n\nAfter hearing the parties High Court judge, Justice Joel Mambara, ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered Leengate and its agents out before slapping the developer with costs on a legal practitioner-client scale.\n\nThe judge said it was noteworthy that Leengate provided virtually no detail about LLH Engineering Projects (Pvt) Ltd, apart from naming it as the alleged occupier.\n\nThe opposing affidavit does little more than assert the structures belong to LLH, not us. It does not explain the relationship (if any) between the first respondent and LLH Engineering  for example, whether LLH is a completely independent third party that coincidentally built on Stand 643, or perhaps a subcontractor or business partner of the first respondent in the Rainham development project.\n\nThe first respondent did not tender any affidavit from LLH Engineering, nor any documentary proof (such as an agreement, a council lease, or correspondence) indicating that LLH Engineering was authorised by the Council or anyone else to build on Stand 643. One would expect that if LLH Engineering truly and independently moved onto Stand 643, the first respondent could at least describe how that came about  especially since Leengate itself is involved in development projects in the same locale (indeed, the Rainham Park housing development has been linked to Leengate in the background).\n\nThe stark absence of any supporting detail or third-party confirmation raises serious doubt about the genuineness of this defence, said the judge.\n\nMambara said Leengates mere pointing of the finger at a non-party, without more, is arguably the kind of bald or sketchy averment that fails to pass muster as a bona fide defence.\n\nIt is therefore an appropriate exercise of this Courts discretion to order costs against the first respondent on the legal practitioner and client scale.\n\nSuch an order ensures that the applicant is more fully indemnified for the legal expenses it incurred due to the first respondents conduct, and it serves as a rebuke of the first respondents abuse of the court process.\n\nThe applicant should not be out of pocket for having to chase a party that had no valid defence and yet refused to concede.\n\nMambara said the applicant met the requirements for summary judgment, and the first respondent has failed to establish a bona fide defence or triable issue.\n\nThe first respondent, Leengate (Private) Limited, and all persons claiming occupation through the first respondent, be and are hereby ejected from Stand 643 Rainham Farm, Zvimba District, Mashonaland West.\n\nThis eviction encompasses the removal of any employees, contractors, agents, or associates of the first respondent, and includes any other entity (such as LLH Engineering Projects (Pvt) Ltd) or persons who occupy the property under or through the authority of the first respondent.\n\nThe first respondent shall, within 30 days of service of this order upon it, remove all structures, buildings, materials, plant, equipment and installations that it or anyone acting on its behalf (or through it) has erected or placed on Stand 643 Rainham Farm.\n\nThe removal shall be carried out safely and without avoidable damage to the land, and the site shall be restored, as far as reasonably possible, to its original condition prior to the first respondents occupation, said the judge.\n\nMambara also ruled that in the event that Leengate or those claiming occupation through it have not vacated the property or have not fully complied with paragraph 2 within the stipulated 30-day period, the Sheriff of the High Court or his lawful Deputy is hereby authorised and directed to evict the first respondent and any other unlawful occupiers from Stand 643 Rainham Farm.\n\nThe Sheriff was further authorised and directed to demolish, dismantle and/or remove any structures or materials remaining on the property that were erected or placed thereon by the first respondent or its agents, and to restore possession of the property to the applicant.\n\nHe said the Sheriff may enlist the assistance of the Zimbabwe Republic Police and/or the second respondent (Zvimba Rural District Council) to the extent necessary to carry out this order and ensure compliance in a peaceful and safe manner.\n\nThe RDC was ordered to cooperate with and facilitate the enforcement of this order to the extent that any administrative action or permission on its part is required.\n\nDuring the hearing, in support of its claim, the applicant proved that for instance, in mid-2024 when the encroachment was discovered, communications were exchanged involving the council and the first respondent.\n\nNotably, an email dated 15 July 2024 from the Council addressed to the applicant and copied to a representative of the first respondent (one K. Bhunu)  confirmed that a council inspection had found a durawall (boundary wall) built by the occupier of adjacent Stand 179 was indeed encroaching onto the applicants Stand 643.\n\nThe Council in that email reported the encroachment and indicated that the occupier of Stand 179 had been instructed to rectify the anomaly (remove or realign the wall).\n\nThe following day, 16 July 2024, the applicants legal practitioners sent a letter of demand to Leengate formally complaining of the encroachment.\n\nIn response, by 27 July 2024, Leengates legal practitioners replied in writing  effectively acknowledging the encroachment and proposing a resolution.\n\nIn that letter, Leengates lawyers confirmed they also represented LLH Engineering Projects (Pvt) Ltd (a company closely associated with the first respondent) and explained that these two companies held the adjacent Stands 179 and 644, with the applicants Stand 643 lying between them.\n\nThe letter further indicated that those entities were operating a quarry on Stand 179 and proposed a compromise arrangement: they suggested a re-pegging (boundary adjustment) that would reduce the applicants land in order to cure the encroachment, with the first respondent financing the re-survey, or alternatively an outright purchase of Stand 643 from the applicant.\n\nIn essence, Leengate at that stage offered to compensate for or eliminate the encroachment by realigning property boundaries or buying the land, implicitly conceding that an encroachment had occurred.\n\nDespite these discussions and the first respondents written undertakings to rectify the situation, nothing was actually done on the ground to remove the offending structures or resolve the issue.\n\nEventually, frustrated by the lack of concrete remedial action, the applicant issued a summons out of this Court (leading to the present proceedings).\n\nLeengates plea to the summons, however, painted a very different picture.\n\nIn its plea, Leengate denied that it was encroaching on the applicants land  offering little more than bare denials, and notably made no mention of LLH Engineering or the earlier communications and admissions.\n\nAfter the applicant filed this summary judgment application, in its opposing affidavit to the application, Leengate then raised the new defence that LLH Engineering Projects (Pvt) Ltd, not Leengate, was the party responsible for the structures on Stand 643.\n\nThe court said this shift in position  from tacitly acknowledging encroachment and attempting a compromise, to later denying any responsibility and blaming a third party marred Leengates defence.\n\n",

            "content": "By Tapiwa Svondo\n\nThe Zimbabwe Music Rights Association (ZIMURA) has said it will appeal its Executive Director Polisile Ncube Chimhinis fraud conviction, describing the ruling as unjust.\n\nChimhini was on Wednesday convicted of fraud by Harare Magistrate Rufaro Panavanhu. She was facing forgery and fraud charges and was acquitted.\n\nShe was acquitted of forgery but found guilty of fraud and fined US$300.\n\nIn a statement, the ZIMURA Director of Information, Alexio Gwenzi, said a notice of appeal against both the conviction and sentence had been filed.\n\nZIMURA was taken to court over allegations of misrepresentation of facts related to the filing of the CR6 form, a legally recognized document submitted to and stamped by the Registrar of Companies. This document was lawfully processed, paid for, and later tendered as evidence in the High Court in a separate case involving Phillip Chipfumbus membership dispute.\n\nZIMURA maintains that no misrepresentation, forgery, or fraud occurred in this matter. The CR6 was a legitimate filing under the Companies Act, and we firmly believe the conviction is unjust. As such, we have filed a notice of appeal to challenge both the conviction and sentence, said Gwenzi.\n\nIn July 2023, a complainant Philip Chipfumbu, filed a case against ZIMURA at the High Court and sought an audit of the music rights association. Chipfumbu later discovered that a CR6 document filed for ZIMURA by Chimhini was forged and not registered with the Department of Deeds, Companies and Intellectual Property. The CR6 was only registered later in January 2024.\n\nZIMURA further dismissed reports that Chimhini was remanded in custody.\n\nPlease take note that the malicious statements circulating that there was misappropriation of funds and that Mrs Chimhini was remanded in custody are mere lies aimed at tarnishing her image and brand Zimura. The fraud case is in relation to the CR6 form that was filed in the High Court of Zimbabwe, said Gwenzi.\n\nEarlier today, in a series of Facebook posts, Chimhini wrote, Dont worry Im safe, one doesnt go with a phone in jail.\n\n",
