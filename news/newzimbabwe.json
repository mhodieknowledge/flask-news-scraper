            "content": "IOL\n\nMany Zimbabweans who left the country at the peak of economic and political turmoil, and settled in numerous countries, including South Africa, are now investing back home, while others are returning to their ancestral nation.\n\nThese were the views expressed by Zanu PF national spokesperson, Christopher Mutsvangwa, who was recently in South Africa forthe 2025 Liberation Movements Summit hosted by the African National Congress (ANC) in Kempton Park.\n\nThe summit concluded on Monday and was hosted under the theme: Defending the liberation gains, advancing integrated socio-economic development, strengthening solidarity for a better Africa.\n\nSouthern African liberation movements, including the ANC, Peoples Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), Namibias ruling party, the South West Africa Peoples Organisation (Swapo); Mozambiques Frente de Libertao de Moambique (Frelimo); Zanu-PF, and Tanzanias ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) were represented at high level at the summit in Gauteng.\n\nMutsvangwa, in an interview withbroadcaster Newzroom Afrika, was asked for his views on the prevailing political and economic situation in Zimbabwe, which has resulted in the extensive migration of Zimbabweans into South Africa, estimated in the millions, sparking tensions in South African communities.\n\nIn his response, Mutsvangwa said Zimbabweans in South Africa are seeking greener pastures, but the situation back home has significantly improved.\n\nIt is the search for better pastures, that is natural. South Africa had the advantage of having comparative access to capital as a white apartheid state. In colonial times, capital into Africa followed white, and South Africa has the biggest white population on the African continent. All those Western countries gave South Africa a certain edge in access to capital.\n\nWe in Zimbabwe/Rhodesia were second in terms of our white population. We also had comparatively better access to capital than any other African country, and we had migration of labour from Mozambique, Malawi, and Zambia into Zimbabwe.\n\nThe former Zimbabwean ambassador to the Peoples Republic of China said people follow where they see an advantage in terms of development and capital.\n\nNow things have changed. We are now having capital in a flat global world where China can supply capital, India can supply capital, Riyadh can supply capital, so we now have an Africa that is going to global markets, getting capital. That discrepancy in access to capital, which was the case for the colonial era, is beginning to disappear.\n\nYou cannot believe it, there is now a seamless environment between life in Zimbabwe and life abroad. That is why our diaspora is coming back to Zimbabwe, putting a lot of money  our diaspora feels at home, they are now beginning to invest at home. For your information, the biggest diaspora migration is white.\n\nHe said the white Zimbabweans who had fled the country at the onset of majority rule in 1980 make up a good number of the people moving back into the landlocked Southern African nation ruled by President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nSo the return of the white diaspora back to Zimbabwe is actually an indication that things are getting better in Zimbabwe. Remember we are operating the hardest currency in the world, the US dollar, and if you can make your economy succeed on the back of the US dollar, it means you are doing very well as a country, said theWar Veterans Association chairperson.\n\nSpeaking to IOL,Dr Alexander Rusero, head of the department of international relations and diplomacy at the Africa University situated in Mutare, Zimbabwe, said the landlocked country seemingly has its worst times behind it  economically and politically.\n\nI think in all fairness, Zimbabwe has had its bad tide and we are definitely past that in as much as the mess we were once in as a country is concerned. That explains why you hear an opposition voice. We are as good as not having an opposition in Zimbabwe, and if you want to look at Zimbabwes dynamics currently, just look at the balance of forces within Zanu-PF.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Constitutional Court of Zimbabwe has granted direct access to businessman Jayesh Shah, the applicant, allowing him to challenge a prior decision made by the Supreme Court in a case he was ordered to pay US$130,000 to former Zupco chairperson Charles Nherera for malicious prosecution.\n\nIn the case, Shah aims to contest the Supreme Courts handling of his appeal against the above order relating to issues of malicious prosecution, arrest, and detention stemming from an ongoing legal battle with Nherera.\n\nThe complex legal saga traces back over two decades, originating from business dealings between Shahs company, Gift Investments (Private) Limited, and ZUPCO.\n\nThe conflict escalated following allegations of corruption, a bribery scandal that led to criminal charges against both parties, and ultimately a conviction for Nherera that was later overturned, resulting in a civil suit against Shah for wrongful prosecution, which claims damages totalling $400,000.\n\nNherera had claimed US$400,000 but the High Court ruled that the amount was too high.\n\nJustice Nicholas Mathonsi ordered Shah to compensate Nherera of US$130,000, which could be paid in local currency at the official exchange rate.\n\nUnhappy with the decision, Shah then approached the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Supreme Court previously upheld a decision awarding Nherera damages for malicious prosecution and arrest and Shah argues without sufficient evidence of how these damages were computed, raising eyebrows about the integrity of the legal process.\n\nShah, arguing that the Supreme Court decisions violated his rights to a fair hearing and equal protection under the law, sought direct access to the Constitutional Court.\n\nJustice Rita Makarau upheld his application, emphasising the importance of reviewing the Supreme Courts findings that were deemed binding on the trial courta decision that raised concerns of jurisdiction and independence when adjudicating the case.\n\nMakarau observed that the trial court appeared to surrender its authority, attributing overwhelming weight to the Supreme Courts acknowledgement of a prima facie case against Shah.\n\nIn summary, it appears to me that the trial court was conducted in a grossly irregular fashion, thereby robbing it of the fairness that is a prerequisite of a trial under the law.\n\nThe trial court wrongly and wrongfully surrendered its jurisdiction in the matter to the appeal court, again robbing the trial of the prerequisite that it must be before an independent and impartial judicial officer.\n\nThese irregularities could, and in my view, should have been reviewed by the court a quo. I venture to say that the irregularities would have been corrected had the correct law been applied, she said.\n\nThe Courts decision pointed out serious irregularities in the trial process, suggesting that the trial courts conduct signified a deprivation of Shahs constitutional rights.\n\nMakarau JCC noted, The effect and purpose of the decision a quo stand out clearly as validating the myriad of irregularities, highlighting a pronounced disconnect between the legal procedures and the guarantees afforded by the Constitution.\n\nFollowing the Courts decision, Shah is required to file a substantive application within ten days, where further examination of the contested findings will occur.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nListed real estate investment trust (REIT) Tigere has raised concerns over looming mono-currency uncertainties, warning that the policy shift is threatening funding streams in the sector.\n\nThe concern stems from recent remarks by central bank officials suggesting that Zimbabwe could transition to an exclusive use of the local currency by 2030. Authorities have indicated that efforts are underway to build foreign reserves and ensure macroeconomic stability ahead of the potential currency shift.\n\nPresenting its financial results for the year ended, Tigere said the policy signals have already started impacting confidence within the sector.\n\nGiven continued uncertainty surrounding the 2030 migration to mono-currency, the real estate sector remains predominantly equity-financed, the company said.\n\nEquity financing refers to the process of raising capital by selling shares in a company to existing shareholders or new investors.\n\nCommenting on the mono-currency plans, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) mission stressed the importance of further strengthening the monetary and foreign exchange frameworks. IMF staff also underscored the need to complement such efforts with measures that enhance demand for the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency.\n\nDespite these challenges, Tigere reported a solid performance. Net Property Income stood at US$1,205,846, up 56.6% from the previous year, driven largely by the inclusion of Highland Park Phase 2 in FY24, which continues to demonstrate growth in income and customer traffic.\n\nThe funds profitability remained robust, despite intensified competition and a volatile currency environment. Total Dividend Per Unit (DPU) rose by 44.8% year-on-year to US0.0951 cents, while Earnings Per Unit (EPU) increased 25.8% to US0.0925 cents. This was achieved despite a 48.8% increase in the number of units in issue, supported by an 87.2% year-on-year rise in comprehensive income to US$990,155.\n\nCollection rates also improved to 87.3% in HY25, up from 81.2% in the comparable period, following the implementation of stricter rental collection policies.\n\n",

This, Biti argues, is a prime example of how Tagwirei has undermined the nations financial stability through illicit means.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa had once described the local currency as the strongest in the region, although his government later devalued it and announced the introduction of the ZiG currency last April.\n\nTagwirei, who owns numerous companies, some under his well-known Sakunda Holdings, is also accused of netting millions of dollars through his Fossil company, which constructed the Trabablas Interchange in Harare at US$114 million, more than double the regional market prices.\n\nSpeaking to a local online news publication (263Chat) on Monday, Biti took a swipe at Tagwirei, branding him a criminal and unfit to become Zimbabwes President in future.\n\nIt is crazy to think that this criminal actually has ambitions to be the next President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, Biti said.\n\nIt cant happen and should not happen. It should not be allowed to happen, he added.\n\nBiti also challenged Zanu-PF, calling it a laughing stock for allowing its values to be disregarded due to greed for money and top-of-the-range vehicles.\n\nI feel pity for Zanu-PF. Zanu-PF is being reduced to a commodity that can be bought by a few trinkets. A few motor vehicles, a few GD6s, what kind of country have we become? Biti queried.\n\nThis comes after Tagwirei himself doled out some top-of-the-range vehicles to Zanu-PFs Harare Provincial leadership in his bid to be co-opted into the partys Central Committee, a move that has come crashing down like a deck of cards.\n\nBiti said thousands of liberation struggle war heroes are turning in their graves, believing they would not have gone to war had they known the current state of Zanu-PF, which people with money are hijacking.\n\n",
