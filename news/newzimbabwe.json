Any interpretation to the contrary is incorrect. Accordingly, the release of the accused will put the nation in unrest and undermine peace and security. In the circumstances, it is the courts finding that the state has managed to give compelling reasons justifying the continued detention of the accused person. Accordingly, bail is denied.\n\nWhat is an issue is not that applicant gathered and disseminated information. It is that information which he gathered which was intended to incite public violence, the magistrate said.\n\nThe admission to bail has been elevated to a constitutional right. But our Constitution is not novel. The onus is on the court to determine the bail.\n\nAn arrested person is entitled to be released unconditionally, it is only when there are compelling reasons an accused can be denied bail.\n\nThe court will need to weigh the reasons for granting and denying bail and weigh. In exercising this discretion, the court should put in balance the interests of the accused person and also not put administration in danger.\n\nHe said, It is a delicate discretion.\n\nGwatima added that the likelihood that an accused will abscond or interfere with investigations should be strongly supported.\n\nTurning to the present application, it is my considered view that grounds 3, 4, and 5his position at work, if granted bail, he is likely to interfere. Of critical importance, some of the witnesses have not been recorded hence, his release will jeopardise investigations.\n\n",

There, she recalled, the two statesmen enjoyed fishing together.\n\nThey were very close. It was beautiful . . . So when I heard about the passing on of our dear friend, the president, I said I would present myself in person to offer my condolences. I couldnt just stay in Zimbabwe and not come to commiserate with you, because of the relations we had and, specifically, the relationship he had with my husband, Grace told Kovambo while comforting her.\n\nGrace also shared that she knew Nujoma before he became Namibias founding president, as he visited her husband a lot.\n\nRELATED: Namibias founding father Sam Nujoma dies aged 95\n\nI knew President Nujoma even before he was president. When he was still fighting for the independence of the country, he used to visit my husband a lot. I would see them having conversations regarding what he wanted to see happen in Namibia, the commitment, the relentless fighting for what he thought was supposed to be the Namibia he wanted. He did it with so much love for the people of this country and when Namibia became independent, I was so happy because I saw him. I had experienced what he wanted for this country. I am happy that he was able to see all he wished for, Grace said.\n\nShe also praised Kovambos support for Nujoma, whom she described as a principled leader, noting the late icons achievements were made possible by her care and support.\n\nIm very happy to see you, Mama, I want to be like you, to live long like you. You are a source of inspiration, Mama. I also want to take this opportunity to thank you for looking after [your husband], you did a great job  because without you, he wouldnt have accomplished a lot of things he accomplished in Namibia, in Africa and beyond. It was all because of your support, Mama, Grace said.\n\n",

It is something that needs to be discussed between our company and the government, said Nico Muller, CEO of Implats.\n\nIt is something that is on the agenda for us to have a discussion with the finance minister [Mthuli Ncube] as well as the principle [Mnangagwe]. It is not something I want to scrub under the carpet.\n\nImplats 85% owned Zimplats borrowed money in order to pay for capital goods because the cash it was receiving from the dollar receipts fell short, said Meroonisha Kerber, Implats CFO in a presentation of the firms interim results on Thursday.\n\nFrom an efficiency point of view it makes sense to borrow there [in Zimbabwe] as well as from a discipline perspective because, as we have said, all our operations have to fund all of their own capital, she said.\n\nImplats said earlier today that it was assessing its portfolio in the event that poor platinum group metal prices persisted. Muller identified the firms Canadian mine Lac des Iles (Impala Canada) and Marula as the most vulnerable assets.\n\nLac des Iles would be run down as the firm had last year targeted its high margin ounces, reducing its reserve life. Regarding Marula, a decision has to be made in two years regarding a second phase expansion which would access up to 24 years of reserves. It first, however, had to become cash flow positive, said Muller.\n\nMuller said most of the cost cuts, including job losses, had been done with little now to reduce in overall corporate overheads. We are now at portfolio decisions, he said. There were several shafts in the firms flagship Rustenburg division that were also sailing close to the wind, he told media earlier in the day.\n\nImplats has invested heavily in the processing capacity of its Zimplats. Said Muller: We have always been positive about our investment orientation with regards to Zimbabwe. We do believe the Great Dyke offers the best available resource out there.\n\nWe have had a very constructive, healthy, long-standing relationship with the government and that has not necessarily changed.\n\n",

The infrastructure has been established featuring extra wide detour lanes designated as Express Lanes. To use the express lane, vehicles must be equipped with an e-tag which will be scanned by the system. Once detected, the boom banner will automatically open.\n\nPlease note that express lanes will not have a cashier on duty. In line with this, the ZINARA team will visit the new Parliament Building on the 26th of February and 5th March 2025 from 0900 hours to 1600 hours for the installation of the e-tags.\n\nAll Members of Parliament are encouraged to bring their two exempted vehicles along with their registration books for this installation exercise. Kindly note that failure to have electronic tags installed on exempt vehicles may cause significant inconvenience when passing through the tollgates. For more information, please visit Human Capital Department in office No. 340, said Mudenda.\n\nThe leader of the opposition Labour, Economists and African Democrats (LEAD) Linda Masarira rubbished the new benefits for MPs, saying they already have enough benefits.\n\nThe recent revelation that Zimbabwean Members of Parliament (MPs) and Senators now enjoy free tollgate passage, free parking, and the registration of two vehicles exempt from toll fees is yet another blatant display of elite privilege in a country where millions struggle to afford basic necessities. This new perk, added to their long list of extravagant benefits, is a direct insult to the suffering masses.\n\nWhile ordinary Zimbabweans are burdened with high transport costs, poor wages, and relentless economic hardships, our lawmakers continue to prioritize their own comfort over the needs of the people who elected them, said Masarira on X.\n\n",

The Chinese doctors are highly skilled, and we are very happy, Sangare said.\n\nFor patients like Sangare, whose lives were hindered by blurred vision, the initiative offers a renewed sense of independence and hope.\n\nThis initiative has helped me a lot. My grandchildren can now eat peanut butter from the peanuts I grow. I could not farm this year because of my cataracts, she said.\n\nCosmas Chipengo, a 25-year-old recipient of the surgery, said restoring his eyesight means he can now return to work after seven months.\n\nI want to thank the Chinese doctors because we could not afford the medical expenses. This program has done a great thing for us, he told Xinhua.\n\nZimbabwean Minister of Health and Child Care Douglas Mombeshora said that preventable blindness from cataracts remains a major public health issue in the country, but the Bright Journey program is helping address the challenge.\n\nThis moment represents not merely the commencement of a medical project, but the beginning of a bright journey, an important initiative that seeks to restore sight to 600 Zimbabweans, empowering them to reclaim their autonomy and reintegrate fully into society, Mombeshora said.\n\nAccording to the World Health Organization, an estimated 125,000 people in Zimbabwe were living with blindness in 2021, with 62,500 cases caused by cataracts. Due to the high cost of treatment, many low-income individuals, particularly in rural areas, are unable to access care, leading to preventable blindness.\n\nSpeaking at the launch, Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Zhou Ding said that the program not only reflects Chinas commitment to global health cooperation but also strengthens the deep and enduring friendship between China and Zimbabwe.\n\nThis year marks both the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations between China and Zimbabwe and the 40th anniversary of their medical cooperation.\n\nWith the launch of this program, we add another milestone to our anniversary celebrations, Zhou said.\n\nThe impact of the program extends beyond restoring sight as it enhances Zimbabwes medical expertise in eye surgeries and fosters knowledge exchange between Chinese and Zimbabwean medical professionals, the ambassador added.\n\n",

I really do not think I deserve this and I want to come home, back to England, as soon as possible.\n\nIn his judgement, High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden said he recognised that this is, in many ways, both a sobering and rather depressing conclusion.\n\nHe said that he was satisfied that the parents wish for their son to move to Ghana was driven by their deep, obvious and unconditional love.\n\nThe boy was at risk of suffering greater harm returning to the UK, he said.\n\nHe said that the boys parents believe and in my judgement with reason that their son has at very least peripheral involvement with gang culture and has exhibited an unhealthy interest in knives.\n\nThe boys father told the judge the couple did not want their son to be yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London.\n\nThe boy, who had lived in the UK since birth, said he was mocked and never settled in at the school in Ghana.\n\nHe said he could also barely understand what was going on and I would get into fights.\n\nThe boy wrote that he was so scared and desperate that he emailed the British High Commission in Accra as well as contacting the charity Children and Family Across Borders, who it is believed put him in touch with lawyers at the International Family Law Group.\n\nI am from London, England, and I want to go back home, he wrote.\n\nHe said he had been mistreated at the school, adding: Im begging to go back to my old school.\n\nHowever the High Court heard that the boys parents had sent him because they feared for his safety in London.\n\nIn a statement, his mother said sending him to Africa was not a punishment but a measure to protect him.\n\nShe referred to the murder of Kelyan Bokassa, the 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death on a bus in Woolwich in January. That was every parents worst nightmare, she said.\n\nShe said she did not believe her son would survive in the UK and did not want to be part of her sons destruction.\n\nRebecca Foulkes, representing the boys father, said the boy met 11 of the points on a checklist produced by the childrens charity NSPCC to indicate whether a child might have joined a gang or was being criminally exploited.\n\nThat included being absent from school, having unexplained money, buying new things, and carrying weapons.\n\nShe said it was not only the parents who were worried.\n\nHis school claimed it had suspicions about him engaging in criminal activities and had observed him in expensive clothes and with mobile phones.\n\nThe boy said he had never been part of a gang, nor involved in gangs in any way. He said he does not know anyone involved in a gang and he does not carry a knife.\n\nHe acknowledged in his statements that my behaviour wasnt the best and said he thought that was the reason his parents sent him to Africa.\n\nThe case centred on the question of parental responsibility, and whether the parents acted unlawfully by sending their son to boarding school without his consent.\n\nIn a statement issued after the judgement, his parents said: This has been a really difficult time for us all.\n\nThey added: Our priority has always been protecting our son and our focus now is on moving forward as a family.\n\nJames Netto from the International Family Law Group, who represented the boy, said the court judgement had been a real shock to the teenager.\n\nHe was obviously incredibly disappointed, incredibly upset and is considering his next steps carefully.\n\nThe boys barrister, Deirdre Fottrell KC, pointed out the school was not simply far from home  but a completely different jurisdiction.\n\nThe boy wrote that his education was suffering. He felt the Ghanaian classes were not as challenging as those in his English school, and he had been out of formal education entirely since last summer, studying online.\n\nHe wrote: I want to have an education again and grow up like a normal person. I feel like my brain is hurt here. I feel like now I am dumber than people I used to be smarter than.\n\nThe boys father has recently visited him in Africa, and he told the court that he and his son had got on well.\n\nHe said he would like his son to remain in Ghana, and said they visited a different boarding school where the boy could be considered for a place.\n\nThe father said they were both very impressed.\n\nHowever, questioned by Ms Fottrell, he acknowledged there was no place in that school until September, and that his son had not said he wanted to go there.\n\nThe boys solicitor said he had recently seen a rise in similar cases where teenagers were trying to return to the UK.\n\nTeenagers are often placed in exceptionally challenging or vulnerable situations, and are now beginning to turn to the court for protection, Mr Netto said.\n\nHe said he had seen cases where in their parents eyes young people were falling in with the wrong crowd or are adopting what their parents see as unorthodox or challenging behaviours.\n\nFollowing the judgement, he added: We have already received enquiries from young people in exactly the same situation as this young man.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nA number of cabinet ministers are under fire for not participating in Parliament business, a concern that has been raised by Speaker Jacob Mudenda.\n\nDuring Wednesdays Question and Answer (Q &A) session, Mudenda revealed that quite a number of cabinet ministers had given apologies on the pretext of being on national duty, something he said should be investigated.\n\nThe Q & A session is one of the most important Parliament business schedules where the public gets answers to policy questions asked by their constituency representatives (MPs) from cabinet ministers.\n\nIn recent years, cabinet ministers and the two VPs have evaded the session, leaving citizens without crucial information needed for developments sake.\n\nSeveral MPs have raised their concerns since the previous Parliament until now (10th Parliament), with the Speaker at one point having threatened to report culprits to President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nAfter listening to this, there are quite clear apologies that have been very consistent to you. And my suspicion is that these ministers who make apologies cannot be on national duty every week.\n\nI am therefore directing the truck and the staff to make a proper analysis of those ministers who have been consistently telling their apologies, said Mudenda.\n\nHe added, And such apologies do not seem to answer that, actually. And where you have deputy ministers, again, consistently accepting themselves as an apology, that cannot be accepted. Second, in terms of the Constitution, Provisional Section 107, Subsection 2, it is very clear that every Vice President, minister, and deputy minister must attend parliament and parliamentary committees in order to answer questions concerning matters for which he or she is collectively or individually responsible.\n\nChiwenga and Mohadi rarely come to Parliament during the Q and A session.\n\nHe went on, The challenges government is facing and what government is doing about those challenges. And that erodes public trust in the government of the day. We cannot afford to miss that golden opportunity.\n\nWe should not. And above all, it is the taxpayer who shoulders the responsibilities of us being in our offices. And that must be respected.\n\nThe Speaker highlighted that some important written questions had not been answered since 2024 to date.\n\nSaid Mudenda, And the apology must be taken sooner rather than later. Thats the first observation. The second observation is that when His Excellency addressed the cabinet, the 25th cabinet session, he made a very telling statement in which he was appealing to all the ministers and their deputies to perform in terms of their contribution on this.\n\nI have been analysing questions, written questions, which have not been attended to. And I will go through them. A question to the Minister of Industry and Commerce (Mangaliso Ndlovu). One question has been outstanding since the beginning of the programme.\n\nThen we have three questions outstanding from the Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water, and Rural Development. Outstanding since 27 November 2024 up to February 2012, 2025.\n\nThen we have six questions that have not been attended to by the honourable Minister of Health and Childcare (Douglas Mombeshora) from 16 October 2024 to 12 February 2025. Another six questions that have not been attended to since 16 October 2024 from the Minister of Public Services and Social Welfare up to 12 February 2025.\n\nThen we have 11 questions that have not been attended to by the Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion (Mthuli Ncube) from 16 October 2024 right up to 12 February 2025.\n\nAnd so all the questions are outstanding. I have analysed them, and then the Minister of Finance has seven questions outstanding, prepared since 16 October 2024 up to 12 February 2025.\n\nThree questions meant for Foreign Affairs Ministers then Fredrick Shava now headed by Amon Murwa) prepared from 30 October 2024 up to 12 February 2025.\n\nThere were three questions for the Minister of Local Government and Public Works ( Daniel Garwe)\n\nAs he continued with his list, Mudenda said he was doing this analysis in order to demonstrate that Parliament owes it to the public.\n\nWe owe it to Parliament that these questions of national interest must be dealt with and give the opportunity for other ministers, again as I said, to shine on government policy and indicate to the world that something is happening in spite of the Secretarys concerns.\n\nl hope and trust I will not be forced to analyse again such reports.\n\n",
