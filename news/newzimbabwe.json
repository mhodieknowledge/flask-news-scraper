            "content": "By Jeffrey Moyo | HealthPolicyWatch\n\nMWENEZI, Zimbabwe  Memory Sibanda tried three times to get antiretroviral medication from her usual clinic in February but was turned away.\n\nThe 67-year-old has lived with HIV for the past 28 years. Jobless and widowed since 2003 when her husband succumbed to AIDS, Sibanda is unable to afford to buy the medication should the government fail to supply it.\n\nShe finally received a three-month supply in late February  half the usual allocation  and is anxious about what will happen when this runs out.\n\nI dont know if this reduction of our treatment pills is happening only here in our village. Nurses dont say anything to us about what is happening with the pills. I fear we might eventually end up not receiving the drugs at all, meaning many of us might die, Sibanda, who lives in Chomutsvairo village in the southern province of Masvingo, toldHealth Policy Watch.\n\nIn the capital, Harare, a similar crisis faces HIV/AIDS patients. Mavis Makumbe, 65, has depended on free ARV treatment from the government for decades. But in late February, her whole life changed when she visited the New Start Centre in the city to fetch her medication.\n\nI found a notice on the door saying it was closed and no longer in operation. From there, I went back home and started taking the remaining tablets, but those again were not enough, said Makumbe, a widow who has lived with HIV for 24 years.\n\nFortunately, her daughters friends rescued her by buying six months allocation of ARVs. The current going rate is $20 for a months supply  a fortune for the average Zimbabwean, with80% of peopleworking in the low-income informal sector and battling huge inflationary costs each month.\n\nThis is unsustainable for Makumbe, who is also battling cancer on one of her legs.\n\nHIV positive prisoners also toldHealth Policy Watchthat medicines are scarce.\n\nNot so long ago, we were being given rations of limited ARVs. Things are now worse after America has stopped giving us aid. Even painkiller pills are now hard to find in jail, said an HIV positive prison inmate at Chikurubi Maximum Prison in Harare.\n\nThe ARV shortage was caused when US President Donald Trump suspended all foreign aid for 90 days with immediate effect on 20 January.The Trump administration has since disbanded the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and extended the aid cut for a further 30 days until 20 May.\n\nWe were put in a very tough situation by the aid cut by President Trumps government, said Stanley Takaona, president of the Zimbabwe HIV/AIDS Activist Union Community Trust.\n\nThe aid cut-off was a bit harsh. We are praying that both our government and the US government will put on a humanitarian face and save our lives, as people living with HIV, added Takaona, 62, who tested HIV positive at the age of 34 and started taking ARV treatment in 2001.\n\nThe governments pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) initiative targeted at people with high exposure to HIV like sex workers has also been suspended amid the Trump administrations global aid cuts.\n\nIn 2022, an estimated 1.3 million Zimbabweans were living with HIV, and 1.2 million were on ARVs  yet their medicine supply is now in jeopardy.\n\nZimbabwe has made significant progress against HIV, and in 2023 it became one of only five African countries that achieved the 95-95-95 targets set by UNAIDS, with an estimated 95% of people with HIV aware of their status, 98% on treatment, and 95% of those on treatment having suppressed viral loads.\n\nThis isaccording tothe United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), which has been the main recipient of the countrys Global Fund grant since 2009.\n\nBut with the US abandoning its commitments to combat the deadly virus abroad, activists like Sphiwe Chabikwa sees the gains made in fending off the disease being reversed.\n\nWe are at risk. People may start dying again like what happened around 2000 and 2002 before ARVs were made available to everyone with HIV. Im afraid, said Chabikwa, who lives in Harare.\n\nChabikwa is a member of the Zimbabwe National Network of People Living with HIV (ZNNP+), the countrys network of people living with HIV.\n\nFor the past 25 years, Chabikwa has lived with HIV, and her steady access to ARVs has enabled her to manage the virus as a chronic disease.\n\nI get the second-line of antiretroviral treatment, but that again has had its supplies affected by the recent US aid cut. Instead of people living with HIV like me getting six months supplies of ARVs, this has now been reduced to three months supplies. That means the treatment drugs are in short supply and the authorities are trying to manage a crisis.\n\nHealth experts predict that all the gains Zimbabwe made in defeating HIV might go to waste following the abrupt withdrawal of US aid.\n\nLong queues now characterise the collection of HIV treatment, and patients are fearful about what the future holds for them.\n\nFearing a future without ARVs, some other HIV patients admit to bribing nurses in order to get six months allocation of ARVs.\n\nMany HIV positive people in my area, including myself are now bribing nurses at local clinics in order to get the usual six months allocation of treatment drugs, said a resident from Harare who asked to remain anonymous.\n\nZimbabwean nurses stationed at clinics distributing ARVs have capitalized on the patients fears.\n\nIts our time to make money from the desperate HIV patients because our salaries alone cant sustain us and so, with the now scarce ARVs, we just put a small fee on them for our own benefit in our backdoor deals with patients, said a nurse at one of the clinics in Harare who spoke to Health Policy Watch on condition of remaining anonymous.\n\nYet the Zimbabwean authorities have denied that ARVs have run out. During a parliamentary question-and-answer session in February, Health Minister Douglas Mombeshora assured the nation that access to HIV treatment will continue despite global aid uncertainty.\n\nMombeshoraclaimedthat Zimbabwe has secured enough stock of antiretroviral (ARV) drugs to last for the next six months.\n\nDespite the Ministers assurance, HIV patients have seen their treatment allocations reduced and those living with HIV fear the worst.\n\nHowever, the Zimbabwean government is developing an HIV sustainability plan to address long-term funding issues and mobilising domestic resources to maintain priority HIV programmes,according to a UNAIDSreport released on 31 March.\n\nOver the past five years, the US provided over $1 billion Zimbabwe to combat HIV.\n\nBefore widespread access to ARV therapy in Zimbabwe, AIDS was a leading cause of death and estimated 130,000 people dying from HIV-related complications in 2002 alone, according to UNAIDS.\n\nThe availability of ARVs significantly reduced AIDS deaths, with the death toll dropping to around 20,200 by 2021, according to UNAIDS. Adult HIV prevalence has fallen from its peak of 26.5% in 1997 to 11.9% in 2021.\n\nOlive Mutabeni, executive director for Life Empowerment Support Organization (LESO), a community-based HIV/AIDS organization in Zimbabwe, has challenged authorities to step up and purchase ARVs.\n\nThere is a need for the Ministry of Health and the National AIDS Council to address this issue of ARVs supplies urgently before we lose people, said Mutabeni.\n\nMutabeni, aged 64, started taking ARVs in 2009 yet 16 years later, she is unsure of her access to treatment: I am worried that many HIV patients like me might soon perish like flies.\n\nThe permanent discontinuation of HIV programmes currently supported by the US Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) would lead to an additional 6.6 million new HIV Infections and additional 4.2 million AIDS-related deaths between 2025 and 2029,according to UNAIDS modelling.\n\nImage Credits:DFID,Jeff Moyo.\n\n",

            "content": "By Otaviano Canuto and Sabrine Emran\n\nRABAT/WASHINGTON, DC  The clean-energy transition has fueled the global race for critical minerals, transforming elements like lithium, cobalt, and rare earths into strategic assets. At the center of this emerging resource war is the escalating rivalry between China and the United States, both of which are keenly aware that controlling mineral supply chains is essential to technological dominance.\n\nCritical minerals  especially lithium, nickel, cobalt, manganese, and graphite  are essential to sectors like semiconductors, electric-vehicle batteries, renewable energy, and defense. Rare earths, for example, are vital for the permanent magnets used in wind turbines and EV motors, while the power grids that sustain modern economies rely on huge quantities of aluminum and copper.\n\nThe geopolitical importance of critical minerals has surged in recent years, driven not only by their role in the green transition but also by the increasing fragility of concentrated supply chains. China currently dominates global mineral processing, refining more than 60% of the worlds lithium, 85% of its rare-earth elements, and 95% of its manganese.\n\nThis dominance has created new strategic vulnerabilities. A prime example is Chinas recent export restrictions on gallium and germanium, which show how critical inputs can be weaponized by great powers to gain a technological edge.\n\nUltimately, the green transitions trajectory will depend not only on where mineral deposits are located but also on how governments adapt. As countries shift away from fossil fuels, they risk replacing one form of resource insecurity with another unless they confront the complex dynamics of mineral supply and demand. Yet much of the current debate focuses on expanding supply, overlooking potential efficiency gains, as well as advances in recycling and material substitution.\n\nImportantly, Chinas resource dominance is not the result of vast mineral reserves but of strategic foresight. Although it controls only a fraction of the worlds minerals, China has spent decades bolstering its processing capabilities through targeted industrial policies, enabling it to control key stages of the global manufacturing pipeline. As a result, technology has emerged as the central axis of geopolitical realignment.\n\nWhile the US maintains a competitive edge in advanced semiconductor design and manufacturing equipment, China dominates clean-energy supply chains, from solar panels to batteries. But the US remains fully import-dependent for 15 critical minerals  including gallium and rare earths  and more than 50% dependent for another 34.\n\nGiven that China is the primary supplier of nearly half of these minerals, it is clear that Americas resource dependence poses a strategic threat to key sectors, including semiconductor production, defense, and clean energy. Recognizing these growing vulnerabilities, former US President Joe Biden signed the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act to boost semiconductor manufacturing. President Donald Trumps administration is currently pursuing an even more domestically oriented approach aimed at accelerating the extraction of critical minerals while streamlining the permitting process for mining projects on federal land.\n\nBut mineral security cannot be achieved through domestic production alone, which is why the Biden administration joined allies like Australia, Canada, and the European Union to establish the Minerals Security Partnership  an initiative aimed at friendshoring mineral production. Trump, by contrast, has adopted a more assertive approach, threatening to acquire Greenland one way or another and attempting to pressure Ukraine into a critical-mineral deal.\n\nThe scramble for critical minerals could have profound geopolitical implications, as resource-rich developing countries find themselves courted by both the US and China. At the same time, global industries face the prospect of fragmented supply chains divided along geopolitical lines.\n\nAfrica, home to roughly 30% of known mineral reserves  including 85% of the worlds manganese and 80% of its platinum and chromium  has emerged as a focal point of resource competition. This is especially true for countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), which holds an estimated 70% of global cobalt reserves, and platinum-rich South Africa.\n\nYet the disconnect between Africas vast resource wealth and its limited economic development remains striking. Many African economies like the DRC rely heavily on raw-material exports, having failed to invest meaningfully in value-added processing. Consequently, Sub-Saharan economies capture, on average, just 40% of the potential revenue from their natural resources  a gap that reflects a deeper systemic failure to unlock the full economic potential of these assets.\n\nBauxite is a case in point illustrating the vast economic opportunities lost due to the continued export of unprocessed commodities. While raw bauxite ore sells for roughly $92 per ton, its refined form  aluminum  fetches around $2,438 per ton.\n\nDespite its dominant share of global cobalt reserves, the DRC remains heavily dependent on raw-material exports. This overreliance, combined with a lack of vertical integration and economic diversification, leaves the country vulnerable to sharp downturns if global cobalt prices fall for an extended period.\n\nDelivering mutual benefits for mineral-rich African countries and the global industries that depend on their resources requires moving away from the exploitative models that have long shaped the global economy  and the US is uniquely positioned to offer such an alternative. To do so, it must champion an E3 framework: economically feasible, environmentally sustainable, and ethically grounded.\n\nIn addition to technological innovation, Americas critical-mineral policy should be guided by ethical engagement and infrastructure development. The Lobito Corridor  a US-backed project that aims to renovate the railway connecting Angola to land-locked cobalt and copper mines in the DRC and Zambia  demonstrates how strategic mineral development can generate value for local economies by supporting in-country processing rather than relying solely on raw exports.\n\nEncouragingly, the US has signaled its willingness to engage with mineral-rich Sub-Saharan countries. But the limited presence of US private-sector mining operations in the region, together with the rapidly shifting geopolitical landscape, underscores the need for an innovative, strategic approach focused on long-term value creation and mutually beneficial partnerships.\n\nOtaviano Canuto, a former vice president and executive director of the World Bank, executive director of the International Monetary Fund, vice president of the Inter-American Development Bank, and deputy minister of finance of Brazil, is a non-resident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a senior fellow at the Policy Center for the New South.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development has backtracked on its statement that contractors are now on site and rehabilitation of the dilapidated Bulawayo-Victoria Falls Road will soon start, claiming wrong information was posted.\n\nA state-run newspaper on Monday published an article stating that eight contractors involved in the rehabilitation of the Bulawayo-Vic Falls road were now on site, which was shared on the Transport Ministrys X page.\n\nThis was despite an advert inviting contractors to bid for the upgrade of the road, stating that the tender process only closes on April 29, raising concerns that the contracts had been corruptly awarded.\n\nFor those who found it hard to believe that Emmerson Mnangagwa is the most corrupt politician Zimbabwe has ever had, here is your answer.\n\nThey floated a tender for the repair of the BulawayoVictoria Falls Road, and the closing date for this tender process is today, 29 Aprilhttps://t.co/ptkcv55ziKpic.twitter.com/5pkcogUJuC\n\n Hopewell Chinono (@daddyhope)April 29, 2025\n\nIn a statement, the Permanent Secretary for Transport and Infrastructural Development, Eng. Joy Makumbe said no contractor has been awarded the tender for the 440.4 kilometre project.\n\nThe Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development wishes to unreservedly apologise to members of the public and all its stakeholders for posting a Twitter message containing incorrect information on April 29, 2025, at 09:18 hours.\n\nThe Twitter message tagged a story published on April 28, 2025, by The Herald Online, which was headlined: Victoria Falls contractors on site. The Ministry acknowledges that no contractor is on site, as the tender process is still ongoing, the statement reads.\n\nThe permanent secretary said the error was due to a breach of internal protocol caused by their social media officer, who failed to verify the information.\n\nAdded Makumbe, One of the officers assigned the duty to manage the Ministrys Twitter handle conceded and acknowledged that she breached the internal Standard Operating Procedures for information verification by not verifying the authenticity of the facts with the technical officials in the Department of Roads before posting.\n\nThe Ministry stated that an evaluation committee will now review the bids before submitting its recommendations to the Special Procurement Oversight Committee.\n\nThe Ministry wishes to set the record straight on the matter as follows: the tender which was issued on April 17, 2025, closed on April 29, 2025, at 11:00 hours.\n\nAfter the closure of the bidding period, an evaluation committee will convene, whereupon the outcome will be sent to the Special Procurement Oversight Committee for oversight of the tender process before awarding the same to successful bidders, said Makumbe.\n\nThe reconstruction of the entire road is set to take 36 months, according to the Minister of Transport, Felix Mhona. The Bulawayo-Victoria Falls road is of major concern as it leads to Zimbabwes main tourist attraction.\n\n",

He is now in the Central Committee, whose position he got through the back door. He is not stopping there, he wants to become the President of the country. That is unacceptable. We will not accept this, said Geza.\n\nBusinessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei(Photo credit JEKESAI NJIKIZANA/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTagwirei, through his proxies, has been securing government contracts. He won a multimillion-dollar deal to construct the Mbudzi Interchange flyover.\n\nHe has also expanded his business interests into mining and has a near-monopoly in the fuel sector.\n\nAdditionally, Tagwirei has been spearheading the Command Agriculture programme and is currently the chairperson of the Land Tenure Implementation Committee.\n\nThe business moguls company, Sakunda Holdings, was implicated in the disappearance of $3 billion from the Ministry of Agriculture between 2017 and 2018.\n\nAs a result, Tagwirei was sanctioned by the United States of America, which accused him of assisting senior government officials in corruption.\n\nGeza blasted Tagwirei and tenderpreneur Wicknell Chivayo, accusing them of corruption, which is bleeding the country.\n\nLook at the effects of this corruption. Our civil servants are getting peanuts. University lecturers are on strike protesting poor salaries. Even students have joined their lecturers.\n\nWhen you see University lecturers demonstrating, know the situation has deteriorated. It is a mockery when Chivayo, a grade seven, is being given millions just because they are close to Mnangagwa, said Geza.\n\n",

Such behaviour has no place in society and media specifically, where voices should uplift, not degrade. Moja Love (DStv 157) as a platform is committed to fostering a respectful and inclusive environment. We refuse to stay silent.\n\nMisogyny on air doesnt only harm the individuals targeted, it perpetuates a toxic culture that normalises the dehumanisation of women. Yesterday we took a firm stance against this conduct, and we will continue to challenge such rhetoric whenever it arises. Media is designed to shape societal norms, and with that influence comes responsibility. To MacG and others who use their platforms carelessly: accountability is not optional. We urge audiences and broadcasters alike to reject sexist vitriol and demand better. Respect isnt a privilege, its a right.\n\nThe channel has also received flack for airing a recent episode of the reality showIsencane Lengane.\n\nThe show, in its seventh season, which follows the lives of Siyacela Dlamuka and Thando Msomi, who married when they were teenagers,sparked outrage among viewers, with many raising concerns about the couples toxicity.\n\nAccording to Moja Love,Isencane Lenganeis designed to contribute to the discourse on gender-based violence and societal ills, with the aim of raising awareness and promoting positive change.\n\nMoja Love said they are committed to providing psychological support to affected members, including Thando, who was affected by events depicted in the show, and would continue to offer support.\n\nIt is important to note the show is a reality show which reflects, explores and raises awareness and contributes to the discourse on gender-based violence and societal ills. The channel has through many of its social justice programmes played a pivotal role in shaping discourse and contributing positively in society, read thestatement.\n\n",
