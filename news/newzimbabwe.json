But for many survivors and human rights advocates, the effort feels hollow, not least because of who is leading it.\n\nAt the time of the atrocities, Mnangagwa was the Minister of State for National Security, serving under then-President Robert Mugabe. His involvement in the security structures responsible for the crackdown has cast a long shadow over the current initiative.\n\nGeopolitical analyst Aaron Ngambi believes the process is more about optics than accountability.Mnangagwa seems determined to close this chapter, but many view it as an attempt to whitewash the past, Ngambi said in an interview. Its difficult to talk about reconciliation when those accused of complicity are in charge of the process.\n\nThe Gukurahundi killings, carried out by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade, targeted members of the Ndebele ethnic group in the aftermath of Zimbabwes independence. The violence has never been properly investigated, and the state has long resisted calls for justice and recognition.\n\nNow, with the renewed focus on the issue, some observers say the timing may be politically motivated, part of a broader effort by Mnangagwa to shape his legacy and consolidate power in the run-up to future elections.\n\nAny reconciliation process that fails to include survivors, civil society and independent investigators will never be seen as credible, Ngambi warned. This moment demands openness, not control.\n\n",
