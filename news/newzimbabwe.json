            "content": "BBC\n\nBrazen! It is brazen! Prof Paul Sereno says down the phone line from Chicago.\n\nHe makes no effort to disguise his anger that a rare meteorite from Mars discovered two years ago in the West African nation of Niger ended up being auctioned off in New York last month to an unnamed buyer.\n\nThe palaeontologist, who has close connections with the country, believes it should be back in Niger.\n\nThis millions-of-years-old piece of the Red Planet, the largest ever found on Earth,fetched $4.3m (3.2m) at Sothebys. Like the buyer, the seller was kept anonymous.\n\nBut it is unclear if any of this money went to Niger.\n\nFragments of extraterrestrial material that have made their way to Earth have long inspired reverence among humans  some ending up as religious objects, others as curiosities for display. More recently, many have become the subject of scientific study.\n\nThe trade in meteorites has been compared to the art market, with aesthetics and rarity affecting the price.\n\nAt first, there was a sense of awe surrounding the public display of this extraordinary Martian find  less than 400 of the 50,000 meteorites discovered have been shown to come from our planetary neighbour.\n\nThe photographs taken at Sothebys of the 24.7kg (54lb) rock  appearing in the lights to glow silver and red  compounded this feeling.\n\nBut then some people started asking questions about how it ended up under the auctioneers hammer.\n\nNot least the government of Niger itself, which,in a statement, expressed doubts about the legality of its export, raising concerns about possible illicit international trafficking.\n\nReuters The meteorite, seen here in close-up, travelled some 225 million kilometres before crashing down to Earth\n\nSothebys strongly disputes this, saying the correct procedures were followed, but Niger has now launched an investigation into the circumstances of the discovery and sale of the meteorite, which has been given the scientific and unromantic name NWA 16788 (NWA standing for north-west Africa).\n\nLittle has been made public about how it ended up at a world-renowned auction house in the US.\n\nAnItalian academic articlepublished last year said that it was found on 16 November 2023 in the Sahara Desert in Nigers Agadez region, 90km (56 miles) to the west of the Chirfa Oasis, by a meteorite hunter, whose identity remained undisclosed.\n\nMeteorites can fall anywhere on Earth, but because of the favourable climate for preservation and the lack of human disturbance, the Sahara has become a prime spot for their discovery. People scour the inhospitable landscape stretching across several countries in the hope of finding one to sell on.\n\nAccording to the Italian article, NWA 16788, was sold by the local community to an international dealer and was then transferred to a private gallery in the Italian city of Arezzo.\n\nThe University of Florences magazine described the person as an important Italian gallery owner.\n\nA team of scientists led by Giovanni Pratesi, mineralogy professor at the university, was able to examine it to learn more about its structure and where it came from. The meteorite was then briefly on display last year in Italy, including at the Italian Space Agency in Rome.\n\nIt was next seen in public in New York last month, minus two slices that stayed in Italy for more research.\n\nSothebys said that NWA 16788 was exported from Niger and transported in line with all relevant international procedures.\n\nAs with everything we sell, all relevant documentation was in order at each stage of its journey, in accordance with best practice and the requirements of the countries involved.\n\nA spokesperson added that Sothebys was aware of reports that Niger is investigating the export of the meteorite and we are reviewing the information available to us in light of the question raised.\n\nProf Sereno, who founded the organisation NigerHeritage a decade ago, is convinced Nigerien law was broken.\n\nThe academic with the University of Chicago, who has spent years uncovering the countrys vast deposits of dinosaur bones in the Sahara, campaigns to get Nigers cultural and natural heritage  including anything that has fallen from outer space  returned.\n\nA stunning museum on an island on the River Niger that runs through the capital, Niamey, is being planned to house these artefacts.\n\nInternational law says you cannot simply take something that is important to the heritage of a country  be it a cultural item, a physical item, a natural item, an extraterrestrial item  out of the country. You know weve moved on from colonial times when all this was okay, Prof Sereno says.\n\nA series of global agreements, including under the UNs cultural organisation Unesco, have tried to regulate the trade in these objects. But,according to a 2019 studyby international law expert Max Gounelle, when it comes to meteorites, while they could be included, there remains some ambiguity about whether they are covered by these agreements. It is left to individual states to clarify the position.\n\nNiger passed its own law in 1997 aimed at protecting its heritage.\n\nProf Sereno points to one section with a detailed list of all the categories included. Mineralogical specimens are mentioned among the art works, architecture and archaeological finds but meteorites are not specifically named.\n\nIn its statement on the Sothebys sale, Niger admitted that it does not yet have specific legislation on meteorites  a line that the auction house also pointed out. But it remains unclear how someone was able to get such a heavy, conspicuous artefact out of the country without the authorities apparently noticing.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Meteorite hunters, like this one in Morocco, search the landscape for the space rocks\n\nMorocco has faced a similar issue with the huge number of meteorites  more than 1,000  found within its borders, which include a part of the Sahara.\n\nMore than two decades ago the country experienced what author Helen Gordon described as a Saharan gold rush, fuelled in part by laxer regulations and a more stable political environment than some of its neighbours.\n\nIn her recent book The Meteorites, she wrote that Morocco was one of the worlds greatest exporters of space rocks.\n\nProf Hasnaa Chennaoui Aoudjehane has spent much of the past 25 years trying to hold on to some of that extraterrestrial material for her country.\n\nIts a part of us, its a part of our heritage its part of our identity and its important to be proud of the richness of the country, the geologist tells the BBC.\n\nThe professor is not against the trade in meteorites but has been instrumental in the introduction of measures aimed at regulating the business. She admits though that the new rules have not been entirely successful in stemming the flow of the meteorites.\n\nIn 2011, Prof Chennaoui was responsible for gathering material in the desert from an observed meteorite fall that turned out to be from Mars.\n\nLater named the Tissint meteorite, it weighed 7kg in all, but now she says only 30g remain in Morocco. Some of the rest is in museums around the world, with the biggest piece on display in Londons Natural History Museum.\n\nReflecting on the fate of Nigers Martian meteorite, she says she was not surprised as it is something that Im living with for 25 years. Its a pity, we cannot be happy with this, but its the same state in all our countries.\n\nProf Sereno hopes that the Sothebys sale will prove a turning-point  firstly by motivating the Nigerien authorities to act and secondly if it ever sees the light of day in a public museum, [the museum] is going to have to deal with the fact that Niger is openly contesting it.\n\n",

His comments were made as he discussed actions taken by the Patriotic Alliance against the podcast hosts.\n\nFollowing the backlash over the live video, McKenzies posts dating back from 2011 and 2013 were uncovered. These tweets contained apartheid-era racial slurs directed at black South Africans, and he criticised the term Black Diamond while using racially charged language widely considered reprehensible in South Africa.\n\nThe ATMfiled formal complaints with the Presidency, Parliament, and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Ethics and Members Interests. ATM Parliamentary leader Vuyo Zungula described the tweets as racially derogatory slurs that undermine democratic principles.\n\nZungula added that the language employs language steeped in historical racism, the same kind of degrading rhetoric used to strip black people of their humanity during apartheid and colonial eras.\n\nThe party demanded an urgent investigation and called for McKenzies removal, arguing that an unrepentant Minister cannot credibly lead a department tasked with building cultural bridges and fostering unity.\n\nActionSA also lodged a complaint with the SAHRC over McKenzies live video remarks andthe resurfaced tweets.\n\nActionSA Member of Parliament Alan Beesley emphasised the partys commitment to combating racism, stating: We are confronting racism in all its forms by holding a sitting Cabinet Minister accountable for comments that no reasonable person can defend as anything other than racist and demeaning.\n\nHe warned that if necessary, the matter would be escalated to the Equality Court under the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act.\n\nMcKenzie denied being racist, claiming the controversy was a politically motivated campaign orchestrated by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)and social media influencers. He admitted to the offensive posts but said they were written in response to racist remarks from others and expressed embarrassment over them.\n\nHe said, This whole campaign to find something racist I ever said is hilarious because you have now gone 13 years back and cant bring out one racist thing I ever said.\n\nThe Economic Freedom Fighters added their voice to calls from ATM and ActionSA, demanding McKenzies immediate removal from his ministerial position.\n\nMcKenzieannounced he would submit himself to an investigation.He said, I can never be guilty of racism, try some other take down but never racism.\n\nHe acknowledged tweeting some insensitive, stupid and hurtful things a decade or two ago, adding, I was a troll [and] stupid.I cringe when seeing them and I am truly sorry for that.\n\nHe denied any racist intent, citing his background: My mother was black and I have children with a black woman. I fought my whole life for the same treatment between black and Coloured people because we fought the same struggle.\n\nWhile McKenzie said he is truly sorry for the comments made years ago, a formal apology has not yet been issued.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com has invited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal) to discuss the National Gender Policy as a tool to assist women businesses participating in the formal market.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, this week we want to discuss the National Gender Policy. How far do you think Zimbabwe has proceeded so far to empower women from a gender perspective?\n\nVM: It is a difficult question for any man to respond to, however, I will list some of the legislative provisions that have been put in place to empower or allow women to have better opportunities, specifically, as it relates to their participation in the economy. Whether these policies are enough or sufficient, I am not qualified to respond.\n\nOur constitution, being the starting point and anchor guide to all our legislation and policies, require the State to promote the participation of women in all spheres of life, business being one of the spheres. To enable the participation of women in all spheres of life, our constitution therefore prohibits all forms of gender-based discrimination.\n\nTo this end, a notable number of our legislation is already aligned with the Constitution to reflect this objective. If we are look at some of our economic legislation, I will give one example, the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Act, it permits preferential treatment for targeted groups such as women led SMEs in bidding processes.\n\nReporter: How do cultural norms and some trade laws perpetuate the informality of women led businesses.\n\nVM: There are a variety of cultural and social issues that result in many women-led businesses being at the bottom end of the spectrum and operating informally. In most instances, women have the responsibility of the physical care of the family, limiting their ability to participate in riskier business ventures or those that require large start up or operating costs such as licencing fees or high rentals. A majority of the resultant business ventures that avoid high up front capital will be home based production businesses, small scale retail and vending.\n\nAlthough our laws void any law, custom or practice that may infringe on the rights of women, there is still need for general public education on the supremacy of our constitution over discriminatory customary practices.\n\nFurther, reforming and allowing local laws to be gender sensitive through gender responsive pricing of operating licences including the digitalization of informal businesses for purposes of incorporating them into the formal market where they can get equal access to finance and opportunities will go a long way.\n\nReporter: You mention digitalisation of informal businesses, how can fintech assist informal businesses to scale and formalise.\n\nVM: Pillar 3.3 of the National Gender Policy promotes women access to credit and technology. Such digital platforms like payment systems may be useful for recording cashflows and how well the small business is operating. This is the information that credit companies use when issuing credit. When such businesses operate outside a verifiable system, especially when such informal operators do not have other assets for collateral, it makes it difficult to measure capacity for business loans.\n\nCollecting gender data with systems that observe data protection for purposes of aligning with financial inclusion models is critical for purposes of growing informal businesses into formal scalable businesses.\n\nReporter: To what extent are our laws aligned to shift the economy from informality where women dominate to a tech anchored formal economy?\n\nVM: Pillar 3.3 of the National Gender policy as part of its priorities aims not only to empower women, but to do so through leveraging technology. AfCFTA and SADC frameworks promote cross border SME growth through tech. Although our laws are aligned to allow for the growth of SMEs through tech, what is required is intentionality in enforcement coupled with investment in digital infrastructure especially in our rural areas.\n\nReporter: In what ways are we able to ensure that the gender equality policy has been enforced?\n\nVM: In practical terms, gender equality policies or specific policies that promote the participation of women can only be enforced once they are incorporated in the various regulatory frameworks. A failure to do so is tantamount to breaching the Constitution of Zimbabwe. Our courts are open and available to assist victims alleging breach of gender laws and where its legislative, to compel the alignment of the various regulatory frameworks to the intentions of the constitution, which is to promote the participation of women in all spheres of life.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nThese discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima on vengai@mcmlegal.co.zw or at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

Going forward, similar exercises will be done regularly to assess the changes in the portfolio companies contribution to GDP, he said.The evaluation is part of the broader strategies to employ external checks and balances which strengthens public accountability and strong governance systems.In the 1990s, parastatals used to contribute a total 40% towards the GDP but over the years, the state enterprises contributions has waned significantly, prompting these entities to depend on the fiscus for survival.The coming on board of the MIF is widely seen as a positive step which will resuscitate the parastatals and align operations to profitability.Ncube said the Fund is also working with the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) on a variety of initiatives to address power shortages, which include enhancing base load, together with implementation of prepaid, net and smart metering projects.Based on the current and projected investments in the energy sector, the Fund is optimistic that load shedding will be significantly minimised in the outlook period, not least because of the rehabilitation of Hwange Units 1 to 6 under a Rehabilitate Operate and Transfer concession agreement between Zimbabwe Power Company and Jindal Africa, he added.\n\nAs Zimbabwes first Sovereign Wealth Fund, MIF is strategically positioned to leverage resources from the mining sector and other natural assets to stimulate long-term growth and development in the country.\n\nSince its establishment through the Sovereign Wealth Fund Act of 2014, and its subsequent renaming in September 2023 by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, MIF has set out to implement strategic initiatives aimed at revitalising struggling parastatals.Presenting the Mid Term Budget Review, Finance Minister, Mthuli Ncube said the MIF has engaged the ZIMSTAT for independent evaluation.Mutapa engaged the Zimbabwe Statistical Agency (ZIMSTAT) to conduct a survey to establish the contribution of its portfolio companies to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).ZIMSTAT concluded the survey in April 2025 and finalisation of the report is in process.
