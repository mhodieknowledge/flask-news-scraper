            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nOUTSPOKEN politician Temba Mliswa has denied allegations of luring Walter Mzembi back to Zimbabwe for incarceration, claiming the former cabinet minister was living in fear after a fallout with exiled ex-ZANU PF commissar Saviour Kasukuwere.\n\nMzembi returned to Zimbabwe after seven years of exile and has been in pretrial detention for violating his 2018 bail conditions.\n\nAt the centre of his return and subsequent arrest was allegedly Mliswa, an accusation which he denies.\n\nThe Mzembi issue is an unfortunate exhibition of callous politicians conveniently altering facts and pseudo-journalists crafting an alternative reality for excitable masses to imbibe on. Its a total shame to accuse me or anyone of enticing him back. This was his own idea, said Mliswa in a social media post.\n\nMliswa said the return of Mzembi was of his own volition due to fear of Kasukuwere after a fallout.\n\nThe facts are verifiable. There was never any CIO operation because Mzembi approached me as he wanted to return. One major reason is that he had split with Kasukuwere. For more than a year and half they have never spoke. He felt unsafe which is why he moved from SA to Zambia!\n\nAll this talk about me selling him out is noonday hogwash. Im no spy and never worked for CIO. Characters like Ali Naka, are merely (social media) guns for hire operating as Sekuru Tysons instruments. Ali is working for his food and will peddle any nonsense he is fed.\n\nInstead, they should admit how Mzembi was pushed back here due to fear of Kasukuwere as he no longer felt safe. He crafted his own idea, approached me to facilitate engagements with the relevant powers. Which I did. What part of those actions constitutes enticing him back? said Mliswa.\n\nThe alleged fallout between Kasukuwere and Mzembi comes as a surprise, as the two had been as thick as thieves and worked together during the 2023 election season.\n\nNow languishing in prison, Mzembi is reportedly ill as he awaits the commencement of his trial.\n\nI have always advocated for the return of everyone in exile. For both times involving Mzembi and Kasukuwere in 2018 when approached I simply spoke with the powers that be and facilitated engagements between the parties. Whatever else they agreed or didnt, I was never part of!\n\nAccusations of betrayal are outright fabrications by individuals like Ali Naka who are mere marionettes in this charade. Mzembi is not a victim of anything I did but of that which compelled him to flee from SA. Whatever agreements they spoke about back here I was never part of, added Mliswa.\n\n",

Razas previous best was the second position that he attained in December 2023.\n\nRazas aggregate of 151 runs also lifted him nine places to 22nd position in the batting rankings, which is two places off his career-best 24th position reached in June 2023. He has also gained one spot to reach 38th position among bowlers.\n\nSri Lanka opener Pathum Nissanka, who topped the aggregate with 198 runs to be named the Player of the Series, has moved up seven places to 13th position while Janith Liyanage (up 13 places to 29th) of Sri Lanka and Sean Williams of Zimbabwe (up three places to 47th) are others to move up the batting rankings after the series.\n\nScotland batter George Munsey is up three places to 34th after a match-winning 84 not out against Canada in the ICC Mens Cricket World Cup League 2 while South Africas Tony de Zorzi has moved from 67th to 64th.\n\nThe ODI bowling rankings see South Africa spinner Keshav Maharaj shake off Sri Lanka spinner Maheesh Theekshana to take the sole No. 1 position after a match-winning haul of four for 22 in the first ODI against England in Leeds with Jofra Archer (up six places to 19th) and Lungi Ngidi (up five places to joint-23rd) among the others to move up the bowling rankings after the match.\n\nAsitha Fernando has advanced six places to 31st while Dilshan Madushankas match-winning four for 62 in the first Harare ODI, that included a hat-trick, has lifted him from 60th to 52nd position.\n\nThe ICC Mens T20I Player Rankings see Afghanistan batters Ibrahim Zadran and Sediqullah Atal make huge progress after helping beat Pakistan in a tri-series match in Sharjah with scores of 65 and 64, respectively. Zadran is up 12 places to 20th while Atal has rocketed 346 places to 127th position.\n\nPakistan batters Hasan Nawaz (up two places to joint-31st) is among those to gain in the batting rankings while Sufiyan Muqeem (up 11 places to 22nd), Shaheen Afridi (up eight places to 26th and Mohammad Nawaz (up 15 places to 43rd) are among those to move up the bowling rankings.\n\nRazas upward movement may have resulted in Nabi slipping to third position in the ODI all-rounders list, but he has moved up one spot to second position among T20I all-rounders.\n\n",

This income stream is generated by fees for transactions such as withdrawals, transfers, currency exchanges, and card issuance, as well as commissions.\n\nPresenting the groups half-years performance this week, NMBZ CEO, Gerald Gore, said a total ZWG623,3 million was generated compared to ZWG383,6 million generated last year under the same revenue category.\n\nThis indicator confirms the earlier complaints by the banking public on the need for monetary authorities to prevent banks from charging high commission fees.\n\nHigh charges have been singled out for discouraging Zimbabweans from using formal banking services in favour of risky informal systems.\n\nA recent study by the National Economic Competitiveness Forum (NECF) also revealed that the cost of banking in Zimbabwe is a bit on the high side when compared to best practices.\n\nMeanwhile, during the period under review,the group operated profitably for the period under review, generating a comprehensive income of ZWG 98.9 million for the period compared to ZWG56,1 million for the prior comparative period.\n\nRestructuring expenses of ZWG138,5 million were incurred during the year, primarily related to a change in strategic focus towards a digital and more efficient operation. These costs include severance payments and other termination costs.\n\nTotal assets closed the period at ZWG7.8 billion, up 6% from ZWG7.4 billion as at 31 December 2024. The growth was largely funded by an increase in customer deposits. Loans and advances stood at ZWG3.4 billion as at 30 June 2025, up from ZWG2.9 billion as at 31 December 2024.\n\nThe growth was driven by the deployment of foreign lines of credit, largely to exporting companies. The groups focus remains on maintaining a robust credit risk management framework to ensure a sustainable quality portfolio.\n\n",
