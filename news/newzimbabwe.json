He is one of the clean artists whom Gvt should engage to advance the message against drug abuse.\n\nThe ruling party must work with him and one can imagine the impact of engaging him with Jah Prayzah in this campaign, said Mliswa.\n\nWinky D has never shied away from using music as a conduit for speaking truth to power and castigating social ills.\n\nMliswa further commended Winky D for remaining steadfast amid the onslaught from the government.\n\nIts now clear that in trying to fight him they have only managed to make him bigger. My only issue is that he should be more accessible. Otherwise, he has managed to weather attacks, remaining focused, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA New Years Day beer-drinking confrontation at Old Pumula Shopping Centre turned deadly when Thembelenkosini Mlotshwa fatally stabbed Khulekani Mjaho with an AK-47 press-button knife, an act the High Court ruled was deliberate and executed with actual intent to kill.\n\nJustice Ngoni Nduna, sitting at the Bulawayo High Court convicted Mlotshwa of murder with actual intent and sentenced him to 23 years in prison, ruling that his conduct was cold, callous and intentional.\n\nThe accused stabbed the deceased so heavily that the knife penetrated deeply into the body, Justice Nduna said. There can be no other conclusion which can be sustained on the facts of this case other than that the accused intentionally caused the death of the deceased.\n\nAccording to the court record, the fatal incident occurred on January 1, 2025, when both men were drinking beer at Old Pumula Shopping Centre in Bulawayo.\n\nWitnesses testified that after being struck with a plastic chair by the deceased during a confrontation, Mlotshwa pulled out a knife from his person and stabbed Mjaho once in the abdomen before fleeing the scene.\n\nMjaho later died in the hospital. The post-mortem report listed the cause of death as haemorrhagic shock, abdominal visceral injury, and callous stabbing.\n\nMlotshwa denied intending to kill, claiming the deceased was the aggressor who attacked him first and that the stabbing occurred accidentally as he tried to disarm Mjaho.\n\nBut the court dismissed his version as difficult to comprehend and inconsistent with the eyewitness accounts.\n\nThe witnesses observed the accused taking out the knife and stabbing the deceased before running away, the judge said. It was in the morning and visibility was very good such that the witnesses could not have been mistaken on what they saw.\n\nNduna said the nature and depth of the stab wound, and the fact that it was aimed at a vital organ, proved intent.\n\nIn pursuance of the assault, one stab wound was inflicted  the degree of force and depth of the wound was severe, he ruled. The accused deliberately aimed at that part of the body and fled the scene upon landing the knife. That shows his intention to achieve the death of the deceased.\n\nThe judge noted that Mlotshwa could not claim drunkenness as mitigation because the murder occurred early in the morning and there was no evidence he was intoxicated.\n\nIn imposing a 23-year prison term, Nduna said the crime was aggravated by the use of a weapon and by the fact that the victim was a young father of two.\n\nThe deceased had a wife and children who are now without a father, the judge said. There is nothing in the commission of the offence which invites the court to mercy. The accused was armed and ready to use the knife.\n\nWhile emphasising that punishment must be fair and just instead of savage or draconian, the judge said mercy could not outweigh the gravity of taking another life.\n\nIt must not be lost that another human being was killed, Nduna said. There, a sentence of 25 years would have been fair, but for the mitigation outlined above, 23 years imprisonment is just.\n\nThe murder weapon was forfeited to the State for destruction.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nZANU PFs Secretary for Legal Affairs, Ziyambi Ziyambi, has exposed how controversial businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei played a role in toppling longtime ruler Robert Mugabe by financially assisting the military in the November 2017 coup.\n\nZiyambi revealed in a recent ZANU PF politburo meeting that, at the request of the then Commander of the Defence Forces, Constantino Chiwenga, Tagwirei provided US$1.6 million, supplied fuel and catered for the soldiers basic provisions.\n\nThis was in response to a dossier submitted to the politburo by Chiwenga, in which he accuses a clique of businessmen, including Tagwirei, of capturing the ruling party and using it as a conduit for corruption.\n\nThere is no denying that Operation Restore Legacy had significant backing. A considerable amount of resources was invested to guarantee its success. It is unlikely that an operation of this scale could have achieved its goals without substantial financial support.\n\nFor the record Mr Kudakwashe Tagwirei put in a total of 5 million litres of fuel, food and other provisions for soldiers as requested by the then CDF, General Chiwenga. Furthermore, he put in one million litres of fuel and US$1.6 million to the Party.\n\nTherefore, the success of Operation Restore Legacy cannot be attributed to a few individuals. Any such assertions are aimed at distorting the historical narrative for personal and political gain, said Ziyambi.\n\nTagwirei, who is a benefactor of ZANU PF, has recently been accused of using his proximity to President Emmerson Mnangagwa to acquire government tenders.\n\nThe controversial entrepreneur has also been the subject of attacks by former ZANU PF member and fugitive Blessed Geza, who has accused him of capturing the state and perpetuating corruption.\n\nTagwirei has remained mum on the allegations of corruption.\n\nZiyambi said the removal of Mugabe was a collective effort, warning a clique backing Chiwenga to desist from claiming heroism.\n\nIt is denied that only a few individuals, particularly the writers of this document, sacrificed their lives for the attainment of Operation Restore Legacy. Zimbabweans from all walks of life rose and participated in and supported Operation Restore Legacy.\n\nLet us acknowledge the collective effort that made Operation Restore Legacy possible and desist from claiming heroism for work done by many, said Ziyambi.\n\n",
