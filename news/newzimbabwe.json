GG as he is notoriously called has accumulated more thanUS$1 billion becoming the richest civil servant, said Mutodi.\n\nContractors, Ministries and Departments refusing to pay Guvamatanga a kick back of at least 5% after receiving Treasury payments have been denied payments for several months even if the funds are budgeted for.\n\nOver the past six months, Parliament itself has struggled to operate after being denied its budgeted funds by George Guvamatanga. A civil servant earning less than $1000 GG has more than 5000 dairy cattle, dairy equipment and several mansions hence the proposed lifestyle audit.\n\nOnecontractor Bitumen which was contracted to do roads has been asked to pay US$200,000 byGuvamatangafor every $2,000,000 weekly payment he authorises that theyreceive and they have made several complaints tomembers of the Budget Committee at Parliament.\n\nGuvamatanga was earlier this year accused of receiving bribes from shadowy businessman Wicknel Chivayo to approve payments to the controversialRen-Form CC, a South African company that supplied Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) with voting material at highly inflated prices.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa is said to have fired and forgiven him in June this year before he begged for the job he has kept since 2018.\n\nAZanu PF Member of Parliament (MP) for Bikita South, Mutodiclaimed Guvamatanga had made threats to deal with him if the committee was to ever seek a lifestyle audit or engage the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC).\n\nHe added: Guvamatangahas also made threats to senda terror team to deal with the(me)upon hearing that the Committee was considering carrying out a life audit on him as well as asking for a ZACC probe.\n\n",
