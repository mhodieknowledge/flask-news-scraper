The directive given to the local authority is a direct attack on Section 276 of the Constitution, which enshrines devolution.\n\nIn fact, this entire land issue is an assault on devolution as provided for in Chapter 14 of the Constitution, particularly Sections 274 and 276. Local authorities must retain autonomy in decision-making, Akili told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nGovernment has been at loggerheads with Pinnacle Holdings over the land in Harare South which the latter claims ownership of.\n\nThe directive awaits approval from the local authority through a council resolution, which would facilitate the land transfer to Pinnacle Holdings.\n\nAkili further argued that the HCC should not be entangled in the dispute between the government and Pinnacle Holdings, as the council was not party to the original agreement.\n\nIt would be prudent for the local authority, particularly the councillors, to be guided by Chapter 14 of the Constitution on devolution.\n\nThe councillors must recognise that they cannot transfer any land to Pinnacle Holdings, which has no existing agreement with the City of Harare. In fact, Pinnacle Holdings has no locus standi in this matter, Akili said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) says a total 4 912 injuries and 76 fatalities were recorded in 2024, prompting calls for urgent combative measures.\n\nVarious factors, including human error, equipment malfunction, and environmental hazards, can contribute to workplace accidents.\n\nIn a speech read on behalf of the ZCTU President, Florence Taruvinga, to mark this years June 6 commemorations, the labour organ revealed that workplace injuries and fatalities rose significantly during the period.\n\nIn 2024, Zimbabwe experienced a concerning rise in occupational injuries and fatalities. It is reported that there were 4,912 injuries and 76 fatalities throughout the year. What about those accidents that went unreported? It is our demand that we cannot continue to suffer from workplace neglect as workers without the responsible authorities being brought to account for the injuries and deaths being experienced in the workplace, she said.\n\nTaruvinga said the mining industry has become synonymous with unsafe shafts, equipment failure, and weak regulations that are causing unnecessary deaths.\n\nIn Agriculture, she said, employees work without personal protective equipment and are exposed to chemicals, heat stress, and poor living conditions, while in the retail and commercial sectors, workers are exposed to long hours of work, job insecurity and poor ergonomics.\n\nTaruvinga said that in the informal sector, over 80% of workers operate with no safety laws, medical care, or recognisable rights, while the transport and manufacturing sectors have also not been spared, as workers work with very dangerous old and archaic machinery, poorly maintained and without proper safety nets.\n\nAs the voice of workers, we clearly pronounce that enough is enough. We demand the following: Full enforcement of OSH laws across all economic sectors, establishment of functional health and safety committees in every workplace and access to adequate PPE, occupational health training, and medicalservices for all workers, added Taruvinga.\n\nThe June 6 commemorations are held annually to reflect on the Kamandama Mine Disaster, in which 427 miners were killed in 1972 in a mine explosion. The accident, which was attributed to a methane gas explosion, forced the permanent closure of the mine.\n\n",

            "content": "ByLindaMujuruandGamuchiraiMasiyiwa,GPJZimbabwe\n\nThis story was originally published byGlobalPressJournal.\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  The vendors rarely see it coming. The municipal police, some in plainclothes and others in uniform, move through the crowd silent and unnoticed. When they finally strike, panic erupts. Vendors scatter, trampling their goods and grabbing what they can. A few are arrested. Their wares are seized and tossed into the back of a police truck.\n\nThey have no mercy at all. Once they take your stock, youll never get it back, says Saul Nhema, an informal vendor who has been selling vegetables for three months after losing his job as a construction worker.\n\nOn the day of this interview, the municipal police had already raided these informal vendors selling along Park Street in Harares central business district twice. As Global Press Journal reporters interviewed Nhema, they struck again. He grabbed his stock and fled in the middle of the interview.\n\nThe Harare City Council has for years waged such crackdowns on vendors, often destroying goods and deploying heavy police forces. Local government insists these crackdowns are necessary to enforce city bylaws, citing vending from illegal spots, littering and health concerns.\n\nYet the scale and intensity of recent operations, backed by expanding police presence and significant public spending, have raised questions. Critics argue that the government is wasting scarce resources targeting informal vendors all while it struggles to provide city residents with basic services, such as cleanwater.\n\nIn 2024, the councils revenue stood at just US$3 million. But policing costs for these crackdowns exceeded US$24 million, eight times the councils income.\n\nIn 2025, the council escalated its crackdown by creating a specialized police unit to target vendors, further deepening the financial strain with a slight budget increase  and pushing the total to around 12 times its income, which is projected to fall to just US$2 million.\n\nAs the councils income dwindles, the central government shoulders much of the financial burden.\n\nZvikomborero Guvheya serves customers while Saul Nhema arranges vegetables at their vending posts along a Harare sidewalk. Informal vendors like Guvheya and Nhema play a vital role in Zimbabwes struggling economy but face frequent raids, bribe demands and constant threats from municipal police crackdowns.

Photo Credit: Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nGlobal Press Journal made numerous requests for an interview with the mayor. He did not respond.\n\nThe additional cost of the special police unit is hard to justify, given the potential benefits of supporting informal vendors, says Reuben Akili, director of the Combined Harare Residents Association.\n\nIf we examine the funds allocated for enforcement covering salaries, fuel and operational costs, those resources could have been redirected toward rehabilitating markets or public restrooms in the city, Akili says.\n\nThe informal sector already sustains over 80% of Zimbabwes population and contributes nearly 72% to the countrys gross domestic product. Street vendors dominate the sector in many African countries, accounting for over 85% of jobs, many held by women.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the vendors are becoming increasingly critical, as the countrys currency crisis forces many retail shops to shut down.\n\nDespite this central role in many economies across the continent, vendors face common struggles. Many work in hostile, unregulated spaces, and they are routinely evicted under the pretext of urban order or dismissed as a threat to the health of formal economies.\n\nA special municipal police unit to push out this critical population in Harare will only inflate the citys workforce, which ultimately burdens taxpayers, Akili says. Instead, he says the council should build infrastructure where vendors can comfortably work.\n\nAn aerial view shows a municipal police truck carrying goods confiscated from vendors. Vendors who are arrested during crackdowns often lose their stock permanently, with little recourse to reclaim their goods.Photo credit: Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThere are some designated spaces within the central business district, but many vendors shun these, citing the high cost of renting stalls and a lack of foot traffic, which limits their ability to attract customers. Additionally, these spaces require a formal business license, which costs between US$400 and US$800 per year. In an economy that has struggled for decades, this cost is prohibitive for many.\n\nThe council must strike a balance between tackling these issues without undermining the livelihoods of those who depend on the informal economy, says Samuel Wadzai, director of Vendors Initiative for Social and Economic Transformation, a nonprofit that represents vendors.\n\nRaids havent been effective, he says, not even when a former minister of local government requested deployment of the army to push out vendors.\n\nDespite this central role in many economies across the continent, vendors face common struggles. Many work in hostile, unregulated spaces, and they are routinely evicted under the pretext of urban order or dismissed as a threat to the health of formal economies.\n\nDid that result in any significant change in terms of the challenges that we are seeing? I think its a big no, Wadzai says.\n\nAt times, vendors resort to bribing officers to avoid the disruption of evictions. Jesman Guvheya has worked as an informal vendor for two years. The widowed mother of five says the police sometimes demand US$1 a day from each vendor.\n\nBut there can be three or four groups that move at different times per day and you may end up paying 4 US dollars to avoid being raided, she says.\n\nAnd that bribe is never a guarantee one will trade without interruption. The police could swoop in and confiscate everything, even after a vendor has paid the bribe. Sometimes we are left with little stock that we will have secured elsewhere, she says, preparing to flee from police she has just spotted.\n\nAlthough Guvheya escaped arrest that day, her son, also a street vendor, wasnt as fortunate. The council police apprehended him, and she had to follow the truck to pay a bribe so he could be freed.\n\nLinda Mujuruis a Global Press Journal reporter-in-residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.\n\nGamuchirai Masiyiwais a Global Press Journal reporter-in-residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.\n\nGlobal Press Journal delivers bold, investigative and in-depth explanatory reporting on the worlds most urgent issues.\n\n",

He signed a similar order in 2017 during his first term in office.\n\nThe White House said these common sense restrictions would protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors.\n\nThere are a number of people from affected countries who may still be able to enter the US due to a number of exceptions.

The Times had no obvious motive to favor Livelys version of events.\n\nIn a statement shared with US media, Livelys lawyers called the opinion a total victory and a complete vindication for Blake Lively, along with those that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties dragged into their retaliatory lawsuit, including Ryan Reynolds, Leslie Sloane and The New York Times.\n\nAs we have said from day one, this $400 million lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it, her lawyers said.\n\nThe BBC has contacted Baldonis lawyers for comment.\n\nJudge Liman said Baldoni would be allowed to amend and refile his allegations related to interference with contracts by 23 June.\n\nJudge Limans dismissal comes a week after Lively asked to withdraw two of the claims in her suit against Baldoni  intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n\nIn the original lawsuit, she claimed she experienced severe emotional distress in response to the alleged sexual harassment and smear campaign.\n\nIt Ends With Us is an adaption of a best-selling Colleen Hoover novel, which features Blake Lively as the main character, Lily Bloom, a young woman who grew up witnessing domestic abuse and finds herself in the same position years later.\n\n",
