The potential buyer of the land, believed to be Collins Mnangagwa, is constructing a multi-storey building in the area and intends to close part of the public road.\n\nThe residents have been given a month to lodge objections and reasons with the City Council regarding the land.\n\nThe Highlands Residents Association has, via a petition, objected to the sale of the portion of the road by the City Council.\n\nWe, the undersigned residents and community members of Highlands and surrounding areas, hereby submit our formal objection to the proposed permanent road closure of a portion of Otto Road (i.e. Otto Drive, being the road connecting Willowmead Lane to Collins Avenue hereinafter referred to as Otto Road as per the public notice), Highlands, Harare, as advertised in the Public Notice placed in The Herald on Tuesday 2 September 2025, read the petition.\n\nThe residents lashed out at the City Council for the lack of transparency in the process, arguing that the sale of the land deprives the public of the benefits it carries.\n\nOtto Road is public land. Its permanent closure and subsequent sale would deprive current and future residents of their right to access and benefit from public infrastructure.\n\nOtto Road provides a safe and established route for domestic workers, security guards, gardeners, pedestrians, cyclists, schoolchildren, walkers and joggers. Closing it will force vulnerable users onto busier, more dangerous routes.\n\nMany people who rely on Otto Road do not own cars. Closure would disproportionately harm women, children, and low-income workers who depend on safe non-motorised routes.\n\nThe proposed closure appears to serve private interests at the expense of the broader community. Council has a duty to uphold transparency and protect public assets for collective benefit, read the petition.\n\n",

Something must have gone seriously wrong.\n\nOnias argued the property was a donation that could be revoked because Pride had become disrespectful and violent towards him, and had even tried to sell it against his wishes.\n\nBut the court ruled there was never a valid donation. There was never an intention to gratuitously and without obligation give the 1st respondent the property, Justice Muzofa said. There were strings attached. The applicant intended to continue to derive a benefit from the property.\n\nThe judge stressed that while Onias funded the purchase, the house was always registered in Prides name. The evidence before the Court strongly shows that the applicant purchased the property for the 1st respondent and he had strings attached, the judge said.\n\nDismissing the claim with costs, the judge concluded: Revocation can only be made where there is a valid donation.\n\n",
