            "content": "By DD News\n\nZIMBABWE has recorded a rise in AIDS-related deaths in the first half of this year, Health and Child Care Minister Douglas Mombeshora said on Friday.\n\nAddressing a media workshop on HIV reporting and stigma reduction in the capital Harare, Mombeshora stated that between January and June 2025, the country recorded 5,932 AIDS-related deaths, up from 5,712 during the same period last year.An increase of 220 deaths is a reminder that our work is not done, he said, without specifying the main cause behind the rise.The minister noted that while Zimbabwe has made significant strides in combating HIV/AIDS  particularly in achieving the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets  the gains remain fragile and are threatened by multiple challenges, including limited resources, stigma, and discrimination.As a nation, we must confront these realities with honesty and resolve. Addressing stigma and discrimination is not only a moral obligation; it is a public health imperative, he said.Zimbabwe is now seeking to transition to full domestic financing for its HIV and AIDS response amid declining external funding, Mombeshora said.During this transition, the country is facing difficulties in maintaining outreach staff and ensuring continuity of community-based services, according to a report by Xinhua.Operational adjustments are being made to safeguard service delivery, he added, stressing the need for innovation, stronger domestic partnerships, and a resilient, self-sustaining national response to the epidemic.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) attacks the bodys immune system, specifically the white blood cells, weakening the bodys defense against infections and diseases. If untreated, HIV can progress to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), the most advanced stage of the infection.HIV is transmitted through body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breast milk, and can also be passed from mother to child. It is not spread through casual contact like kissing, hugging, or sharing food.The disease can be prevented and managed through antiretroviral therapy (ART). Without treatment, HIV can take years to develop into AIDS.\n\nAddressing a media workshop on HIV reporting and stigma reduction in the capital Harare, Mombeshora stated that between January and June 2025, the country recorded 5,932 AIDS-related deaths, up from 5,712 during the same period last year.\n\nAn increase of 220 deaths is a reminder that our work is not done, he said, without specifying the main cause behind the rise.The minister noted that while Zimbabwe has made significant strides in combating HIV/AIDS  particularly in achieving the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets  the gains remain fragile and are threatened by multiple challenges, including limited resources, stigma, and discrimination.As a nation, we must confront these realities with honesty and resolve.

The teenager struck Brian Bennet flush on the helmet, which forced the Zimbabwean opener to retire hurt with concussion on 19. Prince Masvaure was the concussion substitute.Maphaka also struck Williams with a searing bouncer, but the veteran brushed it off to continue his fine innings.The left-hander was much more fluent against the spin of Keshav Maharaj, often skipping down the pitch to dispatch the Proteas stand-in skipper over midwicket.His celebration upon reaching three-figures was particularly special with Williams screaming in delight and punching the air.Unfortunately for Williams, and Zimbabwe, he did not have much support apart from skipper Craig Ervines 36 with allrounder Wiaan Mulder running through the middle-order with figures of 4/50.Ervine was Maharajs 200th Test victim.Maharaj had the last laugh, though, with the wily left-arm spinner flummoxing Williams with a well-flight delivery. With Williams stretching forward, and missing the delivery, it proved Proteas wicket-keeper Kyle Verreynne to whip off the bails in a flash to bring about the end of a wonderful innings by the hometown hero.Yusuf chipped in with a further wicket towards the end before Maharal also picked up his third of the innings as Zimbabwe were bowled out for 251  a deficit of 167.The Proteas innings once again started poorly with Matthew Breetzke edging Tanaka Chivanga early on, but Tony de Zorzi and Mulder ensured there were no more further alarms as the Proteas built their lead to 216 runs by stumps.First Test, Day 2, StumpsSouth Africa: 418/9 & 49/1 (De Zorzi 22*, Mulder 25*, Chivanga 1/18)Zimbabwe: 251 (Williams 137, Mulder 4/50, Yusuf 3/42, Maharaj 3/70)South Africa lead by 216 runs.\n\nWilliams 137 was the mainstay of Zimbabwes 251 after the Proteas declared on their overnight 418/9.\n\nThe 38-year-old battled through the initial new-ball onslaught after debutant Codi Yusuf picked up his maiden Test wicket in his first over before following it up with another a couple of overs later.Kwena Maphaka may not have tasted success, but the teenager built up a good head of steam.

late strike by Salif Cheya in the 87th minute was all Lloyd Mutasas side needed to walk away with three points.So important was the win for MWOS that it leapfrogged Simba Bhora, who played a 1-1 draw against FC Platinum at Mandava Stadium Saturday.MWOS is now on 37 points, one ahead of Simba Bhora who are second.Meanwhile, at Rufaro Stadium Rodwell Dhlakamas Green Fuel held CAPS United to a nill all draw.Sundays match was the first for Dhlakama, who was appointed on Wednesday last week by the club.For Dhlakama walking away with a point from Rufaro Stadium is confidence booster for his team which has been struggling for consistency before his arrival.For me its a massive result, the confidence of the boys had gone down after last weeks heavy defeat to Triangle.So a draw against a big team like CAPS United will boost the morale, he said.On the other end CAPS United coach Ian Bakala was not happy with the result as stating that his side did not play the way he had planned.We did not perform the way we wanted, but a point is much better looking at where we are.So, for now we just have to take this and focus on the coming game, he said.After Sundays match CAPS United moved to position 11 on the log with 20 points, the same with Green Fuel who are on position 12.In other league match played at Gibbo Stadium, Scottland FC recorded a 0-0 draw against relegation threatened

In an apparent sign of a shake-up backstage, the schedule was changed last-minute, according to the original lineup, Enzo Ishall was supposed to close the show early Sunday morning.\n\nNasha Ts, who had been expected to perform earlier, was slotted in at midnight. The Zimdancehall musician appeared to have forced her way onstage, with faint sound, delays and technical mishap, frustrating Tinashe Mutarisi, who was visibly irritated and animated onstage.\n\nThe backstage politics, delays, and chaotic organisation marred the concert. However, gloss could not be taken way from Freeman, Master H, and Killer T, who delivered solid performances.\n\nOnce the performances got underway, numbers gradually grew at the HICC, a significant reason for the young musicians to hold their heads high as they dared to challenge their limits.\n\n",
