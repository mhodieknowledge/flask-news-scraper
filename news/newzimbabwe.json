Johnston Busingye,\n\nRwandas High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, H.E. Johnston Busingye\n\nchallenged Africans to commit ourselves to making a difference.\n\nThe Africa we want is within reach, but getting there requires governments that match policy with implementation, businesses that take bold steps, and partners who are willing to build lasting and productive relationships.\n\nMeanwhile, founded 14 years ago,Diaspora Insurancehas enjoyed phenomenal growth, developing into a multi-million-dollar business from its global headquarters in Birmingham.\n\nFrom covering just two countries when it was founded, the company now covers 20 African nationalities not just in the UK and Europe but right across the world.\n\nWhen we started, we did say we can only call ourselves a civilised people when we are able to create common solutions for our common good, said Madzingo.\n\nWe were coming from a background where every time there is a bereavement, it comes with a begging bowl, and we needed to arrest that challenge.\n\nDiaspora Insurancechanged the traditional services-based approach to funeral insurance, introducing products more suited to the unique needs of African diasporas.\n\nThe companysfuneral cash planprovides immediate cash intervention to ensure families are not subjected to the double trauma and indignity of grieving and begging at the same time.\n\nMadzingo also shared insights on challenges which face African entrepreneurs in the UK, including poor access to capital, lack of professional support and limited networks, limited experience in top executive roles.\n\nOther drawbacks include a consumer rather than producer mindset that we come with as African entrepreneurs, said Madzingo, adding that we also tend to focus on businesses that are very difficult to scale up.\n\nAwards host, theAfrican Business Chamber (AfBC), is a global organisation dedicated to representing and supporting African businesses, investors, and entrepreneurs as they grow and thrive in the global economy.\n\nChamber CEO Eugene Nizeyimana said the organisation was eight years ago to enhance our representation in the UK economy, enhance our voice, and establish businesses that create jobs and wealth.\n\nSecondly, we want to drive investment between the UK and Africa, make sure that all of us, as we live in the UK we also contribute back, engage back and invest back in Africa.\n\nTop 100 Business Leader of the Year:Said ADREN\n\nBusiness Excellence Award:Edward Obi Chartered FCIPD, MIRP, TechIOSH\n\nEntrepreneur of the Year:Cody Gapare (CMgr MCMI MBA)\n\nStartup and New Business of the Year Award:Michaelle Kubwimana\n\nTechnology and Innovation Excellence Award:Olusola (Sola) Idowu\n\nHealthcare Excellence Award:Professor Rotimi Jaiyesimi\n\nCreative Industry Excellence Award:Juliana Olayinka\n\nFinancial Services Excellence Award:Jeff Madzingo\n\nProfessional Services Excellence Award:Leslie Owusu\n\nWomen in Business (WIB) Excellence Award:Fungai Ndemera\n\nInternational Trade Excellence Award:Veronica Bolton Smith\n\nSocial Enterprise Excellence Award:Leah Chikamba-Mulando\n\nDiaspora Excellence Award:Jabo Butera\n\nBusiness of the Year Award:Bank Of Africa UK\n\n",

She took over as mayor of the Berkshire city in May this year, having served four years as a councillor for Whitley Ward.\n\nThis is a huge achievement, not just for yourself but for us as a people and, more importantly, for our children, said Madzingo whosecompanysupported the hosting of the event.\n\nGone are the days when our children grew up without role models and thought that the barriers are too high for them. Your election is evidence that it can be done.\n\nDiaspora Insurance CEO Jeff Madzingo\n\nMadzingoadded; Honourable mayor, we cant salute you enough for doing this because, over the years, the story has been about negativity and poverty, but we are now changing the narrative to a story of resilience and a story of excellence.\n\nBeing mayor in a foreign country is not a joke but success is not accidental; its a culmination of good habits, hard work, professionalism and time management.\n\nDr Mpofu-Coles recounted what she described as a tough journey since relocating to the United Kingdom in 2002 from Zimbabwe and surviving a five-year battle against breast cancer.\n\nIm overwhelmed, she said before kneeling and clapping her hands in appreciation in the traditional Zimbabwean way.\n\nI arrived in the UK in 2002 and thought I would go back to Zimbabwe and become a member of Parliament for the then MDC (party). We were really passionate about Zimbabwe and campaigned right across the country.\n\nShe added, Its been tough; I had breast cancer or five years, and, in that time, I couldnt do anything, but this city of Reading carried me. It was amazing having people care for you.\n\nDr Mpofu-Coles was described as a poster girl of the idea that if I make it, Ill always turn back to pull my sister out too; I wouldnt just walk away.\n\nA former diplomat who served in Zimbabwes foreign service with postings in Mozambique and the former Yugoslavia Dr Mpofu-Coles brings a remarkable personal journey to her mayoral role.\n\nAfter arriving in Reading in 2002 as a refugee she had to rebuild her life in the UK, working hard in a sandwich factory, as a cleaner, a carer for the elderly and disabled, then qualified as social worker, before studying for a doctorate in Human Geography at the University of Reading and building a career in academia.\n\nHaving been supported by Reading Refugee Support Group herself, she became the Chair of the charity and has dedicated her time to advocate for refugees now as a trustee of City of Sanctuary.\n\nAs a Reading councillor, Dr Mpofu-Coles has chaired the Adult Social Care, Childrens Services and Education Committee, and sits on the Parenting Panel, Health and Wellbeing Board and Safer Reading Neighbourhood Forum, among others.\n\nA strong advocate or refugees and fighter against inequalities and poverty, Dr Mpofu-Coles chosen charities for her mayoral year are ReadiFood, a local foodbank service, and Utulivu Womens group, which supports equal opportunities for BAME and refugee women and girls.\n\n",
