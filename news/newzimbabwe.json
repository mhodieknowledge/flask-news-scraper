            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTOP beverages manufacturer, Delta Corporation Limited has commended the stable ZWG local unit four spurring sales volumes across the group.\n\nThe ZWG currency has sustained stability for most part of 2025, sustaining an exchange rate premium of US$1:ZWG27 since its last major depreciation in September 2024. The conditions have necessitated a tight monetary policy stance and a commitment to maintain the grip on money supply.Presenting the groups performance for the half years period ended September 30 2025, Delta board chairman, Todd Moyo acknowledged the positive impact of stable exchange rates on product sales.The Group benefited from a relatively stable operating environment during the half-year period under review. Consumer spending remained strong, driven by a stable ZWG exchange rate, the record-breaking tobacco marketing season, increased mining activities and the firm mineral prices, particularly gold.Diaspora remittances are also benefiting from the firming of cross exchange rates such as the Rand and Pound, our key source markets, he said.During the period, group revenue for the half year at US$514 million increased by 32% compared to the prior year, reflecting volume growth across the Zimbabwe business units and the inclusion of Schweppes as a subsidiary.The revenue growth was weighed down by the price moderations in the Sparkling Beverages business, which partly absorbed the sugar tax to maintain volume and competitiveness. The proportion of domestic sales undertaken in foreign currency was 92% during the period under review.Moyo said the Zimbabwe Gold (ZWG), was relatively stable during the half year, reducing the level of rate estimation for compliance with IFRS and IAS 21. The rates used at the reporting date were within the ranges allowed by the monetary regulations.Profit After Tax (PAT) surged by nearly 83% to US$75,05 million for the six months ended September 30, 2025, largely driven by robust revenue growth of 32% and a sharp decline in exchange losses.Lager beer volumes rose 21%, supported by stronger consumer incomes and stable pricing.The sorghum beer category expanded 16%, buoyed by firm demand from mining communities and commercial agriculture, while sparkling beverages registered an 11% increase, reflecting modest recovery amid sugar tax pressures.Delta subsidiary, African Distillers Limited, delivered the strongest outturn, with overall volumes up 43%led by wine (59%), ready-to-drink beverages (47%) and spirits (36%).\n\nThe ZWG currency has sustained stability for most part of 2025, sustaining an exchange rate premium of US$1:ZWG27 since its last major depreciation in September 2024.

            "content": "By Fadzai Chipato, The Conversation\n\nCarbon offsetsare a way for companies or countries that pollute the air to cancel out some of their carbon emissions by funding projects that protect forests, plant trees, or provide clean energy  sometimes on the other side of the world. Polluting companies in the US, Europe, Asia or elsewhere can buy onecarbon creditfrom a green project anywhere in exchange for emitting one metric tonne of carbon dioxide (CO). But do these projects benefit the African countries that host them? Rural development researcher Fadzai Chipato studied two carbon offset projects in Zimbabwe.Her research foundthat these projects can negatively affect local communities.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, carbon offsetting began around 2011 with theKariba REDD+(reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries) project.\n\nIt was run by a Zimbabwean company,Carbon Green Africa, which leased 758,000 hectares of degraded forest from four local councils in northern Zimbabwe where forest could be regrown for the purpose of selling carbon credits.\n\nThe company aimed to work with local communities to halt deforestation throughconservation farming protecting the soil by not digging in it and planting a variety of crops. They also funded nutrition gardens and beekeeping projects, and providedbiogas digestersand fuel-efficient stoves to reduce the number of trees cut down for firewood.\n\nMany families benefited through food, education, and extra income. However, the projects were run from the top down. Decisions were made by investors, the government, and rural district councils. Local villagers had very little say.\n\nIn 2023, Zimbabwe passed anew carbon trading law. This required all carbon projects to be registered withthe governmentand pay 30% of revenues to the state. TheKariba REDD+was stopped, leaving villagersunsurewhether their gardens, beekeeping, and clean energy projects would continue.\n\nThe second project I studied is theCicada Holdings Project, which aimed to plant 100 million indigenous trees over 30 years and give out 120,000 cookstoves that use less firewood.\n\nUnlike Kariba, Cicada worked more closely with local farmers and by December 2025, it had given out 160,000 environmentally friendly stoves. However, it was also slowed down by the new law, with the government taking more than 18 months to process new registrations.\n\nOn the positive side,the Kariba projectset up 24 community gardens, including seven school gardens, that provided 3,000 people directly or indirectly with food. One garden generated enough income to support 10 orphans.\n\nThe community gardens have improved my familys quality of life. I managed to pay my daughters school fees and buy household supplies.\n\nNewconservation farmingmethods were introduced. Maize, and two nutritious crops that are fairly drought resistant  sorghum and millet  were grown. Beekeeping in the forests was also introduced. As farmers said:\n\nWe learned about innovative agriculture practices to improve our yields, which were low due to the low rainfall. We now experience better harvests, improving our food sustenance and even selling excess crops, generating financial income.\n\nBeyond forest preservation, beekeeping provides additional income for farmers and serves as a rich source of food for humans, thereby improving community livelihoods.\n\nThe Kariba REDD+ project also builtbiogas digestersat hospitals to generate clean energy from dung. Local villagers could sell cattle dung to these projects in exchange for medical treatments and cash.\n\nCicadas clean cookstoves reduced smoke-related illnesses and had other benefits:\n\nThe stoves are very helpful; we are no longer collecting firewood, which was getting difficult to find.\n\nOn the other hand,my research revealedthat many communities were excluded from decision-making. Some only found out about projects in their villages through the media. Local politicians were also unhappy when projects were put on ice after the new law introduced stringent registration requirements:\n\nWe were shocked when the project was stopped, saying the government was not involved. We asked ourselves, arent Rural District Councils part of the government?\n\nA further problem was that project funds went through many intermediary brokers, councils and non-governmental organisations. Villagers never knew how much money the carbon credits were generating or how it was spent. This lack of transparency caused mistrust.\n\nOverall,my research found thatcarbon offsets in Zimbabwe have not been neutral tools. They are political and economic processes that reshape who controls land, who benefits, and who is left out. Because they restrict traditional access to forests, firewood and grazing land, these projects create virtual dispossession.\n\nFor example, people were stopped from collecting firewood, grazing cattle, or making bricks in forest areas that had always been communal land. Women and youth who earned a living from the forests were badly affected by having fewer rights to use their land.\n\nThismirrorswider patterns across Africa, where communal land that supports households is redefined as underutilised and given over global carbon markets, often without fair consultation with the people using the land.\n\nTo make carbon offsetting fairer in Zimbabwe and the global south, several measures are needed:\n\nWithout these changes, carbon offsetting risks becoming another form of green grabbing that takes land and resources from Indigenous people who have used them for centuries in the name of climate change adaptation.\n\nLecturer in the Department of Sociology and Social Anthropology, Great Zimbabwe University\n\nThis article was originally published byThe Conversation.\n\n",
