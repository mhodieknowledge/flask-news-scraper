            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nAfricas richest man, Aliko Dangote, has announced plans to invest over US$1 billion in Zimbabwe, saying he is confident in the countrys renewed transparency and improved business climate,a sharp contrast to his first experience in 2015 when proposed deals collapsed amid bureaucracy and corruption.\n\nDuring his 2015 visit, the Dangote Group founder and CEO met then-President Robert Mugabe and expressed interest in developing the Sengwa coal fields and constructing a 2,800MW coal-fired power plant. However, the projects failed to take off after frustrations over red tape and alleged demands for kickbacks from officials.\n\nAt the time, investors were not allowed to charge for electricity in foreign currency, and Dangotes proposal hinged on cost-reflective tariffs in U.S. dollars. The situation has since changed, with the government now permitting independent power producers to set tariffs and repatriate profits.\n\nFollowing a meeting with President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Wednesday, Dangote announced that his conglomerate would roll out new projects in cement production, power generation, and a fuel pipeline.\n\nThe government views the planned investment as part of its broader effort to industrialise the economy, add value to local resources and create employment.\n\nDangote Industries Limited, one of Africas largest conglomerates, operates across multiple sectors, including cement, sugar, oil refining, and fertilizer production. Its expansion into southern Africa could position Zimbabwe as a strategic link in a regional oil and fertilizer supply network connected through Namibias Walvis Bay.\n\nAsked why he decided to return after nearly a decade, Dangote said:There is a lot of change between that time when we came and right now,its solid. There is a lot of transparency. When you look at what His Excellency President Emmerson Mnangagwa has done in terms of turning the economy around, that is what gave us the confidence to say, This is the right time to come and invest. Its like someone has passed an exam,people have to give him a good mark.\n\nHe confirmed that an agreement had been signed between Zimbabwe and the Dangote Group covering several sectors:\n\nSome of our investments will be in cement manufacturing, power generation, and the supply of petroleum products. We are also in the business of producing petroleum; we have one of the largest refineries in the world, he said.\n\nDangote added that while the investment package is broad, further details on specific figures and timelines would be shared as implementation progresses.\n\n",

We clearly told them we were simply conducting ZINASU campaigns, which had nothing to do with ZANU PF.\n\nDear Mr MnangagwaThis is why this evil must be fought for as long as is necessary, . even for the rest of our lives or with our own lives.

Mr Mnangagwa, why should this not worry or concern you? Mugabe was bad. This is worse. So barbaric. This is pure evil!\n\nMeanwhile, human rights organisation Amnesty International has called for a thorough investigation into the attack and urged authorities to protect students rights to peaceful assembly and association.\n\nThese attacks threaten not just freedoms of assembly, expression, and association, but also the rights to education, non-discrimination, academic freedom, and participation in university public life.\n\nWe urge the authorities to thoroughly investigate these attacks and ensure that students can exercise their freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without fear of reprisals, intimidation, or torture, Amnesty International said in a statement.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. This mens month, we want to discuss a topical issue among men, which is, how do you ensure that your business or wealth is grown from one generation to the next and not wasted?\n\nVM: It is a great question, I believe it is one that vexes the minds of a lot of men.\n\nHaving worked so hard to grow personal wealth, in some instances in classic rags-to-riches fashion, how does one ensure that the wealth is not dissipated by the next generation? Zimbabwe is rife with stories of men who achieved unimaginable wealth within their lifetimes, which is lost completely by the first generation of beneficiaries.\n\nThis is deeply disconcerting.\n\nOne can only mitigate against this eventuality and it cannot be through legal protections only, although they are quite useful. There is a need for training or a meeting of minds between the benefactor and potential beneficiary; otherwise, leaving money or wealth without the wisdom to maintain and grow it is similar to throwing it in a deep dark hole.\n\nSome families go to the extent of having a family constitution that guides issues to do with succession, how people are cared for by the business of the familyetc,outside of the other protective mechanisms available in law.\n\nAlthough such protective mechanisms are noble, they are supposed to be implemented while considering existing and future disruptive technologies and the evolving nature of businesses. It is therefore my considered view that at the cornerstone of whatever protective mechanism in law is put in place, the family must have a common vision that guides it, which vision is bigger than individual avarices.\n\nThis, when achieved, may retain and even grow the family wealth.\n\nIf I were to use a local example, the rural home kumusha does not belong to anyone through title; each custodian has a duty to maintain and improve it for the benefit of the next generation. That must be, in my view, how generational wealth is created, through compounding.\n\nReporter:I am convinced by your proposition. What legal protections would complement this?\n\nVM: Having addressed the soft laws within the family, being the family visionet cetera, the next question is how the benefactor codifies this vision so that it becomes binding. The first step is to ensure that the companies holding the businesses have articles of association and shareholder agreements that speak to some of the protective clauses required for the envisioned continuity.\n\nYou will be surprised by the number of people who have generic articles of association or shareholder agreements that do not speak specifically to their intended posterity. The omission is staggering as these documents define types of shares, voting rights, how shares are transferred and to whom, decision-making protocols, dispute resolution mechanisms and even governing structures.\n\nReporter: I had not imagined the importance of personalising these company documents!\n\nVM: Indeed, you are one of many.\n\nThe company documents are the first layer of protection. Although they may be protective from a legacy perspective, they must be fluid enough to evolve.\n\nThe next layer will be to create a family trust which is tailored to the familys specific goals and idiosyncrasies. Trusts are flexible and should be customised. The shares of the business, properties and other family investments may be housed in the trust, which ultimately becomes the family constitution prescribing how the family assets should be protected, whether through either majority votes when disposing assets or unanimous votes.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, life policies are housed in trusts and loans are taken out against them for daily business.\n\nThere are other benefits that come with setting up the trust, such as easier succession, as it is dealt with within the document, resulting in cheaper probate or estate duties.\n\nReporter: I think that is very clear. Are there any other protections available to safeguard the businesses and wealth?\n\nVM: Well, I think the role of intellectual property protections is understated in Zimbabwe. It is my belief that more businesses should register their trademarks to protect them from eleventh-hour businesses that want to benefit from the established goodwill.\n\nLastly, keeping records is key even to understanding the intentions of the benefactors or proprietors. I think an unnecessary number of businesses fail to keep a proper record of their statutory and operational documents, for example, their standard operating procedures. These documents are useful in understanding how the business navigated certain situations.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have to end here, because of our time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

They need adequate resources to complete the ongoing road projects. The Ministry is doing a commendable job, and we are seeing progress across the country.

Lets ensure those targets are met. Delivering on time will strengthen our case when we lobby for bigger allocations.

This season, we wanted to bring art closer to everyoneonline and in personbecause art unites us. It transcends borders and, like the holidays, invites warmth and shared humanity.\n\nFrom realistic canvases by Nokuthula Mpofu and otherworldly portraits by Florah Maphosa to photorealistic drawings by Willard Mujuru and fantastical scenes painted by Keith Zenda, the exhibition traverses subject and medium to bring to life a comprehensive artistic world of possibility.\n\n",
