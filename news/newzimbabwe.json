            "content": "By lOL\n\nTHE Proteas assumed control of the first Test on the second day in Bulawayo, despite a marvellous century from Zimbabwean veteran Sean Williams at the Queens Sports Club.\n\nWilliams 137 was the mainstay of Zimbabwes 251 after the Proteas declared on their overnight 418/9.The 38-year-old battled through the initial new-ball onslaught after debutant Codi Yusuf picked up his maiden Test wicket in his first over before following it up with another a couple of overs later.Kwena Maphaka may not have tasted success, but the teenager built up a good head of steam. The teenager struck Brian Bennet flush on the helmet, which forced the Zimbabwean opener to retire hurt with concussion on 19. Prince Masvaure was the concussion substitute.Maphaka also struck Williams with a searing bouncer, but the veteran brushed it off to continue his fine innings.The left-hander was much more fluent against the spin of Keshav Maharaj, often skipping down the pitch to dispatch the Proteas stand-in skipper over midwicket.His celebration upon reaching three-figures was particularly special with Williams screaming in delight and punching the air.Unfortunately for Williams, and Zimbabwe, he did not have much support apart from skipper Craig Ervines 36 with allrounder Wiaan Mulder running through the middle-order with figures of 4/50.Ervine was Maharajs 200th Test victim.Maharaj had the last laugh, though, with the wily left-arm spinner flummoxing Williams with a well-flight delivery. With Williams stretching forward, and missing the delivery, it proved Proteas wicket-keeper Kyle Verreynne to whip off the bails in a flash to bring about the end of a wonderful innings by the hometown hero.Yusuf chipped in with a further wicket towards the end before Maharal also picked up his third of the innings as Zimbabwe were bowled out for 251  a deficit of 167.The Proteas innings once again started poorly with Matthew Breetzke edging Tanaka Chivanga early on, but Tony de Zorzi and Mulder ensured there were no more further alarms as the Proteas built their lead to 216 runs by stumps.First Test, Day 2, StumpsSouth Africa: 418/9 & 49/1 (De Zorzi 22*, Mulder 25*, Chivanga 1/18)Zimbabwe: 251 (Williams 137, Mulder 4/50, Yusuf 3/42, Maharaj 3/70)South Africa lead by 216 runs.\n\nWilliams 137 was the mainstay of Zimbabwes 251 after the Proteas declared on their overnight 418/9.\n\nThe 38-year-old battled through the initial new-ball onslaught after debutant Codi Yusuf picked up his maiden Test wicket in his first over before following it up with another a couple of overs later.Kwena Maphaka may not have tasted success, but the teenager built up a good head of steam.

late strike by Salif Cheya in the 87th minute was all Lloyd Mutasas side needed to walk away with three points.So important was the win for MWOS that it leapfrogged Simba Bhora, who played a 1-1 draw against FC Platinum at Mandava Stadium Saturday.MWOS is now on 37 points, one ahead of Simba Bhora who are second.Meanwhile, at Rufaro Stadium Rodwell Dhlakamas Green Fuel held CAPS United to a nill all draw.Sundays match was the first for Dhlakama, who was appointed on Wednesday last week by the club.For Dhlakama walking away with a point from Rufaro Stadium is confidence booster for his team which has been struggling for consistency before his arrival.For me its a massive result, the confidence of the boys had gone down after last weeks heavy defeat to Triangle.So a draw against a big team like CAPS United will boost the morale, he said.On the other end CAPS United coach Ian Bakala was not happy with the result as stating that his side did not play the way he had planned.We did not perform the way we wanted, but a point is much better looking at where we are.So, for now we just have to take this and focus on the coming game, he said.After Sundays match CAPS United moved to position 11 on the log with 20 points, the same with Green Fuel who are on position 12.In other league match played at Gibbo Stadium, Scottland FC recorded a 0-0 draw against relegation threatened

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nAN economic analyst has urged the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) to be cautious following the decision to halt the sale of gold coins.\n\nIn a statement, RBZ governor Dr John Mushayavanhu informed members of the public that the mop up sale of gold coins had been suspended, with immediate effect, following the successful completion of the exercise.\n\nThe RBZ would like to clarify that this was a sale meant to clear remaining stock and not the minting of new gold coins which had been suspended in April 2024.The latest round of gold coin sales also included coins redeemed by holders, he said.\n\nThe central bank exchequer advised members of the public that future gold coin sales will be undertaken upon accumulation of a sizable quantity from redemptions with gold coins in the market remaining tradable and redeemable.\n\nThe gold coins were introduced by the RBZ in 2022 as an investment avenue for holders of excess local currency, who could easily purchase the bullion coins to store value.\n\nAgainst the backdrop, a respected economist who preferred anonymity warned the RBZ against the decision to block the sale of gold coins arguing the decision exposes the local currency to inflationary pressure.\n\nThese coins eased pressures from the market because they provided a valve to a safe investment instrument. Upon their introduction, several companies avoided flooding the parallel exchange market to pursue the local currency and in a way this maximized currency stability. The RBZ just has to be very careful because apart from sustaining tight liquidity, they have few options in place in the event of shifting such a policy stance, he said.\n\nThe economist said the possibility of loosening the grip on liquidity is very high considering the current pressures mounting from industry which leaves the ZWG currency vulnerable.\n\nSo at some point we are likely to see companies and other individual holders of excess ZWG flooding the foreign exchange market in search of the greenback and such a scenario is very dangerous, he said.\n\nAs at February 2023, gold coins worth ZW$20 billion had been sold with the bulk being snapped up by corporates, in the process contributing towards mopping up of excess liquidity.\n\nIn the same year, several companies and the Insurance Pension Fund (IPEC) reported that gold coins were seen as an investment opportunity by several pension funds which spent ZW$2,29 billion purchasing the investment instruments.\n\nIn the same year, several companies and the Insurance Pension Fund (IPEC) reported that gold coins were seen as an investment opportunity by several pension funds which spent ZW$2,29 billion purchasing the investment instruments.\n\n",

Night roadblocks and motorised patrols will continue to be carried out throughout the country including highways, said the Home Affairs secretary.\n\nAmong most targeted offenders are pirate taxis colloquially known as mushikashikas, commuter omnibuses and conventional buses, which are causing mayhem in the countrys cities and towns resulting in fatal road accidents.\n\nAlso, the system will target members of the public who cross the streets without following road traffic lights (robots) or pedestrian crossings (jaywalking)\n\nJaywalking will attract a fine, according to Ambassador Faranisi.\n\nDue to the complexity of the system, the police cannot sorely rely on ZINARA or VID infrastructure.\n\nCurrently, the ZRP is leveraging on ZINARA database to track vehicle owners whose vehicles are captured on cameras flouting road rules and regulations in Harare and Bulawayo Central Business Districts (CBD), Faranisi told the committee chaired MP Tawanda Karikoga.\n\n",
