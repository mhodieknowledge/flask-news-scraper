The Mines Ministryand the client were saying, okay, we will not do the 16 hectares, allow us to do one hectare, she told the Parly committee.\n\nShe continued: We do not understand why these applications are being entertained with a similar problem for Matopos, one of our flagships.\n\nWe received hundreds of complaints and petitions from all over the world, from embassies, but we seem not to really have that much value for conservation.\n\nBut we know that conservation, if we look after our animals, if we look after our areas, we have the potential to generate more money. Conservation preserves the environment and generations will continue to come and see these areas.\n\nMutyambizi, however, highlighted that there was conflicting legislation on mining and conservation in Zimbabwe, making it difficult to take full control of the protected areas.\n\nWe do have a serious problem but as ZimParks, all we can do is to try and use our own legislation, but we have got conflicting legislation that is also coming into our areas.\n\n",

The moment you start moving, it will draw their attention, the guide explained, highlighting the rhinos unique physical characteristics.\n\nThis encounter encapsulated both the allure and the dangers of wildlife safari camping.\n\nThough rhinos are generally non-aggressive unless feeling threatened or provoked, their sheer size and strength mean that caution must always be exercised.\n\nWhile incidents of attacks remain infrequent, the potential for bodily harm can be severe, underscoring the need for professional guidance and respect for these majestic animals.\n\nAs safari camping continues to gain popularity on the continent, its important to appreciate the myriad offerings that such experiences provide.\n\nUnlike traditional lodges, which can sometimes separate visitors from the raw essence of nature, camping safaris immerse guests in the heart of the African landscape.\n\nThese adventures afford the unique flexibility to traverse diverse ecosystems, enabling travellers to follow animal migrations based on real-time sightings.\n\nFrom the thrilling sights and sounds of nearby animals to the majestic backdrop of the African night sky, camping safaris present an enriching experience that transcends conventional tourism.\n\nAs the popularity of safari camping rises, its evident that such experiences go beyond mere leisure.\n\nThey foster a profound connection to nature that encourages both conservation and appreciation for the unique environments of the continent.\n\n",

He is to deposit US$500 bail with the clerk of court, said the judge.\n\nThere are indeed changed circumstances. Im of the view that the court a quo misdirected itself. The appellant is a permanent resident of this country.\n\nTo allay the fears, the state can place conditions to ensure that he does not interfere and abscond.\n\nThe judge said the fear of interference does not stand because the docket is now complete.\n\nThe appeal was his second before the High Court.\n\nMhlanga had been denied bail thrice.\n\nHis lawyer, Advocate Thabani Mpofu, who is taking instructions from Chris Mhike, urged the judge to grant the journalist freedom, submitting that there have been changed circumstances.\n\nMpofu said Mhlanga was locked up following calls for protests by war veteran Blessed Geza, but people did not flood the streets as called for.\n\nThe lawyer also said that when Geza called for a national shutdown, people went on with their business.\n\nWe submit that there was an obvious change in circumstances and the court a quo misdirected itself in dealing with a question that was placed before it.\n\nThere have been changes that serve to address the concerns that were initially raised by the courts in denying the appellant bail.\n\nThe charge is transmitting material with the intention of inciting violence. It is critical to consider the importance of the charge.\n\nIt was transmission linked to an event or events and this said, the appellant is a journalist, he asked questions in an interview and answers were given, so if there is an allegation that material meant to incite violence was transmittedthe time of the protests has come and gone.\n\nMay this court take judicial notice that the first call of protest was made and there were no people who flooded the streets.\n\nThere was a call for a national shutdown, but people went on with their business.\n\nWhat is alleged by the state to be the transmission of inciting messages has come and gone. What has not come and gone is the continuity of the incarceration of the appellant in jail.\n\nPart of the reasons for denying bail was that there might be disturbance of peacedisturbance in connection with the event.\n\nMpofu said there was no violence in the country, adding that even the judge, being a Zimbabwean, has noticed this.\n\nMhlanga has filed an application seeking direct access to the Constitutional Court, arguing that he was unlawfully arrested and charged.\n\nThe passage of time in this matter must constitute a changed circumstance. It constitutes a change in circumstance that entitles the appellant to bail.\n\nIf there is no evidence that links him to the crime, he should not be in jail, Mpofu said.\n\nIn challenging the granting of bail to Mhlanga, the state said there is electronic and video evidence.\n\nThe police said they have overwhelming evidence. This means they have gathered the evidence. They have assessed it and came to the conclusion that it is overwhelming. Under those circumstances, there has been a passage of time, and all the witnesses have been interviewed.\n\nSo, My Lord, there is no longer evidence to be interfered with.\n\nThe protests have come and gone.\n\nThat has to have changed circumstances, he said.\n\nFungai Nyahunzvi, representing the state, said prosecution is still opposed to bail.\n\nHe said the argument that Mhlanga has not interfered with witnesses and evidence does not stand and does not change the complexion of the case.\n\nThe fear is still being held. The trial date has now been given.\n\nOne circumstance that has changed is that there has been passage of time, which has given the state time to prepare for trial, and now we are saying we are now ready for trial.\n\nIf we had not done so may be the argument that they have failed to give us a trial date would have helped their case, he said.\n\nHe also said that if granted bail, he might influence witnesses not to testify.\n\nAs we speak, there are people who are appearing in this court after taking heed of the calls to protests so we still have that fear, said the prosecutor.\n\n",

Collaboration, not confrontation, is the path to sustainable progress.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nLISTED pipes and fittings manufacturers, Proplastics Limited, have blamed the implementation of tight Monetary Policy for ZWG shortages, which have hit the business flows.\n\nWhile credited for relative exchange rate stability, which has seen exchange rates hovering between ZWG26 to ZWG32, experts believe the current stability is stage-managed and risks going haywire in the event of the Treasury removing the tight grip on money supply.\n\nEchoing similar sentiments this week, despite a promising start to the quarter, the environment remains constrained by liquidity issues, low economic activity and increasing power disruptions.\n\nThe tight monetary policy measures currently in place have resulted in the scarcity of the local currency, with the resulting slowing in Government projects. Whilst the exchange rate and inflation have been brought under control, the availability of ZWG remains limited, thereby negatively impacting potential revenue streams, the company said.\n\nProplastics said the increase in the foreign currency surrender requirement from 25% to 30% for exports has not only eroded the competitiveness of our exports but has also negatively impacted overall market positioning and exporting viability.\n\nRevenue for the first quarter was primarily received in US$, with US$ payments dominating transactions throughout the period.\n\nIn the current quarter, the formal market, particularly the retail sector, the company made appeals for a reduction in the cost of doing business and the removal of informal sector advantages.\n\nDespite the prevailing liquidity issues, the quarterly sales volumes grew by 11% over the prior period. Revenue grew by 3% to US$4,263 million against US$4,123 million achieved in the prior period, without any export contribution recorded in the current quarter.\n\nProduction volumes also increased by 11% against the previous period, as the business cleared supply backlogs and replenished stocks for high-demand products. The raw material supply remained consistent throughout the quarter.\n\n",
