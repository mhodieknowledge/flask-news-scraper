A contract that is measured in clean water supply, functioning sanitation, well-maintained roads, and refuse collections.\n\nAs we reflect on the performance of our local authorities, it is essential to acknowledge the policy landscape that will inform our next steps.\n\nThe recent performance outcomes and new significant challenges, none of our local authorities exceeded their targets, Garwe said.\n\nThe minister stated the failure by the local councils to reach targets was a reminder that something must be done urgently.\n\nIn the concerning percentage of what rural and urban councils failed below expectations, this data sets as a wake-up call for all of us, added Garwe saying in the length of these outcomes, councils must strategically adapt from the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1), 2021 to 2025, to the forthcoming National Development Strategy 2 (NDS2), 2026 to 2030.\n\nHe stressed that this transition represented not just a change in policy direction, but a critical opportunity to recalibrate governments approach to local governance, which is central to minimum savings in different standards.\n\nNDS2 focuses on enhancing the capabilities of local authorities, ensuring that they are equipped to meet the demands of services delivered in a rapidly changing environment.\n\nCentral to our discussions today is the Cultural Action Group, which is fed with the minimum services delivered standards. And these standards are essential for establishing the baseline for services delivered across all our local authorities.\n\nThey will say this is a guide for local authorities to elevate their performance and ensure that every citizen receives the quality services they deserve.\n\nIt is, therefore, imperative that we institutionalise these standards and hold ourselves accountable for meeting them, said Garwe.\n\nThe minister urged authorities to be focused.\n\nAs we confront the realities of our current performance, let us not lose sight of our goals. The vision of a prosperous and empowered upper-middle income society by year 2030 is within our reach, but it requires a refereeing commitment and collective effort, said Garwe.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, there are 32 urban councils and 60 rural councils, giving a total of 92 councils countrywide.\n\n",
