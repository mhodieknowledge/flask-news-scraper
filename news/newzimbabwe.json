            "content": "By BBC News\n\nFRIDAY night saw Israel and Iran exchange a barrage of air strikes.\n\nFor now, the fighting between Israel and Iran seems restricted to the two nations. At the United Nations and elsewhere there have been widespread calls for restraint.\n\nBut what if they fall on deaf ears? What if the fighting escalates and expands?\n\nHere are just a few possible, worst-case scenarios.\n\nAmerica gets dragged in\n\nFor all the US denials, Iran clearly believes American forces endorsed and at least tacitly supported Israels attacks.\n\nIran could strike US targets across the Middle East  such as special forces camps in Iraq, military bases in the Gulf, and diplomatic missions in the region.\n\nIrans proxy forces  Hamas and Hezbollah  may be much diminished but its supportive militias in Iraq remain armed and intact.\n\nThe US feared such attacks were a possibility and withdrew some personnel. In its public messaging, the US has warned Iran firmly of the consequences of any attack on American targets.\n\nWhat might happen if an American citizen were killed, say, in Tel Aviv or elsewhere?\n\nDonald Trump might find himself forced to act. Israels Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has long been accused of wanting to drag the US into helping him defeat Iran.\n\nMilitary analysts say only the US has the bombers and bunker-busting bombs that can penetrate the deepest of Iranian nuclear facilities, especially that of Fordow.\n\nTrump promised his MAGA constituency he would not start any so-called forever wars in the Middle East. But equally many Republicans support both Israels government and its view that now is the time to seek regime change in Tehran.\n\nBut if America were to become an active combatant, that would represent a huge escalation with a long, potentially devastating consequential tail.\n\nIran is reeling from Israels unprecedented attack  and it is only the start\n\nGulf nations get dragged in\n\nIf Iran failed to damage Israels well-protected military and other targets, then it could always aim its missiles at softer targets in the Gulf, especially countries that Iran believes aided and abetted its enemies over the years.\n\nThere are lots of energy and infrastructure targets in the region. Remember Iran was accused of striking Saudi Arabias oil fields in 2019 and its Houthi proxies hit targets in the UAE in 2022.\n\nSince then, there has been a reconciliation of sorts between Iran and some countries in the region.\n\nBut these countries play host to US airbases. Some also  discreetly  helped defend Israel from Iranian missile attack last year.\n\nIf the Gulf were attacked, then it too might demand American warplanes come to its defence as well as Israels.\n\nIsrael fails to destroy Irans nuclear capability\n\nWhat if the Israeli attack fails? What if Irans nuclear facilities are too deep, too well protected? What if its 400kg of 60% enriched uranium  the nuclear fuel that is just a small step away from being fully weapons-grade, enough for ten bombs or so  is not destroyed?\n\nIts thought it may be hidden deep in secret mines. Israel may have killed some nuclear scientists but no bombs can destroy Irans knowhow and expertise.\n\nWhat if Israels attack convinces Irans leadership that its only way of deterring further attacks is to race for nuclear capability as fast as it can?\n\nWhat if those new military leaders round the table are more headstrong and less cautious than their dead predecessors?\n\nAt the very least, this could force Israel to further attacks, potentially binding the region into a continual round of strike and counter-strike. Israelis have a brutal phrase for this strategy; they call it mowing the grass.\n\nTheres a global economic shock. The price of oil is already soaring.\n\nWhat if Iran tried to close the Strait of Hormuz, further restricting the movement of oil?\n\nWhat if  on the other side of the Arabian Peninsula  the Houthis in Yemen redouble their efforts to attack shipping in the Red Sea? They are Irans last remaining so-called proxy ally with a track record of unpredictability and high risk appetite.\n\nMany countries around the world are already suffering a cost of living crisis. A rising price of oil would add to inflation on a global economic system already creaking under the weight of Trumps tariff war.\n\nAnd lets not forget, the one man who benefits from rising oil prices is President Putin of Russia who would suddenly see billions more dollars flood into Kremlin coffers to pay for his war against Ukraine.\n\nIrans regime falls, leaving a vacuum\n\nWhat if Israel succeeded in its long term aim of forcing the collapse of the Islamic revolutionary regime in Iran?\n\nNetanyahu claims his primary aim is to destroy Irans nuclear capability. But he made clear in his statement yesterday that his broader aim involves regime change.\n\nHe told the proud people of Iran that his attack was clearing the path for you to achieve your freedom from what he called their evil and oppressive regime.\n\nBringing down Irans government might appeal to some in the region, especially some Israelis. But what vacuum might it leave? What unforeseen consequences would there be? What would civil conflict in Iran look like?\n\nMany can remember what happened to both Iraq and Libya when strong centralised government was removed.\n\nSo, much depends on how this conflict progresses in coming days.\n\nHow  and how hard  will Iran retaliate? And what restraint  if any  can the US exert on Israel?\n\n",

compared to April 2025.\n\nIn a report released Saturday, the human rights watchdog documented 83 human rights violations across various areas, including during government-led food aid distribution, instances of political harassment, and restrictions on freedom of assembly and expression.\n\nIn May 2025, the Zimbabwe Peace Project recorded a total of 83 human rights violations affecting 5,376 victims nationwide, a 10% decline from the violations recorded in May where 6,059 people were affected, part of the report reads.\n\nThese violations included breaches of personal security, acts of intimidation and harassment, assault, political discrimination in the distribution of government-sponsored food aid, restrictions on freedoms of expression, assembly, and association, as well as limited access to social services.\n\nOther incidents included unjustified arrests, unlawful evictions, malicious damage to property, inhumane and degrading treatment, and restricted access to information.\n\nFor the second consecutive month, ZanuPF has been identified as the primary perpetrator of violence, followed by the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP).\n\nOf the 5,376 people affected, 3,107 were female and 2,269 were male.\n\nThe report detailed some of the alleged perpetrators.\n\nAmong the perpetrators, those affiliated with the ruling party, Zanu PF, accounted for 35.38%, followed by members of the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) at 13.77%.Other violators included local authorities (16.53%), government officials (11.44%), artisanal miners (5.93%), traditional leaders (6.14%), members of the MDC-Alliance (0.64%) and unaffiliated individuals (6.36%).Worryingly, members of the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) are also implicated, accounting for 0.21% of reported violations.The report highlights that other State security actors, particularly those mandated to protect the public, continue to feature prominently among perpetrators of human rights violations.Despite these concerns, the ZPP expresses cautious optimism about the potential for future improvements.It welcomed and embraced the opportunity to engage with the Zimbabwe Independent Complaints Commission (ZICC) through its goodwill ambassador to promote a rights-based, accountable approach in security operations.We are hopeful that other implicated institutions will be open to such engagements, paving the way for lasting solutions to end impunity and foster sustainable peace in Zimbabwe, the report adds.Geographically, Masvingo and Harare provinces recorded the highest number of violations in May, with 13 each.Midlands followed closely with 12 violations, while Manicaland and Mashonaland West each documented 10.Mashonaland Central experienced a significant decline, from 13 violations the previous month to just four in May.Mashonaland East recorded nine violations, while both Matabeleland North and South recorded six breaches each.ZPP commended the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC) for highlighting urgent issues needing government action, including collapsing public services, a shrinking civic space, and restrictive conditions.\n\nAmong the perpetrators,

            "content": "By Emma Batha I Thomson Reuters Foundation\n\nWhats the context?\n\nZola believed a job in Britains care sector would lead to a better life. But now she is homeless and in debt  this is her story\n\nLONDON Thousands of overseas workers hired by care companies across Britain have been left broke and desperate after losing their jobs in what campaigners say is a national crisis.\n\nIn 2022, Britain launched a visa scheme to encourage migrant workers to bolster its ailing care sector. About 150,000 have arrived from countries including India, Nigeria and Zimbabwe.\n\nBut reports of exploitation have soared.\n\nThe government has since banned hundreds of companies from sponsoring migrant workers  but this has left carers they had already hired jobless and terrified of deportation.\n\nZola, a 45-year-old Zimbabwean care worker, was recruited by a firm in the northern city of Leeds in 2023 but is now 10,000 ($13,500) in debt.\n\nShe told her story to Context but asked to use a pseudonym for fear of repercussions.\n\nThe way weve been treated is outrageous. We were encouraged to come here to contribute our skills, but the jobs never materialised and now were trapped in debt.\n\nWe came here in good faith, but other people have used us to fatten their own pockets. Revoking these companies licences is not enough. They need to be held accountable, and so does the government.\n\nThe first shock when I arrived was the accommodation. They promised us housing, but the property was crammed with people and under renovation. There were bed bugs, there was no heating and we had to use a bucket to wash ourselves.\n\nI thought Id start work immediately, but they kept saying they were losing clients and didnt have shifts.\n\nI think they had hired about 100 of us because we were all in a large WhatsApp group. My annual salary was supposed to be 20,480, but I only received a few shifts and was paid 930 in total in all the time I was with the company.\n\nWe were caring for people in their own homes. Shifts started early and finished at 10 at night, but they only paid for the time you spent in clients homes, not the time you were on call.\n\nBy October, it was very cold outside and we had nowhere to go between appointments so Id spend hours riding around and around the city on buses just to stay warm.\n\nIf the carers complained about anything, the managers would threaten to remove them from the rota or report them to the Home Office. Everyone was afraid of losing their visa and getting deported. There were constant threats.\n\nThen last year the company lost its sponsor licence so I have to find a new sponsor.\n\nThe emotional and financial strain has affected me very badly mentally, especially as my children are still in Harare.\n\nWhen I applied for my visa, the government said carers could bring their children. I was hoping my children would join me once I got established, but that never happened.\n\nNow I dread calls from home  I took the job hoping to create a better life for my children, but I cant even provide them with the basics, which breaks my heart. Sometimes my daughter is crying because she misses me. Its gut-wrenching.\n\nBack in Zimbabwe, I was working as a sales rep for a farm, but they were struggling to keep afloat. Im a single mum with three kids so I needed to find something else.\n\nMy sister told me the UK was looking for care workers so I quit my job and did a Red Cross course and a work placement to get experience.\n\nI heard about a company that would sponsor me for 5,000. It seemed expensive, but some people were paying 10,000. I only discovered later it was illegal to charge these fees.\n\nI borrowed money from friends and relatives and my kids moved in with my mum. There were other expenses for things like an English test, police background check, my visa and flight, so altogether I paid about 7,000.\n\nBut Ive had to borrow even more money since coming here just to survive. Ive had to use food banks or ask for groceries from the church. A friend of my sister has given me a place to sleep.\n\nIts very difficult to find a new sponsor because companies providing home care ask for a driving licence. Another problem is they often want six months experience, but some carers lost their jobs soon after arriving here.\n\nThe government is partly to blame because they allowed these companies to sponsor a lot of people without doing background checks to see if they had enough work for everyone.\n\nSo yes, the government should be held accountable. I came here through the proper channels, I did everything they asked, and now Im treated like someone who came through the back door.\n\nIve thought about going back to Zimbabwe so many times, but then I remember how much I owe everyone. Im just hoping theres light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n($1 = 0.7408 pounds)\n\n(Reporting by Emma Batha; Editing by Ana Nicolaci da Costa.)\n\nContext is powered by the Thomson Reuters Foundation Newsroom.\n\n",
