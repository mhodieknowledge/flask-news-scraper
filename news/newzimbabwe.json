            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA 21-year-old security guard from Kadoma has avoided jail time following an accidental discharge of a firearm, which resulted in the death of a miner at Sengy Mine.\n\nThe state was insisting on a murder charge, but the High Court found Anthony Mutefara guilty of culpable homicide before sentencing him to three years in jail.\n\nTwelve months of his sentence were set aside for two on condition that he does not commit a similar offence.\n\nThe remaining 24 months were suspended on condition that Mutefara performs 820 hours of community service at Mkoba Clinic.\n\nThe unfortunate incident took place last year when he was 20.\n\nIt is a proven fact that Mutefara, a recently trained security guard, was only two days at the new job when he was deployed at Sengy Mine Post in Kadoma.\n\nHe was to relieve a colleague who was going off duty.\n\nThe deceased, in the company of his two co-miners, was whiling away time sitting by the security guard cabin post.\n\nAccording to the unchallenged testimony of the accused, he had just assumed duty and was inside the cabin when the deceased unnoticeably also entered the mini room.\n\nThe deceased had entered the cabin to collect his already charged phone and to charge another as per their custom.\n\nAn inverter had been placed inside the cabin, but behind the door, for the purpose of assisting the miners coming from the underground mining shafts to recharge their mobile phones.\n\nThe inverter was positioned approximately a meter adjacent to the bed, which was also situated therein.\n\nIt is soon after the deceaseds entrance into the said room that a startling sound was heard, leading the deceaseds colleagues to scamper away for safety.\n\nIt was only after the first witness, Peter Milton, regained composure and retraced his way back to the source of the explosive sound did he find the deceased lying face up with his head protruding from the door hanging unsuspended.\n\nAccording to this witnesss testimony upon entry into the cabin to enquire, he then saw the accused astonished and in shock, holding the gun.\n\nBoth the first witness and the accused placed the deceased in a better lying position outside the cabin, reads court papers.\n\nMutefara, who was visibly shaken, was seen using his own garment to try and stabilise excessive bleeding.\n\nIn his defence, Mutefara stated that he took safety precautionary measures as soon as he was handed the gun.\n\nHe placed the gun in a safety catch or mode.\n\nSince he had just learnt that there was a bullet jammed in the barrel, he emptied the gun.\n\nThe first bullet fell under the bed but the second remained lodged.\n\nIn his effort to retrieve the fallen bullet, he placed the gun on the bed whilst bending.\n\nHe hardly noticed the entrance or presence of the deceased until he heard a loud bang.\n\nAt first, he thought it came from outside, as was the norm with explosives at the mine. He then realised that the gun had discharged on its own accord when he saw the smoke on the mouth of the barrel, signalling recent gunfire.\n\nAt the same time, he observed the deceased, who was in a bent position, falling backwards.\n\nIn convicting him, the judge said the manner in which the events unfolded portrays mere carelessness rather than recklessness.\n\nThe accuseds action of taking safety precautionary measures in a confined space borders on negligence rather than out of realisation of risk or possibility that death may ensue out of his conduct of leaving an unsupervised semi-loaded gun for a short stint of time, noted the judge before convicting Mutefara.\n\n",

RBZ officials noted that bolstering gold reserves not only underpins the currency but also enhances resilience to global financial instability.\n\nAs geopolitical uncertainty rises, many countries are turning to gold as a stable asset. Zimbabwe, as a significant gold producer, is well positioned to follow this global trend, a central bank official said.\n\nThe initiative reflects broader international patterns, with countries such as China, Russia and Turkey also increasing their gold holdings to hedge against inflation and currency fluctuations.\n\nAccording to official figures, Zimbabwe produced more than 30 tonnes of gold in 2024, with a growing share retained by the RBZ under the reserve accumulation strategy.\n\n",

To enforce patriotism legally would infringe upon these basic rights, Madam Speaker.\n\nCreating a legal framework compelling ideological loyalty undermines democracy and pluralism through thriving on diversity of opinion. The dangers of institutionalising ideology are as follows: An ideology institution sounds disturbing.\n\nHistory has shown us that once States begin controlling ideology, State abuse, censorship and suppression of dissent follow. Decisiveness and weaponisation risk, it is also going to be one of the challenges, said Karenyi.\n\nZANU PF is pushing to nationalise the ideological school concept it established within its party. The ruling party has previously proposed enrolling civil servants into the Herbert Chitepo School of Ideology.\n\nThe National Ideology would also be incorporated into the school curriculum, with patriotism as a core component of education from primary to tertiary level.\n\nCCC legislator Gladys Hlatywayo warned that the proposal risks being hijacked by ZANU PFs interests rather than serving the nation.\n\nTerms such as national interest are often euphemisms for advancing party interest and the interest of the ruling class or ruling elite. In this case, legislating patriotism might be legislating the zanufication of the State.\n\nThere is also a danger that legislating patriotism can erode civil liberties and restrict freedoms of speech, assembly and association. These civil liberties are at the heart of any democratic society and encoded in our own Bill of Rights, in our own Constitution, and must therefore be protected and protected rather than taken away by opaque, divisive and undemocratic laws under the guise of legislative patriotism.\n\nThe proposed prayer by the mover of the motion also has a chilling effect on public discourse Madam Speaker. Open, honest public debate that is so instrumental to democratic development might be discouraged as fear grips the country, said Hlatywayo.\n\n",
