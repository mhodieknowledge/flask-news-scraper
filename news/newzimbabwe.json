If we attack, it will be fast, vicious, and sweet, just like the terrorist thugs attack our CHERISHED Christians!The warning came after Nigerias President Bola Ahmed Tinubu earlier on Saturday pushed back on Trump announcing a day earlier that he was designating the West African country a country of particular concern for allegedly failing to rein in the persecution of Christians.Nigerias president Bola TinubuIn a social media statement on Saturday, Tinubu said that the characterization of Nigeria as a religiously intolerant country does not reflect the national reality.Religious freedom and tolerance have been a core tenet of our collective identity and shall always remain so, Tinubu said.Nigeria opposes religious persecution and does not encourage it.

She is dedicated to redefining the future of African storytelling.\n\nShe is the creator, executive producer, and head writer of Netflix Original Series Bad Influencer.Bad Influencer is a seven-part crime drama series that balances high-stakes survival with the glossy illusions of influencer culture.At its heart is BK (Jo-Anne Reyneke), a street-smart single mom whose greatest hustle is protecting her son. Destiny puts her in the path of Pinky (Cindy Mahlangu), a rising influencer with flair and chaos to spare.Maradzika shared with IOL that she used to be a micro-influencer and attended brand events. Although she didnt stay long, she thought it was an interesting world.I didnt stay in it, but what I kept was an interesting story which I pitched and we turned it into an idea through 18 months of development, working with my company Lincoln Green Media, also working with Gambit, who are incredible producers, to put something together that is unique and fresh for an audience.On Bad Influencer, BK and Pinky descend into Joburgs counterfeit economy, selling fake luxury handbags. Fame and fraud become indistinguishable, likes and lies trade places, and instinct demands they walk the knife-edge between heart and hustle.The series takes a look at the different social issues that come with the world of influencers. Maradzika explained that she chose to tackle this because there are many layers to the story.Theres so many layers to influencer culture, but I think whats important with the story is that its not judging in any way. Its just telling a story of two women, women who are women before their influences, or a mother, and I think thats what people all relate to most.Maradzika has been in the industry for about 11 years and has worked as a development executive at Paramount Viacom. Her work has reached global audiences through Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Showmax, MTV, BET, and Comedy Central.\n\nShe is the creator, executive producer, and head writer of Netflix Original Series Bad Influencer.\n\nBad Influencer is a seven-part crime drama series that balances high-stakes survival with the glossy illusions of influencer culture.At its heart is BK (Jo-Anne Reyneke), a street-smart single mom whose greatest hustle is protecting her son.
