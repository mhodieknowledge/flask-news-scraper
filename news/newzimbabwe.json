The work shifts start at 5am up to 7pm in the evening.\n\nWe receive between US$7,00 and US$8,00 per day. The owners of the company are reluctant to give us contracts and if you question them they respond by beating up the workers, the employee alleged.\n\nAnother employee (name withheld) who spoke to our news crew alleged that at one point he was beaten up until he later lost his tooth\n\nOn night shifts we are given just one hour to eat and rest. If you wake up late, say about just five minutes later, US$20,00 is deducted from your earnings, he said.\n\nAnother former employee alleged that when he was summarily fired a few months ago, efforts to recover his outstanding dues were foiled after the Chinese company owners unleashed dogs.\n\nQuizzed on why the recently dismissed worker had not filed a report with the police, he said, When I went to the police station in Msasa, which is close to the company, the officers told me they could not open a docket if I did not provide fuel for them to go and investigate the matter.\n\nAfter all, reporting to the police in the area is just an exercise in futility because the guys just bribe their way out.\n\nEfforts by NewZimbabwe.com to contact the company were fruitless since there was no readily available website or social media handles on the company.\n\n",
