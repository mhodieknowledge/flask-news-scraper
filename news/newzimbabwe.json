            "content": "Xinhua\n\nLinda Hungwe, a 52-year-old farmer from Masvingo Province in southeastern Zimbabwe, believes that the key to maintaining food security is to adopt indigenous seed varieties that are well-adapted to the local environment.\n\nSeed symbolizes the beginning of life, and when I control the choice of the seed I grow, I take charge of my destiny, Hungwe told Xinhua during the National Good Seed and Food Festival recently held in Harare, the countrys capital, an annual event to promote indigenous seeds, traditional foods, and sustainable agricultural practices.\n\nDuring the festival, Hungwe and other farmers showcased various indigenous seeds, exchanged seeds, and shared knowledge on Zimbabwes culinary culture.\n\nThe farmer said she grows indigenous crops such as pearl millet, finger millet, round nuts, and cowpeas, which are more drought-tolerant, better adapted to local soil, and more resilient to pests.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, recurrent droughts have diminished crop yields for farmers dependent on rain-fed agriculture, prompting them to adopt drought-tolerant indigenous crops.\n\nFarmer-led seed systems are important because, as a farmer, I know the qualities of the seed, my soil, its shortcomings and needs, she said, adding that indigenous seeds can be grown organically, which reduces reliance on expensive external inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides.\n\nChristopher Chinyoka, another farmer from Masvingo Province, said seed exchange among farmers is a long-standing tradition that ensures food security by maintaining locally adapted crops.\n\nSeed exchanges have been carried on from our ancestors; its a culture that creates a bond between people. We had seeds that had gone extinct, but now they have been revived, thanks to seed exchanges. If my crop fails due to drought or other reasons, I can always get the seed from other farmers, he said.\n\nA farmer shows her agricultural products at a seed and food festival in Harare, Zimbabwe, Sept. 20, 2025.(Xinhua/Tafara Mugwara)\n\nChinyoka added that smallholder farmers should not be at the periphery of food production, but rather be at the forefront to effectively safeguard food security.\n\nArchbold Sasa, a lecturer in the Department of Crop Science at the Marondera University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology in Zimbabwe, said smallholder farmers are key to promoting food security and resilience.\n\nSmallholder farmers play a crucial role in storing some seed varieties because they keep producing them from time to time, so that we dont lose that genetic material as a country. Its sort of a seed bank, he said. Some crops are being neglected, and people are not producing them anymore, but we tend to find those seeds in smallholder farmers.\n\nIn addition to indigenous grains, farmers are encouraged to adopt indigenous vegetables, including blackjack, pigweed, okra, and pumpkin leaves, due to their high nutritional value and adaptation to local climates.\n\nWe are doing seed exchange from one district to another so that people will have a diversity of these indigenous vegetables to promote their nutrition, resulting in improved health, said Sasa.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA nine-year land dispute between the Greater Spitzkop Residents Association and property developer Vevhu Resources has finally been resolved, paving the way for long-delayed development.\n\nThe Supreme Court recently dismissed the residents final appeal, effectively ending a protracted legal battle that saw 16 cases filed, all decided in favour of the developer.\n\nVevhu Resources Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Dube, confirmed that civil works will begin next week and assured residents that no one will be left homeless.\n\nWe have had a challenge in Lot 14 where we had a lot of people who came in and settled not by the Act of Vevhu Resources and over the years trying to develop the place has been very difficult, Dube said.\n\nHe explained that delays were also caused by shifting government regulations, including a requirement to allocate 40% of the land to flats, which conflicted with how residents had already settled.\n\nSo it became a bottleneck to try and deal with the occupants to say we need to move certain people to make for the apartments which was government regulation which was gazetted by government through cabinet, he added.\n\nDespite the setbacks, Dube said the company had opted for a compromise.\n\nSo what we have done is that we told people that we will try and adopt the old plan which conforms to how people are already settled, he said.\n\nAccording to Dube, only a third of residents will be affected, but they will remain within Spitzkop Lot 14.\n\nWith the adoption of the old plan it means we are now able to accommodate everyone who has been settled here, he said.\n\nThe original layout plan for Lot 14 Spitzkop provides for 3,595 stands, including shops, schools, and recreational facilities. Over the years, however, some residents had occupied land earmarked for public institutions, sparking resistance whenever development was attempted.\n\nLocal councillor Tafadzwa Kambarami welcomed the resolution, calling it a win for both residents and progress.\n\nWe are happy that the developer understood our concerns despite us having lost court cases. What we want is development and residents have to comply. Everyone is happy because there will be no evictions. We want sanity. We want development and Im happy that residents have accepted what the developer has brought on the table. Development should start right away, he said.\n\nWith the long-standing dispute now settled, construction in Spitzkop is finally set to move forward.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nNewly appointed Zanu PF Treasurer General Patrick Chinamasa has dismissed Advocate Thabani Mpofus recent criticism of President Emmerson Mnangagwas Politburo reshuffle as baseless and without substance, labelling it a misleading interpretation.\n\nMnangagwa made changes to the Politburo structure last month in a move that political analysts believe is strategically aimed at curtailing his deputy, Retired General Constantino Chiwengas, aspirations to succeed him.\n\nAmong the changes, Mnangagwa demoted Obert Mpofu from the influential position of Secretary General to the less prominent role of Secretary for Information Communication Technology (ICT).\n\nMpofu is reported to be an ally of Vice President Constantino Chiwenga and is alleged to have had knowledge of the source of the corruption dossier Chiwenga tabled in the last Zanu PF Politburo meeting in Harare.\n\nThe dossier allegedly named controversial business tycoons Kudakwashe Tagwirei, Wicknell Chivayo, Paul Tungwarara and Delish Nguwaya.\n\nJacob Mudenda, Speaker of the National Assembly, replaced Mpofu as Secretary-General, while Chinamasa himself was shifted from Legal Affairs Secretary to the role of Treasurer General of the party.\n\nAdvocate Mpofu subsequently took to social media, alleging that Mnangagwa had violated the partys constitution with the changes he had made.\n\nThe letter from Chris Mutsvangwa purporting to announce changes to the ZANU PF Politburo is invalid. It claims the decision to relieve Obert Mpofu of his office as ZANU PF Secretary-General was taken under Article 9, sections 65 and 67, Mpofu, the lawyer, stated.\n\nHowever, Chinamasa responded to Mpofus claims yesterday blow by blow.\n\nThis claim is a classic case of mala fides interpretation. The relevant provisions of the Zanu-PF Constitution clearly stipulate the President and First Secretarys authority over the Politburo, Chinamasa wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on Wednesday.\n\nHe said: Article 9, Section 65 (2022 Constitution) explicitly states:\n\nThe Politburo shall be appointed by the President and First Secretary under Section 67\n\nSection 67 reinforces this by stating that:\n\nImmediately after the election of the President and First Secretary and Members of the Central Committee, the President and First Secretary of the Party shall appoint from the newly elected Central Committee, two (2) Vice-Presidents and Second Secretaries, the National Chairman, the Heads of Departments of the Politburo, the Committee Members of the Politburo and the Deputies to the Heads of Departments.\n\nThis language is categorical and unambiguous. The authority vests in the President and First Secretary  not in any collective, committee, or ancillary structure. Thus, any personnel changes announced are lawfully anchored in the Presidents prerogative. To argue otherwise is to deliberately distort the plain meaning of the text.\n\nAdvocate Mpofu also argued that Article 9 of the Zanu-PF Constitution does not empower Mnangagwa to reassign office holders outside of the partys elective congress.\n\nArticle 9 concerns Politburo functions generally and does not confer authority for the First Secretary to reassign office-holders, Mpofu, the lawyer, contended.\n\nIn response, Chinamasa urged Mpofu to have a look at himself and understand the Zanu-PFs Constitution in its entirety.\n\nThis assertion demonstrates either wilful blindness or a blatant disregard of the Constitutions architecture.\n\nWhile Article 9 indeed outlines the functions of the Politburo, Section 65 therein is not a functional clause  it is a structural clause explicitly tying the Politburos composition to Presidential appointment powers. It must be read in pari materia with Section 67, which sets out the scope of such appointments.\n\nChinamasa further dismissed Mpofus interpretation of the Zanu-PF Constitution, arguing that it misrepresented the powers bestowed upon the President and First Secretary. He stated that Mpofus arguments were a bit of a reach, and that Mpofu was getting ahead of himself.\n\nChinamasa pointed out that the Constitution explicitly allows for the reassignment and removal of department heads, and that Mpofus reading of Sections 65 and 67 pertained to the Politburo itself, rather than subordinate roles.\n\nHe accused Mpofu of missing the mark completely, saying that Mpofus arguments have no real basis in the documented and agreed-upon Constitution.\n\n",
