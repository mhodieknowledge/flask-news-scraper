            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) church has reaffirmed its apolitical stance, unequivocally stating that its pulpit will only be used to advance Gods work and never a platform for political expediency.\n\nThe SDA church has lately faced a barrage of criticism following pulpit rants by former army commander, General Anselm Sanyatwe, that Zanu PF will rule forever whether you like it or not. The soldier-turned-politician, who is now Sports minister, was addressing SDA members during a philanthropy activity in Nyanga, Manicaland province, recently.In a statement to counter the narrative that the SDA tolerated Zanu PF politicians abusing its organisation, SDA Zimbabwe East Union Conference Executive Secretary, Zibusiso Trust Ndlovu reiterated the sacred nature of the institution, which must shun politics.Recent statements made during an evangelistic campaign hosted by one of our local churches have understandably caused concern.While it is consistent with our practice to invite public officials to our events as a gesture of courtesy and mutual respect (CM 126-127), any partisan political remarks made were not anticipated, were not authorised by the church leadership, and do not reflect the position of the church, said Ndlovu.According to the statement, Sanyatwe was cautioned over his unpalatable remarks, and is said to have apologised.The matter was immediately brought to the attention of the speaker, who graciously acknowledged the concern and extended an apology to church leaders on the same day, added Ndlovu.The SDA reaffirmed that the sacredness of the pulpit is non-negotiable and applies across all church organised events, and whoever intends to address congregants must bear this in mind.\n\nThe SDA church has lately faced a barrage of criticism following pulpit rants by former army commander, General Anselm Sanyatwe, that Zanu PF will rule forever whether you like it or not.

The boy was on his way to school when he was attacked at the intersection of Musasa and Mapereke roads in New Marlborough.\n\nThis incident comes just three weeks after the death of Samuel Machara, who was fatally attacked by a Pitbull in Bluffhill, only five kilometres from New Marlborough.\n\nIn an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Matthew Chifamba, a neighbour of the dogs owner, said the canines have long been a nuisance and have since destroyed the perimeter wall which separates their households.\n\nOur kitchen door faces the perimeter wall. Sometimes when we open the door, they just start barking at us, and they bulldozed our durawall.\n\nWe have tried to engage with him (dog owner) but it seems he is not bothered by our concerns.\n\nChifamba called for the dogs to be euthanised.\n\nNow things have escalated to this attack on the child, and to move forward, these dogs should be put down, he said.\n\nAucious Mubvumbi added that the community is no longer safe as there are a lot of stray and unattended dogs in the area.\n\nMarlborough is now full of stray dogs. Usually, there is a pack of six dogs which roam around in the evening, said Mubvumbi.\n\nMeanwhile, the killer Pitbull owner, Mike Mupinga, was on Tuesday denied bail by Harare Magistrate Marewanazvo Gofa.\n\n",
