This is a pivotal moment for our farmers, who have waited long for formal recognition of their land rights, Masuka said.\n\nAgriculture Minister Anxious Masuka\n\nHe revealed that around 360,000 Model A1 farmers and 24,000 Model A2 farmers stand to benefit. However, he admitted that logistical challenges remain. Of the 24,000 Model A2 farmers, only about 12,000 have surveyed units ready for processing, with the remainder requiring surveying  a major bottleneck in the process.\n\nTo address this, Masuka said government had engaged the private sector to speed up surveying using modern technology. He also announced the establishment of a one-stop centre at Makombe Complex to streamline title deed processing.\n\nThe centre operates with seven workstations, covering everything from verifying tenure documents to finalising agreements for title deeds, he explained.\n\nOn financing, Masuka said farmers would have several options, including cash purchase, credit facilities, and mortgage arrangements through local banks. To incentivise quick payments, a 15% discount will be offered for cash transactions made within 90 days.\n\nDespite these measures, Masuka acknowledged ongoing challenges, particularly with land surveys and bureaucratic delays, but pledged that government remains committed to ensuring all qualifying farmers receive their title deeds within the set timeframe.\n\n",

What I request is that the Hon. Member should bring the paperwork which talks about the prevalence of homicide cases.\n\nIf we respond to such a question without evidence that this is happening, this is an issue which does not augur well, said Ziyambi.\n\nIn recent months, the country has been witnessing murder cases related to gun violence. They have been attributed to the proliferation and ownership of guns by individuals.\n\nIn May this year, the Zimbabwe Republic Police raised concern about the increase in illegal firearms, which is in contravention of the Firearms Act Chapter 10.09.\n\nZiyambi further said the government does not tolerate homicide cases.\n\nGovernment does not want to see homicide cases happening because it is a criminal offence. It is one offence which had a capital punishment life in jail. In the past, it used a death sentence which was given to an offender.\n\nSo, when we look at the issues to do with homicide, you would find that when criminals hear that there are punitive penalties that have been given to perpetrators of homicide, then this would discourage others.\n\nI want to urge the Hon. Member to put in writing his question so that we get clarity and that we also clarify, he said.\n\n",

So its going to be a very tough encounter for us, but we have to grind out a positive result.\n\nThe Warriors will be without vice-captain Marshall Munetsi for the Benin clash.
