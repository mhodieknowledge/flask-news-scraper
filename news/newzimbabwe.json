The HPA manual clearly stipulates the requirements for the registration and licensing of health facilities, including those providing medical rehabilitation services.\n\nIt has come to the attention of the HPA that numerous facilities are operating without the requisite registration, offering services such as substance abuse rehabilitation, mental health rehabilitation, physiotherapy and occupational therapy and other forms of rehabilitative care.\n\nThese illegal facilities often lack qualified personnel, appropriate infrastructure, and adherence to established medical protocols. This poses serious risks to patients, including substandard care, abuse and neglect, spread of infectious diseases, administration of harmful or unproven treatment and lack of recourse, said Chimbwanda.\n\nZimbabwe has in recent years seen a sharp rise in drug and substance abuse, especially among youths, with the high unemployment rate and economic situation being identified as chief among the causes.\n\nHPA has engaged with the law enforcement agencies to clamp down on these illegal centres, which are violating the HPA Act.\n\nHPA wishes to emphasize that operating an unregistered health facility is a violation of the Health Professions Act [Chapter 27:19]. The Authority is working in collaboration with law enforcement agencies to identify and close down these illegal facilities and bring the perpetrators to justice. HPA urges the public to verify the registration status of any medical rehabilitation centre before seeking treatment or admitting a loved one, said Chimbwanda\n\nThe HPA has listed down the legal registered health facilities and encouraged members of the public to report any other bogus institutions to the law enforcement agencies.\n\nBelow is the list of registered admitting rehabilitation centres in Zimbabwe:\n\n",

Plans for 2025 include commencing the refurbishments of Holiday Inn Harare, Elephant Hills Resort, Troutbeck Timeshare Lodges and the second phase of renovations at The Victoria Falls Hotel, he said.\n\nOn the downside, Mhishi said these refurbishments will prompt reduced rooms inventory for the group for the 2025 financial year underscoring that such strategic capital investments aim to enhance guest experiences and grow the portfolios market share.\n\nDespite the mixed fortunes in the economic environment, which saw the 43% devaluation of the ZWG currency triggering exchange rate losses, the group achieved positive volume growth across all its segments.\n\nRevenue from continuing operations at US$ 53,98 million increased by 15% compared to the prior year, supported by growth in occupancy and stronger Average Daily Rates which increased by 3% to US$ 119, compared to US$ 115 in the prior year.\n\nContinuing operations revenue was further bolstered by the Real Estate segments contribution of US$ 3.02 million, primarily driven by residential stand sales. Revenue from the Groups discontinued operations, which consists of the Great Zimbabwe Hotel, Monomotapa Hotel, and Sun Leisure Tours, amounted to USD 8.24 million.\n\nTotal Group revenue, including discontinued operations, amounted to US$ 62.22 million, representing a 14% growth from the prior year.\n\nAs we move into 2025, we remain optimistic about the recovery of the tourism sector, building on the progress made in the local market and the ongoing rebound of international travel. The UN Tourism Organization forecasts a 5% growth in international tourist arrivals, driven by the full recovery of the Asia and Pacific markets and robust growth across most other regions, added Mhishi.\n\n",

On its part, the Government of Zimbabwe developed minimum service delivery standards to guide local authorities in the implementation of their roadmaps, said Muswere.\n\nThe objectives for developing minimum service delivery standards include defining the minimum levels of services that local authorities should provide, and the nature of service recipients should expect in terms of quantity, quality, time and cost.\n\nOther objectives are to determine the minimum cost for the provision of services, to provide uniformity and consistency in the provision of services at local level, and to provide a basis upon which feedback on the level of satisfaction against the standards will be evaluated.\n\nEach area has performance indicators, benchmarks and performance standards. The data will be submitted online, with a real-time dashboard system being implemented to track, monitor and evaluate progress.\n\nThe performance of local authorities, both urban and rural, will be based on assessments set in the minimum service delivery standards framework, he said.\n\nMuswere added that residents and ratepayers must demand from local authorities services commensurate with what they are billed.

The Mines Ministryand the client were saying, okay, we will not do the 16 hectares, allow us to do one hectare, she told the Parly committee.\n\nShe continued: We do not understand why these applications are being entertained with a similar problem for Matopos, one of our flagships.\n\nWe received hundreds of complaints and petitions from all over the world, from embassies, but we seem not to really have that much value for conservation.\n\nBut we know that conservation, if we look after our animals, if we look after our areas, we have the potential to generate more money. Conservation preserves the environment and generations will continue to come and see these areas.\n\nMutyambizi, however, highlighted that there was conflicting legislation on mining and conservation in Zimbabwe, making it difficult to take full control of the protected areas.\n\nWe do have a serious problem but as ZimParks, all we can do is to try and use our own legislation, but we have got conflicting legislation that is also coming into our areas.\n\n",
