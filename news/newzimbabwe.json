            "content": "Business Report\n\nZimbabwean companies are grappling with severe economic challenges, including soaring inflation, a skewed exchange rate, and escalating operational costs, forcing some to retrench workers and others to reduce stock levels.\n\nAmong the hardest hit is Tongaat Huletts Zimbabwean subsidiary, Triangle, which announced job cuts after other cost-saving measures failed. Retailers like OK Zimbabwe are also struggling, with de-stocking becoming a growing concern as businesses navigate the countrys volatile economic landscape.\n\nAn uncertain monetary framework, characterised by run away inflation, a skewed exchange rate and pricing distortions, has left corporates in Zimbabwe battling for survival. Some of them have had to retrench while the retailers are de-stocking.\n\nZimbabwe is already battling a high unemployment rate that has driven droves of locals to seek greener pastures in South Africa and elsewhere on the region and internationally at a time the countrys economic challenges are mounting.\n\nTongaat Huletts Zimbabwean unit, Triangle, said this week that it was facing operational challenges that had forced it to retrench employees after cost cutting measures failed to yield a respite.\n\nThe current economic environment in Zimbabwe has presented unprecedented challenges for Triangle Limited over the past [three] years. After careful deliberation and extensive evaluation of our operational and economic realities, we have made the extremely difficult decision to implement a phased retrenchment process, Tendai Masawi, the managing director of Triangle, said in a note to employees this week.\n\nHe cited escalating operational costs particularly in areas such as fertiliser, fuel, maintenance costs and imported goods/services, combined with inflationary pressures, currency losses, the inability to claim VAT on inputs after sugar was exempted from VAT, and competition from low cost duty-free imported sugar as having severely impacted the companys ability to sustain continued production.\n\nTriangle, which housed Tongaat Huletts Zimbabwean interests that also include Hippo Valley, said it had seen profit margins decline significantly by 55%with manpower costs is spiking by 133% as a proportion of revenue, and debt levels rising to unsustainable levels.\n\nTriangle had thus been unable to generate positive cash flows from its operating activities over the past three years as it had faced a very constrained working capital position.\n\nThese financial realities underscore the urgent need for corrective action so that the business can generate sufficient cash flows to reduce debt and reinvest in its future. This (retrenchment) decision has been taken to protect the long-term sustainability of our organisation and ensure that Triangle Limited continues to play its vital role in Zimbabwes economy, the company said.\n\nTongaat Hulett Limited, is currently preparing to dispose of the Zimbabwe operations to the owners of the Vision Group for about R5.9 billion. The Zimbabwe operations for Tongaat Hulett were among a few stable divisions under the crisis ridden and troubled South African sugar and agro-processing unit that also had operations in Mozambique.\n\nRetailers are equally affected, with OK Zimbabwe and other operators like Choppies reducing stock levels due to policies that mandate local currency transactions despite widespread use of foreign currencies.\n\nDe-stocking levels across most of OK Zimbabwes outlets have raised the alarm and concerns that the company is buckling under Zimbabwes policies that force retailers to trade in local currency against widespread use of foreign currencies in a country battling for currency stability.\n\nIn a statement, OK Zimbabwe acknowledged that it had faced stocking levels over the past few weeks. The company faced intermittent product supply challenges during the festive period. The Company, as well as most of the formal retail sector, has been adversely impacted by a volatile operating environment, said OK Zimbabwe.\n\nMeanwhile, manufacturers like Mega Mart have appealed to government officials for structural reforms to expand the formal sector, which they argue would boost tax revenues and support economic recovery.\n\n",

It must consider that sentence first, it can go down or up.\n\nThese sentencing guidelines tend to be followed. In this case, it provides for two presumptive sentences.\n\nWhere the prejudice is insignificant it can be six months.\n\nWhere the item, funds, or property is of high value or State funds, it will be an aggravating factor.\n\nIf the fraud is committed by an offender who is a holder of a public office, it is an aggravating actor and the court should start from there.\n\nIf it involves public funds, it is an aggravating actor and the court should start from there, he said.\n\nThe judge also criticised lawyers for delaying progress and how Mpofu made his application, noting that he laboured the court with unnecessary submissions.\n\nWhat should be important to a practitioner is to provide facts that there are compelling reasons.\n\nKwenda said the fact that the Constitutional Court took the entire third term of the 2024 judicial year was regrettable, although it was dismissed.\n\nHe said the bail application by Mpofu also did not meet the basic provisions of a bail application.\n\nA bail application is expected to be simple and unemotional presentations of facts supporting ones entitlement to bail, he said.\n\nHe also said some submissions were not persuasive.\n\nThe State had persuaded Kwenda to hold that the two were resisting trial.\n\nProsecutors also said their likelihood of absconding was higher because the legal woes had increased.\n\nKwenda said each case depends on its circumstances.\n\nMy analysis of facts and submissions before me are as follows. Bail matters should be simplehowever, as a profession, we tend to be so obsessed and end up unwittingly infringing upon the matter that will be before a court.\n\nHe further complained about how the court sat for two days only to hear a bail application which was regarded as urgent.\n\nIt was extraordinarythat speed resolution of bail cannot be completed if we take two days on a bail application.\n\nThe simple issue before me was whether the applicants should be granted bail.\n\nA lot of time was lost while parties tussled over what type of an application was before me.\n\nI must criticise both counsels before me. There is no need to give a process like bail application, a name that does not appear in the CPEA Act.\n\nIm just saying to show that we delayed this case for no reason, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "VOA\n\nA Zanu PF parliamentarian has confirmed that efforts are being made by the ruling party and a faction of the opposition Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) to amend the Zimbabwe Constitution in order to extend the term of office of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, legislators and councilors by at least five years.\n\nIn a statement, Zanu PFs Bikita West Member of Parliament Energy Mutodi said a proposed motion on presidential, parliamentary and local government term limits was untimely leaked to the media.\n\nMutodi said the proposed draft motion circulating on social media is authentic and work in progress, which will become official when signed by the Speaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda and its proponents.\n\nMutodi, who allegedly authored the draft motion with CCCs Charles Moyo, said due process will be followed in accordance with the Standing Rules and Orders and the Constitution of Zimbabwe leading to a properly approved motion.\n\nBut Moyo distanced himself from the leaked document saying, I have nothing to do with that and the only person to speak about this issue is our senate leader Hon. Nonhlanhla Mlotshwa.\n\nThe latter said her party has nothing to do with the draft motion and make no mistake, we will oppose it as much as we can because I support constitutionalism and not somebody who wants to change the constitution to suit himself.\n\nHowever, backers of the draft motion said to be at least 22 CCC parliamentarians and a large number of Zanu PF legislators, are confident that they will table it when parliament opens in February.\n\nMutodi and his colleagues have already informed Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi about their intentions. The minister was not available for comment as he was unreachable on his mobile phone.\n\nThere is a lot of resistance in the ruling party about any constitutional amendments relating to presidential terms. A senior Zanu PF official, who requested not to be identified in fear of being victimized, said, I think I can honestly say its madness! Theres no reason to extend EDs term and its insanity for the opposition to openly advocate for the ruling party to continue ruling. I know that as a party, we are really good at intelligence and corrupting the opposition, but this is brazenly ridiculous.\n\nConstitutional expert Lovemore Madhuku, who is also leader of the opposition National Constitutional Assembly party, told Studio 7 that Zimbabweans should take to the streets to block any constitutional amendments that would lead to the extension of the term of office of the president.\n\nMadhuku said, This is a year where we ought to face directly and bluntly this whole nonsense about 2030 and it must be buried whether alive or dead and once we bury it we are able to move forward with the politics of the country. This thing must be removed from our political processes.\n\nMutodi and his colleagues are planning to move a motion for the introduction of a constitutional amendment bill that seeks to amend Section 95(b) of the Constitution of Zimbabwe to allow the term of the president to be extended by any period not exceeding 5 years as shall be determined by parliament.\n\nThe proposed bill, according to the draft motion, will seek to also amend Section 91(2) of the Constitution of Zimbabwe to allow parliament to determine an additional period of time the president may continue to hold office at the expiry of his or her second term.\n\nThey want parliament to amend Section 143(1) and 158(1)(a) to extend the term of office for parliamentarians by such period parliament may determine for the sake of economic development, peace building and the restructuring of government including addition or abolition of government posts.\n\nThe proponents of the motion are also suggesting the amendment of Section 328(7) which bars a sitting president from seeking a third term, arguing that the current supreme law does not conform to the needs of Zimbabweans as there is need to hold a referendum before any constitutional amendments.\n\nAccording to the lawmakers, some of the constitutional provisions do not meet the current aspirations of the people of Zimbabwe who would like to see the current national development trajectory continue under Mnangagwa.\n\nThey claim that there is a lot of toxic politics in Zimbabwe, which calls for a comprehensive electoral reform process, dialogue and consensus by all citizens.\n\nThe proponents of the draft motion also claim that Mnangagwa deserves an extension of his term beyond 2028 when his two terms expire as he has worked hard for Zimbabwes social and economic development.\n\nSome members of a faction of the CCC led by Welshman Ncube, including the self-imposed party secretary general Sengezo Tshabangu, are allegedly backing proposals for amending the constitution in order to extend the term of office of the president.\n\nTshabangu was recently suspended by CCC for allegedly attempting to make some parliamentary leadership changes without following proper party procedures. He has dismissed his suspension as nonsensical.\n\n",

Despite our many areas of disagreement and the tension that we sometimes have had, we have continued to support the Zimbabwean people.\n\nThat is not the kind of relationship we want to have. We would like Zimbabwe to be a self-sufficient, self-reliant country that can stand on its own two feet, and make its own decisions without the influence of anybody else.\n\nTremont was speaking on American platform Do Hard Stuff, hosted by J. W. Oliver of ZimWorX, an organisation promoting employment creation in Zimbabwe.\n\nWe are constantly trying to win people over to believing that the US is a force for good in the world and that we should be the partner of first resort in solving all of the worlds problems, said Tremont.\n\nOur interests in Zimbabwe are to build partnerships with Zimbabweans so that we can counter challenges such as climate change, hunger, and disease increase trade and combat diseases.\n\nWe believe that increased trade and prosperity is important for us and Zimbabweans. Those are the sort of things we talk about with the Zimbabwean government.\n\nOur goals in Zimbabwe havent really changed so much over the years.\n\nWelfare and equality in Zimbabwe are actually getting worse.\n\nThe rich are getting richer, the poor are getting poorer, the number of people living below the poverty line has doubled since 2011 despite significant Chinese investment here.\n\nWe believe that strong democratic institutions and respect for human rights are really key components of having a free market economy that works well without corruption.\n\n",

This resulted in a decline in the exchange rate premium to a low level of 27% on the buying rate by mid-October.\n\nHowever, since mid-October, the upward pressure on the buying rate at the parallel market began to resurface, which pushed the premium to about 46% on the 31st of October 2024, the industry group said.\n\nThe CZI said sources of liquidity that drove the parallel exchange rate towards the end of October need to be addressed, as the trend in the parallel market had demonstrated that the parallel market rate can indeed appreciate under tight liquidity.\n\nThe industry lobby group said the 43% devaluation of the official exchange rate initiated by the RBZ did not result in convergence with the parallel market buying rate, as the parallel market rate also depreciated by 24% on the same day.\n\nThe recent ZiG inflation surge in the months of September and October 2024 confirms that inflation in Zimbabwe is exchange rate driven. The outlook for inflation generally hinges on the ability to stabilise the exchange rate, added CZI.\n\n",
