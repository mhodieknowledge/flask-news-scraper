The first accused (Dube) came with a certain lady called Sbahle and they entered the car.\n\nThe second accused drove to town where Sbahle dropped off and then drove to Eastlea, where he parked at number 15 Frank Johnson Avenue Eastlea, Harare.\n\nThe first accused went into the building and the second accused told the complainant to go inside the room where the meeting was supposed to be held.\n\nThe complainant was shocked to see a bed and when she turned back she saw the second accused locking the door and the first accused entered the room using the other door, locked it and started to laugh.\n\nThe complainant cried for help but was silenced by the first accused who told her not to anger the second accused and ordered her to remove her clothes, reads court papers.\n\nThe court heard that Charlie pushed her onto the bed and undressed her and Dube forced her to suck his manhood.\n\nThe two allegedly took turns to rape her whilst forcing themselves on her mouth.\n\nAfter the act, the complainant went to the bathroom where the second accused was and he again had sexual intercourse with her once without her consent.\n\nThe first accused also had sexual intercourse with her for the second time without her consent, the State alleges further.\n\nThe court heard that the accused persons booked a taxi for the complainant and she went home that is when she filed a police case.\n\nThe accused deny the charges.\n\nDube and Charlie are represented by Shepherd Makonde.\n\nCaroline Mashingaidze is prosecuting.\n\n",

            "content": "By DD News\n\nZIMBABWE has recorded a rise in AIDS-related deaths in the first half of this year, Health and Child Care Minister Douglas Mombeshora said on Friday.\n\nAddressing a media workshop on HIV reporting and stigma reduction in the capital Harare, Mombeshora stated that between January and June 2025, the country recorded 5,932 AIDS-related deaths, up from 5,712 during the same period last year.An increase of 220 deaths is a reminder that our work is not done, he said, without specifying the main cause behind the rise.The minister noted that while Zimbabwe has made significant strides in combating HIV/AIDS  particularly in achieving the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets  the gains remain fragile and are threatened by multiple challenges, including limited resources, stigma, and discrimination.As a nation, we must confront these realities with honesty and resolve. Addressing stigma and discrimination is not only a moral obligation; it is a public health imperative, he said.Zimbabwe is now seeking to transition to full domestic financing for its HIV and AIDS response amid declining external funding, Mombeshora said.During this transition, the country is facing difficulties in maintaining outreach staff and ensuring continuity of community-based services, according to a report by Xinhua.Operational adjustments are being made to safeguard service delivery, he added, stressing the need for innovation, stronger domestic partnerships, and a resilient, self-sustaining national response to the epidemic.According to the World Health Organization (WHO), HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) attacks the bodys immune system, specifically the white blood cells, weakening the bodys defense against infections and diseases. If untreated, HIV can progress to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), the most advanced stage of the infection.HIV is transmitted through body fluids such as blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breast milk, and can also be passed from mother to child. It is not spread through casual contact like kissing, hugging, or sharing food.The disease can be prevented and managed through antiretroviral therapy (ART). Without treatment, HIV can take years to develop into AIDS.\n\nAddressing a media workshop on HIV reporting and stigma reduction in the capital Harare, Mombeshora stated that between January and June 2025, the country recorded 5,932 AIDS-related deaths, up from 5,712 during the same period last year.\n\nAn increase of 220 deaths is a reminder that our work is not done, he said, without specifying the main cause behind the rise.The minister noted that while Zimbabwe has made significant strides in combating HIV/AIDS  particularly in achieving the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets  the gains remain fragile and are threatened by multiple challenges, including limited resources, stigma, and discrimination.As a nation, we must confront these realities with honesty and resolve.

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nAN economic analyst has urged the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) to be cautious following the decision to halt the sale of gold coins.\n\nIn a statement, RBZ governor Dr John Mushayavanhu informed members of the public that the mop up sale of gold coins had been suspended, with immediate effect, following the successful completion of the exercise.\n\nThe RBZ would like to clarify that this was a sale meant to clear remaining stock and not the minting of new gold coins which had been suspended in April 2024.The latest round of gold coin sales also included coins redeemed by holders, he said.\n\nThe central bank exchequer advised members of the public that future gold coin sales will be undertaken upon accumulation of a sizable quantity from redemptions with gold coins in the market remaining tradable and redeemable.\n\nThe gold coins were introduced by the RBZ in 2022 as an investment avenue for holders of excess local currency, who could easily purchase the bullion coins to store value.\n\nAgainst the backdrop, a respected economist who preferred anonymity warned the RBZ against the decision to block the sale of gold coins arguing the decision exposes the local currency to inflationary pressure.\n\nThese coins eased pressures from the market because they provided a valve to a safe investment instrument. Upon their introduction, several companies avoided flooding the parallel exchange market to pursue the local currency and in a way this maximized currency stability. The RBZ just has to be very careful because apart from sustaining tight liquidity, they have few options in place in the event of shifting such a policy stance, he said.\n\nThe economist said the possibility of loosening the grip on liquidity is very high considering the current pressures mounting from industry which leaves the ZWG currency vulnerable.\n\nSo at some point we are likely to see companies and other individual holders of excess ZWG flooding the foreign exchange market in search of the greenback and such a scenario is very dangerous, he said.\n\nAs at February 2023, gold coins worth ZW$20 billion had been sold with the bulk being snapped up by corporates, in the process contributing towards mopping up of excess liquidity.\n\nIn the same year, several companies and the Insurance Pension Fund (IPEC) reported that gold coins were seen as an investment opportunity by several pension funds which spent ZW$2,29 billion purchasing the investment instruments.\n\nIn the same year, several companies and the Insurance Pension Fund (IPEC) reported that gold coins were seen as an investment opportunity by several pension funds which spent ZW$2,29 billion purchasing the investment instruments.\n\n",
