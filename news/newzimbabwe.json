            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA Kadoma man accused of stabbing another miner to death in a suspected love triangle has been acquitted after the High Court ruled that police bungled investigations and relied on genuine but mistaken witnesses.\n\nJustice Philda Muzofa cleared Mashoko Midzi of murdering Stanly Mpofu, who was stabbed four times and died at Chimwendo Compound, Battlefields, on December 23, 2022.\n\nMidzi had been arrested in dramatic fashion, shot twice by police who claimed he attacked them with a machete. But in a damning judgment, the court said there was no proof he resisted arrest or carried the alleged weapon.\n\nThe evidence placed before us established police high-handedness when they arrested the accused, Justice Muzofa ruled. Of all the strange evidence placed before us, the following can take the prize Surely how can two police officers contradict each other on such a pertinent issue unless nothing of this sort happened?\n\nAccording to the State, Mpofu had clashed with Midzi earlier that day at a canteen where they argued over Beatrice Chinamasa, a young cook who had just started working there. Chinamasa later confirmed she was dating Mpofu, but said she never saw Midzi that day and did not know he was allegedly interested in her.\n\nWitness Agatha Sibanda, Mpofus aunt and the canteen owner, told the court she saw Midzi chasing her drunken nephew before he collapsed, bleeding heavily. But the judge found her evidence unreliable.\n\nHer evidence was that she saw his clothes. That is weak identification, said Justice Muzofa. Jeans and gumboots are common clothes in the mining communities for men. We conclude that Agatha was a genuine but mistaken witness.\n\nMidzi insisted from the start that he was innocent, saying he spent the night drinking beer at Fambai Bar with friends and relatives. He raised this alibi in his warned-and-cautioned statement just days after the killing.\n\nThe court criticised investigators for failing to properly test that defence. It was within the polices capacity to record statements from Moyo Mine, the accuseds companions or someone from Fambai Bar. They did not, the judge said. The alibi remained intact.\n\nAlthough the State had raised a strong suspicion that Midzi may have killed Mpofu, the judge stressed that suspicion was not enough.\n\nThe standard of proof in criminal cases is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, she ruled. In this case, the evidence raised many unanswered questions, leading to doubt. In such instances, the matter is resolved by giving the accused the benefit of doubt.\n\nMidzi was acquitted and walked free after more than two years of fighting the charge.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nThis month, a chaotic and hilarious comedy, starring several South African A-listers, is scheduled for release in cinemas.\n\nLoved Out starringSomizi Mhlongos daughter,Bahumi Mhlongoand veteran actressKhabonina Qubeka, tells a story that many can relate to: love is important, but self-love is vital.\n\nThe movie is slated for a September 26 release and is written, directed and produced by Tendayi Nyeke.\n\nUnder the direction of Tendayi Nyeke, Loved Out tells a story that many can relate to  love is important, but self-love is vital. Image:Supplied.\n\nDespite her ambition and drive to run her family restaurant, she often finds herself in the role of caretaker for her mother,Gloria, played byQubeka.\n\nGlorias wild behaviour often complicates Ruvas dreams, making the journey to success a comedic rollercoaster.\n\nLoved Out explores the idea that love for others, for our passions and places, isnt enough to make us whole unless we nurture self-love, shares Nyeke.\n\nShe continues: It showcases the struggles we go through when trying to grow personally while the people we love might seem to be standing in our way.\n\nThe movie is inspired by Nyekes own journey when she moved to South Africa from Zimbabwe nearly ten years ago.\n\nFaced with economic difficulties and grief, she started observing others coping with hardship and the absurd situations that arose; she decided to blend these experiences into a unique story.\n\nDespite my dreams, goals and the love I shared with others, external pressures made it incredibly difficult to thrive. I observed how people around me, including my own family, struggled to make sense of their circumstances, and how influential people like religious figures or those with more resources would take advantage of such crises.\n\nThrough this experience, I found humour in the absurdity of how some find opportunities in others struggles. Loved Out was born from my attempt to navigate a world that wasnt easily accommodating my dreams, drawing from characters I know, aspects of myself, and things I cherish to create this cinematic world.\n\nNyeke said the movie tackles parent-child relationships, the pursuit of dreams and self-love.\n\nWe look at the nuance and complexity of parent-child dynamics, specifically portrayed through the mother-daughter relationship between Bahumi and Khaboninas characters. Parent-child relationships have many layers that can hurt such a bond.\n\nBut its not always easy to talk about. It exposes the struggle a child may face in finding their own voice, particularly in cultures where challenging elders is not encouraged. The film questions what happens when these elders become chaotic and suffocating.\n\nThe film explores the difficult decisions one must make to achieve their dreams, and how far we are willing to go to fulfil our ambitions and finally, self-love. We often seek validation from relationships and careers, so they end up defining our identity.\n\nThis theme explores what it truly means to love oneself, even when the results are not the desired outcome for those around you.\n\nKhabonina Qubeka. Image: Supplied.\n\nNyeke adds that Loved Out is about finding joy and humour even in tough times, echoing the resilience many Africans possess.\n\nLoved Out offers a comedic reflection of ourselves.As an African person, I appreciate our ability to find humour even in the most challenging situations. Instead of being crippled by adversity, we often find a way out by embracing the hilarious and crazy aspects of life.\n\nI hope this movie brings joy, humanity and beauty to audiences, allowing them to see themselves and others, laugh and process their own experiences through art.\n\nWorking with a talented ensemble cast, including Tumi Morake, Ayakha Ntunja and Marcus Mabusela, Nyeke expressed her gratitude for the support and expertise of the cast.\n\nShe notes how privileged she felt to work with such talented women in telling this female-driven story.\n\nA scene from Loved Out. Image: Supplied.\n\nWorking with incredible talents Khabonina Qubeka and Tumi Morake was an incredible honour. I was initially intimidated as a first-time director, but they were incredibly generous with their expertise, humour and willingness to go the extra mile.\n\nI learned an immense amount from them and felt incredibly blessed to be supported by such formidable women who championed a female-led story.\n\nNyekes vision for the film extends beyond entertainment; she hopes Loved Out will become a catalyst for dialogue between mothers and daughters, encouraging them to talk about difficult subjects through its engaging narrative.\n\nI invite mothers and daughters who struggle with difficult conversations to watch this film together at the movies and use it as a catalyst for dialogue. I invite couples, friends and families to come and be part of the conversation.\n\nUltimately, I want people to experience a wide range of wonderful and sometimes challenging emotions in community, because community makes us better.\n\nWatch the trailer below.\n\n",

These included building sufficient foreign currency reserves and slashing annual inflation from 94% to single digits.\n\nThe ZiG wasintroducedin April 2024, marking the southern African nations sixth effort to stand up a viable local currency after previous efforts failed amid sky-high inflation and collapsing values on foreign exchange markets.\n\nSigns of improving sentiment toward the ZiG include a slowdown in the rate at which it is exchanged for US dollars, said Matshe, citing banking data.

Finer details on the reasons behind the job cuts and terminal benefits to be paid remain unclear. What boggles the mind is that the workers have since been placed on paid leave while the organisation has moved swiftly to replace some of the targeted workers, one insider said on condition of anonymity.\n\nAnother source alleged that the retrenchments disproportionately affected staff who were members of trade unions.\n\nOver and above all these shortcomings, we need to understand why the company has hurriedly replaced the affected workers in some sections, while others have been replaced through outsourcing services like cleaning. Among those recruited recently are allegations that they were warned against being unionised as a condition of service, the source claimed.\n\nThe affected employees are now expecting a reasonable termination package as they argue that the employers decision has nothing to do with the inability to pay salaries.\n\nWhen contacted for comment, MIL general manager Sibusisiwe Ndlovu neither confirmed nor denied the allegations, instead referringNewZimbabwe.comto the internal communications department, which had not responded by the time of publication.\n\nHowever, a letter seen byNewZimbabwe.com,dated September 16, 2025, and signed by Ndlovu, confirmed the institutions decision to retrench some staff. The letter, addressed to one affected employee (name withheld), reads in part:\n\nWe wish to advise you that your position has been affected by the restructuring exercise, therefore, you are among members of staff who will be retrenched. The intended retrenchment will take effect from the fourteenth day after the date of receiving this letter.\n\nEngagements with you shall commence soon, and it is our hope that a retrenchment agreement will be reached to facilitate an expeditious conclusion of this in a manner which is fair and transparent.\n\n",

Now they dont have to look beyond Africa to get it, he said.\n\nMasiyiwa, who isworth about $1.3 billion, is known for building Econet Wireless into one of Africas largest telecom groups.\n\nIn recent years, he has expanded Cassava from telecoms into cloud computing, fintech, cybersecurity andartificial intelligence.\n\nThefirst AI factory is already under developmentin South Africa and will run on 3,000 Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nCassava says much of this computing power has already been reserved by African researchers and developers.\n\nCompany officials said the new facilities will help close a major gap in Africas digital economy.\n\nOnly about 5% of African AI talent currently has access to the high-performance computing power needed to train advanced AI models.\n\nBuilding local infrastructure could allow more African researchers to develop homegrown tools in sectors like finance, education, health and agriculture.\n\nCassava also plans to link the AI factories to its wider digital network, which includes Africa Data Centres, Liquid Intelligent Technologies, and Liquid C2.\n\nThese companies already provide data storage, internet connectivity and cybersecurity services across the continent.\n\nEarlier this year, Cassava launched a dedicated AI business unit and signed partnerships with global tech firms including Microsoft, AWS, Google and Anthropic to support African developers.\n\nAnalysts say the push could helpAfrica compete in the fast-growing global AI industrywhile keeping sensitive data on the continent.\n\nIt could also reduce costs for local startups and governments, who often pay high fees to store and process data overseas.\n\nIf completed on schedule, all five factories are expected to be operational by late 2026, positioning Cassava as one of the biggest builders of AI infrastructure in Africa.\n\n",
