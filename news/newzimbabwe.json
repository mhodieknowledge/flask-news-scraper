            "content": "By Reuters\n\nPARIS/MORONISeveral hundred people and possibly even thousands may have been killed when the most powerful cyclone in nearly a century hit the French Indian Ocean archipelago of Mayotte, a senior local French official said on Sunday.\n\nI think there will certainly be several hundreds, maybe we will reach a thousand, even several thousands, prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville said on local media channel Mayotte La 1ere.Asked about the death toll from Cyclone Chido, the French interior ministry said it will be difficult to account for all victims and a figure could not be determined at this stage.Cyclone Chido hit Mayotte overnight, Meteo-France said, with winds of more than 200 kph (124 mph), damaging housing, government buildings and a hospital. It was the strongest storm in more than 90 years to hit the islands, the forecaster said.Honestly, what we are experiencing is a tragedy, you feel like you are in the aftermath of a nuclear war I saw an entire neighborhood disappear, Mohamed Ishmael, a resident of Mayottes capital Mamoudzou, told Reuters by phone.Aerial footage shared by the French gendarmerie showed the wreckage of hundreds of makeshift houses strewn across the hills of one of Mayottes islands, which have been a focal point for illegal immigration from nearby Comoros.Local media images showed a mother pushing a newborn babys crib along the flooded corridor of Mayottes hospital.Capsized police boats lay onshore while coconut trees had crashed through the roofs of many buildings.My thoughts are with our compatriots in Mayotte, who have gone through the most horrific few hours, and who have, for some, lost everything, lost their lives, French President Emmanuel Macron said.In the last few decades thousands of people have attempted to make the crossing from Comoros, off the coast of East Africa, to Mayotte, which has a higher standard of living and access to the French welfare system.Over 100,000 undocumented migrants live in Mayotte, according to the French interior ministry.It was difficult to ascertain the precise death toll after the cyclone, which also raised concerns about access to food, water and sanitation, authorities said.For the toll, its going to be complicated, because Mayotte is a Muslim land where the dead are buried within 24 hours, a French interior ministry official said earlier.Located nearly 8,000 km (5,000 miles) from Paris, Mayotte is significantly poorer than the rest of France and has grappled with gang violence and social unrest for decades.More than three-quarters of the people in Mayotte live below the French poverty line. Tensions were stoked earlier this year by a water shortage.An air bridge was being put in place from Reunion island, another French overseas territory on the other side of Madagascar, the government said.The disaster is the first challenge faced by Prime Minister Francois Bayrou, days after he was named by Macron following the collapse of the previous government.The cyclone went on to hit northern Mozambique on Sunday, but the full extent of the impact was not clear.Internet monitor NetBlocks said on X that heavy rain and winds had damaged power and telecommunications infrastructure.In Comoros, two people were slightly injured, 24 displaced, and 21 homes were destroyed, authorities said.France colonised Mayotte in 1843 and annexed the whole archipelago, including Comoros, in 1904.In a 1974 referendum, 95% backed separation but 63% on Mayotte voted to stay French. Grande Comore, Anjouan and Moheli declared independence in 1975.

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nOPPOSITION politician, Nelson Chamisa says greedy opposition leaders lack the gravitas to liberate Zimbabwe from its current hardships just by merely criticizing the government for poor planning and inducing hunger ravaging the nation.\n\nThe popular politician was speaking to NewZimbabwe.com shortly after hosting the Charity Fund Raising Dinner held at a local hotel Saturday night.\n\nOver the years, Chamisa has taken advantage of the event to mobilise resources for onward transmission to targeted families across Zimbabwe every festive season.\n\nAsked to share his views against a background where some opposition leaders have defected to the ruling party while a section of citizens are getting weary of the countrys prolonged struggle, the opposition leader reiterated that the journey to freedom is not meant for self serving people.\n\nThe struggle to liberate the country is neither a one-day wonder nor instant coffee affair. Its not a walk in the park or a fly-by-night task. One needs to be consistent, conscious and strong. The fight is not a fight for opportunities, but a fight for values.\n\nWe need strong leaders. Leaders who are not after serving themselves but who serve others. Leaders who are not motivated or driven by a galloping appetite for material gains. Leaders must be driven by the broader and collective objective of making a difference, he said.\n\nHe decried the fact that this years fundraising dinner comes at a time when more people are increasingly in need of food aid, a situation which he blamed on poor foresight on the part of the countrys leadership.\n\nThe 47-year-old opposition leader said there is an urgent need to utilise technologies and water harvesting techniques to avert the impact of current drought crises.\n\nOur loss must be compensated for in a lot of planning and building of Citizens Relief Services Programme. But also, being able to harvest and harness water. Rains fall and when they come water flows right into the oceans, we are not harnessing and harvesting the water. We need to come up with green belts and the Green Zimbabwe Programme, he said.\n\nChamisa underscored that hardships have crossed all boundaries leaving many struggling despite political affiliation. He said the problems had forced many citizens to relocate to other countries in search of a better life.\n\nThis situation, he said, cannot be treated as a Zanu-PF party issue alone but rather a Zimbabwean issue requiring citizens to join hands in crafting a lasting solution.\n\nQuizzed on whether he would compromise if President Emmerson Mnangagwa was going to extend an olive branch and pave the way for working together with citizens at the centre of the priorities, the opposition leader said sticking issues have to be resolved first.\n\nA conversation, yes. Compromise perhaps not because the issue is to first identify the problem and the solution. We will then need to engage the people of Zimbabwe in their totality.\n\nRight now we are a divided people. We are a divided country. We are a divided government because the people are ultimately the government, but the government is divided because people do not agree on how the government must function or be constituted.\n\nThe 2023 dispute is a case in point and that is the starting point of our conversation and resolution in this country. An ostrich mentality of burying its head in the sand thinking it will save the back when the marauding fire spreads around is not of any help, Chamisa added.\n\n",

For instance, under the natural resources cluster are entities such as Kuvimba Mining House.The energy and trading cluster includes Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA), the countrys power utility and the National Oil Company of Zimbabwe while the infrastructure has entities such as the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ).Other clusters include industrials, financial services and real estate.Speaking during a panel discussion recently, Mutapa deputy chief investment officer, Ernest Denhere said more work to attain full scale efficiency is still in the pipeline.We have developed an investment strategy and clustered the fund into five main sectors: natural resources, energy and trading, infrastructure, industrials and financial services and real estate. We are focusing on infrastructure, mining and energy as enablers for economic growth, aligning with the governments Vision 2030 aspirations.To achieve this, we need to address governance issues, upskill and train board members, and ensure the portfolio companies are fit for purpose, Denhere said.He said going forward, the funds strategy will be underpinned by giving the portfolio companies autonomy to make commercial decisions, unwind legacy debt, and embrace innovation.The fund has undertaken an aggregated assets valuation exercise placing the consolidated value at US$16 billion.Sources confirm that behind the scenes, work is currently underway to extract indebted companies from the doldrums and find a lasting solution towards clean balance sheets.The fund has since commenced negotiations with Cold Storage Commission (CSC) creditors, who include the ZESA Holdings, the National Social Security Authority (NSSA), and urban councils in Bulawayo, Harare, and Chinhoyi in a bid to inject capital into the concern and help it to spur operations.Recently, the MIF also approved a significant joint venture valued at US$350 million between Indian firm Jindal Africa Investments and ZESA to refurbish six units at Hwange Thermal Power Station.Financial analyst, Owen Mavengere said MIF is approaching the tasks ahead through the right procedure.In the short-term period 6-12 months, the MIF has to begin with immediate actions such as implementing transparency measures, conducting audits, and setting up the oversight bodies in the subsidiaries. Initial steps in digitising processes and reducing red tape can also start in this period.In the Medium-term (1-3 years): Focus on deeper structural changes, including full digitisation of processes, comprehensive workforce optimisation, and instilling a culture of accountability and efficiency.\n\nZimbabwes first Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWF) origins can be traced back to a mining sector policy study conducted in 2012 that recommended the establishment of the fund to drive long-term investment leveraging on mining, natural and other resources that would anchor inclusive economic growth and development.\n\nFormerly the SWF, the MIF was established by an Act of Parliament in 2014 called Sovereign Wealth Fund Act (Chapter 22:20) and is currently led by John Mangudya as its chief executive officer.In September 2023 it was renamed to Mutapa Investment Fund through Statutory Instrument 156 of 2023, by President Emmerson Mnangagwa using the Presidential Powers (Temporary Measures Act).Since kick starting operations around April 2024, the MIF has undertaken work aimed repositioning SOEs to productivity.For instance, new board members for Air Zimbabwe and Allied Timbers were appointed as part of its efforts to revitalise these SOEs.Silvanos Gwarinda has been appointed as the chairperson of the national airline, with Precious Sibiya serving as his deputy.Other notable board members include veteran banker Onesemo Mukumba, Lilina Chigodora, and Farai Mpofu.Within a short space of time, the MIF has organized 66 companies into five clusters to optimise benefits.

We are focusing on infrastructure, mining and energy as enablers for economic growth, aligning with the governments Vision 2030 aspirations.To achieve this, we need to address governance issues, upskill and train board members, and ensure the portfolio companies are fit for purpose, Denhere said.He said going forward, the funds strategy will be underpinned by giving the portfolio companies autonomy to make commercial decisions, unwind legacy debt, and embrace innovation.The fund has undertaken an aggregated assets valuation exercise placing the consolidated value at US$16 billion.Sources confirm that behind the scenes, work is currently underway to extract indebted companies from the doldrums and find a lasting solution towards clean balance sheets.The fund has since commenced negotiations with Cold Storage Commission (CSC) creditors, who include the ZESA Holdings, the National Social Security Authority (NSSA), and urban councils in Bulawayo, Harare, and Chinhoyi in a bid to inject capital into the concern and help it to spur operations.Recently, the MIF also approved a significant joint venture valued at US$350 million between Indian firm Jindal Africa Investments and ZESA to refurbish six units at Hwange Thermal Power Station.Financial analyst, Owen Mavengere said MIF is approaching the tasks ahead through the right procedure.In the short-term period 6-12 months, the MIF has to begin with immediate actions such as implementing transparency measures, conducting audits, and setting up the oversight bodies in the subsidiaries.

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nHOME Affairs Minister, Kazembe Kazembe says it is imperative to explore and implement alternative measures that prioritize the dignity and human rights of all individuals, regardless of their migration status.\n\nAddressing participants during a workshop on International Migration Day at Mana Resort in Harare last week, Kazembe said, whilst migration was a complex global phenomenon that require comprehensive and compassionate approaches, detention may sometimes be necessary for specific cases, but there must be other dignified ways to deal with offenders (migrants) other than incarceration.International Migration Day is celebrated on 10 December each year.The Inter-Ministerial Committee on Migration must ensure that the nexus between migration and development in Zimbabwe is mainstreamed and that there is coherence and coordination on migration governance across policies, laws and institutions.As we are all aware, it is imperative that we explore and implement alternative measures that prioritize the dignity and human rights of all individuals, regardless of their migration status.In upholding rights of migrants, we agree in principle, process and practice that detention of any migrant who has committed administrative offenses, must be used as a measure of last resort, Kazembe told workshop participants.The minister admitted, however, that in pursuing the objective of ensuring safe, orderly and regular migration and cognizant of merging migration trends and patterns, it has been increasingly apparent there are mixed migration flows which require a case management approach as some migrants are in essence stranded, undocumented, asylum seekers, women or children with peculiar vulnerabilities.In this regard, the Home Affairs ministry, working with the office of the Attorney General, has made significant strides in ensuring that legal instruments under its purview are aligned to the Zimbabwe Constitution, which broadly embraces the rights of all Zimbabweans and migrants.The minister highlighted that the establishment of the Gender Based Violence Call Centre (GBCC) at Immigration Headquarters sought to uphold migrant rights by ensuring migrants in vulnerable situations have access to prompt assistance.Also, the Zimbabwe Immigration Act (Chapter 4: 02) has inherent provisions that accord migrants detained the right to contest their detention, or challenge prohibition deeming orders instituted on them.Where a detention has been contested, decisions made by the court have at all material times been honoured. Through the Taskforce on Criminal Justice chaired by Justices of the High Court, all migrant detentions in Zimbabwe are subject to judicial oversight and cases of arbitrary detention are yet to detected, added Kazembe.The Public Service ministry has been instrumental in the provision of shelter to children of detained migrants in line with the principle of non- detention of minors.Zimbabwe, as a United Nations member state has high regard to the Global Compact on Migration (GCM), which guided the formulation of the National Migration Policy.Even though the principles in the GCM are non-binding, they largely resonate with Zimbabwes development agenda, hence their incorporation into Zimbabwes National Migration Policy, stated Kazembe.According to him, the on-going rolling out of the Online Border Management System has enhanced the capacity of the Department of Immigration to profile, screen and monitor prohibited persons and other irregular migrants and potential irregular migrants through proactive tools such as the Passenger Name Record (PNR), Advance Passenger Information (API) and INTERPOLs i/24/7.While these efforts are commendable, we are convinced that more can be done in advancing migrant rights.Further, he said the Immigration Department had developed Standard Operating Procedures, ensuring that thedetention of any migrant is a product of due process, only sanctioned at level of an Assistant Regional Immigration Officer or Regional Immigration Officer.It is for this cause that the ministrys policy objectives include ensuring the effective protection of migrant rights through effective application of regional and international best practices.The workshop provided an opportunity to learn from experiences of other United Nations (UN) Member States and determine what practices can be adapted to the Zimbabwe scenario and it was graced by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) director general, Amy Pope who visited the country last week.\n\nAddressing participants during a workshop on International Migration Day at Mana Resort in Harare last week, Kazembe said, whilst migration was a complex global phenomenon that require comprehensive and compassionate approaches, detention may sometimes be necessary for specific cases, but there must be other dignified ways to deal with offenders (migrants) other than incarceration.\n\nInternational Migration Day is celebrated on 10 December each year.The Inter-Ministerial Committee on Migration must ensure that the nexus between migration and development in Zimbabwe is mainstreamed and that there is coherence and coordination on migration governance across policies, laws and institutions.As we are all aware, it is imperative that we explore and implement alternative measures that prioritize the dignity and human rights of all individuals, regardless of their migration status.In upholding rights of migrants, we agree in principle, process and practice that detention of any migrant who has committed administrative offenses, must be used as a measure of last resort, Kazembe told workshop participants.The minister admitted, however, that in pursuing the objective of ensuring safe, orderly and regular migration and cognizant of merging migration trends and patterns, it has been increasingly apparent there are mixed migration flows which require a case management approach as some migrants are in essence stranded, undocumented, asylum seekers, women or children with peculiar vulnerabilities.In this regard, the Home Affairs ministry, working with the office of the Attorney General, has made significant strides in ensuring that legal instruments under its purview are aligned to the Zimbabwe Constitution, which broadly embraces the rights of all Zimbabweans and migrants.The minister highlighted that the establishment of the Gender Based Violence Call Centre (GBCC) at Immigration Headquarters sought to uphold migrant rights by ensuring migrants in vulnerable situations have access to prompt assistance.Also, the Zimbabwe Immigration Act (Chapter 4: 02) has inherent provisions that accord migrants detained the right to contest their detention, or challenge prohibition deeming orders instituted on them.Where a detention has been contested, decisions made by the court have at all material times been honoured.
