It is primarily funded through a mix of fiscal surpluses, resource earnings, privatisation proceeds, and official foreign currency operations. The fund was renamed via Statutory Instrument 156 of 2023 in line with the countrys broader economic objectives.The recent endorsement by ASIF signals a step forward in enhancing MIFs ability to engage with strategic partners across the continent. The announcement came during ASIFs 2025 meeting, where the organisation welcomed new members, including Ghanas Petroleum Fund. The new additions bring ASIFs total membership to 17 sovereign wealth funds from across Africa.A key highlight from the meeting was the creation of three working groups focused on agricultural development, climate finance, and data infrastructure. These groups are expected to collaborate on impactful projects that align with ASIFs broader mission of supporting Africas sustainable development and wealth transfer to future generations.The ASIF Council will reconvene later in 2025 to review progress and discuss future investment strategies.Launched in June 2022, ASIF started with 10 founding members and has since grown to include 15 sovereign wealth funds. Its aim is to foster cross-border collaboration between African nations to pool resources and expertise, driving larger and more impactful investments for the continents growth.This development highlights a growing trend of African sovereign wealth funds working together to accelerate the continents economic progress, with MIF now joining an influential network of investors.\n\nTHE African Sovereign Investors Forum (ASIF) has officially endorsed the Mutapa Investment Fund (MIF) as its newest member.\n\nThis recognition marks a significant milestone for the Zimbabwean sovereign wealth fund, formerly known as the Sovereign Wealth Fund of Zimbabwe, which was rebranded following the re-election of President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa in 2023.MIF, led by chief executive officer John Mangudya, is a state-owned investment fund established under Zimbabwes Sovereign Wealth Fund Act (Chapter 22:20).

Muwodzeri said.The MPs call comes after this weeks mysterious murder of prominent businessman Joseph Mutangaz Mutangadura (67) who was gunned down at his Lisheen Estate in Ruwa late last Sunday.Joseph Mutangaz MutangaduraActing leader of government business in Parliament Anxious Masuka said guns have to be registered.Guns have to be licenced. I know the ministry has requested that more punitive measures be meted on those found to be in possession of illegal firearms, and not just in possession, but it is also worrisome to hear that those firearms are used to commit robberies and some of those culminating in murders, Masuka said.However, Masuka highlighted to Speaker Jacob Mudenda that because of the gravity of the matter, licenced or unlicenced guns can be used for robberies and to commit murder, hence a research on the veracity of the issue should be done.Referring to the question by Muwodzeri, the minister responded: This is a very worrisome development.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nWestProp Holdings, for the second year running, served as the main sponsor of the annual ZimReal Property Conference, which brought together over 300 property developers, owners, pension fund executives, bankers, and other professionals.\n\nThe real estate conference ran under the theme, Cementing Growth and Growing Value.\n\nIn his opening remarks, WestProp CEO Ken Sharpe highlighted stark realities facing Zimbabwes property sector, noting that real estate contributes only 2% to the countrys GDP, compared to an African average of 12% and a global average of 20%.\n\nEven more concerning, he said, was the states contribution to the mortgage market, just 0.04%, while in developed nations such as Switzerland, it stands at 125%.\n\nSharpe stressed that meaningful growth cannot be achieved without unlocking capital, as mortgages and long-term financing are the lifeblood of a functional property market.\n\nWithout these instruments, he said, we build, but we do not grow, leaving both developers and ordinary Zimbabweans constrained in their dreams of owning homes, shops, or land.\n\nClosing the conference, WestProp Holdings Chairman Dr. Michael Louis urged honest engagement between the real estate industry and government, warning that policy inconsistency, infrastructure bottlenecks, bureaucracy, and unstable currency frameworks continue to dampen investor confidence.\n\nIf we are serious about growth, these matters cannot remain at the fringes of policythey must become core agenda items. We cannot talk of cementing growth when the foundations are shifting beneath our feet, Dr. Louis said.\n\nHe called on policymakers to work alongside the industry as true partners, adding: Stable currency policy, consistent land administration, and predictable legal frameworks must not be ambitiousthey must be the norm.\n\nConcluding his remarks, Dr. Louis emphasised that real estate is about more than just buildings, it is about laying strong foundations for families, businesses, and national pride. He urged the sector to think long term, act collaboratively, and lead with vision so that it not only participates in the future but actively shapes it.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nGOVERNMENT says it is in the process of acquiring modern machines to conduct open-heart surgeries at major hospitals in the country, a lack of which has hindered specialised treatment.\n\nThis follows a series of childrens open-heart surgeries conducted recently at Parirenyatwa Hospital by specialist doctors from Egypt, as part of the governments partnership programme.\n\nFor a country grappling with a poor health system, the programme was a shot in the arm for heart patients.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament recently, the Deputy Minister of Health, Sleiman Kwidini, said the government is procuring machines to decentralise open-heart surgery operations.\n\nWe want you to bear with us that it is not yet at full capacity because of the staff attrition and other modern equipment which we are now procuring to make sure that it will be in full function. It will be decentralised in all our central hospitals, as you are aware that all our central hospitals have specialists who can perform these surgeries.\n\nWhat is now hindering them is the modern equipment to use for that, but definitely with time, we are going to make sure that it is going to be done to our locals and to our people for free, said Kwidi.\n\nThe lack of medical equipment in major public hospitals has left many citizens to seek treatment outside the country.\n\nHowever, the poor who cannot afford specialised treatment in foreign countries and private medical facilities have to contend with the dire services in public hospitals.\n\nKwidini made a bold assertion that the government is addressing the countrys healthcare systems.\n\nWith that, as per our policy, we want to make sure that these trained specialist doctors locally are going to be capacitated, especially with the tools of trade.\n\nThat is why we have seen now that our President has moved to the mantra to say, let us renovate our health institutions into the modern systems to ensure that we are able to do the specialised treatment which people are seeking on these major operations, especially in India and other countries, said Kwidini.\n\n",
