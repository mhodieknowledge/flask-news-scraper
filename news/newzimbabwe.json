            "content": "By The New York Times\n\nA DRAFT circulating inside the administration lists three tiers of countries whose citizens may face restrictions on entering the United States.\n\nThe most stringent restriction level would flatly bar citizens from 11 countries from entering the United States.\n\nThe Trump administration is considering targeting the citizens of as many as 43 countries as part of a new ban on travel to the United States that would be broader than the restrictions imposed during President Trumps first term, according to officials familiar with the matter.\n\nA draft list of recommendations developed by diplomatic and security officials suggests a red list of 11 countries whose citizens would be flatly barred from entering the United States. They are Afghanistan, Bhutan, Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen, the officials said.\n\nDraft List of Proposed Travel Ban Countries\n\nAn internal Trump administration proposal lists the following countries whose citizens could face restrictions on entering the U.S. Some countries may change in any final order.\n\nRed\n\nAll travel banned\n\nOrange\n\nVisas sharply restricted\n\nYellow\n\n60 days to address concerns\n\nThe officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the sensitive internal deliberations, cautioned that the list had been developed by the State Department several weeks ago, and that changes were likely by the time it reached the White House.\n\nOfficials at embassies and in regional bureaus at the State Department, and security specialists at other departments and intelligence agencies, have been reviewing the draft. They are providing comment about whether descriptions of deficiencies in particular countries are accurate or whether there are policy reasons  like not risking disruption to cooperation on some other priority  to reconsider including some.\n\nThe draft proposal also included an orange list of 10 countries for which travel would be restricted but not cut off. In those cases, affluent business travelers might be allowed to enter, but not people traveling on immigrant or tourist visas.\n\nCitizens on that list would also be subjected to mandatory in-person interviews in order to receive a visa. It included Belarus, Eritrea, Haiti, Laos, Myanmar, Pakistan, Russia, Sierra Leone, South Sudan and Turkmenistan.\n\nWhen he took office on Jan. 20, Mr. Trump issued an executive order requiring the State Department to identify countries for which vetting and screening information is so deficient as to warrant a partial or full suspension on the admission of nationals from those countries.\n\nHe gave the department 60 days to finish a report for the White House with that list, meaning it is due next week. The State Departments Bureau of Consular Affairs has taken the lead, and the order said the Justice and Homeland Security Departments and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence were to assist with the effort.\n\nSpokespeople at several agencies declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment. But the State Department previously said it was following Mr. Trumps order and was committed to protecting our nation and its citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process, while declining to specifically discuss internal deliberations.\n\nThe Times and other news outlets reported this month that Afghanistan, which was not part of Mr. Trumps first-term travel bans but fell to the Taliban when the U.S. withdrew its forces in 2021, was likely to be part of the second-term ban. But the other countries under consideration had been unclear.\n\nIt is also not clear whether people with existing visas would be exempted from the ban, or if their visas would be canceled. Nor is it clear whether the administration intends to exempt existing green card holders, who are already approved for lawful permanent residency.\n\nThe Trump administration this past week said it had canceled the green card of a Syrian-born former Columbia University graduate student of Palestinian descent, Mahmoud Khalil, because he had led high-profile campus protests against Israels war in Gaza that the government says were antisemitic, setting off a court fight over the legality of that move.\n\nSome of the countries on the draft red and orange lists were sanctioned by Mr. Trump in his first-term travel bans, but many are new. Some share characteristics with the earlier lists  they are generally Muslim-majority or otherwise nonwhite, poor and have governments that are considered weak or corrupt.\n\nBut the reason several others were included was not immediately clear. Bhutan, for example, was proposed for an absolute ban on entry. The small Buddhist and Hindu country is sandwiched between China and India, neither of which were on any of the draft lists.\n\nThe proposal to sharply restrict, if not outright ban, visitors from Russia raises a different issue. While the Russian government has a reputation for corruption, Mr. Trump has been trying to reorient U.S. foreign policy in a more Russia-friendly direction.\n\nA decision to include Venezuela could also disrupt a nascent thaw in relations that has been useful to Mr. Trumps separate efforts to deport undocumented migrants.\n\nThe proposal also includes a draft yellow list of 22 countries that would be given 60 days to clear up perceived deficiencies, with the threat of being moved onto one of the other lists if they did not comply.\n\nSuch issues could include failing to share with the United States information about incoming travelers, purportedly inadequate security practices for issuing passports, or the selling of citizenship to people from banned countries, which could serve as a loophole around the restrictions.\n\nThat list, the officials said, included Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Burkina Faso, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cape Verde, Chad, the Republic of Congo, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Dominica, Equatorial Guinea, Gambia, Liberia, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, So Tom and Prncipe, Vanuatu and Zimbabwe.\n\nDuring Mr. Trumps first term, courts blocked the government from enforcing the first two versions of his travel ban, but the Supreme Court eventually permitted a rewritten ban  one that banned citizens from eight nations, six of them predominantly Muslim  to take effect. The list later evolved.\n\nSoon after he became president in January 2021, Joseph R. Biden Jr. issued a proclamation revoking Mr. Trumps travel bans, calling them a stain on our national conscience and inconsistent with our long history of welcoming people of all faiths and no faith at all.\n\nMr. Trumps executive order in January said he would revive the bans in order to protect American citizens from aliens who intend to commit terrorist attacks, threaten our national security, espouse hateful ideology or otherwise exploit the immigration laws for malevolent purposes.\n\n",

The deceased was accompanied by two fellow ZimParks Rangers and a detail from the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) when they went to resupply at the Gatche-Gatche Irrigation Scheme, the authority added.\n\nThe authority further elaborated: While his colleagues were otherwise engaged, Ranger Mandishara returned to the harbour where their boat was docked.

He previously served in the role from 2010 to 2015, during the presidency of Barack Obama.\n\nSouth Africa is governed by the African National Congress (ANC), a party that emerged out of the anti-apartheid struggle that ended white minority rule in that country.\n\nBut its government has been a target of particular ire for the Trump administration and allies like right-wing billionaire Elon Musk, who is of South African origin.\n\nTrumps government has accused the ANC government of discriminating against its white population.\n\nTrump has nixed aid to South Africa and, in February  at a time when the White House had almost entirely shuttered refugee admissions for people fleeing violence and repression around the world  Trump offered expedited citizenship for white Afrikaners escaping government-sponsored race-based discrimination.\n\nThe announcement was a response to a land distribution law meant to address inequalities that have continued since the apartheid era. The South African government says that Trump is misinformed about the law, which has not been used to confiscate any land.\n\nVincent Magwenya, a spokesperson for South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, told the Reuters news agency that his country was not going to partake in a counterproductive megaphone diplomacy  referring to Trumps propensity for issuing missives about South Africa on social media.\n\nDespite Trumps portrayal of Afrikaners as a besieged minority, South African authorities say that the economic legacy of apartheid, during which white South Africans exercised near-total control over the economy, persists in continued levels of economic inequality between Black and white residents.\n\nA 2017 government audit found that while Black people make up 80 percent of the population of South Africa, they own just 4 percent of privately held farmland.\n\nThe white Afrikaners who own the vast majority of South Africas farmland comprise a mere 8 percent of the population.\n\nRasool and his family were themselves expelled from their home in Cape Town during the apartheid period, when Black people were forcibly relocated to designated non-white areas with almost no resources or economic opportunities.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZANU PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa has been secretly recorded laying into Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, whom he argues is a cruel, unelectable and uneducated leader who has failed to grasp the difference between letters R and L.\n\nThe audio, part of United Kingdom-based investigative unit Dug Ups latest effort, opens a window into worsening factional fights between President Emmerson Mnangagwa and Chiwenga.\n\nA former army general and arguably the most loved man in Zimbabwe after toppling late President Robert Mugabe in November 2017, Chiwengas presidential aspirations have set him on a collision course with his former allies, who include Mutsvangwa and Mnangagwa.\n\nAccording to Mutsvangwa, Chiwenga and Mnangagwas tiff is centred on the next Zanu PF elective congress at which Chiwenga seemingly does not want to be challenged for the position of party first secretary and President.\n\nZanu PF national spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa\n\nHe wants to be endorsed, whereas Mnangagwa is maintaining that he should enter into a popularity contest against any other individual who might be interested in leading the party and standing as its candidate in 2028.\n\nThis guy wants to be anointed as the Presidents successor. He wants to remove him but while in the process of removing him he is saying the President should anoint him. How do you do that? Mutsvangwa can be heard speaking over the phone.\n\nMugabe used to nominate his deputies but this time number one is saying we must go for elections and that is normal for a democratic party.\n\nAn endorsement by Mnangagwa will all but quash any hopes of successfully contesting the seat against him.\n\nAll this is based on assumptions that Mnangagwa himself does not choose to extend his tenure beyond the 2028 constitutional limit as is being called for by various chapters within the party.\n\nOne of the stains on Chiwengas ambitious plans of leading the country, according to Mutsvangwa, is how he has handled his ex-wife Marry Mubaiwa.\n\nMubaiwa, who suffers from acute lymphoedema and has had some limbs cut off, stands accused of attempting to kill the former army commander.\n\nShe has been in and out of court for over three years, her passport held at the courts as she is being denied an opportunity to undergo life saving treatment outside the country.\n\nAdded Mutsvangwa: Can you imagine, half of the electorate are women in this country and you have decapitated the limbs of your former wife through cruelty and you are refusing her to see the children, including the ones she came to you with.\n\nWhen Number One tries to pardon her, you refuse. He reeks of cruelty against all women in the country, he cannot win so he does not want elections, but the president has upended him and told him to sell himself to the electorate.\n\nUnconfirmed reports have always referred to an unwritten pact between Mnangagwa and Chiwenga wherein the latter was promised State leadership after the former.\n\nThis plan, reportedly hampered in 2023, looks more likely to be fought again as 2028 approaches.\n\nMutsvangwa, a learned diplomat, clearly does not rate Chiwenga in the audio. Besides that he is relatively new to the party, his lack of academic wit, according to the former Presidential advisor, is a sign of ignorance.\n\nIf you want to know that a Shona speaking person did not go to school ask that they pronounce the letter L, Mutsvangwa goes on.\n\nThe letter R comes from the mother, the L comes from a teacher, that is the basic litmus test of an illiterate Shona person.\n\nHe never managed to graduate from the mothers alphabet. Going to war is no substitute for illiteracy and ignorance, we went to war from universities.\n\nThe full investigation, presented by journalist Maynard Manyowa is available on YouTube.\n\n",

These youngmen, commonly referred to as Mano (Elder Brother) have added onto the growing list of illegal vendors on Harares streets.\n\nThe general economy is playing against us; we have been playing hide-and-seek after vendors, and it is not working, said Chonzi.\n\nHeavy handedness is expected as has been evident in past operations such as Operation Murambatsvina in the early 2000s when slums, illegal structures and vending stalls were razed down by both government and council.\n\nBecause of this expectation, National Peace and Reconciliation Commission (NPRC) Commissioner Obert Gutu preached restraint, urging enforcers to realise that those on the streets were not there out of their own will but circumstances.\n\nBy late Friday evening, there was no evidence that municipal police and the ZRP had started their programme.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nZIMBABWEs 2025 budget allocation of US$44 million for medicines is deplorably insufficient, as the country requires at least US$17 million per month.\n\nFor years, the government has been struggling to provide basic supplies at public hospitals, with health professionals receiving poor salaries.\n\nThe healthcare crisis is expected to worsen as international donors like the USAID and UKAID, may withdraw their funding.\n\nUSAID has already suspended funding for all activities pending review, while UKAID announced a significant budget cut to its international assistance.\n\nAddressing a press conference Friday on his ministrys achievements, Health and Child Care Minister Douglas Mombeshora revealed that the US$17 million required is still inadequate, as it only covers the most essential supplies.\n\nAccording to the minister the whole year budget only covers about three months if the required budget is to be met.\n\nMombeshora stated that the ministry is in negotiations with the Treasury to increase the budget amid declining external assistance.\n\nThe country requires approximately US$17 million worth of medicines monthly. The figure only covers the most essential medicines.\n\nThe availability of essential medicines increased from 22% in 2023 to around 50% in 2024. The increase in availability has largely been due to greater investment in medicines.\n\nFor instance, there are currently two main medicine supply contracts: Intrapharma (around US$24 million) and Clean Planet (around US$17 million).\n\nIn 2023, the government allocated about US$52 million for medicines. In 2025, the government committed approximately US$44 million toward medicines.\n\nThere are ongoing negotiations with the Treasury to increase the health budget in light of dwindling external support, Mombeshora said.\n\nZimbabwes health sector is generally underfunded and relies heavily on the benevolence of Western development partners.\n\n",
