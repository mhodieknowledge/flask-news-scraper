There is a lot of history between me and him and several other Zambians, I did my education in Zambia, of course he was junior, Mnangagwa stated.\n\nHowever, this assertion has been met with scepticism, with critics quick to point to what they perceive as a series of legal missteps made by the President since assuming office in November 2017.\n\nThese alleged blunders have fuelled doubts about the extent of Mnangagwas legal knowledge and background.\n\nExamples cited include early constitutional gaffes, such as ministerial appointments made outside the bounds of Parliament. The public was obliged to remind him of his overreach, forcing him to rescind his decisions.\n\nFurther scrutiny arose when, during the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, in 2018, Mnangagwa appeared to announce the 2018 elections for May, a date predating the constitutional earliest possible polling day of July 23, 2018.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, shortly after taking office, Mnangagwa issued an ultimatum to those accused of externalising US dollars and assets, demanding they return the loot or face prosecution. This was despite the absence of any Zimbabwean law criminalising such activity at the time, a move widely interpreted as a significant oversight.\n\nThese early missteps have left many questioning the Presidents legal prowess.\n\nDespite the Presidents assertion, critics remain unconvinced. They point to a lack of tangible evidence, noting the absence of photographs or verifiable accounts from alleged classmates to support the claim of a shared legal education.\n\nThe claim, they argue, rests solely on Mnangagwas oral tradition.\n\nDespite the controversy, Mnangagwa further described Lungu as a leader of foresight in terms of development and said his passing represented a significant loss not only for Zambia but for the region as a whole.\n\nWe have lost one of our illustrious leaders he was committed not only to Zambia but to the rest of the region he was one of us he was a man who had foresight in terms of development and collaboration between several countries, he said.\n\nLungu lost the Zambian elections to Hakainde Hichilema in August 2021.\n\nHe has since reportedly enjoyed a close relationship with Zanu PF, with some suggesting Mnangagwas party was funding a potential comeback bid in Zambias 2026 elections, a claim both parties vehemently denied.\n\n",
