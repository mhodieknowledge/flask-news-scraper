            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nGIRLS in Zimbabwes marginalised communities are increasingly being married off as a desperate survival tactic by families grappling with the impact of climate change.\n\nZimbabwe is one of the countries in Africa hardest hit by the climate change phenomenon, which has resulted in hunger, poverty and displacement.\n\nSpeaking during a recent parliamentary session, Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) Member of Parliament for Mashonaland West Mutsa Murombedzi said some of these vulnerable girls are being married off for food.\n\nRecently in Mutoko, a bright Form 2 pupil dropped out of school to marry a man twice her age, because the parents could no longer pay school fees.\n\nThe same situation was in Gokwe where a 13-year-old was removed from school after Grade 7 results came out. She was married off for groceries and a few blankets.\n\nThese girls wanted to be teachers, nurses and to be Members of Parliament. Instead, they are burdened by early pregnancies and unpaid work, Murombedzi said.\n\nEvery climate disaster resets families to survival mode, where girls are the first to be sacrificed.\n\nMurombedzi also urged Parliament to find ways to mitigate the climate change crisis as a way to save young girls from child marriages.\n\nWe must also recognise that climate change has become a threat multiplier that fuels child marriages in Zimbabwe and across Africa.\n\nClimate change is not just an environmental crisis, it is a social and gendered crisis.\n\nIn seasons of drought when crops fail and livestock die, many families are pushed deeper into desperation, parents facing hunger and unable to pay school fees and are often seen marrying off their daughter as a coping mechanism to reduce households mouth to feed or to obtain a bride price for survival.\n\nTo break this cycle, we must act on several fronts. We have to strengthen the enforcement of the law.\n\nUnless we tackle the climate crisis and build resilience in our communities, through irrigation schemes, drought-resistant crops and social safety nets, our efforts to end child marriage will be undermined, Murombedzi said.\n\nAccording to the government, last year over 3,400 girls were forced out of school as a result of early marriages and adolescent pregnancies.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nFORMER Highlanders coach Kelvin Kaindu is poised for a sensational return to Zimbabwe as he is close to signing a deal with fading giants Dynamos in a technical shake-up at the embattled Castle Lager Premier Soccer League side.\n\nKaindu is set to replace Saul Chaminuka, who is on his way out of Dynamos after struggling to steer the Harare giants out of the murky waters in which they find themselves.Chaminuka replaced Lloyd Chigowe at the helm of Dynamos in May but only managed to win once, against Yadah FC at Rufaro, in a match where they stumbled to victory by luck.Under Chaminuka, Dynamos have not scored a goal in the past six matches and have collected just two points, remaining winless and leaving the side occupying the 17th spot on the PSL table.As a result, Dynamos are facing the embarrassing prospect of relegation if their fortunes do not change.Without disclosing much, an insider confirmed that Dynamos are at an advanced stage of negotiations with Kaindu.We have shown Chaminuka the exit door. It was about time that he had to go. It appears it was a mistake appointing him as coach. Dynamos is a big institution that has outgrown even its founding members, and it needs someone with a higher pedigree.

Across the world and even here in Africa, the change has been seen. Countries are working very hard.\n\nMumba urged policymakers and responsible stakeholders to make decisions and adopt policies that prioritize wetland protection.\n\nLet us make this moment where political leadership meets practical action, when commitments become implementation, and where wetlands are finally recognized as the backbone of sustainability, she added.\n\nYan Zhen, deputy head of Chinas National Forestry and Grassland Administration, noted that in recent years, China has continuously improved its legal and institutional framework for wetland conservation, comprehensively protected wetland ecosystems, and actively engaged in international cooperation, continuously contributing to global wetland protection efforts.\n\nThe Chinese delegation said they will engage in open dialogue to share experiences and build consensus with all contracting parties to help produce meaningful and impactful outcomes from the conference.\n\n",
