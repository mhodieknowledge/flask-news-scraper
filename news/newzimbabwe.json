            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) finds itself once again locking horns with university authorities, this time demanding the reinstatement of members suspended from state universities.\n\nThe union is accusing three universities, Midlands State University (MSU), Great Zimbabwe University (GZU) and the University of Zimbabwe (UZ) of what it calls a flagrant violation of both domestic and international human rights law.\n\nThe suspended students stand accused of breaching conduct regulations, allegedly brandishing placards on campus and calling for a resolution to the ongoing lecturers strike.\n\nIn a letter dated 7 July 2025, and served to the students on Tuesday, UZ Vice Chancellor Paul Mapufmo stated that the six had contravened rule 3.1.4 of the Rules of Student Conduct and Discipline, 1984 Ordinance 30, by moving around campus inciting fellow students to join the lecturers protests.\n\nIt was brought to my attention that on the 12th of May 2025 at around 1210 hours, while in the company of Blessing Mtisi, Nodeshar Maingehama, Tafadzwa Katsande Masimba, Tawananyasha Hove and Mtukura Tariro were found holding unlawful demonstration at the University Halls of Residence.\n\nYou were moving one hall of residence to another, one dining hall to another, addressing fellow students and inciting them to join you to hold placards and chant slogans against the University Administration.\n\nAccordingly in light of the seriousness of the allegations detailed above, I have found it necessary to, in terms of section 8 (3) (e) of the University of Zimbabwe Act,[ Chapter 25:16], (the act) to suspend you with immediate effect, from your studies at the University of Zimbabwe indefinitely pending disciplinary hearing against you.\n\nIn response, ZINASU President Emmanuel Sitima issued three key demands, asserting that Mapfumos actions reflect a deliberate and systematic effort to criminalise dissent and suppress the agency of students as political and civic actors.\n\nSuch repressive conduct is not only morally indefensible, but legally unsustainable. The Constitution of Zimbabwe (2013), which stands as the supreme law of the Republic, guarantees the freedom of expression (Section 61), freedom of assembly and association (Section 58), and the right to peaceful demonstration and petition (Section 59), said Sitima.\n\nSitima further insisted that the suspended students must be reinstated immediately and without conditions.\n\nThe immediate and unconditional reinstatement of all students unlawfully suspended or expelled. A thorough and independent investigation into the abuse of university disciplinary procedures for political ends. Firm guarantees from the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education affirming the protection of student rights in accordance with the Constitution, he declared.\n\nThe dispute comes as UZ lecturers have been on strike since April, demanding fair wages. At one point, even President Emmerson Mnangagwas spokesman, George Charamba, conceded that the US$230 being offered to lecturers at UZ was a concern, pledging that his boss had approved salary increments.\n\nThe university has responded to the industrial action by suspending protesting lecturers and replacing them with what students are derisively calling virgins in the academic setting, ill-equipped to handle the demands of the job.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/lithium-smuggling-rampant-as-zimbabwe-fails-to-end-corruption/",
            "content": "By Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThis story was originally published by theGlobal Press Journal.\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  In 2023, Peter, a truck driver, was approaching a border checkpoint between Zimbabwe and Mozambique. He had little reason to question what was in his trucks sealed container  hed transported shipments for this Chinese-owned company before.\n\nWe just thought everything was in order, he says.\n\nBut rather than chrome, the mineral listed on the containers paperwork, inspectors found raw lithium. By law, unprocessed lithium shouldnt leave Zimbabwe without written permission from the minister of mines and mining development. Peter didnt have that. Border officials impounded the truck and trailer  worth more than US$50,000  for a year. Drape Trucking, the company where Peter works, recovered it after paying a US$5,000 fine.\n\nZimbabwe, which boasts Africas largest lithium reserves, is poised to help meet global demand in the race to secure green energy and develop advanced technology. Its production pales in comparison to powerhouses like Australia and Chile, but the country is still among the top-eight producers of the mineral, producing 1,200 tons in 2021 alone.\n\nBut as demand grows, so does illegal trading. In Zimbabwe, some companies mislabel shipments or underreport the quality and quantity of lithium exports. Border officials  either unaware or complicit  allow the shipments to slip through, undermining efforts to regulate one of Zimbabwes most valuable exports.\n\nPeter asked that Global Press Journal use only his first name, and he did not share the name of the company responsible for the shipping containers contents. He provided the name of the owner of the company, but Global Press Journal was not able to verify the involvement of anyone by that name in the industry.\n\nTendai, a former border agent, says hes accepted bribes to allow lithium shipments to pass through the border. Tendai confirmed the incident involving Peter and says he was arrested and fined for his role. Like many other sources who spoke to Global Press Journal for this article, he asked not to use his full name for fear of losing his job.\n\nIn 2022, Zimbabwe banned the export of raw lithium to curb smuggling and extract more value, since the law would force mining companies to process lithium domestically. Since then, some of the largest lithium mining companies in the country, such as Arcadia and Bikita Minerals, have set up processing operations.\n\nData on whether these regulations have generated more revenue is hard to find. Official records show that the countrys lithium production capacity surged by 230% between 2022 and 2023. Most of the product ends up in China, which controls 90% of Zimbabwes mining sector. Even so, the ban has done little to contain lithium smuggling across Zimbabwes porous borders.\n\nThe regulations are ineffective, says Gorden Moyo, director of the Public Policy and Research Institute of Zimbabwe. Officials, including members of security services, who collude with politicians and foreign governments, particularly China, facilitate illegal exports, he says.\n\nNomsa Jane Moyo, the general manager at the Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe, a parastatal group that inspects exports, says the organization closely monitors mining at all stages to ensure that companies export the quantities and qualities they declare. They intercept those who skirt the law, she says.\n\nThe government seized 22 lithium shipments in 2023 and 23 in 2024. Some were seized before reaching the borders; others were flagged by officials at the Forbes border post, between Zimbabwe and Mozambique, and the Beitbridge border post, between Zimbabwe and South Africa.\n\nA sign marks the entrance to Prospect Lithium Zimbabwes processing plant in Goromonzi. Despite government efforts to curb smuggling, former border officials say companies conceal high-grade lithium and bribe authorities to export unprocessed minerals. Most of the countrys lithium ends up in China and Hong Kong. Credit: Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nAccording to the Minerals Marketing Corporation, in 2023, the country sold a total of 769,086 metric tons of lithium, valued at US$794 million and produced by two main lithium mining companies, Prospect Lithium Zimbabwe and Bikita Minerals. Two-thirds of these minerals went to either China (59%) or Hong Kong (7%), according to United Nations trade data.\n\nBut these figures dont reflect the true volume of lithium leaving Zimbabwe, says Tendai, the former border agent. Lithium export permits are issued with a fixed limit for how much a company can export, so companies often underreport, he says.\n\nIt all starts at the mines, where officials claim to closely monitor activities, says Tatenda, an employee at Prospect Lithium Zimbabwe who asked that Global Press Journal use only his first name for fear of losing his job.\n\nTatenda says the company undervalues high grades of lithium. And while the ministry of mines carries out inspections, he says, the high-quality lithium is concealed beneath lower-value ore to mislead inspectors.\n\nGlobal Press Journal made several attempts to speak to Prospect Lithium Zimbabwe. Officials indicated that they would comment but did not respond to subsequent requests.\n\nNomsa Jane Moyo, from the Minerals Marketing Corporation, says the lithium quality tests theyve carried out at Prospect Lithium Zimbabwe meet all legal requirements.\n\nTendai, the former border agent, says the mining companies sometimes bypass shipment records by bribing not only border officials but also officers from the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority or the Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe and others within the export chain.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Revenue Authority did not respond to multiple requests for an interview, and Nomsa Jane Moyo did not respond to allegations of corruption within the Minerals Marketing Corporation.\n\nCorruption facilitates smuggling, but some border officials dont always know what theyre inspecting, says Levious Chiukira, a customs and trade consultant at Gleam Customs and Clearing Agency.\n\nI worked as a customs official for years, yet I cannot differentiate between petalite and lepidolite, both of which are forms of lithium, he says. [The revenue authority] does not employ geologists, and there is no institutional capacity to address this knowledge gap.\n\nPiles of lithium at a mine in Mutoko. Zimbabwe banned the export of unprocessed lithium in 2022, but weak enforcement and corruption have allowed smuggling to continue. Credit: Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nExporters exploit the regulatory gaps, Gorden Moyo says. While corruption is punishable by law in China, when they operate abroad, they act with impunity.\n\nThe government hasnt helped. Contracts between the state and investors are not accessible to the public, according to a report by the Africa Policy Research Institute. It erodes public trust, says Tafara Chiremba, an environmentalist at the Zimbabwe Environmental Lawyers Association.\n\nBecause of the smuggling, Chiremba says, its China, not Zimbabwe, that benefits from the countrys wealth of lithium.\n\nLinda Mujuruis a Reporter-in-Residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.
