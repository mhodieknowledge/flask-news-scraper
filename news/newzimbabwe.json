Why is that the case?The ANC supported and enabled Zanu PF and FRELIMO. These parties looted their nations, causing mass poverty. They rigged elections, but instead of condemning those results, the ANC endorsed them, said Maimane in a post on X.Foreigners in South Africa, particularly Zimbabweans, have in recent weeks faced discrimination when seeking medical assistance in public facilities.The problems in our hospitals and clinics are a result of the dictatorship in Zimbabwe. Those thugs who run that country stole everythingincluding elections. We must be honest about this part of the issue.We need stronger borders, but lets be clear: unless we deal with the root causes of the problemZanu PF and FRELIMOwe will not solve these challenges.Let us also be aware that some are trying to bury their own failures under the guise of immigration, said Maimane further.South Africa is home to over two million Zimbabweans who have crossed the Limpopo River, fleeing economic collapse.Maimane urged South Africa to hold Zimbabwes government accountable for human rights violations.This problem must be addressed at the foreign policy level. We must stop supporting these corrupt parties and their dictatorships. We need to demand free and fair elections in every SADC nation.We must hold election riggers accountable.

We must stop supporting these corrupt parties and their dictatorships. We need to demand free and fair elections in every SADC nation.We must hold election riggers accountable. We must push for electoral reforms before those elections are due. The ANC must realise there is a new revolution in Africa.The oppressed are now being oppressed by Zanu PF and FRELIMO. They are not the good guys anymorethey are part of the problem, said Maimane.\n\nMaimane argues this stems from the failing political and economic systems of Zimbabwe and Mozambique, which he attributes to questionable election conduct and corruption.\n\nThe ANC supported two corrupt parties in the SADC region, and as those countries failed, their citizens came to South Africasome through legal routes, others illegally.The two largest immigrant populations in South Africa are from Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Why is that the case?The ANC supported and enabled Zanu PF and FRELIMO. These parties looted their nations, causing mass poverty. They rigged elections, but instead of condemning those results, the ANC endorsed them, said Maimane in a post on X.Foreigners in South Africa, particularly Zimbabweans, have in recent weeks faced discrimination when seeking medical assistance in public facilities.The problems in our hospitals and clinics are a result of the dictatorship in Zimbabwe. Those thugs who run that country stole everythingincluding elections. We must be honest about this part of the issue.We need stronger borders, but lets be clear: unless we deal with the root causes of the problemZanu PF and FRELIMOwe will not solve these challenges.Let us also be aware that some are trying to bury their own failures under the guise of immigration, said Maimane further.South Africa is home to over two million Zimbabweans who have crossed the Limpopo River, fleeing economic collapse.Maimane urged South Africa to hold Zimbabwes government accountable for human rights violations.This problem must be addressed at the foreign policy level.
