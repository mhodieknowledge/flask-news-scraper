Those who reported to have run out are probably the phase one, which are US$15 and phase two are US$15. We had a limited number of phase one tickets.\n\nI would advise fans to buy tickets early because on the day of the show, the value will be different from the phase two one, Chimbodza told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nWinky D, who has become a voice for the socially marginalised, is expected to engage intimately with his fans, tackling social ills, a theme that has endeared him to his supporters in the past.\n\nHowever, the dancehall star has kept fans in suspense over whether he will release a new album.\n\nHis last album, Eureka Eureka, released in 2023, was laden with social commentary, which ruffled the social and political elites.\n\n",

Authorities say the pronouncements were false, unlawful, and intended to cause psychological harm to foreign nationals and economic damage to Zimbabwe.\n\nLater the same day, Mandizvidza allegedly misled Chief Inspector Fidios Chiteure into believing he had been authorised by a senior commissioner to use a Ford Ranger, registration number ZRP 1033R.\n\nThe vehicle was driven to Waerera village in Bindura, where it was later recovered.\n\nOn 14 August 2025, the accused allegedly uploaded another video repeating his claim to be the ZRP commander, this time naming Commissioner General Stephen Mutamba  the actual police chief  in what the State says was a deliberate bid to sow disaffection among serving officers.\n\nThe state is opposing bail.\n\nIn his affidavit, the Investigation Officer Edmore Nyazamba opposed bail, warning that Mandizvidzas release would undermine and jeopardise the objectives and proper functioning of the criminal justice system.\n\nHe said the magnitude of the sentence likely to be passed upon conviction will induce him to abscond.\n\nThe sense of peace and security of foreign investors in Zimbabwe will be undermined and prejudiced by the release of the accused.\n\nNyazamba warned the court that if granted bail, Mandizvidza was highly likely to delete the YouTube account he used, thereby destroying crucial evidence.\n\nVakayi Chikwekwe is presiding over the case while Anesu Chirenje is prosecuting.\n\n",

Poverty-induced school dropout continues unabated, and early and forced marriages, often driven by cultural and religious norms, further limit girls life choices.\n\nTo the UN and International Community, support independent civic education and electoral participation programs that equip women and girls with the tools to engage meaningfully in public life and facilitate capacity-building programs for law enforcement, the judiciary, and public officials on gender-sensitive governance and human rights-based approaches, ZimRights added.\n\nZimRights also urged the government of Zimbabwe to enforce stronger institutional accountability, prosecution of political violence against women, improved access to basic services, expanded support for survivors of gender-based violence, and stricter enforcement of child marriage laws to advance womens rights.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has reopened a bitter family battle over a multimillion-dollar lottery windfall after granting rescission of a default judgment against three members of the Sakala family, ruling that the dispute be heard on the merits.\n\nThe case stems from a 2019 jackpot win by the late Agnes Sakala, who shared her winnings with relatives through cash, houses, and vehicles.\n\nThe beneficiaries, including Heather Magodyo and brothers Prosper and Henry Sakala, insist the transfers were outright gifts, but Agnes later claimed they were loans that should be repaid  triggering a lawsuit that has torn the family apart.\n\nThe applicants failed to attend the initial hearing in October 2024 after their lawyers abandoned the case, leading the court to rule in favour of respondent Oliver Masomera (in his capacity as the appointed executor dative of the Estate Late Agnes Sakala DR 3480/23).\n\nBut Justice Joel Mambara, sitting at the Harare High Court, overturned that outcome, stressing that the default judgment had been unjust.\n\nDenying the applicants the opportunity to be heard could result in an injustice, the judge said.\n\nThere is nothing in the applicants conduct to suggest that they freely took the decision to refrain from appearing.\n\nThe judge also rejected arguments by the respondents that the Sakalas were negligent and had wilfully defaulted. The explanation they have offered is adequate, Mambara ruled, citing a communication breakdown caused by changes in legal representation.\n\nCentral to the rescission was whether the disputed transfers were gifts or loans  a question the court said required a full trial.\n\nA court is naturally reluctant to let a judgment stand against someone who insists they have a valid defence and who was not heard due to a mishap, Justice Mambara noted.\n\nThe justice of the case clearly favours letting this matter be heard on the merits, Mambara concluded.\n\nThe matter will now proceed to trial, with significant implications for how courts interpret family transactions tied to sudden wealth, such as lottery winnings.\n\nThe underlying dispute between the parties arises from a family financial transaction.\n\nThe late Agnes Sakala (the first respondent) came into a significant sum of money after winning a lottery in 2019.\n\nShe shared a portion of her winnings with members of her family, including the late Mr. Aaron Sakala and his family, who are the applicants herein, by way of gifts of money, houses, and motor vehicles. In particular, the first applicant states that the money given to her family was not a loan but an outright gift, and thus no repayment was ever expected.\n\nSometime later, a dispute arose when the first respondent claimed entitlement to repayment or to certain property, treating what was given as a loan rather than a gift.\n\nThis led him to issue a summons against the applicants.\n\nThe applicants duly entered an appearance to defend the action, as they maintain that the first respondents claim is without merit.\n\nThe matter did not proceed to trial promptly.\n\nAccording to the first applicant, the case lay dormant for an extended period after pleadings.\n\nCrucially, the legal practitioner who had been handling the matter for the first applicant left the law firm which was handling this matter during this lull and failed to transfer or properly hand over the case file to any other practitioner in the firm.\n\nMeanwhile, the second and third applicants (Prosper and Henry Sakala) were being represented by a different law firm.\n\nAt the time the action was commenced, the second and third applicants were minors, and they had little to no direct contact with their lawyer. They allege they were never informed of any hearing date by that lawyer.\n\nIn October 2024, the first respondent set the matter down for a default judgment hearing on the unopposed roll.\n\nNotice of the set down was served, but due to the above circumstances, none of the applicants nor their legal representatives became aware of the hearing.\n\nThe first applicants former lawyer was no longer at his firm, and no one there was actively handling the file.\n\nThe other applicants lawyer, on the other hand, had not kept them informed and did not attend.\n\nAs a result, when the case was called on 21 October 2024, the applicants were in default of appearance.\n\nThe High Court (sitting in default) granted judgment in favour of the first respondent, thereby giving him the relief he sought in the action.\n\nThe applicants state that they only learned of the default judgment weeks later, when a relative privy to the court outcome informed them.\n\nThey moved with haste to engage new legal counsel and prepared this rescission application, which was filed in November 2024.\n\nThe application was thus made within one month of the applicants gaining knowledge of the default judgment, satisfying the temporal requirement of Rule 27(1).\n\nThe applicants also obtained a provisional stay of execution pending the determination of this rescission application, given that the default judgment involved the transfer of substantial assets.\n\n",
