            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nDESPERATE Harare vendors trying to earn a living from importing and selling of second-hand clothing have defied governments directive by simply ignoring orders to leave the streets.\n\nLocal Government Minister Daniel Garwe a fortnight ago banned the importation and sale of second-hand clothes along the streets as well as trading during the night.Vendors have continued operating the streets of Harare, ignoring the order by the Minister, preferring to do business at night when municipal officers are off the streets.Some of the affected vendors who spoke to NewZimbabwe.com lamented the economic collapse, which they said had worsened over the past few months, hence were resorting to importation of goods, mainly bales of second hand clothes for resale to earn a living.We are unemployed. We need some formal jobs so that we can leave the streets. Its difficult to remain in-doors at home when you have no basics such as food, Rudo Murotsi of Mufakose said.One Leroy Kufa from Glen View Area 8, a university graduate from Class of 2015, said he had never been employed after leaving college, turning to vending since then but had managed to send his siblings to school.So, how are we going to survive? Kufa asked rhetorically.During the 2024 Local Authorities Performance Outcome feed back workshop in Harare last Thursday, Garwe reiterated the ban and ordered council officials countrywide to make sure that all cities, towns and growth points chuck off vendors by December this year.Lets just accept that we created these problems. We must be able to deal with these problems. We want to see clean cities.I want to see all the cities clean. I dont know how we are going to do it. At least by the end of this year, our cities must be clean.Everybody must be willing to come to Harare, to come to ulawayo, to go to Mutare, to go to Masvingo, from wherever they are outside our country. Lets clean our cities. This is our motto., Garwe said.Lets reintroduce the culture of cleanliness to citizens.And we also want to know that street vending and night vending are banned. Street vending and night vending are born out of the importation of second-hand clothing, which is banned. And the responsibility to remove these people from our streets and from operating at night is ours, said added.The minister took a swipe at night-vending alleging only abuse of drugs and substances takes place during the evenings along the streets of the capital city.There is no positive night vending that is taking place. Its all drugs and substance abuse behind that night vending.Who, in his rightful of mind, or in her rightful of mind, will wake up at 12 midnight or 1am and say to the wife, Im leaving, you know, Im going for shopping at 1am. Or a woman leaving her husband or boyfriend to say, look, Im sorry, I have to go. Im going for shopping now. There is nobody. So this narrative that people have nothing to do, we are messing up people, its all hogwash.We must make hard and tough decisions to clean these cities. There must be tough decisions. Both tough decisions, positive results will come out, he added.So, there is banning of second-hand clothing importation, subsequent banning of street vending, and subsequent banning of night vending.These are directives that are coming from His Excellency. We actually have a Statutory lnstrument through the Minister of Industry and Commerce to ban the importationWe dont need that anymore. We cant be in a country, or an area cant be defined by seeing people selling used clothes along the streets.Garwe said Zimbabwe cannot be a nation of people aspiring to wear second-hand clothing, adding the importation and sale of used clothes was killing the countrys cotton industry.\n\nLocal Government Minister Daniel Garwe a fortnight ago banned the importation and sale of second-hand clothes along the streets as well as trading during the night.\n\nVendors have continued operating the streets of Harare, ignoring the order by the Minister, preferring to do business at night when municipal officers are off the streets.Some of the affected vendors who spoke to NewZimbabwe.com lamented the economic collapse, which they said had worsened over the past few months, hence were resorting to importation of goods, mainly bales of second hand clothes for resale to earn a living.We are unemployed.

            "content": "By Dr. Sizo Nkala l IOL\n\nTHE Southern African Development Community (SADC) hosted its 45th Ordinary Summit of Heads of State and Government in Antananarivo, Madagascar at the weekend.\n\nThis years gathering was held under the theme: Advancing Industrialisation, Agricultural Transformation, and Energy Transition for a Resilient SADC.The Malagasy President Andriy Rajoelina assumed the rotational position of Chairperson from the Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who chaired the organisation since August 2025.Mnangagwas chairmanship faced its challenging moments, including the violence and instability in Mozambique following the holding of general elections in October 2024 and the ongoing conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Both issues, which have far-reaching implications on regional stability, were not satisfactorily handled.According to the Human Rights Watch (HRW), about 300 protesters lost their lives and hundreds more were injured as a result of the Mozambican security forces heavy-handed response to protests over the election outcomes. An extraordinary summit convened in November 2024, about a month after the elections, commended Mozambique for successfully holding peaceful elections and received an update from the then Mozambican president, Felipe Nyusi.He was not asked any questions about police violence against protesters. Neither were opposition parties invited to state their side of the case. The handling of the post-election violence in Mozambique made a mockery of the SADC Principles and Guidelines for Democratic Elections, whose standards the Mozambican elections did not live up to.The bar for the standard of elections in the region was already low, and the SADCs treatment of the Mozambican case buried the bar beneath the sand. As Malawi and Tanzania hold their general elections in September and October, respectively, they will not have any standards to hold themselves up to.Another glaring embarrassment for the organisation in the last term was the clumsy handling of the DRC issue.Less than six months after extending the SADC Mission in the DRC (SAMIDRC) by an additional year in November 2024, the organisation announced the withdrawal of the mission in May 2025. This, after 19 soldiers from the troop contributing countries, namely Malawi, Tanzania, and South Africa, lost their lives battling the M23 rebels at the behest of the DRC government.The mission exposed SADCs shortcomings in peacekeeping, including a shortage of equipment, personnel, and poor logistics, which greatly undermined the effectiveness of the deployed soldiers.Since withdrawing from the SAMIDRC, the organisation has struggled to assert itself diplomatically in negotiating a peace deal in the DRC. Its awkward partnership with the East African Community (EAC) in addressing the DRC conflict seems to have been overtaken and sidelined by Qatar and the US, who have managed to get a peace deal signed by Rwanda and the DRC while bringing the DRC government and the M23 to the negotiating table.The Summit came at a time when the regions relationship with the United States is under strain. All SADC countries, except Seychelles, are on the tariff list imposed by US President Donald Trump in August, which restricts member countries access to the US market.The new tariff rates range from 30 percent for South Africa to 10 percent for Eswatini. The US is a significant trade partner for the region, having taken in US$17.2 billion (about 5,93 percent) of SADC exports in 2023. The new development will hurt economic growth while tens of thousands of jobs are likely to be lost, particularly in countries like South Africa, Lesotho, and Madagascar, which have increased exposure to the US market.As such, there is a need for a concerted effort to accelerate regional integration and industrialisation efforts to forge resilient regional value chains that will shield the region from an unpredictable geopolitical environment. Although SADC is not a customs union, the fragmented response we have witnessed thus far to the US trade policies only puts the region at a disadvantage.Member states should consider ways of coordinating their responses to the US, which may increase their chances of getting a better deal. Other than trade, the US travel bans have affected three SADC countries following the suspension of visa services for Zimbabwe and the imposition of an exorbitant visa bond (US$5000-US$15000) for citizens of Malawi and Zambia wishing to travel to the US.These measures are an effective ban on citizens of the three countries from travelling to the US. On the other hand, Eswatini has agreed to a deal with the US to be a dumping ground for some of the most hardcore criminals being deported from the US.Recently, the Kingdom received five prisoners deported by the US, described by the US government as uniquely barbaric and depraved monsters. While entering into such a deal with the US is Eswatinis sovereign right, taking in prisoners who have committed heinous crimes, including murder and child rape, is a legitimate cause for concern for the security of neighbouring countries in the context of the regions porous borders.Meanwhile, the US is forging ahead with its controversial resettlement programme for white Afrikaner citizens of South Africa, whom it falsely claims are facing genocide.

As Malawi and Tanzania hold their general elections in September and October, respectively, they will not have any standards to hold themselves up to.Another glaring embarrassment for the organisation in the last term was the clumsy handling of the DRC issue.Less than six months after extending the SADC Mission in the DRC (SAMIDRC) by an additional year in November 2024, the organisation announced the withdrawal of the mission in May 2025. This, after 19 soldiers from the troop contributing countries, namely Malawi, Tanzania, and South Africa, lost their lives battling the M23 rebels at the behest of the DRC government.The mission exposed SADCs shortcomings in peacekeeping, including a shortage of equipment, personnel, and poor logistics, which greatly undermined the effectiveness of the deployed soldiers.Since withdrawing from the SAMIDRC, the organisation has struggled to assert itself diplomatically in negotiating a peace deal in the DRC. Its awkward partnership with the East African Community (EAC) in addressing the DRC conflict seems to have been overtaken and sidelined by Qatar and the US, who have managed to get a peace deal signed by Rwanda and the DRC while bringing the DRC government and the M23 to the negotiating table.The Summit came at a time when the regions relationship with the United States is under strain. All SADC countries, except Seychelles, are on the tariff list imposed by US President Donald Trump in August, which restricts member countries access to the US market.The new tariff rates range from 30 percent for South Africa to 10 percent for Eswatini. The US is a significant trade partner for the region, having taken in US$17.2 billion (about 5,93 percent) of SADC exports in 2023. The new development will hurt economic growth while tens of thousands of jobs are likely to be lost, particularly in countries like South Africa, Lesotho, and Madagascar, which have increased exposure to the US market.As such, there is a need for a concerted effort to accelerate regional integration and industrialisation efforts to forge resilient regional value chains that will shield the region from an unpredictable geopolitical environment. Although SADC is not a customs union, the fragmented response we have witnessed thus far to the US trade policies only puts the region at a disadvantage.Member states should consider ways of coordinating their responses to the US, which may increase their chances of getting a better deal. Other than trade, the US travel bans have affected three SADC countries following the suspension of visa services for Zimbabwe and the imposition of an exorbitant visa bond (US$5000-US$15000) for citizens of Malawi and Zambia wishing to travel to the US.These measures are an effective ban on citizens of the three countries from travelling to the US. On the other hand, Eswatini has agreed to a deal with the US to be a dumping ground for some of the most hardcore criminals being deported from the US.Recently, the Kingdom received five prisoners deported by the US, described by the US government as uniquely barbaric and depraved monsters. While entering into such a deal with the US is Eswatinis sovereign right, taking in prisoners who have committed heinous crimes, including murder and child rape, is a legitimate cause for concern for the security of neighbouring countries in the context of the regions porous borders.Meanwhile, the US is forging ahead with its controversial resettlement programme for white Afrikaner citizens of South Africa, whom it falsely claims are facing genocide. It is important for the region to send a unified response to the US to rebuff these outrageous claims.Dr. Sizo Nkala is a Research Fellow at the University of Johannesburgs Centre for Africa-China Studies.\n\nHe was not asked any questions about police violence against protesters.
