            "content": "By Sports Reporter\n\nThe Warriors World Cup Qualifiers campaign ended on a sour note after a 10 defeat to Lesotho at Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane, South Africa.\n\nThe loss saw Zimbabwe finish their Group C campaign as the only team without a single win.\n\nCoach Michael Nees made several changes to the lineup that faced South Africa on Friday, opting to rest captain Marvellous Nakamba and first-choice goalkeeper Washington Arubi.\n\nElvis Chipezeze started between the posts, while Jonah Fabisch took Nakambas place in midfield. Walter Musona, Bill Antonio, Emmanuel Jalai, and Brendon Galloway also returned to the starting eleven.\n\nThe first half offered little excitement, with both sides struggling to create clear chances. Zimbabwe suffered an early setback when Gerald Takwara was forced off with a head injury, replaced by Godknows Murwira.\n\nIn the second half, Nees introduced Nakamba for Fabisch, followed by Khama Billiat and Daniel Msendami for Walter Musona and Tawanda Chirewa, respectively.\n\nMsendami nearly made an impact in the 88th minute but missed a golden opportunity to put the Warriors ahead. Lesotho capitalised deep into stoppage time when Hlompo Kalake fired past Chipezeze in the 93rd minute to seal victory.\n\nThe defeat piles more pressure on Nees, who has managed just two wins, both against Namibia, since his appointment in July.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has ruled that businessman Murombo Josiah Mimana must continue supporting his estranged wife, Marvel Mtisi, with monthly maintenance after finding that he had the capacity to pay for the familys upkeep, previously pegged at US$20,000 per month.\n\nJustice Maxwell delivered the judgment on October 9, 2025, granting Mtisi maintenance of US$11,726 per month and ordering Mimana to contribute 80% of her legal costs pending the conclusion of their divorce proceedings.\n\nThe couple, married under an unregistered customary union in 2001, has eight children. Mtisi approached the court seeking a declaration that the marriage had ended and for Mimana to resume the US$20,000 monthly payments he allegedly stopped in February 2025, despite having consistently paid that amount since March 2024.\n\nMtisi told the court she was unemployed and had been excluded from the couples lucrative businesses, despite holding a 50% stake. She said the companies were financially sound, citing lucrative Jet A1 fuel supply contracts and profitable mining operations. She argued Mimana was well able to meet the US$21,936 in monthly expenses and contribute to her legal costs.\n\nMimana denied personally paying the US$20,000, claiming it was the company that had made the payments for the upkeep of the family. He accused Mtisi of failing to account for the funds and said payments stopped after she engaged in activities that disrupted the smooth running of the company.\n\nHe further disputed that she was a shareholder and insisted she was not entitled to dividends or business proceeds.\n\nBut in his ruling, Justice Fatima Maxwell found that Mimana had the means to continue supporting his wife, noting that even if the company had made the payments, it acted on his behalf.\n\nIt is common cause that the applicant has been dependent on the US$20,000 per month she was getting. The bottom line is that she has no source of income except the contribution she was receiving, the judge said.\n\nRespondent has not disputed that he is unilaterally running the company and that the US$20,000 was being paid on his behalf. He is therefore in a position to contribute to the applicants legal costs whether personally or through the company.\n\nThe court trimmed some nonrecurring and tutoring costs from Mtisis claim, disallowing US$10,210 in total, leaving US$11,726 as the payable monthly amount.\n\nOn Mimanas technical objection that Mtisis affidavit was improperly commissioned, the court described it as a desperate attempt by the respondent to avoid going into the merits of the matter.\n\nThe application for maintenance pendente lite and contribution towards costs be and is hereby granted,  she ruled.\n\n",

Emergency services, including paramedics, transport officers, and law enforcement officials, responded swiftly, recovering the deceased and transporting injured passengers to nearby hospitals.\n\nPremier Ramathuba is scheduled to visit the crash site at 11 am on Monday to meet the multi-disciplinary emergency team for updates. She will later address the media and visit hospitals where the injured are receiving care.\n\nThis is a heartbreaking tragedy. Losing so many lives in one incident is painful beyond words. On behalf of the Limpopo Provincial Government, we extend our deepest condolences to the affected families, including those in Zimbabwe and Malawi. We wish a full and speedy recovery to all survivors. Our thoughts and prayers are with them during this difficult time, Ramathuba said.\n\nEarlier, Limpopo Transport MEC Violet Mathye confirmed that the deceased included a 10-month-old baby. She said driver fatigue or a possible mechanical fault could have caused the bus to lose control, though investigations are ongoing.\n\nThe N1 freeway was temporarily closed following the crash. Motorists were advised to use alternative routes: from Makhado to Musina via the Witvlag turnoff, and from Musina to Makhado via the Williespoort turnoff.\n\nThe tragedy follows reports that the bus carried passengers from Zimbabwe and Malawi who were returning home for personal reasons. Rescue operations continued late into Sunday evening, with law enforcement and transport officials coordinating efforts alongside disaster management teams.\n\nThe Limpopo government is also providing psychosocial support to survivors and working with consular services from Zimbabwe and Malawi to assist affected families. Traffic authorities and the South African Police Service continue to investigate the cause of the crash.\n\n",

This programme focuses on repairing a significant portion of the road network, aiming to improve safety, stimulate economic activity, and connect communities to essential services like health, education, and markets.\n\nTo date, major road uplifts have been undertaken along the countrys major highways to revamp the countrys roads infrastructure.\n\nIn a statement, the MoTID announced that Glenara Road will not be accessible due to ongoing works.\n\nThe MoTID wishes to notify the motoring public and residents of the temporary partial closure of a section of Glenara Road to facilitate essential road rehabilitation works.\n\nAs part of the governments ongoing road infrastructure rehabilitation programme, this project aims to enhance road safety drainage and travel conditions for all users, said the ministry in a statement.\n\nThe affected section of Genara Road is between Service Station and Samora Machel Avenue will be partially closed to through traffic.\n\nMotorists travelling from ED Mnangagwa Road were advised to follow the designated detour, which proceeds via Glen Roy, turns onto Sloane Street, continues on Montgomery Road, then onto Rhodesville Avenue and finally rejoins Glenara Road via Samora Machel Avenue.\n\nProperties within the construction zone will remain accessible, with traffic management personnel on site to assist residents and businesses. To ensure the safety of all motorists and construction personnel and facilitate a smooth flow of traffic, the ministry strongly advises the public to obey all posted traffic signs and instruction from officials, drive with caution and at reduced speeds through the affected area, and allow for extra travel time to their schedules, the ministry added.\n\n",
