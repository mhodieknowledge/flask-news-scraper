            "content": "By Tapiwa Svondo\n\nOSCAR-nominated American film producer Alix Madigan concluded her week-long Business of Film workshop in Harare, urging the need for a number of formal structures to bolster Zimbabwes film industry.\n\nThe workshop, which was facilitated by the US Embassy, saw Madigan mentoring local filmmakers at the Zimbabwe Film and Television School of Southern Africa (ZIFTESSA).Speaking at the closeout ceremony on Friday, Madigan underscored the need for institutional support such as a film commission and tax incentives to complement the evident local talent.I do think that the future of filmmaking in Zimbabwe is very, very bright and will be very exciting in the years to come.I think if anything, I could recommend, is there be more formal structures in place to support these remarkable filmmakers that are present in this country, things such as the establishment of a film commission, the discussion of a possible tax incentive. But these things do seem to be well underway with the National Arts Council, said Madigan.Becca Archer-Knepper, Public Diplomacy Officer at the U.S. Embassy in Harare, added that challenges in the Zimbabwean film industry are forcing many creatives to pursue opportunities in other international film industries.However, she confirmed that meetings were held with the Ministry of Sport, Arts and Recreation and the National Arts Council to address these challenges.One of the major challenges is a lot of the very creative people end up going other places, whether they go to South Africa or Kenya, or Nigeria, or someplace in Europe or even America to work in the film industry because its more advanced there. And so I think one of the really great things about this workshop is that it brought together a lot of different filmmakers who are keen to build up the industry here in Zimbabwe.There are challenges, but Alix and Dorin Amina Abubakar, whos also on the programme with the American Film showcase, they met with the ministry, they met with the Arts Council, and they discussed different ideas about how they can strengthen the film industry here.There are simple things like making it easier to get film permits to more complex things, like setting up a film hub hub, giving tax breaks and things like that. So, there are some big things and some small things that could really change the film industry here, said Becca.Among the beneficiaries of the workshop was Kudakwashe Rice, a writer, poet, storyteller, and filmmaker, who shared his key takeaways of securing funding, distributing films, and generating returns.I benefited extremely from this programme that I was part of, which was facilitated by the U.S embassy, where they brought in Alix from the United States. Shes an incredible, incredible independent filmmaker, and she got to teach us about the professional aspect of filmmaking and the business aspect of filmmaking as well as being able to find ways where you get to fund your films and also putting your films into distribution and managing to get some returns from that, and to also get returns from that, said Rice.Filmmaker Yeukai Ndirimani, who began her career with Studio 263 in 2002, said the production of films in Zimbabwe is very low and there is little to no money in return.People argue whether we have an industry or not, but we have a community, and we are making films but the rate at which were making productions is very low, and hardly do we ever make money from our films.So this workshop was really very helpful, especially for me, because I am actually currently working on a few productions where I have been trying to find ways to sort of collaborate to to get money to then distribute that content because, its one thing to produce something its another to then get it seen I think my target audience is really like global, so I think this helps because they bring in that global sort of audience so the way that this workshop has helped is that, they have given us resources in terms of orgnisations where we can get our films screened, organisations that fund films people that can partner with us to make films, said Ndirimani.\n\nThe workshop, which was facilitated by the US Embassy, saw Madigan mentoring local filmmakers at the Zimbabwe Film and Television School of Southern Africa (ZIFTESSA).\n\nSpeaking at the closeout ceremony on Friday, Madigan underscored the need for institutional support such as a film commission and tax incentives to complement the evident local talent.I do think that the future of filmmaking in Zimbabwe is very, very bright and will be very exciting in the years to come.I think if anything, I could recommend, is there be more formal structures in place to support these remarkable filmmakers that are present in this country, things such as the establishment of a film commission, the discussion of a possible tax incentive.

And so I think one of the really great things about this workshop is that it brought together a lot of different filmmakers who are keen to build up the industry here in Zimbabwe.There are challenges, but Alix and Dorin Amina Abubakar, whos also on the programme with the American Film showcase, they met with the ministry, they met with the Arts Council, and they discussed different ideas about how they can strengthen the film industry here.There are simple things like making it easier to get film permits to more complex things, like setting up a film hub hub, giving tax breaks and things like that. So, there are some big things and some small things that could really change the film industry here, said Becca.Among the beneficiaries of the workshop was Kudakwashe Rice, a writer, poet, storyteller, and filmmaker, who shared his key takeaways of securing funding, distributing films, and generating returns.I benefited extremely from this programme that I was part of, which was facilitated by the U.S embassy, where they brought in Alix from the United States. Shes an incredible, incredible independent filmmaker, and she got to teach us about the professional aspect of filmmaking and the business aspect of filmmaking as well as being able to find ways where you get to fund your films and also putting your films into distribution and managing to get some returns from that, and to also get returns from that, said Rice.Filmmaker Yeukai Ndirimani, who began her career with Studio 263 in 2002, said the production of films in Zimbabwe is very low and there is little to no money in return.People argue whether we have an industry or not, but we have a community, and we are making films but the rate at which were making productions is very low, and hardly do we ever make money from our films.So this workshop was really very helpful, especially for me, because I am actually currently working on a few productions where I have been trying to find ways to sort of collaborate to to get money to then distribute that content because, its one thing to produce something its another to then get it seen I think my target audience is really like global, so I think this helps because they bring in that global sort of audience so the way that this workshop has helped is that, they have given us resources in terms of orgnisations where we can get our films screened, organisations that fund films people that can partner with us to make films, said Ndirimani.\n\nI think if anything, I could recommend, is there be more formal structures in place to support these remarkable filmmakers that are present in this country, things such as the establishment of a film commission, the discussion of a possible tax incentive. But these things do seem to be well underway with the National Arts Council, said Madigan.\n\nBecca Archer-Knepper, Public Diplomacy Officer at the U.S. Embassy in Harare, added that challenges in the Zimbabwean film industry are forcing many creatives to pursue opportunities in other international film industries.However, she confirmed that meetings were held with the Ministry of Sport, Arts and Recreation and the National Arts Council to address these challenges.One of the major challenges is a lot of the very creative people end up going other places, whether they go to South Africa or Kenya, or Nigeria, or someplace in Europe or even America to work in the film industry because its more advanced there.
