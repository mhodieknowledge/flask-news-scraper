            "content": "SundayWorld\n\nThe Pretoria High Court has delivered a historic ruling today, ordering the repatriation of former Zambian President Edgar Lungus body home for a state funeral, resolving a nearly two-month dispute that captivated the nation and resonated across southern Africa.\n\nLungu, who passed away on June 5 at Mediclinic Medforum in Pretoria during treatment for oesophageal cancer, will be laid to rest at Embassy Park in Lusaka with full military honours, as mandated by the court.\n\nThis is a matter of national dignity, said Acting Judge President Aubrey Ledwaba, delivering the ruling alongside a full bench. As a former head of state, President Lungus burial must reflect Zambias protocol and honour his service to the nation.\n\nThe decision followed a heated legal battle between the Zambian government, represented by Attorney General Mulilo Kabesha, and Lungus family, who insisted on a private burial in South Africa to honour the late Presidents alleged wish to exclude his political rival, President Hakainde Hichilema, from the proceedings.\n\nLungu, Zambias sixth president from 2015 to 2021, was a polarising figure whose death at age 68 sparked a controversy reflective of his contentious political career. His widow, Esther Lungu, and lawyer Makebi Zulu argued that Lungu had explicitly stated his wishes.\n\nMy husband was clear: he wanted President Hichilema nowhere near his funeral or his body, Esther Lungu stated in her affidavit.\n\nThe family cited past grievances, including the 2023 stripping of Lungus presidential benefits and alleged delays in approving his medical evacuation to South Africa, which they claim hastened his death.\n\nThe Zambian government, however, maintained that national law supersedes personal wishes. The burial of a former President is a state matter, as seen with President Kenneth Kaunda, Kabesha argued in court documents.\n\nThe government sought four key orders: a declaration of its exclusive right to repatriate Lungus body, the release of the body from a Pretoria funeral home to the Zambian High Commission, authorization for a state delegation to accompany the remains, and the exclusion of the familys authority over the burial process.\n\nThe court granted these requests but acknowledged the familys concerns. Judge Ledwaba noted: While we respect the familys sentiments, national protocol must prevail. We urge minimal involvement of President Hichilema to honour their wishes as far as possible.\n\nThe court dismissed an application by Zambian citizen Vincent Kafula to intervene. The applicant lacks the legal standing to influence this matter, said Ledwaba.\n\nKafula had warned that the dispute was tearing Zambia apart.\n\nThe court ordered Lungus body to be transported to Lusaka on a private chartered plane, where it will lie in state at his residence and a conference centre for public viewing before burial at Embassy Park.\n\n",

While in college, I launched a movie business through a deal with my university, which ignited my passion for entrepreneurship.\n\nDuring my industrial work experience, I started a condiments buying and selling business that eventually grew to the point of exporting to Zambia. After college, I briefly worked at Telecel, TelOne, and Zuva Petroleum in various managerial roles.\n\nThe leaders at TelOne and Zuva greatly influenced my development as a manager and leader, and I am grateful for their mentorship. My wife, who is also my business partner, has played a significant role in my journey. I am a firm believer in God, and I recognise that I wouldnt be where I am today without His mercy.\n\nQN:Walk us through how you launched your businesses and what inspired the journey.\n\nRM:I started my first business while in college by seizing a unique opportunity to run a movie venture. This experience taught me the importance of innovation and calculated risks. On industrial attachment at Dairibord, I started buying and selling condiments from work and exporting to Zambia.\n\nMy condiments business later flourished, allowing me to reinvest and explore further opportunities in education and technology, which ultimately led me to energy and the construction and real estate sectors, where I recognised significant potential to do much more across Africa.\n\nQN: What has managed to sustain your firms in this difficult economic environment?\n\nRM:Our resilience is rooted in our commitment to quality and innovation. We embrace learning and quickly adapt to change. By identifying the critical need for housing and infrastructure in Zimbabwe, we have focused on developing clusters and high-rise flats that maximise space and align with market demands. This strategic focus has enabled us to thrive even in challenging economic conditions.\n\nQN: You have expanded outside of the country. How has that experience been, and how are the firms performing abroad?\n\nRM:Expanding beyond Zimbabwe has been a rewarding experience, allowing us to tap into new markets and diversify our portfolio. Our firms abroad are performing well as we adapt our strategies to local needs while maintaining the high standards weve established. The Chartered Institute of Customer Management is now operating in 13 countries across Africa.\n\nQN: Your portfolio spans construction (Picco), education, energy, and more. How do you identify opportunities across such diverse sectors, and whats your strategy for scaling them?\n\nRM:Identifying opportunities across diverse sectors requires a keen understanding of market dynamics and trends. My previous work experience informs many of my ventures.\n\nI focus on thorough research and analysis to pinpoint market gaps. My strategy for scaling involves building strong partnerships, nurturing relationships, leveraging technology, and maintaining a customer-centric approach to meet the evolving needs of our clients.\n\n",

I think once you show people respect, they know you were raised well. Where you come from becomes a secondary issue.\n\nDespite cultural similarities, Awa Khiwe revealed that her upbringing in a Zimbabwean village in Nkayi prepared her for life in KwaNongoma.\n\nBeing raised in the village helped me shape my cultural identity. The KwaNongoma lifestyle is similar to that of Nkayi its not a huge adjustment.\n\nAwa Khiwe, renowned for championing Ndebele pride on global stages, has opened up about embracing a more traditional role in her personal life.\n\nNow living in a new home, the outspoken rapper revealed that while many know her as a fierce and fearless queen, she proudly takes on the role of being a loved,spoiled and submissive wife to her Zulu husband.\n\nSpeaking candidly, she said she respects both Zulu and Ndebele cultures, describing the union as a beautiful exchange rather than a clash.\n\nAwa said her open-mindedness allows her to find strength in unity and mutual respect, rather than division, even in deeply rooted cultural differences.\n\nVeteran actor Ernest Ndlovu joined Awa Khiwe in KwaNongoma to celebrate her wedding day. Image: Pixel Visuals\n\nWhile fans speculated that new music inspired by the wedding might be on the way, Awa was quick to set the record straight:\n\nI have new music, but it has nothing to do with the wedding, she said. I juggle music and family, Im old enough to handle the situation.\n\nHer husband, a Qwabe man involved in the construction industry, has been in her life for years. The two met through a mutual friend, Macingwana, and nurtured their relationship quietly before tying the knot in a ceremony that honoured both families.\n\nOn social media, she called it the best day of my life and added in a heartfelt tribute:\n\nThank you for keeping your promise, my love. I promise to love, honour, respect and protect you, till death do us part.\n\n",

We can not have a society that aspires to wear second-hand clothes. It is a serious oxymoron; we have cotton we can not make new clothes. So we wait for the cotton to be exported and clothes to be manufactured, and they are worn before we wear them.\n\nOn the other hand, we have some in our midst wearing second-hand clothes. We must assist each other as a society. We need to deal with it in a sensitive manner, but at the same time, we can not sustain a city based on second-hand clothes.\n\nDespite their importation ban by the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA), second-hand clothes have provided relief for cash-strapped individuals due to their affordability.\n\nThe ban on the importation of second-hand clothes was implemented by ZIMRA in 2015, but due to porous borders, they continue to flood the streets, being sold at cheaper prices.\n\nIn Harare, second-hand clothes are also sold at night, a practice the government is also banning.\n\nThe Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) has since condemned the move as autocratic, particularly in an economy reliant on the informal sector.\n\nThe Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) notes with deep concern the position taken by the Ministry of Local Government on banning the selling of second-hand clothing and street vending\n\nThis intervention by the Ministry of Local Government is a clear reflection of the failure of the implementation of devolution within the local authority, the decision was made from an autocratic position\n\nThe City of Harare has to run the operations within the City in accordance with Section 264 of the Constitution, the procedure should be done in accordance with the Constitution.\n\nThe informal sector has for years been complementing the formal sector as there has been an emergence of formal businesses operating 24/7 in the CBD over the years, reads the statement by CHRA.\n\n",
