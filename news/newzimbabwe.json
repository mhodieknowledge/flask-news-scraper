            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nOne of Zimbabwes largest milling companies, Blue Ribbon Foods, has halted operations at its Bulawayo plant due to an acute shortage of grain.\n\nThe shutdown was confirmed on Monday during a tour of the plant with Blue Ribbon Sales Coordinator for Matabeleland North, Nqabutho Mkhize, revealing that the company ran out of grain in April this year.\n\nGrain Millers Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ) Southern Region Chairperson David Moyo painted a bleak picture of dwindling local maize supplies.\n\nAt the beginning, we were able to buy from local farmers and the maize was there.\n\nBut now, it is hard to fill a 30-tonne truck. Sometimes you get three or two 50kg bags a day. It takes a week to fill a truck, said Masuka.\n\nIn response to appeals from millers the government recently lifted the ban on maize imports.\n\nHowever, a new statutory instrument introduced to govern imports has created further complications.\n\nThe regulation imposes a levy on the price difference between imported maize (US$300/tonne from South Africa) and the local producer price (US$200/tonne), payable to the Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA).\n\nMoyo says this measure is making it financially unviable for millers to import the maize they desperately need to keep their plants operational.\n\nThe statutory instrument is unfair and costly. Eventually, the burden will be passed on to the consumer, Moyo said.\n\nWe are simply asking the government to allow millers to import maize freely, without these added levies, as was previously the case.\n\nHe further emphasised that deregulating the maize import framework would allow market forces to determine prices, ultimately lowering the cost of mealie meal for consumers.\n\nThe private sector is here to complement the government. We are partners in ensuring that no Zimbabwean goes hungry in line with the Presidents own promise that no one will be left behind, Moyo said.\n\nThe continued closure of key milling plants like Blue Ribbon in Bulawayo not only threatens food security in urban areas but also risks job losses and rising mealie meal prices at a time when most households are already battling inflation and economic hardship.\n\nMillers are now calling on the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development to urgently review the statutory instrument and allow for flexible, cost-effective maize importation to stabilise the milling industry.\n\n",

You saw the goals that we conceded. Just look at the three goals that we conceded; even social players can defend those goals.\n\nThe truth of the matter is that we are discovering the quality of these players here; that is a fact I cannot run away from, said Sibanda.\n\nCrashing out of COSAFA is a missed chance for Zimbabwe to qualify for the Africa Cup of Nations to be held in Morocco next year.\n\nZimbabwe also missed a shot to compete for one of the 10 slots for African teams that will qualify for the expanded 48-team Under 17 World Cup to be hosted by Qatar next year.\n\nSibanda further said the lack of sufficient preparation culminated in Zimbabwe performing badly.\n\nThe truth of the matter is, in football there are players that are introverts and there are players that are extroverts; those that quickly express themselves and there are players that will take time to express themselves. If you have a longer time to select players you can see both of those players, he said.\n\nAn assignment is on ZIFA and the newly appointed technical director, Dominique Niyonzima, to conjure a plan and craft a junior football policy.\n\n",

The footage clearly shows the accused overseeing the movement of property valued at nearly US$4 million, the court heard.\n\nProsecutors said Chiyani, whose role was to ensure security compliance, failed to provide invoices to justify the movement of the items, while Mhaka allegedly instructed a boilermaker to cut an electric motor and a storage container to make them easier to load.\n\nThe state argued that the pair abused their trusted positions within ZPC.\n\nThis case serves as a clear example of the accountability required of those entrusted with national assets.

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) has applauded the governments decision to reduce and eliminate several repetitive licensing fees, a move it says will significantly improve the ease of doing business.\n\nFinanceMinister Mthuli Ncube last week announced a package of reforms aimed at lowering compliance costs, particularly within the agricultural value chain.\n\nUnder the new measures, the US$500 registration fee for small-scale farmers has been scrapped, while the annual dairy processor registration fee of US$350 has been replaced with a one-off US$50 charge. Feed manufacturing registration fees have been cut from US$250 to US$20, and livestock movement clearance fees have been halved from US$10 to US$5 per herd.\n\nOther changes include a reduction of the livestock genetics import permit from US$100 to US$20, and a cut to the meat export registration fee from US$500 to US$100. The food handler certificate fee has been abolished, while Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) costs have been capped at 0.05 percent, with a ceiling of US$100,000.\n\nCZI described the reforms as one of the most significant in recent years. According to the industry body, a total of 96 regulations affecting livestock farming, dairy production, processing, and stockfeed manufacturing were reviewed. Of these, 34 were eliminated, and 40 percent were reduced by at least half.\n\nFor dairy farming, nine regulations were eliminated and seven more were cut significantly. In livestock farming, 45 percent of regulations were scrapped, immediately lifting a huge burden on producers, CZI said.\n\nThe review found that compliance costs in some areas had been reduced by up to 99 percent. The Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA) accounted for the highest number of eliminated regulations at 10, followed by local authorities with eight and the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) with seven. At least 12 high-cost regulationspreviously charging over US$400 eachwere scrapped, while turnover-based levies were capped to avoid penalising larger firms.\n\nRemoving disproportionate charges was critical. The size of a company does not automatically translate into higher enforcement costs, and the new system finally reflects that reality, added CZI.\n\n",
