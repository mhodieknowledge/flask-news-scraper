The mismanagement by the Dynamos executive led by Bernard Marriot, his relatives, and the so-called NEC has reached a boiling point, said Machovo.\n\nDynamos continue to sink deeper, currently occupying the relegation zone, separated by only two points from Kwekwe United, who sit at the basement of the table.\n\nDeMbare have managed just one win in 13 matches, scoring only two goalsa record that has sparked fury among supporters.\n\nThe struggles have been attributed to poor recruitment and the general welfare of players at the club.\n\nMachovo accused Dynamos leadership of running the club with an amateurish, and an outdated approach.\n\nWe can no longer remain silent. Our key concerns is the tuck shop mentality, outdated approach and sponsorship failure, said Machovo.\n\n",
