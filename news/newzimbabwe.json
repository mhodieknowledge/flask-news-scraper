            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nFor the first time in Zimbabwes history, intersex persons have taken the government to court, demanding legal recognition of their rights and protection from decades of systemic exclusion.\n\nThe High Court application, filed under case number HCH4743/25, seeks a declaratory order compelling the state to officially recognise intersex people as a distinct category under Zimbabwean law.\n\nAmong their demands are the introduction of a third sex marker on birth certificates, IDs, and passports, procedures to amend sex markers on documents, and a ban on non-consensual, non-essential surgeries on intersex minors. They also want full access to rights such as dignity, education, healthcare, and equality under the Constitution.\n\nThe case has seven applicants, including two minors denied education and social services because their documents did not reflect their lived realities. One adult applicant was subjected to irreversible surgery as a child, leaving them with lifelong health complications and mismatched identity papers.\n\nThe minors are being represented by their legal guardians.\n\nThe Health Law and Policy Consortium (HLPC) and the Intersex Community of Zimbabwe (ICoZ) have also joined the case as institutional applicants. Cited as respondents are the Registrar-General, the Ministers of Home Affairs, Health, and Justice, and the Attorney General.\n\nIn his founding affidavit, Tinashe Mundawarara, HLPC board chairperson, argued that failure to issue accurate identity documents violates childrens constitutional rights.\n\nSection 81 (1)(c) specifically guarantees every child the right to a birth certificate, he said. By failing to ensure that intersex children are issued birth certificates that reflect their unique biological reality, the respondents deny them a fundamental right and create barriers to accessing essential services such as healthcare and education.\n\nHLPC programs coordinator Dorcas Chitiyo added: This case seeks to address the systematic legal and administrative failures that have perpetuated exclusion, discrimination and harm against intersex persons in Zimbabwe.\n\nICoZ director Kudakwashe Murisa said intersex people have endured silence and invisibility for too long.\n\nThis case is historic. For the first time, the Zimbabwean legal system is being challenged to recognise the rights of intersex individuals as equal human beings under the Constitution, they said.\n\nMurisa stressed that the matter goes beyond individual struggles.\n\nThis case is not just about one individual. It is about an entire community that has been made invisible for too long. It is about ensuring that no intersex child will endure what so many others have suffered in silence.\n\nAs an intersex person, Murisa described the personal toll of mismatched documents: Being intersex, I have to explain myself each time I want to use my identity documents. This is because they dont match with the sex I was assigned at birth.\n\nThe matter is yet to be heard.\n\n",

All told, the ZDF will get over 700 vehicles, the first ever time that ZDF has received such a consignment within a short-time bracket, Charamba announced on his X account on Monday.\n\nThe timing has raised eyebrows, with many viewing the gesture as a clear coup-proofing strategy.\n\nCharamba defended the move, framing it as a fulfilment of service conditions for senior officers: The vehicles, which are part of the conditions of service for senior army officers, plug a gap in conditions of service for officers, some of whom had gone for a couple of years without a full set of their entitlements.\n\nHowever, he also revealed the allocation is structured as a loan. In public sector parlance, these vehicles are called personal issue service vehicles. What that means is that the vehicle is personal to the haver, who is also allowed to buy the vehicle after a stipulated time.\n\nThe development has already sparked public scrutiny, with critics demanding clarity on the source of funds and whether the purchase was accounted for in the 2025 national budget.\n\nObservers warn Zimbabwe is increasingly resembling a mafia-style economy where political elites distribute vehicles and perks like candy to loyalists and strategic allies in order to cling to power.\n\n",

This means that prices, as measured by the all-items ZWG Consumer Price Index (CPI), decreased by an average of 0.2% between August and September 2025, Zimstat said.\n\nFood and Non-Alcoholic Beverages recorded a month-on-month inflation rate of 0.2% in September, up from 0.1% in August. In contrast, non-food inflation fell to 0.5%, down from 0.6% in the previous month.\n\nYear-on-year, however, inflation remains elevated. The ZWG year-on-year inflation rate for September 2025 was 82.7%, meaning prices increased by an average of 82.7% compared to September 2024, Zimstat added.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has continued to pursue a tight monetary policy to safeguard the ZiG currency introduced in April 2024. This has included maintaining a high policy rate to curb speculative borrowing and anchor both inflation and exchange rate expectations.\n\nMeanwhile, Zimstat reported that US dollar inflation remained steady, with the September 2025 month-on-month rate unchanged at 0%, while year-on-year inflation stood at 13.4%.\n\nOn the poverty benchmarks, the Food Poverty Line (FPL) for one person in September was ZWG 877.03, while the Total Consumption Poverty Line (TCPL) stood at ZWG 1,292.80,the minimum needed per person to cover both food and non-food requirements.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has reported a 4% increase in armed robbery cases between January and August this year, a rise officials partly attribute to the forces acute shortage of vehicles, equipment, and manpower needed to effectively combat crime.\n\nDeputy Police Commissioner for Administration Leny Ncube told the Defence, Security and Home Affairs Parliamentary Portfolio Committee during an oral evidence hearing on Tuesday that while general robbery cases fell by 8% over the same period, armed robberies  the most violent category  remain a growing concern.\n\nOur analysis of crime statistics for the period January to August 2025, compared to the same period in 2024, reveals a different picture. We have recorded an overall 8% decrease in total robbery cases. However, there is a concerning 4% increase in the most violent category,robberies committed using firearms, Ncube said.\n\nHe added that the ZRP was fully alert to the threat and taking action within its means, but warned that the shortage of resources was undermining the polices ability to respond effectively.\n\nWhile government has over the past years availed operational vehicles, we continue to experience shortages as our ageing fleet is susceptible to breakdowns, hampering rapid response to crime scenes. The sad reality is that we are often outpaced by criminals using high-powered vehicles, Ncube said.\n\nOf the ZRPs required 9,320 vehicles, the force currently has 2,830, of which 1,007 are grounded due to breakdowns,leaving only 1,823 operational, roughly 20% of its needs.\n\nThe Deputy Commissioner also highlighted that criminal syndicates were becoming increasingly sophisticated, with some involving former security service members who brought expertise to their operations. These groups, he said, were using cloned vehicles, counter-intelligence tactics, and advanced technologies, leaving the ZRP ill-equipped.\n\nWe lack advanced technology to monitor the movement of sophisticated and transnational criminals. In todays environment, where criminal activity is being propelled by technology, technology-driven policing ceases to be a luxury,it is now essential if we are to remain relevant, Ncube stressed.\n\nTo mitigate the surge in armed robberies, the police are encouraging businesses to invest in functional CCTV systems and alarm technologies.\n\nThe ZRP is steadily advancing its capabilities through the strategic adoption of technology to combat armed robberies. Our focus is on both prevention and investigation, and we are championing the adoption of security technologies within the business community, Ncube said.\n\n",
