            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA top official has highlighted the need for stronger systems to safeguard the remittances and investments of Zimbabweans abroad, emphasizing governments commitment to protecting and supporting the diasporas contributions to national development.\n\nZimbabweans abroad contribute significantly to the national fiscus, accounting for an estimated 10 percent of the countrys domestic product.\n\nThese remittance flows have been pivotal in contributing to the countrys revenue, prompting the Deputy Minister of Youth Empowerment, Development and Vocational Training, Kudakwashe Mupamhanga, to call for the government to introduce incentives for Zimbabweans abroad.\n\nMupamhanga was speaking at the ZAA Diaspora Forum in Harare organised by Destiny Media Group.\n\nAnything that encourages the diaspora to get more and more involved in their country I represent a rural area. I like to be biased towards the rural area where diaspora investment can come and partner with the Government in developing our rural areas. Everyone has a kumusha [home] that they came from. Everyone has roots; those people need the diaspora to play ball. It is not just about sending money for medication but also getting involved in the rural district councils, said Mupamhanga.\n\nThe forum brought together Zimbabweans based abroad and policymakers to explore investment opportunities. It was part of the two-day programme which concludes Saturday with an awards gala at the Manna Resorts.\n\nSpeaking at the same event, the UK Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Peter Vowles, said it was vital for Zimbabweans in the diaspora to plough back their experiences into local communities.\n\nMany Zimbabweans in the diaspora are building lives around the world, including in the UK. Many Zimbabweans in the UK dream or plan to return home, and as a British Ambassador, one of the great privileges is meeting British citizens with Zimbabwean heritage coming home. You are bringing back experiences, ideas, and energy that can shape Zimbabwes future, said Vowles.\n\n",

            "content": "By James Muonwa\n\nCHINHOYI University of Technology (CUT) has achieved gender parity in the number of graduands churned out of the Class of 2025, amid a shift that witnessed more females than males graduating.\n\nDuring the universitys 21st graduation ceremony held on Thursday, a total of 3,130 graduands were capped by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is the Chancellor of all State universities.\n\nOf the graduating Class of 2025, there were 1,573 females and 1,557 males, marking a slight difference of 16.\n\nTraditionally, during previous graduation ceremonies, the number of male graduates surpassed that of females.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the event held at CUT Grounds, womens rights lobbyist, Chioniso Gurupira, said the new trend was a positive sign of strides the country has made in empowering women and the girl-child.\n\nThe one thing that has probably struck some of us in the gender mainstreaming sector is the number of female graduands at this event. The women are slightly more than the men, which is a positive story of CUT having achieved gender parity, said Gurupira.\n\nGender parity refers to a situation where the number of females and males is roughly equal or balanced in a particular context, such as in education, the workforce, or leadership roles.\n\nIt implies equal representation, opportunities, and treatment of both genders.\n\nA female graduand, Jennifer Tinotenda Sanjobo, who graduated with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Crop Science, expressed joy at having successfully completed her degree in a previously male-dominated study area, which will enable her to contribute meaningfully to national development.\n\nI am excited to have graduated with a BSc in Crop Science. We were a few ladies in our cohort and l feel proud to be among the graduands, said Sanjobo.\n\nI am hoping to use my newly acquired education and expertise to help Zimbabwe fight climate change by coming up with seed varieties that can adapt and withstand the rigours of the phenomenon.\n\nIn a small way, I am optimistic my contribution to climate-proofing agriculture will bring about food security and national development, she added.\n\nWhile CUT has managed to bring an equilibrium between the number of graduates based on gender, sadly total number of graduands tumbled this year to 3,130 from the 2024 figure, which stood at 3,545. In 2023, a total of 3,480 graduated from the same university.\n\nAddressing guests, CUT Vice Chancellor, Professor David Simbi lamented the low uptake of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses, which are the varsitys anchor areas of study.\n\nOur understanding as a higher education institution of our role is using research, innovation, science and technology development to drive and develop the industrialisation and modernisation of Zimbabwe to achieve a middle economic status by 2030\n\nHowever, our human capital development remains side lobbed in that there are too few STEM students in our programmes, despite the importance we attach to the related programmes of study, said Simbi.\n\nThis is, however, not peculiar to Zimbabwe, and there are other routes that we can use to meet this deficit that other countries with similar problems have adopted.\n\nTo this end, Your Excellency and Chancellor, CUT will be seriously investigating the introduction of foundation programmes in science, technology and engineering as pre-university basic technology education.\n\nSimbi noted that the approach is a common trend in the United Kingdom, Singapore and Malaysia, among other countries.\n\nThe vice chancellor also lamented the high cost of laboratory equipment, which he, however, said could be dealt with by adopting reverse engineering.\n\nSimbi told graduands that the Heritage-Based Education 5.0 philosophy had prepared them for the future.\n\nHeritage-based education has prepared you for the future. To the private sector, these graduates are ready to take on any challenge for the good of the country. In broader contribution, heritage-based education has gained greater meaning in the nation and beyond, towards industrialisation and modernisation, Simbi said.\n\n",

            "content": "The Guardian\n\nThe Rams linebacker spent the early part of his life in Zimbabwe. But he has kept his childhood memories alive as his football career has grown.\n\nFor Nate Landman, surprise has become routine. TheLos Angeles Ramslinebacker has lost count of the raised eyebrows, smirks, and awkward pauses when people learn where his story begins.\n\nThey dont believe me at first, Landman said. Ill show them Im covered in African tattoos, and some will say Im still lying until they look it up or someone will vouch for me.\n\nLandman isnt exaggerating  a white guy with a Californian accent isnt most peoples picture of what one of the NFLs few African players would look like. But born in Harare, Zimbabwes capital, in 1998, Landmans roots are intertwined with the countrys sporting tradition. His South African father, Shaun, was in Zimbabwe at the time playing international rugby. When an engineering consulting firm offered Shaun a position in California, the family seized the opportunity. When Nate was three, the Landmans had moved to Danville, California, bringing with them not just their belongings, but also a rich cultural identity.\n\nLandman is the only active NFL player with Zimbabwe roots. Stansly Maponga, also born in Zimbabwe, played from 2013 until 2015. The NFL doesnt have the influx of international players like the NBA. Foreign-born players comprise only 3% to 4% of the leagues numbers  Canada, Germany and Nigeria that have produced the most. The NFL is trying to change that, and created the International Player Pathway program as a way to increase the number of players born outside the United States.\n\nAs for Landman, as the years passed Harare became more of a childhood blur than a lived memory. But his family kept Zimbabwe alive in their home, particularly when it came to food.\n\nWe brought a lot of the Zimbabwean culture into our home, Landman said. Our home is still decorated as if we were still in Zimbabwe.\n\nAs his three siblings and parents took pride in their South African and Zimbabwean ties, Landman grew up between worlds: California suburbia on the outside, African traditions on the inside.\n\nAthleticism was never far from the conversation in the Landman household. Shaun had played at the University of Cape Town before representing Zimbabwe in rugby. Nates mother, too, was a competitive athlete.\n\nInspired by that legacy, Landman threw himself into sports. In high school, he excelled in rugby and baseball. But it was football that became his calling.\n\nAt the University of Colorado, Landmans relentless energy quickly made him a defensive cornerstone. Across five seasons, he developed a reputation as one of the better linebackers in the Pac-12 Conference. He earned first-team All-Pac-12 honors in 2019 and 2020 and added a second-team selection in 2021. His style of play  fast, physical, fearless  mirrored the competitive fire passed down from his father.\n\nBut the NFL is rarely a straight line.\n\nDespite his production at Colorado, Landmans name wasnt called during the 2022 NFL draft. Instead, he signed with the Atlanta Falcons as an undrafted free agent. He worked his way on to the roster, appearing in seven games as a special-teamer before being cut and placed on the practice squad later that season.\n\nIts tough being undrafted, Landman said. Its not an easy road. Its a road Im proud of because its made me the player I am today. I took advantage of the opportunities  Its a huge part of my story.\n\nPerseverance paid off the following season. Landman not only made the Falcons roster but started 14 of 16 games. He collected 110 tackles, seven tackles for loss, and owned the second-best run-stop rate in the NFL among qualified linebackers (12.6%).\n\nFor Landman, the achievement was about more than numbers. It was about validation.\n\nIt was about setting a goal, reaching it, and then setting another goal, he said. Becoming a starter in this league is something Im super proud of. Its something everyones striving to do. Its especially not easy for undrafted guys.\n\nIt was easy for Landman to sign a one-year contract this offseason with the Rams. The team was in need of his leadership at inside linebacker, and it helped that Landman had a strong relationship with Rams assistant defensive coach Jimmy Lake, with whom hed previously worked with in Atlanta under the same system.\n\nThese guys around me have allowed me to take a step up in my game, Landman said. Everyone [on defense] elevates each other, and thats the biggest thing that Ive noticed here.\n\nRams inside linebackers coach Greg Williams has noticed a few different intangibles that Landman has brought to the team.\n\nHe brings us something we havent had in a while, which is his communication and energy, said Williams, following the Rams preseason victory over the Cleveland Browns last Saturday. He understands the whole game from a run-game and a pass-game perspective. So, the fact that he communicates with the entire defense, hes the glue that brings it all together, which gives guys the freedom to play, and everybody loves it.\n\nWhether its the culture woven into his home life, the continent of Africa tattooed on the right side of his chest, or the determination that has carried him from an overlooked rookie to a starter in the NFL, Landman, who last visited his home country two years ago, continues to carry Zimbabwe with him onto the field.\n\nHard work may have built his career, but identity grounds it.\n\nHaving the support of my relatives who still live over there, he said, wearing tattoos, and having the Zimbabwe flag on the back of my helmet are all very important to me.\n\n",
