international security dilemmas.Muchinguri-Kashiri made the remarks on Friday at a reception held by the Chinese embassy in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, ahead of the 76th anniversary of the founding of the Peoples Republic of China, which falls on Oct. 1.We wish to reaffirm our governments support for the recently announced Global Governance Initiative and all the other initiatives spearheaded by China, she said.Muchinguri-Kashiri said relations between Zimbabwe and China have soared, which is evidenced by the elevation of ties to an all-weather community with a shared future

coordination between China and Africa as well as the Global South, she said.Over the years, the level of economic cooperation between our two countries has soared to greater heights as evidenced by
