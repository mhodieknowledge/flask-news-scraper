            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nNotorious theft suspect Romeo Kurai Pemba (39), once convicted of theft in 2015,has once again found himself in court, this time accused of breaking into multiple government offices, including those under the Office of the President and Cabinet, and stealing property worth over US$23,000.\n\nPemba was arrested on October 2, 2025, after an extensive investigation by the CID Stores and Business Unitin Harare. According to police, he was captured on CCTVcommitting the crimes and later led detectives to the recovery of part of the stolen propertyvalued at US$1,400.\n\nHe appeared before Harare magistrate Tapiwa Kuhudzai, who remanded him in custody after he pleaded to all nine counts of unlawful entry. His plea recording is expected to continue on Tuesday before sentencing.\n\nThe State alleges that between June and September 2025, Pemba went on a burglary spree targeting high-security government officeslocated in Mukwati and Kaguvi Buildings, including those belonging to the Office of the President and Cabinet, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Womens Affairs, Gender and Wellness, and ZimStat.\n\nPemba allegedly used unknown tools to force open office doors and stole laptops, CPUs, monitors, and other electronic equipment. Several items have since been positively identifiedby the affected departments.\n\nThe accused person was captured on CCTV committing the crime and the footage is held as an exhibit, reads part of the police remand request. He led to the recovery of part of the stolen property and indicated how he committed the crime. Fingerprints uplifted at the scene matched those of the accused.\n\nPolice strongly opposed bail, citing Pembas previous conviction and high flight risk. Detective Assistant Inspector Christopher Lloyd Tarenyikastated that Pemba has no fixed addressand could easily abscond or interfere with witnesses.\n\nThe accused person has known previous convictions under CRB HREP 10833/15, Tarenyika said. He is facing a serious offence which, if convicted, attracts a lengthy custodial sentence. There is overwhelming evidence linking him to the crime, and if granted bail, he may abscond or interfere with witnesses.\n\nThe charges fall under Section 131(1)(a)as read with Section 131(2)(e)of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act [Chapter 9:23], which covers aggravated unlawful entry.\n\nPembas latest arrest adds to his record of theft-related offences. Police say he was convicted in 2016following similar allegations. Investigations into related cases are ongoing, with at least 15 witnessesexpected to testify. The total value of stolen property is pegged at US$23,020, with only a fraction recovered so far.\n\nHe remains in custody pending his next court appearance.\n\n",

Built using locally available materials, the system is both environmentally friendly and economically accessible, offering a scalable solution to Zimbabwes energy and climate resilience challenges.\n\nThis initiative represents a practical example of climate innovation in Zimbabwe  a solution that not only reduces greenhouse gas emissions but also empowers communities through local manufacturing and skills development, saidDr. Ayodele Odusola, UNDP Resident Representative. By investing in sustainable technologies like this, we are helping to ensure that no one is left behind in the transition to a greener, more resilient future.\n\nKey Highlights of the Event:\n\nTheEvaporative Cooling System Inception Meeting, held at UNDPs Harare offices, marked a significant milestone in Zimbabwes transition toward climate-resilient and energy-efficient technologies. The event brought together key stakeholders from government, academia, the private sector, and development partners to discuss the systems design, applications, and roadmap for national deployment.\n\nA highlight of the event was theformal introduction of the prototypefrom Phokeng Global Health and Environmental Solutions to the Scientific and Industrial Research and Development Centre (SIRDC), symbolizing the transition from design to institutional adoption and field testing. The technology will undergo pilot testing and performance monitoring in selected communities, with results informing wider national rollout.\n\nThe system directly supports the National Climate Change Policy (2017), the Energy Efficiency Policy (2024), and Zimbabwes Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC 3.0). It also contributes to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 7, 9, and 13, advancing access to clean energy, innovation, and climate action.\n\n",

Zimplow also disposed of outdated equipment to free up capital for reinvestment. Proceeds from the sale of its Dagenham Road property have been channelled toward the establishment of a new mining and logistics hub in Msasa.\n\nThe groups strategic shift toward the mining sector is part of efforts to cushion itself from the volatility of the agriculture industry. However, a poor weather outlook,with forecasts predicting below-average rainfall,is expected to weigh heavily on its agriculture-focused subsidiaries, Farmec and Mealie Brand, which depend on rain-fed farming. This could dampen sales and create financial pressure, compounded by potential inventory build-ups from trade loans that may increase storage costs and force price cuts.\n\nDespite these headwinds, Zimplows mining-related operations remain robust. Subsidiaries such as Scanlink and Tractive Power Solutions continue to perform well, buoyed by sustained demand for heavy equipment in Zimbabwes mining sector. Similarly, Powermec is benefiting from increased demand for solar-powered generators amid persistent power shortages caused by drought conditions.\n\nThe company is also exploring drought-adaptive innovations, including modular irrigation kits and scalable solar power solutions, to diversify its revenue streams.\n\nHowever, smuggling continues to undermine operations at Trentyre and CT Bolts, with the influx of grey market imports eroding revenues.\n\nZimplows diversification strategy, supported by cost discipline and its pivot toward mining and renewable energy solutions, positions the group for potential recovery in the second half of 2025,provided it successfully navigates the prevailing economic and regulatory challenges.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has dealt a major blow to troubled mining giant RioZim Limited, ruling that the company cannot sell off its assets while under corporate rescue proceedings  a legal process meant to save firms from total collapse.\n\nJustice Regis Dembure has dismissed RioZims application to appeal an earlier order stopping it from disposing of mines and other key assets, saying the company had no legal leg to stand on.\n\nThe mere filing of the application with the Registrar of the High Court, even before the merits of the application are considered, has the effect of commencing corporate rescue proceedings, Dembure said, citing earlier rulings in the Metallon Gold case.\n\nIn simple terms, once a company files for corporate rescue, its hands are tied: it cannot sell assets, restructure freely, or dodge creditors without court oversight.\n\nRioZims lawyer, Advocate Thabani Mpofu, had argued the companys board should still be allowed to make operational decisions while waiting for a rescue practitioner to be appointed.\n\nThis board is alive; the provisions of section 127 should not prevent it from making necessary operational decisions to avoid financial distress, he argued.\n\nBut the Zimbabwe Diamond & Allied Minerals Workers Union, which brought the case, hit back.\n\nThe company cannot just choose which legal provisions apply to its convenience during its financial turmoil, said lawyer T.L. Mapuranga. The notion that the board can operate unrestricted is a gross misinterpretation of the law.\n\nJustice Dembure agreed with the union, ruling that RioZims bid was without merit and ordering the company to pay legal costs.\n\nThe decision comes as RioZim faces mounting pressure from workers it owes over US$37 million in unpaid wages and benefits. More than 200 employees recently won an arbitration award, but their victory has also been thrown into limbo.\n\nIn another recent judgment, Justice Catherine Bachi Mzawazi struck the case off the roll after RioZims lawyers argued the award could not be enforced because the company is under corporate rescue.\n\nThe law is indeed an ass, so they say, Justice Mzawazi remarked. The respondent tactfully sought refuge from the law at the detriment of the employees rights yet the law is the law nonetheless.\n\nShe said corporate rescue temporarily freezes all lawsuits until the process is completed  usually within three months.\n\nCorporate rescue is a lifeline thrown to enable a company in financial distress to be rehabilitated in order to make a financial turnaround so as to meet its obligations, she explained.\n\n",

Since then, 67,160 have been killed by Israeli military operations in Gaza, including 18,000 children, according to the territorys Hamas-run health ministry.\n\nIn a statement commemorating the 7 October anniversary, United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said Trumps plan presents an opportunity that must be seized to bring this tragic conflict to an end.\n\nUK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer reiterated his support for the plan in his statement commemorating the anniversary, saying: We welcome the US initiative towards peace in the Middle East, and this government will do everything in our power to bring about the day where every child of Israel can live peacefully, alongside their Palestinian neighbours, in safety and security.\n\nThese discussions are expected to be among the most consequential since the start of the war and could determine whether a path toward ending the conflict is finally within reach.\n\nUS special envoy Steve Witkoff, Trumps son-in-law Jared Kushner and Qatari foreign minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani are among those attending.\n\nTrump, writing on social media, has urged everyone involved in efforts to end the Gaza war to move fast and says he has been told the first phase of the peace plan  which includes the hostage release  should be completed this week.\n\nOn Monday, he told reporters at the White House that Hamas has been agreeing to things that are very important.\n\nI really think were going to have a deal, he added.\n\nA Palestinian official close to the negotiations told the Reuters news agency that the first session ended late Monday evening, and more talks were due to take place on Tuesday.\n\nState-affiliated Al-Qahera News also said talks would continue on Tuesday  and that the first day had ended amid a positive atmosphere.\n\nThe 20-point plan, which has been agreed upon by Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, proposes an immediate end to fighting and the release of 48 hostages, only 20 of whom are thought to be alive, in exchange for hundreds of detained Gazans.\n\nThe plan stipulates that once both sides agree to the proposal full aid will be immediately sent into the Gaza Strip.\n\nIt also states that Hamas would have no role in governing Gaza, and it leaves the door open for an eventual Palestinian state.\n\nHowever, after the plan was announced publicly a week ago, Netanyahu reinstated his longstanding opposition to a Palestinian state, saying in a video statement: Its not written in the agreement. We said we would strongly oppose a Palestinian state.\n\nOn Friday,Hamas responded to the proposalin a statement, in which the groupagreed to release all Israeli prisoners, both living and dead, according to the exchange formula contained in Trumps proposal  if the proper conditions for the exchanges are met.\n\nIt did not specifically mention or accept Trumps 20-point plan but said it renews its agreement to hand over the administration of the Gaza Strip to a Palestinian body of independents (technocrats), based on Palestinian national consensus and Arab and Islamic support.\n\nThe statement made no mention of the demands that Hamas agree to its disarmament and to playing no further role in the governance of Gaza.\n\nIt added that the part of the proposals dealing with the future of Gaza and the rights of Palestinian people was still being discussed within a national framework, of which it said Hamas will be a part.\n\nMany Palestinians described Hamas response to the peace plan as unexpected, after days of indications that the group was preparing to reject or at least heavily condition its acceptance of Trumps peace plan proposal.\n\nInstead, Hamas refrained from including its traditional red lines in the official statement, a move many interpret as a sign of external pressure.\n\nEuropean and Middle Eastern leaders have welcomed the proposal. The Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, has called the US presidents efforts sincere and determined.\n\nIran  which has been one of Hamass main sponsors for many years  has also now signalled its support for Trumps Gaza peace plan.\n\nIsraeli bombardment continued in several parts of the Gaza Strip on Monday ahead of the talks beginning.\n\nIsrael is carrying out an offensive in the city, which it has said is aimed at securing the release of the remaining hostages.\n\nMahmoud Basal, spokesman for Gazas Hamas-run civil defence, told the BBC that no aid trucks have been allowed into Gaza City since the offensive began four weeks ago.\n\nThere are still bodies we cannot retrieve from areas under Israeli control, he said.\n\nHundreds of thousands of Gaza City residents have been forced to flee after the Israeli military ordered evacuations to a designated humanitarian area in the south, but hundreds of thousands more are believed to have remained.\n\nIsraels defence minister has warned that those who stay during the offensive would be terrorists and supporters of terror.\n\nIn the last 24 hours, 21 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza and a further 96 injured, the Hamas-run health ministry said in its latest update.\n\nInternational journalists have been banned by Israel from entering the Gaza Strip independently since the start of the war, making verifying claims from both sides difficult.\n\n",

Most of the purveyors of this succession issue are known not to be members of Zanu PF; they are known not to be within the structures of Zanu PF.\n\nAs Zanu PF, we will not allow a conversation to be imported into the party. We are going to a conference to check on the mandate which we received from the people in 2023.\n\nAlthough party slogans declaring that Mnangagwa will be in power up until 2030 appear to have been silenced, at provincial, district or cell meetings, they continue being chanted, even in the presence of party bigwigs such as Kazembe Kazembe and Owen Ncube in the Midlands Province.\n\nRecent Politburo meetings have been nothing short of explosive, with Chiwenga standing up to Mnangagwa and bringing dossiers to nail his allies and fear abounds that their tussle could result in another coup.\n\nChiwenga, then Commander of Zimbabwes military, led the 2017 coup that installed Mnangagwa as state leader. Although his influence in the army might have been diluted by his decision to join politics, there is fear that he has a lot of sympathisers within its ranks.\n\nMnangagwa has most of Zimbabwes cash-rich individuals, all of whom would be ready to defend his stay to protect their interests.\n\nAdded Marapira: The relationship between the President and his two Vice Presidents is friendly.\n\nAll this talk of animosity, hatred and fighting is a narrow agenda by other parties hoping to bring alarm and despondency within our rank and file.\n\n",
