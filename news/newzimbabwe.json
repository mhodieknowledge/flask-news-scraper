            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nAT just 40 years of age, Rinos Mautsa has emerged as a shrewd businessman, overseeing multi-million-dollar enterprises within and outside the country.\n\nHaving shown early shoots of entrepreneurship at a young age, Mautsa has established several business ventures, such as the Contact Experience Association of Zimbabwe (CXAZ), formerly CCAZ, and PICCO Construction, among others.\n\nHis humble and calm demeanour belies the success and scale that his businesses have achieved over the years in Zimbabwes challenging economic environment.\n\nNewZimbabwe.com(NZ)caught up with Mautsa(RM), who described his journey and how his businesses have managed to stay afloat despite turbulence.\n\nNZ:Can you walk us through your professional background?\n\nRM: I have always been an entrepreneur at heart, inspired by my mother, whom I assisted in selling farm produce at a young age. While in college, I launched a movie business through a deal with my university, which ignited my passion for entrepreneurship.\n\nDuring my industrial work experience, I started a condiments buying and selling business that eventually grew to the point of exporting to Zambia. After college, I briefly worked at Telecel, TelOne, and Zuva Petroleum in various managerial roles.\n\nThe leaders at TelOne and Zuva greatly influenced my development as a manager and leader, and I am grateful for their mentorship. My wife, who is also my business partner, has played a significant role in my journey. I am a firm believer in God, and I recognise that I wouldnt be where I am today without His mercy.\n\nQN:Walk us through how you launched your businesses and what inspired the journey.\n\nI started my first business while in college by seizing a unique opportunity to run a movie venture. This experience taught me the importance of innovation and calculated risks. On industrial attachment at Dairibord, I started buying and selling condiments from work and exporting to Zambia.\n\nMy condiments business later flourished, allowing me to reinvest and explore further opportunities in education and technology, which ultimately led me to energy and the construction and real estate sectors, where I recognised significant potential to do much more across Africa.\n\nQN: What has managed to sustain your firms in this difficult economic environment?\n\nOur resilience is rooted in our commitment to quality and innovation. We embrace learning and quickly adapt to change. By identifying the critical need for housing and infrastructure in Zimbabwe, we have focused on developing clusters and high-rise flats that maximise space and align with market demands. This strategic focus has enabled us to thrive even in challenging economic conditions.\n\nQN: You have expanded outside of the country. How has that experience been, and how are the firms performing abroad?\n\nExpanding beyond Zimbabwe has been a rewarding experience, allowing us to tap into new markets and diversify our portfolio. Our firms abroad are performing well as we adapt our strategies to local needs while maintaining the high standards weve established. The Chartered Institute of Customer Management is now operating in 13 countries across Africa.\n\nQN: Your portfolio spans construction (Picco), education, energy, and more. How do you identify opportunities across such diverse sectors, and whats your strategy for scaling them?\n\nIdentifying opportunities across diverse sectors requires a keen understanding of market dynamics and trends. My previous work experience informs many of my ventures.\n\nI focus on thorough research and analysis to pinpoint market gaps. My strategy for scaling involves building strong partnerships, nurturing relationships, leveraging technology, and maintaining a customer-centric approach to meet the evolving needs of our clients.\n\n",

I think once you show people respect, they know you were raised well. Where you come from becomes a secondary issue.\n\nDespite cultural similarities, Awa Khiwe revealed that her upbringing in a Zimbabwean village in Nkayi prepared her for life in KwaNongoma.\n\nBeing raised in the village helped me shape my cultural identity. The KwaNongoma lifestyle is similar to that of Nkayi its not a huge adjustment.\n\nAwa Khiwe, renowned for championing Ndebele pride on global stages, has opened up about embracing a more traditional role in her personal life.\n\nNow living in a new home, the outspoken rapper revealed that while many know her as a fierce and fearless queen, she proudly takes on the role of being a loved,spoiled and submissive wife to her Zulu husband.\n\nSpeaking candidly, she said she respects both Zulu and Ndebele cultures, describing the union as a beautiful exchange rather than a clash.\n\nAwa said her open-mindedness allows her to find strength in unity and mutual respect, rather than division, even in deeply rooted cultural differences.\n\nVeteran actor Ernest Ndlovu joined Awa Khiwe in KwaNongoma to celebrate her wedding day. Image: Pixel Visuals\n\nWhile fans speculated that new music inspired by the wedding might be on the way, Awa was quick to set the record straight:\n\nI have new music, but it has nothing to do with the wedding, she said. I juggle music and family, Im old enough to handle the situation.\n\nHer husband, a Qwabe man involved in the construction industry, has been in her life for years. The two met through a mutual friend, Macingwana, and nurtured their relationship quietly before tying the knot in a ceremony that honoured both families.\n\nOn social media, she called it the best day of my life and added in a heartfelt tribute:\n\nThank you for keeping your promise, my love. I promise to love, honour, respect and protect you, till death do us part.\n\n",

We can not have a society that aspires to wear second-hand clothes. It is a serious oxymoron; we have cotton we can not make new clothes. So we wait for the cotton to be exported and clothes to be manufactured, and they are worn before we wear them.\n\nOn the other hand, we have some in our midst wearing second-hand clothes. We must assist each other as a society. We need to deal with it in a sensitive manner, but at the same time, we can not sustain a city based on second-hand clothes.\n\nDespite their importation ban by the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA), second-hand clothes have provided relief for cash-strapped individuals due to their affordability.\n\nThe ban on the importation of second-hand clothes was implemented by ZIMRA in 2015, but due to porous borders, they continue to flood the streets, being sold at cheaper prices.\n\nIn Harare, second-hand clothes are also sold at night, a practice the government is also banning.\n\nThe Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) has since condemned the move as autocratic, particularly in an economy reliant on the informal sector.\n\nThe Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) notes with deep concern the position taken by the Ministry of Local Government on banning the selling of second-hand clothing and street vending\n\nThis intervention by the Ministry of Local Government is a clear reflection of the failure of the implementation of devolution within the local authority, the decision was made from an autocratic position\n\nThe City of Harare has to run the operations within the City in accordance with Section 264 of the Constitution, the procedure should be done in accordance with the Constitution.\n\nThe informal sector has for years been complementing the formal sector as there has been an emergence of formal businesses operating 24/7 in the CBD over the years, reads the statement by CHRA.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) Thursday upheld the tight Monetary Policy stance as a strategy to conserve the local currency.\n\nPresenting the Mid-Term Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), premised under the theme Walking The Talk And Staying The Course, the central bank governor, Dr John Mushayavanhu, once again stated that the bank was receiving widespread acclaim for its sustained exchange rate stability.\n\nThe RBZ projected inflation to end the year at around 30%, giving a positive real interest rate of 5% and maintained the Bank Policy rate at 35% despite sustained outcry from industry on the need to ease the cost of borrowing.\n\nThe high policy rate has choked productivity in the recent past by worsening the cost of capital to fund critical industry needs. However, on its part, the RBZ believes that such rates are necessary to curb speculative borrowing.\n\nOn bank charges, the MPS implored banks to adhere to the measures announced in the February 2025 Monetary Policy Statement to exempt from bank charges all accounts that maintain a balance below US$100 or its equivalent in ZiG.\n\nIn addition, Point of Sale (POS) transactions for amounts less than US$5 or its equivalent in ZiG were also exempted from transaction charges for both banking institutions and Payment System Providers (PSPs).\n\nWhile a noble step, the move falls far short of addressing the thorn in flesh for the transacting public who are ordinarily forced to part ways with US$3,00 per every US$100 withdrawn from banks, a position which increases the cost of doing business, especially for corporates who withdraw large volumes of money.\n\nThe current statutory reserve requirements are set between 15% and 30% depending on the nature of the deposits. Banking institutions can, therefore, easily reduce the effective statutory reserve requirements towards 15% by attracting more long-term deposits.\n\nThe statutory reserve ratios, therefore, remain unchanged and will be reviewed when appropriate and consistent with the monetary policy thrust, reads the MPS in part.\n\nThis is despite complaints from the banking sector alleging that high statutory reserves are mopping up excess resources necessary to support productive lending.\n\nThe MPS maintained the export surrender thresholds at 30% but did not address the pertinent concerns raised by exporters who allege they have not been paid the ZWG portion for a prolonged period of time in what experts believe to be one of the strategies to protect the local unit.\n\nMarket watchers suspect that the move to withhold the export surrender thresholds for fear of weakening ZWG is an indication of a currency facing the crisis of fragility.\n\nDespite having triggered fears across the markets on impending monocurrency by 2030, Dr Mushayavanhus MPS did not disclose the practical roadmap to his course of action, instead opting to give assurances of a workable process.\n\nThe de-dollarisation roadmap will be crystallised in the National Development Strategy II and the Reserve Bank, which is chairing the NDS2 Thematic Working Group on Macroeconomic Stability and Financial Deepening (MESFIND) is currently seized with consultations on the issue.\n\nThe roadmap will undoubtedly encapsulate the need to maintain the current stability, preserve the foreign currency accounts and the value of the existing USD-denominated contracts. Consideration will always be made to ensure that there is business continuity and certainty, the MPS added.\n\n",
