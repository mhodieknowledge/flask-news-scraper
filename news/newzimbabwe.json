Since 2021 to date, only four of the seven vehicles have been delivered, leaving three outstanding, Guvamatanga said.\n\nHe told PAC the company had made an undertaking to deliver the outstanding vehicles by the 2nd of July 2025.\n\nThe ministry has also returned to pass a request for the outcome of the debatement hearing to enable the initiation of federal protection against the supplier if they fail to deliver in July.\n\nAlso, the ministry has ensured that no prepayments are made to suppliers of vehicles before delivery.\n\nPayments are only made for vehicles that are already delivered.\n\nIn the event that the supplier is set to receive an advance payment, the ministry will ensure that a bank guarantee equivalent to the requested payment value is provided by a registered commercial bank, said the Finance secretary.\n\n",

However, Dstv did not air the episode in question; it was only aired on the Podcast and Chill channel on YouTube.\n\nDstvs digital distribution partner, Leading Edge Growth, confirmed toTimeslivethat Dstv has removed the popular podcast.\n\nLeading Edge Growth CEO Lufuno Maliavusa gave the confirmation that the show has been pulled.\n\nCiting To keep our content slate dynamic and engaging, we will continue to make adjustments to our roster. Notably, season one ofPodcast and Chilland season one ofAwkward Datesare nearing their final episodes in the coming weeks, making way for fresh and exciting content to take their place in these time slots.\n\nThis follows after MultiChoice refused to confirm the news of the shows cancellation. The Group only said it licensed a slate of podcasts from Leading Edge Growth, which was responsible for curating the podcast slate, taking into account audience dynamics and content demand.\n\nHowever, MacG is reportedlyunmoved by the news, as he is pursuing other endeavours.\n\nThe episode that spoke about Dlaminireceived attention from the Deputy Ministerof Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, Mmapaseka Steve Letsike.\n\nShe said MacGs comments were nauseating in their vulgarity and must be regarded as an unconstitutional violation of Dlaminis rights to freedom and security of the person, equality, and human dignity as enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.\n\nLetsike wanted MacG to be referred to the Parliaments Portfolio Committee, however,this was declined.\n\nI think the majority of members are not in favour of us proceeding as the honorable minister, deputy minister had requested us to do, the committees chairperson Liezl van der Merwe said.\n\nShe pointed out that Dlamini had not approached Parliament nor laid a criminal case.\n\nI think all of you have touched on this point that if we do decide it is our mandate to proceed with hearing one case of cyber-bullying, it would mean that this portfolio committee would have to extend that to every other person because they cannot be selective in choosing one case.\n\nMacG has since apologisedin one his episodes, saying he never intended to offend anyone.\n\nI want to apologise, first and foremost, to all the female chillers, and women in general in SA, I might have offended with that comment. That was not the intention. We never say things to offend people, he said.\n\nI want to extend an invite to Minnie Dlamini to the show. You are more than welcome to come.\n\nThis thing started on the podcastlets end it on the podcast. She said some things, I said some things. Lets squash it once and for all.\n\nDlamini saidshe was hurt and shocked by the commentsmade about her body and personal life on the podcast.\n\nOver the past few weeks, I have watched in disbelief and deep pain as my name, body, and dignity were dragged through the mud of public discourse, she said.\n\nShe described the remarks made by MacG as vile, humiliating, and inexcusable.\n\nDlamini said she is taking legal action to stand up for herself and the dignity of women.\n\n",

President Emmanuel Macron has dismissed speculations that the worlds cameras may have been witness to a domestic squabble, saying the two were simply horsing around.\n\nFrench media on Monday tried to decipher the interaction that cameras spotted through the just-opened door of the plane as the couple disembarked in Hanoi Sunday for the start of a tour of Southeast Asia. The headline of a story on the website of the daily Le Parisien newspaper asked: Slap or squabble? The images ofEmmanuelandBrigitte Macrondisembarking in Vietnam trigger a lot of comment.\n\nTo display this content from X (Twitter), you must enable advertisement tracking and audience measurement.\n\nMacron later told reporters that the couple  married since 2007 after meeting at the high school where he was a student and she was a teacher  were simply joking around.\n\nWe are horsing around and, really, joking with my wife, he said, adding that the incident was being overblown: It becomes a sort of geo-planetary catastrophe.\n\nHe added that other videos had been misinterpreted, like ones purportedly showing him sharing abag of cocaineor confronting the Turkish president. None of these are true, he said, and everyone needs to calm down.\n\nHis office earlier offered a similar explanation.\n\nIt was a moment where the president and his wife were decompressing one last time before the start of the trip by horsing around. Its a moment of complicity. It was all that was needed to give ammunition to the conspiracy theorists, his office said.\n\nThe video showed a uniformed man pulling open the plane door and revealing the president standing inside, dressed in a suit and talking to someone who was not visible.\n\nTwo arms  in red sleeves  reached out and pushed Macron away, with one hand covering his mouth and part of his nose while the other was on his jawbone. The French leader recoiled, turning his head away. Then, apparently realising that he was on camera, he broke into a smile and gave a little wave.\n\nIn subsequent images, Macron and his wife, wearing a red jacket, appeared at the top of the stairs. He offered an arm but she did not take it. They walked down the carpeted stairs side by side.\n\nBrigitte Macron was Brigitte Auzire, a married mother of three children, when they met at his high school. A teacher, she supervised the drama club where Emmanuel Macron, a literature lover, was a member.\n\nHe moved to Paris for his last year of high school, but promised to marry Brigitte. She later moved to the French capital to join him and divorced before they finally married.\n\n",

Conservationist Bernadette Mupinda and her team, along with volunteers, regularly uproot these plants to protect the areasbiodiversity. With over 100 indigenous plant species within the park as well as 200 bird species, their decline could harm this heritage site and its valuable ecosystem.\n\nFor volunteer student Zothile Zulu, community involvement is key to theconservationeffort  and she believes that tangible results encourage participation. The conservancy tracks plant populations using smartphone apps, and their work has led to a 70% reduction in invasive species.\n\nBut Zimbabwes urban green spaces also face broader threats, includingdeforestationand urban expansion. Each year, over 200,000 hectares (nearly 500,000 acres) of forest are cleared, often on wetlands, leading towater shortagesand increased wildfire risks.\n\nThe Hillside Dams Conservancy is also facing financial struggles. Its a popular spot with locals, but visitor fees cover only a portion of conservation costs, forcing the organization to seek external funding. Conservationists hope the area can serve as a model for other parks. With continued support, they aim to safeguard this landmark area and its biodiversity for the sake of future generations.\n\nThis article was originally publishedhere.\n\n",
