            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Labour Court has dismissed an appeal by Watershed College Trust against an arbitral award in favour of a former probationary teacher, ruling that the institution clearly aprobated and reprobated its contractual obligations and acted unlawfully by issuing notice of termination after the expiration of the probation period.\n\nIn a judgment delivered by Justice Samuel Kudya, the court found that while the arbitrator erred in concluding that the teacher, Jenipha Madziva, had become a permanent employee, the substantive award of damages for unfair dismissal remained valid.\n\nWatershed College Trust had challenged the arbitrators ruling on five grounds, including the claim that Madziva was erroneously classified as a permanent employee and that damages were improperly awarded in US dollars. However, Justice Kudya found that only one of the grounds had merit and upheld the rest of the arbitrators findings.\n\nThe employer clearly aprobated and reprobated by writing in the probation contract that it did not intend to extend it, yet it was doing exactly that which it said it did not intend to do, the judge ruled.\n\nThe dispute arose when the school employed Madziva on a fixed-term probation contract, which was due to expire on 31 March 2023.\n\nOn that very day, the school issued a notice stating it would not be extending her contract.\n\nThe arbitrator ruled that this amounted to unlawful termination and awarded damages, prompting the appeal.\n\nKudya criticised the colleges handling of the matter, stating, Had the employer indeed intended to give notice for the termination of the probation contract, it should have done so before its expiration.  It was not remiss for the arbitrator to conclude that once parties were in the April to December phase of the contract, they were now operating in the main contract.\n\nHe added that the colleges attempt to treat the contract as terminated while simultaneously letting it roll into the next phase of employment cannot pass the unreasonableness test laid out in Hama v NRZ.\n\nOn the matter of prejudice, the court noted that unfair dismissal need not be measured by harm suffered.\n\nPrejudice is indeed not a prerequisite to find unlawful termination, Kudya said, affirming the arbitrators position that the dismissal was inherently unfair.\n\nAddressing the employers objection to the damages awarded in US dollars, the court reaffirmed Zimbabwes multi-currency framework.\n\nThere was nothing remiss by making the order which the arbitrator made.  If the employer wants to pay what was ordered using the rate of the local currency at the date of payment, nothing stops it from doing so.\n\nThe judge further dismissed the employers contention that the arbitrator had wrongly quantified the damages.\n\nIt was unnecessary to try to find out what was due when it was apparent on the contract. The res ipsa loquitur principle applies.\n\nThe judge upheld the appeal relating to the employees classification as permanent.\n\nHe ruled that the arbitral award stands, but with the correction that Madziva was not a permanent employee.\n\nWatershed College Trust was ordered to pay costs on the ordinary scale.\n\n",

            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nZimbabweand theUKare rekindling diplomatic ties after almost three decades of tension, driven by a global surge in demand for critical minerals thats led the former colonial power to pursue $1 billion in deals with the resource-rich nation.\n\nIn June, the UK dispatched Minister for Africa Lord Ray Collins of Highbury to meet Zimbabwean PresidentEmmerson Mnangagwaand other senior leaders. The trip marked a rare encounter between the two nations officials after years of deteriorating relations, especially under former PresidentRobert Mugabe a vocal critic of Britains 90-year colonial rule of the southern African nation.\n\nCollins described his visit as a mission for economic growth that would lead to a win-win situation for both countries. The British Embassy in Harare echoed that sentiment in the past week, citing a $1 billion pipeline of prospective deals across key sectors such as agriculture, finance, telecommunications, renewable energy and critical minerals that it wants to close.\n\nIt identified the 30-megawatt Vungu solar energy investment as a beacon project and said others will follow soon.\n\nThe UK is working hard to increase trade and investment for mutual benefit, a spokesperson said in an emailed response to questions.\n\nZimbabwes foreign affairs spokesperson didnt respond to a request for comment.\n\nRelations between Zimbabwe and Western powers, including the UK, were largely cordial after independence in 1980, with Britain serving as the countrys biggest trading partner and a key source of aid supporting land reform and economic development. In 1997, the ties deteriorated after Britain refused to fund the land reform program. In a letter that November, the UK government said it had no colonial obligation to finance the program. That sparked tensions between the two countries and fueled debate over land redistribution in Zimbabwe.\n\nTwo years later, Zimbabwe defaulted on loan repayments, andin 2000, it began state-sanctioned farm seizures that displaced 4,500 White farmers and caused agricultural output to plunge. In response, the UK and other Western nations imposed sanctions, citing violations of property rights.\n\nBy 2024, the UK ranked as Zimbabwes 14th-largest trading partner, with total trade valued at $155 million  significantly overshadowed byChinas $3.9 billion and theUnited Arab Emiratess $2.9 billion.\n\nThe UKs renewed engagement with Zimbabwe reflects more than a diplomatic thaw and signals a strategic interest in critical minerals, particularly lithium, said Zaynab Hoosen, senior Africa analyst at Pangea-Risk, a specialist intelligence advisory firm. Zimbabwes substantial lithium reserves offer a timely opportunity to diversify supply chains and reduce reliance on dominant producers.\n\nWestern nations from the US to the UK are scouring the globe for greater access to critical minerals needed for clean energy, military infrastructure, advanced defense systems, semiconductors and electric-vehicle batteries.\n\nThe UK said in a policy paperlast monththat an upcoming critical minerals strategy will highlight the importance of forming targeted growth partnerships.\n\nIts strategy in Africa is undergoing an overhaul from traditional aid toward commercially focused, mutually beneficial ties under its newApproach to Africa,unveiled in June, Hoosen said. Recent moves include an infrastructure partnership withSouth Africa, which builds on existing cooperation in platinum group metals and the UKs first trade and investment mission to Angola, where UK-based firmPensana Plcis advancing theLongonjo Rare Earth Project.\n\nFor Zimbabwe, the benefits go beyond minerals diplomacy, as the stronger ties with the UK offer access to diversified investment, expanded trade and renewed international legitimacy, Hoosen added.\n\nThe improved relations also coincide with Zimbabwes economic diplomacy strategy adopted by its cabinet last month that prioritizes key sectors including mining, manufacturing and agriculture in foreign relations.\n\nZimbabwe is what it is because of the economic endowments that it has, Foreign Affairs and International Trade Minister Amon Murwira told a post-cabinet briefing on July 29 as he unveiled the new policy. The southern African nation wont hesitate to leverage on its natural resources to further its national interests, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) Thursday upheld the tight Monetary Policy stance as a strategy to conserve the local currency.\n\nPresenting the Mid-Term Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), premised under the theme Walking The Talk And Staying The Course, the central bank governor, Dr John Mushayavanhu, once again stated that the bank was receiving widespread acclaim for its sustained exchange rate stability.\n\nThe RBZ projected inflation to end the year at around 30%, giving a positive real interest rate of 5% and maintained the Bank Policy rate at 35% despite sustained outcry from industry on the need to ease the cost of borrowing.\n\nThe high policy rate has choked productivity in the recent past by worsening the cost of capital to fund critical industry needs. However, on its part, the RBZ believes that such rates are necessary to curb speculative borrowing.\n\nOn bank charges, the MPS implored banks to adhere to the measures announced in the February 2025 Monetary Policy Statement to exempt from bank charges all accounts that maintain a balance below US$100 or its equivalent in ZiG.\n\nIn addition, Point of Sale (POS) transactions for amounts less than US$5 or its equivalent in ZiG were also exempted from transaction charges for both banking institutions and Payment System Providers (PSPs).\n\nWhile a noble step, the move falls far short of addressing the thorn in flesh for the transacting public who are ordinarily forced to part ways with US$3,00 per every US$100 withdrawn from banks, a position which increases the cost of doing business, especially for corporates who withdraw large volumes of money.\n\nThe current statutory reserve requirements are set between 15% and 30% depending on the nature of the deposits. Banking institutions can, therefore, easily reduce the effective statutory reserve requirements towards 15% by attracting more long-term deposits.\n\nThe statutory reserve ratios, therefore, remain unchanged and will be reviewed when appropriate and consistent with the monetary policy thrust, reads the MPS in part.\n\nThis is despite complaints from the banking sector alleging that high statutory reserves are mopping up excess resources necessary to support productive lending.\n\nThe MPS maintained the export surrender thresholds at 30% but did not address the pertinent concerns raised by exporters who allege they have not been paid the ZWG portion for a prolonged period of time in what experts believe to be one of the strategies to protect the local unit.\n\nMarket watchers suspect that the move to withhold the export surrender thresholds for fear of weakening ZWG is an indication of a currency facing the crisis of fragility.\n\nDespite having triggered fears across the markets on impending monocurrency by 2030, Dr Mushayavanhus MPS did not disclose the practical roadmap to his course of action, instead opting to give assurances of a workable process.\n\nThe de-dollarisation roadmap will be crystallised in the National Development Strategy II and the Reserve Bank, which is chairing the NDS2 Thematic Working Group on Macroeconomic Stability and Financial Deepening (MESFIND) is currently seized with consultations on the issue.\n\nThe roadmap will undoubtedly encapsulate the need to maintain the current stability, preserve the foreign currency accounts and the value of the existing USD-denominated contracts. Consideration will always be made to ensure that there is business continuity and certainty, the MPS added.\n\n",
