For those due for (Antiretroviral Treatment) ART or PrEP refills, please proceed to the nearest city health clinic for assistance. Thank you for understanding, the notice states.\n\nPrEP is a medication that can help reduce your risk of contracting HIV through sexual contact.\n\nSome officials confirmed that testing services are the only offerings at this time.\n\nThe clinic is only open for those who want to be tested for HIV. We are currently not offering other services, officials at the reception explained.\n\nA similar situation is being reported in Masvingo.\n\nThe centre has typically provided integrated clinical services that included HIV testing, PrEP, TB screening and treatment, cervical cancer screening and treatment, as well as short-term and long-acting reversible contraceptives, and sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening and treatment, among other services.\n\nUpon his inauguration, Trump announced a range of changes to the United States funding model, emphasizing reasonable use of taxpayers money and prioritizing developments within the superpower itself.\n\nThis policy shift has led to millions of US dollars in funding being paused for local civil society organizations (CSOs), impacting billions globally.\n\nGiven that the United States is a significant funder of development in both the health and education sectors of Zimbabwe, there are growing concerns regarding the potential ramifications of these changes.\n\nThe US plays a crucial role in Zimbabwes efforts to combat sexually transmitted diseases and HIV, with PEPFAR providing funding for the majority of condoms and antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) distributed by local hospitals.\n\nCurrently, approximately 1.2 million Zimbabweans benefit from PEPFAR, and over 1,600 public hospitals and clinics have received training and technical support from the US government.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nHarare Mayor Jacob Mafume has pointed the finger at his wife in the growing controversy surrounding a luxury hostel inspection report he is building in Belvedere. Mafume told the retired High Court Judge Justice Maphios Cheda-led Commission of Inquiry today that his wife is overseeing the construction of the hostel intended to accommodate over 60 Harare Institute of Technology (HIT) students.\n\nThe property, allegedly acquired through kickbacks from South African firm Quill Associates (involved in Harare City Councils Enterprise Resource Plan), was reportedly built without adhering to council regulations regarding planning and inspection.\n\nMafume presented the commission with an inspection report showing six visits to the property in a single month, sometimes just three days apart, all seemingly documented with the same pen.\n\nTapiwa Fresh Godzi, leading the commissions evidence, questioned the speed of construction. I wonder at what rate the builders are working. Inspection after inspection every three days. Is that reasonable? he asked.Mafume maintained it was reasonable.\n\nCommission chairperson Justice Cheda inquired about the identity of the inspector. Mafume admitted he had never met the person face to face.\n\nThese people approving this building all have the same signature, correct? Justice Cheda asked. Mafume confirmed this and again, implicated his wife in the inspection furore.\n\nI have not met the inspector personally. They visit the site where there is a contractor. This is being handled by my wife, he stated.\n\nNewZimbabwe.com has learned that the City Council has no record of Mafume paying for any of the six inspections he presented to the commission. Sources say Mafume himself lacks receipts to prove payment.\n\nPayment is required for each inspection stage by city officials. Mafume made no payments and has no proof of payment for any of the inspections, a source stated.\n\nDuring his testimony, Mafume admitted he had not obtained council approval to change the propertys use from residential to commercial. Such changes require approval from the works and town planning committee, but Mafume made no application, and no committee meeting minutes exist approving the renovations.\n\nThe change of use plan does not exist. That one is not there, said a noticeably nervous Mafume.\n\nChange-of-use plans are typically paid for before construction begins.\n\nA typical building plan for the hostel Mafume is building costs around United States Dollars three thousand, which he has not paid to the council, a source said.\n\nThis represents a violation of by-laws that Mafume, as Harares mayor, is expected to uphold.\n\nAnother source claims Mafume used intermediaries to handle the hostel construction and the purchase of a Greendale mansion, avoiding direct involvement.\n\nThis, the source believes, was a strategy to evade scrutiny, but his shady deals have now come back to haunt him.\n\n",

I have pursued it in different Council meetings. I have taken the actions within my power.\n\nAs of current, because the properties are being constantly attached, I have suggested that the entity be put under management or what we used to call liquidation.

He denies all the allegations.\n\nNow the BBC has spoken to more than 20 people who worked with Combs at Bad Boy Records  including former executives, assistants and producers  who describe for the first time troubling incidents they say they witnessed during its 1990s rise.\n\nSome executives say they had concerns after seeing Combs having sex with women in the studio, including one incident where the employee says the young woman did not seem to react when he walked in. Another staff member complained Combs asked her to bring him condoms.\n\nThe BBC also heard that corporate funds were used to fly in women from across the US for sex at the request of artists and other employees.\n\nThere was a course of conduct that became more egregious over time and that conduct does go back to the 90s, says Tony Buzbee, a US lawyer representing dozens of alleged victims, including one who says Combs threatened to kill her in similar terms to the incident Evans says he witnessed.\n\nHis client alleges Combs raped her on a bathroom floor at a promotional party held for The Notorious B.I.G., the labels biggest star, in 1995. She says in her lawsuit that afterwards, Combs told her not to tell anyone or you will disappear.\n\nIn a statement, Combss legal team accused Buzbee of being more interested in media attention than the truth and said the hip-hop star never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone.\n\nThe 55-year-olds lawyers said they had not been provided with sufficient details about the BBCs claims to present the facts that would counter these fabricated accusations.\n\nAs weve said before, Mr Combs cannot dignify every publicity stunt or facially absurd claim with a response. He has full confidence in the judicial process, where the truth will prevail: these accusations are pure fiction, they said.\n\nA brash go-getter, Sean Combs became an overnight millionaire when he launched Bad Boy Records in 1993 with a roster of top artists.\n\nIt was Combss first venture, having already built a name for himself as a talent director at another music label, Uptown Records, aged 19.\n\nHe said that he wanted to be one of the biggest artists in the world and it didnt matter if I believed him or not, remembers Jimmy Maynes, a former Uptown colleague.\n\nMaynes remembers Combs having a short fuse in the office, sometimes banging his hands up against the desk like a bratty kid and yelling if he did not get his way.\n\nCombs was eventually fired from Uptown and at the age of 23 started Bad Boy Records.\n\nHes the hardest working man that Ive ever met and always wanted people to match his energy, says Daniel Evans, a senior executive who managed Bad Boys recording budgets and artists contracts between 1994 and 1997.\n\nCombs described himself as the Great Gatsby and swiftly became known for hosting coveted celebrity bashes at New York nightclubs, on the beaches of Cancun, Mexico, and later infamous White Parties  named after the all-white dress code  in the Hamptons.\n\nEven President Donald Trump attended events in the 90s, says Evans, who once saw him sit on a golden throne at Combss 30th birthday and exclaim: Im the real King of New York!\n\nWe were all really young. I was 24 years old, reflects Evans, who was one of the labels original employees. People wanted to party, have fun, hook up and build good memories.\n\nBut looking back, Evans says he is troubled by some of the things he witnessed about his bosss behaviour and the company culture.\n\nIn about 1995, he says he walked in on Combs having sex with a young woman at Daddys House, Bad Boys New York recording studio near Times Square.\n\nI was getting ready to go home for the night and looking for my jacket. Open the door and hes having sex with this girl, says Evans, who thought the studio was empty as it was silent. Combs swore and shouted at him to leave. I thought I was getting fired, he says.\n\nEvans remembers the young woman had been brought to the studio, presumably for a tour, by a party-promoter who was a friend of Combs. His boss seemed sober, while she was quiet and did not really talk, he says, wondering if she was high on drugs or just shy.\n\nHe says it did not seem unusual at the time. But recalling how the woman did not react when he entered the room, he says: Knowing what I know now, theres a lot of speculation about what state she was in usually both parties are very responsive during the act.\n\nFelicia Newsome, the manager of Daddys House recording studio between 1994 and 2000, says inappropriate conduct in the music industry as a whole was rife at the time.\n\nIt was abnormal if somebody reported it, but it wasnt abnormal for it to be happening, she says.\n\nNewsome says an employee once called her to the studio in the middle of the night because Combs was in his underwear, about to have sex with a model and another woman. He was demanding the staff member fetch him condoms, she recalls.\n\nI said to Puffy, dont ever ask anyone here to go and get condoms, says Newsome, who arrived while they were getting dressed again. He replied: I didnt need anything like that, ma, and never did it again.\n\nNewsome, then in her 30s, says she found Combs reasonable and that he changed his behaviour when she challenged him. On one occasion, when the studio first opened in 1995, she says Combs was unhappy about the look of the countertops and called her a bitch in front of staff.\n\nShe says she demanded a public apology and temporarily shut the studio, asking him: If Im bringing women into this space, which is open 24 hours, how do you want to treat people?\n\nCombs responded that he wanted it to be an inclusive and safe environment, she says.\n\nBut while Newsome ran the studio with an iron fist, she says other staff were less comfortable calling Combs out.\n\nBad Boy Records was a crazy house with a lot of young people who wanted to touch the Kings robes, she says.\n\nFormer staff say the label was run by twenty-something executives and a large number of interns, some of whom were of school age. There were often sexual relationships between employees and the interns, they say.\n\nEvans remembers an uncomfortable moment with a 14-year-old in his own team, who he says propositioned him.\n\nShe says to me, you work really hard. If you ever want to like, get loose, you and I should kick it but not tonight, I have a curfew.\n\nEvans says he sent her home and called the next day, telling her not to return to work. He did not report her, but two weeks later she was back working in the mailroom.\n\nArtists and other employees at Combss record label would sometimes also request for women to be flown in to have sex at the studio, the former executive says.\n\nIf they had a [sexual] specialty in something, they would be flown in, says Evans, who told the BBC he knew because he controlled the budgets. Money for the flights would be set aside and logged under travel, he adds.\n\nIt was probably like thousands of dollars, says Evans. I dont think it happened all that often, but it was definitely a recording expense.\n\nEvans says Combss own requests were managed by his personal assistants. One told the BBC that Combs would often ask them to fly in women he was messing around with and put them up in hotels, though the assistant said they were not sex workers.\n\nIn the 2000s, the Daddys House recording studio further changed, two former staff say, into a culture of sex, drugs and rocknroll. Combs would regularly bring random women there to party, turning up with an entourage of dozens of people in three white jeeps, with white rims and white leather seats, they say. Other artists would demand suitcases of Ciroc vodka and one even brought a monkey to a session, according to a former executive.\n\nThe studio is one of the locations where women have since accused Combs of drugging and raping them. Model Crystal McKinney alleges the mogul plied her with alcohol and marijuana before sexually assaulting her there in 2003. That same year, a woman alleges that Combs and two associates gang raped her at the studio when she was 17.\n\nCombss lawyers say he looks forward to proving his innocence, adding that McKinneys claims are without merit.\n\nMany ex-staff say they still find it hard to reconcile the allegations with the man they knew. These accusations are a surprise to me, as I am sure it is to many of our circle, says Jeffery Walker, a close friend of Combs who was part of Bad Boys original production team. Ive been to White Parties and of course studio sessions, and none of what he is accused of went down in my sight.\n\nEvans was also sceptical about some of the claims until he saw the footage of Casandra Ventura, Combss ex-partner of 10 years and a former Bad Boy artist, being brutally beaten by the rapper in a hotel in Los Angeles in 2016.\n\nVentura was the first person to sue Combs back in November 2023, alleging that he had trapped her in a cycle of abuse, violence, and sex trafficking during their relationship. Combs settled the lawsuit the next day for an undisclosed amount.\n\nIts not the first time Ive seen that temper, recalls Evans, thinking back to the death threat he says he witnessed back in 1997. Its hard to see. The guy in the video with Cassie is almost identical to the guy who threatened the employee. So, you wonder, has anything changed?\n\nOver the years, Sean Combs has repeatedly reinvented himself  from Puff Daddy, to P Diddy and in recent years, Love.\n\nIf Im acting crazy, like ahhh! thats Diddy. If Im dancing real smooth with a girl, thats Puff Daddy. And if Im looking like Im nervous or scared or shy, thats Sean, he said in an interview in 2015.\n\nWith more details likely to emerge when he goes on trial in May, many of those who were close to the rapper are questioning whether they knew the real Sean Combs at all.\n\nOne could think that hes just a disgusting human being, but thats not my memory of Puff, says Jimmy Maynes, who grew up with Combs in Mount Vernon, New York.\n\nBut after a pause, he adds: Or maybe money just gives people the freedom to be exactly who they really are, and he was that guy all along.\n\n",
