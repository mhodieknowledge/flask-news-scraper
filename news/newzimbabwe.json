Plural for the word is Zvigananda.\n\nThis is Obey Chimuka, the owner of Fossil Contracting. He has done so many projects and some people think his projects are my projectshis company is also behind the recent construction of the Mbare Musika Markethe is a Chigananda, said Tagwirei amid wild applause from the audience.\n\nChimuka, who is on the United Kingdom sanctions list, also owns Khaya Cement, formerly LaFarge.\n\nTagwirei, Chief Executive Officer of Sakunda Holdings, was at Masvingo Polytechnic College for the Leadership Success Series programme.\n\nThe utterances by Tagwirei, who doubles as Chairperson of the controversial Land Tenure Implementation Committee, did not sit well with Mnangagwas spokesperson George Charamba, who took to his shadowy X account Dhonzamusoro007 to register his disapproval.\n\nWrote Charamba, My message to Zimbabweans. We can never grow and develop when we give wealth-generating initiatives derogatory names!!!\n\nTitle is key to capitalism we live under. Simply, we must learn to play the game. Unless we want socialism and can have it!!!\n\n",

            "content": "By Cricinfo\n\nEngland 565 for 6 dec (Pope 171, Duckett 140, Crawley 124) beat Zimbabwe 265 (Bennett 139) and 255 (Williams 88, Raza 60, Bashir 6-81) by an innings and 45 runs\n\nENGLAND began their home international summer with a comprehensive win over Zimbabwe after bowling them out twice inside five sessions and finishing the four-day Test with more than a day to spare.Offspinner Shoaib Bashir, playing in his 16th Test, headlined the final day with his fourth Test five-for  the most by an England player before turning 22  and second in Nottingham.The magnitude of the defeat did not wipe the smiles off the faces of the visitors and their boisterous fans, who filled Trent Bridge with noise and colour, and stayed to applaud them in a lap of gratitude afterwards.This was Zimbabwes first Test in England in 22 years and a strong expat crowd delighted in brave batting from Sean Williams, Ben Curran, Sikandar Raza and Wessly Madhevere.Williams fell 12 short of a century and put on 122 for the second wicket while Raza reached a 10th Test half-century and shared a 65-run fifth-wicket stand with Madhevere.Zimbabwe did not disgrace themselves as they came within 45 runs of making England bat again and showed promise ahead of home Tests against South Africa, New Zealand and Afghanistan later this year.England, meanwhile, have had their first bit of preparation ahead of a massive eight months in Tests which includes a five-match home series against India and the Ashes in Australia.They may have some concerns over their frontline seamers, who lacked some bite. Captain Ben Stokes was the most threatening on his return to bowling after hamstring surgery, and also maintained the highest pace, across his two four-over spells. In total, he bowled 11.2 in the match, while Bashir finished with nine for 143, his best match figures.Zimbabwe began the day on 30 for 2, 270 runs behind and needing a big batting performance from someone. Williams, an international veteran of 20 years who averages 66.56 in the last five years, delivered.He played a typically energetic knock, laced with boundaries. He hit 16 fours in his innings, nine through the covers and mid-off as England overpitched and occasionally offered width. He also ushered Curran through a cautious knock that spanned 104 balls for 37 runs.Stokes began the mornings proceedings and immediately caused problems for Zimbabwe. His third ball was wide and full, Curran drove hard and edged past gully for four. Stokes would have known hed also planted a seed of doubt and in his next over, he could have reaped the rewards.On 10, Curran drove the ball back to Stokes, who stuck out both hands but could not hold on in his followthrough. That would have stung and more so when Williams smoked Stokes through point and over midwicket later in the over.Williams reached fifty in the next over with a pinpoint straight drive off Josh Tongue, off the 42nd ball he faced. In the next over, Tongue hit Williams on the bottom forearm, with a delivery that reared up from back of a length and drew blood. Williams was treated on-field and appeared unaffected as he drove a wide Atkinson ball in his favoured region for four more.Joe Root was used for an over for Tongue to change ends and England went double-spin with the introduction of Bashir. Williams reverse-swept his first ball for four to enter the seventies.At the other end Tongue began a short-ball assault on Curran that almost paid off. Curran, having hauled his way to 29, pulled Tongue to Stokes at midwicket but the England captain could only get fingertips to it.Curran survived again when Umpire Kumar Dharmasena gave him out lbw after he missed a sweep against Bashir but Curran reviewed. Hawkeye showed the ball was bouncing over the top of the stumps.Williams was not quite as lucky. On 88, he was hit on the pads, given out and reviewed. Replays showed the ball was clipping the top of the leg stump. Having faced 82 balls, he had been on course to reclaim the national record for fastest century that Brian Bennetts 97-ball effort had taken on the previous day.Post-lunch, Curran adopted a more aggressive approach and drove Bashir aerially but only as far as Stokes at short cover, for whom the third time was a charm.He had no trouble holding on. That brought Raza and Madhevere together and they took on the spin and the short ball from Sam Cook with confidence.They had a couple of nervy moments: when Bashir induced Razas edge once and the ball ricocheted off Jamie Smith and onto the peak of Harry Brooks cap at first slip, which saved him from being hit on the forehead. Then, Cook got a full ball to jag back into Madhevere and hit his front pad and convinced Stokes to review. Ball-tracking showed it was missing leg stump.In the end it took a moment of magic, and the return of Stokes, to separate the pair. He went short to Madhevere and found extra bounce, Madhevere attempted a cut but found an outside-edge and the ball seemed to be heading over second slip.Brook jumped, stuck his right hand up and plucked the ball out of the air, to everyones surprise. Madhevere looked back, astonished that he had to go while Stokes placed his hand over his mouth a la Stuart Broad, who celebrated in the same way when Stokes himself pulled off a blinder in the Ashes a decade ago on the same ground.With Madhevere went Zimbabwes last real hope of making England bat again and the result was only a matter of time. Tafadzwa Tsiga was bowled by Bashir when he came down the track to a ball that turned in and through the bat-pad gap.Zimbabwean emotions see-sawed as Raza reached fifty in the next over when he creamed Stokes through the covers for his eighth four but in the over after that Blessing Muzarabani slog-swept Bashir straight to Root at deep midwicket. Bashir bagged his fifth when Raza, who had added two more fours to his count, tried to heave him over the leg side and managed a leading edge which Brook pouched.Fittingly, Bashir finished things off when he struck Chivanga on the back pad as he played inside the line and was hit in front of middle and off. Richard Ngarava, Zimbabwes No.11, did not bat in either innings after leaving the field on the first day with a back injury.\n\nENGLAND began their home international summer with a comprehensive win over Zimbabwe after bowling them out twice inside five sessions and finishing the four-day Test with more than a day to spare.\n\nOffspinner Shoaib Bashir, playing in his 16th Test, headlined the final day with his fourth Test five-for  the most by an England player before turning 22  and second in Nottingham.The magnitude of the defeat did not wipe the smiles off the faces of the visitors and their boisterous fans, who filled Trent Bridge with noise and colour, and stayed to applaud them in a lap of gratitude afterwards.This was Zimbabwes first Test in England in 22 years and a strong expat crowd delighted in brave batting from Sean Williams, Ben Curran, Sikandar Raza and Wessly Madhevere.Williams fell 12 short of a century and put on 122 for the second wicket while Raza reached a 10th Test half-century and shared a 65-run fifth-wicket stand with Madhevere.Zimbabwe did not disgrace themselves as they came within 45 runs of making England bat again and showed promise ahead of home Tests against South Africa, New Zealand and Afghanistan later this year.England, meanwhile, have had their first bit of preparation ahead of a massive eight months in Tests which includes a five-match home series against India and the Ashes in Australia.They may have some concerns over their frontline seamers, who lacked some bite.

Hawkeye showed the ball was bouncing over the top of the stumps.Williams was not quite as lucky. On 88, he was hit on the pads, given out and reviewed. Replays showed the ball was clipping the top of the leg stump. Having faced 82 balls, he had been on course to reclaim the national record for fastest century that Brian Bennetts 97-ball effort had taken on the previous day.Post-lunch, Curran adopted a more aggressive approach and drove Bashir aerially but only as far as Stokes at short cover, for whom the third time was a charm.He had no trouble holding on. That brought Raza and Madhevere together and they took on the spin and the short ball from Sam Cook with confidence.They had a couple of nervy moments: when Bashir induced Razas edge once and the ball ricocheted off Jamie Smith and onto the peak of Harry Brooks cap at first slip, which saved him from being hit on the forehead. Then, Cook got a full ball to jag back into Madhevere and hit his front pad and convinced Stokes to review. Ball-tracking showed it was missing leg stump.In the end it took a moment of magic, and the return of Stokes, to separate the pair. He went short to Madhevere and found extra bounce, Madhevere attempted a cut but found an outside-edge and the ball seemed to be heading over second slip.Brook jumped, stuck his right hand up and plucked the ball out of the air, to everyones surprise. Madhevere looked back, astonished that he had to go while Stokes placed his hand over his mouth a la Stuart Broad, who celebrated in the same way when Stokes himself pulled off a blinder in the Ashes a decade ago on the same ground.With Madhevere went Zimbabwes last real hope of making England bat again and the result was only a matter of time. Tafadzwa Tsiga was bowled by Bashir when he came down the track to a ball that turned in and through the bat-pad gap.Zimbabwean emotions see-sawed as Raza reached fifty in the next over when he creamed Stokes through the covers for his eighth four but in the over after that Blessing Muzarabani slog-swept Bashir straight to Root at deep midwicket. Bashir bagged his fifth when Raza, who had added two more fours to his count, tried to heave him over the leg side and managed a leading edge which Brook pouched.Fittingly, Bashir finished things off when he struck Chivanga on the back pad as he played inside the line and was hit in front of middle and off. Richard Ngarava, Zimbabwes No.11, did not bat in either innings after leaving the field on the first day with a back injury.\n\nWilliams fell 12 short of a century and put on 122 for the second wicket while Raza reached a 10th Test half-century and shared a 65-run fifth-wicket stand with Madhevere.\n\nZimbabwe did not disgrace themselves as they came within 45 runs of making England bat again and showed promise ahead of home Tests against South Africa, New Zealand and Afghanistan later this year.England, meanwhile, have had their first bit of preparation ahead of a massive eight months in Tests which includes a five-match home series against India and the Ashes in Australia.They may have some concerns over their frontline seamers, who lacked some bite. Captain Ben Stokes was the most threatening on his return to bowling after hamstring surgery, and also maintained the highest pace, across his two four-over spells. In total, he bowled 11.2 in the match, while Bashir finished with nine for 143, his best match figures.Zimbabwe began the day on 30 for 2, 270 runs behind and needing a big batting performance from someone. Williams, an international veteran of 20 years who averages 66.56 in the last five years, delivered.He played a typically energetic knock, laced with boundaries. He hit 16 fours in his innings, nine through the covers and mid-off as England overpitched and occasionally offered width. He also ushered Curran through a cautious knock that spanned 104 balls for 37 runs.Stokes began the mornings proceedings and immediately caused problems for Zimbabwe. His third ball was wide and full, Curran drove hard and edged past gully for four. Stokes would have known hed also planted a seed of doubt and in his next over, he could have reaped the rewards.On 10, Curran drove the ball back to Stokes, who stuck out both hands but could not hold on in his followthrough. That would have stung and more so when Williams smoked Stokes through point and over midwicket later in the over.Williams reached fifty in the next over with a pinpoint straight drive off Josh Tongue, off the 42nd ball he faced. In the next over, Tongue hit Williams on the bottom forearm, with a delivery that reared up from back of a length and drew blood. Williams was treated on-field and appeared unaffected as he drove a wide Atkinson ball in his favoured region for four more.Joe Root was used for an over for Tongue to change ends and England went double-spin with the introduction of Bashir.

Richard Ngarava, Zimbabwes No.11, did not bat in either innings after leaving the field on the first day with a back injury.\n\nOn 10, Curran drove the ball back to Stokes, who stuck out both hands but could not hold on in his followthrough. That would have stung and more so when Williams smoked Stokes through point and over midwicket later in the over.\n\nWilliams reached fifty in the next over with a pinpoint straight drive off Josh Tongue, off the 42nd ball he faced. In the next over, Tongue hit Williams on the bottom forearm, with a delivery that reared up from back of a length and drew blood. Williams was treated on-field and appeared unaffected as he drove a wide Atkinson ball in his favoured region for four more.Joe Root was used for an over for Tongue to change ends and England went double-spin with the introduction of Bashir. Williams reverse-swept his first ball for four to enter the seventies.At the other end Tongue began a short-ball assault on Curran that almost paid off. Curran, having hauled his way to 29, pulled Tongue to Stokes at midwicket but the England captain could only get fingertips to it.Curran survived again when Umpire Kumar Dharmasena gave him out lbw after he missed a sweep against Bashir but Curran reviewed. Hawkeye showed the ball was bouncing over the top of the stumps.Williams was not quite as lucky. On 88, he was hit on the pads, given out and reviewed. Replays showed the ball was clipping the top of the leg stump. Having faced 82 balls, he had been on course to reclaim the national record for fastest century that Brian Bennetts 97-ball effort had taken on the previous day.Post-lunch, Curran adopted a more aggressive approach and drove Bashir aerially but only as far as Stokes at short cover, for whom the third time was a charm.He had no trouble holding on. That brought Raza and Madhevere together and they took on the spin and the short ball from Sam Cook with confidence.They had a couple of nervy moments: when Bashir induced Razas edge once and the ball ricocheted off Jamie Smith and onto the peak of Harry Brooks cap at first slip, which saved him from being hit on the forehead. Then, Cook got a full ball to jag back into Madhevere and hit his front pad and convinced Stokes to review. Ball-tracking showed it was missing leg stump.In the end it took a moment of magic, and the return of Stokes, to separate the pair. He went short to Madhevere and found extra bounce, Madhevere attempted a cut but found an outside-edge and the ball seemed to be heading over second slip.Brook jumped, stuck his right hand up and plucked the ball out of the air, to everyones surprise. Madhevere looked back, astonished that he had to go while Stokes placed his hand over his mouth a la Stuart Broad, who celebrated in the same way when Stokes himself pulled off a blinder in the Ashes a decade ago on the same ground.With Madhevere went Zimbabwes last real hope of making England bat again and the result was only a matter of time.

He is lawfully in Zimbabwe and is just but a pure businessman who is creating employment for Zimbabweans and contributing to the national fiscus.Our clients reputation has been severely damaged and now on the verge of losing many lucrative contracts and has the real risk of being declared the enemy of the peace-loving Zimbabwean government and being called a person of interest by the Zimbabwean law enforcement agents.We enjoin you to take these allegations seriously, failing which you will only have yourselves to blame.In the event that you fail to retract the defamatory statement as demanded our client shall proceed to issue summons and claim damages for defamation as well as lodge a criminal complaint against those who run the website and/or your social media pages without any further notice to you.\n\nNiyonsaba, who owns Fresh Kambucha Zimbabwe, gave the two publications 12 hours to act, in letters sent on May 23 by his lawyer Admire Rubaya.\n\nFailure, he said, will result in his client instituting legal proceedings, to get managers of both publications arrested and prosecuted for malicious damage to his clients image and that of his company.The letter was also copied to Police Commissioner General Stephen Mutamba.Circumstances are that the two produced a report indicating Niyonsaba as one of many Ugandan nationals running cover companies, including tuckshops, that were financing Rwandan secret service operatives in an operation targeting suspects of the world infamous 1994 genocide.The article was titled Kagame intelligence agents allegedly involved in killings of genocide suspects in Zimbabwe.The statement that you published on your website is defamatory and was understood by a reasonable reader, follower or social media user that our client is an illicit business which is a front for the Rwandan Intelligence services which houses terrorists and criminals who are killing people allegedly connected to the Rwanda 1994 genocide, said Rubaya in the letter.You have actively discouraged your followers and other social media users from purchasing the product (Fresh Kambucha), thereby potentially harming our clients reputation and business interests.He has no connection whatsoever to the Rwandan Intelligence Services or any of the individuals that you alleged he works with to fund the alleged extra judicial killings.He does not house any terrorists who are allegedly conducting the alleged extra judicial killings and that he is not involved in spying for the Rwandan Intelligence Services.Further allegations that Fresh Kambucha had not undergone rigorous tests to prove its safety, were said to have significantly affected Niyonsabas business.Added Rubaya: Our client has a traceable record of clean and well manufactured Kambucha drinks, which have been scientifically tested to the extent that no adverse report has been authored by the relevant authorities.Our client is a genuine international investor who originates from the great country of Uganda, which is led by the African son Yoweri Kaguta Museveni.
