Unfortunately, her condition continued to deteriorate, leading to her death on 5th October 2025, ZRP national spokesperson, Commissioner Paul Nyathi said in a statement.It was during the childs burial when rumour started circulating that the deceased may have been poisoned leading villagers to alert Chief Ziki, who then instructed the victims mother to report the case to the police.Following investigations Gamera implicated Kwanga as the person who advised her to poison the child as well as Tavengerarwei as the supplier of the poison.Police have since recovered rat poison and a liquid substance suspected to be a cotton pesticide, believed to have been used in the commission of the offence.Meanwhile, the body of the victim has been exhumed and taken to Silveira Mission Hospital mortuary for a post-mortem examination.Nyathi urged members of the public to resolve disputes through lawful and peaceful means.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) confirmed that Sabina Maziva (4) died a week ago after she was allegedly fed the poisoned food by a neighbour, Violet Gamera (60), who accused the childs parents of letting their goats stray and destroy her crops.\n\nGamera, along with Chamunorwa Kwanga (60) and Regina Tavengerarwei (30), have since been arrested as police continue investigating the suspected murder.Initial investigations reveal that on 1st October 2025, Violet Gamera allegedly gave the victim poisoned rice as an act of revenge against the childs parents, whose goats had previously destroyed her crops.The child later began vomiting and was referred to a local clinic, where she received medical attention.

The situation has now reached a defining moment tasvika kumagumo (we have reached the end), Geza said.\n\nEmmerson has chosen to betray the people of Zimbabwe, aligning himself with his criminal cartels, the Zviganandas. He has opted for corruption, looting and open normalisation of thievery within our very government.\n\nEmmerson has chosen to brutally mutilate our Constitution, massacring the rights of Zimbabweans to the dignity of life through his corrupt machinations. He is the Godfather of corrupt elements, the outspoken ex-guerrilla fighter said.\n\nWe want an uprising from Plumtree to Mutare, from Zambezi to Limpopo. Everyone must flood the streets  Mnangagwa must go, Geza said in the video.\n\nThe call comes as Zimbabwe faces growing political uncertainty, with reports of internal divisions in the ruling Zanu PF party and rising frustration over economic hardships.\n\nGeza noted that the time was ripe for masses to act decisively and end Mnangagwas tyranny and plunder of national coffers put at a staggering US$7 billion.\n\nThe time for our suffering has ended. Today marks the final steps to dismantle this madness. We will nolonger standby and let Emmerson and his Zviganandas rob our people of the future and sacred right to vote in 2028. We will nolonger tolerate the resolution seeking to postpone elections, somehow said to represent the will of the people. This is the gravest insult to the dignity of Zimbabweans.\n\nGeza urged Zimbabweans from all walks of life to participate in streets demonstrations set for next Friday coinciding with the climax of the Zanu PF Annual National Peoples Conference set for Mutare Polytechnic, from 13 to 18, 2025.\n\nOn Friday, 17 October, fellow Zimbabweans, lets say no to State capture by (Kuda) Tagwirei, (Wicknell) Chivayo and their fellow Zviganandas.\n\nLets say no to the looting of our State resources, when civil servants are poorly paid, lets say no to the looting of billions when our people die in hospitals without medication, when our women give birth in open spaces.\n\nThis country doesnt belong to Emmerson, his wife and criminal cartels, declared Geza, who is largely viewed to be bidding for Vice President Constantino Chiwenga to take over the presidency come 2028.\n\nThe struggle must continue until every Zimbabwean is free from tyranny, Geza said.\n\n",

A very positive and productive one, Zelenskyy said on Facebook, congratulating Trump for his outstanding ceasefire plan in the Middle East.If a war can be stopped in one region, then surely other wars can be stopped as well, including the Russian war, Zelenskyy added, calling for Trump to pressure the Kremlin into negotiations.Relations between the two leaders have warmed dramatically since February when they sparred during a televised meeting at the White House.Trump has since grown more hostile towards Russia while expressing sympathy for Ukraine.In September, he wrote on Truth Social that Kyiv should try to take back all its occupied territory with Europes and NATOs help.US first lady Melania Trump said on Friday that she had secured the release of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia after establishing an extraordinary back channel of communication with Putin.Russian attacks on Ukraine killed at least five people on Saturday and cut power to parts of southern Ukraines Odesa region, according to Ukrainian officials.Two of the people died inside a church in Kostyantynivka when it was hit by a strike, according to local authorities.Ukraines largest private energy company, DTEK, said the main work to restore the power supply was completed but some localised outages were still affecting the Ukrainian capital after Fridays massive Russian attacks.Ukrainian drone attacks, meanwhile, killed two people in Russia, according to regional officials.In the Russian border region of Belgorod, a truck driver was killed by a Ukrainian strike, according to local officials.Russia has targeted Ukraines energy grid each winter since it launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, cutting power and heating to millions of households and disrupting water supplies in what Kyiv says is a brazen war crime.Russia denies targeting civilians and says Ukraine uses the energy sites to power its military sector.Both countries have accused each other in recent months of frustrating progress towards a peace deal.Russia blames Ukraine and its European allies for the impasse, accusing them of undermining peace negotiations with Washington. Ukraine and Europe accuse Russia of playing for time so it can seize more Ukrainian territory.Zelenskyy said in his nightly address on Friday that Russia was taking advantage of the world being almost entirely focused on the prospect of establishing peace in the Middle East and called for strengthening Ukraines air defence systems and placing tighter sanctions on Russia.Russian assets must be fully used to strengthen our defence and ensure recovery, he said in the video, posted to X.\n\nSaturdays call came a day after Russia launched a large-scale attack on Ukraines energy grid, knocking out power to parts of the capital, Kyiv, and nine other Ukrainian regions, which have since been restored.\n\nDiplomatic efforts to end Russias invasion of Ukraine have slowed in recent weeks, in part because global attention has shifted to brokering a ceasefire in Israels war on Gaza, Kyiv said.Trump, who announced the first phase of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on Wednesday, met Russian President Vladimir Putin for talks in August but failed to secure progress on a ceasefire in the European war.I had a call with US President Donald Trump.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nAS the Zanu PF annual conference kicks off this week, the ruling party is urging discipline within its rank-and-file amid social media claims alleging plans to heckle Vice President Constantino Chiwenga during the event, as the succession debate intensifies.\n\nChiwenga is widely regarded as the frontrunner to succeed President Emmerson Mnangagwa in 2028 when his second term expires. However, his path to the presidencywhile seemingly straightforwardis reportedly being obstructed by Mnangagwas loyalists, who are pushing for an extension of the Presidents tenure to 2030.\n\nAmong these loyalists is a group of controversial business figures, including convicted businessman Wicknell Chivayo, Paul Tungwarara, and Kudakwashe Tagwirei, who have publicly and repeatedly pledged to support Mnangagwas continued leadership beyond 2028.\n\nIn recent days, social media has been awash with claims that Zanu PF youths are being bussed to Mutare, Manicaland province, for the sole purpose of booing Chiwengaa development seen as a sign that the succession battle is escalating.\n\nZanu PF Director of Communication, Farai Marapira, dismissed the allegations, insisting that the partys conference would not be used to heckle senior leaders, as attendance is restricted to vetted delegates.\n\nWe are not going to a rally. We are going to a conference. This is not a free for all. This is a meeting of delegates. This is a meeting of leadership. There is no time to heckle. This is just once again social media trying its best to push agendas on us as Zanu PF. But of course it will fail, he said.\n\nMarapira further stated that those promoting claims of planned disruption were ignorant of the partys internal procedures.\n\nThis issue of being bussed to boo, how are they going to enter when they are not accredited? We are not accrediting crowds, we are accrediting delegates. This is mischief being created by people who are ignorant of the ways of the party and how it conducts its conferences, Marapira said.\n\nThe alleged plans to heckle Chiwenga come against the backdrop of his sustained stance against corruption, which he has consistently described as a threat to national security. Chiwenga has publicly condemned prominent businessmenamong them Chivayo, Tungwarara, Tagwirei, and Delish Nguwayathough without naming them directly, referring instead to the group as Zvigananda a deragatory term for plunderers.\n\nLast month, Chiwenga reportedly presented a detailed corruption dossier during a Zanu PF Politburo meeting, implicating Nguwaya, Chivayo, Tagwirei, and Tungwarara. Analysts claim the dossier was so damaging that President Mnangagwa had to abandon his planned trip to the United States, where he was scheduled to lead Zimbabwes campaign for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.\n\n",
