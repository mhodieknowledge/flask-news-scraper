He stands accused of indiscipline and fostering factionalism.\n\nThis comes after he publicly opposed the extension of Mnangagwas tenure beyond the constitutionally mandated two-term limit, which is due to end in 2028.\n\nAnnouncing Gezas expulsion, ZANU PFs Secretary for Legal Affairs, Patrick Chinamasa, said that Geza had acted in a manner tantamount to treason.\n\nBlessed Geza\n\nI think all of you are aware of utterances by Cde Geza which sought to undermine the party leadership, ZANU PF and over and above that which was an attack on the state machinery, basically a treason against the state.\n\nWhat is clear, of course, is that Cde Geza was disloyal to the party in terms of Article 19(1) of the partys constitution. Blessed Geza violated all of those provisions. Any member of the party should not make or behave in a manner which brings the name of the party into disrepute.\n\nTaking all the allegations against Blessed Geza which are all in the public purview the politburo on the recommendation of the national disciplinary committee upheld that Blessed Geza should be expelled from ZANU PF with immediate effect, said Chinamasa.\n\nGeza leads a faction of disgruntled ex-combatants frustrated by the entrenchment of corruption in the country.\n\nHis expulsion comes as Mnangagwa, on Tuesday, issued a stern warning against indiscipline among ZANU PF members.\n\nGeza is among several members, including Member of Parliament (MP) Benjamin Ganyiwa and Godwin Gomwe, who have been shown the door from ZANU PF headquarters over allegations of indiscipline.\n\nChinamasa stated that the expulsion signals the partys firm stance against members who act against ZANU PFs interests.\n\nMuch of the deliberations dwelt on discipline, unity to protect the party from divisions. The decisions reflect the politburos desire to stamp its authority on issues of discipline.\n\nFrom today onwards, we will be known as a no-nonsense party to any mischief or any misdemeanors, any factionalism, any misbehaviour that will be taking place in the party. We must preserve our unity as a party, and it is very important that we must chuck out or discipline those who we feel are threatening the unity of ZANU PF, he added.\n\n",

The BBC has not been able to confirm the casualty figures.\n\nMondlanes team said two children from a nearby school had died from the shooting. It said 16 people had been injured, including their camera person, with others seriously affected by tear gas.\n\nIn a statement, it said Mondlanes condition was unknown, and his whereabouts are causing concern among his entire team.\n\nA video shared on social media shows the moment when gunshots started ringing out as the procession approached what looks like an armoured vehicle on the streets. People run for safety and the crowds disappear, while the gunfire continues.\n\nMore images of people bloodied from the incident have also been shared online.\n\nA witness, who was among the protesters, told the AFP news agency that police had started shooting, as if it was an ambush scenario. It was just a march.\n\nI saw some people bleeding from their wounds. My friend was wounded in the leg. I also saw a child who was shot and lost his life in hospital, AFP quoted 27-year old protester Silvestre Alexandre as saying.\n\nMozambiques former colonial power, Portugal, has condemned the unacceptable attack on Venncio Mondlanes convoy while calling for restraint from violence and respect for fundamental rights.\n\nIn a post on X, the Portuguese foreign affairs ministry has also offered condolences to the bereavedfamilies.\n\nSince President Chapo took over in January, he has made promises for a broad political dialogue that would include various sectors of the society, in order to end the countrys post-election crisis.\n\nSome analysts have however criticised him for excluding Mondlane from the talks.\n\nOn Wednesday, Mondlane condemned the political deal, calling it an agreement of people without the people. He said that protests would continue.\n\nIf they dont do what the people want, they wont govern Mozambique, he said.\n\nSince October, close to 400 people have died in violence linked to the protests, according to civil society organisations.\n\n",

            "content": "TheIndependent\n\nThe number of people living with Parkinsons disease worldwide could more than double by 2050, a study suggests.\n\nThe predicted rise is largely down to an ageing population, researchers said.\n\nA modelling study led by academics in Beijing used data from the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021 to estimate the prevalence of Parkinsons disease from 2022 to 2050 in 195 countries.\n\nThe findings, published in the BMJ, suggest the number of people living with the condition in 2050 will be 25.2 million, a 112% increase compared to 2021.\n\nBy 2050 Parkinsons disease will have become a greater public health challenge for patients, their families, care givers, communities, and society, researchers said.\n\nThe team suggests the upward trend is more pronounced in men, in East Asia and in countries with middle socio-demographic index, which is a scale that measures a countrys level of development based on the likes of average income, education and fertility rate.\n\nAccording to their estimations, cases in the UK could climb from 230,000 by 2030, to 272,000 by 2040 and 307,000 by 2050.\n\nResearchers said population ageing was estimated to be the leading contributor to rising cases, adding that their projections can be used to plan control measures and call for urgent actions in meeting the increasing healthcare demands of patients with the illness.\n\nParkinsons is a progressive condition that affects the brain.\n\nSymptoms include involuntary shaking known as tremors, slow movements and stiff muscles, as well as psychological problems like depression, loss of balance, trouble sleeping and memory issues.\n\nAcademics suggest public health interventions could be promising in slowing the universal rise in cases.\n\nThey added: Given the inevitable population ageing, population growth, and disability experienced by individuals with Parkinsons disease owing to its chronic nature, an urgent need exists for future research to focus on the development of novel drugs, gene engineering techniques, and cell replacement therapies that are aimed at modifying the course of the disease and improving patients quality of life.\n\nDavid Dexter,director of research at Parkinsons UK, said: This very welcome study reminds us that Parkinsons is growing quickly across the world.\n\nYet, in the UK today, our investment in research is failing to respond to this anticipated growth and people with Parkinsons are not getting the healthcare and services they need to live well.\n\nUntil we find a cure, its vital that people with Parkinsons, regardless of their location, socioeconomic group or race, have access to research opportunities, good quality care and support that enables them to live well with the condition.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nLesothos government says it is shocked by US President Donald Trump saying that nobody has ever heard of the southern African nation.\n\nTrump, addressing the US Congress in his first speech since his return to the Oval Office, made the reference as he listed cuts made to what he said was wasteful expenditure.\n\nEight million dollars to promote LGBTQI+ in the African nation of Lesotho, which nobody has ever heard of, Trump said, eliciting laughter from some US lawmakers.\n\nA spokesperson for Lesothos foreign affairs department told the BBC that Lesotho enjoyed warm and cordial relations with the US.\n\nLesotho is one of the biggest beneficiaries of the USs African Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa), which gives favourable trade access to some countries to promote their economic growth.\n\nAccording to the US government, the two countries traded goods worth $240m (187m) in 2024, mostly exports from Lesotho to the US, in particular textiles and clothing.\n\nLesothos Foreign Affairs Minister Lejone Mpotjoane said it was shocking to hear a head of state refer to another sovereign state in that manner.\n\nTo my surprise, the country that nobody has heard of is the country where the US has a permanent mission, Mpotjoane told the BBC.\n\nLesotho is a member of the UN and of a number of other international bodies. And the US has an embassy here and [there are] a number of US organisations weve accommodated here in Maseru.\n\nHe later told the AFP news agency: We are not taking this matter lightly, adding that they would send an official protest letter to Washington.\n\nOfficials dismissed Trumps remarks as off the cuff and a political statement, adding that they were uncalled-for given the good relations between the two nations.\n\nWe maintain very warm and cordial relations with the US. Theyve got a mission in Maseru and we also have [one] in Washington, foreign affairs spokesperson Kutloano Pheko told the BBC.\n\nMr Pheko was unable to confirm Trumps comments on the funding that went to LGBTQ organisations, saying that as the money went directly to them, they would be best placed to comment.\n\nMpotjoane, on his part, confirmed that the country had been affected by Trumps sudden decision to pause aid funding to countries around the world.\n\nMany organisations, mostly non-governmental, were thrown into chaos after the Trump administration announced a permanent end to the US Presidents Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) funding as part of a wider cost-cutting drive to reduce US government spending.\n\nPepfar was launched in 2003 by then US President George W Bush and its finances are distributed via the US governments main overseas aid agency USAID, whose funding has also been cut.\n\nLesotho is among those countries that benefited from Pepfar, its health ministry told South African publication GroundUp in February, with TB and HIV programmes among those receiving the critical funds.\n\nBut Mpotjoane declined to criticise this decision, saying it was the USs prerogative to cut aid if they want to.\n\n",
