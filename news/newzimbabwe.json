            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nPutting lipstick on a pig  this old adage aptly summarises the superficial renovations carried out at Rufaro Stadium by the Harare City Council.\n\nRufaro Stadium was reopened last year after years of closure, with Harare Mayor Jacob Mafume touting the facility as one of the best in Zimbabwe, even comparing its pitch to Spains Santiago Bernabeu Stadium.\n\nMafume enthusiastically described Rufaro Stadium as a lush green venue, celebrating the achievement of reopening the imposing structure in Mbare.\n\nHowever, less than a year after its reopening, Rufaro is already showing signs of deterioration, with the superficial facelift beginning to unravel.\n\nThe stadium has hosted four matches in eight days as the 2025 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League kicked off last week.\n\nIn the rains, the pitch is prone to waterlogging, with large patches of thick, sticky mud covering parts of the field.\n\nThis is in stark contrast to Mafumes assurances that a proper drainage system had been installed during the renovations.\n\nSpeaking recently at a council meeting, Mafume praised the developments at Rufaro, saying that the aim was to bring international football back to Mbare.\n\nWe are the biggest investors in sport in this country as the City of Harare. Every weekend, something is happening in Harare. Our contribution to sport is not something that should be taken lightly. We must improve Rufaro Stadium, Gwanzura Stadium, and many other stadiums in the city, he said.\n\nWe are happy that we have six teams in the PSL, and our next goal is to bring international soccer back to the streets of Harare.\n\nHowever, with the league still in its early stages, questions are being raised overRufaro Stadiums readiness to host multiple matches.\n\nDynamos, CAPS United, ZPC Kariba, and Herentals are using the stadium for their home matches, as renovations at the National Sports Stadium are yet to be completed.\n\nDespite these plans, Rufaro Stadium remains far from meeting the standards required to host international matches, with several areas falling short.\n\nMafume deceived football fans when the City Council, through a deal with Henriatta Rushwayas Okima Plastics, installed bucket seats in a small section of Rufaro Stadium.\n\nThe situation raises concerns about the sustainability of the renovations and whether the stadium can withstand the demands of a full football season, let alone attract international fixtures.\n\nZimbabwe is burdened with a lack of proper facilities that have forced football teams to play outside the country with the situation predicted to exacerbate with a visible pack of appetite by relevant authorities to address the dire situation.\n\n",

After all, Parliament has the responsibility of oversight and to ensure the efficient use of national resources.\n\nI, therefore appeal to you Mr. Speaker, for the Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs to favour this very House with a Ministerial Statement on how the Executive is tackling the question of corruption, including how far the Executive has gone in terms of the whistleblowers protection legislation and the witness protection legislation, said Hlatywayo.\n\nThe entrenchment of corruption has been attributed to inefficiencies within key institutions, such as the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC). ZACC has faced criticism for its perceived leniency towards individuals associated with the ruling party, ZANU PF.\n\nAdditionally, the absence of robust legislation to protect whistleblowers has been identified as a significant obstacle in the fight against corruption.\n\nSpeaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda emphasised the urgency of tabling the Whistleblowers Act in the National Assembly.\n\nI am not sure about the agreement. What I can only advise in support of part of what you have said is the Whistleblowers Bill that must come as soon as possible to this House. As for the indexes, I have my reservation, said Mudenda.\n\nMeasures to curb corruption are among the key areas Zimbabwe must address as part of the Structured Dialogue Platform between the country and the African Development Bank (AfDB).\n\n",

President Donald Trump has been dismantling US foreign aid affecting everything from health care to food supplies  Washington provides nearly half of WFPs $9.7 billion budget.\n\nWe have reached the difficult decision to close WFPs regional bureau for southern Africa in Johannesburg, McCain said in the email seen by Bloomberg. Challenging times demand some difficult choices.\n\nThe southern Africa bureau buys and transports hundreds of thousands of tons from South Africa and other countries. It procures more than 60% of its food, goods and services locally, WFP said on its website. The region is regularly hit by droughts because its periodically affected by the El Nino weather phenomenon, as it was last year.\n\nThe WFPs regional director and media team didnt respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nThe WFP has been instrumental in raising funds for countries such as Zimbabwe and Mozambique as they contend with the impact of the worst drought in at least four decades, which slashed corn harvests by as much as 70%.\n\nSome of the responsibilities of the bureau, which manages the response and deals with WFP country offices in a region spanning from South Africa to the Democratic Republic of Congo, will be taken over by the East African bureau in Nairobi, McCain said in the email.\n\nMcCain said the agency remains committed to southern Africa, adding that a transition and integration team will be established to implement the changes over the course of the year.\n\nThe 160 employees in the Johannesburg office were initially told their bureau might be combined with the one in Nairobi, a person familiar with the situation said. On February 27, Carl Skau, McCains deputy, was in Johannesburg and told staff that a decision had been taken to close the office, surprising everyone including senior management, the person said. McCains email arrived a day later.\n\nSouth Africas Department of International Relations & Cooperation has been informed, the person said. The department said it will respond to Bloombergs query later.\n\n",

The EBITDA margin increased by 3.2 percentage points.\n\nThe decrease in revenue was mainly due to a decline in the revenue in PPCs Zimbabwe operations, while the South Africa and Botswana operation delivered a flat performance.\n\nThe increase in EBITDA and EBITDA margins was due to all business units improving their results, mainly as a consequence of the turnaround plan, PPC directors said in a statement.\n\nCapital expenditure was expected to be slightly below the guidance of R400 million to R450m for the full year. Some optimisation of capital expenditure was being re-assessed, while maintenance expenditure was as planned.\n\nAs the stringent focus on costs and working capital take effect, the South Africa & Botswana operations free cash flow net cash inflow before financing activities excluding dividends from Zimbabwe  increased by a substantial 90% to R692m.\n\nAs at January 31, 2025, the SA and Botswana group was in a net cash position of R106m. PPC Zimbabwe continues to remain debt-free and held $13m in unencumbered cash at January 31.\n\nPPC Zimbabwe also increased its free cash flowgeneration leading to an increase in dividends declared and paid of $13m compared to the $11m paid in the comparable period.\n\nOverall sales volumes in the South Africa and Botswana group fell 1%. The decline was from lower Botswana sales volumes, since sales volumes in South Africa were flat. Price increases were implemented in July and offset the decline in volumes with revenue increasing by 2%.\n\nSouth Africa and Botswana group EBITDA increased 32%, resulting in margin expansion to 14.8% from 11.4%. This was also an increase from the margin of 13.7% at the half year.\n\nWhile most of the operational improvements are yet to materialise, the margin increase reflects the early delivery of a reduction in general and administrative expenses, and a contribution margin increase.\n\nThe materials business, comprising three businesses: ready mix concrete, aggregates and fly ash, saw EBITDA improve significantly.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, volumes fell 9%, consistent with the half-year. This trend started improving in January. Revenue fell 12% in rand terms, due to the rand strengthening in the current period compared to the comparable period.\n\nThe integrated cement plant in the Western Cape that was planned to secure PPCs cost competitiveness and low carbon cement leadership, was in the final stage ahead of seeking board approval.\n\nThe improvement of the results in the current period already reflects early delivery of the turnaround plan, ahead of the previously advised timeline, the board said, adding it would consider a dividend for the year.\n\n",

We lost equipment. It was a disaster, Dr Samuel Muhindo, in charge of a clinic in Goma, told the BBC.\n\nMpox  formerly known as monkeypox  can cause symptoms such as lesions, headaches and fever.\n\nAccording to Africa CDC, since the start of this year almost 2,890 mpox cases and 180 deaths have been reported in the country, which has been at the epicentre of several recent outbreaks.\n\nDr Muhindo described how 128 patients had fled Gomas Mugunga health centre in the wake of the fighting at the end of January.\n\nHis health workers had not been able to trace them as paperwork at the clinic was destroyed, he said.\n\nAt Bisengimana, a hospital in Goma that also treats mpox, looters took medicines and personal protective equipment.\n\nFires were lit outside the centre and when the perpetrators departed, patients medical records were left strewn on the floor.\n\nNow we are afraid of an outbreak of the epidemic in the areas where the displaced people returned to Dr Samuel Muhindo Head of the Mugunga health facility in Goma\n\nThey were given72 hours to leave last week, although the M23 later said it was encouraging voluntary returns.\n\nNow we are afraid of an outbreak of the epidemic in the areas where the displaced people returned to, Dr Muhindo said.\n\nHis fears have been echoed by the Africa CDC.\n\nOnce again, we are calling really for the ceasefire and also the agency to establish a humanitarian corridor to facilitate the continuation of mpox interventions, Dr Ngashi Ngongo, Africa CDCs mpox incident manager, said on Thursday.\n\nBisengimana health workers Looters made away with iron sheets, medicine, gloves and masks at Bisengimana hospital as fires were lit outside the facility\n\nOver the last week, the Africa CDC says the number of missing mpox patients has risen by 100 as fighting escalates and the rebels take more territory.\n\nDr Ngongo added that a new variant of mpox with high potential for higher transmissibility had also been detected in DR Congo.\n\nThe countrys ability to respond to the disease has been hampered by the conflict, between the M23 and DR Congos army, as well as a lack of funding.\n\nThe mpox facility at Mugunga, funded by the UN childrens agency (Unicef) and BrItish government aid, managed to reopen last week.\n\nBut it is already so overstretched that there are times when four or five patients have to share one bed.\n\nSadiki Bichichi Aristide arrived at the Mugunga clinic a week ago after falling sick at camp for people displaced by the fighting\n\nI first fled from Minova to Goma when the M23 rebels began to advance from there, Sadiki Bichichi Aristide, a 23-year-old being treated at Mugunga along with two of his children, told the BBC.\n\nI began to fall sick in a [camp for displaced people]. It started with my fingers, and then I had lesions, which began to rupture on my hands. My neighbours told me to go to Mugunga with my children. I left my wife behind.\n\nHe said he had seen so many people with mpox before he arrived at the clinic last week.\n\nDr Oummani Rouafi, Unicefs Goma health specialist, told the BBC that the only reason Mugunga hospital had reopened was because staff had managed to hide some equipment and medicine from the looters.\n\nBut this had not been the case at many other treatment centres that had been completely ransacked, he said.\n\n",

The trial was scheduled to start at 1000 hours but Chimombe was in a show for the second time.\n\nLast week, the trial could not commence after the court was notified that Chimombe was sick and needed seven days to recuperate.\n\nKwenda had no kind words for the ZPCSand both parties after he only learnt that Chimombe was not in attendance after the court sat.\n\nFive months later, the trial has beenpostponedseveral timeson various grounds.\n\nProfessor Lovemore Madhuku, taking instructions from Ashiel Mugiya, who is representing Chimombe, asked for a postponement.\n\nMadhuku also placed the blame on the State for not letting the court know Chimombes whereabouts.\n\nHe has been unwell since last week. This matter was postponed last week in the hope that he will be able to stand trial but we are informed that he is still unwell and was advised to further rest starting from the 28th.\n\nMadhuku said he was relying on information he was told by Mpofu as well as Chimombes relatives.\n\nKwenda then ordered the prisons officer who was in charge at the High Court to bring Chimombe to court at 1400 hours or come before the court with a detailed formal report on why he cannot attend court.\n\nPCO Chikoto was grilled for failing to bring Chimombe and failing to update the state and defence on what was unfolding.\n\nDo I have to remind you that it is your responsibility to bring the accused to the court? This is your statutory obligation. Thats why you exist, fumed Kwenda, further asking the officer his suggestions on the way forward.\n\nChikoto said, Maybe the court should request him to appear.\n\nKwenda hit back. As court, we dont request prisons to bring an accused to court. Its an order, and I expected to see the accused in court as was ordered last week.\n\nChikoto suggested that Chimombe could appear this Tuesday.\n\nHowever, Kwenda said he will not tolerate that.\n\nIt is not up to you to keep him at prison if he is needed at court. You listen to court orders. He should be here at 2 pm; if not then you will explain, ordered the judge.\n\nMadhuku then informed Kwenda that his client and Mpofu had an appeal being heard at the Supreme court at the same time.\n\nThe prominent lawyer also explained that at law, two courts cannot sit to hear matters involving the same people at the same time.\n\nKwenda said he could not rescind his ruling.\n\nMadhuku insisted that the judge should reverse its ruling because it was handed down while he was not aware of the case being heard at the upper court.\n\nIf the courts want to see him for something else, he can be her, but if it is for trial ,he has to be represented in accordance with the law.again thats not allowed; this court can only sit with the accused as a trial court and nothing other than that.\n\nI think you have a room to correct your order, my Lord, Madhuku said, adding that all lawyers in the matter will be arguing their clients cases at the Supreme Court; as such, no one will be available at the High Court.\n\nKwenda said his court will sit even if the lawyers do not show up.\n\nIf you want to be at the Supreme Court, the court will sit and deal with the matter. Note that the court is always fair and aware of his rights to legal representation.\n\nHe also blamed the state and the lawyers for failing to inform him about Chimombes absence in advance.\n\nThe judge also expressed his disappointment on how the trial commencement has failed to start for five months, also suggesting that parties should consider if the case should still be live-streamed.\n\nWitnesses were also dewarned because of the uncertainty.\n\nThe judge said they should stay within the courts jurisdiction in case they will be called at short notice.\n\nThe ZPCS later brought Chimombe to court.\n\nHe looked sick and slept in the dock as the judge asked him how to proceed.\n\nI have nothing to say. Had already given my lawyer instructions, he responded.\n\nThe matter was then postponed to March 17 for trial commencement.\n\n",

            "content": "By MoneyWeb\n\nThe Zimbabwe Exemption Permit Holders Association (Zepha) has asked the Zimbabwean government for help in expediting an urgent programme of voluntary return in light of the increasingly intolerable conditions for many of its members living in SA.\n\nZimbabweans are now forced to litigate when they go to the hospital, schools, universities, travel on the roads, and at the work place, says a memo sent by Zepha to the Zimbabwean ambassador to SA.\n\nZepha adds that it has already launched a repatriation programme, but would like the Zimbabwean governments help in assisting with the relocation of thousands of ZEP holders in finding accommodation and business opportunities, and to assist in lowering regulatory barriers to smooth their return.\n\nMany South Africans believe that Zimbabweans are hapless Zanu-PF victims useful only for their highly sought-after cheap, efficient, and trustworthy labour, reads the memo.\n\nTheir assistance for Zimbabwean staff extends only to prolonging exploitation, but not to provide Zimbabweans with the rights required to live full and dignified lives. In my view, they have no interest in the stability of Zimbabweans in South Africa, and the generations that will follow.\n\nThe majority black population in South Africa blames Zimbabweans for taking jobs, homes, medical services and economic opportunities, it says, adding that vigilant groups have been organised to harm, rob and even kill Zimbabweans, yet there has been no prosecution of the perpetrators.\n\nPhysically targeted\n\nXenophobia has been mainstreamed by political parties such as the Patriotic Alliance, MK Party and ActionSA, it adds, while quasi-militias operating as Operation Dudula and Put South Africa First have physically targeted foreigners, but more specifically Zimbabweans.\n\nThese attacks appear orchestrated and intensify during elections and national crises such as Covid and load shedding, it says.\n\nThe white minority blames Zanu-PF for ruining the Zimbabwean economy and forcing its citizens to flee to SA to avoid poverty, political persecution and maladministration, it adds.\n\nThe mainstream media, which they control, have successfully sold the South African population the idea that Zimbabwe is a failed state, which will never recover without them, and that it stands as an example of what could happen to South Africa if their interests are not protected, the memo adds.\n\nThe abuse of Zimbabweans in South Africa has caused significant psychological and emotional harm to all Zimbabweans in South Africa.\n\nIt is a matter that, in the view of many medical doctors and academics, cannot continue.\n\nThe memo also says Zimbabwean children in SA are being raised and conditioned to believe that they are second-class citizens. This is because their parents are humiliated, degraded, mistreated, and publicly scorned by what appears to be state-sponsored anti-Zimbabwe rhetoric.\n\nDiscrimination\n\nThe memo goes on to detail specific instances of discrimination that it claims have been happening, including:\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs (DHA) is accused of frustrating the rights of ZEP holders to apply for permanent residence, as allowed under the Immigration Act, even though they have lived, worked and paid taxes in SA for decades.\n\nThe DHAs decision to terminate the ZEP programme was found to be unlawful and unconstitutional in 2023 by the Gauteng High Court, which ordered the government to conduct public participation with the ZEP community.\n\nThe ZEP programme was then extended to the end of 2025, a deadline many of those applying forpermanent residence are unlikely to meet, argues Zepha.\n\nZEP holders are required to make online appointments with the visa processing company VFS, but many have received no appointment after four or more months of waiting.\n\nThis means their applications will not be processed before the expiry of the programme at the end of the year.\n\nNobody can reach their full potential in a toxic environment that is the reality for Zimbabweans in South Africa,concludes the Zepha appeal to the Zimbabwean ambassador.\n\nHistory has taught us that the return of significant numbers of the diaspora back to their country of origin, in various jurisdictions at various times, has led to economic development, transfer of skills, diversity of industry, and national pride.\n\n",

            "content": "By BBC\n\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has announced a four-point plan to work with Ukraine to end the war and defend the country from Russia.\n\nThe UK, France and other countries will step up their efforts in a coalition of the willing and seek to involve the US in their support for Ukraine, he said.\n\nWe are at a crossroads in history today, Starmer said after a summit of 18 leaders  mostly from Europe and including Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who said Ukraine felt strong support and the summit showed European unity at an extremely high level not seen for a long time.\n\nIt comes two days after a fiery exchange between the Ukrainian leader and US President Donald Trump in the White House.\n\nWe are all working together in Europe in order to find a basis for cooperation with America for a true peace and guaranteed security, Zelensky said after the summit.\n\nSpeaking at a news conference shortly after the meeting of leaders, Starmer said four points had been agreed: to keep military aid flowing into Ukraine, and to keep increasing the economic pressure on Russia, that any lasting peace must ensure Ukraines sovereignty and security and Ukraine must be present at any peace talks, and in the event of a peace deal, to boost Ukraines defensive capabilities to deter any future invasion. It also talks of developing a coalition of the willing to defend a deal in Ukraine and to guarantee peace afterwards.\n\nSir Keir also announced an additional 1.6bn ($2bn) of UK export finance to buy more than 5,000 air defence missiles. This comes on top of a 2.2bn loan to provide more military aid to Ukraine backed by profits from frozen Russian assets.\n\nWe have to learn from the mistakes of the past, we cannot accept a weak deal which Russia can breach with ease, instead any deal must be backed by strength, he said.\n\nThe prime minister did not state which countries had agreed to join this coalition of the willing, but said that those who had committed would intensify planning with real urgency.\n\nThe UK, he said, would back its commitment with boots on the ground, and planes in the air.\n\nEurope must do the heavy lifting, he said, before adding that the agreement would need US backing and had to include Russia, but that Moscow could not be allowed to dictate terms.\n\nLet me be clear, we agree with Trump on the urgent need for a durable peace. Now we need to deliver together, Sir Keir said.\n\nWhen asked if the US under Trump was an unreliable ally, he said: Nobody wanted to see what happened last Friday, but I do not accept that the US is an unreliable ally.\n\nCountries at the summit included France, Poland, Sweden, Turkey, Norway, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Romania, Finland, Italy, Spain and Canada.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that there was now an urgent need to re-arm Europe.\n\nThese sentiments were echoed by Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte, who said the meeting had seen European countries stepping up to make sure Ukraine has what it needs to stay in the fight as long as it has to continue.\n\nfter the summit, Zelensky went to Sandringham where he met King Charles III. He later spoke to reporters at a final press briefing where he said he was ready to sign a deal on minerals with the US.\n\nUkraine was expected to sign the deal  which would grant the US access to Ukraines rare mineral reserves  during Zelenskys visit to Washington, but the Ukrainian delegation ultimately left early after a heated confrontation with Trump in the Oval Office.\n\nEarlier on Sunday, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent warned a deal on minerals between the US and Ukraine could not be signed without a peace deal with Russia.\n\nBut when asked by the BBC about the future of the deal following the summit, Zelensky said it was ready to be signed.\n\nThe agreement thats on the table will be signed if the parties are ready, he said.\n\nSundays summit concludes a hectic week of diplomacy, which included visits to Washington by French President Emmanuel Macron, Sir Keir and Zelensky.\n\nZelenskys meeting, however, culminated in a heated exchanged with Trump and US Vice-President JD Vance, in which the US president accused his Ukrainian counterpart of gambling with World War Three.\n\nTrump has said he wants to end the war in Ukraine and has expressed trust in Russian President Vladimir Putin, to the consternation of many of his Western allies.\n\nThe US has also begun peace talks with Russia  excluding Ukraine.\n\nAt one point, the US leader accused Ukraine of starting the war  even though it was Putin who launched a full-scale invasion of Russias neighbour on 24 February 2022.\n\n",
