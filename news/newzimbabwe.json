Ministry of Tourism and Hospitality Industry, Ministry of Local Government and Public Works were nowhere to be seen, same as the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage. We want to encourage the Government of Zimbabwe to support such traditional and cultural heritage events, said Molokela.\n\nThe Government is at odds with the Ndebele King, Bulelani Khumalo, a descendant of Mzilikazi, refusing to recognise his kingship.\n\nMolokela further said Mzilikazi Day should be honoured and celebrated by the country.\n\nThe event attracted participants from all over Zimbabwe and some from the diaspora, especially from South Africa. Thousands of people from different generations, elders, youths, children, women, men, rural people and urban people attended the event from different cultures and languages.\n\nZimbabwe prides itself in cultural heritage, it prides itself in national identity and also decolonisation in terms of identity. An event like the one which we held on Saturday is something that as Zimbabweans, we must celebrate and encourage all districts, provinces, cultures and all languages in Zimbabwe to organise such kind of events so that as a nation, we can also be recognised that we have gone beyond the colonial system, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "Metro UKs foreign correspondent Gergana Krasteva reports from Zimbabwe\n\nBeads of sweat drip down Gilbert Nuovus forehead as the memories of working inone of Zimbabwes gold minesrush back in.\n\nOver a year ago, the dad-of-two deserted his job after a colleague was killed when the walls of the pit caved in, burying him alive.\n\nA friend of mine died on the spot. I was afraid for my life, so I went back home, he tellsMetro.\n\nThe road into Matabeleland North, 150 miles from the city of Bulawayo, is uneven and thick with dust, but I am assured that it will eventually lead to a gold mine.\n\nIt is one of the many precious materials for which the land here has been exploited since before British colonial rule, with the first extractions made as early as the 14th century.\n\nAs our SUV crawls forward, a line of workers stretches along the footpath  boys barely into their teens and weathered men three times their age.\n\nMost are wearing the same faded blue overalls, and chipped shovels slung over their shoulders  a sign theyworkin one of the legal mines.\n\nMatabeleland North sits on some of the richest deposits of gold in Africa, and so is plagued with artisanal pits, which are not officially registered with thegovernment, making them illegal.\n\nYet, tens of thousands of men and women are forced into the trade due to unemployment, making up the majority of the mining workforce.\n\nGordon Sibanda used to be one of them.\n\nMetrospeaks with him at the Libeni PrimarySchool, where he volunteers as a chef to somehow contribute to the local community while searching for work.\n\nSitting on a wooden log and smoothing his cooking apron, he admits that poverty is what drove him to mining in 2001, when he was 39.\n\nHe says: A friend introduced me to the trade. Many of my friends are still in the pits to this day.\n\nMining is strenuous labor. You can spend months searching for a mineral you cannot see and do not know if it is actually in the earth.\n\nAnd when luck would fall on our side, you may get something.\n\nIn Zimbabwes mines, death never seems far.\n\nSo when I ask Gordon if any of his colleagues were injured or killed in the pits, he replies, almost nonchalantly, as he takes off his woolen beanie: Ah yes. Three have been killed when the mines collapsed.\n\nDisintegrated shafts, explosions, flooding  each shift carries the chance that a worker will not return home.\n\nAs many as 237 people died in incidents in 2023, making it one of the very worst years in the countrys mining history.\n\nAnd up until May this year, 59 fatal incidents were reported  most in illegal mines, like the one that Gordon worked in.\n\nTo fully comprehend the vast scale of illegal mining,Metrosits down with Pumulu Masu, government school inspector, who says that most people in Matabeleland North dig without a permit, which means the state does not profit from it.\n\nMostly, people in the area mine illegally, she explains. Lets say there is an agricultural field. Instead of a farm, they will turn it into a mine.\n\nEven in their personal properties  behind their homes  people start to dig.\n\nWe can always tell by the maps of soil. If people suspect there is gold, they will always dig no matter what the land is.\n\nWhile Gordon worked in an illegal pit, Gilbert has experience in a registered mine.\n\nTheir only piece of advice  what they want everyone to know  is do not do it, do not work in a mine, pointing to how deadly the trade is.\n\nGilbert says: The pit is not that strong as miners often dig tunnels [without much planning], making the walls weak.\n\nWe are not given helmets or boots to protect us. It is difficult to survive.\n\nThe work is just too much. In mines, there are no set working hours.You work and you stop when it is time to eat, then you go back to work. It is continuous, we do not stop.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, mining runs through generations like a vein of gold itself. It is often seen as a rite of passage for children as young as nine, and at the same time a lifeline for families in the depths of poverty.\n\nThough the pay is still meagre. All the money Gordon earned was spent on food for his large family, all 13 of them.\n\nAt the time, he was the sole breadwinner for his wife, three sons and three daughters, his own parents and siblings.\n\nHand to mouth, nothing else [is left], he adds, gesturing at his grandson, a four-year-old boy playing with his friends a few metres away.\n\nYet, despite facing unemployment, Gordon has not given mining another thought because of the precarious conditions.\n\nLike him, Gilbert also did not live a life of luxury  but he was under no such illusions when he picked up a shovel.\n\nAfter three months of digging, he was paid around $20, and only after gold was actually discovered. Miners divvy up half the proceeds, while the rest goes straight to the owners pocket.\n\nThere are other dangers too.\n\nThe industry has long been linked to human rights abuses, environmental violations and labour exploitation, particularly in lithium mines operated byChina, despite denials by Zimbabwes government. About 70% of all lithium is processed there.\n\nRobert Mugabes successor, president Emmerson Mnangagwa, of ZANU-PF, has so far supported the takeovers, arguing they will bring economic growth.\n\nPerhaps this has materialised in the capital, Harare; yet, on the ground, in Matabeleland North, the mines have brought little benefits  if any  to the local community.\n\nMetrogained access to Turk, one of the oldest gold mines in Zimbabwe, located in the Bubbi District.\n\nArmed security usually guard gold mines, but today luck has fallen on our side  at least for a few minutes.\n\nPiles of reddish earth and stones mount inside the compound. A dragline excavator in the distance seems to have dosed off, but only momentarily.\n\nThe mine itself gapes before us, an abyss carved so deep and wide that, when peering over the edge, the bottom is not visible.\n\nAcross the road from the pit, a supermarket and two bars stand shoulder to shoulder, their doors flung wide open. A few men have gathered around a plastic table, kicking dust with their feet as they chat.\n\nThis is the heart of what is accepted as the traditional mining community in Zimbabwe.\n\nThere are no clinics or schools, or in fact any other reliable infrastructure apart from the mine.\n\nBars are always the first to spring up whenever gold is unearthed, offering miners a place to unwind and spend their hard-earned cash in.\n\nAs I come to learn, this has also led to alcohol abuse among workers who use drinking as a coping mechanism.\n\nA source, who wished to remain anonymous, tellsMetro: You cannot put a figure on how many people have died because of it. Some have been found dead on pavements.\n\nWorkers deaths are often blamed on the rise in popularity of an illicit brew called krango, which can cause severe organ damage, and is associated with soaring rates of binge drinking.\n\nMy source explains that it is mostly made from ethanol concentrate diluted with large amounts of water, adding: Krango is what it is all about in rural areas. It is packed in bottles of 250ml.\n\nSanctions on Zimbabwe were first introduced in the early 2000s, mainly by the UK, the EU, and the US, amid allegations of human rights abuses, electoral fraud, and Robert Mugabes land reform programme.\n\nThese measures are not broad trade embargoes. They focus on asset freezes and travel bans on senior government officials linked to the state.\n\nThe US also brought out the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act (ZDERA) in 2001, which restricted its access to international financial institutions.\n\nWhile the sanctions target political elites, the Zimbabwean government argues they have deterred foreign investment and limited lines of credit  so much so that the now vice president Constantino Chiwenga said the country had lost more than $150 billion.\n\nSome are even packed by legitimate companies. It is sold for just $0.50, and the strength is usually around 40% strength.\n\nDespite the reported issues plaguing Zimbabwes mines, the government is hellbent on expanding the industry  the faster, the better.\n\nFor a nation that fought so hard to rid itself from colonial rule, it now relies on investors from China, South Africa, Australia, Canada and the UK, and it is eager to attract more.\n\nThe sector as a whole accounts for more than 60% of export revenues and 13% of gross domestic product (GDP), according to national statistics from 2023.\n\nTo increase those numbers, the Zimbabwean government introduced the Vision 2030 plan to become an upper-middle-income economy by the end of the decade.\n\nSupposedly, one of the key objectives is to grow the mining sector to have a revenue of $12 billion per year.\n\nIt makes money, that is for sure, though not for the small miner like Gordon or Gilbert.\n\nThey are currently unemployed and living with the memories of the hell inside the mines.\n\n",

It is the first time that Polish and NATO forces have become engaged in the conflict. Ukraine said Russia is testing the West.\n\nDuring todays attack by the Russian Federation on targets in Ukraine, our airspace was repeatedly violated by drones, the Operational Command of the Polish military said in a statement.\n\nAt the request of the Operational Commander of the Armed Forces, weapons have been used, and operations are under way to locate the downed targets, the military said.\n\nThe army said Polish and NATO military aircraft were mobilised to ensure airspace safety.\n\nPolish and allied aircraft are operating in our airspace, while ground-based air defence and radar reconnaissance systems have been brought to the highest state of readiness, the Operational Command said.\n\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed that an operation is under way related to multiple violations of Polish airspace.\n\nTrwa operacja zwizana z wielokrotnym naruszeniem polskiej przestrzeni powietrznej. Przeciwko obiektom wojsko uyo uzbrojenia. Jestem w staym kontakcie z Prezydentem i Ministrem Obrony. Odebraem bezporedni meldunek od dowdcy operacyjnego.\n\n Donald Tusk (@donaldtusk)September 10, 2025\n\nTranslation: An operation is under way related to multiple violations of Polish airspace. The military used armaments against the objects. I am in constant contact with the president and the minister of defence. I received a direct report from the operational commander.\n\nAn operation was also conducted to collect debris from the drones.\n\nA drone or similar object struck a residential building in Wyryki in eastern Poland, but nobody was injured, its mayor told the state-run news channel TVP Info. Footage showed a house with a damaged roof and the rafters showing.\n\nPolice in the Lublin region said they found a damaged drone in the village of Czosnowka while drone debris was also reported in the town of Czesniki.\n\nTusk confirmed that the drones originated from Russia. We are dealing with a large-scale provocation, the prime minister said.\n\nMoscow appeared to distance itself from the incident. The Russian Ministry of Defence said its drones had struck military facilities in western Ukraine but there were no plans to target sites in Poland.\n\nEarlier, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the European Union and NATO accuse Russia of provocations on a daily basis, most of the time without even trying to present at least some kind of argument.\n\nTusk said he was in constant contact with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. An emergency meeting of the Polish Council of Ministers was called for Wednesday.\n\nAircraft have used weapons against hostile objects, Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on social media, adding: We are in constant contact with NATO command.\n\nUkraines foreign minister said on Wednesday that the events show Russian President Vladimir Putins impunity and his expansion of the war and added that Moscow is testing the Wests willingness to respond to aggression.\n\nPutin just keeps escalating, expanding his war, and testing the West, Andrii Sybiha said on X.\n\nThis situation shows that finally the decision needs to be taken to enable partner air defence capabilities in neighbouring countries to be used to intercept drones and missiles in the Ukrainian airspace, including those approaching NATO borders.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy said eight Russian drones had been aimed toward Poland, and called the episode an extremely dangerous precedent for Europe.\n\nEU Defence Commissioner Andrius Kubilius called for the EU to develop a drone wall along its eastern flank.\n\nOnce again Russia tests frontier states, EU & NATO, Kubilius wrote in a post on social media. We shall work together with Member States, frontier countries and Ukraine. Russia will be stopped.\n\nRussias war is escalating, not ending. We must raise the cost on Moscow, strengthen support for Ukraine, and invest in Europes defence. The EU plays a major role and we will support initiatives like the Eastern Border Shield defence line, the EUs top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, wrote on social media.\n\nThe United States also questioned Moscows intentions after the incident with President Donald Trump weighing in on Truth Social: Whats with Russia violating Polands airspace with drones? Here we go!\n\nFour airports in Poland, including Chopin Airport in Warsaw, were closed due to military activity late on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to notices posted on the US Federal Aviation Administrations website, the other airports closed were Rzeszow-Jasionka Airport, Warsaw Modlin Airport and Lublin Airport.\n\nChopin Airport confirmed later in a post on social media that airspace over parts of Poland, including over the airport, had been closed temporarily due to the actions of state services and the military to ensure safety.\n\nPassengers whose travel plans were disrupted were asked to monitor airlines and official government announcements for updates.\n\nEarly on Wednesday, all of the airports save for Lublin, which is close to the border with Ukraine, reopened.\n\nWany komunikat dla pasaerw korzystajcych z@ChopinAirport.pic.twitter.com/kN1W7dFSLx\n\n Chopin Airport, WAW (@ChopinAirport)September 10, 2025\n\nThe military mobilisation in Poland came after Ukraines air force reported that Russian drones had entered Polish airspace, posing a threat to the city of Zamosc, but the air force later removed the statement from its Telegram messaging app.\n\nMost of Ukraine, including the western regions of Volyn and Lviv, which border Poland, were under air raid alerts for several hours overnight, according to Ukraines air force data.\n\nPoland said earlier that it planned to close its border with Belarus at midnight on Thursday (22:00 GMT on Wednesday) due to Russian-led military exercises scheduled to take place in Belarus.\n\nRussia and Belaruss large-scale military exercises, known as the Zapad drills, have raised security concerns in neighbouring Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, all NATO member states. The Zapad-2025 (West-2025) drills will be held in western Russia and Belarus from Friday.\n\nAsked about the duration of the border closure, Polish Minister of Interior Marcin Kierwinski said the border would only be reopened when the government was sure there was no more threat to Polish citizens.\n\nThe Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had summoned the Polish charge daffaires to complain about the border closure, which it said caused significant difficulties.\n\nIt described Polands move as an abuse of its geographical position.\n\nThe temporary suspension of passage indicates rather an intention to conceal ones own actions than the existence of any threat from Belarus, the Foreign Ministry said.\n\nLithuanias border guard said on Tuesday that the protection of its border with Belarus and Russia would be strengthened due to the exercises.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA Magunje family was left shattered after their 20-year-old son murdered his own sister in cold blood, then lost his sight on the eve of his trial.\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Philda Muzofa, sitting with assessors in Chinhoyi, convicted Isaac Mashonga, now 28, of brutally killing his sister, Dadirai Mashonga, in their kitchen hut in Mashonga Village, Zvipani, Magunje, in July 2017.\n\nThe horror began when their 93-year-old father, Champion Mashonga, and his wife woke up to find their daughters headless body sprawled in blood.\n\nNo parent can imagine one of his or her children beheading his sibling in their kitchen, Muzofa said while delivering her judgment, calling it a tragedy that will haunt this family and community forever.\n\nOn the night of July 13, 2017, Isaac, then 20, arrived at his parents home in the company of a local businessman known as Giant, real name Robert Tichareva.\n\nThe businessman was arrested together with Mashonga, but has since passed on.\n\nProsecutors told the court the two had conspired to kill Dadirai for ritual purposes, with Isaac allegedly promised US$4,000 for the beheading.\n\nThat night, Dadirai was fast asleep in the kitchen hut.\n\nVillagers later testified that Isaac led Robert straight to her room.\n\nInside, she was strangled and then decapitated using a kitchen knife, axe and adze.\n\nThe pair stuffed the head into a green satchel and smuggled it out to a derelict building near the business centre.\n\nThe following morning, Isaac returned to the homestead wearing blood-soaked clothes.\n\nVillagers who gathered at the gruesome scene apprehended him, tied his hands, and later forced him to lead them to the hidden satchel. Inside was Dadirais head.\n\nHe confessed and showed us the weapons, testified his father, Champion. As a father, I had no reason to misrepresent the facts. I was simply a troubled father.\n\nAs if the ordeal was not enough, Isaac lost his sight while awaiting trial.\n\nPrison doctors confirmed he is now 80% blind, a development that deepened his elderly parents pain.\n\nFor this elderly couple, they have lost two children at the same time  one through death and one through incarceration, the judge noted.\n\nInside prison, Isaacs blindness has left him dependent on fellow inmates for food, bathing and movement. Being blind and in prison presents a double challenge, the court acknowledged, though ruling that disability could not shield him from punishment.\n\nIsaac had claimed he was drugged by Robert and acted under the businessmans instructions. But Justice Muzofa dismissed his story as far-fetched and chicanery.\n\nThe accused literally took the Court for granted, the judge said. He carried the satchel fully aware that it had his sisters head. He then went to sleep. How can a person conduct himself likewise and yet claim he was intoxicated?\n\nThe court found that Isaac acted as a willing accomplice. The proved facts admit of no other inference except that the accused was part of this grand plan, Justice Muzofa ruled.\n\nThe judge said the killing had induced a sense of shock and revulsion in the community and branded it murder in aggravating circumstances.\n\nAlthough Isaacs youth, six years in pre-trial custody and his disability were considered, the court said retribution and deterrence must prevail.\n\nHe now faces decades behind bars,blind, broken, and carrying the weight of a family curse: the brother who killed his sister and destroyed his parents twilight years.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nZimbabwe is stepping up efforts to expand beef exports to Asian markets, with authorities intensifying surveillance of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) to safeguard herd health and meet international standards.\n\nOnce a major beef exporter in the late 1980s, Zimbabwes livestock sector suffered a sharp decline at the turn of the millennium due to the Fast-Track Land Reform Programme, which disrupted large-scale commercial ranching. This, combined with repeated disease outbreaks such as FMD, led to shrinking herd sizes and the loss of lucrative export markets.\n\nIn recent years, however, the sector has shown significant potential to recover through private and government-led initiatives aimed at boosting productivity, improving quality, and opening new markets.\n\nDeputy Lands and Agriculture Minister Vangelis Haritatos told Parliament that Zimbabwe is now working on expanding its beef export base to East Asia.\n\nGovernment is currently negotiating a bilateral Beef Export Trade Protocol with Asian countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia. The main challenge affecting exports has been foot-and-mouth disease control.\n\nTo this end, Government has intensified FMD surveillance and established disease-free zones for beef production, Haritatos said.\n\nHe added that the ministry has partnered with African Livestock and Organic Welfare (ALOW) and ZimTrade to ensure beef destined for export meets international quality standards.\n\nEast Asia represents a vast market for beef imports, driven by rising demand from its growing middle class. China remains one of the worlds largest consumers, while Japan and South Korea are also among the regions top importers.\n\n",
