The work shifts start at 5am up to 7pm in the evening.\n\nWe receive between US$7,00 and US$8,00 per day. The owners of the company are reluctant to give us contracts and if you question them they respond by beating up the workers, the employee alleged.\n\nAnother employee (name withheld) who spoke to our news crew alleged that at one point he was beaten up until he later lost his tooth\n\nOn night shifts we are given just one hour to eat and rest. If you wake up late, say about just five minutes later, US$20,00 is deducted from your earnings, he said.\n\nAnother former employee alleged that when he was summarily fired a few months ago, efforts to recover his outstanding dues were foiled after the Chinese company owners unleashed dogs.\n\nQuizzed on why the recently dismissed worker had not filed a report with the police, he said, When I went to the police station in Msasa, which is close to the company, the officers told me they could not open a docket if I did not provide fuel for them to go and investigate the matter.\n\nAfter all, reporting to the police in the area is just an exercise in futility because the guys just bribe their way out.\n\nEfforts by NewZimbabwe.com to contact the company were fruitless since there was no readily available website or social media handles on the company.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) has arrested Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC)s Makoni Central legislator, Patrick Sagandira.\n\nThe Member of Parliament for Makoni Central constituency, which encompasses Rusape in Manicaland province, was nabbed Friday on allegations of unlawfully occupying and developing State land, in violation of Section 63 of the Land Commission Act [Chapter 20:04].\n\nSagandira is alleged to have illegally allocated himself a 300-square-meter stand of State land in 2023 without a lease or permit from the Rusape Town Council.\n\nThe piece of land, according to the Rusape Town Council plan, was reserved as a space for parking and landscaping but the lawmaker developed structures housing his grinding mill business.\n\nThe MP also allegedly leased parts of the illegal structures to two individuals running a furniture shop and a brick-moulding business.\n\nCouncil reportedly engaged Sagandira and ordered him to demolish the structures in line with Section 32 of the Regional and Town Planning Act [Chapter 29:12], but he allegedly ignored the order, continuing his operations and subletting the premises.\n\nSubsequently, a report was made to ZACC leading to the MPs arrest.\n\nHe is set to appear at Mutare Magistrates Court for initial remand today, June 21, 2025.\n\n",
