            "content": "By BBC News\n\nA FORMER girlfriend of Sean Diddy Combs, testifying for a second day at his criminal trial under the pseudonym Jane, described how she felt pressured to engage in sexual encounters with male escorts while he watched, despite her expressing they upset her.\n\nShe also alleged a network of employees helped procure drugs for the lengthy encounters, known as hotel nights or freak-offs, that left her in pain and with frequent infections.Prosecutors have charged Mr Combs, 55, with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution.He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.At the beginning of the trial, now in its fifth week, defence attorney Teny Geragos said the government had overstepped with its charges and are trying to portray consensual sex between adults as evidence of crimes.With Janes testimony, prosecutors are seeking to provide evidence that the music moguls activities were criminal.In one hotel night encounter in New York in 2023, Jane testified that she invited a male sex worker to fly from Atlanta, Georgia, to New York City to join her and Mr Combs for an encounter at the Trump International Hotel.Jane paid for his ticket, she testified, and afterward, she worked to ensure that an envelope containing several thousand dollars was left for the escort at the front desk.On another occasion, the woman testified that Mr Combss chief of staff Kristina Khorram allegedly instructed her to pick up drugs from Los Angeles to bring to Mr Combs Miami mansion.Ms Khorram has been named by prosecutors in court as a co-conspirator to Mr Combs, and could potentially testify.Sean Diddy Combs: Who is the US rapper accused of sex trafficking?Jane told the court that she picked the package up from a member of Mr Combs security, put it in her check-in luggage and flew to Miami, where she discovered it contained ecstasy.She also said she often saw Mr Combs call his assistants and security to bring drugs to the hotels where they had their encounters with escorts.One of the charges Mr Combs faces is racketeering. In order to prove that, prosecutors have to show that he was running a criminal enterprise and conspiring to commit crimes.Jane testifies about a financial love contractBy the time of the 2023 New York encounter, Jane said she realised she no longer wanted to participate in these hotel nights. The pair had been together since 2021.During the trip, the two began bickering about them and she told Mr Combs she was done with this, she said.Mr Combs was defensive, she said, but told her they didnt have to continue. Still, later that night, she joined him for one.Prosecutors asked the woman several times why she stayed in a relationship with Mr Combs, even as she described feeling disgusted, repulsed after one rare encounter where she did not take drugs, which she said she took to make them seem less real.A federal prosecutor asked why she arranged the hotel night in New York if she had just told Mr Combs she no longer wanted to participate.Jane paused for a long time, at first saying it was hard to answer. She wanted to make her partner happy, she said.Prosecutors introduced the pairs financial ties. At the time, Mr Combs was paying Janes $10,000 per month rent, which he continues to do to this day.Jane testified that the pair made a love contract in which Mr Combs agreed to give her a monthly $10,000 allowance for two years. The rapper would hold the money over her head if she resisted hotel nights, she testified.She said one week, she was planning an all-star party with male escorts from their previous encounters.Mr Combs said he was hyped, but Jane eventually tried to back out. Prosecutors showed the jury texts between the two, where Jane sent photos to prove she was not feeling well.Mr Combs responded with messages she interpreted as threats to cut her off financially.In 2024, near the end of their relationship, Mr Combs told her that he had not known the hotel night encounters upset her and that she had not told him.But in reviewing her messages and notes from their relationship, Jane said she realised she expressed her unhappiness.In one exchange, she told Mr Combs she was upset that he had spent time with another woman after only engaging in a hotel night with her.I need a breather and a break from you, she texted him in November 2021.This doesnt make me feel good at all, your intentions are in plain sight.She also testified on Friday that the hotel nights took a physical toll on her.She told the court that she frequently contracted infections, and felt pelvic pain 100% of the time following the encounters.Jane recalled she probably did not tell Mr Combs about these physical issues because I just didnt want to indicate any negativity, she said.Earlier in the trial, R&B singer Cassandra Cassie Ventura took the witness stand, describing similar drug-fuelled sex encounters with Mr Combs, who she dated for more than a decade.She will continue to face questioning next week, with Mr Combs defence attorneys likely to be grilling her extensively about her time with the rap mogul.\n\nShe also alleged a network of employees helped procure drugs for the lengthy encounters, known as hotel nights or freak-offs, that left her in pain and with frequent infections.\n\nProsecutors have charged Mr Combs, 55, with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution.He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.At the beginning of the trial, now in its fifth week, defence attorney Teny Geragos said the government had overstepped with its charges and are trying to portray consensual sex between adults as evidence of crimes.With Janes testimony, prosecutors are seeking to provide evidence that the music moguls activities were criminal.In one hotel night encounter in New York in 2023, Jane testified that she invited a male sex worker to fly from Atlanta, Georgia, to New York City to join her and Mr Combs for an encounter at the Trump International Hotel.Jane paid for his ticket, she testified, and afterward, she worked to ensure that an envelope containing several thousand dollars was left for the escort at the front desk.On another occasion, the woman testified that Mr Combss chief of staff Kristina Khorram allegedly instructed her to pick up drugs from Los Angeles to bring to Mr Combs Miami mansion.Ms Khorram has been named by prosecutors in court as a co-conspirator to Mr Combs, and could potentially testify.Sean Diddy Combs: Who is the US rapper accused of sex trafficking?Jane told the court that she picked the package up from a member of Mr Combs security, put it in her check-in luggage and flew to Miami, where she discovered it contained ecstasy.She also said she often saw Mr Combs call his assistants and security to bring drugs to the hotels where they had their encounters with escorts.One of the charges Mr Combs faces is racketeering.

            "content": "By Franny Rabkin l TimesLive\n\nTHE Supreme Court of Appeal has rejected an appeal by the minister of Home Affairs against the Johannesburg High Court order on Zimbabwe Exemption Permits (ZEPs), which give about 180,000 Zimbabweans a special dispensation to lawfully remain in South Africa.\n\nThe judgment also clears the path for the Zimbabwean Immigration Federation to return to court and argue that it is only Parliament, and not the Home Affairs minister, which can decide whether to extend the ZEP regime.In 2023, the Johannesburg High Court set aside a decision by former minister Aaron Motsoaledi to terminate the ZEP regime and to reconsider his decision, following a fair process.The SCAs judgment on Friday said that counsel for the minister told the court that the order is being implemented, and  the minister is following a fair process.But the federation wants to go back to court to argue that ZEP holders and their children enjoy constitutional rights in South Africa. If these are to be limited, only Parliament may do so  by enacting a law of general application, says the SCAs judgment.The SCA did not give a view on whether that argument was correct, but it rejected an appeal by the minister that would have prevented the federation from ever making it.When the High Court gave its order, the federation was one of the parties in the litigation, along with the Helen Suzman Foundation (HSF). Theirs were two separate cases, which were heard together.While the federation and the HSF both wanted similar orders, at that time, from the High Court, their grounds were different.

Judge of Appeal David Unterhalter said the federations case raised distinctive grounds of review, which laid the basis for an argument that was not raised or argued earlier  about the powers of the minister when there were constitutional rights at stake.If the federations argument was to be accepted, it would not permit the minister to terminate the ZEP regime.That is a remedial outcome of a considerably more far-reaching kind because it reaches into the future and is not based on a reconsideration, said Unterhalter.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe (MCAZ) and the Health Professions Authority (HPA) have cautioned the public against the illegal sale, purchase, and use of Ozempic, a prescription medication known as the skinny jab.\n\nThe Ozempic is originally designed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.In a joint statement, MCAZ Director-General Richard Rukwata said there is a surge in the illicit sale of Ozempic through unauthorised channels.He also noted that the public is now misusing the Ozempic for weight loss, prompting serious health concerns.Recent reports indicate an increase in the illicit use of Ozempic for weight loss purposes. However, its use for weight loss outside of medical supervision is potentially dangerous and could lead to serious harm to the user, said Rukwata.As a prescription medicine, Ozempic can only be accessed upon presentation of a valid prescription and should only be used under the strict supervision of a qualified and registered healthcare professional. Self-medicating with Ozempic for weight loss can have serious and potentially life-threatening consequences.We warn the public against purchasing Ozempic from unauthorized sources, including online marketplaces, social media platforms, unlicensed premises, or unregistered individuals.These sources often lack quality control and may offer substandard and/or falsified medications. The illegal sale and distribution of prescription medications is not only illegal but also poses a significant threat to public health.Illegal traders of Ozempic have been warned that selling the product is a criminal offence that attracts jail time.Selling medicines by unlicensed persons from unlicensed premises contravenes Sections 50 and 52 of the Medicines and Allied Substances Control (General) Regulations, 1991, SI 150 of 1991, as read with Section 106 of the same Regulations.Additionally, the sale of unregistered medicines is in contravention of Section 29(1)(a) of the Medicines and Allied Substances Control Act, as read with Section 29(la) of the same Act.The Health Professions Act (Chapter 27:19) Section 126 prohibits unqualified personnel from performing any act specifically pertaining to a registered profession. Therefore, diagnosis and prescribing should only be conducted by qualified and licensed personnel, reads the statement.Both the MCAZ and HPA urged the public to consult only registered health professionals for medical advice and treatment.Mandated to safeguard the public, HPA and MCAZ urge the public to seek medical advice and treatment only from registered health professionals and institutions.

However, its use for weight loss outside of medical supervision is potentially dangerous and could lead to serious harm to the user, said Rukwata.As a prescription medicine, Ozempic can only be accessed upon presentation of a valid prescription and should only be used under the strict supervision of a qualified and registered healthcare professional. Self-medicating with Ozempic for weight loss can have serious and potentially life-threatening consequences.We warn the public against purchasing Ozempic from unauthorized sources, including online marketplaces, social media platforms, unlicensed premises, or unregistered individuals.These sources often lack quality control and may offer substandard and/or falsified medications.

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nTHE Centre for Natural Resource Governance (CNRG) has blasted the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) for issuing permits to Save Valley Conservancy to kill 50 elephants, describing the move as misleading and unethical.\n\nZimParks earlier this week said the culling of 50 jumbos was to curb overpopulation, which exceeds the carrying capacity of Zimbabwes national parks.According to the 2024 aerial survey, there are 2,550 elephants against an ecological carrying capacity of 800 elephants in Save Valley Conservancy.In a statement, CNRG said the culling presented as an elephant management exercise, ignores scientific and humane alternatives, risks harming tourism, and may be driven by hidden commercial interests.While we acknowledge the ecological pressures within Save Valley Conservancy and the challenges posed by elephant overpopulation, we reject culling as a legitimate, ethical, or science-backed solution.Culling is a violent, short-term fix that disregards the complex social structures of elephant herds, risks traumatizing surviving animals, and ultimately fails to address the root causes of habitat stress and human-elephant conflict, CNRG said.Instead of killing, the environmental watchdog also argued that a broader national strategy focused on elephant range expansion, ecological corridors, and humane alternatives like contraception and community engagement is urgently needed.What is needed is a national strategy on elephant range expansion, ecological corridors, and increased investment in trans-boundary elephant conservation. Contraceptive methods, community engagement, and landscape restoration offer far more humane and sustainable options than state-sanctioned killing, CNRG added.The elephant meat from the management exercise will be distributed to local communities.CNRG believes the planned distribution of elephant meat to communities masks what may be a veiled effort to generate ivory stockpiles accusing the government of using conservation as a cover for exploiting wildlife for profit.We are also concerned that the proposed culls ultimately serve the interests of those who stand to benefit from the commercial exploitation of threatened wildlife populations.CNRG noted the militarised and extractive approach to wildlife governance that continues to exclude communities from decision-making will only escalate conflict and deepen mistrust.\n\nZimParks earlier this week said the culling of 50 jumbos was to curb overpopulation, which exceeds the carrying capacity of Zimbabwes national parks.\n\nAccording to the 2024 aerial survey, there are 2,550 elephants against an ecological carrying capacity of 800 elephants in Save Valley Conservancy.In a statement, CNRG said the culling presented as an elephant management exercise, ignores scientific and humane alternatives, risks harming tourism, and may be driven by hidden commercial interests.While we acknowledge the ecological pressures within Save Valley Conservancy and the challenges posed by elephant overpopulation, we reject culling as a legitimate, ethical, or science-backed solution.Culling is a violent, short-term fix that disregards the complex social structures of elephant herds, risks traumatizing surviving animals, and ultimately fails to address the root causes of habitat stress and human-elephant conflict, CNRG said.Instead of killing, the environmental watchdog also argued that a broader national strategy focused on elephant range expansion, ecological corridors, and humane alternatives like contraception and community engagement is urgently needed.What is needed is a national strategy on elephant range expansion, ecological corridors, and increased investment in trans-boundary elephant conservation.

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nGOVERNMENT contractors have been urged to stop abusing payment delays by the Treasury as an excuse to cause mayhem in the construction industry.\n\nRecently, the Zimbabwe Building Contractors Association (ZBCA) pressed the alarm button over delayed payments from Treasury saying the development is choking operations in the construction sector.However, responding to the problems raised by the contractors, the Zimbabwe Construction and Allied Trades Workers Union (ZCATWU) general secretary, Nicholas Mazarura Tuesday criticized the contractors for amplifying the payment delays to justify underformance in the construction industry.He said surprisingly, even some contractors, who are not involved in business with the government were now taking advantage of the failure to pay by the authorities.We would like to dispel some misconceptions arising from the issues put forward by the ZBCA. To set the record straight, ZCATWU confirms the challenges that were indicated by ZBCA to be affecting only a handful of employers. We note that the ZBCA seeks to blanket all players in the construction industry to be facing the same challenges, he said.That such dishonesty has the net effect of disturbing harmony in the industry as it has a huge bearing on collective bargaining.He revealed that for over a year now, the construction sector has been experiencing difficulties in negotiating salary and wages since such unscrupulous employers, including many without any business with government, had resorted to hiding behind the empty lies.Most of the times when we engage for negotiations the response we get is that the government is failing to pay the contractors, but we are aware that we do have some contractors who are not contracted by the government and they are just not paying or increasing wages citing late payments by the government, said Mazarura.ZCATWU contends that the industry has the capacity to pay decent wages and appealed to the contractors representatives to advise some employers, who are not contracted by the government to utilise their Works Council platforms to complement the National Employment Council (NEC) efforts.He castigated the sectors employers for leaving workers to reel under poverty conditions despite having the capacity to pay.We also have foreign companies operating their businesses and are not willing to increase wages based on government contracts.The industry is now riddled with several challenges as employers are now seeking to be exempted from paying gazette wages. They are now abusing Statutory Instrument 45 of 2013, which gives the right to employers and employees to waiver and is also very clear on the requirements of waiver, added Mazarura.\n\nRecently, the Zimbabwe Building Contractors Association (ZBCA) pressed the alarm button over delayed payments from Treasury saying the development is choking operations in the construction sector.\n\nHowever, responding to the problems raised by the contractors, the Zimbabwe Construction and Allied Trades Workers Union (ZCATWU) general secretary, Nicholas Mazarura Tuesday criticized the contractors for amplifying the payment delays to justify underformance in the construction industry.He said surprisingly, even some contractors, who are not involved in business with the government were now taking advantage of the failure to pay by the authorities.We would like to dispel some misconceptions arising from the issues put forward by the ZBCA.
