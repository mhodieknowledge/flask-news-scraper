            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nVice President Constantino Chiwenga has disclosed that he was the one who reported his ex-wife, Marry Mubaiwas alleged criminal activities, and has welcomed the recent forfeiture and auctioning of her assets in South Africa.\n\nMubaiwa has lost her luxury home in Pretoria, along with two high-end vehicles, in the neighbouring country.\n\nOn Monday, the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) confirmed the Gauteng High Courts ruling from 5 December 2022, which stipulated that Mubaiwas assets, a property in Sterrewag and two Land Rover Range Rovers, were the products of money laundering and illicit financial flows.\n\nOne of the vehicles has already been auctioned off, with the funds intended to compensate victims.\n\nThe ruling, which follows a preservation order issued in 2022, strengthens cross-border efforts to recover assets suspected of being gained through criminal activity. For Mubaiwa, the loss represents yet another setback in her ongoing legal battles.\n\nIn a statement released through his legal representatives, Machingura Legal Practitioners, Chiwenga hailed the development as significant and praised the collaborative efforts between the National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe and its South African counterparts.\n\nOur client welcomes this significant development and commends the collaborative efforts between the NPA of Zimbabwe and its South African counterparts in pursuing justice across borders. The ruling by the Gauteng High Court affirms the principle that proceeds of crime have no sanctuary within the region, the statement read.\n\nChiwengas lawyers also stated that the forfeiture of Mubaiwas property would see the proceeds repatriated to Zimbabwe, in line with the global fight against illicit financial flows and the recovery of assets acquired through unlawful means.\n\nThe VP maintains that he reported his ex-wife after becoming aware of her alleged criminal activity.\n\nOur client wishes to place on record that upon becoming aware of the unlawful activities in question, he promptly reported the matter and has since rendered his full cooperation to the NPA. His actions were motivated solely by the national interest and in furtherance of justice and accountability, the statement added.\n\nMubaiwa, who has been in ill health for some time, has endured significant personal losses beyond the forfeiture of assets.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nMany Zimbabweans who left the country at the peak of economic and political turmoil, and settled in numerous countries, including South Africa, are now investing back home, while others are returning to their ancestral nation.\n\nThese were the views expressed by Zanu PF national spokesperson, Christopher Mutsvangwa, who was recently in South Africa forthe 2025 Liberation Movements Summit hosted by the African National Congress (ANC) in Kempton Park.\n\nThe summit concluded on Monday and was hosted under the theme: Defending the liberation gains, advancing integrated socio-economic development, strengthening solidarity for a better Africa.\n\nSouthern African liberation movements, including the ANC, Peoples Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), Namibias ruling party, the South West Africa Peoples Organisation (Swapo); Mozambiques Frente de Libertao de Moambique (Frelimo); Zanu-PF, and Tanzanias ruling Chama Cha Mapinduzi (CCM) were represented at high level at the summit in Gauteng.\n\nMutsvangwa, in an interview withbroadcaster Newzroom Afrika, was asked for his views on the prevailing political and economic situation in Zimbabwe, which has resulted in the extensive migration of Zimbabweans into South Africa, estimated in the millions, sparking tensions in South African communities.\n\nIn his response, Mutsvangwa said Zimbabweans in South Africa are seeking greener pastures, but the situation back home has significantly improved.\n\nIt is the search for better pastures, that is natural. South Africa had the advantage of having comparative access to capital as a white apartheid state. In colonial times, capital into Africa followed white, and South Africa has the biggest white population on the African continent. All those Western countries gave South Africa a certain edge in access to capital.\n\nWe in Zimbabwe/Rhodesia were second in terms of our white population. We also had comparatively better access to capital than any other African country, and we had migration of labour from Mozambique, Malawi, and Zambia into Zimbabwe.\n\nThe former Zimbabwean ambassador to the Peoples Republic of China said people follow where they see an advantage in terms of development and capital.\n\nNow things have changed. We are now having capital in a flat global world where China can supply capital, India can supply capital, Riyadh can supply capital, so we now have an Africa that is going to global markets, getting capital. That discrepancy in access to capital, which was the case for the colonial era, is beginning to disappear.\n\nYou cannot believe it, there is now a seamless environment between life in Zimbabwe and life abroad. That is why our diaspora is coming back to Zimbabwe, putting a lot of money  our diaspora feels at home, they are now beginning to invest at home. For your information, the biggest diaspora migration is white.\n\nHe said the white Zimbabweans who had fled the country at the onset of majority rule in 1980 make up a good number of the people moving back into the landlocked Southern African nation ruled by President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nSo the return of the white diaspora back to Zimbabwe is actually an indication that things are getting better in Zimbabwe. Remember we are operating the hardest currency in the world, the US dollar, and if you can make your economy succeed on the back of the US dollar, it means you are doing very well as a country, said theWar Veterans Association chairperson.\n\nSpeaking to IOL,Dr Alexander Rusero, head of the department of international relations and diplomacy at the Africa University situated in Mutare, Zimbabwe, said the landlocked country seemingly has its worst times behind it  economically and politically.\n\nI think in all fairness, Zimbabwe has had its bad tide and we are definitely past that in as much as the mess we were once in as a country is concerned. That explains why you hear an opposition voice. We are as good as not having an opposition in Zimbabwe, and if you want to look at Zimbabwes dynamics currently, just look at the balance of forces within Zanu-PF.\n\n",
