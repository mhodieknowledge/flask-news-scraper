Earlier this month, he was expelled from Zanu PF, where he was a Central Committee member over allegations of indiscipline.\n\nThe war vet has recently done explosive live broadcasts calling on citizens to take to the streets on March 31.\n\nIn a statement, Thursday, Home Affairs Minister Kazembe Kazembe warned citizens against participating in the planned protests.\n\nThe illegal acts being mobilised undermine the prevailing security, peace and stability.The retrogressive intents should be dismissed with the contempt they deserve. Those fronting the mobilisation should stand warned.\n\nThe countrys security services are on high alert to ensure the sustained safety and security of the public. The Zimbabwean Republic Police has made adequate deployments to guarantee an environment conducive to socio-economic development and unhindered movement of people in all parts of the country, reads part of the statement.\n\nPolice have since issued a two-month-long prohibition order from March 27 until May 31, barring the carrying of weapons including swords, knobkerries, axes, daggers, machetes and catapults in Harare and Bulawayo.\n\nThere has also been a heavy deployment of police officers in both urban and rural areas to maintain peace and order.\n\nAdded Kazembe, May I also remind the public of the need to abide by the provisions of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act Chapter 24, which is categorical on the maintenance of public order. Equally, I need not emphasize that we are all expected to remain guided by the provisions of Section 164 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act and Section 164 of the Cyber Security and Data Protection Act on offences relating to electronic communications and materials.\n\nThe relevant instruments would be invoked to deal with those who unlawfully engage in transmitting, broadcasting and distributing data messages to any person, group of persons or to the public with the intent to incite acts of violence against any persons or to cause damage to any property.\n\n",

They quickly jumped onto accompanying vehicles and ran away. Police are conducting investigations into the incidents, Nyathi said.\n\nThe curious timing of the attacks, so soon after Gezas pronouncements, have raised eyebrows. Some observers are suggesting that Gezas words might have been the straw that broke the camels back, inciting individuals to take matters into their own hands.\n\nOther commentators believe that there is more to this than meets the eye, and that the bombings could be the result of internal power struggles inside Zanu PF.\n\n",

            "content": "Al Jazeera\n\nEvery morning, Dumisani Ngara* gets up at dawn to catch a 6:30am bus to work at Zimbabwes Ministry of National Housing and Social Amenities. The government-provided bus is free for civil servants in Harare, and on his $250 monthly salary, he tries to save every cent he can.\n\nOnce at work, Ngara  dressed neatly in a suit and tie  makes sure the days files are all in order before the office opens at 8:30am. In between paperwork and meetings, he takes breaks. At 1pm, he opens a lunchbox packed with rice and meat he prepared at home.\n\nMost of us here, we work to the best of our ability. It is a profession I love. It comes also with job security, said the 48-year-old husband and father of three.\n\nBut by 5pm, as the end of the workday arrives, instead of heading home, Ngara rushes to a restroom in the pub across the street, where he changes into sweatpants and a T-shirt before walking four blocks to join his oldest son at a pavement stall in the city centre. From there, they sell groceries to passers-by.\n\nNgaras side hustle is a secret, as Zimbabwean government workers are restricted from holding other jobs. But he says life is tough on a single-source income.\n\nNgara has been a government worker since 2010, but making ends meet has been especially difficult since 2019, when inflation shot up to 300 percent and the value of his salary eroded.\n\nTo afford rent and other expenses, his family had to make a plan.\n\nMy wife is into vending of fruits and vegetables at home while I do the same after work here in the CBD, Ngara said, referring to the central business district.\n\nBy day, Ngara is a government worker at the Ministry of National Housing and Social Amenities. After hours, he sets up shop vending groceries on the streets [Calvin Manika/Al Jazeera]\n\nThe Ngaras are not alone.\n\nOut on Harares streets, a growing number of civil servants are turning to vending once their official workday ends.\n\nMost work until 9 or 10pm, although Ngara heads home at about 8pm.\n\nMany of those turning to vending work are teachers. Takavafira Zhou is the president of the Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe and says teachers are taking on these extra, informal jobs because salaries are pathetic and families cannot make ends meet.\n\nPeople are failing to pay school fees, to feed their families, to pay medical bills, to pay rentals, he explained. Therefore, government workers have designed methods of survival.\n\nAccording to Zhou, the majority of government workers have now turned to some sort of vending, although there is no data to confirm this.\n\nAccording to ZimStats, the government statistics agency, the informal sector in Zimbabwe contributes 18 percent to the countrys gross domestic product (GDP) and 20 percent of employment. But experts say the government downplays the numbers and that a majority of Zimbabweans work in the informal sector.\n\nIt is a situation where you have a choice to starve or to find survival methods, bearing in mind that the employer is uncaring, Zhou added, accusing the state of offering unreasonable salaries and not improving working conditions for teachers.\n\nBefore November 2018, most Zimbabwean civil servants, including teachers, earned a basic monthly salary of about $540.\n\nHowever, since the economic downturn in 2019, the government stopped offering full US dollar-pegged payments. Salaries are now split into two portions: a US dollar (USD) component  $160 for most civil servants  and an amount in local currency, which equals less than $100 when converted.\n\nLate one afternoon, Ngara and his 21-year-old son spread out their wares on the pavement in front of registered supermarkets and stores selling the same goods they do.\n\nLast year, in a bid to tackle hyperinflation, the government introduced a new gold-backed currency, the ZiG, and imposed stricter regulations on the use of foreign currency. As a result, registered stores must trade in the local currency or use official USD exchange rates.\n\nInformal vendors, meanwhile, use black market exchange rates, meaning their products are cheaper for customers. They also trade in hard USD currency. Most Zimbabweans keep USD notes instead of local bills, as it is more stable, and prefer buying from vendors.\n\nWe do not accept the local currency, explained Tariro Musekiwa, a street vendor sitting on a cardboard box, who only trades in USD.\n\nCurrently, the official exchange rate is $1 to 26.4 ZiG, while the unofficial black-market rate ranges from 36 to 40 ZiG per USD, giving consumers more for less on the informal market.\n\nPeople need to buy goods at a lower cost, said Musekiwa, who sells soaps, cordial drinks and yoghurts. Because the same products are more expensive in stores, he believes the vendors are offering an important service.\n\nNgara agreed. If you look in the streets, all pavements and corners are filled with people selling something. So I try to sell goods which sell quickly at lower prices, he said.\n\nWe are in a jungle, and it is the survival of the fittest.\n\nFor registered store owners, though, the influx of vendors has not been a blessing.\n\nTrymore Chirozva, the manager at Food World, a supermarket retailer in Harare, expressed dismay that vendors sell similar products outside on the pavement.\n\nUnlike before, when vendors would sell fruits and vegetables only, of recent they have become mini-stores, affecting our business, he said.\n\nHarares CBD has just five official vending sites, which accommodate fewer than 200 vendors. Yet, thousands of informal vendors flock to the streets every day.\n\nNgara and many others admit they operate without official permits but say they find ways around the rules. The officers just demand some bribes, or sometimes just pass [us by].\n\nVendor Tariro Musekiwa says she trades only in USD [Calvin Manika/Al Jazeera]\n\nChirozva believes stores like his are negatively affected because vendors are not regulated as strictly as big businesses.\n\nPatience Maodza, an economist, believes vendors are leveraging on the regulation gap.\n\nThe government overregulates shops but not vendors, creating [an] unfair business environment for the registered entities which are tax compliant.\n\nIn the past 12 months, Zimbabwe has witnessed the closure of leading regional chain stores and clothing lines, most citing two reasons: the restrictions on the use of USD and an influx of vendors taking over their business without government intervention.\n\nOne of Zimbabwes largest wholesale hardware companies, N Richards Group, has closed two branches.\n\nSpeaking to Zimbabwes parliament, Archie Dongo, the director of the N Richards Group, said the government is overburdening those who already pay tax.\n\nReduce the taxation level and the tax heads, but collect that tax from as many players as possible. In that way, we will not have a problem of fiscal mobilisation in the economy; we actually believe well get more tax that way, Dongo said.\n\nOK Zimbabwe, the countrys top supermarket retailer, has struggled to restock its branches over the past year  a challenge compounded by the introduction of the ZiG, which disrupted supply chains and pricing structures. The retailer closed five of its supermarkets in January.\n\nEconomist Kajiva believes that the governments economic policies have played a significant role in the business sectors struggles.\n\nThe policy has resulted in a sharp reduction in money supply, placing considerable pressure on businesses, including major retailers like OK Zimbabwe and N Richards, he said.\n\nThese companies have been forced to downsize in response to a challenging economic climate driven by tight fiscal conditions.\n\nStreet vendor Portia Mbano, centre, quit her government job and works full-time, selling groceries on the street [Calvin Manika/Al Jazeera]\n\nAs traditional businesses struggle, so do traditional workers.\n\nWhile many like Ngara are embracing side hustles, some have abandoned their government jobs altogether.\n\nPortia Mbano, 39, left her job as a civil servant to become a full-time vendor.\n\nAt first, she started as a small-time seller after office hours. But she soon realised she was ageing and needs something tangible.\n\nI realised that I was losing a lot by spending time at the offices [rather] than to take this as a full-time job, she said.\n\nShe now sells a variety of groceries and small household items from a pavement stall in the CBD.\n\nSamuel Mangoma, the director of Vendors Initiative for Social and Economic Transformation (VISET), an organisation advancing the rights of informal economy workers across Africa, told Al Jazeera there has been a sharp rise in street vendors in central Harare.\n\nThis is as a result of limited opportunities in the formal job market, he said, with many people now finding refuge in the informal sector.\n\nHowever, he frowns on vendors operating in front of stores, selling the same goods for cheaper prices.\n\nPeople are trying to survive in this very difficult economic environment. But, we dont encourage our members to go and occupy spaces in front of grocery shops and big retailers. We encourage our members to operate from spaces where we dont create conflict unnecessarily with other business players, he said.\n\nNevertheless, out on the streets, government workers continue to set up their informal shops, with Ngara saying he plans to continue until his family is stable enough to survive without it.\n\nI need my son to go to university and at least own a property for my family, so I need both jobs until such a time, Ngara said.\n\nDespite challenges we face in the streets, including the government through the council and police trying to remove us from the CBD, we continue the cat and mouse game  at least for now.\n\n*Name changed to protect privacy\n\n",

The USD year-on-year inflation rate (annual percentage change) for the month of March 2025 as measured by the all-items USD Consumer Price Index (CPI), was 15%.\n\nThe ZWG month-on-month inflation rate was -0.1% in March 2025, shedding -0.6 percentage points on the February 2025 rate of 0.5 percent, said ZIMSTAT.\n\nThe Food Poverty Line (FPL) for one person in March 2025 was ZWG864.20. FPL represents the amount of money that an individual requires to afford a daily minimum energy intake of 2,100 calories. ZIMSTAT uses the consumer basket for an individual deemed to be extremely poor to calculate the poverty line.\n\nThe Total Consumption Poverty Line (TCPL) for one person was ZWG 1,260.52 in March 2025. TCPL is derived by adding the non-food consumption expenditures of an individual deemed to be extremely poor and the FPL.\n\nDuring the period, the total value of exported goods in February 2025 was US$ 512.6 million, representing a 21.4% decrease from USD 652.0 million reported in January 2025.\n\nImports for February 2025 amounted to US$730.3 million, a decrease of 2.5 % from US$749.2 million recorded in January 2025.
