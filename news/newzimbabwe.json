            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Electricity Transmission and Distribution Company (ZETDC) has blamed a private contractor for failing to adhere to safety procedures following the fatal electrocution of a 19-year-old student in Budiriro 1 Extension, Harare.\n\nThe student, who was on an industrial attachment, was electrocuted on Wednesday after power was restored to a line he was working on.\n\nIn a statement issued Thursday, ZETDC clarified that the deceased was not one of its employees.\n\nZETDC extends its deepest and most sincere condolences to the family, friends, and colleagues of the 19-year-old student, who was reportedly attached to a private contractor, read the statement.\n\nAccording to the company, preliminary investigations revealed that no permit or authorisation had been issued for work on the affected Medium Voltage (MV) line, and that the contractor had acted independently.\n\nZETDCs preliminary investigations have established that ZETDC had not issued a permit or authorisation for any work on the MV line at this location. The contractor was operating outside of ZETDCs jurisdiction and safety protocols, said the power utility.\n\nThe company urged the public to engage it directly for any electrical work involving its infrastructure so as to ensure compliance with safety standards.\n\nThe safety of our customers and the public remains our highest priority. We urge everyone to engage ZETDC for all electrical works on the electricity grid, added the statement.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Emelia Muchawa has sentenced Harare nurse Bridget Makaza to 27 years in prison for the cold-blooded murder of her husband, Kurai Bus company owner Macloud Zvavovaviri Mapanga, whom she shot three times as he slept in their Strathaven home in 2018.\n\nMakaza was last week convicted of what the court described as a calculated act of vengeance fuelled by jealousy, polygamy and deceit. Justice Muchawa said Makaza executed her husband and then staged a fake robbery to conceal the crime.\n\nThe accused unlawfully and with intent to kill, executed her husband while he slept, ruled Justice Muchawa. She aimed at the upper part of his body and delivered three fatal shots, then staged an armed robbery to cover her tracks.\n\nWhen handing down the sentence, the judge said:\n\nWhereupon, after reading documents filed of record and hearing counsel, it is ordered that the offender who was found guilty of murder as defined in section 47 (1) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act [Chapter 9:23] is hereby sentenced to 27 (twenty-seven) years imprisonment.\n\nThe court heard Makaza used a .38 Amadeo Rossi revolver with an erased serial number, smuggled from South Africa under the pretext of buying medication. After killing her husband, she screamed Thief! Thief! and falsely claimed robbers had stolen US$12,000.\n\nProsecutor B. Murevanhema said, There were no robbers. There was no break-in. The story was a fabrication to mask premeditated murder.\n\nPolice investigations confirmed there were no signs of forced entry. The firearm and gloves were later recovered from a swamp in Belvedere after Makaza led detectives to the spot.\n\nMakaza fled to South Africa after being granted bail and was re-arrested in December 2024 upon returning to Zimbabwe, claiming she missed her children.\n\nDuring the trial, she claimed self-defence, alleging her husband tried to attack her, but the judge dismissed this as a lame and incredible fabrication. Forensic expert Admire Mutizwa testified that the revolver required deliberate trigger pressure and could not have discharged accidentally.\n\nJustice Muchawa concluded that Makaza procured the weapon, waited for her husband to sleep, and executed him in cold blood.\n\nShe was methodical, the judge said. Her conduct before, during, and after the murder shows beyond doubt that this was a planned execution.\n\n",

Kasondo was Dembares hero last Sunday, scoring the equaliser in their 11 draw against Highlanders at Barbourfields Stadium.\n\nThe semi-final showdown comes as both traditional giants search for redemption following inconsistent league performances that have left them hovering near the lower half of the table.\n\nHead-to-head in league competitions, Dynamos have not beaten Highlanders in open play since 2015, adding extra pressure ahead of Sundays clash.\n\nHowever, Dembare have already made history by becoming the first team to reach the Chibuku Super Cup semi-finals for three consecutive seasons, a feat they will be hoping to build on despite the absence of two key players.\n\n",
