            "content": "IOL\n\nPolice at Elukwatini, in Mpumalanga, are investigating an inquest case following the retrieval of the bodies of three men from the Nkomazi River.\n\nProvincial police spokesperson, Brigadier Donald Mdhluli, said the bodies of the three men were retrieved by SA Police Service (SAPS) divers at a game reserve in Elukwatini on Friday.\n\nThe retrieved bodies, according to police, had no visible injuries.\n\nAccording to a (police) report, on the said Friday, concerned people residing with the three men reported them as missing at Elukwatini SAPS. The complainants indicated that the three had informed them that they were heading to the game reserve, but strangely, they never returned, said Mdhluli.\n\nInvestigating police officers took the complainants and headed to the game reserve.\n\nAt the game reserve, police officers were informed by officials that certain individuals frequently gain entry into the premises without authorization.\n\nFurther information indicated that, about a week ago, there were some people that were noticed at the game reserve, but (the trespassers) fled upon noticing the authorities and were never seen again, said Mdhluli.\n\nPolice officers then continued with their investigations around the premises, and noticed three bodies floating in the Nkomazi River.\n\nThe SAPS team from search and rescue, as well as divers, were summoned to the scene. The three bodies were retrieved from the river, hence an inquest case is being probed in order to establish the cause of death, said Mdluli.\n\nPolice said a postmortem will be conducted, and the identities of the three men will be shared in due course, once their next of kin are notified.\n\nPreliminary investigation by the police has thus far revealed that the men are originally from Zimbabwe, said Mdhluli.\n\nMeanwhile, acting provincial commissioner of SAPS in Mpumalanga, Major General Zeph Mkhwanazi has since ordered a thorough investigation into the shocking incident to unveil the truth of what has actually transpired, leading to the death of the three individuals.\n\nEarlier this month,IOL reported thatAsher Watkins, a millionaire from the United States of America, was gored to death by a buffalo he was hunting in Limpopo.\n\nThe 52-year-old hunter had reportedly paid Coernraad Vermaak Safaris around R177,221 for the trip in which he planned to stalk and kill wild animals in the expedition.\n\nIt is with deep sadness and heavy hearts that we confirm the tragic death of our client and friend Asher Watkins from the USA. While on ahuntingsafari with us in Limpopo province, Asher was fatally injured in a sudden and unprovoked attack by an unwounded buffalo.\n\nAmerican millionaire Asher Watkins poses wth one of his kills before the tables turned on him and he was gored to death by a Cape buffalo during a hunting trip.

This is a devastating incident, and our hearts go out to his loved ones, said the safaris Hans Vermaak in a statement.\n\nThe safari said Cape buffalo have some of the most fearsome reputations on the planet.\n\nResponsible for several deaths and many injuries to hunters each year, the buffalo is regarded as the most dangerous animal to pursue in Africa, let alone the world, the safari said on its website.\n\n",

            "content": "By Kudzai Tamary Chikiwa | Global Voices\n\nZimbabwes public debt servicing crisis has had far-reaching consequences for the countrys healthcare system. With a significant portion of thenational budgetdedicated to debt repayment, the healthcare sector has been left underfunded and understaffed. This has resulted in a shortage of critical equipment, medicines, and healthcare personnel, ultimately affecting the quality of care provided to patients.The story of Memory Ncube, a Zimbabwean motherand her baby, Tendai, is a tragic illustration of the human cost of this crisis.\n\nIn the quiet moments, Memorys mind wanders back to the day her world shattered. Her preterm baby girl, Tendai, had been fighting for her life, struggling with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). In a bid to save the new life, Memory was transferred from rural Zvishavane district hospital toMpilo Central HospitalinBulawayo, Zimbabwes second-largest city. This was not because the doctors in Zvishavane were incompetent, but because they lacked the necessary equipment, including a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine.\n\nFull of hope that her child would make it, Memory traveled 185 kilometers (114.954 miles) toMpilo Central Hospital, which is one of the referral hospitals for patients from the Southern region of Zimbabwe. Recently, the hospital received a lifeline in the form of a donation from theHigherlife Foundation, which provided critical equipment, including CPAP machines, suction machines, monitors, jaundice meters, and phototherapy machines. Prior to this donation, the hospital had been grappling with a shortage of equipment, often resulting in premature deaths of patients.\n\nHowever, tragically for this family, when she arrived at the hospital, it was too late, and her daughter had died. She sobbingly recalled her babys death:\n\nMy heart breaks when I think of what happened to my daughter. If only there was equipment at the hospital, I was not going to travel all this way with a critical baby. I wish the government knew the devastating impact of not servicing public hospitals.\n\nZimbabwes public debt servicing has become a suffocating burden, squeezing the life out of the healthcare system. Witha total public debt of approximately USD 21.53 billion, with much of it owed to the World Bank, China, France, and other international creditors, the governments debt repayment obligations are consuming a significant chunk of the national budget. In the 2025 budget, theMinistry of Health and Child Carewas allocated ZWD 27.8 billion (approximately USD 1.039 billion), just 7.1 percent of public spending, which falls short of theAbuja Declarations 15 percent allocation target.\n\nTheAbuja Declarationis a commitment made byAfrican Unionmember states, including Zimbabwe, in 2001 to allocate at least 15 percent of their national budgets to improve the healthcare system.\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncube has defended the move, saying,\n\nWe need to go through some period of austerity, but the same builds us towards prosperity.\n\nHowever, for Memory and countless other mothers, the prosperity promised seems a distant dream. Memorys baby is just one of many newborns who die before they reach one month in Zimbabwe. The neonatal mortality rate in Zimbabwe stands at37 deaths per 1,000 live births, a grim statistic that reflects the human cost of inadequate healthcare funding.\n\nCommunity Working Group on Health ZimbabweExecutive Director Itai Rusike concurred that the health sector remains distressed due to public debt servicing. He explained:\n\nShortages in healthcare personnel, inadequate infrastructure, high disease burden, and expensive specialist services continue to affect service delivery. These systemic issues are compounded by low public spending on health and weak financial protection mechanisms. Unfortunately, its the poor who suffer the most.\n\nHe emphasised the need for increased investment in building a robust and accessible health system, particularly in rural areas. He noted:\n\nAchieving universal health coverage requires strong public funding and a commitment to treating healthcare as a fundamental right.\n\nTo challenge economic injustice and notorious austerity measures, organizations like theEconomic Justice for Women Projectare educating women on public finances. The project aims to empower women with knowledge about public debt and its impact on service delivery, enabling them to advocate for change. Director Margaret Mutsamvi said:\n\nIssues to do with public debt seem complicated and elitist, but we are now going down to communities to educate them. We take time to explain to them the nexus between public debt servicing and service delivery. This can help them challenge the status quo from an informed perspective.\n\nMutsamvi reiterated that when a government introduces austerity measures in favor of public debt servicing, its the ordinary citizens who suffer.\n\nRight now, our health system is in shambles because a huge chunk of money is put towards clearing external and internal debt. The ordinary people suffer; this is why we have a high neonatal mortality rate in Zimbabwe. Women are the most affected, as they bear the brunt of austerity measures.\n\nShe added:\n\nWhen the government is prioritising public debt servicing it affects public hospitals. This is why there is a rise of privatisation of health facilities, mushrooming of private hospitals, clinics and pharmacies. Sometimes we have seen cases where there are no painkillers in hospitals and its even worse in rural areas. When the government is not funding, Its a woman who is paying for it.\n\nShe continued:\n\nWomen bear the pain of losing a child, caring for the sick at home and going through all the emotional stress. This is unpaid carework.\n\nThe story of Memory and her baby, Tendai, is a heartbreaking reminder of the human cost of Zimbabwes debt crisis. It is a call to action for policymakers to prioritize the health and well-being of the nations most vulnerable citizens.\n\n",

            "content": "By Basillioh Rukanga l BBC News\n\nA Kenyan magistrate last week expressed the hope that a British property tycoon would finally find rest in eternal peace, after his body had spent 11 years in a mortuary.But last weeks conclusion to the decade-long inquest into Harry Roy Veevers death in 2013 still leaves many questions unanswered.It was a case that involved accusations of murder by poisoning, rancorous legal proceedings, the exhumation of a body after almost a year and ultimately divided four siblings  two sons from his first marriage and two daughters from the second.In one hearing, the sisters, Hellen and Alexandra, were reprimanded by the magistrate for shouting out that a witness was lying and threatened with spending time in a cell, reports said.In another, Hellen Veevers emerged from the courthouse with a message she had written on her vest-top: My daddy was not murdered.Despite the lengthy inquest into the death of the wealthy 64-year-old, the magistrate, David Odhiambo, found that the cause of death could not be determined due to the level of [the bodys] decomposition after spending so long underground. He ordered that the corpse be released to the family for reburial at a place of their choice.An unsatisfactory ending that could lead to further disputes. Lawyers for both sides told the BBC they were considering their next steps.When you have a family split down the middle, how does the court say the remains should be released to the family, when both sides have been fighting since 2013? said Francis Kinyua Kamundi, representing Mr Veevers sons, Richard and Philip.Harry Roy Veevers daughters have maintained that their father died of natural causes.From the start of his detailed 95-page ruling, the magistrate acknowledged the deeply entrenched feud between the family members.Although the death of a loved one often brings survivors closer through the inevitable grieving, he wrote, The emotions associated with death can also tear survivors apart.This was definitely a case of the latter.What happened soon after his burial tore the family apart and marked the beginning of a legal drama, according to Mr Odhiambo.On one side of the case were the sons and on the other were Mr Veevers second wife, Azra Parvin Din, along with their daughters.The children were living in the UK, while their father and Ms Parvin Din, who had been together for more than 30 years, were living on the Kenyan coast.The family feud started after his death on Valentines Day 2013, at his home in Mombasa where he had long settled and had an extensive property portfolio. The children then travelled to Kenya.The drama began the moment they arrived.It was Saturday 16 February, a day before the burial.According to Richard Veevers court testimony, Ms Parvin Din was agitated when questioned about the deceased. His brother Philip also told the court that she had initially refused his request to view his fathers body.Ms Parvin Din said he had died of a heart attack.When they finally saw their father the following day, Richard said he noticed redness in the face and the lips were purple and pink, according to the magistrates summary.Tensions seemed to escalate over Ms Parvin Din and her daughters reactions to the photos that Philip had taken of the body  including demands that he should delete them, the brothers said.In the magistrates ruling, he said Alexandra Veevers had testified that she did not see any marks on her fathers body and that she only saw the face since the body was wrapped in a cloth She stated that they asked for the videos and pictures but Richard and Philip refused to give them out and she didnt understand why they did not want to share the photos.Mr Veevers was buried shortly afterwards without a post-mortem or police involvement.It was Ms Parvin Dins decision that the deceased should be buried without post-mortem and did not consult anyone, the court ruling said.

A further complication is that there does not appear to have been a will.Unconvinced by the circumstances surrounding his death, the sons filed an application for the exhumation of their fathers body and a formal investigation into the cause of death.A court order for exhumation was granted on 28 April 2013.

The doctor has since faced disciplinary action from the medical regulatory body for his handling of the matter.As for Ms Parvin Din, the magistrate said, nothing she had done or not done was enough to find her responsible for Mr Veevers death.And yet, despite the finality of the ruling, the end result is a body that has remained in a mortuary for more than 11 years is still suspended in legal uncertainty, caught between siblings with irreconcilable wishes.It is not a choice either side would willingly make.The sons have all along argued that their father was a British citizen and should be buried in the UK, while his second wife and her daughters have wanted him to be reburied in Kenya.The court acknowledged that determining Mr Veevers final resting place was nerve-racking because of the absence of formal legislative provisions to guide burial disputes in Kenya.It was also a tough decision because Mr Veevers did not ascribe to a specific custom, and no will had been presented to show that he wished to exit the world in a certain way.Nor was there any evidence to show that he had a sour relationship with any of his close family members so as to exclude anyone from claiming his body.The magistrate stated that he would not wish to interfere with who would be given the body but urged them to seek legal redress from another forum. He also noted that the dispute over inheritance was still pending in another court.Mr Veevers long wait for eternal peace will not be over any time soon.\n\nA Kenyan magistrate last week expressed the hope that a British property tycoon would finally find rest in eternal peace, after his body had spent 11 years in a mortuary.\n\nBut last weeks conclusion to the decade-long inquest into Harry Roy Veevers death in 2013 still leaves many questions unanswered.It was a case that involved accusations of murder by poisoning, rancorous legal proceedings, the exhumation of a body after almost a year and ultimately divided four siblings  two sons from his first marriage and two daughters from the second.In one hearing, the sisters, Hellen and Alexandra, were reprimanded by the magistrate for shouting out that a witness was lying and threatened with spending time in a cell, reports said.In another, Hellen Veevers emerged from the courthouse with a message she had written on her vest-top: My daddy was not murdered.Despite the lengthy inquest into the death of the wealthy 64-year-old, the magistrate, David Odhiambo, found that the cause of death could not be determined due to the level of [the bodys] decomposition after spending so long underground. He ordered that the corpse be released to the family for reburial at a place of their choice.An unsatisfactory ending that could lead to further disputes. Lawyers for both sides told the BBC they were considering their next steps.When you have a family split down the middle, how does the court say the remains should be released to the family, when both sides have been fighting since 2013? said Francis Kinyua Kamundi, representing Mr Veevers sons, Richard and Philip.Harry Roy Veevers daughters have maintained that their father died of natural causes.From the start of his detailed 95-page ruling, the magistrate acknowledged the deeply entrenched feud between the family members.Although the death of a loved one often brings survivors closer through the inevitable grieving, he wrote, The emotions associated with death can also tear survivors apart.This was definitely a case of the latter.What happened soon after his burial tore the family apart and marked the beginning of a legal drama, according to Mr Odhiambo.On one side of the case were the sons and on the other were Mr Veevers second wife, Azra Parvin Din, along with their daughters.The children were living in the UK, while their father and Ms Parvin Din, who had been together for more than 30 years, were living on the Kenyan coast.The family feud started after his death on Valentines Day 2013, at his home in Mombasa where he had long settled and had an extensive property portfolio. The children then travelled to Kenya.The drama began the moment they arrived.It was Saturday 16 February, a day before the burial.According to Richard Veevers court testimony, Ms Parvin Din was agitated when questioned about the deceased. His brother Philip also told the court that she had initially refused his request to view his fathers body.Ms Parvin Din said he had died of a heart attack.When they finally saw their father the following day, Richard said he noticed redness in the face and the lips were purple and pink, according to the magistrates summary.Tensions seemed to escalate over Ms Parvin Din and her daughters reactions to the photos that Philip had taken of the body  including demands that he should delete them, the brothers said.In the magistrates ruling, he said Alexandra Veevers had testified that she did not see any marks on her fathers body and that she only saw the face since the body was wrapped in a cloth She stated that they asked for the videos and pictures but Richard and Philip refused to give them out and she didnt understand why they did not want to share the photos.Mr Veevers was buried shortly afterwards without a post-mortem or police involvement.It was Ms Parvin Dins decision that the deceased should be buried without post-mortem and did not consult anyone, the court ruling said.

His brother Philip also told the court that she had initially refused his request to view his fathers body.Ms Parvin Din said he had died of a heart attack.When they finally saw their father the following day, Richard said he noticed redness in the face and the lips were purple and pink, according to the magistrates summary.Tensions seemed to escalate over Ms Parvin Din and her daughters reactions to the photos that Philip had taken of the body  including demands that he should delete them, the brothers said.In the magistrates ruling, he said Alexandra Veevers had testified that she did not see any marks on her fathers body and that she only saw the face since the body was wrapped in a cloth She stated that they asked for the videos and pictures but Richard and Philip refused to give them out and she didnt understand why they did not want to share the photos.Mr Veevers was buried shortly afterwards without a post-mortem or police involvement.It was Ms Parvin Dins decision that the deceased should be buried without post-mortem and did not consult anyone, the court ruling said. Nor did she inform the police about the death, stating that she was not aware that she had to report it.The Islamic burial, done quickly according to tradition, further raised suspicions from his sons, who said their father was not Muslim and had been buried under a false name.The brothers, Richard and Philip, were in court for some of the inquest that took place over a 10-year period.According to the court documents, Richard Veevers questioned why their father was being buried as a Muslim yet he was a Christian and he was told that if buried in an open cemetery, people would dig him up and steal gold from his body.Ms Parvin Din testified that Mr Veevers had converted to Islam.The brothers also accused Ms Parvin Din and her daughters of poisoning their father, so that they could inherit his multimillion-dollar portfolio  which they vehemently denied. A further complication is that there does not appear to have been a will.Unconvinced by the circumstances surrounding his death, the sons filed an application for the exhumation of their fathers body and a formal investigation into the cause of death.A court order for exhumation was granted on 28 April 2013. However, the body was not dug up until 31 January 2014  more than nine months later.The lawyer representing the sons has blamed the delay on the opposing side, citing repeated frustrations that stalled the process.By the time the exhumation could happen, the body had significantly decomposed.In the final ruling this week, the magistrate said that due to the level of its decomposition at the time of exhumation, it was too hard to say what had led to his death.The cause of death of the deceased remains unknown and as such nobody can be called to answer to any charge, he said.Over the years, the case has passed through the hands of numerous magistrates and judges, all trying to weave through the haze of unanswered questions and delays, to find the elusive truth.The magistrate, Mr Odhiambo, noted that when it first began, he was just starting out his legal practice and would read about it in the newspapers, with no idea that almost a decade later I would be presiding over the case.In January last year, the inquest had neared its end  after years of hearings, a magistrate ruled that Mr Veevers death was not suspicious.However, it was soon reopened after his sons successfully challenged the ruling at the High Court. Citing irregular procedures it referred the case back to a magistrates court, allowing them to submit new evidence.Mr Odhiambo highlighted other issues that plagued the convoluted case, including conflicting forensic reports submitted by different pathologists.One pathologist had traced a highly toxic substance, cyhalothrin, on both the bodys remains and the soil where his body was exhumed.The experts showed to us that there could be different interpretations that the lay person is left wondering what to believe.But the magistrate noted that this evidence had been called into question as samples had reached the UK four months after exhumation and they were not in the containers they had originally been packed in. Two other pathologists in the case did not find any traces of the toxic substance in their samples.The experts showed to us that there could be different interpretations about a subject [such] that the lay person is left wondering what to believe, Mr Odhiambo said.He said a lot of things had happened soon after Mr Veevers death, but it was not possible to determine whether the acts of commission and omission by different parties in the case could be tied to the cause of death.He suggested that the parties ought to have handled the matter differently.The doctor who first attended to Mr Veevers should have advised Ms Parvin Din to report the death to the authorities and insisted on a post-mortem, he said.Dr Salim Omars failure to do so, he observed, had contributed to the suspicions surrounding the circumstances of the death. The doctor has since faced disciplinary action from the medical regulatory body for his handling of the matter.As for Ms Parvin Din, the magistrate said, nothing she had done or not done was enough to find her responsible for Mr Veevers death.And yet, despite the finality of the ruling, the end result is a body that has remained in a mortuary for more than 11 years is still suspended in legal uncertainty, caught between siblings with irreconcilable wishes.It is not a choice either side would willingly make.The sons have all along argued that their father was a British citizen and should be buried in the UK, while his second wife and her daughters have wanted him to be reburied in Kenya.The court acknowledged that determining Mr Veevers final resting place was nerve-racking because of the absence of formal legislative provisions to guide burial disputes in Kenya.It was also a tough decision because Mr Veevers did not ascribe to a specific custom, and no will had been presented to show that he wished to exit the world in a certain way.Nor was there any evidence to show that he had a sour relationship with any of his close family members so as to exclude anyone from claiming his body.The magistrate stated that he would not wish to interfere with who would be given the body but urged them to seek legal redress from another forum.

His brother Philip also told the court that she had initially refused his request to view his fathers body.Ms Parvin Din said he had died of a heart attack.When they finally saw their father the following day, Richard said he noticed redness in the face and the lips were purple and pink, according to the magistrates summary.Tensions seemed to escalate over Ms Parvin Din and her daughters reactions to the photos that Philip had taken of the body  including demands that he should delete them, the brothers said.In the magistrates ruling, he said Alexandra Veevers had testified that she did not see any marks on her fathers body and that she only saw the face since the body was wrapped in a cloth She stated that they asked for the videos and pictures but Richard and Philip refused to give them out and she didnt understand why they did not want to share the photos.Mr Veevers was buried shortly afterwards without a post-mortem or police involvement.It was Ms Parvin Dins decision that the deceased should be buried without post-mortem and did not consult anyone, the court ruling said. Nor did she inform the police about the death, stating that she was not aware that she had to report it.The Islamic burial, done quickly according to tradition, further raised suspicions from his sons, who said their father was not Muslim and had been buried under a false name.The brothers, Richard and Philip, were in court for some of the inquest that took place over a 10-year period.According to the court documents, Richard Veevers questioned why their father was being buried as a Muslim yet he was a Christian and he was told that if buried in an open cemetery, people would dig him up and steal gold from his body.Ms Parvin Din testified that Mr Veevers had converted to Islam.The brothers also accused Ms Parvin Din and her daughters of poisoning their father, so that they could inherit his multimillion-dollar portfolio  which they vehemently denied. A further complication is that there does not appear to have been a will.Unconvinced by the circumstances surrounding his death, the sons filed an application for the exhumation of their fathers body and a formal investigation into the cause of death.A court order for exhumation was granted on 28 April 2013. However, the body was not dug up until 31 January 2014  more than nine months later.The lawyer representing the sons has blamed the delay on the opposing side, citing repeated frustrations that stalled the process.By the time the exhumation could happen, the body had significantly decomposed.In the final ruling this week, the magistrate said that due to the level of its decomposition at the time of exhumation, it was too hard to say what had led to his death.The cause of death of the deceased remains unknown and as such nobody can be called to answer to any charge, he said.Over the years, the case has passed through the hands of numerous magistrates and judges, all trying to weave through the haze of unanswered questions and delays, to find the elusive truth.The magistrate, Mr Odhiambo, noted that when it first began, he was just starting out his legal practice and would read about it in the newspapers, with no idea that almost a decade later I would be presiding over the case.In January last year, the inquest had neared its end  after years of hearings, a magistrate ruled that Mr Veevers death was not suspicious.However, it was soon reopened after his sons successfully challenged the ruling at the High Court. Citing irregular procedures it referred the case back to a magistrates court, allowing them to submit new evidence.Mr Odhiambo highlighted other issues that plagued the convoluted case, including conflicting forensic reports submitted by different pathologists.One pathologist had traced a highly toxic substance, cyhalothrin, on both the bodys remains and the soil where his body was exhumed.The experts showed to us that there could be different interpretations that the lay person is left wondering what to believe.But the magistrate noted that this evidence had been called into question as samples had reached the UK four months after exhumation and they were not in the containers they had originally been packed in. Two other pathologists in the case did not find any traces of the toxic substance in their samples.The experts showed to us that there could be different interpretations about a subject [such] that the lay person is left wondering what to believe, Mr Odhiambo said.He said a lot of things had happened soon after Mr Veevers death, but it was not possible to determine whether the acts of commission and omission by different parties in the case could be tied to the cause of death.He suggested that the parties ought to have handled the matter differently.The doctor who first attended to Mr Veevers should have advised Ms Parvin Din to report the death to the authorities and insisted on a post-mortem, he said.Dr Salim Omars failure to do so, he observed, had contributed to the suspicions surrounding the circumstances of the death. The doctor has since faced disciplinary action from the medical regulatory body for his handling of the matter.As for Ms Parvin Din, the magistrate said, nothing she had done or not done was enough to find her responsible for Mr Veevers death.And yet, despite the finality of the ruling, the end result is a body that has remained in a mortuary for more than 11 years is still suspended in legal uncertainty, caught between siblings with irreconcilable wishes.It is not a choice either side would willingly make.The sons have all along argued that their father was a British citizen and should be buried in the UK, while his second wife and her daughters have wanted him to be reburied in Kenya.The court acknowledged that determining Mr Veevers final resting place was nerve-racking because of the absence of formal legislative provisions to guide burial disputes in Kenya.It was also a tough decision because Mr Veevers did not ascribe to a specific custom, and no will had been presented to show that he wished to exit the world in a certain way.Nor was there any evidence to show that he had a sour relationship with any of his close family members so as to exclude anyone from claiming his body.The magistrate stated that he would not wish to interfere with who would be given the body but urged them to seek legal redress from another forum.

Two other pathologists in the case did not find any traces of the toxic substance in their samples.The experts showed to us that there could be different interpretations about a subject [such] that the lay person is left wondering what to believe, Mr Odhiambo said.He said a lot of things had happened soon after Mr Veevers death, but it was not possible to determine whether the acts of commission and omission by different parties in the case could be tied to the cause of death.He suggested that the parties ought to have handled the matter differently.The doctor who first attended to Mr Veevers should have advised Ms Parvin Din to report the death to the authorities and insisted on a post-mortem, he said.Dr Salim Omars failure to do so, he observed, had contributed to the suspicions surrounding the circumstances of the death. The doctor has since faced disciplinary action from the medical regulatory body for his handling of the matter.As for Ms Parvin Din, the magistrate said, nothing she had done or not done was enough to find her responsible for Mr Veevers death.And yet, despite the finality of the ruling, the end result is a body that has remained in a mortuary for more than 11 years is still suspended in legal uncertainty, caught between siblings with irreconcilable wishes.It is not a choice either side would willingly make.The sons have all along argued that their father was a British citizen and should be buried in the UK, while his second wife and her daughters have wanted him to be reburied in Kenya.The court acknowledged that determining Mr Veevers final resting place was nerve-racking because of the absence of formal legislative provisions to guide burial disputes in Kenya.It was also a tough decision because Mr Veevers did not ascribe to a specific custom, and no will had been presented to show that he wished to exit the world in a certain way.Nor was there any evidence to show that he had a sour relationship with any of his close family members so as to exclude anyone from claiming his body.The magistrate stated that he would not wish to interfere with who would be given the body but urged them to seek legal redress from another forum. He also noted that the dispute over inheritance was still pending in another court.Mr Veevers long wait for eternal peace will not be over any time soon.\n\nMs Parvin Din said he had died of a heart attack.\n\nWhen they finally saw their father the following day, Richard said he noticed redness in the face and the lips were purple and pink, according to the magistrates summary.Tensions seemed to escalate over Ms Parvin Din and her daughters reactions to the photos that Philip had taken of the body  including demands that he should delete them, the brothers said.In the magistrates ruling, he said Alexandra Veevers had testified that she did not see any marks on her fathers body and that she only saw the face since the body was wrapped in a cloth She stated that they asked for the videos and pictures but Richard and Philip refused to give them out and she didnt understand why they did not want to share the photos.Mr Veevers was buried shortly afterwards without a post-mortem or police involvement.It was Ms Parvin Dins decision that the deceased should be buried without post-mortem and did not consult anyone, the court ruling said. Nor did she inform the police about the death, stating that she was not aware that she had to report it.The Islamic burial, done quickly according to tradition, further raised suspicions from his sons, who said their father was not Muslim and had been buried under a false name.The brothers, Richard and Philip, were in court for some of the inquest that took place over a 10-year period.According to the court documents, Richard Veevers questioned why their father was being buried as a Muslim yet he was a Christian and he was told that if buried in an open cemetery, people would dig him up and steal gold from his body.Ms Parvin Din testified that Mr Veevers had converted to Islam.The brothers also accused Ms Parvin Din and her daughters of poisoning their father, so that they could inherit his multimillion-dollar portfolio  which they vehemently denied. A further complication is that there does not appear to have been a will.Unconvinced by the circumstances surrounding his death, the sons filed an application for the exhumation of their fathers body and a formal investigation into the cause of death.A court order for exhumation was granted on 28 April 2013.

The doctor has since faced disciplinary action from the medical regulatory body for his handling of the matter.As for Ms Parvin Din, the magistrate said, nothing she had done or not done was enough to find her responsible for Mr Veevers death.And yet, despite the finality of the ruling, the end result is a body that has remained in a mortuary for more than 11 years is still suspended in legal uncertainty, caught between siblings with irreconcilable wishes.It is not a choice either side would willingly make.The sons have all along argued that their father was a British citizen and should be buried in the UK, while his second wife and her daughters have wanted him to be reburied in Kenya.The court acknowledged that determining Mr Veevers final resting place was nerve-racking because of the absence of formal legislative provisions to guide burial disputes in Kenya.It was also a tough decision because Mr Veevers did not ascribe to a specific custom, and no will had been presented to show that he wished to exit the world in a certain way.Nor was there any evidence to show that he had a sour relationship with any of his close family members so as to exclude anyone from claiming his body.The magistrate stated that he would not wish to interfere with who would be given the body but urged them to seek legal redress from another forum. He also noted that the dispute over inheritance was still pending in another court.Mr Veevers long wait for eternal peace will not be over any time soon.\n\nThe Islamic burial, done quickly according to tradition, further raised suspicions from his sons, who said their father was not Muslim and had been buried under a false name.\n\nThe brothers, Richard and Philip, were in court for some of the inquest that took place over a 10-year period.According to the court documents, Richard Veevers questioned why their father was being buried as a Muslim yet he was a Christian and he was told that if buried in an open cemetery, people would dig him up and steal gold from his body.Ms Parvin Din testified that Mr Veevers had converted to Islam.The brothers also accused Ms Parvin Din and her daughters of poisoning their father, so that they could inherit his multimillion-dollar portfolio  which they vehemently denied. A further complication is that there does not appear to have been a will.Unconvinced by the circumstances surrounding his death, the sons filed an application for the exhumation of their fathers body and a formal investigation into the cause of death.A court order for exhumation was granted on 28 April 2013. However, the body was not dug up until 31 January 2014  more than nine months later.The lawyer representing the sons has blamed the delay on the opposing side, citing repeated frustrations that stalled the process.By the time the exhumation could happen, the body had significantly decomposed.In the final ruling this week, the magistrate said that due to the level of its decomposition at the time of exhumation, it was too hard to say what had led to his death.The cause of death of the deceased remains unknown and as such nobody can be called to answer to any charge, he said.Over the years, the case has passed through the hands of numerous magistrates and judges, all trying to weave through the haze of unanswered questions and delays, to find the elusive truth.The magistrate, Mr Odhiambo, noted that when it first began, he was just starting out his legal practice and would read about it in the newspapers, with no idea that almost a decade later I would be presiding over the case.In January last year, the inquest had neared its end  after years of hearings, a magistrate ruled that Mr Veevers death was not suspicious.However, it was soon reopened after his sons successfully challenged the ruling at the High Court.

Two other pathologists in the case did not find any traces of the toxic substance in their samples.The experts showed to us that there could be different interpretations about a subject [such] that the lay person is left wondering what to believe, Mr Odhiambo said.He said a lot of things had happened soon after Mr Veevers death, but it was not possible to determine whether the acts of commission and omission by different parties in the case could be tied to the cause of death.He suggested that the parties ought to have handled the matter differently.The doctor who first attended to Mr Veevers should have advised Ms Parvin Din to report the death to the authorities and insisted on a post-mortem, he said.Dr Salim Omars failure to do so, he observed, had contributed to the suspicions surrounding the circumstances of the death. The doctor has since faced disciplinary action from the medical regulatory body for his handling of the matter.As for Ms Parvin Din, the magistrate said, nothing she had done or not done was enough to find her responsible for Mr Veevers death.And yet, despite the finality of the ruling, the end result is a body that has remained in a mortuary for more than 11 years is still suspended in legal uncertainty, caught between siblings with irreconcilable wishes.It is not a choice either side would willingly make.The sons have all along argued that their father was a British citizen and should be buried in the UK, while his second wife and her daughters have wanted him to be reburied in Kenya.The court acknowledged that determining Mr Veevers final resting place was nerve-racking because of the absence of formal legislative provisions to guide burial disputes in Kenya.It was also a tough decision because Mr Veevers did not ascribe to a specific custom, and no will had been presented to show that he wished to exit the world in a certain way.Nor was there any evidence to show that he had a sour relationship with any of his close family members so as to exclude anyone from claiming his body.The magistrate stated that he would not wish to interfere with who would be given the body but urged them to seek legal redress from another forum.
