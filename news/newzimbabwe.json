            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZIMBABWE Catholic Bishops Conference (ZCBC) members have expressed concern over the governments fixation on the Third Term debate while bread-and-butter concerns like business closures, and crippling taxes threaten to plunge the nation further into crisis.\n\nZanu PF is currently facing internal divisions, with one faction supporting President Emmerson Mnangagwas third term and another demanding adherence to constitutional limits.\n\nThese internal divisions have spilled into the public domain, weakening the ruling partys unity; several government ministers and parliamentarians are supporting the move to disregard the constitution and extend Mnangagwas rule until 2030.\n\nIn a Lenten Pastoral Letter dated March 3, 2025, ZCBC members said they are worried about the countrys struggling economy as politicians focus on non-essential issues.\n\nWe are all worried about the situation in the country. Politically, instead of focusing on bread-and-butter issues, we are caught up in distractions such as the Third term conversations. Something that has brought with it divisions and unnecessary diversions from the things that do matter.\n\nEconomically, we are not faring well. Businesses are closing, and many people are losing their jobs. The few who are still lucky to be working are burdened under the regime of taxes.\n\nCorruption is rampant and seems tobe out of control. At the rate at which it is taking place, cutting through various sectors, the nation isdoomed. One wonders why the corrupt seemuncensoredand even rewarded whilsthemorrhagingthe nation, the letter reads.\n\nThe bishops criticized economic policies for favoring the elite while most Zimbabweans struggle with poverty.\n\nIt must be said that in our society there is an ever-widening gap between the poor and the rich.\n\nFew individuals seem to be benefiting from the wealth of the nation. We would like to remind our people that Poverty in the world today is not simply a misfortune, bad luck or inevitable -the result of laziness or ignorance or a lack of development. Poverty in the world today is the direct result of political and economic policies of governments, political parties, and big business.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nA local workers rights group has called on the National Social Security Authority (NSSA) to consider processing early payments for workers in the wake of rampant job cuts.\n\nAccording to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the unemployment rate is around 20%, with records showing that formal employment has been depleting over the years, leaving many citizens in the informal sector where salaries are often low.\n\nDespite government efforts to ease the situation, formalisation continues to spiral out of control, creating untold carnage which has forced several companies to fold operations, leaving many jobless.\n\nThe Commercial Workers Union of Zimbabwe (CWUZ) General Secretary, Cuthbert Chikwekwete, implored NSSA to adjust its operations in line with obtaining trends on the job markets.\n\nThe way in which NSSA is operating urgently needs to be transformed in line with job market dynamics. Currently, most workers in our sector and Zimbabwe in general are losing their jobs way before the retirement age, he said.\n\nThe CWUZ leader said that due to the pressing situation and the rampant job cuts, very few of those who lose their jobs will manage to secure new employment, with some not even getting a job again until they surpass retirement age.\n\nIt is therefore against this background that we implore relevant authorities to urgently compel NSSA to consider processing payouts earlier rather than waiting for one to reach the retirement age. This will go a long way to assist the affected workers to raise funds and venture into other self-sustaining projects, he said.\n\nChikwekwete said the situation bedevilling axed workers is very dire with risks of exposing such workers to chronic and mental health illnesses.\n\nNSSAs intervention by processing timely payments will go a long way to alleviate such kinds of negative impacts, he added.\n\n",

It is unfortunate that they are in a foreign land as we speak. You look at Walter Mzembihe is harmless. He is pure. If they can allow them back into their country, it will be a blessing for your nation. There is nothing wrong with that. No one is powerful besides the power that you give them, said Makandiwa.\n\nWhen Robert Mugabe was deposed, Mzembi and Kasukuwere were brought before the courts, accused of corruption during their time in the previous cabinet. They, however, dismissed the allegations as a political witch hunt.\n\nMakandiwa claimed that he had warned Mugabe during his presidency that he would be deposed and that Mnangagwa would succeed him.\n\nThe cleric further urged Zimbabweans living abroad, who have sought greener pastures due to the countrys economic challenges, to return home.\n\nZimbabwe is full of blessings. Bring your children who are in the diaspora. They are blessings that have left, Makandiwa added.\n\nMakandiwa is no stranger to dabbling in the countrys politics. In 2023, he invited Mnangagwa to his church, where he publicly endorsed him.\n\n",

In comparison, Triangle fielded veteran players who are past their prime, such as Ali Sadiki and Thabani Kamusoko, but managed to frustrate the Mabvuku side.\n\nNdiraya pleaded for more time for Scottland to gel and play as a unit in the PSL after a busy signing spree.\n\nDespite having a galaxy of stars in our team, I think it is important to understand that football is a process. You may buy whoever you want from the market, but at the end, the players have to understand each other and play as a team in the long run.\n\nSo that it is a process. It does not happen in one day. With more games, the team will start to play as a team. At the moment, we are not a team yet, said Ndiraya.\n\nOn Friday, Ndiraya fielded last years Soccer Stars of the Year finalists, Lynoth Chikuhwa, Walter Musona, and Tymon Machope. Khama Billiat was omitted due to injury.\n\nThe quartet scored a combined 51 goals last season. Such is the quality of the arsenal that Ndiraya has at his disposal.\n\nIt is the signings that have made Scottland favourites to clinch the 2025 PSL title among bookmakers.\n\nNdiraya said there is still a long way to go before his team starts to deliver statement performances.\n\nWith more time on the pitch, at training we will come good. We will start to play as a team and be where we are expected to play. We are building a team. Putting a galaxy of players together is one thing, and making them play as a team is another.\n\nIt is a process, and we are very patient. Hopefully, after a few games, we can then start to play the way we want and the way that everyone will understand. The expectation is for the team to win 5-0.

His absence has sparked a wave of concern and uncertainty, and were committed to support his loved ones until the couple is found, she said.\n\nWe stand in solidarity, demanding answers and action to ensure Aserie and Zodwas safe return and reunification with their families and friends. Our thoughts are with Aserie and Zodwas loved ones during this challenging time, and well continue to advocate for their safe return, until they are back home.\n\nSouth African-based Turkish journalist Turkmen Terzi who is Ndlovus friend told IOL that he has been thrust into distressby the news of Ndlovus disappearance.\n\nAserie is not just a journalist, he is a father, a husband, and a son. Zodwa, too, has a family anxiously waiting for her. Their absence is a painful reminder of the risks we face in this field. I understand Aseries situation all too well, as I have personally faced threats from Turkish authorities due to my reporting on President Recep Tayyip Erdoans corruption and the unresolved mysteries surrounding the July 15, 2016, coup attempt. Under Erdoans rule, 170 media houses have been shut down, and critical journalists have been silenced, said Terzi.\n\nWhile I deeply value South Africas media freedom, the high crime rate poses significant dangers, and kidnappings have become alarmingly frequent. Although we do not yet know what happened to Aserie and Zodwa, this tragedy underscores the urgent need for greater security measures to protect journalists. Media practitioners must remain vigilant, and law enforcement must ensure our safety.\n\nMedia specialist Lazarus Tshwari also added his voice: I am worried about Aseries mysterious disappearance, no one can just disappear like that, one in Gauteng and his partner in Mpumalanga. This is very concerning. Im praying for their safe return.\n\nTelevision news reporter, Princess Siziba told IOL that the disappearance of Ndlovu and Mdhluli has rekindled memories of her tough experiences while gathering news.\n\nEvery time his disappearance crosses my mind, l try to brush it away because l know if he is kept in captivity ,l know what he is going through cos l have been there and its something l dont wish on anyone. l spoke to Aserie a week before his disappearance. He was joking about me taking pictures of him regularly, yet I do not send the pictures to him. Such a humble person.\n\nI personally plead for his safe return, said Siziba.\n\nOn the other hand, veteran journalist and photographer, Diana Chiyangwa also pleaded for the safe return of the missing couple.\n\nThe disappearance of Aserie Ndlovu and his partner comes three months after I attended and participated in the African Investigative Journalism Conference in Wits University. Journalism is not a crime was our motto, it resonates with the couples disappearance and I believe they chose this career to tell peoples stories and their everyday experiences, she said.\n\nTheir disappearance raises concerns if the targeting of journalists is a new trend. We have seen it happening in Zimbabwe and in other countries in the Southern African region.We plead for the couples safe return. We also plead with SAPS to add more resources to find Aserie and his partner.\n\nOn Sunday, family representative Vusi Mahlasela appealed to anyone that can assist to help find Ndlovu and his partner.Mahlasela also urged people to also pray for the missing couple.\n\nHave positive prayers, more so that the couple can come back home safely. We are not going to talk about them as past tense. We have to be positive and be positive.\n\nThinking is like a constant prayer. Lets think positive. And that we will be able to see them. All the family is asking for is help from all sides, all corners, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe Deaf Zimbabwe Trust (DZT), a local nonprofit organization dedicated to empowering persons with disabilities, particularly within the deaf community, is facing a severe funding crisis that has led to the suspension of several key programs.\n\nThis crisis follows a US Executive Order by President Donald Trump that cut foreign aid.\n\nIn a statement, DZT revealed that the reduction in funding has forced the organization to cut staffing levels and decrease operational capacity.\n\nThe organization has experienced a substantial reduction in funding, which has directly affected staffing levels and overall operational capacity. The cessation of funding has led to the suspension of crucial programs, including entrepreneurship training and informal apprenticeship opportunities.\n\nThese programs were essential for fostering skills development and providing pathways to financial inclusion for these young people. The halt in these initiatives not only stifles their potential for economic empowerment but also affects their confidence and self-esteem.\n\nThe opportunities to equalise opportunities between youths with disabilities and those without disabilities have been lost, reads the statement.\n\nDZT is now actively exploring various options to sustain its operations.\n\nThis includes leveraging technology and community partnerships to continue the momentum built over the years. The passionate team at DZT, comprised of individuals deeply committed to their mission, serves as a driving force to navigate these difficult times.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, DZT aims not only to mitigate the impact of the recent stop work order but also to ensure that their important mission of empowering youths with disabilities continues to thrive. Through resilience and innovation, DZT is determined to create lasting change and improve the lives of those they serve, reads the statement.\n\n",
