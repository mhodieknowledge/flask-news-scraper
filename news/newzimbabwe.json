            "content": "Xinhua\n\nZimbabwean authorities on Wednesday called for sustainable domestic financing to fight against tuberculosis (TB) as external funding declined.\n\nOwen Mugurungi, director of AIDS and TB programs in the Ministry of Health and Child Care, said at a conference in the Zimbabwean capital of Harare that the reduction in global donor funding posed a direct threat to the countrys TB response, and the country needs to explore sustainable domestic financing to respond to the infectious disease.\n\nWe can not build a resilient TB response on unpredictable and external funding alone, Mugurungi said, adding that the situation underscores the urgent need for sustainable financing and domestic investment.\n\nHe noted that Zimbabwe faces a high burden of TB/HIV co-infection and a persistent challenge of drug-resistant TB.\n\nAccording to him, the ministry estimated that approximately 15,000 TB cases were missed last year, and the gap represents the single greatest challenge in the fight against the disease.\n\nOur national TB response is at a crossroads. We have the strategy, we have the evidence, and we have the dedicated workforce. What we need now is the collective will to convert our commitments into concrete action. We must find the missing cases, secure the necessary resources and embrace the innovations that will allow us to end TB in Zimbabwe, Mugurungi said.\n\nSpeaking at the same event, Zimbabwean Health and Child Care Minister Douglas Mombeshora commended Zimbabwe for progress in the fight against the infectious disease.\n\nOur TB response has made real progress. But as we celebrate progress, we must also be honest about the road ahead. TB remains a serious public health challenge and the shifting landscape of global health financing is creating uncertainty for critical programs, he added.\n\n",

Zimbabweans do not panic, we are going to announce the next course of action after this, said Sikhala.\n\nThe recently adopted resolution by the ruling party at its just-ended conference in Mutare, to set legal wheels in motion for President Mnangagwa to stay beyond 2028, has ignited political tensions.\n\nWithin ZANU-PF, a clique backing Vice President Constantino Chiwenga is opposing the move to amend the constitution, rooting for the former army general to succeed Mnangagwa.\n\nWorld Council of Churches (WCC) programmes director, Kenneth Mtata, said the move to extend Mnangagwas term will have ripple effects on the countrys position in the global community.\n\nThe proposal to extend the presidential term will hurt Zimbabwe at many levels. Here are five main reasons\n\nFirst, it will undermine all the hard work of international re-engagement pursued since 2017. It will signal to global partners that Zimbabwe cannot be trusted to honour its own constitutional and democratic commitments.\n\nSecond, it will jeopardise the ongoing debt restructuring efforts. Third, this extension will discourage investment. Recently, Forbes magazine is said to have identified Zimbabwe as one of the most attractive tourist destinations. Investors would be wary of systems that change rules to suit political convenience. Policy inconsistency and instability will scare away the very capital needed for national economic recovery.\n\nFourth, the term extension will shatter the fragile social trust that had begun to form after years of political violence. Coercive force and intimidation would likely return to our national life in order to enforce such an unpopular measure. This will reopen old wounds and further divide communities once again.\n\nFifth, this decision will remove any chances of the President leaving a positive legacy. He will be classified with all those leaders remembered for clinging to power, rather than those honoured for serving with integrity and stepping aside with dignity, said Mtata.\n\n",

During that time, they contracted occupational diseases such as tuberculosis and silicosis.\n\nThe MoU enables the Tshiamiso Trust to facilitate compensation for former Wenela workers who were employed in the neighbouring country between March 12 1965, and December 10 2019.\n\nTshiamiso Trust Chief Executive Officer, Munyadziwa Kwinda, said the agreement is a turning point for the majority of the former mineworkers and their dependants who have had to endure a long wait.\n\nWe are honoured to mark this moment in partnership with the Government of Zimbabwe and NSSA. Thousands of Zimbabwean ex-mineworkers have been waiting for Tshiamiso Trust services to commence so that they can access compensation that they may qualify for.\n\nTodays agreement means they can now lodge their claims and complete the medical assessments required to determine their eligibility for compensation. This is about restoring dignity and delivering on the promise made to the men and families who built the mining industry, said Kwinda.\n\nProspective claimants, however, must meet certain criteria, including providing proof that they suffered from a work-related illness.\n\nDependants of the deceased can claim after providing proof of relationship and a death certificate indicating the cause of death.\n\nThe National Social Security Authority (NSSA), which partnered with Tshiamiso on behalf of the government, said the compensation will bring relief to the former mineworkers and their dependants.\n\nZimbabwe is home to many who spent their working lives in South Africas mines and returned home with illnesses that changed their futures. Through this collaboration, we are ensuring that those who qualify can now access the compensation due to them, closer to where they live.\n\nNSSA remains committed to working with regional partners like Tshiamiso Trust to expand social security and strengthen cross-border protection for our workers, said NSSA Chief Executive Officer Charles Shava.\n\nThe Tshiamiso Trust has already paid R2.4 billion to 25,000 beneficiaries in Lesotho, South Africa, Mozambique, Eswatini, and Botswana.\n\n",

This marks a 511% increase from 2019 levels, a remarkable turnaround in just six years.\n\nThe expansion aligns with Zimbabwes broader strategy to reduce dependence on imports, especially following the global grain price spikes triggered by theRussiaUkraineconflict.\n\nWheatis the countrys second most important cereal after maize, and domestic self-sufficiency is seen as critical to stabilising food prices and strengthening food security.\n\nFocus on export opportunities and market stability\n\nWith domestic needs fully met, Zimbabwe is now seeking export opportunities within the region, particularly in neighboring countries that continue to face wheat shortages.\n\nHowever, Masuka emphasized that local supply remains secure and that the government has taken measures to stabilise pricing and ensure smooth distribution.\n\nThe government has released 6,518 metric tonnes to millers in recent weeks to stabilise supply and pricing levels of wheat products, he said, noting that the Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA) continues to coordinate marketing and distribution to maintain market balance.\n\nDespite the surplus, Zimbabwe will continue importing limited volumes of high-gluten wheat, which is preferred by some millers for specific bread formulations.\n\nCertain millers have indicated that their mills and bread styles require high gluten content wheat not achievable in locally produced wheat, Masuka explained.\n\nAccording to him, as per current policy, such wheat will continue to be imported under existing arrangements, without any additional costs.\n\nThe government is urging registered millers and industry players to collaborate closely with authorities under the AMA framework to ensure a consistent balance between production, demand, and market stability.\n\nZimbabwes wheat success story reflects years of deliberate investment in irrigation infrastructure, farmer training, and private-sector partnerships.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), sub-SaharanAfricastill imports over 80% of its wheat consumption, underscoring Zimbabwes rare achievement in the region.\n\n",
