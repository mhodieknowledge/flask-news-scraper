It can be waived or forfeited where the beneficiary is at fault.\n\nIn dismissing the application, the judges acknowledged the importance of maintaining the integrity of the disciplinary process, warning against setting a precedent that would allow employees to sidestep disciplinary consequences.\n\nIf participants were allowed to pull out of these processes without consequence and subsequently seek a review the whole labour dispute resolution mechanism would face certain collapse, the judgment read.\n\n",

            "content": "The East African\n\nZimbabwes plans to drop the US dollar in five years is already causing jitters in an economy that has suffered nearly two decades of currency volatility and bouts of record hyperinflation.\n\nHarare has set 2030 as the target to stop using the US dollar, which has been the dominant foreign currency for the past 16 years, after it was forced to abandon its own.\n\nZimbabwe first announced on August 6, 2024 that its Cabinet had approved a roadmap to adopt the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) as the sole currency. The gold-backed ZiG was launched last year, the countrys sixth attempt at mooting a stable currency in 25 years.\n\nThe central bank concedes that businesses are nervous about the plan to return to a mono-currency regime, so much that banks are now avoiding long-term lending beyond that date.\n\nJohn Mushayavanhu, Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor, said he would announce a comprehensive de-dollarisation roadmap in November, in what is seen as a desperate attempt to calm nerves.\n\nDr Mushayavanhu said the roadmap would focus on the need to preserve foreign currency accounts and the existing US dollar-denominated contracts, with considerations made to ensure business continuity and certainty.\n\nThe central bank says it is working on modernising the ZiG banknotes with re-designing and producing improved banknotes to increase the acceptance of the new currency.The roadmap will undoubtedly encapsulate the need to maintain the current stability, preserve the foreign currency accounts and existing USD-dominated contracts, Dr Mushayavanhu said as he presented the 2025 mid-term monetary policy statement.\n\nConsideration will always be made to ensure that there is business continuity and certainty.The Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI), the countrys largest business grouping with membership from the manufacturing, trade, transport, information technology, education and professional services, said the success of the de-dollarisation strategy would hinge on controlling inflation.Low levels of inflation will help build trust in the currency, which might also encourage greater usage of ZiG in transactions, CZI said. This could also boost the likelihood of a gradual de-dollarisation process leading to a ZiG mono-currency regime by 2030. The high annual inflation level creates pricing uncertainty, making it difficult for businesses to set prices, forecast costs or even negotiate contracts.\n\nThe team advised the authorities to urgently introduce measures to increase demand for the ZiG and institute other reforms if the de-dollarisation plan is to succeed.The mission emphasised the need to continue strengthening the monetary and foreign currency market framework in line with IMF staff recommendations, said Wojciech Maliszewski, head of the IMF team.\n\nThis should be complemented by measures to enhance the demand for ZiG in the domestic economy- most notably, increasing the share of Treasurys operations (revenues and expenditures) in ZiG. To reduce any uncertainty weighing on financial intermediation, the authorities should provide more clarity on the implications of the transition plan, including clarifying that the use of a mono-currency will be limited to domestic transactions, allowing for bank deposits to remain dominated in both currencies.\n\nOver a year since the introduction of the ZiG, the country is still heavily reliant on the US dollar, with the central bank indicating that only 40 percent of transactions are in local currency.\n\nEconomic analysts say the new currency is being undermined by the same factors that thwarted previous efforts to re-establish a sole currency. These include a lack of confidence in the banking sector and the local economy, as well as the large scale of the unregulated informal economy, which according to the World Bank is the largest in the world.\n\nJohn Lagat, Imara Asset Management CEO, said the ZiG was destined for extinction just like the other currencies before it because it was being rendered irrelevant by the market.There is so little ZiG around  thanks to the very tight monetary policy  that it is easier simply to use US dollar cash or bank cards. We continue to believe that way too much time and energy is spent on dealing with and discussing the ZiG, despite its limited use, that it would be better simply to scrap it and move on, he said.\n\nHe added that the ZiG was largely used in Harare while in the southern parts of the country people favoured the South African rand.On our recent travels around, it would appear that the South African rand is the favoured currency in the southern parts of Zimbabwe, whilst the US dollar is king further north. Indeed, it is only in the capital Harare that the ZiG is used to any extent. The civil servants continue to receive part of their remuneration in ZiG, which they attempt to spend in the formal shops since the formal economy has no use for it.\n\nAccording to the IMF, only four out of 85 countries that were surveyed during the 1980 to 2001 period succeeded in de-dollarisation, which makes Zimbabwes attempt to return to a mono-currency regime an uphill task.\n\nZimbabwe started facing acute currency problems in 1997 when the local dollar crashed dramatically that year after Robert Mugabes regime paid unbudgeted pensions to former fighters of the countrys liberation struggle.\n\nThe crisis deepened when Zimbabwe sent troops to the Democratic Republic of Congo to protect Laurent Kabilas under siege regime.\n\nA chaotic land reform programme that began in the year 2000 proved to be the final nail on the coffin for the local currency as it led to the countrys international isolation and economic collapse.\n\nBy the time Mugabes government abandoned the Zimbabwe dollar in 2009 when the inflation rate peaked at 79.6 billion percent in mid-November. Hyperinflation only ended after the adoption of the US dollar.\n\n",

In 2018, after decades of hiding his sexual orientation, Moyo came out to his family and friends and his parish as gay.\n\nAttitudes to sexual and gender minorities in Zimbabwe are highly conservative. Those found guilty of consensual same-sex sexual activity could face up to one years imprisonment and a fine. The southern African countrys anti-homosexuality law was first introduced by the British during its colonisation of Zimbabwe.\n\nAccording toHuman Dignity Trust, the country has noted consistent reports of discrimination and violence being committed against LGBTQIA+ people in recent years, including assault, sexual violence, harassment, blackmail, and the denial of basic rights and services.\n\nMoyos decision has not been without consequence. News of his sexuality soon went viral (with)people deliberating upon it, he says. There was alsoaprotest at the churchs headquarters.\n\nSays Moyo: They were saying things like this is against our culture. This is against our religion. This is against our lawsThey say it is strange. It is not part of us and did not originate from our own people. (That) its a Western thing. When the noise started, (with) people protesting, you really need people who stand up to say, No, this thing isnotWestern. Its our own thing. It hasalwaysbeen in our midst.\n\nFor Moyo, as with an increasing number of LGBTQIA+ persons across the country, social media is an essential tool in a continued push for a break from the narrative that homosexuality  and queerness, more broadly  is a Western import.\n\nMoyos social media accounts on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X (formerly, Twitter) has a combined following of just under 10 000 people. He also uses Clubhouse for the (weekly) LGBTQIA+ fellowship.\n\nMoyo says he first realised the power of social media during the Covid-19 pandemic. We could not gather as Christians, so we used to worship via social media. I realised that this is a thing that can quickly spread the message to othersI thought of it as a way that my voice can also be heard.\n\nTanatswa Gumbo, communications officer for the countrys largest queer rights organisation, Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe, says LGBTQIA+ people definitely have become more visible on social media. Image: Supplied\n\nTanatswa Gumbo, communications officer for the countrys largest queer rights organisation,Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe (GALZ), says LGBTQIA+ people definitely have become more visible on social media.\n\nLGBTQIA+ persons, particularly activists, have really been visible and have really become more outspoken in terms of challenging conservative attitudes towards LGBTQIA+ people. Especially the claims of homosexuality being un-African; not being Christian, says Gumbo.\n\nResearch conducted by Princess Sibanda and Gibson Ncubefoundthat, for queer Zimbabweans, online spaces represent a powerful act of resistance, a way for queer Zimbabweans to claim their right to exist and express themselves.Its like theyre sending love letters to the world, saying that queer love is just as important and beautiful as any other kind of love.\n\nZimbabwe is, of course, only one of numerous African states to have inherited homophobic laws and attitudes as a result of colonisation. The end of colonial rule has, however, seen some countries (such as Uganda, Nigeria, Kenya and Namibia) place added restrictions on the rights of LGBTQIA+ persons.\n\nGhana is one such country. The West African state inherited its first anti-homosexuality law during British rule.Section 104 of the countrys Criminal Code of 1960  seen largely as an after-effect of the colonial era  carries with it a sentence of up to three years imprisonment for men found guilty of consensual same-sex relations.\n\nGhanas latest anti-LGBT law, thePromotion of Proper Human Sexual Rights and Ghanaian Family Values Bill (commonly known as the Anti-LGBT Bill), is particularly draconian and has been described asbrutal, harsh, and unjust.\n\nIn 2021,Angel Maxine, Ghanas only openly transgender musician and queer rights activist, penned a song, titledKill the Bill, in protest against the Anti-LGBT Bill. In addition to using her music as a tool for awareness-raising, Maxine also relies heavily on social media to try and effect change.\n\nIf social media was availableduring the colonial days, Im sure a lot of people would have been educated by now, and we would (not be in) this era that we are in, Maxine says, in reference to the increasing queerphobic rhetoric sweeping across the continent. Because even though some of us are on social media, we are still living in our colonial days; still carrying the colonial thinking. But there are also people who are using social media who have broken free from this colonialism. In Africa, we have made use of social media positively to educate people.\n\nMaxine is nowliving in Berlin, having fled Ghana as a result of persecution based on her gender identity and her queer rights activism. The distance from her home country makes her rely on social media even more.\n\nSometimes when the grounds become very hard and difficult for us to meet in person, social media is where we can meet. I am currently in Germany, but Im communicating with people in Ghana through social media.\n\nAlex Kofi Donkor, the executive director of LGBT Rights Ghana, says LGBTQIA+ Ghanaians are creating social media content that challenges the narrative that queerness is a Western import. Image:Supplied\n\nAlexKofi Donkoris the founder and executive director of LGBT Rights Ghana. I would say most of the mobilisation and most of the engagement at the initial stages (of establishing LGBT Rights Ghana)] was through social media. Even as of now, most of the mobilisation is done via various social media platforms, says Donkor.\n\nAside from activists utilising social media for policy and attitude reforms, there are also individual members of Ghanas LGBTQIA+ communities who, Donkor says, are putting content out there that challenges the status quo and challenges so many thoughts that Ghanaians have around LGBTQIA+ issuesthat its a Western import.\n\nAs could be expected, given the repressive contexts in which this content is created, there are downsides to proudly sharing pro-LGBTQIA+ content.\n\nA recent example of this was when a queer South African undertook the social media campaign, #ShowGhanaLove. Ostensibly meant as a show of solidarity with queer Ghanaians, the campaign had the opposite effect, as anti-queer politicians used the resultant public outrage to add pressure on the Ghanaian government to expedite the passing of theAnti-LGBT Bill.\n\nSays Donkor: People tend to react quickly when (LGBTQIA+ content) is openly or obviously put out there. People tend to react in a very negative way.\n\nGhanaian human rights activist, Angel Maxine, sees social media as an integral tool in raising awareness. Image: Eemmax Experience\n\nAngel Maxine is nonplussed by negative comments. Social media is a safe space for me, even though the comments and all those things arent 100% safe, it is a safe space for me, she says.\n\nSocial media, she adds, resulted in what she sees as her biggest success as an activist: the collaboration with fellow musicians,Wanlov the Kubolor and Sister Deborah, which led to her song,Wo Fie.\n\nWo Fiemeans your home, Maxine explains. We all come from homes, whether (we are) LGBTQIA or not. A queer person could be your brother, could be your sister. So we just have to love, respect and accept queer people for who they are. Religion is not our culture. The Bible is not our culture. The only culture that has been imported to Africa is hate.\n\nAs to whether she says a point at which she might rely less on social media as a tool for her activism, Maxine says firmly: No, no. I dont think I see that happening.\n\nBack in his home in rural Zimbabwe, Moyo echoes the same sentiment.\n\nYou know, he sighs, to get the church to accept us, we have attended the meetings, the synods, the meetings in the archdiocese, the councils, but it was of no useSo, theres no other way, since we have been blocked on top. So, we are saying this is the time to make our voices heardMaybe changes may comeOur people still believe its a Western influence. A taboo in our culture. Yet, we are saying its our own thing. So, we will keep on fighting, no matter how hard it gets.\n\n* Not his real name\n\n* Carl Collison is a journalist, photographer, filmmaker, and researcher.

He has raised more than 35,000 forcharityas a result.\n\nThe bishop and his dog completed the challenge on Sunday, having averaged a marathon a day across some of Englands wildest terrain  from Edale in the Peak District to Kirk Yetholm just over the Scottish border  with an incline of nearly 40,000 feet.\n\nDr Gainsborough said on Tuesday: Running the equivalent of a marathon a day for ten days was pretty brutal as it is wild and mountainous terrain, and it is quite easy to lose the path.\n\nTo say that he enjoyed the experience would be overstating it, he said, but to have made it through without injury was deeply exhilarating. He said: Jem, who was magnificent throughout, is now enjoying a more sedentary pace in Southfields.\n\nThe Bishop set out on 1 August with an initial target of raising 30,000 to improve education in the diocese of Matabeleland, inZimbabwe, with whichSouthwark dioceseis linked.\n\nHe had been inspired by the children and teachers he met on a visit to the region last year, where many children currently walk up to 10km to get to their nearest school  a dangerous journey which means that many, particularly girls, are unable to attend.\n\nMartinGainsborough/Diocese of SouthwarkCamping out on the Pennine Way\n\nThe money raised will help to build new schools like St Cecilias School in Lupane, which is still under construction, but already offers an education to local children.\n\nSupport along the way included a video, on the fifth day, of the Bishop of Matabeleland, the Rt Revd Cleophas Lunga, outside the cathedral with members of the Mothers Union and senior clergy of his diocese, singing heartily of journeying with Jesus.\n\nBishop Lunga said: We are delighted that you are doing a very good, good thing, not only for your spirit and body, but also for us in Matabeleland. The gifts donated would go a long way to improving the lives of the young people in the villages, he said.\n\nOnline donations have since reached 27,000, with a further 8000 donated offline. The total raised currently stands at 35,389, and further donations are welcome.\n\nDr Gainsborough concluded: I have been amazed how my run has captured peoples imagination  reflected in a huge amount of support and prayers, and incredible generosity in fundraising.\n\nTo be able to make a difference to the lives of children in our link diocese of Matabeleland so they no longer have to walk long distances to school means more than I can say and makes all the pain and heartache worth it.

The passengers were travelling from Gokwe to Chimanimani.\n\nA day later, four people died and 17 were injured on the BinduraShamva Road when a Toyota Hiace tyre burst, sending the overloaded vehicle off the road.\n\nOther fatal crashes included a Toyota Hilux overturning on the MasvingoMbalabala Road on 11 August, killing two, and a ChechecheRimai Road tragedy in which a 16-year-old girl died after falling from a moving sand-laden lorry and being run over.\n\nPedestrians were also victims. In Harare, a man was killed on Delport Road in Hatfield on 12 August after being hit by a Toyota Spade, while another was injured on High Glen Road the previous day.\n\nDespite commending public service operators for cooperation during the period, police urged motorists to service vehicles, avoid speeding, and adhere strictly to road rules.\n\nAbove all, drivers should adhere to all road rules and regulations in order to curb the continuous loss of lives through road traffic accidents, Nyathi said.\n\n",
