            "content": "By Julia Evans l Daily Maverick\n\nOn 11 April 2022, Sibongile Mkhize left her shift at a textile factory early, feeling unwell. She had no idea it would be her last normal day for a long time.When I was coming home from work, it was a rainy day, she said. But it didnt seem like anything bad was going to happen. It was just a normal day.After a visit to the clinic, she arrived at her home in Umlazis V Section informal settlement, in the south of Durban. She made tea, took some medicine and went to bed. As she fell asleep, she could hear the rain rattling on the roof, but when you live in a corrugated iron shack, thats normal.Hours later, she woke up to frantic banging on her door, her neighbour yelling: Hey, my sister, you want to die? Are you mad?He pulled her off the bed, and as she stood up, she realised the water had risen to the height of the mattress  up to her hips. Shed been so deeply asleep, she hadnt even noticed the bed was soaked.As she scrambled to pack a suitcase and gather important documents, her neighbour kept urging her out. Realising the water would be too high for her young, short roommate  a family friend  Sibongile hoisted her on to her back as her neighbour pulled her out.Within 10 minutes, her house was covered in water.When the water comes, its like the sea  so fast and so powerful, she said. We started running, and we were crying. If I looked across, people were running, screaming and crying with their children, she said.They tried to reach the nearby Metro Launch Hall, but it, too, was flooded.We were just moving up and down the whole night because everybody was outside. Even the hall was full of water. We couldnt go to the Mega City Mall  the water was flowing too fast, it was very dangerous.Cars were swept away. On her street, many homes vanished entirely.My house was washed away  my furniture, everything. You cant even see where my house was. Only the electricity pole and the mud were left.What Sibongile didnt know at the time  and what a team of international scientists from the World Weather Attribution Group later confirmed  was that the rainfall that destroyed her home on 11 April 2022 formed part of a two-day extreme rainfall event that caused catastrophic flooding and landslides across KwaZulu-Natal and parts of the Eastern Cape.According to the scientists, this extreme rainfall over 11 and 12 April  the most intense two-day total recorded in the region  was made about twice as likely by human-caused climate change.Using climate models and weather records, the researchers found that before the world warmed by 1.2C, a rainfall event of that magnitude would have been expected only once every 40 years. Now, such an event is likely to happen about once every 20 years. They also found that climate change made the rainfall 4%-8% more intense than it would have been in a cooler world.What made it worse was where the rain fell  in low-lying, poorly drained, densely populated informal settlements such as Sibongiles.We as the victims are not the cause of the floods or climate change, said Mkhize.Theyre always putting the blame on us, living in informal settlements. We must stop blaming the victims.For three days after the flood, Sibongile survived through the kindness of friends and strangers. She had fled in soaked pyjamas and initially used a plastic bag to cover herself until someone gave her a skirt, T-shirt and food.We couldnt sleep properly, because we were having the nightmares, she said.The municipality eventually relocated her and others to Yellowwood Park Civic Hall, where men, women and children slept on foam mattresses with no privacy.Some people were drinking, some were fighting. You cant sleep properly.Despite the trauma, she returned to work in borrowed clothes and safety boots, her only remaining shoes. After three months, disaster management said there was no more funding, leaving residents to rely on church and community donations, even as newborns cried from hunger.She stayed in the hall for nine months before being moved to a flat in town, where she now lives with her three children. But the building is overcrowded, infested with bedbugs and rats, and she was allowed to bring only her clothes and pots.Its very hard to rebuild what youve lost, I wont lie to you, she said.Im always losing hope. The delays, the broken promises  they dont bring back proper houses that restore our dignity.Sibongile was one of more than 40,000 people displaced by the April 2022 floodsthe deadliest in South African history. More than 400 people died. Roads, bridges and entire communities were washed away. The storm was declared a national state of disaster.A crisis beyond one stormThis week, the State of the Climate in Africa 2024 report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) was released, and reflected what Sibongile and thousands of others lived through; extreme weather and climate change are intensifying hunger, insecurity and displacement across Africa, affecting every facet of socioeconomic development.The State of the Climate in Africa report reflects the urgent and escalating realities of climate change across the continent, said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.It also reveals a stark pattern of extreme weather events, with some countries grappling with exceptional flooding caused by excessive rainfall and others enduring persistent droughts and water scarcity.Hottest decade on recordAccording to the WMO, 2024 was either the warmest or second-warmest year recorded in Africa, depending on the dataset. The past decade, as a whole, has been the hottest since records began. The continents average surface temperature last year was 0.86C above the 1991-2020 average, with North Africa warming the fastest  1.28C above the same baseline.This temperature rise is not abstract. It is disrupting farming, labour, health, education and economies.Impacts on agriculture and food securityThe 2024 El Nio-linked drought caused a 16% drop in cereal yields across southern Africa, with Zambia and Zimbabwe hit hardest, losing 43% and 50% of crops respectively. Malawi and Mozambique also saw declines, while South Africa faced significantly below-average harvests, including a maize yield drop of about five million tons. Despite this, overall national agricultural production was generally favourable.While South Africas domestic supply remained sufficient, export shortfalls forced countries such as Zambia and Malawi to import maize, causing temporary price spikes, within global norms.Peter Johnston, a climate scientist at the University of Cape Town who specialises in agriculture and water-related activities, explained to Daily Maverick that South African farmers have shown resilience during recent El Nio events, but the 2024/25 season has been abnormal  late rains, mid-season drought and prolonged wet conditions delayed harvests and complicated drying.He said, We cant just say, oh, its El Nio or La Nia anymore. Nothing seems typical now.Floods and cyclonesIn 2024, southern Africa faced its worst drought in decades, with Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe declaring national disasters due to severe crop failures and water shortages.Meanwhile, East Africa experienced deadly floods from March to May, displacing more than 700,000 people in countries including Kenya, Tanzania and Burundi. West and Central Africa also suffered devastating floods affecting more than four million people.In South Africa, severe storms in June caused flooding, tornadoes and infrastructure damage along the eastern coast, particularly in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, resulting in fatalities and displacement. Since losing her home in 2022, Mkhize has been supporting her community through these recurring floods.How can climate change cause both flooding and drought?The simple answer is that temperatures are rising faster than they have in the geological past, Johnston explained. Because this heating is sudden and ongoing, we now have a more energetic atmosphere. He compared it with kids on a sugar high  normally calm, but suddenly uncontrollable with excess energy.This surge in atmospheric energy triggers several key changes:Increased evaporation and condensation: Higher temperatures cause more water to evaporate from oceans, lakes and soil. This moisture then condenses into clouds, fuelling heavier, more intense rainfall.Stronger winds and sharper pressure gradients: The differences in temperature and pressure become more pronounced, making weather systems more powerful and volatile.More extreme rainfall events: Johnston noted, You may get all that rainfall in one or two days, which can overwhelm drainage systems and cause flooding.At the same time, droughts are becoming more severe.A drought isnt in isolation, Johnston said.It happens because of pressure systems that cause dry weather. Now, those dry-weather systems are also intensified, making droughts more severe.This amplifies dry conditions, leading to longer, harsher droughts.Johnston emphasised that climate change didnt mean rain or drought everywhere, but it intensified natural wet and dry cycles. Some areas face extreme flooding, others worsening droughts  both driven by the same growing atmospheric energy.Digital solutions and early warningsWhile the challenges are immense, the WMO report notes that digital transformation is helping African countries improve weather forecasts and early warning systems.They note that the South African Weather Service (Saws), which is a member of WMO, has also integrated AI-based forecasting tools and modern radar systems for effective and timely weather predictions.But while these are important steps, the report stresses that much more is needed: more investment in digital infrastructure and capacity building, stronger data stewardship and sharing frameworks and improved equitable access and inclusive service.This is reflected in the fact that many people, including Mkhize, didnt know these floods were happening  despite Saws sending out warnings  due to internet access issues, climate literacy and communication issues.That gap is evident in Sibongile Mkhizes story. Although the South African Weather Service issued warnings ahead of the 2022 floods, she and many others never received them  a result of limited internet access, poor climate literacy and weak communication channels in informal settlements.Saws confirms it has incorporated AI into the forecasting models process, in post-processing, at the output and data assimilation phase.AI assists in enhancing model capabilities for improved forecasts, data interpolation in areas where theres no observation infrastructure, and enhanced resolution to assist in picking up small-scale features such as convective severe storms.To reach communities who might not have internet, we use radio (community, commercial and public) and work with disaster management authorities at all levels, including provincial, district and local levels, Saws said.\n\nOn 11 April 2022, Sibongile Mkhize left her shift at a textile factory early, feeling unwell.

It is disrupting farming, labour, health, education and economies.Impacts on agriculture and food securityThe 2024 El Nio-linked drought caused a 16% drop in cereal yields across southern Africa, with Zambia and Zimbabwe hit hardest, losing 43% and 50% of crops respectively. Malawi and Mozambique also saw declines, while South Africa faced significantly below-average harvests, including a maize yield drop of about five million tons. Despite this, overall national agricultural production was generally favourable.While South Africas domestic supply remained sufficient, export shortfalls forced countries such as Zambia and Malawi to import maize, causing temporary price spikes, within global norms.Peter Johnston, a climate scientist at the University of Cape Town who specialises in agriculture and water-related activities, explained to Daily Maverick that South African farmers have shown resilience during recent El Nio events, but the 2024/25 season has been abnormal  late rains, mid-season drought and prolonged wet conditions delayed harvests and complicated drying.He said, We cant just say, oh, its El Nio or La Nia anymore. Nothing seems typical now.Floods and cyclonesIn 2024, southern Africa faced its worst drought in decades, with Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe declaring national disasters due to severe crop failures and water shortages.Meanwhile, East Africa experienced deadly floods from March to May, displacing more than 700,000 people in countries including Kenya, Tanzania and Burundi. West and Central Africa also suffered devastating floods affecting more than four million people.In South Africa, severe storms in June caused flooding, tornadoes and infrastructure damage along the eastern coast, particularly in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, resulting in fatalities and displacement. Since losing her home in 2022, Mkhize has been supporting her community through these recurring floods.How can climate change cause both flooding and drought?The simple answer is that temperatures are rising faster than they have in the geological past, Johnston explained. Because this heating is sudden and ongoing, we now have a more energetic atmosphere. He compared it with kids on a sugar high  normally calm, but suddenly uncontrollable with excess energy.This surge in atmospheric energy triggers several key changes:Increased evaporation and condensation: Higher temperatures cause more water to evaporate from oceans, lakes and soil. This moisture then condenses into clouds, fuelling heavier, more intense rainfall.Stronger winds and sharper pressure gradients: The differences in temperature and pressure become more pronounced, making weather systems more powerful and volatile.More extreme rainfall events: Johnston noted, You may get all that rainfall in one or two days, which can overwhelm drainage systems and cause flooding.At the same time, droughts are becoming more severe.A drought isnt in isolation, Johnston said.It happens because of pressure systems that cause dry weather. Now, those dry-weather systems are also intensified, making droughts more severe.This amplifies dry conditions, leading to longer, harsher droughts.Johnston emphasised that climate change didnt mean rain or drought everywhere, but it intensified natural wet and dry cycles. Some areas face extreme flooding, others worsening droughts  both driven by the same growing atmospheric energy.Digital solutions and early warningsWhile the challenges are immense, the WMO report notes that digital transformation is helping African countries improve weather forecasts and early warning systems.They note that the South African Weather Service (Saws), which is a member of WMO, has also integrated AI-based forecasting tools and modern radar systems for effective and timely weather predictions.But while these are important steps, the report stresses that much more is needed: more investment in digital infrastructure and capacity building, stronger data stewardship and sharing frameworks and improved equitable access and inclusive service.This is reflected in the fact that many people, including Mkhize, didnt know these floods were happening  despite Saws sending out warnings  due to internet access issues, climate literacy and communication issues.That gap is evident in Sibongile Mkhizes story. Although the South African Weather Service issued warnings ahead of the 2022 floods, she and many others never received them  a result of limited internet access, poor climate literacy and weak communication channels in informal settlements.Saws confirms it has incorporated AI into the forecasting models process, in post-processing, at the output and data assimilation phase.AI assists in enhancing model capabilities for improved forecasts, data interpolation in areas where theres no observation infrastructure, and enhanced resolution to assist in picking up small-scale features such as convective severe storms.To reach communities who might not have internet, we use radio (community, commercial and public) and work with disaster management authorities at all levels, including provincial, district and local levels, Saws said.\n\nHours later, she woke up to frantic banging on her door, her neighbour yelling: Hey, my sister, you want to die? Are you mad?\n\nHe pulled her off the bed, and as she stood up, she realised the water had risen to the height of the mattress  up to her hips. Shed been so deeply asleep, she hadnt even noticed the bed was soaked.As she scrambled to pack a suitcase and gather important documents, her neighbour kept urging her out. Realising the water would be too high for her young, short roommate  a family friend  Sibongile hoisted her on to her back as her neighbour pulled her out.Within 10 minutes, her house was covered in water.When the water comes, its like the sea  so fast and so powerful, she said. We started running, and we were crying. If I looked across, people were running, screaming and crying with their children, she said.They tried to reach the nearby Metro Launch Hall, but it, too, was flooded.We were just moving up and down the whole night because everybody was outside. Even the hall was full of water. We couldnt go to the Mega City Mall  the water was flowing too fast, it was very dangerous.Cars were swept away. On her street, many homes vanished entirely.My house was washed away  my furniture, everything. You cant even see where my house was. Only the electricity pole and the mud were left.What Sibongile didnt know at the time  and what a team of international scientists from the World Weather Attribution Group later confirmed  was that the rainfall that destroyed her home on 11 April 2022 formed part of a two-day extreme rainfall event that caused catastrophic flooding and landslides across KwaZulu-Natal and parts of the Eastern Cape.According to the scientists, this extreme rainfall over 11 and 12 April  the most intense two-day total recorded in the region  was made about twice as likely by human-caused climate change.Using climate models and weather records, the researchers found that before the world warmed by 1.2C, a rainfall event of that magnitude would have been expected only once every 40 years. Now, such an event is likely to happen about once every 20 years. They also found that climate change made the rainfall 4%-8% more intense than it would have been in a cooler world.What made it worse was where the rain fell  in low-lying, poorly drained, densely populated informal settlements such as Sibongiles.We as the victims are not the cause of the floods or climate change, said Mkhize.Theyre always putting the blame on us, living in informal settlements. We must stop blaming the victims.For three days after the flood, Sibongile survived through the kindness of friends and strangers. She had fled in soaked pyjamas and initially used a plastic bag to cover herself until someone gave her a skirt, T-shirt and food.We couldnt sleep properly, because we were having the nightmares, she said.The municipality eventually relocated her and others to Yellowwood Park Civic Hall, where men, women and children slept on foam mattresses with no privacy.Some people were drinking, some were fighting. You cant sleep properly.Despite the trauma, she returned to work in borrowed clothes and safety boots, her only remaining shoes. After three months, disaster management said there was no more funding, leaving residents to rely on church and community donations, even as newborns cried from hunger.She stayed in the hall for nine months before being moved to a flat in town, where she now lives with her three children. But the building is overcrowded, infested with bedbugs and rats, and she was allowed to bring only her clothes and pots.Its very hard to rebuild what youve lost, I wont lie to you, she said.Im always losing hope. The delays, the broken promises  they dont bring back proper houses that restore our dignity.Sibongile was one of more than 40,000 people displaced by the April 2022 floodsthe deadliest in South African history. More than 400 people died. Roads, bridges and entire communities were washed away. The storm was declared a national state of disaster.A crisis beyond one stormThis week, the State of the Climate in Africa 2024 report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) was released, and reflected what Sibongile and thousands of others lived through; extreme weather and climate change are intensifying hunger, insecurity and displacement across Africa, affecting every facet of socioeconomic development.The State of the Climate in Africa report reflects the urgent and escalating realities of climate change across the continent, said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.It also reveals a stark pattern of extreme weather events, with some countries grappling with exceptional flooding caused by excessive rainfall and others enduring persistent droughts and water scarcity.Hottest decade on recordAccording to the WMO, 2024 was either the warmest or second-warmest year recorded in Africa, depending on the dataset.

The storm was declared a national state of disaster.A crisis beyond one stormThis week, the State of the Climate in Africa 2024 report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) was released, and reflected what Sibongile and thousands of others lived through; extreme weather and climate change are intensifying hunger, insecurity and displacement across Africa, affecting every facet of socioeconomic development.The State of the Climate in Africa report reflects the urgent and escalating realities of climate change across the continent, said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.It also reveals a stark pattern of extreme weather events, with some countries grappling with exceptional flooding caused by excessive rainfall and others enduring persistent droughts and water scarcity.Hottest decade on recordAccording to the WMO, 2024 was either the warmest or second-warmest year recorded in Africa, depending on the dataset. The past decade, as a whole, has been the hottest since records began. The continents average surface temperature last year was 0.86C above the 1991-2020 average, with North Africa warming the fastest  1.28C above the same baseline.This temperature rise is not abstract. It is disrupting farming, labour, health, education and economies.Impacts on agriculture and food securityThe 2024 El Nio-linked drought caused a 16% drop in cereal yields across southern Africa, with Zambia and Zimbabwe hit hardest, losing 43% and 50% of crops respectively. Malawi and Mozambique also saw declines, while South Africa faced significantly below-average harvests, including a maize yield drop of about five million tons. Despite this, overall national agricultural production was generally favourable.While South Africas domestic supply remained sufficient, export shortfalls forced countries such as Zambia and Malawi to import maize, causing temporary price spikes, within global norms.Peter Johnston, a climate scientist at the University of Cape Town who specialises in agriculture and water-related activities, explained to Daily Maverick that South African farmers have shown resilience during recent El Nio events, but the 2024/25 season has been abnormal  late rains, mid-season drought and prolonged wet conditions delayed harvests and complicated drying.He said, We cant just say, oh, its El Nio or La Nia anymore. Nothing seems typical now.Floods and cyclonesIn 2024, southern Africa faced its worst drought in decades, with Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe declaring national disasters due to severe crop failures and water shortages.Meanwhile, East Africa experienced deadly floods from March to May, displacing more than 700,000 people in countries including Kenya, Tanzania and Burundi. West and Central Africa also suffered devastating floods affecting more than four million people.In South Africa, severe storms in June caused flooding, tornadoes and infrastructure damage along the eastern coast, particularly in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, resulting in fatalities and displacement. Since losing her home in 2022, Mkhize has been supporting her community through these recurring floods.How can climate change cause both flooding and drought?The simple answer is that temperatures are rising faster than they have in the geological past, Johnston explained. Because this heating is sudden and ongoing, we now have a more energetic atmosphere. He compared it with kids on a sugar high  normally calm, but suddenly uncontrollable with excess energy.This surge in atmospheric energy triggers several key changes:Increased evaporation and condensation: Higher temperatures cause more water to evaporate from oceans, lakes and soil. This moisture then condenses into clouds, fuelling heavier, more intense rainfall.Stronger winds and sharper pressure gradients: The differences in temperature and pressure become more pronounced, making weather systems more powerful and volatile.More extreme rainfall events: Johnston noted, You may get all that rainfall in one or two days, which can overwhelm drainage systems and cause flooding.At the same time, droughts are becoming more severe.A drought isnt in isolation, Johnston said.It happens because of pressure systems that cause dry weather. Now, those dry-weather systems are also intensified, making droughts more severe.This amplifies dry conditions, leading to longer, harsher droughts.Johnston emphasised that climate change didnt mean rain or drought everywhere, but it intensified natural wet and dry cycles. Some areas face extreme flooding, others worsening droughts  both driven by the same growing atmospheric energy.Digital solutions and early warningsWhile the challenges are immense, the WMO report notes that digital transformation is helping African countries improve weather forecasts and early warning systems.They note that the South African Weather Service (Saws), which is a member of WMO, has also integrated AI-based forecasting tools and modern radar systems for effective and timely weather predictions.But while these are important steps, the report stresses that much more is needed: more investment in digital infrastructure and capacity building, stronger data stewardship and sharing frameworks and improved equitable access and inclusive service.This is reflected in the fact that many people, including Mkhize, didnt know these floods were happening  despite Saws sending out warnings  due to internet access issues, climate literacy and communication issues.That gap is evident in Sibongile Mkhizes story. Although the South African Weather Service issued warnings ahead of the 2022 floods, she and many others never received them  a result of limited internet access, poor climate literacy and weak communication channels in informal settlements.Saws confirms it has incorporated AI into the forecasting models process, in post-processing, at the output and data assimilation phase.AI assists in enhancing model capabilities for improved forecasts, data interpolation in areas where theres no observation infrastructure, and enhanced resolution to assist in picking up small-scale features such as convective severe storms.To reach communities who might not have internet, we use radio (community, commercial and public) and work with disaster management authorities at all levels, including provincial, district and local levels, Saws said.\n\nWhen the water comes, its like the sea  so fast and so powerful, she said. We started running, and we were crying. If I looked across, people were running, screaming and crying with their children, she said.\n\nThey tried to reach the nearby Metro Launch Hall, but it, too, was flooded.We were just moving up and down the whole night because everybody was outside. Even the hall was full of water. We couldnt go to the Mega City Mall  the water was flowing too fast, it was very dangerous.Cars were swept away. On her street, many homes vanished entirely.My house was washed away  my furniture, everything. You cant even see where my house was. Only the electricity pole and the mud were left.What Sibongile didnt know at the time  and what a team of international scientists from the World Weather Attribution Group later confirmed  was that the rainfall that destroyed her home on 11 April 2022 formed part of a two-day extreme rainfall event that caused catastrophic flooding and landslides across KwaZulu-Natal and parts of the Eastern Cape.According to the scientists, this extreme rainfall over 11 and 12 April  the most intense two-day total recorded in the region  was made about twice as likely by human-caused climate change.Using climate models and weather records, the researchers found that before the world warmed by 1.2C, a rainfall event of that magnitude would have been expected only once every 40 years. Now, such an event is likely to happen about once every 20 years. They also found that climate change made the rainfall 4%-8% more intense than it would have been in a cooler world.What made it worse was where the rain fell  in low-lying, poorly drained, densely populated informal settlements such as Sibongiles.We as the victims are not the cause of the floods or climate change, said Mkhize.Theyre always putting the blame on us, living in informal settlements. We must stop blaming the victims.For three days after the flood, Sibongile survived through the kindness of friends and strangers. She had fled in soaked pyjamas and initially used a plastic bag to cover herself until someone gave her a skirt, T-shirt and food.We couldnt sleep properly, because we were having the nightmares, she said.The municipality eventually relocated her and others to Yellowwood Park Civic Hall, where men, women and children slept on foam mattresses with no privacy.Some people were drinking, some were fighting. You cant sleep properly.Despite the trauma, she returned to work in borrowed clothes and safety boots, her only remaining shoes. After three months, disaster management said there was no more funding, leaving residents to rely on church and community donations, even as newborns cried from hunger.She stayed in the hall for nine months before being moved to a flat in town, where she now lives with her three children. But the building is overcrowded, infested with bedbugs and rats, and she was allowed to bring only her clothes and pots.Its very hard to rebuild what youve lost, I wont lie to you, she said.Im always losing hope.

Despite this, overall national agricultural production was generally favourable.While South Africas domestic supply remained sufficient, export shortfalls forced countries such as Zambia and Malawi to import maize, causing temporary price spikes, within global norms.Peter Johnston, a climate scientist at the University of Cape Town who specialises in agriculture and water-related activities, explained to Daily Maverick that South African farmers have shown resilience during recent El Nio events, but the 2024/25 season has been abnormal  late rains, mid-season drought and prolonged wet conditions delayed harvests and complicated drying.He said, We cant just say, oh, its El Nio or La Nia anymore. Nothing seems typical now.Floods and cyclonesIn 2024, southern Africa faced its worst drought in decades, with Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe declaring national disasters due to severe crop failures and water shortages.Meanwhile, East Africa experienced deadly floods from March to May, displacing more than 700,000 people in countries including Kenya, Tanzania and Burundi. West and Central Africa also suffered devastating floods affecting more than four million people.In South Africa, severe storms in June caused flooding, tornadoes and infrastructure damage along the eastern coast, particularly in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, resulting in fatalities and displacement. Since losing her home in 2022, Mkhize has been supporting her community through these recurring floods.How can climate change cause both flooding and drought?The simple answer is that temperatures are rising faster than they have in the geological past, Johnston explained. Because this heating is sudden and ongoing, we now have a more energetic atmosphere. He compared it with kids on a sugar high  normally calm, but suddenly uncontrollable with excess energy.This surge in atmospheric energy triggers several key changes:Increased evaporation and condensation: Higher temperatures cause more water to evaporate from oceans, lakes and soil. This moisture then condenses into clouds, fuelling heavier, more intense rainfall.Stronger winds and sharper pressure gradients: The differences in temperature and pressure become more pronounced, making weather systems more powerful and volatile.More extreme rainfall events: Johnston noted, You may get all that rainfall in one or two days, which can overwhelm drainage systems and cause flooding.At the same time, droughts are becoming more severe.A drought isnt in isolation, Johnston said.It happens because of pressure systems that cause dry weather. Now, those dry-weather systems are also intensified, making droughts more severe.This amplifies dry conditions, leading to longer, harsher droughts.Johnston emphasised that climate change didnt mean rain or drought everywhere, but it intensified natural wet and dry cycles. Some areas face extreme flooding, others worsening droughts  both driven by the same growing atmospheric energy.Digital solutions and early warningsWhile the challenges are immense, the WMO report notes that digital transformation is helping African countries improve weather forecasts and early warning systems.They note that the South African Weather Service (Saws), which is a member of WMO, has also integrated AI-based forecasting tools and modern radar systems for effective and timely weather predictions.But while these are important steps, the report stresses that much more is needed: more investment in digital infrastructure and capacity building, stronger data stewardship and sharing frameworks and improved equitable access and inclusive service.This is reflected in the fact that many people, including Mkhize, didnt know these floods were happening  despite Saws sending out warnings  due to internet access issues, climate literacy and communication issues.That gap is evident in Sibongile Mkhizes story. Although the South African Weather Service issued warnings ahead of the 2022 floods, she and many others never received them  a result of limited internet access, poor climate literacy and weak communication channels in informal settlements.Saws confirms it has incorporated AI into the forecasting models process, in post-processing, at the output and data assimilation phase.AI assists in enhancing model capabilities for improved forecasts, data interpolation in areas where theres no observation infrastructure, and enhanced resolution to assist in picking up small-scale features such as convective severe storms.To reach communities who might not have internet, we use radio (community, commercial and public) and work with disaster management authorities at all levels, including provincial, district and local levels, Saws said.\n\nMy house was washed away  my furniture, everything. You cant even see where my house was. Only the electricity pole and the mud were left.\n\nWhat Sibongile didnt know at the time  and what a team of international scientists from the World Weather Attribution Group later confirmed  was that the rainfall that destroyed her home on 11 April 2022 formed part of a two-day extreme rainfall event that caused catastrophic flooding and landslides across KwaZulu-Natal and parts of the Eastern Cape.According to the scientists, this extreme rainfall over 11 and 12 April  the most intense two-day total recorded in the region  was made about twice as likely by human-caused climate change.Using climate models and weather records, the researchers found that before the world warmed by 1.2C, a rainfall event of that magnitude would have been expected only once every 40 years. Now, such an event is likely to happen about once every 20 years. They also found that climate change made the rainfall 4%-8% more intense than it would have been in a cooler world.What made it worse was where the rain fell  in low-lying, poorly drained, densely populated informal settlements such as Sibongiles.We as the victims are not the cause of the floods or climate change, said Mkhize.Theyre always putting the blame on us, living in informal settlements. We must stop blaming the victims.For three days after the flood, Sibongile survived through the kindness of friends and strangers. She had fled in soaked pyjamas and initially used a plastic bag to cover herself until someone gave her a skirt, T-shirt and food.We couldnt sleep properly, because we were having the nightmares, she said.The municipality eventually relocated her and others to Yellowwood Park Civic Hall, where men, women and children slept on foam mattresses with no privacy.Some people were drinking, some were fighting. You cant sleep properly.Despite the trauma, she returned to work in borrowed clothes and safety boots, her only remaining shoes. After three months, disaster management said there was no more funding, leaving residents to rely on church and community donations, even as newborns cried from hunger.She stayed in the hall for nine months before being moved to a flat in town, where she now lives with her three children. But the building is overcrowded, infested with bedbugs and rats, and she was allowed to bring only her clothes and pots.Its very hard to rebuild what youve lost, I wont lie to you, she said.Im always losing hope. The delays, the broken promises  they dont bring back proper houses that restore our dignity.Sibongile was one of more than 40,000 people displaced by the April 2022 floodsthe deadliest in South African history. More than 400 people died. Roads, bridges and entire communities were washed away. The storm was declared a national state of disaster.A crisis beyond one stormThis week, the State of the Climate in Africa 2024 report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) was released, and reflected what Sibongile and thousands of others lived through; extreme weather and climate change are intensifying hunger, insecurity and displacement across Africa, affecting every facet of socioeconomic development.The State of the Climate in Africa report reflects the urgent and escalating realities of climate change across the continent, said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.It also reveals a stark pattern of extreme weather events, with some countries grappling with exceptional flooding caused by excessive rainfall and others enduring persistent droughts and water scarcity.Hottest decade on recordAccording to the WMO, 2024 was either the warmest or second-warmest year recorded in Africa, depending on the dataset. The past decade, as a whole, has been the hottest since records began. The continents average surface temperature last year was 0.86C above the 1991-2020 average, with North Africa warming the fastest  1.28C above the same baseline.This temperature rise is not abstract.

We must stop blaming the victims.For three days after the flood, Sibongile survived through the kindness of friends and strangers. She had fled in soaked pyjamas and initially used a plastic bag to cover herself until someone gave her a skirt, T-shirt and food.We couldnt sleep properly, because we were having the nightmares, she said.The municipality eventually relocated her and others to Yellowwood Park Civic Hall, where men, women and children slept on foam mattresses with no privacy.Some people were drinking, some were fighting. You cant sleep properly.Despite the trauma, she returned to work in borrowed clothes and safety boots, her only remaining shoes. After three months, disaster management said there was no more funding, leaving residents to rely on church and community donations, even as newborns cried from hunger.She stayed in the hall for nine months before being moved to a flat in town, where she now lives with her three children. But the building is overcrowded, infested with bedbugs and rats, and she was allowed to bring only her clothes and pots.Its very hard to rebuild what youve lost, I wont lie to you, she said.Im always losing hope. The delays, the broken promises  they dont bring back proper houses that restore our dignity.Sibongile was one of more than 40,000 people displaced by the April 2022 floodsthe deadliest in South African history. More than 400 people died. Roads, bridges and entire communities were washed away. The storm was declared a national state of disaster.A crisis beyond one stormThis week, the State of the Climate in Africa 2024 report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) was released, and reflected what Sibongile and thousands of others lived through; extreme weather and climate change are intensifying hunger, insecurity and displacement across Africa, affecting every facet of socioeconomic development.The State of the Climate in Africa report reflects the urgent and escalating realities of climate change across the continent, said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.It also reveals a stark pattern of extreme weather events, with some countries grappling with exceptional flooding caused by excessive rainfall and others enduring persistent droughts and water scarcity.Hottest decade on recordAccording to the WMO, 2024 was either the warmest or second-warmest year recorded in Africa, depending on the dataset. The past decade, as a whole, has been the hottest since records began. The continents average surface temperature last year was 0.86C above the 1991-2020 average, with North Africa warming the fastest  1.28C above the same baseline.This temperature rise is not abstract. It is disrupting farming, labour, health, education and economies.Impacts on agriculture and food securityThe 2024 El Nio-linked drought caused a 16% drop in cereal yields across southern Africa, with Zambia and Zimbabwe hit hardest, losing 43% and 50% of crops respectively. Malawi and Mozambique also saw declines, while South Africa faced significantly below-average harvests, including a maize yield drop of about five million tons. Despite this, overall national agricultural production was generally favourable.While South Africas domestic supply remained sufficient, export shortfalls forced countries such as Zambia and Malawi to import maize, causing temporary price spikes, within global norms.Peter Johnston, a climate scientist at the University of Cape Town who specialises in agriculture and water-related activities, explained to Daily Maverick that South African farmers have shown resilience during recent El Nio events, but the 2024/25 season has been abnormal  late rains, mid-season drought and prolonged wet conditions delayed harvests and complicated drying.He said, We cant just say, oh, its El Nio or La Nia anymore. Nothing seems typical now.Floods and cyclonesIn 2024, southern Africa faced its worst drought in decades, with Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe declaring national disasters due to severe crop failures and water shortages.Meanwhile, East Africa experienced deadly floods from March to May, displacing more than 700,000 people in countries including Kenya, Tanzania and Burundi. West and Central Africa also suffered devastating floods affecting more than four million people.In South Africa, severe storms in June caused flooding, tornadoes and infrastructure damage along the eastern coast, particularly in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, resulting in fatalities and displacement. Since losing her home in 2022, Mkhize has been supporting her community through these recurring floods.How can climate change cause both flooding and drought?The simple answer is that temperatures are rising faster than they have in the geological past, Johnston explained. Because this heating is sudden and ongoing, we now have a more energetic atmosphere. He compared it with kids on a sugar high  normally calm, but suddenly uncontrollable with excess energy.This surge in atmospheric energy triggers several key changes:Increased evaporation and condensation: Higher temperatures cause more water to evaporate from oceans, lakes and soil. This moisture then condenses into clouds, fuelling heavier, more intense rainfall.Stronger winds and sharper pressure gradients: The differences in temperature and pressure become more pronounced, making weather systems more powerful and volatile.More extreme rainfall events: Johnston noted, You may get all that rainfall in one or two days, which can overwhelm drainage systems and cause flooding.At the same time, droughts are becoming more severe.A drought isnt in isolation, Johnston said.It happens because of pressure systems that cause dry weather. Now, those dry-weather systems are also intensified, making droughts more severe.This amplifies dry conditions, leading to longer, harsher droughts.Johnston emphasised that climate change didnt mean rain or drought everywhere, but it intensified natural wet and dry cycles. Some areas face extreme flooding, others worsening droughts  both driven by the same growing atmospheric energy.Digital solutions and early warningsWhile the challenges are immense, the WMO report notes that digital transformation is helping African countries improve weather forecasts and early warning systems.They note that the South African Weather Service (Saws), which is a member of WMO, has also integrated AI-based forecasting tools and modern radar systems for effective and timely weather predictions.But while these are important steps, the report stresses that much more is needed: more investment in digital infrastructure and capacity building, stronger data stewardship and sharing frameworks and improved equitable access and inclusive service.This is reflected in the fact that many people, including Mkhize, didnt know these floods were happening  despite Saws sending out warnings  due to internet access issues, climate literacy and communication issues.That gap is evident in Sibongile Mkhizes story.

Although the South African Weather Service issued warnings ahead of the 2022 floods, she and many others never received them  a result of limited internet access, poor climate literacy and weak communication channels in informal settlements.Saws confirms it has incorporated AI into the forecasting models process, in post-processing, at the output and data assimilation phase.AI assists in enhancing model capabilities for improved forecasts, data interpolation in areas where theres no observation infrastructure, and enhanced resolution to assist in picking up small-scale features such as convective severe storms.To reach communities who might not have internet, we use radio (community, commercial and public) and work with disaster management authorities at all levels, including provincial, district and local levels, Saws said.\n\nThe municipality eventually relocated her and others to Yellowwood Park Civic Hall, where men, women and children slept on foam mattresses with no privacy.\n\nSome people were drinking, some were fighting.

More than 400 people died. Roads, bridges and entire communities were washed away. The storm was declared a national state of disaster.A crisis beyond one stormThis week, the State of the Climate in Africa 2024 report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) was released, and reflected what Sibongile and thousands of others lived through; extreme weather and climate change are intensifying hunger, insecurity and displacement across Africa, affecting every facet of socioeconomic development.The State of the Climate in Africa report reflects the urgent and escalating realities of climate change across the continent, said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.It also reveals a stark pattern of extreme weather events, with some countries grappling with exceptional flooding caused by excessive rainfall and others enduring persistent droughts and water scarcity.Hottest decade on recordAccording to the WMO, 2024 was either the warmest or second-warmest year recorded in Africa, depending on the dataset. The past decade, as a whole, has been the hottest since records began. The continents average surface temperature last year was 0.86C above the 1991-2020 average, with North Africa warming the fastest  1.28C above the same baseline.This temperature rise is not abstract. It is disrupting farming, labour, health, education and economies.Impacts on agriculture and food securityThe 2024 El Nio-linked drought caused a 16% drop in cereal yields across southern Africa, with Zambia and Zimbabwe hit hardest, losing 43% and 50% of crops respectively. Malawi and Mozambique also saw declines, while South Africa faced significantly below-average harvests, including a maize yield drop of about five million tons. Despite this, overall national agricultural production was generally favourable.While South Africas domestic supply remained sufficient, export shortfalls forced countries such as Zambia and Malawi to import maize, causing temporary price spikes, within global norms.Peter Johnston, a climate scientist at the University of Cape Town who specialises in agriculture and water-related activities, explained to Daily Maverick that South African farmers have shown resilience during recent El Nio events, but the 2024/25 season has been abnormal  late rains, mid-season drought and prolonged wet conditions delayed harvests and complicated drying.He said, We cant just say, oh, its El Nio or La Nia anymore. Nothing seems typical now.Floods and cyclonesIn 2024, southern Africa faced its worst drought in decades, with Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe declaring national disasters due to severe crop failures and water shortages.Meanwhile, East Africa experienced deadly floods from March to May, displacing more than 700,000 people in countries including Kenya, Tanzania and Burundi. West and Central Africa also suffered devastating floods affecting more than four million people.In South Africa, severe storms in June caused flooding, tornadoes and infrastructure damage along the eastern coast, particularly in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, resulting in fatalities and displacement. Since losing her home in 2022, Mkhize has been supporting her community through these recurring floods.How can climate change cause both flooding and drought?The simple answer is that temperatures are rising faster than they have in the geological past, Johnston explained. Because this heating is sudden and ongoing, we now have a more energetic atmosphere. He compared it with kids on a sugar high  normally calm, but suddenly uncontrollable with excess energy.This surge in atmospheric energy triggers several key changes:Increased evaporation and condensation: Higher temperatures cause more water to evaporate from oceans, lakes and soil. This moisture then condenses into clouds, fuelling heavier, more intense rainfall.Stronger winds and sharper pressure gradients: The differences in temperature and pressure become more pronounced, making weather systems more powerful and volatile.More extreme rainfall events: Johnston noted, You may get all that rainfall in one or two days, which can overwhelm drainage systems and cause flooding.At the same time, droughts are becoming more severe.A drought isnt in isolation, Johnston said.It happens because of pressure systems that cause dry weather. Now, those dry-weather systems are also intensified, making droughts more severe.This amplifies dry conditions, leading to longer, harsher droughts.Johnston emphasised that climate change didnt mean rain or drought everywhere, but it intensified natural wet and dry cycles.

West and Central Africa also suffered devastating floods affecting more than four million people.In South Africa, severe storms in June caused flooding, tornadoes and infrastructure damage along the eastern coast, particularly in the Eastern Cape and KwaZulu-Natal, resulting in fatalities and displacement. Since losing her home in 2022, Mkhize has been supporting her community through these recurring floods.How can climate change cause both flooding and drought?The simple answer is that temperatures are rising faster than they have in the geological past, Johnston explained. Because this heating is sudden and ongoing, we now have a more energetic atmosphere. He compared it with kids on a sugar high  normally calm, but suddenly uncontrollable with excess energy.This surge in atmospheric energy triggers several key changes:Increased evaporation and condensation: Higher temperatures cause more water to evaporate from oceans, lakes and soil. This moisture then condenses into clouds, fuelling heavier, more intense rainfall.Stronger winds and sharper pressure gradients: The differences in temperature and pressure become more pronounced, making weather systems more powerful and volatile.More extreme rainfall events: Johnston noted, You may get all that rainfall in one or two days, which can overwhelm drainage systems and cause flooding.At the same time, droughts are becoming more severe.A drought isnt in isolation, Johnston said.It happens because of pressure systems that cause dry weather. Now, those dry-weather systems are also intensified, making droughts more severe.This amplifies dry conditions, leading to longer, harsher droughts.Johnston emphasised that climate change didnt mean rain or drought everywhere, but it intensified natural wet and dry cycles. Some areas face extreme flooding, others worsening droughts  both driven by the same growing atmospheric energy.Digital solutions and early warningsWhile the challenges are immense, the WMO report notes that digital transformation is helping African countries improve weather forecasts and early warning systems.They note that the South African Weather Service (Saws), which is a member of WMO, has also integrated AI-based forecasting tools and modern radar systems for effective and timely weather predictions.But while these are important steps, the report stresses that much more is needed: more investment in digital infrastructure and capacity building, stronger data stewardship and sharing frameworks and improved equitable access and inclusive service.This is reflected in the fact that many people, including Mkhize, didnt know these floods were happening  despite Saws sending out warnings  due to internet access issues, climate literacy and communication issues.That gap is evident in Sibongile Mkhizes story. Although the South African Weather Service issued warnings ahead of the 2022 floods, she and many others never received them  a result of limited internet access, poor climate literacy and weak communication channels in informal settlements.Saws confirms it has incorporated AI into the forecasting models process, in post-processing, at the output and data assimilation phase.AI assists in enhancing model capabilities for improved forecasts, data interpolation in areas where theres no observation infrastructure, and enhanced resolution to assist in picking up small-scale features such as convective severe storms.To reach communities who might not have internet, we use radio (community, commercial and public) and work with disaster management authorities at all levels, including provincial, district and local levels, Saws said.\n\nSibongile was one of more than 40,000 people displaced by the April 2022 floodsthe deadliest in South African history. More than 400 people died. Roads, bridges and entire communities were washed away. The storm was declared a national state of disaster.\n\nA crisis beyond one stormThis week, the State of the Climate in Africa 2024 report by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) was released, and reflected what Sibongile and thousands of others lived through; extreme weather and climate change are intensifying hunger, insecurity and displacement across Africa, affecting every facet of socioeconomic development.The State of the Climate in Africa report reflects the urgent and escalating realities of climate change across the continent, said WMO Secretary-General Celeste Saulo.It also reveals a stark pattern of extreme weather events, with some countries grappling with exceptional flooding caused by excessive rainfall and others enduring persistent droughts and water scarcity.Hottest decade on recordAccording to the WMO, 2024 was either the warmest or second-warmest year recorded in Africa, depending on the dataset. The past decade, as a whole, has been the hottest since records began. The continents average surface temperature last year was 0.86C above the 1991-2020 average, with North Africa warming the fastest  1.28C above the same baseline.This temperature rise is not abstract. It is disrupting farming, labour, health, education and economies.Impacts on agriculture and food securityThe 2024 El Nio-linked drought caused a 16% drop in cereal yields across southern Africa, with Zambia and Zimbabwe hit hardest, losing 43% and 50% of crops respectively. Malawi and Mozambique also saw declines, while South Africa faced significantly below-average harvests, including a maize yield drop of about five million tons.

Since losing her home in 2022, Mkhize has been supporting her community through these recurring floods.How can climate change cause both flooding and drought?The simple answer is that temperatures are rising faster than they have in the geological past, Johnston explained. Because this heating is sudden and ongoing, we now have a more energetic atmosphere. He compared it with kids on a sugar high  normally calm, but suddenly uncontrollable with excess energy.This surge in atmospheric energy triggers several key changes:Increased evaporation and condensation: Higher temperatures cause more water to evaporate from oceans, lakes and soil. This moisture then condenses into clouds, fuelling heavier, more intense rainfall.Stronger winds and sharper pressure gradients: The differences in temperature and pressure become more pronounced, making weather systems more powerful and volatile.More extreme rainfall events: Johnston noted, You may get all that rainfall in one or two days, which can overwhelm drainage systems and cause flooding.At the same time, droughts are becoming more severe.A drought isnt in isolation, Johnston said.It happens because of pressure systems that cause dry weather. Now, those dry-weather systems are also intensified, making droughts more severe.This amplifies dry conditions, leading to longer, harsher droughts.Johnston emphasised that climate change didnt mean rain or drought everywhere, but it intensified natural wet and dry cycles. Some areas face extreme flooding, others worsening droughts  both driven by the same growing atmospheric energy.Digital solutions and early warningsWhile the challenges are immense, the WMO report notes that digital transformation is helping African countries improve weather forecasts and early warning systems.They note that the South African Weather Service (Saws), which is a member of WMO, has also integrated AI-based forecasting tools and modern radar systems for effective and timely weather predictions.But while these are important steps, the report stresses that much more is needed: more investment in digital infrastructure and capacity building, stronger data stewardship and sharing frameworks and improved equitable access and inclusive service.This is reflected in the fact that many people, including Mkhize, didnt know these floods were happening  despite Saws sending out warnings  due to internet access issues, climate literacy and communication issues.That gap is evident in Sibongile Mkhizes story. Although the South African Weather Service issued warnings ahead of the 2022 floods, she and many others never received them  a result of limited internet access, poor climate literacy and weak communication channels in informal settlements.Saws confirms it has incorporated AI into the forecasting models process, in post-processing, at the output and data assimilation phase.AI assists in enhancing model capabilities for improved forecasts, data interpolation in areas where theres no observation infrastructure, and enhanced resolution to assist in picking up small-scale features such as convective severe storms.To reach communities who might not have internet, we use radio (community, commercial and public) and work with disaster management authorities at all levels, including provincial, district and local levels, Saws said.\n\nWhile South Africas domestic supply remained sufficient, export shortfalls forced countries such as Zambia and Malawi to import maize, causing temporary price spikes, within global norms.\n\nPeter Johnston, a climate scientist at the University of Cape Town who specialises in agriculture and water-related activities, explained to Daily Maverick that South African farmers have shown resilience during recent El Nio events, but the 2024/25 season has been abnormal  late rains, mid-season drought and prolonged wet conditions delayed harvests and complicated drying.He said, We cant just say, oh, its El Nio or La Nia anymore.

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nDESPITE Zimbabwes high unemployment rate and grinding poverty among ordinary citizens, President Emmerson Mnangagwas administration claims it is creating jobs while economic development is evident countrywide.\n\nHis son, Deputy Finance Minister Kudakwashe Mnangagwa this week told parliamentarians that the country was on track in terms of employment creation, economic development and other various aspects of its 14 pillars.Even though figures on the ministrys table have shown a positive trajectory, according to the deputy minister, the majority of university and college graduates are jobless, most have become street vendors, whilst in hospitals, nurses and doctors are lamenting lack of equipment and medicines to save the lives of thousands of patients while some fail to access health care and treatment.Reports indicate thousands of school-going age groups, both secondary and primary levels, dropped out last year alone due to financial constraints on their parents part.Deputy Finance Minister David MnangagwaMnangagwa was responding to Mashonaland East Proportional Representation legislator Diana Marikano during a Question-and-Answer session.Marikano had questioned what fiscal policies or reforms were being implemented to stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and reduce poverty in Zimbabwe.Mnangagwa told Deputy Speaker Tsitsi Gezi that the government was following different parameters and matrices to ensure that it reaches an upper-middle-income society by 2030.Looking at our five-year national strategy, which is now going into the second five years, we are on track in terms of employment creation, economic development, and various other aspects of our 14 pillars, Mnangagwa said.Another legislator, Marondera Central MP Caston Matewu queried Mnangagwas response citing ZiGs unacceptability in other economies and in the country as well, a huge trade deficit, and currency instability amongst other concerns.For us to reach an upper middle-class economy, our currency must be acceptable to us, not just to us but to those that we do trade with. Our trade deficit is so huge.We import so much than we export, and our currency, for me to go to any other country, I would need to load a US dollar into a Visa card. What are you doing to ensure that our currency is stable to a point that it is acceptable all over the world; unless we do that, we will not get to an upper-middle-class economy? Matewu said.The deputy minister said Matewu needed to be corrected on his assumptions.Zimbabwe as a country, when it comes to foreign currency earnings, does much better than countries with a GDP that is four times our size. What this means is that when it comes to foreign currency and trade, let us tell our story in the right manner.The Hon. member speaks about stability and speaks to it as if it is an event. In the last few months, the parallel exchange rates and the official rates have been thinning. There has not been a huge increase in the parallel market rates, which is the one that we usually look at to see what the market activity is saying, Mnangagwa explained.Acceptability of the currency is something that when you go into the market, a lot of people complain that there is not enough ZiG within the market. So, you wonder where this lack of acceptability is coming from?Matewu also argued that acceptability meant outside the country but across the world to countries which traded with Zimbabwe.It is not acceptable. I am not talking about here in Zimbabwe. I am talking about countries that we trade with, the MP told Gezi.The deputy finance minister still maintained his stance.I am not sure where the Hon. member wants ZiG to work except for Zimbabwe. Our local currency is meant to be used within Zimbabwean borders.When I mention our export receipts and having enough US dollars, it means that as a country we should be able to use our local currency within Zimbabwe, and when we want to trade outside of Zimbabwe, we exchange for the currency in that country. I am not sure if the Hon. member wants to use ZiG in Russia, the US, and China, but the premiseMnangagwa highlighted that the reason ZiG was said to be local currency is because it is for local transactions.If we have foreign traders who want to do business and transact in Zimbabwe, they can bring in their currency, exchange it for the ZiG, and trade locally.This is the common practice. I am not sure how and where the question arises from the hon. member in this particular context, but I would like to say that ZiG fully works in Zimbabwe and we should not expect it to be used in any other country. It is our local currency.MP for Manicaland Miriam Matinenga asked the deputy minister to enlighten the House in terms of tangible issues that showed the country was moving towards a positive trajectory economically.Mnangagwa told the House that the list was endless and he was supposed to go through all ministries initiatives to show the positive trajectory of the economy.As Treasury and Finance ministry, we come up with an economic development plan and strategy, which then filters through all the different ministries. The point is not to paint a perfect picture.It is to paint a story of a journey, and along this journey, we have different markers and trackers that we look at. These are the ones that inform us that indeed we are on the right track, under our strategy, Mnangagwa stated.However, another opposition legislator Zivai Mhetu, chipped in asking what marker shows the improvement of peoples welfare.Vision 2030 was launched in October 2018. We are now left with five years to get to where we aim to go. For upper-middle income, we are looking at salaries of USD 4,500 monthly. So, right now, where are we? Are there any people earning USD4,500 per month?The deputys response was; We started in 2018, 2019, and 2020. We had TSP, the Transitional Stabilisation Plan, mainly focused on good expenditure. From 2021 to 2025, we are in National Development Strategy 1, which looks at Vision 2030.That has three programmes, TSP and NDS1, which is coming to an end, and National Development Strategy 2, which will start in 2026 to 2030. According to the vision of the President, we are focusing on getting there and we expect to get there and achieve it successfully.\n\nHis son, Deputy Finance Minister Kudakwashe Mnangagwa this week told parliamentarians that the country was on track in terms of employment creation, economic development and other various aspects of its 14 pillars.\n\nEven though figures on the ministrys table have shown a positive trajectory, according to the deputy minister, the majority of university and college graduates are jobless, most have become street vendors, whilst in hospitals, nurses and doctors are lamenting lack of equipment and medicines to save the lives of thousands of patients while some fail to access health care and treatment.Reports indicate thousands of school-going age groups, both secondary and primary levels, dropped out last year alone due to financial constraints on their parents part.Deputy Finance Minister David MnangagwaMnangagwa was responding to Mashonaland East Proportional Representation legislator Diana Marikano during a Question-and-Answer session.Marikano had questioned what fiscal policies or reforms were being implemented to stimulate economic growth, create jobs, and reduce poverty in Zimbabwe.Mnangagwa told Deputy Speaker Tsitsi Gezi that the government was following different parameters and matrices to ensure that it reaches an upper-middle-income society by 2030.Looking at our five-year national strategy, which is now going into the second five years, we are on track in terms of employment creation, economic development, and various other aspects of our 14 pillars, Mnangagwa said.Another legislator, Marondera Central MP Caston Matewu queried Mnangagwas response citing ZiGs unacceptability in other economies and in the country as well, a huge trade deficit, and currency instability amongst other concerns.For us to reach an upper middle-class economy, our currency must be acceptable to us, not just to us but to those that we do trade with.

There has not been a huge increase in the parallel market rates, which is the one that we usually look at to see what the market activity is saying, Mnangagwa explained.Acceptability of the currency is something that when you go into the market, a lot of people complain that there is not enough ZiG within the market. So, you wonder where this lack of acceptability is coming from?Matewu also argued that acceptability meant outside the country but across the world to countries which traded with Zimbabwe.It is not acceptable. I am not talking about here in Zimbabwe. I am talking about countries that we trade with, the MP told Gezi.The deputy finance minister still maintained his stance.I am not sure where the Hon. member wants ZiG to work except for Zimbabwe. Our local currency is meant to be used within Zimbabwean borders.When I mention our export receipts and having enough US dollars, it means that as a country we should be able to use our local currency within Zimbabwe, and when we want to trade outside of Zimbabwe, we exchange for the currency in that country. I am not sure if the Hon. member wants to use ZiG in Russia, the US, and China, but the premiseMnangagwa highlighted that the reason ZiG was said to be local currency is because it is for local transactions.If we have foreign traders who want to do business and transact in Zimbabwe, they can bring in their currency, exchange it for the ZiG, and trade locally.This is the common practice. I am not sure how and where the question arises from the hon. member in this particular context, but I would like to say that ZiG fully works in Zimbabwe and we should not expect it to be used in any other country. It is our local currency.MP for Manicaland Miriam Matinenga asked the deputy minister to enlighten the House in terms of tangible issues that showed the country was moving towards a positive trajectory economically.Mnangagwa told the House that the list was endless and he was supposed to go through all ministries initiatives to show the positive trajectory of the economy.As Treasury and Finance ministry, we come up with an economic development plan and strategy, which then filters through all the different ministries. The point is not to paint a perfect picture.It is to paint a story of a journey, and along this journey, we have different markers and trackers that we look at. These are the ones that inform us that indeed we are on the right track, under our strategy, Mnangagwa stated.However, another opposition legislator Zivai Mhetu, chipped in asking what marker shows the improvement of peoples welfare.Vision 2030 was launched in October 2018. We are now left with five years to get to where we aim to go. For upper-middle income, we are looking at salaries of USD 4,500 monthly. So, right now, where are we? Are there any people earning USD4,500 per month?The deputys response was; We started in 2018, 2019, and 2020. We had TSP, the Transitional Stabilisation Plan, mainly focused on good expenditure. From 2021 to 2025, we are in National Development Strategy 1, which looks at Vision 2030.That has three programmes, TSP and NDS1, which is coming to an end, and National Development Strategy 2, which will start in 2026 to 2030. According to the vision of the President, we are focusing on getting there and we expect to get there and achieve it successfully.\n\nAnother legislator, Marondera Central MP Caston Matewu queried Mnangagwas response citing ZiGs unacceptability in other economies and in the country as well, a huge trade deficit, and currency instability amongst other concerns.\n\nFor us to reach an upper middle-class economy, our currency must be acceptable to us, not just to us but to those that we do trade with. Our trade deficit is so huge.We import so much than we export, and our currency, for me to go to any other country, I would need to load a US dollar into a Visa card. What are you doing to ensure that our currency is stable to a point that it is acceptable all over the world; unless we do that, we will not get to an upper-middle-class economy? Matewu said.The deputy minister said Matewu needed to be corrected on his assumptions.Zimbabwe as a country, when it comes to foreign currency earnings, does much better than countries with a GDP that is four times our size. What this means is that when it comes to foreign currency and trade, let us tell our story in the right manner.The Hon. member speaks about stability and speaks to it as if it is an event.

I am not sure if the Hon. member wants to use ZiG in Russia, the US, and China, but the premiseMnangagwa highlighted that the reason ZiG was said to be local currency is because it is for local transactions.If we have foreign traders who want to do business and transact in Zimbabwe, they can bring in their currency, exchange it for the ZiG, and trade locally.This is the common practice. I am not sure how and where the question arises from the hon. member in this particular context, but I would like to say that ZiG fully works in Zimbabwe and we should not expect it to be used in any other country. It is our local currency.MP for Manicaland Miriam Matinenga asked the deputy minister to enlighten the House in terms of tangible issues that showed the country was moving towards a positive trajectory economically.Mnangagwa told the House that the list was endless and he was supposed to go through all ministries initiatives to show the positive trajectory of the economy.As Treasury and Finance ministry, we come up with an economic development plan and strategy, which then filters through all the different ministries. The point is not to paint a perfect picture.It is to paint a story of a journey, and along this journey, we have different markers and trackers that we look at. These are the ones that inform us that indeed we are on the right track, under our strategy, Mnangagwa stated.However, another opposition legislator Zivai Mhetu, chipped in asking what marker shows the improvement of peoples welfare.Vision 2030 was launched in October 2018. We are now left with five years to get to where we aim to go. For upper-middle income, we are looking at salaries of USD 4,500 monthly. So, right now, where are we? Are there any people earning USD4,500 per month?The deputys response was; We started in 2018, 2019, and 2020. We had TSP, the Transitional Stabilisation Plan, mainly focused on good expenditure. From 2021 to 2025, we are in National Development Strategy 1, which looks at Vision 2030.That has three programmes, TSP and NDS1, which is coming to an end, and National Development Strategy 2, which will start in 2026 to 2030. According to the vision of the President, we are focusing on getting there and we expect to get there and achieve it successfully.\n\nThe deputy finance minister still maintained his stance.\n\nI am not sure where the Hon. member wants ZiG to work except for Zimbabwe.

The outgoing formulations currently have four months of stock remaining, with shipments of the improved triple Fixed Dose Combination expected in July, providing an additional five months of stock.Our antiretroviral therapy (ART) medicine requirements for 2025 are fully funded, Mombeshora said.Despite earlier delays in partner-supported shipments caused by a US Government Stop Work Order, Mombeshora said the ministry managed to mobilise resources to avoid disruptions.While some partner-supported shipments experienced delays earlier this year due to the issuance of a Stop Work Order from the US Government, we responded swiftly and decisively.Through the National AIDS Council (NAC), we mobilised domestic resources to close the gap and ensure an uninterrupted supply of life-saving medications, safeguarding the progress we have made toward achieving the UNAIDS 95-95-95 targets.An estimated 1.2 million Zimbabweans are living with HIV.\n\nThis comes at a time there is hoarding of ARVs triggered by panic over fears that Zimbabwe may be unable to provide HIV medication following the partial cessation of United States funding towards HIV/ AIDS programmes.\n\nSome patients are reportedly bribing nurses to receive six-month allocations of ARVs, with nurses allegedly taking advantage of patients fears.Addressing a press conference Friday, Mombeshora said the country currently holds an eight-month supply of adult ARVs and a four-month supply of paediatric ARVs.The Ministry of Health and Child Care manages medicine supplies using a minimum and maximum inventory control system14 months being the maximum stock level and 8 months the minimum.As previously communicated, ARV medicines are well-stocked, and there is no risk of stockouts across all treatment regimens.Adult first-line ARVs: Eight months of stock available.Paediatric first-line ARVs: The Ministry is phasing out older formulations while introducing a new fixed-dose combination (FDC) medicine.

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nFIRM gold prices on the global markets almost doubled Caledonia Mining Corporations Plc (CMC) profits to US$26,9 million resulting in a 48% gross margin.\n\nSince the beginning of the year,market data shows that gold prices increased by 22,7% to date driven by increased safe-haven demand due to global economic and geopolitical uncertainty, central bank purchases, a weakening dollar, and concerns about inflation. Limited gold supply and its growing utility in various industries are also contributing to the price surge.Local miner,Caledonia says during the first quarter period ,revenue and Profit Revenue was US$56.2 million, a 46% increase from $38.5 million in Q1 2024 driven by higher sales and a 42% increase in the average realised gold price to $2,896 per ounce.Gross profit nearly doubled to $26.9 million (Q1 2024: $13.8 million), resulting in a gross margin of 48% (Q1 2024: 36%). This reflects the benefit of higher gold prices, which more than offset the increase in production costs, the miner said.During the period, Net profit attributable to shareholders increased nearly six times to US$8,9 million (Q1 2024: $1.5 million), while adjusted EPS rose to 58.5 cents from 9.7 cents in Q1 2024. On-mine cost per ounce increased by 12.9% to $1,202 (Q1 2024: $1,065), primarily due to higher labour, power and consumables costs at Blanket Mine.Cash Flow Net cash from operating activities more than doubled to $13.3 million (Q1 2024: $4.9 million), providing strong internal funding for capital investments and debt reduction. The net cash position improved to negative US$4,6 million at quarter-end, compared to negative $14,2 million in Q1 2024.Following the completion of the solar plant sale in April 2025, Caledonias pro forma consolidated net cash position improved to $18.6 million, providing financial flexibility for future growth initiativesCaledonia CEO Mark Learmonth also attributed the strong performance to the miners resilient management style.Caledonia has delivered an exceptional first quarter with gold production up 9.3% and gross profit nearly doubling to US$26,9 million compared to the same period last year. This strong performance demonstrates our operational resilience and ability to capitalise on favorable gold prices, he said.The miners CEO said the successful completion of the solar plant sale for $22.35 million has significantly strengthened our balance sheet, positioning us well to accelerate our growth plans at Bilboes and Motapa whilst investing to achieve operational improvements and efficiencies at Blanket Mine.As we move forward in 2025, we remain focused on three strategic priorities: maximising profitable production at Blanket, optimising the economics of the Bilboes project, and unlocking the exploration potential at Motapa. I am confident that our disciplined approach to capital allocation and strategic growth will continue to deliver strong returns for our shareholders, added Learmonth.\n\nSince the beginning of the year,market data shows that gold prices increased by 22,7% to date driven by increased safe-haven demand due to global economic and geopolitical uncertainty, central bank purchases, a weakening dollar, and concerns about inflation.
