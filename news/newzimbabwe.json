A colleague has since confessed to accidentally shooting her, and has appeared in court.\n\nHoves family engaged the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR), who confirmed they are helping the bereaved family get justice for their slain daughter.\n\nWe are assisting the family of Detective Constable Cassandra Hove, a slain ZRP officer, who died recently while reportedly pursuing armed robbers, which is protesting against the clandestine and unprofessional manner in which the death of the police officer is being handled, the ZLHR posted on social media.\n\nCassandras father, Chikauriso Hove, has engaged the services of lawyers from ZLHR, who on Wednesday wrote a letter of complaint to the Officer-In-Charge at ZRP Bulawayo Central Police and gave the law enforcement agency a seven-day ultimatum to furnish him with tangible details of circumstances, which caused and led to the death of his daughter.\n\nThe letter was also served tothe Officer-In-Charge at Pumula Police Station, the Officer Commanding Bulawayo Province, ZRP Commissioner-General Stephen Mutamba and Home Affairs Minister Kazembe Kazembe.\n\nIn the letter, Hove protested the unprofessional manner in which ZRP handled the death of his daughter.\n\nHove said he is aggrieved and pained by the conduct of ZRP, her deceased daughters employer, that she served diligently and dearly with her life, which had a duty to protect her, but was not forthcoming with sharing information to the family surrounding the circumstances which led to Cassandras death, which should help the grieving family to find closure, the lawyers said.\n\nThe family, Hove said, is disturbed by the fact that family members seem to be getting second-hand information and late updates on Cassandras matter through unofficial channels and just recently, it came to their attention that a certain police officer had confessed to killing their daughter.\n\nHove said Cassandras family is greatly concerned about the allegations that she may have met her fate at the hands of one of her colleagues.\n\nIn addition, Hove said Cassandras family is alarmed at the allegations raised about the conduct of one Lethokuhle Sibanda, who later on was known to be a colleague of the deceased law enforcement agent operating in the same unit with the late police officer, and who had reportedly completed some forms authorising the carrying out of a post-mortem on the body of the deceased person without consulting his family.\n\nHove also stated that his family had been advised that sometime after Cassandra had been shot, the same Sibanda had visited the deceased persons residence, where she found the late law enforcement agents children and demanded certain information pertaining to her residential properties and demanded her mobile phones, but her children refused to comply after getting guidance from their relatives.\n\nCassandras father also complained that Sibanda had received R3,000 from the residents of Luveve suburb in Bulawayo as contribution to the deceased law enforcement agents funeral, but the money was never remitted to the family, conduct which the family is concerned about.\n\nHove added that his family had also received information that a suspect, named Fikile Ncube, had been arrested by ZRP officers on the night when Cassandra died in connection with her death, but this information was not officially communicated to the family or his relatives.\n\nOn 8 March 2025, Hove said he attended a meeting together with his relatives with the Officer-In-Charge of CID Homicide in Bulawayo and other ZRP officials, where he was informed that the preliminary findings were that his daughter had been shot by a police issued firearm contrary to what the family had been told before and efforts to get full information as to what could have happened to his daughter were futile as the ZRP officials were not forthcoming.\n\nHove said Cassandras family had, after much deliberation, reluctantly agreed to take her body for burial in Mberengwa, with the hope that ZRP would keep updating them on the progress of investigations surrounding her death.\n\nAfter Cassandras burial, Hove said, the family reported a case of murder at ZRP Pumula Police Station on March 13, 2025, and police went mum.\n\n",

It is that finding which appellant wanted it to make and to pronounce itself on its effect. By our law, an accused person cannot be expected to go through a trial where no valid charge exists. That is an irregularity, he argued.\n\nMpofus argued that the acquittal of Chaganda by the magistrate had nothing to do with his client and whether the decision was correct or not could not be attributed to him.\n\nHe also argued that the decision by the magistrate is still standing, which made it valid and had they had an issue, it would have been overturned.\n\nIn the instant case, what is revealed is that appellant (Rubaya) represented an accused person who was acquitted, and that the court acquitting the appellants client also ordered the release of the gold.\n\nWhether or not it was competent for the Learned Magistrate to make such an order is irrelevant, as the conduct of the Magistrate is not imputable to the appellant and no basis has been alleged for taking that position, Mpofu argued.\n\nA three-panel bench comprising Justices George Chiweshe, Chinembiri Bhunu and Hlekani Mwayera found favour with Rubayas arguments and cleared him of wrongdoing. The judges also acquitted magistrate Makunde.\n\n",

We did not go to war so that you could monopolise corrupt contracts. We are going to deal with you decisivelymark my wordsand thoroughly. By the time Mnangagwa leaves power, Zimbabwe will be a shell, and this is totally unacceptable. We cannot accept that, said Geza.\n\nTagwirei, through his proxies, has been securing government contracts. He won a multimillion-dollar deal to construct the Mbudzi Interchange flyover. He has also expanded his business interests into mining and has a near-monopoly in the fuel sector.\n\nAdditionally, Tagwirei has been spearheading the Command Agriculture programme and is currently the chairperson of the Land Tenure Implementation Committee.\n\nThe business moguls company, Sakunda Holdings, was implicated in the disappearance of $3 billion from the Ministry of Agriculture between 2017 and 2018.\n\nAs a result, Tagwirei was sanctioned by the United States of America, which accused him of assisting senior government officials in corruption.\n\nGeza stated that corruption has become rampant under Mnangagwas administration due to cronyism.\n\nCorruption in Mnangagwas government has become a cancer in this country. Mnangagwa has continued to deploy his cronies to milk this country dry.\n\nWe fought for economic emancipation and the equitable distribution of resources. But, on the contrary, Mnangagwa is stopping at nothing to take everything away from the country, said Geza.\n\n",
