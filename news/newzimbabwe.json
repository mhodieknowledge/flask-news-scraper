            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nPRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa has claimed a shared history with the late former Zambian President Edgar Lungu, asserting they were contemporaries at law school.\n\nSpeaking at the Zambian Embassy on Thursday, where he signed the Book of Condolences following Lungus passing, Mnangagwa insisted on a connection stretching back to his student days.\n\nWe were students together at law school. There is a lot of history between me and him and several other Zambians, I did my education in Zambia, of course he was junior, Mnangagwa stated.\n\nHowever, this assertion has been met with scepticism, with critics quick to point to what they perceive as a series of legal missteps made by the President since assuming office in November 2017.\n\nThese alleged blunders have fuelled doubts about the extent of Mnangagwas legal knowledge and background.\n\nExamples cited include early constitutional gaffes, such as ministerial appointments made outside the bounds of Parliament. The public was obliged to remind him of his overreach, forcing him to rescind his decisions.\n\nFurther scrutiny arose when, during the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, in 2018, Mnangagwa appeared to announce the 2018 elections for May, a date predating the constitutional earliest possible polling day of July 23, 2018.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, shortly after taking office, Mnangagwa issued an ultimatum to those accused of externalising US dollars and assets, demanding they return the loot or face prosecution. This was despite the absence of any Zimbabwean law criminalising such activity at the time, a move widely interpreted as a significant oversight.\n\nThese early missteps have left many questioning the Presidents legal prowess.\n\nDespite the Presidents assertion, critics remain unconvinced. They point to a lack of tangible evidence, noting the absence of photographs or verifiable accounts from alleged classmates to support the claim of a shared legal education.\n\nThe claim, they argue, rests solely on Mnangagwas oral tradition.\n\nDespite the controversy, Mnangagwa further described Lungu as a leader of foresight in terms of development and said his passing represented a significant loss not only for Zambia but for the region as a whole.\n\nWe have lost one of our illustrious leaders he was committed not only to Zambia but to the rest of the region he was one of us he was a man who had foresight in terms of development and collaboration between several countries, he said.\n\nLungu lost the Zambian elections to Hakainde Hichilema in August 2021.\n\nHe has since reportedly enjoyed a close relationship with Zanu PF, with some suggesting Mnangagwas party was funding a potential comeback bid in Zambias 2026 elections, a claim both parties vehemently denied.\n\n",

These laws lack adequate judicial oversight, raising serious concerns about privacy, civil liberties, and freedom of expression.\n\nParticularly, the Cyber and Data Protection Act provides law enforcement agencies unrestricted access to personal data and digital communications.\n\nThe absence of independent oversight facilitates mass surveillance of HRDs, journalists, and political opponents, undermining privacy rights and exposing activists to increased risks of persecution, read the report.The Cyber and Data Protection Act has been criticised for fostering self-censorship among journalists, who fear persecution by authorities.Earlier this year, Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) senior journalist Blessed Mhlanga was arrested under the Act, a move that drew widespread condemnation. He endured more than 70 days in pre-trial detention.Surveillance and spyware use in Zimbabwe reveal a pattern of political repression, particularly during elections and constitutional debates.In early 2025, Zimbabwes government intensified its crackdown on dissent, exemplified by the seventy-nine day detention of journalist Blessed Mhlanga, alongside repeated arrests of critics like Hopewell Chinono and Jacob Ngarivhume, likely facilitated by spyware surveillance (Committee to Protect Journalists, 2025), the report notes.The report further highlights that surveillance has intensified amid internal divisions within the ruling Zanu PF party, as factions clash over proposals to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas rule beyond constitutional limits.Amid 20242025 debates on constitutional amendments to extend presidential term limits, CCTV expansion in Harare has coincided with heightened activist monitoring.The 2021 Cyber and Data Protection Law provides no oversight, enabling surveillance abuses in a polarised political climate, with data likely fuelling targeted spyware operations, the research further noted.\n\nThe absence of independent oversight facilitates mass surveillance of HRDs, journalists, and political opponents, undermining privacy rights and exposing activists to increased risks of persecution, read the report.\n\nThe Cyber and Data Protection Act has been criticised for fostering self-censorship among journalists, who fear persecution by authorities.\n\nEarlier this year, Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) senior journalist Blessed Mhlanga was arrested under the Act, a move that drew widespread condemnation.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nIF the controversy surrounding the Geo Pomona waste management contract was not already festering, it has now been rubbed raw by revelations that the company is enjoying a tax holiday, meaning it will not be remitting a single cent to Treasury.\n\nThis is despite the millions of United States dollars Geo Pomona is due to get from the City of Harare (CoH) under the contentious agreement.\n\nAccording to the contract, which NewZimbabwe.Com has seen, Geo Pomona stands to rake in over US$30 million annually from the CoH, yet will contribute nothing in tax revenue.\n\nThe schedule of payments and tax and duties section of the contract explicitly states that Geo Pomona has been granted duty-free and tax-free status for the entire duration of the agreement.\n\nTreasury has so far remained tight-lipped on the justification for this extraordinary concession.\n\nContracting party shall ensure that the contractor is granted duty exemption and income tax exemption for the period of the contract, the document states.\n\nThe contracting party shall pay US$2,701,404.00 (Two million Seven Hundred and one thousand four hundred and four United States Dollars only) excluding value-added tax every month with effect from signature of the contract. The amount is based on the refuse collection and street cleaning service rendered by the contractor, it continues.\n\nFurther adding to the sense of unease is the apparent erosion of the CoHs control over waste management, a function ostensibly outsourced but not supervised.\n\nFormer Mt Pleasant MP Fadzayi Mahere has also weighed in, questioning the logic behind the tax exemption.\n\nWhy does the agreement stipulate that Geo Pomona will pay 0% tax yet it is being paid so handsomely through public funds? What is the legal basis of this irrational tax exemption?, she wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday.\n\nWhile Geo Pomona is ostensibly led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Delish Nguwaya, persistent reports suggest he is merely a figurehead. Whispers persist that the real power brokers are members of the First Family, specifically Sean Mnangagwa, son of President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nThe Geo Pomona deal appears to have usurped the CoHs legal responsibility for refuse collection and street cleaning in the capital.\n\nHarare Mayor Jacob Mafume was unavailable for comment, citing his absence from the country. CoH spokesman Stanley Gama also directed inquiries to Mafume.\n\nIntriguingly, President Mnangagwa recently showered praise on Mafume, describing him as a cooperative and helpful mayor. This endorsement is somewhat unusual, given that Mafume is a member of the opposition. Critics suggest the praise is part of the complex political landscape surrounding the Geo Pomona deal.\n\n",

Its Executive Chairman and CEO, Delish Nguwaya, is a regular attendee at state functions and is known to be a close associate of President Emmerson Mnangagwas son, Sean Mnangagwa.\n\nNguwaya was previously charged with corruption over Covid-19 procurement contracts involving his company, Drax International, in 2020, but was acquitted by court in September 2023.\n\nThey have no legal mandate to independently take over public waste management under our law, Mahere posted on her X account on Wednesday.\n\nMahere, a constitutional lawyer, argued that Geo Pomona should not impose itself on residents, as their obligations lie with the CoH, not individual households.\n\nFormer Mt Pleasant MP Fadzayi Mahere\n\nThey are not a statutory body. At best, if they have a contract with City of Harare, they are the citys agent. This means that the City of Harare is the principal and public facing party with Geo Pomona working under them as an agent. They cannot do their business independently of the city and force themselves onto people with whom they have no legal relationship.\n\nMahere questioned Geo Pomonas authority to bill residents directly, stating that the company lacks the legal basis to do so.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, they have no right to bill or otherwise engage residents directly absent a valid agreement with individual residents to do so. Only the City of Harare can do that in line with its powers as a local authority under Zimbabwes local government laws, she said.\n\nGeo Pomona is set to receive over US$162 million from the CoH over five years, with ratepayers ultimately footing the bill.\n\nThe 30-year agreement stipulated that Harare must deliver 550 tonnes of waste, or a minimum of 200,750 tonnes per year, resulting in US$8.03 million for the company in the first year.\n\nThis has opened doors for Geo Pomona to potentially take control of the entire waste management process, from street sweeping and refuse collection to waste disposal thereby billing residents directly.\n\n",
