The hostels are characterised by raw sewage and a lack of water, amid a ballooning number of residents.\n\nCHRA said the situation is likely to worsen, with HCC failing to take responsibility for renovating the flats.\n\nThe court had ruled that the city must take immediate action to restore dignity and protect public health by upgrading the dilapidated and unsanitary Mbare hostels, which have long suffered from broken sewer systems, water shortages, and unsafe living conditions.\n\nNow, instead of complying with the judgment, the City of Harare is fighting to reverse the ruling, raising alarm bells among housing rights advocates and public health experts. This move threatens to deepen the housing and hygiene crisis already faced by thousands of Mbare residents, many of whom live in overcrowded, hazardous environments, said CHRA.\n\n",

As per leading retailers, a key impediment to viability has been S.I 81A of 2024, an exchange control act that mandated the selling of goods and services at the official exchange rate, noted the report.\n\nIt further though stated that Zimbabwesoperating environment for companiesremained challenging overall, citing key issues such as elevated production costs as well as sporadic operating liquidity squeezes in light of the tightening of monetary conditions.\n\nIt mentioned emerging cost pressures including the governments recent increase of 19.1% to the diesel levy as further worsening costs for companies.\n\nHeadwinds in Zimbabwe had already affected Hippo Valley, which has had to rightsize its workforce with 1 000 workers expected to be let go by August.\n\nOK Zimbabwe, another prominent retailer battling headwinds, is now undertaking a $30m rights issue to stabilize the company. The retailer has also announced further closures of stores, pointing to a 2025 year that remains volatile and fragile, but with a possibility of better performances by consumer companies.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nAfter a powerful debut at the 2025 National Arts Festival, Calvin RatladisBreakfast with Mugabeis set to make its way to the Market Theatre  bringing with it a bold, unflinching meditation on power, memory, and the ghosts that haunt leadership.\n\nThe production, which drew strong responses during its Makhanda run from July 3 to 6 as part of the festival  South Africas longest-running and most prestigious celebration of the arts  marked a significant moment for Ratladi, this years Standard Bank Young Artist for Theatre.\n\nBased on the award-winning script by British playwright Fraser Grace, the production reimagines President Robert Mugabe not as the distant figure weve come to know through headlines and political discourse, but as a haunted man, navigating memory, grief, and the ghosts of power.\n\nIn Graces fictionalised account, loosely inspired by reports that Mugabe once sought psychiatric help for his declining mental health, we find Zimbabwes former president in conversation with a white psychiatrist.\n\nWhat begins as a clinical session soon unravels into a layered exploration of trauma, nationalism, identity, and the burdens of leadership.Breakfast with Mugabehas been hailed as a modern-day Macbeth, but in Ratladis hands, the play becomes something even more personal and political.\n\nNever in my deepest existence did I imagine I would direct this play, Ratladi admits.\n\nI read it in 2016 while I was still an undergrad. I loved the script, but it was not the kind of work I gravitate towards.\n\nYet something lingered. Over the years, he noticed how the themes of land dispossession, power, African culture, spirituality and ancestry echoed his own artistic concerns. The connection deepened, not just with Mugabe the leader, but with Mugabe the man.\n\nI was interested in who this man really was. Not the version fed to us by the media and propaganda. I wanted to know the colour of his underwear, the small decisions in his household that somehow held global consequences. These things arent just personal, theyre ancestral, psychological, spiritual.\n\nTo ground the production in authenticity, Ratladi brought on a cultural dramaturg from Zimbabwe, Professor Samuel Ravengai, an academic intimately familiar with the countrys spiritual and political terrain.\n\nThe dramaturg helped guide certain choices in the staging, allowing Ratladi to merge intuitive direction with lived cultural insight. Every moment in the show was decided, he says. Sometimes I followed their advice fully, sometimes partially. But I always listened.\n\nHis cast, too, reflects this commitment to truth. Themba Ndaba brings gravitas to the role of Robert Mugabe, while Gontse Ntshegang embodies Grace Mugabe with a commanding, complex presence. Craig Jackson rounds out the principal cast as Andrew Peric, the probing psychiatrist whose sessions with Mugabe drive the psychological tension of the piece.\n\nOne surprise addition was the actor cast as the presidents bodyguard, Farai Chigudu, who flew in from Zimbabwe to audition.\n\nI asked him three times to come in, and he never once mentioned he was flying from Zimbabwe, Ratladi recalls. Now hes here, in South Africa, making his theatre debut.\n\nThe production process was as intense as the script itself. With just four weeks to mount the piece, Ratladi and his team worked at an unrelenting pace, driven by what he describes as a divine plan.\n\nThis felt like Gods work. Everything aligned, cast, collaborators, and timing. Things I dreamed about years ago just started falling into place.\n\nBut why should people come see Breakfast with Mugabe? For Ratladi, the answer lies in what the play dares to confront.\n\nIn African leadership, vulnerability is still a taboo, he says. And I think this play opens up that conversation. It shows how the political and the personal are deeply intertwined, how a moment of discomfort in a leaders household can spill over and shape the fate of an entire nation.\n\nRatladi refers to the piece as being full of flaws, fear, brilliance, and brokenness. At its heart, its about human beings, not headlines. I had to guide the actors to play real people. That meant stripping away performance masks and finding emotional truth. I hope audiences leave unsettled, in the best way, questioning the cost of silence, the weight of history, and what it means to protect the myths of ones life.\n\nRatladi insists that Breakfast with Mugabe is far more than a biographical study; its a meditation on the aftershocks of colonialism, the psychological toll of liberation, and the fragile humanity obscured by political power. His interpretation is steeped in African cosmology and cultural specificity, yet it echoes with a universality that resonates far beyond the continent.\n\nEvery day I walked into rehearsal, it felt like coming home, he says. Not work. Home. And we understood the politics of this continent, but also where we are now, and how this story might speak to the global moment.\n\nHe adds that the production has changed him. One thing this work has taught me is to trust slowness. To listen. Ive learned that the most powerful moments are found in the quiet corners of a scene, in the breath before the line. Its reaffirmed my commitment to telling African stories with complexity, without simplifying our realities to fit Western expectations.\n\nBreakfast with Mugabe will make its highly anticipated debut at The Market Theatre, where it will run from July 16 to August 10.\n\n",
