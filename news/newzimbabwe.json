The M23 does not compel anyone to return without firm security guarantees, he said.\n\nThe M23, which is made up of ethnic Tutsis, say they are fighting for minority rights, while DR Congos government says the rebels are seeking control of the eastern regions vast mineral wealth.\n\nDR Congo and the UN accused Rwandas Tutsi-dominated government of backing the M23  an allegation which Kigali has persistently denied.\n\nBut recently, the official response has shifted, with government spokespeople stating that fighting near its border is a security threat.\n\n",

We do not, in any way, want to see a Zimbabwe where the rights of the people are being eroded. In 2028, we expect to go to the polls.\n\nWe expect to have the opportunity to register our candidates and to elect a new president for Zimbabwe. That is our constitutional right, and we are urging those in ZANU PF to keep their factional disputes to themselves. Do not involve the nation, and do not disrespect our constitutional document. It is the right of citizens to choose their leaders, said Valerio.\n\nDespite Mnangagwa refusing to endorse the extension of his rule, his supporters have been rallying to push for the constitutional amendment.\n\nHe, however, has not publicly condemned the actions of this faction within ZANU PF.\n\nValerio warned that the country should not repeat the mistake of being drawn into ZANU PFs internal politics.\n\nIt is quite unfortunate that Zimbabwe keeps going down the same path. In 2017, we were presented with an opportunity for a new future. Now, we are hearing this new mantra saying we must keep the president in power because he is doing such a great job. This is why we are launching the Community Wall Initiative. We are covering the entire country because we want to put it on record: no one wants 2030.\n\nIf you speak to the people, there are hundreds gathered here today, and they will tell you clearly that they want something different every time they go to the polls. We are no longer interested in this. As UZA, we will ensure that the voice of the citizens is on record. We will not get involved in this factional fight, she said.\n\n",

Data also indicates that the informal sector has cost Zimbabwe at least US$1,15 billion in potential fiscal revenue between 2020 and 2023.\n\nUnder this framework, vendors will be licensed by local authorities in consultation with the Central Government.\n\nSpeaking at the post-cabinet briefing Tuesday, Information Minister Jenfan Muswere said, Under short-term measures, the use of electronic money will now be compulsory for all businesses and shall be achieved through the introduction of a compulsory tax payment system to ensure that every eligible taxpayer pays tax and the establishment of a Domestic Inter-agency Team to ensure informal sector compliance with tax laws.\n\nThe government seeks to bring all businesses into the tax bracket and enhance the effectiveness of the foreign exchange market.\n\nIn the long-term, the government will address the business environment to streamline fees, and charges and minimize duplication of work by Government Agencies as well as improve electricity supply in a bid to enable MSMEs to graduate into formal businesses.\n\nThe Cabinet also agreed to expedite the construction of power plants and upgrading of the distribution network to enhance the availability of electricity, incentivise the use of alternative energy sources, and expedite social protection coverage to the informal sector.\n\n",

We commend the governments allocation of funds in the National Budget as of 2024 to make the compensation a reality.\n\nSeveral affected investors have received initial payouts, and an emerging sense of closure exists.It marks a significant milestone and we consider it a very encouraging step towards a comprehensive and fair settlement for farmers and investors in Zimbabwe, the ambassadors said in a statement.\n\nThe President of the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the champion of the Zimbabwe Arrears clearance and Debt resolution, Dr Akinwumi Adesina hailed the milestone achievement and implored more development partners to support the initiative.\n\nThe compensation demonstrates the governments goodwill and commitment to building trust in the process and improving in the country. The progress Zimbabwe has made, the commitment and resilience it is showing, calls for support from development partners to facilitate the countrys efforts in implementing ongoing reforms and to provide the much-needed cushion to particularly the vulnerable members of the population, he said.\n\nIn 2022, the Government of Zimbabwe established a Structured Dialogue Platform with all its creditors and development partners to institutionalize engagement on economic and governance reforms to underpin the Arrears clearance and Debt Resolution Process.\n\n",
