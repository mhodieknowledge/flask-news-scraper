Before the rebasing of the economy, taxes were 30% of GDP (double Africas average ) making Zim the most taxed African country, Biti said.\n\nThe former finance minister said the government has no clear guiding ideas and is using taxes to cover up its reckless spending which falls on ordinary working people, leaving them with little or nothing to live on.\n\nAt any given time the average Zim pays annually at least 15 different types of taxes and levies that include PAYEE, corporate taxes, IMMT, VAT, Fuel levies, carbon taxes, AIDS levies , excise duties on alcohol and cigarettes presumptive taxes,stamp duties toll gates, vehicle licenses, ZBC, stamp duties, customs duties, capital gains taxes, rates,NSSA to name a few.\n\nAn ideological vacuous regime sees taxes as an antidote to an overzealous expansionary fiscal policy.\n\nHigh regressive taxes hit innocent working people who are left with little or no disposable income.\n\nLow disposable incomes underpin a crises of under accumulation, the basis of any economic recession. Thanks to high toxic taxes, an artificially tight monetary policy and a mismanaged exchange rate this economy is bleeding, he added.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA Magunje family was left shattered after their 20-year-old son murdered his own sister in cold blood, then lost his sight on the eve of his trial.\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Philda Muzofa, sitting with assessors in Chinhoyi, convicted Isaac Mashonga, now 28, of brutally killing his sister, Dadirai Mashonga, in their kitchen hut in Mashonga Village, Zvipani, Magunje, in July 2017.\n\nThe horror began when their 93-year-old father, Champion Mashonga, and his wife woke up to find their daughters headless body sprawled in blood.\n\nNo parent can imagine one of his or her children beheading his sibling in their kitchen, Muzofa said while delivering her judgment, calling it a tragedy that will haunt this family and community forever.\n\nOn the night of July 13, 2017, Isaac, then 20, arrived at his parents home in the company of a local businessman known as Giant, real name Robert Tichareva.\n\nThe businessman was arrested together with Mashonga, but has since passed on.\n\nProsecutors told the court the two had conspired to kill Dadirai for ritual purposes, with Isaac allegedly promised US$4,000 for the beheading.\n\nThat night, Dadirai was fast asleep in the kitchen hut.\n\nVillagers later testified that Isaac led Robert straight to her room.\n\nInside, she was strangled and then decapitated using a kitchen knife, axe and adze.\n\nThe pair stuffed the head into a green satchel and smuggled it out to a derelict building near the business centre.\n\nThe following morning, Isaac returned to the homestead wearing blood-soaked clothes.\n\nVillagers who gathered at the gruesome scene apprehended him, tied his hands, and later forced him to lead them to the hidden satchel. Inside was Dadirais head.\n\nHe confessed and showed us the weapons, testified his father, Champion. As a father, I had no reason to misrepresent the facts. I was simply a troubled father.\n\nAs if the ordeal was not enough, Isaac lost his sight while awaiting trial.\n\nPrison doctors confirmed he is now 80% blind, a development that deepened his elderly parents pain.\n\nFor this elderly couple, they have lost two children at the same time  one through death and one through incarceration, the judge noted.\n\nInside prison, Isaacs blindness has left him dependent on fellow inmates for food, bathing and movement. Being blind and in prison presents a double challenge, the court acknowledged, though ruling that disability could not shield him from punishment.\n\nIsaac had claimed he was drugged by Robert and acted under the businessmans instructions. But Justice Muzofa dismissed his story as far-fetched and chicanery.\n\nThe accused literally took the Court for granted, the judge said. He carried the satchel fully aware that it had his sisters head. He then went to sleep. How can a person conduct himself likewise and yet claim he was intoxicated?\n\nThe court found that Isaac acted as a willing accomplice. The proved facts admit of no other inference except that the accused was part of this grand plan, Justice Muzofa ruled.\n\nThe judge said the killing had induced a sense of shock and revulsion in the community and branded it murder in aggravating circumstances.\n\nAlthough Isaacs youth, six years in pre-trial custody and his disability were considered, the court said retribution and deterrence must prevail.\n\nHe now faces decades behind bars,blind, broken, and carrying the weight of a family curse: the brother who killed his sister and destroyed his parents twilight years.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nZimbabwe is stepping up efforts to expand beef exports to Asian markets, with authorities intensifying surveillance of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) to safeguard herd health and meet international standards.\n\nOnce a major beef exporter in the late 1980s, Zimbabwes livestock sector suffered a sharp decline at the turn of the millennium due to the Fast-Track Land Reform Programme, which disrupted large-scale commercial ranching. This, combined with repeated disease outbreaks such as FMD, led to shrinking herd sizes and the loss of lucrative export markets.\n\nIn recent years, however, the sector has shown significant potential to recover through private and government-led initiatives aimed at boosting productivity, improving quality, and opening new markets.\n\nDeputy Lands and Agriculture Minister Vangelis Haritatos told Parliament that Zimbabwe is now working on expanding its beef export base to East Asia.\n\nGovernment is currently negotiating a bilateral Beef Export Trade Protocol with Asian countries such as the United Arab Emirates and Indonesia. The main challenge affecting exports has been foot-and-mouth disease control.\n\nTo this end, Government has intensified FMD surveillance and established disease-free zones for beef production, Haritatos said.\n\nHe added that the ministry has partnered with African Livestock and Organic Welfare (ALOW) and ZimTrade to ensure beef destined for export meets international quality standards.\n\nEast Asia represents a vast market for beef imports, driven by rising demand from its growing middle class. China remains one of the worlds largest consumers, while Japan and South Korea are also among the regions top importers.\n\n",
