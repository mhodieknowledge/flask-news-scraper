Bumper-to-bumper traffic had delayed her car journey to Ahmedabad airport  so much so that she missed her Air India flight to London Gatwick by just 10 minutes.\n\nMs Chauhan, a business administration student who lives in Bristol with her husband, had been visiting western India for a holiday.The 28-year-old was due to fly home on AI171 on Thursday, which crashed shortly after take-off, killing 241 people on board and more on the ground.But after arriving at the airport less than an hour before departure, airline staff turned her away.We got very angry with our driver and left the airport in frustration, she recalls. I was very disappointed.We left the airport and stood at a place to drink tea and after a while, before leaving we were talking to the travel agent about how to get a refund for the ticket.There, I got a call that the plane had gone down.Speaking to the BBCs Gujarati service, she adds: This is totally a miracle for me.Ms Chauhan says she arrived at the airport at 12:20 PM local time, 10 minutes after boarding was due to commence.Her digital boarding pass, seen by BBC News, shows her assigned to economy class seat 36G.But despite having checked in online, she says airline staff would not allow her to complete the process at the airport.She had travelled from Ankleshwar  201km (125 miles) south of Ahmedabad  before being held up in Ahmedabads city centre traffic.Ms Chauhan says: When I missed the flight, I was dejected. Only thing that I had in mind was, If I had started a little early, I would have boarded the plane.I requested airline staff to allow me inside as I am only 10 minutes [late]. I told them that I am the last passenger and so please allow me to board the plane, but they did not allow me.The Gatwick flight took off as scheduled on Thursday afternoon, but appeared to struggle to gain altitude and crashed about 30 seconds into the flight.The plane hit a residential area, killing 241 passengers and 12 crew members. At least eight people on the ground are so far known to have died.One passenger, British national Vishwashkumar Ramesh, survived the crash and was treated in hospital for injuries.\n\nMs Chauhan, a business administration student who lives in Bristol with her husband, had been visiting western India for a holiday.\n\nThe 28-year-old was due to fly home on AI171 on Thursday, which crashed shortly after take-off, killing 241 people on board and more on the ground.But after arriving at the airport less than an hour before departure, airline staff turned her away.We got very angry with our driver and left the airport in frustration, she recalls.

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nZIMBABWE continues to witness an increase in digital surveillance by authorities, which has become an impediment to civil liberties resulting in the repression of journalists and human rights defenders.\n\nThis is according to the latest research report by Unwanted Witness, titled Surveillance/Spyware: An Impediment to Civil Society, HRDs and Journalists in East & Southern Africa, launched in Harare, Friday.\n\nJournalists and human rights defenders are bearing the brunt of digital surveillance, which the government has expanded through laws such as the Cyber and Data Protection Act.\n\nThe report indicates that this legislation grants the government broad powers to conduct surveillance under the guise of national security, undermining human rights.\n\nZimbabwes surveillance law grants the State sweeping surveillance powers, enabling mass monitoring of individuals under the guise of national security. These laws lack adequate judicial oversight, raising serious concerns about privacy, civil liberties, and freedom of expression.\n\nParticularly, the Cyber and Data Protection Act provides law enforcement agencies unrestricted access to personal data and digital communications.\n\nThe absence of independent oversight facilitates mass surveillance of HRDs, journalists, and political opponents, undermining privacy rights and exposing activists to increased risks of persecution, read the report.The Cyber and Data Protection Act has been criticised for fostering self-censorship among journalists, who fear persecution by authorities.Earlier this year, Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) senior journalist Blessed Mhlanga was arrested under the Act, a move that drew widespread condemnation. He endured more than 70 days in pre-trial detention.Surveillance and spyware use in Zimbabwe reveal a pattern of political repression, particularly during elections and constitutional debates.In early 2025, Zimbabwes government intensified its crackdown on dissent, exemplified by the seventy-nine day detention of journalist Blessed Mhlanga, alongside repeated arrests of critics like Hopewell Chinono and Jacob Ngarivhume, likely facilitated by spyware surveillance (Committee to Protect Journalists, 2025), the report notes.The report further highlights that surveillance has intensified amid internal divisions within the ruling Zanu PF party, as factions clash over proposals to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas rule beyond constitutional limits.Amid 20242025 debates on constitutional amendments to extend presidential term limits, CCTV expansion in Harare has coincided with heightened activist monitoring.The 2021 Cyber and Data Protection Law provides no oversight, enabling surveillance abuses in a polarised political climate, with data likely fuelling targeted spyware operations, the research further noted.\n\nThe absence of independent oversight facilitates mass surveillance of HRDs, journalists, and political opponents, undermining privacy rights and exposing activists to increased risks of persecution, read the report.\n\nThe Cyber and Data Protection Act has been criticised for fostering self-censorship among journalists, who fear persecution by authorities.\n\nEarlier this year, Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) senior journalist Blessed Mhlanga was arrested under the Act, a move that drew widespread condemnation.
