The road to be used during the exercise is Solomon Mujuru, formerly known as Kirkman Road, Dube said.\n\nThe army spokesperson reiterated that the exercise will be conducted during the day and the public is, therefore, urged to remain calm.\n\nThe public is therefore requested not to panic as the training exercise is part of routine training by ZNA units, added Col Dube.\n\nThe preemptive move was ostensibly timed conveniently to counter the misconception that the drill was a signal for masses to take to the streets in protest against President Emmerson Mnangagwas government, as hoped for by war veteran Blessed Bombshell Runesu Geza.\n\nGeza has on numerous broadcasts vaguely stated that a signal shall come at the appropriate time and Zimbabweans must march in the streets demanding Mnangagwas exit on accusations of a slew of charges, including grand corruption.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nHIGH Court judge Justice Christopher Dube-Banda has dismissed an application against a Murewa widow who was being sued US$60,000 for malicious prosecution by her stepson.\n\nThe complainant in the case, Collin Benyure, was suing his stepmother, Anna Benyure, claiming US$$20,000 for emotional stress, US$$30,000 for damages to his reputation, and US$10,000 for legal costs incurred during the prosecution.\n\nThe widowdid not file a notice to defend, resulting in the matter being set down on the unopposed roll.\n\nThe judge dismissed the claim, ruling that Collin had no evidence to support his claim.\n\nThe declaration stated that on 8 May 2024, Anna falsely claimed that the plaintiff, Collin, destroyed her seven-roomed house at Benyure homestead, Nyamakosi Village, Mutoko.\n\nThe court heard Collin was subsequently charged with the crime of contravening s 140 of the Criminal Law [Codification and Reform] Act [Chapter 9:23].\n\nHe was subsequently arrested before he was later cleared, resulting in him filing the present application.\n\nIn casu, in her statement to the police, Anna stated that on 8 May 2004, she received an anonymous call informing her that the plaintiff had demolished her house.\n\nOn the same day, she passed through the homestead and saw that indeed her seven-roomed, unroofed house had been demolished.\n\nThis is the information the defendant provided to the police.\n\nShe mentioned the plaintiff only as a suspect and informed the police that she did not seehimdemolishing the house.\n\nThe court heard she was candid that her information was based on an anonymous call she received.\n\nOn the premise of that account and the investigations, the police arrested and preferred a charge against the plaintiff.\n\nIn dismissing Collins claim, the judge said the decision to arrest and charge the plaintiff was exclusively that of the police.\n\nThe question whether she had a right or not to build a house at the homestead does not arise in this matter. It is irrelevant. The point is that she had a house at the Benyure homestead. Her house was demolished, and this is what she reported to the police. The conduct of the defendant cannot be said to amount to an active instigation of criminal proceedings, said the judge.\n\nIn addition, the judge said Collins affidavit of evidence merely recycles the contents of the summons and declaration.\n\nSuch is unhelpful. The allegation that the defendant made a false statement is not in sync with the facts of this case.\n\nThe demolished house was at the centre of the case; the police could not have arrested, and the prosecution could not have prosecuted the plaintiff if there had been no demolished house. There was a demolished house.\n\nBanda said there is no evidence that, besides giving information to the police, the defendant proceeded to lay a charge and was overbearing on the police to institute proceedings when they would not have otherwise done so.\n\nThe defendant in this case confined herself to giving information on what she believed transpired.\n\nHe said malice may be inferred from the absence of reasonable and probable cause to commence or continue a prosecution.\n\nIn other words, a want of reasonable and probable cause may be evidence of malice, where the court may conclude that there was no honest belief in the accusation made. In casu, there is no evidence of malice.\n\nIn other words, the plaintiff has not proved an absence of reasonable and probable cause operating on the mind of the defendant. Therefore, the plaintiff failed to prove the aspect of malice in the context of a claim for malicious prosecution, the court ruled.\n\n",

We filed a lot of complaints regarding the problems and risks posed by his dogs. Unfortunately, the more you reprimanded him, the more he would show his arrogant side, said one neighbour.\n\nWhen NewZimbabwe.com visited Bluffhill, a ramshackle kennel in which Mupinga kept his four dogs, the perimeter wall too short to secure the dangerous animals.\n\nEfforts to lobby authorities over the viciousness of the pitbulls fell on deaf ears, with officials turning a blind eye to Mupinga.\n\nElijah Machara, who was the first to find his uncles body, said the death had shaken the family.\n\nI was told by a neighbour to come and check on an unconscious body. When I got closer, I found Uncle Samuel dead. He had a deep cut on his neck, and my worst fear became reality  he was dead, said Machara.\n\nMachara is the latest victim in a rising number of fatal pitbull attacks, raising concerns about the safety and coexistence of pitbulls and people.\n\nAn estimated 12 countries worldwide have banned pitbull ownership, and there are growing calls for Zimbabwe to impose similar restrictions.\n\nHarare Mayor Jacob Mafume, in a social media post, said the City Council is working on regulating pitbulls.\n\nWe have raised concerns. We will explore whether, as council, we can stretch our mandate. Our position is that such dogs are dangerous and must be banned or strictly regulated  like how one would regulate a firearm, said Mafume.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nThe Umkhonto Wesizwe (MK) partys announcement on Tuesday thatFloyd Shivambu had been removed from his position as Secretary-Generalduring a press briefing has ignited debate about the stability and governance of the MK party, which has long been perceived as a volatile and informal organisation.\n\nDuring a tense press briefing in Durban, the party said the decision follows an internal investigation into Shivambus recent trip to Malawi, which officials say contravened the partys constitution and raised questions about leadership discipline within the organisation.\n\nAccording to MK party officials, Shivambus visit to Malawi to meet withfugitive pastor Shepherd BushirisEnlightened Church was the catalyst for his dismissal.\n\nThe partys statement confirmed that the trip was unauthorised and inconsistent with its constitutional guidelines, which explicitly prohibit members from engaging in activities that could undermine the partys integrity or expose it to external scrutiny.\n\nThe partys leadership cited the trip as emblematic of deeper systemic issues, namely, a leadership style characterised by unpredictability, casual decision-making, and a lack of institutional discipline.\n\nIndependent political analyst Sandile Swana weighed in on the implications of Shivambus removal, drawing parallels to the leadership patterns associated with former President Jacob Zuma.\n\nI have observed that part of the HR strategies of Jacob Zumawhere even when he was the President of the State, ministers and top officials were often removed abruptlymirror what we are seeing in the MK party, Swana said.\n\nIts a pattern of instability and informal governance. Leadership positions are often shifted overnight, with little transparency or consistency.\n\nSwana further argued that this informal style fosters an environment where leadership is unpredictable.\n\nThe character of the MK partys leadership resembles Zumas era  characterised by casualness and personal loyalty rather than institutional stability.\n\nThis creates a fragile political landscape where alliances are fleeting, and leadership is often driven by personal whims rather than strategic planning, he added.\n\nSanet Solomon, a political analyst from the University of the Free States Department of Political Studies and Governance, expressed concern about Shivambus removals broader implications.\n\nThe decision to recall Shivambu was not entirely unexpected, especially given the controversy surrounding his Malawi trip, she said.\n\nSuch actions risk alienating voters and could negatively impact the partys prospects in upcoming elections.\n\nSolomon criticised MKs apparent lack of precise succession planning, noting that the partys leadership operates casually and informally.\n\nThis pattern of instability suggests a leadership style that is personal rather than institutional, which can be detrimental to the partys credibility and long-term viability, she warned.\n\nThe ousting of Shivambu has raised questions about the future direction of the MK party. Analysts speculate the party may be heading into profound introspection or further instability.\n\nSome political commentators suggest that the leaderships decision to remove Shivambu rather than confront him publicly reflects a strategic attempt to avoid further internal dissent.\n\nHowever, critics argue that such moves only deepen the perception of disorder within the MK party, especially given the partys history of leadership upheaval and infighting.\n\nSwana pointed out the parallels between MKs leadership chaos and Zumas style of governance, adding another layer of complexity.\n\nThe informal and personal nature of MKs leadership echoes Zumas approach  where loyalty and personal connections often trump institutional norms, Swana said.\n\nThis could indicate that the party is becoming a mirror of Zumas political style, which may have long-term consequences for its stability.\n\n",

Hundreds of families fled their homes.\n\nAccording to the Zimbabwe Migrants Support Network (ZiMSN) chairperson Chris Mapingure, 127 people have now opted for voluntary repatriation after appearing in the Kirkwood Magistrates Court on Monday.\n\nThe Zimbabwean consulate is arranging transport back to Zimbabwe.\n\nMapingure condemned the arrests coming so soon after the xenophobic attacks. People had lost loved ones and some lost their property. Most lost their travel documents and will need time and money to replace the documents. This is unfair and unfortunate. People were supposed to be given an opportunity to collect their belongings and time to mourn and bury the dead.\n\nPolice spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge told GroundUp that the arrests were conducted by immigration officers from the Department of Home Affairs and the South African Police Service only provided the holding cells.\n\nThe deadly xenophobic attacks last weekend are under investigation by police. There have been no arrests.\n\nWarrant officer Majola Nkohli told GroundUp charges of intimidation and conspiracy to commit crime had been added to the docket. There is information coming out, some in the form of voice notes, which have been elements of intimidation and conspiracy to commit crime during the unrest, Nkohli said.\n\nThe leader of the South African National Civic Organisation (SANCO) in the Sundays River Valley, Patrick Bayeni, said the situation in Addo has calmed down and it is safe for the remaining Zimbabwean families to return.\n\nWe have members on the ground there to monitor the situation and assure whoever wants to return to come back without any fear, he said.\n\nHe said the father of the South African man whose murder triggered the violent revenge attacks has also urged the community not to harm immigrant community members.\n\nGroundUp sent questions to the Department of Home Affairs and Minister of Home Affairs Leon Schreiber but had received no response at the time of publication.\n\n",
