            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nINFORMATION Ministry Permanent Secretary, Nick Mangwana has claimed that government has not, at any given time, ordered a ban on Winky Ds songs being played on State-controlled radio stations.\n\nBorn Wallace Chirimuko, Winky D, has faced intense scrutiny ever since the release of his album Eureka Eureka, which features tracks like Ibotso and Dzimba Dzamabwe, alongside his latest 2025 songs Kudhakwa and Propaganda which all remain blacklisted from the State media.\n\nMangwana revealed these statements during an interview with DJ Ollah 7 stating his personal aversion to Winky Ds songs stating he finds them not original questioning the legitimacy of an artist, who uses Jamaican intonation.\n\nDo you wanna have this conversation?, I find nothing original in that. I dont understand someone who comes from Zimbabwe, stays in Zimbabwe, grew up in Zimbabwe and tries to talk Patwa, because Patwa was only spoken by the slaves.\n\nPatwa also came along during the times they spent in the plantations and thats the only language they could speak.\n\nEven in Jamaica its spoken but those who didnt learn, so why would someone from Zimbabwe speak Patwa?. I love something which is authentic, yes I love reggae I will listen to reggae, I love dancehall I will listen to the real dancehall, then when we are in Zimbabwe I want to listen to something that is Zimbabwean.\n\nIm not a fan but I dont say what he does is bad, but for my taste Im not a fan, said Mangwana\n\nOllah posed a question that the people, or rather the government, portray Winky D as someone who fights the government through his word play in songs and there was a time that radio stations stopped playing his songs.\n\nIf he fights it, would he win? When was it? Was I the Permanent Secretary? Because if I was the Permanent Secretary we are the ones who can do that but we never did that and we dont know it.\n\nWe dont even talk about him, somebody is out there trying to earn a living, we allow them to earn a living. Our lives are not defined on binary lines, that its either you are for or against or you are pro Zanu PF, no it doesnt define our lives, we are human beings first, Zimbabweans second and then whatever follows, said Mangwana.\n\nFurthermore, Mangwana dismissed that the government and the traditional media doesnt do propaganda.\n\nThey are wrong, we dont do propaganda, traditional media doesnt do propaganda, what it does is it gives information of course in any information giving you certain ideals that you are promoting and certain agendas that you would want to push but thats not propaganda.\n\nIts just like right now if we call someone to come and talk about anti-drugs, is he giving anti-drugs propaganda? So, if we come and talk about the beauty of the Second Republic, we are not giving propaganda we are just making you see that the Second Republic is something else, argued Mangwana.\n\n",

They feel like they are running on empty.\n\nWriting on his X account under the pseudonym Jamwanda 2, Charamba acknowledged the credibility of the lecturers cause, stating it warrants immediate attention.\n\nFrankly our university lecturers have a genuine grievance. I will take it up! Charamba declared.\n\nSelf-exiled former Higher and Tertiary Education Minister Professor Jonathan Moyo did not mince his words, accusing the government and UZ management of colluding to condemn lecturers to poverty. He branded their poor wages a national disgrace. He said the current state of affairs is a recipe for disaster.\n\nThe university authorities and the ministry cannot escape the indictment that their inability to redress the situation is a shocking administrative failure and abuse of duty, which has resulted in an intolerable violation of the human dignity of the academic staff at state universities, Moyo wrote on his X feed Friday.\n\nNot only is this a national embarrassment, but it is also a threat to the countrys economic interests with national security implications, Moyo added.\n\nMoyo, who previously championed Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) policy implementation as Minister of Higher and Tertiary Education, further stated that it is entirely impossible for Zimbabwe to develop economically without adequate support for academic staff across state universities, who are naturally implementing STEM initiatives at tertiary institutions.\n\nIt would be impossible for Zimbabwe to defeat the enemies of the people, namely; hunger, poverty, disease, ignorance and corruption without the kind of intellectual property that can only come from higher education; particularly but not only through Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM), Moyo wrote.\n\nWhile the UZ academic staff have been languishing in enforced poverty due to the unilateral slashing of their salaries in 2018, the AUT alleges that the UZ management has simultaneously awarded itself lavish packages, including luxury cars and hefty US dollar perks, whilst prioritising non-essential projects at the expense of the welfare and working conditions of the academic staff.\n\nThey said the UZ management seem to be living in a different world.\n\nThe current reduced salary of US$230 includes a local currency component, averaging ZWG 6,000 to 8,000, which amounts to less than US$200.\n\nThe lecturers strike is continuing outside the UZ campus premises, with numbers visibly increasing by the day.\n\nThe AUT members are vowing to continue with the protest until the government and UZ management find a lasting solution.\n\nNewZimbabwe.com understands that all academic services have been suspended at UZ as lecturers continue to demand their pre-October 2018 salaries of US$2,250.\n\n",

She touched so many hearts wherever we went, and everyone adored her.\n\nEvery part of being her dad was amazing.

            "content": "ByIsaacEdotomDzokpo\n\nFrance still refuses to acknowledge its involvement in planting millions of landmines across Algerian territory during the colonial war. According to Algerian experts, the maps handed over in 2007 are outdated and no longer reflect the actual locations of the explosive devices. This silence has become deadly: every step on the ground could lead to tragedy, and the country is left to confront this threat on its own.\n\nOn April 4, the UN Human Rights Council unanimously and without a votesupported a resolutioncalling on countries to comply with the 1997 treaty banning the use of mines, to protect and ensure human rights.\n\nThe initiative was spearheaded by Algeria, which is most familiar with the effects of the mine threat.\n\nHowever, 1956 through 1962, during the Algerian War of Independence, France laid 11 million mines along Algerias eastern and western borders.\n\nThe anti-personnel mines left behind by French colonialism represent one of Algerias greatest humanitarian disasters. Buried under Algerian soil, these mines continued to kill and maim the local population even after the national liberation war, Cameroons Africa Plus News television channel said on April 6.\n\nOn the same day when this statement was made  April 6, in Azerbaijan (a co-sponsor country of the UN resolution)as a result oftwo incidents of mine blast 4 people were injured at once.\n\nIn thefirst case an employee of the demining center, who had his leg amputated as a result.In the second, a father with two young children, aged 11 and 13, suffered multiple shrapnel wounds to their legs and arms.\n\nAzerbaijan isthe second most mine-contaminatedcountry in Europe after Ukraine.\n\nFor almost 30 years, parts of Azerbaijan have been occupied by Armenia, Frances closest ally. With the support of its patrons, Armenia laid more than 1.5 million mines there, which have claimed the lives of civilians to this day.\n\nAlgeria and Azerbaijan  a common echo of explosions\n\nTo prevent the infiltration of Algerian revolutionaries and weapons from Tunisia and Morocco during the Algerian War of Independence, minefields were established by the French colonial power along the 1,710 kilometers of Algerias eastern and western borders. As a result, 3 million Algerians living in the border areas were displaced.\n\nSince then, 7,300 civilians have fallenvictimto mines in Algeria, 4,830 of them during the war and 2,470 since independence.\n\nDespite the fact that Algeria has cleared more than 62,000 hectares of land, cleared nearly 9 million mines and declared itself an anti-personnel mine-free country in 2017, thereare stillcases of villagers, farmers and children being blown up.\n\nIt is alleged that France did not hand over maps with the location of minefields to Algeria until 2007. And when it did hand over  the maps were not complete.There are more than 2,200,000 of them [mines], and France has so far handed us only part of the maps showing where they are planted. As for humanity, Mr. President Macron, while you aretalking about human values, there are citizens who have had limbs amputated and those who have died because of these mines. Not a day goes by that we dont hear about a mine explosion that injured a person, and we are already living in 2025! said former Algerian politician Ahmed Khalifa on April 6.\n\nThe situation in Algeria is strikinglysimilar tothe situation in Azerbaijan, which is thousands of kilometers away. From 1991 to 2020, part of Azerbaijani territories was under Armenian occupation. During this time, more than3,400people suffered from mines laid by Armenians.\n\nIn 2020. Azerbaijan managed to regain control over the occupied territories, but this did not solve the problem ofminecontamination. Since 2020, more than390people have fallen victim to mines.\n\nHasanliAliyev, who had his leg amputated as a result of the blast, recalled onEuronews:I was 23 years old when I stepped on a mine. Like any young man, I had big dreams and goals. The mine explosion had a huge impact on my life.\n\nArmenia, like its patron France in the Algerian situation, initially claimed it did not have maps of the minefields, and when it did hand them over, they were only 25% accurate. A spokesman for the Azerbaijani Foreign Ministry said on April 4 thatmore than 55% of recent mine accidents occurred in territories not covered by these maps.\n\nSince 2020. Armenia and Azerbaijan have been negotiating a final peace treaty. But the normalization of relations between these countries does not correspond to the interests of France, which seeks to maintain a hotbed of tension in the South Caucasusin order tohave leverage over the countries of the region.\n\nTherefore, while Baku and Yerevan are holding peace talks, France is supplying offensive weapons to Armenia, which may provoke a new conflict in the region.\n\nIn June 2024, during the visit of the Armenian Defense Minister to France, the parties signed a contract for thesupplyof French CAY CAESAR howitzers to Armenia.\n\nAn agreement on military-technical cooperation was also signed between the Armenian Defense Ministry and KNDS military-industrial company, which produces various types of military equipment, including tanks and self-propelled artillery systems. France has also initiated the dispatch of a European observation mission to Armenias border with Azerbaijan, which is essentially engaged in intelligence activities there.\n\nFrance its alleged to have pursued a similar policy in Africa, where it has repeatedly been accused of using the pretext of a terrorist threat to maintain its presence there.\n\nFor decades, France has maintained influence in its former colonies by supporting and protecting loyalist regimes from military coups, using the pretext of fighting terrorism in the Sahel region to deploy its own troops, and imposing the CFA franc. The main goal of Paris in this case was to maintain access to natural resources of African countries and to establish control over their financial system. Experts estimate that France receives 500 billion dollars annually from Africa.\n\nCompensation for Mine Terror\n\nDue to the growing mine threat in the world, especially after the start of the Russian-Ukrainian war, there are increasing calls for a ban on the use of anti-personnel mines, as well as compensation for their victims.\n\nThe Mine Justice Campaign waslaunchedat the 58th session of the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva. Its aim is to get the UN Human Rights Council to recognize the right of mine victims to compensation  both from the companies that produce mines and the governments that lay them.\n\nAlgeria has for several years been calling on France to compensate victims of mines laid by French colonial rule in Algeria.The crime of the French colonizer cannot go unpunished,BouzidLazhari, head of the Algerian National Council for Human Rights,saidin 2021, urging Algerians to continue their fight for compensation. France has completely ignored these calls.\n\nAt the same time, Azerbaijan carries out demining at its own expense and calls on the international community to hold Armenia responsible for the mine terror against Azerbaijan.\n\nHowever, given the fact that Armenia has not yet handed over maps with the exact location of minefields in the previously occupied territories, it is apparently too early to talk about paying compensation to the victims.\n\n",
