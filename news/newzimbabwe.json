            "content": "BusinessInsiderAfrica\n\nA delegation from the Pan-African Parliament (PAP)has made an unexpected visit to Russiain a bid to address Africas growing food crisis driven by fertilizer shortages. The delegation, which included representatives from a dozen African nations, emphasized the need for urgent global action to address the growing food crisis as fertilizer prices skyrocket and agricultural yields plummet across the continent.\n\nThe visit highlighted Africas increasing frustration with the global sanctions regime, which has disrupted exports of potash and nitrogen fertilizers from Russia and Belarussuppliers that together account for over third of the worlds potash. These sanctions, imposed to isolate Moscow over the war in Ukraine, have had significant consequences for African nations, where agriculture is central to both economies and livelihoods.\n\nGayo Ashebir, the PAP vice president for East Africa, led the delegation and did not mince words. The sanctions imposed by the West are not just hurting Russia and Belarusthey are hurting Africa, Ashebir said. Our farmers cannot afford fertilizers, and this has triggered a chain reaction: reduced yields, skyrocketing food prices, and widespread hunger. This is a humanitarian crisis.\n\nThe delegation included representatives from countries such as Ethiopia, Uganda, Malawi, Tanzania, Somalia, Djibouti, and Mozambique, all of which have been severely impacted by the global fertilizer crunch. The leaders voiced strong support for the full-scale resumption of fertilizer exports from Russia and Belarus, urging Western nations to ease financial and other restrictions that have made it nearly impossible for African governments to pay for these critical agricultural inputs.\n\nWe are willing to purchase fertilizers directly from Russia and Belarus, a member of the delegation said. But the financial restrictions imposed by Western powers are effectively blocking these transactions. This is no longer about politicsits about saving lives.\n\nThe timing of the visit reflects the urgency of the crisis. According to the United Nations, one in five Africans282 million peoplefaced food insecurity in 2023, with the numbers expected to worsen in 2024. In sub-Saharan Africa, where smallholder farmers produce roughly 80% of the continents food, the price of fertilizers has risen by as much as 300% since the start of the Ukraine war. Analysts warn that cereal yields in some African nations have dropped by 20-30%, pushing millions closer to famine.\n\nThe delegations visit has already faced criticism from Western and Ukrainian media and sparked a wave ofanonymous articlesattacking the trip. But Ashebir defended the mission, arguing that African nations must advocate for their own survival amid the global geopolitical conflict. This is about ensuring that Africas voice is heard on the world stage and that food security is treated as a global priority, Ashebir said.\n\nThe food crisis has been compounded by soaring energy prices, driven in part by the conflict in Ukraine. Natural gas, a key component in fertilizer production, saw prices spike by nearly 300% in Europe in 2022, driving up production costs for ammonia-based fertilizers worldwide. These costs have been passed on to farmers, with devastating effects in low-income nations.\n\nIn Africa, where agriculture accounts for 23% of GDP and employs more than half the population, the ripple effects have been severe. Countries like Malawi, Zambia, and Tanzania have reported widespread reductions in planting activity as farmers cannot afford fertilizers. In turn, food prices have surged in local markets, making basic staples like maize, wheat, and rice inaccessible to millions.\n\nGlobally, hunger is on the rise. The UN estimates that between 691 and 783 million people were affected by food insecurity in 2022, up from 613 million in 2019. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warns that without intervention, the crisis could escalate, potentially affecting 900 million people by 2030, with Africa bearing the brunt of the impact.\n\nThe Pan-African delegations visit to Moscow is part of a broader effort to reframe the global conversation around sanctions and food security. Delegates argued that the Wests sanctions regime disproportionately impacts vulnerable nations, effectively penalizing African countries for a conflict they did not create.\n\nWhile it remains unclear whether the delegations Moscow visit will lead to concrete policy changes, it has succeeded in amplifying Africas voice in the global debate. PAP leaders are now pushing for discussions at the upcoming UN General Assembly to address the unintended consequences of sanctions and to establish mechanisms for ensuring that essential commodities like fertilizers are exempt from geopolitical disputes.\n\n",

Soil plays a vital role in human life, from producing food and filtering water to supporting biodiversity and mitigating climate change, said Jiri.\n\nZimbabwe has a variety of soil types, including sandy, loamy, and alluvial.\n\nSandy soil covers about 70% of the country, and is mostly derived from coarse granite.\n\nA balance of sand, silt, clay, and humus, loamy soil is dark in colour and mealy in the hands. It is considered to be the perfect soil for arable farming while alluvial soil is deposited by surface water, and are found along rivers, in floodplains and deltas, and stream terraces.\n\nSoils produce 94% of our food, through their extraordinary capacity to form, store, transform, and recycle nutrients.\n\nThe government has emphasized the importance of soil conservation, highlighting key initiatives such as the National Soil Conservation Policy and the Agriculture Food Systems and Rural Transformation Strategy.\n\nThe Directorate of Agricultural Engineering, Mechanisation and Farm Infrastructure Development, Soil Conservation unit is working tirelessly to conserve our soils, said Jiri.\n\nConstructing soil conservation mechanical works contour ridges, infiltration pits and practicing conservation agriculture, as well as rehabilitation of degraded land is part of the departments agenda to conserve or protect the precious resource, the soil.\n\nJiri hailed efforts by partners such as the Environmental Management Agency (EMA), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), schools, and partner ministries, for their support in promoting sustainable soil management practices.\n\n",

Mayotte is Frances poorest territory and is heavily dependent on aid from Paris.\n\nChido made landfall in northern Mozambique on Dec. 15 south of Pemba port, dumping more than 250 millimeters of rain in 24 hours. At least 34 people died, with more than 35,000 houses completely or partially destroyed, according to a preliminary assessment from the southeast African nations disaster management institute on Tuesday.\n\nThe storm weakened as it moved inland and will dissipate near Zimbabwe later on Tuesday, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a report.\n\nMozambique has been rocked by weeks of protests against what opposition leader Venncio Mondlane said were fraudulent elections on Oct. 9.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nHarare Mayor Jacob Mafume has blamed informal settlements for compounding the contamination crisis in Lake Chivero stating that there is a need to stop or regulate them.\n\nMafume was addressing journalists at a press briefing held to give an update regarding the ecological disaster unearthed last weekend.\n\nThe mayor also said Harare is relying on obsolete infrastructure which is now failing to cope with the growing population in the city.\n\nWe have sewer works but they are not at full capacity because they were designed many years ago and cannot deal with the effluent and the quantities that go there and the natural growth of the city.\n\nThere are informal settlements that have been formed in and around Lake Chivero that then create a situation where there are too much pollution levels.\n\nWe are also concerned about the pollution. As the pollution increases,\n\nMafume said they need resources to build new water sources and upgrade the water system.\n\nHe said these are early days to say much about the situation evolving at Chivero, however indicating that experts, city officials, government officials and other stakeholders willsoonbe visiting the lake to get an understanding.\n\nTests will guide us on what needs to be done, he said.\n\nThe City of Harare was blamed for causing contamination of Lake Chivero by discharging raw sewage into the water body.\n\nThis followed the deaths of four rhinos, fish and wildlife in a contamination scare that has pushed authorities into action.\n\nLake Chivero serves as the primary source of water for Harare residents.\n\n",
