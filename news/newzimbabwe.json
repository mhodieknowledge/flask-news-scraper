Its effectively a lie and the only reason Mr. Carter is even involved in this is because she was pushed to involve him.\n\nIn a sworn declaration, the accuser has insisted she stands by her claims and only dropped her lawsuit due to fear of intimidation and retaliation from Jay-Z and his fans.\n\nShe denied telling the investigators Buzbee had sought her out as a client or encouraged her to pursue a false claim but argued she felt intimidated and terrified at being confronted on her doorstep.\n\nBut Spiro insisted the investigators didnt coerce or threaten the woman.\n\nHe said: She voluntarily met and spoke to them and she told them her truth, which was under no circumstances did Mr. Carter do this, and number two the only reason hes even involved in this is she was pushed to introduce him by a lawyer.\n\nMr. Carter doesnt know Jane Doe, never met Jane Doe. Theres no truth to any of this.\n\nJay is suing both his accuser and her lawyer for defamation, which they have denied, and is ready to move forward with his life.\n\nHis lawyer said: Its tough to hear a false lie said about you, spread through the internet, and affecting your children.\n\nIts tough on him. Its tough on anybody. But what he does is he proves himself innocent. Today is hopefully the final chapter in that. And then theyre gonna move forward. Thats what Jay does.\n\nThe truth had to fully come out. This person cannot be allowed to sort of hide from the reality that this was a false accusation.\n\nIn Jays lawsuit, he claimed the allegations of rape against him were knowingly false and malicious and accused the woman and his lawyers of having launched to extort him through a menacing private demand letter.\n\n",

The next thing is, you say the government is not providing a service; what contribution have you made?\n\nSo, first and foremost, all kombis must be registered, and kombi operators must lead by example in their operations by being responsible Zimbabweans, said the ZRP spokesman.\n\nOn enforcement of the law, Nyathi said all police officers are under instructions to carry out their duties professionally in accordance with police standards.\n\nZRP will take action against any police officer who will try to endanger the lives of Zimbabweans, Nyathi added.\n\nIn some instances, police officers have been blamed for road traffic accidents as they smash windscreens and chase after fleeing commuter omnibuses.\n\nMotorists were urged to comply with police officers and avoid running away.

Furthermore, the accumulation of waste from these vendors has rendered some roads, sanitary lanes, and sidewalks impassable, exacerbating public health and security issues,said Garwe.\n\nMoreover, the proliferation of illegal vending has created a haven for criminal activities, including theft, robbery, and drug dealing, posing a direct threat to the safety of residents and visitors alike.\n\nIn light of these pressing issues, the government is directing all local authorities to clear vendors from undesignated points within 48 hours.\n\nSpeaking at the same press conference, Harare Mayor Jacob Mafume said, There is no permission of night vending, and even during the daytime, there are laws that control the vending.\n\nPeople are not supposed to operate anywhere and everywhere in the streets were they see fit to light fires, throwing litter, blocking drainages. There are designated areas, and normally those areas are around the bus terminals where they should operate.\n\nLast year, health services director Prosper Chonzi confessed that the Harare City Council had failed to deal with illegal vending because of the state of Zimbabwes economy.\n\nThe general economy is playing against us; we have been playing hide and seek after vendors, and it is not working, Chonzi said then.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Mutapa Investment Fund (MIF) has devoted efforts to turn around the fortunes of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) which had been relegated to the corporate graveyards.\n\nZimbabwes first Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWF) origins can be traced back to a mining sector policy study conducted in2012that recommended the establishment of the fund to drive long-term investment leveraging on mining, natural and other resources that would anchor inclusive economic growth and development.\n\nFormerly the SWF, the MIF was established by an Act of Parliament in 2014 called the Sovereign Wealth Fund Act (Chapter 22:20). In September 2023, it was renamed to Mutapa Investment Fund through Statutory Instrument 156 of 2023 by President Emmerson Mnangagwa using the Presidential Powers (Temporary Measures Act).\n\nMIF chief executive officer, Dr John Mangudya, told state controlled media that said strategies to turn around some parastatals were employed in the funds first year of existence.\n\nMIF is working on with its investee companies including putting in place a package for the procurement of buses by ZUPCO to augment Public transport.\n\nWorking with the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) to rehabilitate rail infrastructure and rolling stock, promoting rewarding Joint Ventures especially in the mining sector, developing sustainable operational models at Cottco, Silo Foods, Air Zimbabwe and the Cold Storage Commission (CSC), he said.\n\nThe entities mentioned by Mangudya were largely viewed as dead due to bad corporate governance with very little to offer to the countrys fiscus after degenerating into tiny shadows of their former selves before the coming in of the MIF, prompting many to regard the current initiatives as mammoth graveyard resurrection efforts.\n\nMIF CEO said the fund has made great strides within the first year of its operations geared to transform the economic and financial performance of portfolio companies under its purview in order to drive sustainable growth and development.\n\nApart from rescuing the ailing companies, the fund has also completed a diagnostic assessment of its investee companies and has come up with a strategic plan to catalyse national building by the entities under MIF.\n\nFor instance, the fund is closely working with the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) to enhance energy security in Zimbabwe through various initiatives that include prepaid metering, net metering, smart metering and enhancing base load through the implementation of independent power producers projects that include rehabilitating of Hwange Units 1 to 6 aimed at increasing electricity by around 600MW.\n\nThe fund is also focusing on strengthening board effectiveness, performance management and client centric across its entities. Also, we are working on enhancing value for money practices by optimizing capital management and practices within the group, added Mangudya.\n\n",
