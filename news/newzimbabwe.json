            "content": "By Alyssia Birjalal l lOL\n\nBRAZILIAN football superstar Neymar da Silva Santos Jnior, popularly known as Neymar Jr., has reportedly been named the sole heir to a massive fortune left by an unidentified Brazilian billionaire.\n\nOnline reports have confirmed that Neymar is set to inherit about R20 billion, despite having never met the deceased billionaire, whose identity remains a mystery.Brazilian local media outlet RIC stated that the will was formalised in Porto Alegre on June 12, with two witnesses present to authenticate the document; however, the final decision on whether Neymar will officially become the heir lies with Brazilian courts.The deceased businessman reportedly chose Neymar because he felt a personal connection to the global football star.Local reports mention that the businessman admired the footballers values as well as his close relationship with his father, Neymar Sr, which apparently reminded him of his own bond with his late father.In his will, the businessman reportedly said: I like Neymar, I identify with him a lot. Hes not self-serving, which is something rare these days.In addition to cash inheritance, Neymar is reportedly set to receive other valuable assets, including properties, investments and shares in major companies.According to Forbes, the father of two already places third as one of the richest athletes globally.He boasts a net worth of approximately R6 billion, following closely behind Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi.The unexpected inheritance will very well put him ahead of the two footballers.In other news, after a challenging stint at Saudi Arabian club Al-Hilal, Neymar has returned to his roots at Santos FC, where he began his professional journey.Upon his return, Neymar expressed his deep connection to Santos: I made a decision and I listened to my heart. Santos is not just my team, it is my home, my roots, my history and my life. Here I was, a boy who became a man, and I am truly loved.Here I can be myself, truly happy. And it is here that I want to fulfil the dreams that are missing in my career. And nothing will stop me. I go, I come back, and I stay.
