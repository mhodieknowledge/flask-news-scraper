            "content": "News24\n\nThe African Unions (AU) mission to the US has engaged the services of a Florida-based lobby group to urge the Trump administration to lift targeted sanctions on senior Zimbabwean officials, including that of the countrys, President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nA Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA) filing from December last year shows that the AU mission engaged lobby group Ford and London Global Strategies, in a bid to lift targeted sanctions on Zimbabwe and foster a renewed partnership between the US and Zimbabwe.\n\nZimbabwe and the AU have long called for all sanctions to be lifted.The FARA filing shows that the AUs mission is optimistic that the Trump administration might be more receptive to this request than the Biden White House.\n\nAU ambassador to the US, Hilda Suka-Mafudze, wrote in an email to the lobby group last year that lifting sanctions on Zimbabwean individuals and entities would benefit the US by securing vital resources, creating economic opportunities for US businesses, and reasserting American leadership in southern Africa.\n\nShe pitched the idea that bilateral trade and investment agreements could prioritise US businesses under the America First strategy, ensuring US firms have preferential access to Zimbabwes markets and resources. Suka-Mafudzes email sets out the key messages she wants the lobby group to take to its meeting with team Trump. One of her proposals includes the line: Countering Chinese Influence.\n\nSuka-Mafudze writes that the US could benefit from Zimbabwes strategic location in Southern Africa, its critical minerals, and its workforce while reducing the regions dependence on Chinese investments. Aligning with Zimbabwe could counterbalance Chinas growing influence in the region and open avenues for US investments in agriculture, mining, and infrastructure, she adds.\n\nChina is one of Zimbabwes largest trading partners. According to the Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe, bilateral trade between China and Zimbabwe was upwards of $3.8bn, in 2024.\n\nThe US first sanctioned Zimbabwe in 2001 under the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act. This suite of sanctions was based on allegations of political repression, election rigging, land seizures, and corruption under former President Robert Mugabe.\n\nFormer US President Joe Biden ended this sanctions programme in March last year, unblocking all individuals, entities, and property previously affected.\n\nHowever, the US then proceeded to impose new targeted sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Programme on 11 individuals and three entities.\n\nThose sanctioned included Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, first lady Auxillia Mnangagwa, and first Vice-President Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nThe US has hit back against claims that the sanctions are responsible for Zimbabwes economic woes, saying they target only a handful of Zimbabweans.\n\n",

He said Tshabangu had breached the partys constitution rules and regulations in that he brazenly defied the authority of the President of the CCC, the National Standing Committee, the National Executive Committee, and the National Council.\n\nOn the second count, Tshabangu was found guilty of making public pronouncements on changes to party representatives in parliament without first seeking the approval of the President of the CCC or its organs, namely the National Standing Committee, the National Executive Committee, and the National Council.\n\nOn the third count, the CCC stated that Tshabangu had brought the name and reputation of the party into disrepute by making changes in Parliament without the approval of the party organs.\n\nOn the fourth count, Tshabangu was found guilty of disrespecting the office of the President of the CCC and its organs by making derogatory remarks in the public media, where he made statements after his suspension from the party.\n\nHaving found Sengezo Tshabangu guilty of all the charges, and having regard to the gravity of the acts of misconduct of which the Committee convicted him, the Committee decided to sentence him to expulsion from the party with immediate effect, part of Madzimures statement reads.\n\nMadzimure added that he was uncertain whether Tshabangu would appeal, but implied that this expulsion could follow to give him a taste of his own medicine because he was the one who started the purging of party representatives from Parliament and local authorities.\n\nNewZimbabwe.com made efforts to reach Tshabangu, but he did not answer his mobile phone.\n\nHowever, one of his lawyers, Kucaca Phulu, confirmed that Tshabangu had appeared before the CCC party Disciplinary Committee but said he was not the one who spoke on behalf of Tshabangu and directed questions to fellow lawyer Nqobani Sithole.\n\nWhen reached for comment, Sithole rubbished the disciplinary Committee, its verdict, and its sentence, describing it as a charade. They do not have that power. They do not have structures. Structures that can exercise that power are not in existence at the moment. It is a charade, he stated.\n\nWhen asked why Tshabangu had appeared before a committee that he described as a charade, Sithole said his client had appeared to simply tell them that they are a charade.\n\nLast December, Ncubes group dragged Tshabangu to the High Court for pronouncing parliamentary changes without consulting his party organs. The High Court ruled in favour of Ncubes group before Tshabangu appealed the same ruling at the Supreme Court. The matter is yet to be heard.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nCITIZENS Coalition for Change (CCC) legislator Darlington Chigumbu has said that the governments initiative to compensate former white farmers overlooks the disadvantaged black workers who toiled on the farms.\n\nThe government recently announced that it is disbursing US$20 million to farmers who were displaced as a result of the land reform process aimed at addressing historical injustices in the early 2000s.\n\nThe 94 farmers, hailing from countries such as Switzerland and Germany, are covered under Bilateral Investment Protection and Promotion Agreements (BIPPAs) that Zimbabwe signed with the farmers countries of origin.\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncube said that the compensation is for the developments the farmers carried out on the farms prior to their displacement.\n\nSpeaking in the National Assembly recently, Chigumbu argued that the programme is ignoring the historical injustices suffered by native workers while developing the farms.\n\nIt is a good thing that our country is honouring its commitments. I would want to bring to the attention of this House that we need to be cognisant of the fact that there are some historical injustices that happened as these people acquired the land. It is a good thing that the Ministry is saying they are paying these people for the developments that were made on the land that was repossessed around 2000.\n\nHowever, they should also not be blind to the fact that the developments that these people are now being paid for, actually came as a result of labour practises that were near to slavery and our grandfathers are no longer there to be part and parcel or to also claim with these farmers to say they also contributed to the development of that particular piece of land as well as not being treated fairly.\n\nIt is also sad that this whole arrangement seems not to be taking into consideration these people who participated in the development of these particular pieces of land, said Chugumbu.\n\nThe government has faced criticism from opposition groups for compensating landowners whose land was forcibly taken from local inhabitants during the colonial era.\n\nChigumbu further suggested that there should be a mechanism to ensure that the native workers who laboured on these farms are also compensated.\n\nThe third aspect is that when the land was re-distributed, the big guys are the ones who took parts of the farm land which was properly developed and l can tell that they are not part and parcel of this whole arrangement.\n\nMy prayer is that can this arrangement include a model whereby these people who are going to receive the payments of the developments that they have done on these pieces of land also pay the people who worked on these pieces of land, which they were not paid fairly during the time they were working on these pieces of land?\n\nI understand most of these people are no longer alive but is it not also prudent Mr. Speaker Sir, to say that they can give back to the communities where their farms are located so that they can also pay something? The reason would be because they are now benefiting from something they did not pay for in as much as we are talking about the developments that were done on the pieces of land that they are now being paid for, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nRapper A$AP Rocky has been found not guilty of firing a gun at a former friend.\n\nA jury in Los Angeles acquitted the musician, whose legal name is Rakim Mayers, on two felony assault charges that carried up to 24 years in prison.\n\nTerell Ephron claimed the Grammy-nominated hip-hop star opened fire at him during an argument on a Hollywood street on 6 November 2021, grazing his knuckles with one of the shots.\n\nMr Mayers, who is also a fashion mogul and the longtime partner of pop star Rihanna, denied the charges, arguing that the weapon was a prop gun and that his former friend, who calls himself A$AP Relli, was only after money.\n\nAs the first not-guilty verdict was read on Tuesday, the court rang with screams and clapping. Mr Mayers rushed towards his family and Rihanna, who were seated behind him. He dived over a wooden barrier to embrace them.\n\nRihanna had been a repeated presence in court during the trial, and for Tuesdays verdict, brought along their two sons, two-year-old RZA and one-year-old Riot.\n\nMr Mayers also hugged his lawyers and appeared to have tears in his eyes as the second not-guilty verdict was read.\n\nThank God for saving my life, Mr Mayers said aloud. He thanked members of the 12-person jury.\n\nThe rapper was arrested on the two felony assault charges after a heated argument with his former friend in the heart of Hollywood.\n\nMr Mayers and Mr Ephron have known each other since high school in New York and were part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective.\n\nTheir friendship cooled as A$AP Rockys career took off.\n\nAuthorities said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November 2021, a day after the pair had a disagreement, outside a hotel about a block from the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nAn altercation ensued.\n\nMr Mayers was alleged to have pulled out a gun from his waistband and pointed it at Mr Ephron, telling him: Ill kill you right now.\n\nHe looked me in my eyes and pointed the gun at me, Mr Ephron testified.\n\nMr Ephron said he told the rapper to fire the weapon, but Mr Mayers started walking away. As he left, Mr Ephron followed, shouting at him.\n\nProsecutors alleged that at this point, Mr Mayers once again pulled out the gun and fired multiple shots, with one bullet said to have grazed Mr Ephrons knuckles.\n\nMuch of the trial hinged on whether the firearm in question was a harmless prop gun, as Mr Mayerss defence said, or a real weapon capable of causing harm, as Mr Ephron and prosecutors alleged.\n\nThe weapon has not been recovered by authorities.\n\nJurors were able to watch some footage of the altercation because parts were captured on surveillance video, including audio of gunfire, but no video evidence directly showed any shooting.\n\nMr Ephron took two days before reporting the incident to authorities and brought shell casings he said he had retrieved from the scene.\n\nBut police who responded to reports of a shooting in the area did not locate any shell casings. Mr Ephron, who said he returned with his girlfriend hours later, said he knew exactly where to look, but no surveillance footage corroborates his account.\n\nHe was not admitted to hospital in Los Angeles and instead went for medical treatment after flying back to New York.\n\nLawyers for Mr Mayers suggested that Mr Ephron had planted the shell casings to frame the rapper.\n\nThe trial was marked by emotional and combative exchanges, particularly when Mr Ephron  the trials star witness  took the stand.\n\nAt one point, Mr Ephron called Mr Tacopina  a defence attorney for Mr Mayers  annoying, which led to a reprimand from the judge.\n\nAnother witness, A$AP Twelvyy, was asked by prosecutors about a photograph showing Mr Mayerss bed with the letters AWGE emblazoned on the furniture.\n\nWhen asked what that stood for, Mr Mayers unexpectedly interrupted the proceedings and yelled, Dont say! Twelvyy ultimately refused to elaborate.\n\nOutbursts from defendants during trials are uncommon, especially in front of a jury.\n\nHowever, for a criminal suspect on trial to interject and instruct a witness not to answer a prosecutors question during cross-examination is something nearly unheard of in a court.\n\nThe rapper is set to release his first solo album in nearly a decade and is scheduled to co-headline Los Angeles Rolling Loud festival in March 2025.\n\nAdditionally, he stars alongside Denzel Washington in Spike Lees upcoming film Highest 2 Lowest, due to be released the coming months.\n\n",
