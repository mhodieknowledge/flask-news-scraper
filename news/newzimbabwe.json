            "content": "BBC\n\nMigrants who are in the UK legally could have to wait up to 20 years before they can settle permanently, under government proposals.\n\nThe Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood has announced the qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain will be extended from five to 10 years, and will apply to the estimated 2.6 million who arrived since 2021.\n\nThe changes will not apply to people who had already obtained settlement.\n\nMahmood said becoming part of the UK was not a right but a privilege  and one that must be earned.\n\nThe package is the latest in a string of changes to the immigration system announced by Mahmood over the past week.\n\nSettlement, also known as Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR), allows someone to live in the UK permanently, work without restrictions and access public services. It is also a key step towards British citizenship.\n\nCurrently, most work and family visa holders can apply for settlement after five years.\n\nUnder the proposed changes the standard wait will be 10 years  with a range of criteria that would lengthen or shorten that period.\n\nLegal migrants who claim benefits for less than 12 months will have to wait 15 years\n\nPeople who arrived on post-Brexit health and social care visas would have to wait 15 years, up from five year currently\n\nMigrants reliant on benefits for more than 12 months face a 20-year wait for settlement, four times more than the current period and the longest in Europe\n\nThere is also a reduction to three years for applicants who earn 125,140 in the three years prior to applying for settlement, with this reduced to five years for anyone earning 50,270.\n\nTime spent volunteering and competency in the English language are also factors which could reduce the wait.\n\nAnnouncing the changes in the Commons, Mahmood said: Migration will always be a vital part of Britains story.\n\nBut the scale of arrivals in recent years has been unprecedented.\n\nConservative shadow home secretary Chris Philp accused Labour of copying and pasting policies from his party that it had previously voted against.\n\nPhilp said his part would support the changes, but warned the new system could create loopholes and urged ministers to adopt a migration cap.\n\nReform UK did not respond to the statement in the Commons. But the party has previously announced it would abolish ILR  replacing it with visas that migrants must reapply for every five years.\n\nThat includes hundreds of thousands of migrants currently in the UK.\n\nHome Office figures show net migration added 2.6 million people to UK population between 2021 and 2024.\n\nBecause of this, settlement grants are also expected to spike over the next five years, with around 1.6 million people forecast to settle between 2026 and 2030.\n\nMinisters plan to introduce an earned settlement system, requiring migrants to demonstrate social integration, economic contribution and good character before being granted settled status.\n\nApplicants will need to meet stricter minimum requirements including the equivalent to A-level standard English language, a clean criminal record and earning above 12,570 a year for at least three years.\n\nThere will be accelerated routes for those who make an outsized contribution to the UK.\n\nDoctors and nurses working in the NHS will be able to settle after five years. The brightest and best international talent could have settlement fast-tracked, with high earners and entrepreneurs able to stay after just three years.\n\nFamily members will not gain automatic status when the main applicant qualifies. Children who came to the UK under the age of 18 may settle with parents, but older dependants could face separate requirements.\n\nExisting fast-track routes for victims of domestic abuse, bereaved partners and resettled refugees will remain.\n\nPublic service union Unison said the changes would be devastating to thousands of essential workers and put services at risk.\n\nChristina McAnea, Unisons general secretary, said: Forcing staff, many of whom stepped up during Covid, to wait 15 years for certainty about their futures betrays the promises they were made.\n\nMs McAnea warned the government not to overlook the care workers, nursing assistants and school support staff from overseas as without them care services would collapse.\n\nThe changes build on measures first set out in the governments May white paper.\n\nThe government plan to roll out changes from spring 2026, after a consultation ends on 12 February.\n\nOn Monday, Mahmood announced a sweeping overhaul of the UKs asylum system  including plans to end permanent refugee status and replace it with temporary status subject to review every 30 months.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nZANU PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa has rebuked controversial businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei over his recent remarks calling for foreign nationals to be excluded from investing in certain sectors of the economy, describing the comments as xenophobic.\n\nTagwirei recently told a ZANU PF meeting that foreigners should be removed from sectors such as transport, retail, and energy.\n\nIn response, Mutsvangwa warned Tagwirei against pushing sentiments that could evolve into a movement resembling South Africas anti-immigrant vigilante group, Operation Dudula.\n\nZimbabwe was founded on the support of Africa, the Africa liberation committee and one of the beneficiaries, as a young guerrilla was the current president. Africa matters to us as a country. So you do not go about saying we do not want foreigners in Zimbabwe.\n\nWe do not want Dudula here. We are an African country. Africans are not foreigners in Zimbabwe. If there are certain things that were being done by certain Africans, let them be handled by legal processes, said Mutsvangwa.\n\nThe Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act reserves sectors such as retail, employment agencies, and advertising for Zimbabwean citizens. The law is aimed at correcting longstanding economic imbalances, however, foreign nationals have increasingly encroached on these sectors.\n\nMutsvangwa said Zimbabweans should not mistreat foreigners, noting that many citizens themselves live abroad.\n\nWe are a mature brown stick country which has got a lot of respect for our African brethren and when they are here we treat them exactly as Zimbabweans. We are not xenophobic like South Africa. When you live in glass house do not throw stones. The third biggest foreign currency earner in this country is the diaspora. They are strangers in other lands, he said.\n\nMutsvangwas remarks also signalled a shift in tone towards Tagwirei, whom he recently supported for co-option into the ZANU PF Central Committee despite having previously criticised him for allegedly buying influence.\n\nIn a pointed remark, Mutsvangwa suggested that Tagwirei should consider enrolling at the partys Herbert Chitepo School of Ideology.\n\nCertain things are only said by the President. They are not said by everybody otherwise everyone who thinks can be a president can be seen giving polices from his platform.\n\nIt may not be too late particularly for people who want to be presidents to go back to Chitepo school of ideology. I have mentioned it before, he said.\n\nTagwirei has been reported to harbour presidential ambitions after President Emmerson Mnangagwas term ends in 2028.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has delivered a landmark ruling declaring parts of Zimbabwes restrictive abortion law unconstitutional, siding with the Community Working Group on Health (CWGH) and Member of Parliament Nyasha Batitsa, who brought the challenge with human-rights lawyer Tendai Biti.\n\nJustice Sylvia Chirawu-Mugomba ruled that the Termination of Pregnancy Act, enacted in 1977, unlawfully excludes mental-health risk as a ground for lawful termination and fails to protect women with mental disabilities from pregnancies resulting from sexual exploitation.\n\nThe statutory omission creates a discriminatory regime, the judge wrote, adding that forcing women to carry pregnancies that cause grave mental-health consequences violates their rights to dignity, equality, humane treatment, bodily autonomy, and health. She stressed that the Constitution recognises health as physical, mental, and psychological well-being.\n\nCourt sides with CWGH and Batitsa\n\nCWGH and Batitsa had challenged section 4(a) and the definition of unlawful intercourse in section 2(1), arguing the law ignored modern constitutional and medical understanding of health and erased the vulnerability of institutionalised mental-health patients who cannot legally consent to sex.\n\nIn their filing, they argued: Section 4(a) unlawfully confines lawful termination to threats to physical health, ignoring that health includes mental and psychological well-being. They also warned that excluding pregnancies arising from sexual exploitation of mental-health patients fails to safeguard the dignity and bodily integrity of a particularly vulnerable group.\n\nJustice Chirawu-Mugomba agreed, finding that the law erased their lack of capacity to consent and, as a consequence, denied them access to lawful termination even in circumstances amounting to abuse.\n\nThe Court declared the offending provisions unconstitutional, but suspended the declaration for 18 months and referred the matter to the Constitutional Court for confirmation.\n\nA shift in Zimbabwes reproductive-rights landscape\n\nThe ruling marks what the Court described as a move away from a narrow, biomedical model of abortion focused only on physical survival, toward a constitutional model grounded in dignity, equality, and holistic health.\n\nThe Courts effects-based analysis, drawing on comparative jurisprudence from South Africa and Canada, recognised mental health as an integral component of the constitutional right to health, and held that statutory frameworks must evolve with contemporary medical understanding.\n\nCWGH welcomes historic victory\n\nThe Community Working Group on Health welcomed the judgment, calling it a breakthrough for women whose suffering has long been invisible under the law.\n\nThis is a historic victory for reproductive justice, CWGH said in response to the ruling. The Court has affirmed that mental-health endangerment must be recognised alongside physical risk, and that women with mental disabilities are entitled to equal protection from sexual exploitation and its consequences.\n\nThe organisation said the decision creates a clear mandate for Parliament, health authorities, and civil society to ensure abortion services are accessible and responsive to the realities of women living with mental disabilities.\n\nNext steps for Parliament\n\nOnce the Constitutional Court confirms the ruling, Parliament will be required to amend the Termination of Pregnancy Act to include mental-health risk as a lawful ground for termination and expand the definition of unlawful intercourse to include sexual exploitation of mental-health patients, conduct already criminalised under the Mental Health Act.\n\nWith the judgment now on record, legal observers say Zimbabwe has taken a decisive step toward modernising reproductive-health law in line with constitutional values and regional obligations under the Maputo Protocol, CEDAW, and the African Charter.\n\n",

Economic shocks and inconsistent policies have eroded earnings, prompting a mass exodus of skilled professionals seeking better opportunities abroad.\n\nSenator Sithabisiwe Moyo recently tabled a motion in the Upper House demanding an immediate and comprehensive solution to address the worsening plight of government workers.\n\nThe situation on the ground is not fair. Our civil servants are suffering. Our teachers, nurses, clerks and other civil servants are living in poverty while struggling to do their jobs. For example, the average Zimbabwean teacher earns about 350 per month, which is not enough to pay rent or buy food, said Moyo.\n\nShe further urged the government to consider a 50% salary increase and to prioritise restoring wages to the 2018 standard.\n\nThe civil service is collapsing, Hon. President, we must give civil servants a salary increment now, approve an emergency salary increase so that the teachers, nurses and other civil servants earn enough to survive. A 50% increase would do, we must restore their salaries to that of the US dollar era value of 2019 and this should be a top priority, said Moyo.\n\nThe deteriorating working environment in public institutions has fuelled widespread disgruntlement among civil servants, undermining service deliveryparticularly for low-income communities that rely heavily on government services.\n\nMoyo cautioned against politicising the crisis.\n\nThe whole country is watching our civil servants; we are not asking for charity or politics, only the dignity of a living salary and support in order for them to do their work.\n\nTeachers want to teach, nurses want to do their work, all other civil servants want to deliver their duties efficiently, but how can they if they are hungry? We must not allow our Public Service to collapse. Children are travelling long distances to school because of a shortage of schools nearby. We owe the future generation because their future depends on us, she said.\n\n",

Thanks to this new technology that provided advanced imaging, the officials detected a concealed load, prompting a physical inspection, which uncovered 14 master boxes of Remington Gold cigarettes.\n\nThe BMA said the use of its new cargo scanner was decisive in detecting this illicit load, underscoring the value of continued investment in modern border control technology.\n\nThe efforts of our junior border guards continue to ensure coordinated, rapid response.
