They say the enclosure is too tiny while at times the stressed animals go without food and water.In response to the growing online concerns of poor animal welfare, ZimParks said plans are afoot to engage relevant teams and partners to address the issues raised.ZimParks acting spokesperson Tamiriraishe Mudzingwa said the two lions are receiving sufficient care and treatment despite being kept in separate enclosures.ZimParks remains committed to maintaining the highest standards of hospitality, safety, and conservation, the authority said.At present, there are two lions at Chinhoyi Caves: Dingani, a 13-year-old male, and Laila, a 6-year-old female.The two lions are currently housed separately, a decision made purely for their safety and wellbeing. This arrangement follows the males aggressive behaviour toward the female, and our teams are managing a gradual and carefully supervised reintroduction process, said Mudzingwa.The statement follows a plethora of social media posts alleging that two lions housed at Chinhoyi Caves are malnourished, poorly fed, and sometimes go without water. Critics also claimed the enclosures were too small, with some commentators describing the conditions particularly for the female lion as animal cruelty.ZimParks assured the public that its teams are monitoring the animals closely and that ongoing improvements are being made to address public concerns.\n\nVisitors to the Ramsar world heritage site at Chinhoyi Caves have raised concern online over the unfavorable conditions the two lions one named Dingani, a 13-year-old male, and Laila, a 6-year-old female are being kept.

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nCBZ Holdings, Zimbabwes largest financial services group by assets and deposits, has posted a 10% increase in profit after tax for the nine months ending 30 September 2025, reaching ZWG1.11 billion, up from ZWG1.01 billion in the same period last year.\n\nPresenting a trading update for the nine months ended 30 September 2025, CBZ Group Chief Legal Advisor and Governance, Rumbidzayi Jakanani, said the growth recorded comes as the countrys macroeconomic environment stabilises, with the ZWG holding steady against the US dollar and inflation easing into single digits.\n\nCBZ Group Chief Legal Advisor and Governance, Rumbidzayi Jakanani\n\nThe Group recorded a profit after tax of ZWG 1.11 billion, representing a 10% increase from ZWG1.01 billion recorded in the same period of the previous year. Total income amounted to ZWG4.23 billion, 58% above the ZWG 2.68 billion reported in the prior year, reflecting stable performance, she said.\n\nWhile the increase in profits may seem modest, it reflects CBZHs strong cost control and strategic diversification, as the bank navigates a period of monetary tightening and stable gold-backed reserves. This stability has allowed CBZH to focus on organic growth rather than hedge against extreme inflation volatility.\n\nTotal income surged 58% to ZWG 4.23 billion, up from ZWG 2.68 billion in 2024, with non-funded income contributing a significant 65% (ZWG 2.75 billion), reflecting a 54% increase year-on-year. This jump in non-interest income underscores CBZHs advantage in transactional banking, supported by its leading deposit base and robust digital channels, which have thrived amid growing electronic payment adoption and a stable exchange rate.\n\nFunded income also grew 66%, reaching ZWG 1.46 billion, as the bank selectively lent into higher-yielding sectors while maintaining strong asset quality, unlike some competitors who have struggled in volatile periods.\n\nThe balance sheet expanded 13% to ZWG 38.93 billion, with deposits rising by 25% to ZWG 27.09 billion. This strong growth in customer deposits has enabled CBZH to maintain a healthy loan-to-deposit ratio while maintaining high liquidity levels. The banks focus on stable, low-cost retail and corporate deposits has helped shield it from risks associated with short-term interbank funding.\n\nCapital adequacy remains strong, with all divisions meeting regulatory requirements. The bank is also planning fresh capital injections for its growth subsidiaries, positioning it for future opportunities in a fragmented market.\n\nLooking ahead, the global economy is expected to record moderate growth on the back of easing inflation, improving financial conditions, and technological productivity gains. The local economy is set to continue on the positive growth trajectory, supported by expected better rainfall season, higher prices for gold, improved energy supply, coupled with the ongoing fiscal reforms that will enhance the ease of doing business, added Jakanani.\n\n",
