It is widely considered a critical juncture for Zimbabwes reform agenda.\n\nWhile the Staff Monitored Programme (SMP) does not provide funding, its successful implementation is a prerequisite for future access to concessional financing, potential debt restructuring, and the restoration of confidence among international creditors and investorsall of which Zimbabwe desperately needs.The southern African nation is burdened with a burgeoning public debt that has now exceeded US$21 billion, including more than US$12.3 billion owed to external creditors.Following the visit, IMF Mission Chief Maliszewski said the IMF would like to see a fully functioning local ZiG currency and fiscal discipline with a balance between expenditure and revenue.He also addressed the issue of corruption and stressed the need for a genuine currency exchange market, as well as a credible debt restructuring process.In an attempt to put a positive spin on this, Mangwana posted on his X account his own interpretation of the IMFs comments.The IMF sees macroeconomic stability in Zimbabwe we see it too. They want to see the ZIG becoming fully our national currency  we want that too. They see the ZIG stability we are witnesses.However, Mahere, who is also a constitutional lawyer, strongly disagreed with Mangwanas sentiments.Did you listen carefully to what the IMF representative is actually saying? These are the key takeaways: This Govt has no fiscal discipline. Fiscal discipline is urgently required. The public financial management system is worrisome. Read theres too much corruption.The people need reassurance that the so-called reforms introduced will stay. Read theres no trust or public confidence in what the Govt says about the state of the economy.The ZIG is not yet a national currency. While it may look stable, it is not widely used. The official exchange rate is artificial as demonstrated by the existence of a parallel market rate. The fact that the two dont converge is problematic. You can rig an election but you cannot rig the economy, Mahere wrote on her X account in response to Mangwana.Fourteen months after its introduction, the ZiG currency is still failing to facilitate payments for essential services such as passport issuance, fuel, and other necessities, indicating its shortcomings.The private sector, particularly Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), does not accept ZiG as a form of payment in its daily transactions, leaving many, especially civil servants, searching for US dollars on the parallel market, where the exchange rate is US$1: 40 ZiG, even though the Treasury has set the official exchange rate at US$1: 27 ZiG.\n\nWhile the Staff Monitored Programme (SMP) does not provide funding, its successful implementation is a prerequisite for future access to concessional financing, potential debt restructuring, and the restoration of confidence among international creditors and investorsall of which Zimbabwe desperately needs.\n\nThe southern African nation is burdened with a burgeoning public debt that has now exceeded US$21 billion, including more than US$12.3 billion owed to external creditors.\n\nFollowing the visit, IMF Mission Chief Maliszewski said the IMF would like to see a fully functioning local ZiG currency and fiscal discipline with a balance between expenditure and revenue.\n\nHe also addressed the issue of corruption and stressed the need for a genuine currency exchange market, as well as a credible debt restructuring process.\n\nIn an attempt to put a positive spin on this, Mangwana posted on his X account his own interpretation of the IMFs comments.\n\nThe IMF sees macroeconomic stability in Zimbabwe we see it too.

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/mps-call-for-pit-bull-terrier-ban-in-zimbabwe-say-dog-breed-has-become-dangerous-to-citizens/",
            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nDISTURBED by the deadly Pit Bull Terrier dogs vicious and fatal attack of a Harare resident recently, legislators want the breed banned in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Pit Bull Terrier, commonly known as Pitbull, is an aggressive type of canine.\n\nMembers of Parliament (MPs) suggested to the Speaker Jacob Mudenda during a Question and Answer session this Wednesday that the dog breed known as Pitbull had become a threat to peoples lives as it is not wired to obey instructions like some of the breeds, hence, it should be banned in the country.\n\nThe call comes barely a fortnight after a man was mauled to death by the terrifying dogs in Bluff Hill, Harare.\n\nZanu PF Goromonzi West MP Biata Beatrice Karimatsenga- Nyamupinga raised concern over the pets-turned-killers.\n\nWhen moving in the bush we fear being killed by wild animals but when we are moving in the residential areas there are dogs such as the Pitbull.\n\nThe Pitbull is killing people. That dog does not listen to instructions from the owner. What is the government policy on the keeping of animals, in particular dogs like the Pitbull?\n\nResponding to the question, Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi, who is also Leader of Government Business in Parliament, said the law, through councils, clearly stated that a dog owner should have a licence.\n\nThat law clearly states the number of dogs which are allowed in each and every household in towns. In other areas there are no dogs which are allowed.\n\nThat is why the individual who kept a Pitbull which killed someone was arrested. The police apprehended him because it was against the law. The Pitbull needs a licence which is different from other types of dogs because it is a very vicious dog, Ziyambi said.\n\nIn her supplementary question, Karimatsenga-Nyamupinga, however, disputed that the licence itself was not enough to stop such deadly attacks seen in the past week.\n\nShe highlighted that the Pitbull loses its memory, hence needs to be outlawed.\n\nYes, the licence can be there but we have that type of dog which loses its memory. What are we trying to say if we are allowing people to keep dogs which lose their memory? What are we trying to say about the lives of people? the MP stated.\n\nZiyambi told Mudenda that her question could only be responded to by the Veterinary Department, adding she should put the question in writing for further investigation from experts.\n\nThe government policy clearly indicates that for someone to keep dogs, they must be given a licence. If we want to go deeper on the types of licence and groups, it really needs to be written down so that we can go and consult the experts.\n\nIt will be easier for each and every individual in this august House and the rest of the country to understand the requirements needed to keep Pitbull dogs, Ziyambi explained.\n\nMudenda ordered the MP to put her question in writing, as it needed further clarification.\n\nChinhoyi MP Leslie Mhangwa added his weight to the conversation.\n\nlf we have somebody who has become a danger to the community, he is put in jail or put somewhere else.\n\nThe Pitbull as a breed has become a danger to the people of Zimbabwe. Is there anything that stops us from banning the breed within the country? I think this is the direction we need to move with.\n\nThe Speaker made a ruling that the question by Karimatsenga-Nyamupinga be put in writing and be dealt with next week.\n\nA Harare man, Samuel Machara was recently killed by Pitbulls owned by Mike Mupinga (40) of Bluff Hill in Harare, who was arrested and charged with culpable homicide.\n\nIn 2022, a Bulawayo man from Selborne suburb was also bitten to death by his own canines.\n\nTwelve countries in Europe, as well as Australia, Canada, some parts of the United States, Ecuador, Malaysia, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, and Venezuela, have enacted some form of breed-specific legislation on Pitbull-type dogs, including American Pit Bull Terriers, ranging from outright bans to restrictions and conditions on ownership.\n\nSeveral states in Australia place restrictions on the breed, including mandatory sterilisation. Pitbulls are banned in the United Kingdom, in the Canadian province of Ontario, and in many locations in the United States.\n\n",

            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nIn Filabusi, the streets are packed with BMW X5s and Land Rover Defenders, modern houses paid for in cash are springing up and whisky is only sold by the bottle in the small towns bars.\n\nThe three-year surge in gold prices, driven to a record this year as US President Donald Trumps trade war bolstered its allure as a safe-haven, is enriching the countrys more than 700,000 informal, or artisanal, miners. They are flocking to gold mining belts and throwing a lifeline to an economy thats been in economic turmoil since the turn of the century.\n\nIn the first five months of this year, those miners almost doubled the metal they delivered to a state refinery from a year earlier to more than 11 tons, swelling the countrys export income. At the current pace of production the country could earn a billion dollars more from gold shipments this year than in 2024.\n\nThe prices have been very favourable to the miners which is something we are so happy about, said Wellington Takavarasha, the president of Zimbabwe Artisanal and Small Scale for Sustainable Mining Council. This year is looking very good. We must capitalize on this rally.\n\nFor the about 4% of people living in Zimbabwe, and their dependents, who are involved in the gold mining its been a vital source of income. Formal employment has withered and millions of citizens have emigrated to South Africa, the UK and other countries in search of economic opportunities. For now, its their only hope and one that depends on the high prices holding.\n\nSo far, theres no sign that the rally will come to an end. The price of the metal has surged 22% since Trumps inauguration and is up by three-fifths since the beginning of last year. It hit a record of $3,432 an ounce on May 6 and Goldman Sachs forecast it will reach $3,700 by year end.\n\nThats pushed Zimbabwes central bank to paying cash for gold deliveries, targeting a record 40 tonnes of purchases this year after it earned $2.5 billion in 2024, a 37% jump from the year earlier. Artisanal producers supplied three-quarters of the metal delivered in April, whereas a few years ago the majority of their output would have been smuggled out of the country.\n\nBrighton Moyo with a newly acquired BMWbought from gold proceedsat a car wash in Filabusi (Zinyange Auntony)\n\nFor artisanal workers like Mxolisi Dube, clad in navy blue work overalls with a miners torch strapped to his head as he walks through Filabusi, the gold price rally has been a boon. The 33-year-old began mining for gold illegally in 2008.\n\nBut now with higher prices and the cooperation of mine owners, who have begun to invite artisanal workers onto their properties to boost production, his earnings have surged.\n\nYou are assured of getting something at the end of the month, said Dube, who has a copper dental filling and a brass chain around his neck. You are protected. If you are not under a company you always have to run away.\n\nMine owners, struggling with dilapidated equipment and a lack of finance, are increasingly urging those operators to swap the pans they used to sift through river sand for gold flecks for picks and shovels to help them extract as much gold ore to process as quickly as possible.\n\nThis means we always have ore available and are milling more, said Meli Nkulumo, plant manager at Macoomber 7 mine, which lies 12 miles west of Filabusi down winding dirt roads. Artisanal miners were invited onto the property two years ago.\n\nMeli Nkulumo, a metallurgist checks a website displaying gold prices at the Macoomber 7 mine (Zinyange Auntony)\n\nAt the mine, workers use Elon Musks Starlink internet service to compare the prices offered by the central bank to global benchmarks. Goldprice.org is their favored website.\n\nHigher gold prices are better for everyone, said Thulani Ndlovu, the acting mine manager. We can also look forward to a raise in salaries.\n\nStill, its backbreaking work thats carried out around the clock. The miners break up rocks underground with picks, shovel it into a loader which is then winched to the surface. During their eight-hour shifts their only sustenance is maheu, a drink made from fermented corn meal.\n\nBut for artisanal miners the price surge has been life-changing and nowhere is that more evident than in Bekezela, a suburb of Filabusi where property owners are busy putting up brick houses ringed by electric fences and equipped with water storage tanks and solar panels. The town council is having to rezone more land for residential and commercial use and at car washes 4x4s queue to have the dust of the surrounding savannah rinsed off.\n\nBar manager Thabo Mpofu says the gold boom has attracted big spenders and he now sells whisky by the bottle. (Zinyange Auntony)\n\nDrinking holes are busy with all sorts of people spending big, Thabo Mpofu, the manager of Next Generation bar, said, adding that he has seen clients buy bottles of Hennessey Cognac and pour them out on the ground as a show of wealth.\n\nIts also curbed crime including invasions of local mines by illegal operators. Theres nothing bad here that happens, said Melusi Nyoni, the manager of Fred and Fernando mines, which are on the outskirts of Filabusi town, He now allows artisanal miners to work in shafts as deep as a kilometer (0.6 miles). There is gold just all over, he said.\n\nMine manager Melusi Nyoni after visiting the underground tunnels (Zinyange Auntony)\n\nStill, with rudimentary equipment and limited safety protocols, digging up the ore is dangerous work.\n\nGold miners at work in an underground tunnel at the Fred & Fernando mines.Photographer: Zinyange Auntony/Bloomberg\n\nInformal miners accounted for 87% of the 186 deaths in Zimbabwean mining accidents, the Chamber of Mines said in its last annual report. As recently as late May, four died at a mine near Chegutu in northern Zimbabwe when a wall of earth collapsed onto them, according to local media reports.\n\nBut as long as the rally lasts, thats little deterrence for artisanal miners who, until recently, were eking out a livingby camping out and panning for gold in remote wild areas for several months.\n\nThe high prices mean in the near future I will also be seen in a car, says Dube, a father of four. I want a Toyota Hilux 44, with a 2.7-litre engine.\n\n",

We stress that the ban should be implemented immediately to prevent further depletion of our natural capital due to unchecked lithium exploitation, which has devastating socio-economic and environmental implications, CNRG stated.\n\nThe organisation further urged the government to address the issue of porous borders, which have allowed some lithium to be smuggled into South Africa and Mozambique without any benefit to Zimbabwe\n\nZimbabwes lithium wealth risks being squandered, as unchecked exports, weak regulation, and opaque deals undermine its potential for industrial transformation.\n\nAlready, allegations of lithium smuggling across porous borders into South Africa and Mozambique raise concerns regarding corruption and illicit mineral and financial flows.\n\nUnverified reports indicate that up to 3,000 tons of lithium ore leave the country dailya staggering total of 1.62 million tons over the past 18 monthswith minimal accountability, little benefit to the state, and no protection for affected communities.\n\nDuring a post-cabinet media briefing in Harare yesterday, Mines Minister Winston Chitando said the government will ban the exportation of lithium ore as part of an effort to promote value addition and ensure that the country comprehensively benefits from its natural resources.\n\nCabinet reaffirmed the ban on the export of chrome ores and stressed the need to develop the ferrochrome industry locally. The Ministry of Mines and Mining Development will strengthen the implementation of the use it or lose it principle, and holders of all unutilised mining titles, particularly chrome, are requested to take note of the Governments position, Chitando said.\n\nHe added that Bikita Minerals and Arcadia Lithium are in the process of establishing lithium sulphate value addition facilities to beneficiate locally produced lithium ores. From January 2027 onwards, the export of lithium concentrate will no longer be permitted.\n\nLithium plays a crucial role in the clean energy transition due to its essential function in energy storage. It is a key component in lithium-ion batteries, which power electric vehicles (EVs) and facilitate large-scale energy storage systems for renewable energy sources.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Artisanal Miners Association (ZAMA) has tabled a formalisation program targeting all the artisanal players as part of efforts to maximise profits while easing the burden of work-related injuries and fatalities.\n\nArtisanal mining in Zimbabwe is largely blamed for accelerated environmental degradation and violation of socio-cultural systems. A 2022 Centre for Natural Resource Governance report on illicit financial flows in the artisanal mining sector estimated that as much as $1.9 billion is lost annually due to leakages.\n\nOn their part, artisanal miners have since cried foul over ill treatment, stigma and underpayments for the minerals by gold buyers in the shadowy economy.\n\nSpeaking to NewZimbabwe.com on Wednesday, ZAMA national coordinator, Elias Masuku, said the formalisation program will solve all the problems around artisanal mining once and for all.\n\nWe are currently rolling out a formalisation exercise which is driven by the motive of regularising every mining workspace across Zimbabwe. We are also pushing for the availability of workspaces through negotiations with people who have idle claims for them to cede. Such initiatives will go a long way to create opportunities for those willing to venture into mining, he said.\n\nMasuku said the association is offering legal services to support small-scale miners who often face the risk of harassment from the sectors big players who enjoy a firmer financial muscle. This, he said, is over and above other benefits like housing schemes, which will soon be tabled.\n\nWe have since begun work in places like Mberengwa. We are going to have a project in Buluwewe and other places as we drive the agenda of formalising, capitalising and capacitating the artisanal miner. Formalisation will benefit the miners and all the stakeholders in the value chain and is now long overdue, added Masuku.\n\n",
