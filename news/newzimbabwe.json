Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan Clementine Nkweta-Salami.\n\nEl-Fasher is under the control of the military, which has fought the RSF since Sudan descended into civil war two years ago, killing more than than 24,000 people, according to the United Nations, though activists say the number is likely far higher.\n\nThe camps were attacked again on Saturday, Nkweta-Salami said in a statement. She said that nine aid workers were killed while operating one of the very few remaining health posts still operational in Zamzam camp.\n\nThis represents yet another deadly and unacceptable escalation in a series of brutal attacks on displaced people and aid workers in Sudan since the onset of this conflict nearly two years ago, she said.\n\nNkweta-Salami didnt identify the aid workers but Sudans Doctors Union said in a statement that six medical workers with the Relief International were killed when their hospital in Zamzam came under attack on Friday.\n\nThey include Dr. Mahmoud Babaker Idris, a physician at the hospital, and Adam Babaker Abdallah, head of the group in the region, the union said.It blamed the RSF for this criminal and barbaric act.\n\nThe offensive forced about 2,400 people to flee the camps and el-Fasher, according to the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees, a local group in Darfur.\n\nZamzam and Abu Shouk shelter more than 700,000 people who have been forced to flee their homes across Darfur during past bouts of fighting in the region, Nkweta-Salami said.\n\nLate last month, the Sudanese military regained control over Khartoum, a major symbolic victory in the war. But the RSF still controls most of Darfur and some other areas.\n\nThe two camps are among five areas in Sudan where famine was detected by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, IPC, a global hunger monitoring group.\n\nThe war has created the worlds largest humanitarian crisis, with about 25 million people  half of Sudans population  facing extreme hunger.\n\n",

This latest spread is no different: bold looks, sharp silhouettes, and that effortless cool only she can pull off.\n\nTylas feature comes hot off the heels of an impressive list of magazine covers. In just over a year, shes graced the pages of British Vogue, Elle US, Billboard, Cosmopolitan, BeatRoute, T Magazine from The New York Times, and Dazed.\n\nEach shoot has spotlighted her meteoric rise from Johannesburg girl to global It-girl, never shying away from showcasing her roots.\n\nNylon magazine is considered a cool-girl staple in the fashion and pop culture world not necessarily massive like Vogue or Elle, but highly influential among Gen Z and millennial readers.\n\nIn her interview, Tyla opens up about the whirlwind of fame and how her family is riding the wave alongside her. She shared a funny moment when a fan DMd her with a photo, not of her, but of her mum.\n\nThey ask me for pictures, too, Tyla, her mother told her. Fame, it seems, runs in the family now. But its not all glitz and red carpets.\n\nTyla is taking her artistry seriously and isnt afraid to shake things up.\n\nOne day, youre going to get that Tyla rap song, she teased, hinting that theres much more to her than catchy Amapiano hooks and glossy visuals.\n\nShes taking her time with her next album, wanting to showcase a fuller picture of who she is beyond what people expect.\n\nIm excited to show people that Im more diverse than they think. I want to take my time with my artistry and give whatever feels right for that moment.\n\nWhen asked where shed take fans to understand her music better, she didnt hesitate: the CBD in Johannesburg. Its the chaos, the culture, the sound of taxis, shouting, and local music blaring from every corner that inspired her growing up, and that energy still pulses through her dance tracks.\n\nYou can hear our music playing loud. You can hear our accents, people shouting, taxis driving crazy. I would take people there because that feels like how my dance music feels, I think, she said.\n\nOn the topic of representation, Tyla shared her dreams of seeing African music  pure and unfiltered  become just as global as pop.\n\nI would love to see an African artist even if the artist isnt born and raised on the continent make African music without pop influences, just true African music. I would love to see that be as global as pop music is one day, she said.\n\nNot watered down, not reshaped to fit a Western mould. And even if shes not the one to push it all the way, shes rooted in who she is.\n\nIm an African girl, and Im always going to be, she added.\n\n",

What we want to do is to bridge the gap between what the farmers are looking for and what the Chinese can offer as a solution, from planting right up to the cigarette production, he said.\n\nThe expo is also expected to unlock opportunities for the local tobacco industry in international markets, as well as bring new technologies, he said.\n\nChina remains a major buyer of Zimbabwes tobacco, consuming about 100 million kg of the countrys tobacco crop each year, said Matsvaire.\n\nThe Chinese ordinarily would account for a third of the total tobacco that will be purchased from this country. We are expecting a crop size of about 280 million kg of tobacco at the end of this year, he said.\n\nHe noted that China Tobacco, through its local subsidiary, Tianze Tobacco Company, has been pivotal in supporting the local tobacco industry through contract farming since the advent of Zimbabwes land reform program of the early 2000s.\n\nLu Zhaofeng, executive president of the association, said the vision of this expo is to promote international trade in the tobacco business between China and Zimbabwe.\n\nThrough this expo, we want to get suppliers of facilities, equipment, and packaging industries to come here to have a look at the local requirements, she said.\n\nTobacco, primarily cultivated by small-scale farmers, is Zimbabwes leading agricultural export and one of the countrys top foreign currency earners.\n\n",

            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nPRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwas decision to sign the Private Voluntary Organisations (PVO) Bill into law has elicited a sharp rebuke from the European Union (EU), effectively shutting the door on future good governance funding.\n\nThis latest development comes as Zimbabwe appears determined to chart its own course, regardless of international concerns about human rights and transparency.\n\nThe timing of Mnangagwas signature  just hours before the commissioning of Mbares revamped informal traders market  did not go unnoticed, drawing criticism for what some view as disregard for the concerns of civil society.\n\nJobst von Kirchmann, the EU Ambassador to Zimbabwe, delivered a blunt assessment, stating that Mnangagwas insincerity had forced the bloc to withdraw its support for the good governance framework.\n\nThe situation, according to the EU, has reached a tipping point.\n\nThe PVO Act is disappointing and ill-considered, sidelining the views of diplomats and civil society organisations, von Kirchmann stated.\n\nZimbabwe has over USD 21 billion in debt and arrears with bilateral and multilateral creditors. Several years ago, the Government of Zimbabwe initiated a commendable arrears clearance and debt resolution process to address this situation.\n\nIt is disappointing to see that Zimbabwe has not upheld its own commitments under this process, particularly regarding the expansion of civic space.\n\nThe enactment of the PVO Amendment Bill, without concluding consultations to address the concerns of civil society organisations, has further reinforced negative trends in governance.\n\nAs a consequence, the European Union has decided to discontinue its planned targeted 2025 funding in support of the governments good governance initiatives under the structured dialogue framework, he said.\n\nHe added: The EU remains engaged and ready to reconsider its position should the government demonstrate a genuine commitment to meeting the governance targets outlined in the process.\n\nThe new law grants authorities sweeping powers to monitor and control the operations of private voluntary organisations, casting a long shadow over Zimbabwes civic space and raising serious questions about the future of independent advocacy.\n\nMnangagwa signed the controversial PVO Amendment Bill into law, ushering in sweeping changes to Zimbabwes regulatory framework for civic groups and non-governmental organisations.\n\nThe law, gazetted last Friday as Act No. 1 of 2025, amends five major pieces of legislation, including the PVO Act [Chapter 17:05], the Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Act, and the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act. It is now officially enforceable.\n\nAccording to the gazetted text, the new Act gives authorities extensive powers to monitor and control the operations of PVOs, including the ability to scrutinise their ownership structures, funding sources, and affiliations.\n\nIt introduces strict definitions of beneficial owner and controller, potentially holding individuals criminally liable  including with imprisonment terms of up to 35 years  for offences related to illicit financing or misrepresentation.\n\nThe law also empowers the government to deregister organisations, seize assets, or dissolve entities found to be in breach of the new provisions, a move described by critics as a chilling effect on freedom of association.\n\nThe Act establishes a PVOs Board, comprised of representatives from civil society and multiple ministries, to oversee regulation of the sector.\n\nThis board, while ostensibly designed to provide oversight, is viewed by some quarters as a tool for entrench government control.\n\nAgainst intense criticism, even from the United Nations, government officials have defended the amendments as necessary to prevent the financing of terrorism and money laundering.\n\nHuman rights groups, however, argue that the legislation opens the door to the systematic suppression of dissent, potentially stifling organisations that challenge State policies or expose official corruption.\n\n",

            "content": "UNCERTAINTY hangs over traders at the new Mbare Musika Market Hub, as responsible government officials remain evasive on the fees users will be expected to pay for stalls at the newly constructed facility.\n\nThe lack of transparency has fuelled anxieties among stakeholders amid rumour that traders would be expected to pay extortionate rentals.\n\nAlso, concerns are mounting over the allocation of trading spaces, with allegations emerging that Zanu PF is favouring its own members, potentially sidelining the very traders, who suffered losses in the devastating fire that ravaged the old market last October.\n\nThe suggestion of preferential treatment has sparked outrage and accusations of political opportunism.\n\nSpeaking at the official opening of the new market in Mbare Friday, President Emmerson Mnangagwa called on the Local Government minister to exercise fairness when setting rental rates for the traders.\n\nHis plea for moderation hinted at underlying tensions and a need to address the growing unease among those most affected.\n\nMnangagwa formally opened the first phase of the Mbare Musika Traders Market project, a development that promises to accommodate up to 1,700 traders.\n\nWe have built this facility to provide you with a conducive environment in which to conduct your businesses. The Minister of Local Government must not exploit traders, Mnangagwa stated emphatically.\n\nHe added, It is incumbent upon you, the traders, to act responsibly as you conduct your businesses within this facility.\n\nDespite the Presidents directive, Garwe remained cagey, dismissing social media reports of exorbitant rental fees but offering no concrete details.\n\nDo not give credence to the lies propagated on social media. Rentals will be very affordable. This facility is for you, a statement met with cheers tinged with scepticism.\n\nGarwe also announced that Masimba Holdings, the company awarded the US$200,000 contract to construct the new trading site, would be granted further contracts for phases two and three of the project, bypassing standard competitive tendering processes under the guise of an ongoing emergency.\n\nThis decision has raised eyebrows, with critics questioning the probity of awarding further lucrative contracts without due process.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, Women Affairs and Small and Medium Enterprise Minister Monica Mutsvangwa openly acknowledged the governments primary motive behind the market development: to increase revenue collection through rental income.\n\nThis will enable us to collect more taxes from people. The Minister of Finance, Professor Mthuli Ncube, is in agreement. We are appealing to local authorities to continue making land available for the construction of trading markets, so that we can bolster our economy, Mutsvangwa stated bluntly.\n\nWhen pressed for specifics regarding rental charges, Mutsvangwa echoed Garwes evasiveness.\n\nThe City of Harare, Masimba Holdings, and the Local Government Ministry will convene to determine the rates for traders. We do not want to burden our people with excessive fees. You heard what the President said, she offered, deflecting the responsibility onto a future, unspecified meeting.\n\nThe newly constructed Mbare Musika Market Hub\n\nIn contrast to the ministers ambiguous pronouncements, Harare Mayor Jacob Mafume revealed to Newzimbabwe.com that traders would be expected to shell out US$30 per week for access to the facility.\n\nEach trader will pay US$30 per week. This is the agreement reached with our partners: the government and Masimba Holdings. We believe that US$30 per week represents a fair price, he said, albeit providing the clarity conspicuously absent from the governments messaging.\n\nThe new traders market was constructed through a partnership involving the Government of Zimbabwe, the City of Harare, and Masimba Holdings, acting as a technical partner.\n\nThe project was initiated in response to the devastating fire that swept through the market on the night of 8 October 2024, destroying traders goods valued at an estimated US$20 million and affecting more than 4,000 individuals.\n\nIn what many perceived as a callous remark then, Garwe suggested that the disaster, which left countless traders destitute, was something of a silver lining, presenting the government with an opportunity to build a facility designed for efficient revenue collection.\n\n",
