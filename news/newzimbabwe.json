            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has urged members of the public to report any suspected bogus traffic roadblocks, warning that rogue officers found conducting such operations will face disciplinary action.\n\nThis follows growing public concern over the increasing number of police roadblocks, particularly in cities such as Harare, where some motorists have complained about encountering several checkpoints within short distances in some cases less than 10 kilometres apart.\n\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, national police spokesperson, Commissioner Paul Nyathi called on the public to alert authorities if they come across suspicious roadblocks.\n\nIn this regard, members of the public are encouraged to engage the Commissioner General of Police or the respective Provincial Command if there are concerns about unusual roadblock deployments in certain areas. Disciplinary action will be taken against any police officer who conducts roadblock duties in a manner which is not in conformity with police set standards, said Nyathi.\n\nHe emphasised that official police roadblocks are not conducted randomly, explaining that, under traffic regulations, they are typically located within a 30 to 50-kilometre radius and are subject to close supervision to prevent misconduct and corruption.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police Command reiterates that all police roadblock schedules are submitted by Station, District and Provincial Police Commanders to the Police General Headquarters Operations Department for guidance and clearance.\n\nThe policy of the Zimbabwe Republic Police is that no roadblocks are manned within a 30 to 50 kilometre radius of each policing area, whether in urban or rural set up. The police officers conducting roadblock duties are supervised by Station, District and Provincial Commanders to prevent cases of indiscipline or corruption and ensure quality service to the public, he said.\n\nCommissioner Nyathi further explained that exceptions to these guidelines may occur when the police respond to national events or urgent security situations.\n\nHowever, the public should take note that police roadblocks are heightened or increased during public order situations, national events, or special operations such as reacting to an immediate incident or scene involving moving criminals or stolen property. Soon after, the situation has to revert back to the ideal scenario.\n\nThe ZRP has faced growing criticism in recent years over reports of police officers accepting bribes from motorists, particularly commuter operators in major cities such as Harare and Bulawayo. Several officers have been caught on camera allegedly taking money from public transport drivers and other motorists, further fuelling public mistrust.\n\n",

This is clearly unacceptable and untenable, the application states.The couple is jointly charged with fraud and corruptly using a false document after allegedly altering company directorship details of Valley Lodge (Pvt) Ltd in 2017. The State alleges they removed Ayoob Omar and Mohammed Hussein Omar as directors and replaced them with their own names to take control of the lodges accounts.But the applicants say the State failed to prove any misrepresentation, intent, or prejudice.There is no way the accused persons can be placed onto the defence in circumstances where the essential elements of the offence of fraud have not been set out, they said.As it stands, the charge of fraud is barren as it lacks the essential averments required to make it a valid one.They also accused the magistrate of overstepping his judicial role.This Honourable Court has no discretion to usurp the States responsibilities as the dominus litis and proceed to recreate new particulars and averments for the alleged charge of fraud, the couple argued.It must avoid the temptation of making a bidding for the State. It laid its bed, it must lie on it.The couple further claims the States witnesses exonerated them by confirming that Valley Lodges directorship had not changed since 2009, contradicting the fraud allegations.There was a clear concession by all the critical witnesses that the directors of Valley Lodge (Pvt) Ltd have remained the same as from 2009 till today, they submitted. This concession clearly exonerated the accused persons.They also argue the State failed to prove that they withdrew any funds from the lodges bank account, allegedly amounting to US$70,000.The State never led any evidence showing that there was any withdrawal from the account in question, the defence stated. There were no withdrawal slips nor any documentary evidence to that effect.Makoni and Ndonda further challenge the authenticity of the alleged fraudulent CR14 form, saying it was never proven to have been authored or signed by them.None of the witnesses said they saw any of the accused creating or signing the alleged CR14 in issue. The State failed to prove as a matter of fact that the accused authored the document, they said.They dismissed the case as baseless.A criminal trial is not a fishing expedition. The accused persons should not be put to their defence hoping that along the way they will convict themselves out of their own mouths. This is a classical failed fishing expedition where the State has failed to even catch a small frog or a kapenta.The couple wants the High Court to review and set aside Mambanjes ruling and substitute it with a verdict of not guilty, arguing that the magistrates decision was rendered without jurisdiction and cannot stand.The matter is yet to be heard.\n\nIn their court papers, the couple accuses the magistrate of grossly misdirecting himself and creating new charges by placing them on their defence despite what they say is a State case barren of evidence.\n\nThey cite Mambanje and Prosecutor General Loice Matanda-Moyo as first and second respondents respectively.The first respondent grossly misdirected himself by ignoring that neither the main nor the alternative charge disclosed a valid offence, the application reads.The courts reasoning was so outrageous in its defiance of logic that no sensible court applying its mind could have arrived at it.The Makonis, represented by Admire Rubaya of Rubaya and Chatambudza Legal Practitioners, argue that their prosecution is a failed fishing expedition.The State is acting like a soccer player who has dived at the centre circle of a soccer pitch and clamouring to the referee to be awarded a penalty.
