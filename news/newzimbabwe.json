            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZIMBABWES second largest city, Bulawayo, is facing a distressing situation due to a severe water crisis, which has prompted the mayor to call for divine intervention.\n\nBulawayo Mayor, David Coltart says the city is grappling with an acute water shortage exacerbated by low dam levels, power outages, and insufficient government funding for infrastructure upgrades.Posting on social media, Coltart said the citys dams are at a critically low capacity, holding just over 24%, with most of the remaining water located in Insiza and Mtshabezi dams, with the situation set to worsen, as the Lower Ncema dam is set to be decommissioned.Our dams are collectively holding just over 24% of their capacity with most water remaining in Insiza & Mtshabezi dams.Lower Ncema will be decommissioned soon which will seriously affect our ability to balance the supply of water to the Ncema water treatment works & pumping station.Umzingwane dam (pictured below) and Upper Ncema have already been decommissioned, said ColtartAdding to the crisis, Coltart said the long hours of electricity (ZESA) outages have also reduced water delivery capabilities.Our ability to supply water to the city is being seriously undermined by lengthy power outages. For example, recently Mtshabezi pump station went without power for 8 consecutive days, dramatically reducing the amount of water we have been able to deliver to the city.The reservoir at Criterion (which enables a smooth supply of water), as a result of low dam levels and the power outages, is exceptionally low and water is now being pumped directly into the water purification works.Normally the reservoir is kept almost full so that there is a smooth and continuous supply of water through the purification works, said Coltart.Meanwhile, Coltart said the government is yet to avail financial assistance to upgrade the Insiza dam.Most of the finances promised by the government to upgrade both the Insiza & Mtshabezi pipelines (to increase the supply of water from those dams) have not been provided yet and so this work has not started.Although we did have some rain in our catchment areas in November, because of the dryness of the land and rampant gold panning in our catchment areas, there have been insignificant inflows to all our dams since the onset of the rainy season.Compounding this situation is the above average temperatures experienced in December which has led to increased evaporation. As a result our dam levels have continued to drop, said ColtartIn a heartfelt plea, the mayor prayed for divine intervention, calling on the Lord Almighty to cause rain to fall and fill our dams, pointing out the danger while also pleading for calmness from the residents of Bulawayo.The consequence of all of the above is that it has been exceptionally difficult for our engineers to deliver sufficient water to residents and as a result across the city the majority of residents are experiencing increasingly lengthy periods without water supplies.The situation is deeply regretted but is largely beyond our control. The Bulawayo City Council is doing all in its power to alleviate the situation. We ask for residents understanding.At this time of grave crisis, I call on the Lord Almighty to cause rain to fall and fill our dams, said Coltart.\n\nBulawayo Mayor, David Coltart says the city is grappling with an acute water shortage exacerbated by low dam levels, power outages, and insufficient government funding for infrastructure upgrades.\n\nPosting on social media, Coltart said the citys dams are at a critically low capacity, holding just over 24%, with most of the remaining water located in Insiza and Mtshabezi dams, with the situation set to worsen, as the Lower Ncema dam is set to be decommissioned.Our dams are collectively holding just over 24% of their capacity with most water remaining in Insiza & Mtshabezi dams.Lower Ncema will be decommissioned soon which will seriously affect our ability to balance the supply of water to the Ncema water treatment works & pumping station.Umzingwane dam (pictured below) and Upper Ncema have already been decommissioned, said ColtartAdding to the crisis, Coltart said the long hours of electricity (ZESA) outages have also reduced water delivery capabilities.Our ability to supply water to the city is being seriously undermined by lengthy power outages.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFOOTBALL administrator, Philemon Machana has written to the Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) Electoral Committee challenging allegations made against him by one K. Mugadzaweta at a time candidates are campaigning for the associations presidency.\n\nMugadzweta recently wrote a letter to the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC), which was also copied to the ZIFA Electoral Committee, accusing Machana of financial misconduct.\n\nMugadzweta is requesting that Machana be disqualified and investigated for misappropriating over US$700,000 in funds.\n\nZIFA is expected to conduct the elections on January 25 next year.\n\nMachana, represented by his lawyer Admire Rubaya, has informed the ZIFA Ethics Committee that these allegations are unfounded and part of a smear campaign orchestrated by his opponents to intimidate him.\n\nIn a letter dated December 18, 2024, Machana stated that the complaint seeks to vilify him for his involvement in the prior ZIFA administration, despite other board members remaining unscathed.\n\nThis dubious report to ZACC and the Ethics Committee is part of a wider smear campaign which attempts to sabotage our clients candidacy through underhanded tactics and manufactured accusations.\n\nThese unfounded allegations are a desperate ploy to discredit him and undermine his chances of success. We implore and urge the committee to dismiss these baseless claims with the contempt they deserve, Rubaya said on behalf of Machana.\n\nMugadzweta claimed that an audit found ZIFA transferred $740,270 from a $749,996 FIFA grant into an account associated with Conduit Investments, a firm where Machana serves as both a shareholder and director, in violation of FIFA and ZIFA regulations.\n\nMachanas legal team has dismissed these allegations as malicious attempts aimed at undermining his candidacy and damaging his reputation.\n\nWe hasten to posit that the timing of this alleged complaint is highly suspicious, Machanas letter asserted.\n\nThe $740,270 referred to was moved to Conduit under a ZIFA resolution to avert a potential risk while a new ZIFA account was being opened. This was communicated with FIFA and was done in good faith.\n\nThe transferred money was moved back to ZIFA immediately after a new ZIFA account had been opened, and no transactions were effected before the funds were returned.\n\nThis matter was duly prosecuted after it was reported to ZACC by SRC, and all the accused persons were acquitted by the Harare Regional Court.\n\nWhat is interesting is that our client was criminally charged together with Mr. Farai Jere, another presidential candidate, who equally stands acquitted.\n\nThe complainants sponsors are only after our client for the obvious reasons that they are afraid of his popularity; thus they want him removed by hook or crook, rhe lawyer wrote.\n\nMugadzweta also alleged that Machanas company was receiving irregular payments, citing that Conduit Investments received $25,600 disguised as a loan repayment.\n\nMachana contended that all his dealings were above board and that his opponents are seeking to punish him for his contributions to the betterment of the game.\n\nIt is shockingly outrageous that our client is being subjected to abuse and harassment for his benevolence relating to his willingness to help ZIFA when it was in dire financial straits which caused a crisis. His company incurred losses by providing substantial loans at zero interest, Rubaya stated.\n\nMachana further dismissed allegations that he failed to disclose his interest in Conduit during all transactions involving ZIFA.\n\nRubaya said his client has always declared his role as CEO, founder, and shareholder of Conduit Investments.\n\nNo one at ZIFA has ever claimed ignorance of this fact; FIFA, the SRC, and the general public were all aware of his association.\n\nRubaya said the football team linked to his client proudly carries the name Conduit.\n\nHe said this makes it impossible for anyone to claim they were unaware of his connection.\n\n",

            "content": "AP\n\nGisle Pelicot spoke of her very difficult ordeal after 51 men were convicted Thursday in the drugging-and-rape trial that riveted France andturned her into an icon, expressing support for other victims whose cases dont get such attention and whose stories remain untold.\n\nI want you to know that we share the same fight, she said in her first words after the court in the southern French city of Avignon handed down prison sentences ranging from three to 20 years inthe shocking casethat spurreda national reckoning about the blight of rape culture.\n\nGisele Pelicot arrives at the court house in Avignon for the verdicts. (AP Photo/Lewis Joly)\n\nPelicots ex-husband,Dominique Pelicot, and all but one of his co-defendants were convicted of sexually assaulting her over a period of nearly a decade after hed knocked her unconscious by lacing her food and drink with drugs. The other co-defendant was convicted of drugging and raping his own wife with Dominique Pelicots help.\n\nAs campaigners against sexual violence protested outside the courthouse, the 72-year-old Gisle Pelicot expressed my profound gratitude towards the people who supported me.\n\nYour messages moved me deeply, and they gave me the strength to come back, every day, and survive through these long daily hearings, she said. This trial was a very difficult ordeal.\n\nPelicot a hero to many in Franceand beyond for courageously demanding that all the evidence be heard in open court  also said she was thinking of her grandchildren after enduring the more than three-month trial, where she sat in the same courtroom as her attackers.\n\nIts also for them that I led this fight, she said of her grandkids. I wanted all of society to be a witness to the debates that took place here. I never regretted making this decision. I have trust in our capacity to collectively project ourselves toward a future where all, women and men, can live in harmony, with respect and mutual understanding. Thank you.\n\nThe court found Dominique Pelicot guilty on all charges and sentenced him to 20 years in prison, which was the maximum possible. At age 72, he could spend the rest of his life behind bars. He wont be eligible to request early release until hes served at least two-thirds of the sentence.\n\nDominique Pelicot and the other defendants stood up, one after the other, as chief judge Roger Arata read out the verdicts and sentences, which took more than an hour.\n\nGisle Pelicot sometimes nodded her head as verdicts were announced.\n\nDominique Pelicots lawyer, Batrice Zavarro, said she would consider an appeal, but she also expressed hope that Gisle Pelicot would find solace in the rulings.\n\nI wanted Mrs. Pelicot to be able to emerge from these hearings in peace, and I think that the verdicts will contribute to this relief for Mrs. Pelicot, she said.\n\nOf the 50 accused of rape, just one was acquitted but was instead convicted of aggravated sexual assault. Another man was also found guilty of the sexual assault charge he was tried for  producing 51 guilty verdicts in all.\n\nIn a side room where defendants family members watched the proceedings on television screens, some burst into tears and gasped as sentences were revealed.\n\nProtesters outside the courthouse followed the developments on their phones. Some read out the verdicts and applauded as they were announced inside. But disquiet grew as many of the sentences were lower than campaigners had hoped for, and cries of shame on the justice system! rose up from the crowd.\n\nIn addition tothe 20 years they sought for Dominique Pelicot, prosecutors asked for sentences of 10 to 18 years for the others charged with rape. But the court was more lenient, with many defendants getting less than a decade in prison. The five judges voted by secret ballot, by majority for the convictions and sentences.\n\nFor the defendants other than Dominique Pelicot, sentences ranged from three to 15 years imprisonment, with some of the time suspended for some of them. Arata told six defendants they were now free, accounting for time already spent in pretrial detention.\n\nSophie Burtin, 53, who traveled from Lyon to show support for Gisle Pelicot, said the trial brought the subject of rape out into open but expressed disappointment that the sentences arent at all exemplary.\n\nSome men will think, OK, its alright, what they did wasnt really a rape, she said. The message thats sent is, Is it really serious?  with sentences that are so light. For me, It was meant to be a historic trial, but the feeling I have is that history hasnt been made.\n\nGisle Pelicots courage duringthe bruising trialand her appalling ordeal, inflicted on the retired power company worker in what she had thought was a loving marriage, galvanized campaigners and spurred calls for tougher measures to stamp out rape culture.\n\nShe waived her right to anonymity as a survivor of sexual abuse and successfully pushed for the hearings and shocking evidence  including her ex-husbands homemade videos of the rapes  to be heard in open court, insisting that shame should fall on her abusers, not her.\n\nThe hearingsfueled conversations on a national level in Franceand among families, couples and friends about how to better protect women and the role that men can play.\n\nMen are starting to talk to women  their girlfriends, mothers and friends  in ways they hadnt before, said Fanny Foures, 48, who joined other women in gluing messages of support for Gisle Pelicot on walls around Avignon before the verdict.\n\nIt was awkward at first, but now real dialogues are happening, she said.\n\nSome women are realizing, maybe for the first time, that their ex-husbands violated them, or that someone close to them committed abuse, Foures added. And men are starting to reckon with their own behavior or complicity  things theyve ignored or failed to act on. Its heavy, but its creating change.\n\nA banner that campaigners hung on a city wall opposite the courthouse read, MERCI GISELE  thank you Gisle.\n\nThe defendants  strangers Dominique Pelicot recruited online  were all accused of having taken part in hissordid rape and abuse fantasiesthat he acted out with them and filmed in the couples retirement home in the small Provence town of Mazan and elsewhere.\n\nHe first came to the attention of police in September 2020 when a supermarket security guard caught him surreptitiously filming up womens skirts.\n\nPolice subsequently found his library of images documenting years of abuse  more than 20,000 photos and videos in all, stored on computer drives and catalogued in folders marked abuse, her rapists, night alone and other titles.\n\nThe abundant evidence led police to the other defendants. In the videos, investigators counted 72 different abusers but werent able to identify them all.\n\nAlthough some of the accused  including Dominique Pelicot  acknowledged that they were guilty of rape, many didnt.\n\nSome argued that Dominique Pelicots consent covered his wife, too. Some insisted that they hadnt intended to rape anyone when they responded to the husbands invitations to come to their home. Some laid blame at his door, saying he misled them into thinking they were taking part in consensual kink.\n\n",

            "content": "Rolling Stone\n\nLiam Paynes drug usage brought him close todeath multiple times months before hisfatal fallin October, according to his friend Roger Nores.\n\nIn a 91-page filing obtained byRolling StoneThursday, Nores  who is accused of abandonment followed by death  described the alleged depth of Paynes drug abuse, which he claims led to several hospitalizations, multiple rehab center visits, and two resuscitations in just the last two years.\n\nLast week, a judge called for an indagatoria, which requires suspects in a case to be questioned as part of the investigation. Suspects are not required to respond to questioning, and can submit written responses, as Nores did Wednesday. It is not a deposition. The document  which includes Nores version of events, and screenshots of conversations with people close to the former One Direction member  was filed by Nores to support his defense to the charge of abandonment of a person, followed by death.\n\nI was a friend who loved him very much, who helped him selflessly in everything I could, who spent my own money to help him, and even then it was not enough, writes Nores in Spanish in the document obtained byRolling Stone. I do not consider that I deserve the accusation that is being leveled at me.\n\nIn the filing, Nores claims that Payne was in and out of rehabilitation centers in Europe and the United States in the months leading up to his death, that he consumed heroin, and that his usage of substances nearly killed him several times.\n\nIn one instance, in September 2023, Nores alleges that Payne suffered from a severe intoxication that left him close to death, and that he was hospitalized for three days in Milan. He claims that at the time, Payne was forced to cancel a Latin American tour because of the incident and his subsequent visit to a rehab center. (Payne had canceled the tour that August due to a bad kidney infection.)\n\nBecause of his addictions, Payne continued to attend rehab centers of his own free will in an attempt to overcome them, the statement contends. Unfortunately, these treatments were not successful and his addiction worsened as he began to use harder drugs, such as heroin.\n\nNores claims that Payne was hospitalized twice again in London in late 2023, and was taken to a hospital in an ambulance due to his high levels of intoxication, where he had to be resuscitated. Professionals had to resort to resuscitation maneuvers to save his life, without his family or friends being able to do anything to avoid these situations or help him, Nores alleges.\n\nNores claims that Paynes drug issues continued to worsen at the beginning of 2024, and that Payne entered a rehabilitation facility in Spain in March. Payne left the rehab center before completing treatment and returned to consuming drugs, Nores claims.Payne then allegedly had to be resuscitated again following a near overdose the following month.\n\nLiam suffered a new relapse in his addiction, so he was again taken to the hospital in serious condition, and the professionals had to resort to resuscitation maneuvers to save his life, Nores claims. He further alleges that after this incident, Paynes father attempted to admit him to a psychiatric treatment center, but that Payne opposed the idea.\n\nSince he was not legally required to stay there, Payne checked himself out of the hospital and returned to the United States to seek help for his drug addiction, Nores claims. The filing contends that Paynes family and friends allowed him to do drugs the day before he left for the States to avoid that he become violent. (The document does not specify the exact timeline of his return to the United States.\n\nNores maintains that Payne did not consume drugs that summer, including during a trip to Argentina when Payne went to a Louis Tomlinson show in South America. However, by the start of August, Nores claims that he and Payne had a strong argument where he discouraged Payne from returning to Manchester, England, because Nores could tell that Payne had started using drugs again.\n\nIn an Aug. 23 email obtained byRolling Stone, Nores writes to Paynes attorney and father Geoff that he is really concerned for his well-being in the United Kingdom. I hope you can bring professional doctors to check on his health regularly as soon as possible as I did while he was out in the US, Nores wrote. I am going to stay fully out of the picture and disconnected from now on and I wish you all the best with Liams health and career.\n\nReps for Paynes family in Argentina and the United Kingdom did not immediately respond toRolling Stones request for comment on Nores filing. Nores did not comment.\n\nNores abandonment followed by death charge accuses him of leaving Payne while knowing that he was unable to care for himself and/or that he wasnt in his right mind. For said charge, Nores could face five to 15 years in prison. In Wednesdays filing, Nores maintains that he was not his doctor, lawyer, or representative, and claims that when he left Payne at the hotel the day he died, he was greeting fans and seemed to be fine. (Hetold TMZthat he was playful and in good spirits.)\n\nIn the document, Nores pivots blame to the hotel staff for carrying Paynes body to his room where there was more of a risk of death. According to a 911 call, the reception head claimed the musician had been breaking everything in his room prior to the fatal fall. If Liam had not been brought into the room by force, and had been left in the lobby and a doctor had been called while they saw him convulsing, none of this would have happened, reads the filing.\n\nAlong with Nores, the other four people charged in the case responded to indagatorias. Next, the judge must determine whether the defendants should be further prosecuted, dropped from the case, or if there isnt evidentiary support for either decision.\n\nPayne died at the age of 31of multiple traumas and internal bleeding after falling from the third-floor balcony of the CasaSur Palermo hotelon Oct. 16. In November, prosecutors identifiedalcohol, cocaine, and a prescribed antidepressantin Paynes system at the time of his death, according to a toxicology report. Many questions still loom about what led to his death.\n\nOn Saturday, Paynesfans held a marchin Buenos Aires calling for significant and timely advances in the investigation. The gathering spawned after an image leaked online, which appeared to show Payne being carried by three hotel workers back to his room, allegedly mere minutes before he fell.\n\n",

The project was funded by the 18 PSL clubs.\n\nOutgoing PSL chairperson Farai Jere described the land acquisition as a historic move towards professionalising football in Zimbabwe.\n\nThis is quite historic. It signifies where we want to take our football. We cannot talk about development without addressing infrastructure development, said Jere.\n\nJere added that the complex will house PSL offices as well as the Womens League.\n\nWe will have state-of-the-art offices, a football pitch, a conference centre, and apartments. Our offices will also encompass womens football, he said.\n\nWhen Jere ascended to the chairmanship of the PSL in 2018, he vowed to acquire a piece of land for the football board and appears to have fulfilled his promise.\n\nJeres term as PSL chairperson ends on 31 December.\n\nI have been speaking with the CEO about plans to extend the project.

Time is running out. There is not enough food and we are only getting 500ml ofmageuand instant porridge in 24 hours, he said.\n\nIts tough.

The main thing thats killing people is starvation. Theres about 300 people there and only about 30 of them are in a good state.\n\nSince November, more than 1,500 illegal miners have surfaced through the different shafts in Stilfontein. This includes eight dead bodies.\n\nMany people are sick, and others are dying. The main thing thats killing people is starvation. Theres about 300 people there and only about 30 of them are in a good state.\n\nHe said some people resorted to using gold as currency for transactions, while alleged kingpins exerted control. However, he didnt know where the alleged kingpins are.\n\nI was only told theres a payment required for one to come out.\n\nThe miner recounted how he was approached at a tavern with a promise of employment and subsequently entered the mine.\n\nI got here in May. We were approached while sitting at a tavern and were promised employment at the Stilfontein mine. It was four of us and we were handed hammers, chisels and gumboots.\n\nMining Affected Communities United in Action has again filed anurgent applicationin the Pretoria high court to compel the state to provide humanitarian aid, including food, water and medication within two hours of the court order.\n\nThe organisation wants the state to cover costs of necessities, claiming about R76,000 of donations has run out.\n\nIts the state that is deliberately delaying that rescue operation. They should then be the ones who provide food, medication and all of those basic necessities.\n\n",
