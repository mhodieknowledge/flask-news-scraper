The Bank finalised a US$15 million Agrobond which was privately placed with a European Fund and will go towards supporting the agriculture sector, she said.\n\nDuring the period under review, the Group generated operating income of ZWG1.3 billion for the nine months to September 30, 2025.\n\nIn terms of the Groups core business, net interest income rose by 63% compared to the same period in 2024, driven by increased loans and advances to productive sectors and support for consumer needs. Core income streams remain resilient, supported by strong growth in loans and deposits, while management continues to prioritise revenue diversification and cost optimisation.\n\nThe Group incurred operating expenditure of ZWG1.1 billion, a 70% increase from the prior year. This variance primarily reflects the impact of strategic business reengineering initiatives undertaken during the year, including restructuring and staff rationalisation to align operations with the Groups strategic vision.\n\nTotal assets increased to ZWG9.2 billion, up 27% from ZWG7.3 billion recorded on December 31, 2024. The growth was anchored by an expansion in loans and advances, which stood at ZWG4.2 billion at the end of the quarter.\n\nThe domestic economy is projected to grow by 6.6% in 2025 in line with earlier projections in light of the sustained macroeconomic stability, record-high gold prices, growing remittances and a 12.8% rebound in agriculture following the 2024 El Nino.\n\nIn light of the above, the Group will continue to focus on supporting key sectors of the economy through its core business, Mutandwa added.\n\n",

The hosts, under recently appointed manager Romanian Marian Marinica, who replaced Michael Nees a few weeks ago, fell behind when Mohamed Gouda scored on just nine minutes.\n\nHowever, Munashe Garananga equalised midway through the first half, with Belgian Pro League club Mechelen winger Bill Antonio grabbing a winner on 74 minutes to seal a long-awaited triumph. Writing on Instagram, then looking ahead to the Africa Cup of Nations which sees Zimbabwe take on Angola, Egypt and South Africa in Group B, the competition starting on December 21, with the first game against Egypt on Saturday, December 22, Nakamba believes the victory was a huge momentum going into the tournament.\n\nHe said: A BIG THANK YOU to all Zimbabweans who were rallying behind us back from home, all over the world and those in Qatar, Saudi Arabia who came out in numbers to support us during the international friendly matches. Without you, we feel incomplete. Thank you to the ZIFA leadership, led by the Zifa president Nqobile Magwizi for organising such kind of international friendlies matches. Thank you to the Minister of Tourism, Honourable Barbara Rwodzi, who took time to visit the team in camp and to watch us play against Algeria in Saudi Arabia on Thursday, even though we disappointingly lost that match 3-1.\n\nLastly, I want to thank the corporate world and all football stakeholders, we dearly need your support in everything we do, kindly chip in, help and support us. The victory against Qatar brings confidence and renewed zeal within the squad, especially with just a few weeks left before the prestigious AFCON tournament. As players, we always play with our hearts out, I believe with your support and if we all pull in one direction, we will get it right. This is the moment we need your support the most. Thank you, Zimbabweans.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nMining activities in several communities have taken a disturbing turn, with foreign investors accused of displacing villagers, disrupting livelihoods, and failing to compensate affected families or rehabilitate damaged land, Mashonaland East Senator Chief Chikwaka has warned.\n\nSpeaking in the Senate recently, Goromonzis Chief Chikwaka said that while Zimbabwe remains open for business, some foreign miners were wreaking havoc in the communities where they operate.\n\nWhat is government policy regarding the allocation of licences where you find miners displacing local communities? This is affecting peoples livelihoods. You would find that people are just relocated without improving their livelihoods.\n\nWhat is the government policy in terms of people who are being displaced by mining activities, where you find, them being relocated to areas which are not conducive? he said.\n\nHis concerns come just two months after President Emmerson Mnangagwa directed Parliament to expedite the long-overdue Mines and Minerals Bill to address ongoing disputes between miners, farmers, and communities.\n\nResponding to the issue, Mines and Mining Development Deputy Minister responsible for Oil and Gas Research and other Strategic Minerals Exploration, Caleb Makwiranzou, acknowledged the challenges.\n\nThe Deputy Minister said, Before giving permission to miners, we require a report, which is called the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), which is a report, which looks at the community which is going to be affected, and where they are going to be relocated. If they going to receive houses where they are going to be relocated, then after getting that report, that is where we allow mining companies to go ahead.\n\nMakwiranzou also highlighted provisions in the new law.\n\nI want to inform this House that the new law [H. B. 1, 2025] allows that if someone has their field or their farm and there is a need for mining to be done in that field, that person is given the first option. The person is asked whether they allow the miners, and then they can discuss with whoever wants to mine if there is an allocation of shares. The person can then be given shares.\n\nOn the other hand, if that person is to be relocated, it should be consensual. They must give consent because the previous law was causing disputes where there was conflict between the Minerals Act and the Agricultural Act, said Makwiranzou.\n\nHowever, Chief Chikwaka argued that, in reality, no environmental impact assessments were being conducted before mining begins.\n\nThere is no Environmental Impact Assessment, which is being done. You would find that miners are just coming into the community. They start drilling in peoples fields. They start mining and excavating in peoples fields and leave such fields open.\n\nThey do not cover the pits and the original farmer cannot farm on his land because there are pits. There is a need for consultation with stakeholders, Chief Chikwaka said.\n\nMakwiranzou stressed that operating without an EIA is illegal, adding that government would send inspectors to the affected communities and block the mining activities.\n\n",

Among them is HC 2312/24  Collin Zondai Makoni vs The State, which the writer says came [before] Justice Munangati despite the fact that it was from her law firm, involving lawyers Skumbuzo Mpofu and Skyvaine Vongai Tendere. This matter is pending decision pronouncement, the letter notes.\n\nThe whistle-blower also cites Thelma Chimbanga vs L Gono Enterprises (HC 1518/24), which they say was heard by the same judge despite originating from the same law firm, and is still awaiting a set down.\n\nAnother flagged case is Blue Star Logistics vs Harare Motorways (HC 8108/24), where Thabani Mpofu is representing the Applicant, with the author adding: I believe this anomaly is being overlooked since Thabani Mpofu and Webster Chiikwanha are the best of friends.\n\nThe author insists that Justice Munangati Manongwa should not hear any matters instructed to Advocate Mpofu by Munangati and Associates legal practitioners, urging ZACC to intervene because these allegations, which are very serious in nature be investigated so as to avoid prejudice to other litigants.\n\nThe writer further notes that this is not their first complaint to ZACC: Kindly note that I once wrote to your good office again on the 24th of June 2024.\n\n",
