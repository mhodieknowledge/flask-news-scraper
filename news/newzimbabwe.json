            "content": "By BBC\n\nPOPE Leo has held an audience with Hollywood stars, urging actors and directors including Cate Blanchett, Viggo Mortensen and Monica Bellucci to continue their work as pilgrims of the imagination, helping to bring hope.\n\nThe celebrity meeting was a sprinkling of star dust for a still relatively new pope and a way for the Catholic Church to engage more with the world beyond.It was also a strong show of support from Leo XIV for the global film industry, as he spoke out against the troubling decline in cinema-going.Hailed by director Spike Lee as a great day, the gathering was the first of its kind in the Vatican.Beneath the magnificent frescoes of the Clementine Hall, Pope Leo spoke in Italian to praise the power of cinema to entertain and to educate  and for its capacity to amaze.But he urged filmmakers not to shy away from what he called the worlds wounds.Violence, poverty, exile, loneliness, addiction and forgotten wars are issues that need to be acknowledged and narrated, the Pope said.Good cinema does not exploit pain; it recognizes and explores it. This is what all the great directors have done.Six months since a conclave of cardinals elected the first North American to the Papacy, some Catholics feel that Leo has been slow to stamp his own mark on the role.His predecessor, Francis, was a charismatic Argentinian known for his off-the-cuff comments and dramatic gestures. Leos style is far quieter, so this star-studded engagement is a new look.Its not clear how the cast list was drawn up, although none of the directors in the hall  who came from all over the world  made it onto the Popes own top film list.This week, the Vatican revealed that his favourite four watches of all time included the 1960s nun-themed classic The Sound of Music, Its a Wonderful Life and Italian Roberto Benignis multi award-winning Life is Beautiful.Among those who did join todays A-list audience were Mortensen, Chris Pine and filmmaker Gus Van Sant  of Milk and Good Will Hunting fame. The large Italian contingent included Gianni Amelio and Cinema Paradiso creator, Giuseppe Tornatore.At a time of immense pressure on film, not long after a major Hollywood strike and with funding strains here in Italy, the Pope spoke in defence of the industry.He was applauded loudly when he talked of the quiet dedication of all those behind the scenes with vital roles.He also warned against the closure of cinemas which he characterised as the beating heart of communities.More than a few people are saying that the art of cinema and the cinematic experience are in danger. I urge institutions not to give up, but to cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value of this activity, the Pope said.After a fifteen-minute speech and a blessing he then received each audience member in turn, led by Blanchett.He really urged us to go back into our day jobs and inspire people, the Australian-born star told reporters.One of many who came bearing gifts, the actress  who works with the UN refugee agency, UNHCR  placed a woven bracelet in the Popes hand. It was a bracelet I wear in solidarity with people who are displaced, she explained later.Lee handed the Chicago-born Pope a New York Knicks shirt printed with the number 14 and the words Pope Leo.\n\nThe celebrity meeting was a sprinkling of star dust for a still relatively new pope and a way for the Catholic Church to engage more with the world beyond.\n\nIt was also a strong show of support from Leo XIV for the global film industry, as he spoke out against the troubling decline in cinema-going.Hailed by director Spike Lee as a great day, the gathering was the first of its kind in the Vatican.Beneath the magnificent frescoes of the Clementine Hall, Pope Leo spoke in Italian to praise the power of cinema to entertain and to educate  and for its capacity to amaze.But he urged filmmakers not to shy away from what he called the worlds wounds.Violence, poverty, exile, loneliness, addiction and forgotten wars are issues that need to be acknowledged and narrated, the Pope said.Good cinema does not exploit pain; it recognizes and explores it.

This entitlement they have to South Africa is sickening.She added that the more South African government keeps nursing Zimbabweans and making them feel like they have rights, the more they start believing they have bigger rights than South Africans.Ngobese-Zuma said the influx of undocumented Zimbabweans has created resentment among locals, describing their attitude as intrusive and entitled.Ngobese-Zuma: Zimbabwean men have become cowardsThe activist went further, calling Zimbabwean men cowards for fleeing their country instead of confronting their political leadership.The reason we have entitled people like Dube here is because the men of Zimbabwe have become cowards. They no longer want to fight for Zimbabwe, they want to fight for South Africa, she said.She urged Zimbabweans to return home and challenge President Emmerson Mnangagwas regime instead of depending on South Africa for economic refuge.Whether there is Operation Dudula or March in March, that is none of Zimbabweans business. Their job is to fix their country, she said.Ngobese-Zuma urges Zimbabweans to Go back home and fix their countryShe lamented the growing number of Zimbabweans crossing into South Africa, accusing them of using migration as a shortcut rather than addressing the root causes of their countrys crisis.Now every minute someone in Zimbabwe has a problem, the solution is to come to South Africa.

Biti and other opposition figures were scheduled to speak at the ill-fated event.Responding to the latest police deployment, Biti said he was being targeted for defending constitutionalism and speaking out against authoritarianism.The police barricade at our law firm is an unlawful and unconstitutional invasion of our right to work. We are a peaceful, law-abiding group. We have a right to freedom of movement, association and speech.We are being targeted for our consistency and principled position against autocracy and dictatorship. We are being targeted for our defence of the Constitution and our firm rejection of the 2030 Agenda.We are being targeted for our firm stance against corruption and its principal disciples, some of whom now hold presidential ambitions, Biti said.Meanwhile, Bitis lawyer Jeremiah Bamu said they had engaged police and were assured that neither Biti nor his law firm is under investigation, with officers insisting they were only carrying out routine law and order duties in the area.\n\nBiti, a staunch critic of President Emmerson Mnangagwas rule, is among opposition politicians campaigning against Zanu PFs illegal plan to extend the 83-year-old rulers term beyond 2028.\n\nHeavy police presence at Bitis law chambers on Saturday was reportedly in anticipation of a possible gathering by the Constitution Defence Forum, which Biti leads in its push against the 2030 Agenda.About three weeks ago, the Southern Africa Political Economy Series (SAPES) Trust premises were petrol-bombed and a security guard was abducted, in what is believed to be another attempt to stop discussions around the political move to perpetuate Mnangagwas incumbency.

The ZiG has depreciated by 26% against the USD year over year.\n\nHanke, a long-time critic of Zimbabwes monetary policies, also issued a scathing assessment of Mnangagwas leadership, labelling his administration as corrupt.\n\nSteve Hanke\n\nPresident Mnangagwa = arrogant, incompetent and corrupt, Hanke added.\n\nThe Johns Hopkins Professor has been measuring Zimbabwes inflation rate for over five years.\n\nThe comments come as authorities continue to defend the ZiG as a stable and structured currency backed by gold and foreign reserves.\n\nThe ZiG was introduced in April 2024 to reduce Zimbabwes dependency on the US dollar. However up to now, most businesses remain reluctant to accept the domestic currency preferring the greenback.\n\nThe ZiG replaced the Zimbabwean dollar, which was introduced in 2019 but was rendered worthless due to hyperinflation.\n\nMeanwhile, government plans to phase out the US dollar and make ZiG the sole currency by 2030.\n\n",

And she feels deep gratitude to receive this award as a representative of a young generation.This award itself will be instrumental in making sure that we have a lot more spotlight on the work that we are doing.It is a paradigm shift that also played a role in the jurys decision, explained jury chair Claus Stcker, Director Programmes for Africa at DW.Young people across the continent are campaigning for a say in decision-making, transparency, and social change, as demonstrated by the protest movements of Generation Z in countries like Kenya, Madagascar, Tanzania and Cameroon, Stcker said.For the jury, she is a prime example not only of protest, but of a new generation of democrats, courageously taking responsibility and helping to shape the future of their countries.The prize is regarded as the highest German recognition for deserving Africans.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA FRESH wave of abductions and torture is unravelling in Zimbabwe amid a pushback against President Emmerson Mnangagwas regimes attempt to extend his incumbency beyond 2028.\n\nKnown and perceived critics of Mnangagwas plot are now targeted for abduction, torture and possible disappearances. Those lucky to face the law will be charged with violating the controversial Patriotic Act, a Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) intelligence officer told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nRecently, activist Godfrey Karembera, popularly known as Madzibaba Veshanduko, was reportedly seized by unidentified men, later found in State custody, and allegedly beaten and denied medical care, according to rights groups and independent media.\n\nPolice claim he faces charges under Zimbabwes Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act and are signalling possible use of the Patriotic Act (2023)  a controversial amendment that criminalises conduct deemed to injure the sovereignty and national interest of Zimbabwe.\n\nKaremberas detention betrays a broader climate in which dissent is met with State-linked violence, opaque charges, and expansive security laws, a senior police intelligence officer told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nOnly last week, two student activists from Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) were abducted and tortured. Lindon Zanga (21) and Malvin Madanda (29), who belong to a students union aligned to the opposition, were on November 10 abducted, tortured and dumped by unknown assailants over impending students council elections.\n\nThe recent cases of abductions and torture have reignited concern over a rising pattern targeting government critics.\n\nThese cases fit a long-standing pattern of targeted abductions and intimidation of opposition figures, students, and activists, said Lemuel Mukandawire, a human rights defender.\n\nAs rights organisations, we argue that the Patriotic Acts wording is vague and enables abuse and suppresses legitimate political organising.\n\nThough parts of the 2023 law have been challenged in court, key provisions remain in force and continue to be invoked.\n\nThe legislation, Mukandawire said, is also meant to silence activism beyond Zimbabwes borders.\n\nAuthorities from the Mnangagwa establishment are reportedly closely watching organisers ofdemonstrations inother countries against the 83-year-old Zanu PF leader, whose administration is blamed economic decay that is resulting in droves leaving the country for greener pastures.\n\nThere is a long watchlist of with names of diaspora activists such as Tanyaradzwa Emily Daka, Francis Mubani, Xoliso Sithole, Mollin Muteto, Cretah Mupfudze, Dadirayi Mukwedeya, Ralph Dube, Elizabeth Chitengo, Happiness Ncube, Edgar Mancini, Eness Mapungwana, Nkululeko Ndlovu, Melody Talent Mkwenje, Prince Justin Chihurani, Josephine Mudimbu and others, who are of interest.\n\nZimbabweans in the UK are watching closely, as authorities have hinted that the same law may be applied to those accused of coordinating political activity abroad. The police source cited meetings that took place before and after the failed demonstration in Zimbabwe, further said the police source.\n\nMeetings held in South Africa, UK in Durham led by Shepherd Yuda and Patson Muzuwa, among others, have reportedly rattled President Emmerson Mnangagwas regime accused of running down the economy and gross human rights violations.\n\nRights groups continue to call for independent investigation, medical access, and protection of fundamental freedoms as fears grow that transnational repression may widen.\n\n",
