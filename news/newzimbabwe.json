            "content": "TimesLive\n\nPA leader and sport, arts and culture minister Gayton McKenzie has responded to EFF student command leader Sihle Lonzis accusations that he has abandoned his cause to fight against illegal immigrants.\n\nLonzi claimed McKenzie has not proposed any legislation on the subject, despite his partys stance on the issue.\n\nThe PA does not care about illegal foreigners, Lonzi said. Never let them lie to you. Its leader McKenzie is now a minister. He has never proposed legislation on the subject, not even a private members bill as an MP. He is just enjoying blue lights.\n\nMcKenzie swiftly responded to Lonzis accusations, asking, Uthini wena Temu Ndlozi? (What are you saying Ndlozi from Temu?). Start by telling us, do you even care?\n\nLonzi, however, was unfazed and accused McKenzie of avoiding parliamentary committee meetings. You must stop running away from parliament committee meetings. I will take you to the cleaners.\n\nThe debate stems from social media users concerns about McKenzies perceived change of attitude towards illegal foreigners.\n\nHowever, McKenzie has always reaffirmed his stance against illegal immigration, saying his partys mission remains unchanged.\n\nI speak up forAbahambe[they must leave] in closed government meetings and PA rallies. I have and will never change my stance regarding the mass deportation of all illegal foreigners but to expect me to only speak about immigration when there is a home affairs minister is wrong.Abahambeis our mission as the PA. We have and will never change. We have taken a decision to fight from within the GNU.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nThe Supreme Court of Appeal has dismissed with costs the Department of Home Affairs attempt to overturn an interim interdict, previously granted in favour of the Zimbabwe Immigration Federation, protectingnearly 200,000 Zimbabwean Exemption Permit (ZEP) holdersagainst arrest and deportation.\n\nAfter winning Part A of the court wrangle, the federation will be heading back to the court, for Part B, to argue before court that the Department of Home Affairs overreached in 2021, when the then home affairs minister Aaron Motsoaledi announced the termination of the ZEP.\n\nThe special permit dispensation has allowed 180,000 Zimbabwean nationals to live and work in South Africa since 2009.\n\nIn the federations view, the jurisdiction to terminate the ZEP lies with Parliament, not the minister.\n\nIOL had an interview with Vindren Magadzire, director of the Zimbabwe Immigration Federation who said his organisations case revolves around the termination of the ZEP programme by the minister of home affairs.\n\nVindren Magadzire, director of the Zimbabwe Immigration Federation Image:Supplied\n\nThe programme allowed approximately 180,000 Zimbabweans to live and work in South Africa. In 2021, the minister of home affairs announced plans to terminate the ZEP permits, sparking legal actions from the Zimbabwe Immigration Federation, Magadzire told IOL.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Immigration Federation was inspired to go through courts due to the South African minister of home affairs decision to terminate the permits. The decision would have significant implications for approximately 180,000 Zimbabweans living and working in South Africa under the ZEP permit program.\n\nMagadzire said his organisation is requesting the superior court to declare the termination of the ZEP permits unlawful, setting aside the termination decision, and protecting permit holders rights.\n\nIn Magadzires view, a lasting solution would be granting the ZEP holders permanent residence status in South Africa.\n\nThe latest development in the court case is that the Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed the minister of home affairs appeal. This decision upholds a Johannesburg High Court interdict that shields approximately 180,000 ZEP holders from arrest and deportation, said Magadzire.\n\nLast year,IOL reported thatthe High Court in Pretoria heard arguments from the Helen Suzman Foundation to enforce the courts order that the ZEP remains valid, while the minister of home affairs conducts a fair and rational inquiry into the impact of its termination.\n\nThe foundation turned to court in a bid to give ZEP holders a lifeline.\n\nWhen the minister first signalled his intention to appeal the courts June 2023 judgment, the foundation asked him to leave the ZEP in place until he exhausted the appeal process. The minister refused, Nicole Fritz, executive director of the foundation said at the time.\n\nThe court had held earlier that the ministers appeal had no prospects of success. Home Affairs then decided to turn to the Supreme Court of Appeal.\n\n",
