Section 54 is clear on this as it sets out the full remit of his powers. In fact, in terms of section 49 the power to appoint heads is exercised during Congress and not anytime thereafter. A power not enshrined in the Constitution cannot lawfully be exercised, Mpofu posted on X.In a blistering attack aimed at Mpofu, Hwende argued that the acclaimed lawyer was missing the political and economic realities that led to the demotion of his namesake Obert Mpofu, stating that the matter was now water under the bridge.Hwende also suggested that the democratic project under the opposition had failed because of people like Mpofu.Zimbabwes political mess has many architects, but a key group are the lawyers-turned-politicians. They are often terrible leaders because they confuse governance with legal analysis, Hwende posted.Their obsession with legal formalism, while ignoring the political and economic substance and realities, has been a major driver of policy paralysis and a disconnect from the populace.Obert Mpofu is gone; a political decision was made. On the 3rd term debate, the focus should now be on mobilising and sensitizing the masses instead of wasting time on analysing the constitution because eventually whatever politics demands will carry the dayMpofu hit back, telling Hwende to steer clear of a discussion he doesnt understand and to focus on his piggery project that he shows off on social media.Muudzei aite zvegango nehochi nyaya dzevanhu vakuru asiyane nadzo.

(Tell him to focus on braai and piggery and back off from crucial discussions, the dull one.)Whoever is close to him ngaamutengere rimwe doro.(Buy him more beer).Hwende, who lost his Parliamentary Public Accounts post due to power struggles within the CCC, is no stranger to controversy.A few months ago, he apologised to former Zengeza West MP Job Sikhala for not pushing hard enough as the opposition for his release from prison, where he was held for nearly two years.Hwende has become a bit of a loose cannon, attacking anyone, especially his former comrades in the opposition.The Kuwadzana East lawmaker may have sealed his fate outside opposition politics with his constant attacks targeting his former colleagues.\n\nA FIGHT has erupted on X, (formerly Twitter), between top Harare lawyer Thabani Mpofu and Kuwadzana East Member of Parliament Charlton Hwende.\n\nThe row saw Hwende taking a swipe at lawyer-cum-politicians, branding political leaders with law backgrounds as unfit for public office, claiming they are obsessed with picking over legal documents.Hwendes jibe indirectly included his former party boss Nelson Chamisa, and one-time fellow party member Fadzayi Mahere, who are both renowned lawyers and political figures.Hwendes remarks came after Mpofu accused President Emmerson Mnangagwa of bending Zanu PFs Constitution with his recent Politburo reshuffle, which saw Obert Mpofu demoted from his position as Secretary General.Nothing in the Zanu PF Constitution vests the First Secretary with the unilateral power to make the reassignments announced.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has dismissed an application by Harare lawyer Emmanuel Mukwewa to rescind a default judgment ordering him and businessman Richard Paswa to jointly repay US$176,000 to Chinese investor Huang Li Qiang over a botched land deal.\n\nJustice Siyabona Musithu ruled that Mukwewa failed to show good and sufficient cause for setting aside the judgment, finding that his explanation for ignoring summons and his alleged defence were both without merit.The applicant failed to give a reasonable explanation for his failure to enter an appearance to defend, the judge said.The purported defence on the merits bears no prospects of success.The dispute arose in September 2023 when Huang entered into what was called an Agreement of Consultancy of Immovable Property drafted by Mukwewa. Under the deal, Paswa was to sell Huang a 20,000 square metre stand in Harares Coca Cola area. Huang paid US$170,000 of the purchase price, but the land was never delivered.In July 2024, after neither Paswa nor Mukwewa filed a defence to Huangs lawsuit, the court granted a default judgment, ordering the pair to refund Huang with interest and costs. The investor had accused Mukwewa of colluding with Paswa to defraud him, alleging the stand was non-existent.Mukwewa argued he only learned of the judgment months later and claimed he was not properly served since the summons was left at his old office gate after he had moved. He further insisted he acted only as a legal practitioner drafting the agreement, not as a party to the transaction.But Musithu rejected this, saying service by affixing was proper under the rules and that Mukwewas conduct in drafting and facilitating the deal went beyond mere legal drafting.The way the applicant handled the transaction, as well as the movement of the funds, was all shrouded in secrecy. It bears all the hallmarks of a fraudulent transaction, and regrettably, with the applicant as the main facilitator, the court ruled.The judge noted that Mukwewa styled the contract as a consultancy deal, yet it clearly amounted to a sale of immovable property which never existed.It gave the impression that the property was in existence at the time the applicant prepared the agreement of sale. Yet, as it turns out, the property did not exist,Musithu said.He added that Mukwewas failure to protect his clients interests, including releasing funds without ensuring title transfer, was professionally negligent at best and fraudulent at worst.The apparent lack of care exhibited by the applicant makes him susceptible to a claim of this nature, the judge concluded.Mukwewas application was dismissed with costs, leaving the default judgment against him and Paswa intact.\n\nJustice Siyabona Musithu ruled that Mukwewa failed to show good and sufficient cause for setting aside the judgment, finding that his explanation for ignoring summons and his alleged defence were both without merit.\n\nThe applicant failed to give a reasonable explanation for his failure to enter an appearance to defend, the judge said.The purported defence on the merits bears no prospects of success.The dispute arose in September 2023 when Huang entered into what was called an Agreement of Consultancy of Immovable Property drafted by Mukwewa.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has struck off a multi-million-dollar damages claim brought by Construction Resources Africa against Central African Building & Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd and its former directors, citing inconsistent papers and improper service of summons on defendants now resident in Australia.\n\nIn a judgment handed down on September 5, 2025, Justice Tawanda Chitapi ruled that the plaintiffs application for default judgment could not succeed because its case was riddled with contradictions and fatal procedural flaws.\n\nThe plaintiffs papers are consequently not in order it is not the duty of the court to do a reconciliation of a litigants papers, which are in contest, inconsistent or incongruent with each other, he said.\n\nThe court also found that service of summons on third and fourth defendants, father and son Jose and Luis Viera was defective, since they were peregrines currently residing in Australia and could not have been validly served in Harare.\n\nThere was therefore no proper service of summons and declaration on the third and fourth defendants,Chitapi held.\n\nConstruction Resources Africa had sued the company and the Vieras for over US$5 million in damages, alleging unjust enrichment and unlawful interference in contracts. The claims included US$260,000 for improvements at a Mount Pleasant property, US$36,000 for improvements in Msasa, US$281,000 refund of purchase price and US$125,000 in lost rentals as well as over US$4 million in alleged lost revenue from aborted construction contracts with Chinhoyi University of Technology and the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA).\n\nThe plaintiff also sought declarations that it retained a right of retention over the disputed properties and that the defendants had been unjustly enriched.\n\nHowever, the judge said the case papers lacked clarity, with glaring inconsistencies in the description of the properties involved. The summons referred to 8 Comet Close, Mount Pleasant and 8 Whitesway, Msasa, while the deeds of sale attached to the claim cited entirely different stands in Beverley East.\n\nJustice Chitapi also rebuked defence counsel Mr. T.S. Manjengwa for attempting to address the court on behalf of the first and second defendants, despite them not being parties to the default judgment application.\n\nMr Manjengwa clearly could not get the courts audience, the judge said, noting that under Rule 39(4)(b) of the High Court rules, a barred party cannot appear in judgment proceedings.\n\nIn the end, the judge struck the matter off the roll, stressing that the claim was fundamentally defective.\n\nIn conclusion, the plaintiffs papers are in disorder, and the relief of default judgment is denied, he ruled.\n\nNow Construction Resources Africa will have to regroup and refile if it intends to pursue its claims, prolonging a dispute that has dragged on for years.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nPAUL Tungwarara, President Emmerson Mnangagwas investment advisor to the United Arab Emirates, and one of the individuals named in the recent corruption dossier tabled at the last Zanu PF Politburo meeting, has insisted he never fled the country.\n\nInstead, he says he simply travelled to Dubai to celebrate his newborn child.\n\nAddressing Zanu PF supporters at a Disbursement of Empowerment Fund meeting in Zvimba on Friday, Tungwarara was positively fired up, vowing to defend Mnangagwa tooth and nail. He declared that no one should even think about toppling Mnangagwa from power.\n\nWe are ready to defend our President and our party, and nothing is going to stop us. Nothing will stop the vision of the President, he asserted.\n\nLeaders are appointed by God. Stop dreaming of toppling the President. If a leader has been appointed by God, it is God himself who will remove him.\n\nTungwararas remarks further illustrate the rising tension in the Zanu PF succession battle, with every opportunity being used to demonstrate loyalty to Mnangagwa. He is considered to be part of a group that Vice President Constantino Chiwenga has labelled Zvigananda, a Shona term for those who amass wealth through illicit means.\n\nHaving been absent from the public eye for a while, social media had been awash with speculation that he had fled the country, fearing for his life. However, the business tycoon has refuted these rumours.\n\nI went to Dubai to see my newborn baby and spent some time there. Then some people started saying I fled the country. Fleeing from who and what? he asked.\n\nTungwarara is among those listed in the corruption dossier tabled by Chiwenga at the last Zanu PF Politburo meeting in Harare. He is mentioned alongside controversial tycoons Kudakwashe Tagwirei, Delish Nguwaya, and Wicknell Chivayo.\n\nThe quartet have been in the public eye for all the wrong reasons, chief among them being allegations of tender process manipulation. Tungwarara himself, through his company Prevail International Group, was awarded the tender to drill 10,000 boreholes under the Presidential Borehole Scheme.\n\nTungwarara was recently given a dressing down by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Agriculture for failing to deliver the boreholes and the Village Business Units as per the terms of the tender.\n\nTungwarara and his colleagues, Tagwirei and Chivayo, have also publicly pledged their support for Mnangagwa, vowing that he is going nowhere.\n\nTagwirei has scoffed at the corruption accusations and challenged Zimbabweans to put in their own tender applications and get some money.\n\n",

Positions being laid off have been outsourced to support financial and operational viability of the business as well as consolidation of the jobs for cost and headcount management, reads the notice in part.In contrast, the affected workers are pushing for a reasonable package, at least, decent enough for one to kick-start a viable project reflecting the years of committed service at a prestigious and well-oiled health facility.What is going on right now at the MIL is a deliberate ploy of sacrificing lowly paid workers. In fact whose salaries are way lesser than some of the executives airtime allowances in the name of easing financial pressures on the entity?If the company is not performing as alleged, why target small jobs and exclude top management who cream off bigger salaries and benefits? alleged one of the workers.Contacted for comment, the Avenues Clinic general manager, Sibusisiwe Ndlovu, alongside the communications officer, did not respond to phone calls and text messages despite blue ticking on Whatsapp.\n\nThe health group, which falls under Medical Investments Limited (MIL) recently tabled plans to lay off 50 workers as part of a strategic decision in the best interests of the company.\n\nFollowing the decision, documents seen by NewZimbabwe.com this week confirmed that the company offered to dole out Service Pay of one months salary for every year served, Notice Pay of three months salary in Lieu of Notice, Payment of Accrued Leave Days and Medical Aid Cover for three months up to December 31, 2025.Over and above the conditions, the company has announced a payment timeframe of six months.Considering that the least-serving employees facing the chop had served for just two and a half years while earning very small salaries, what this offer effectively means is that workers under such a bracket are set to take home just an estimated US$750 before tax.The highest paid workers who had served for about 27 years will be taking home an estimated US$8 500 and this is before tax, alleged one of the affected employees, who preferred anonymity.Another retrenched employee questioned the managements rationale arguing that there is a need to appreciate the services they extended to the organisation over the years by treating them with dignity.A Notice of Retrenchment filed by the MIL to the Retrenchment Board, which was also gleaned by our publication contains three main reasons behind the job cuts.We are embarking on the retrenchment exercise because of restructuring and remodelling of the business for prudent cash flow, management and cost containment.
