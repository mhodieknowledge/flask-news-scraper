The majority of the US Agency for International Developments (USAID) programmes have since been terminated.\n\nMany US-financed HIV treatment and prevention programmes received stop work orders, leading to the closure of mother and baby clinics in Africa, and severe shortages of life saving anti-retroviral (ARV) medicines.\n\nMs Byanyima said she feared a return to the 1990s, when HIV medication was scarcely available in poorer countries, and infections and deaths soared.\n\nThe US has for years been the single biggest funder of HIV treatment and prevention, and Ms Byanima thanked Washington for its generosity and humanity.\n\nShe added it was reasonable for the US to want to reduce its funding  over time, but said the sudden withdrawal of lifesaving support [was] having a devastating impact.\n\nThere has been no sign that Washington is listening to appeals to change course.\n\nTraditional aid donors in Europe also plan funding cuts, and UNAids  the joint UN agency which combats HIV  has had no indication that other countries might step in to fill the gap left by the US.\n\nSpeaking in Geneva on Monday, Ms Byanyima described the case of Juliana, a young woman in Kenya living with HIV. She worked for a US-funded programme that supported new mothers to access treatment to ensure their babies did not develop the disease.\n\nUNAids Executive Director Winnie Byanyima\n\nWith the programme suspended, Ms Byanyima said Juliana was not only out of work but, because she was still breastfeeding her youngest child, she also feared losing the treatment she needed.\n\nPreviously, the World Health Organization (WHO) said eight countries  Nigeria, Kenya, Lesotho, South Sudan, Burkina Faso, Mali, Haiti and Ukraine  could soon run out of HIV drugs after the US funding pause.\n\nWHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned that disruption to HIV programmes could undo 20 years of progress.\n\nIn February, South Africas leading Aids lobby group, the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), warned the country could see a return to when HIV patients struggled to access necessary services for their treatment.\n\nWe cant afford to die, we cant afford to go back to those years where we were suffering with access to services, especially for people living with HIV treatment, said TAC chair Sibongile Tshabalala.\n\nMs Byanyima also proposed a deal to the Trump administration, offering an opportunity to market a new US-developed ARV to millions of people.\n\nLenacapavir, made by US company Gilead, is given by injection every six months, with UNAids believing 10 million people could benefit from it.\n\nThe profits and jobs resulting from such a deal would be hugely beneficial to the US, Ms Byanyima added.\n\nUNAids is one of a number of UN agencies facing funding cuts.\n\nThe UN Refugee Agency has suggested it may have to lose 6,000 jobs, while Unicef has warned that progress to reduce child mortality is threatened, and the World Food Programme has had to cut rations in famine threatened regions.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nMinister of Sport, Arts and Culture, Gayton McKenzie has expressed joy and anticipation after Zimbabwes Minister of Sports, Art and Recreation, swimming sensation Kirsty Coventry has become the first woman and African to be elected president of theInternational Olympic Committee (IOC).\n\nAt 41, the two-time Olympic swimming champion is also the youngest ever elected to be the most powerful person in sports governance. She will begin her eight-year term in charge of the IOC in June.\n\nIOL has previously reported thatmoments after Coventry was elected the 10th president of the IOC, she told the audience at the 144th IOC Session in Costa Navarino, Greece, on Thursday: I hope that this vote will be an inspiration to many people. Today glass ceilings were shattered, and I am fully aware of my responsibilities as a role model.\n\nIn South Africa, McKenzie said Coventrys ascension to world sports top job signals a welcome step forward in the global dynamics of sport administration.\n\nWe must pay tribute to the work of the outgoing president of the IOC, Dr Thomas Bach, who received us so warmly and respectfully as a member country at Olympic House, after paying an official visit to South Africa last year, said McKenzie.\n\nTo know that the reins are being passed to an individual as accomplished and outspoken as Kirsty Coventry fills us with hope for the future of world sport, and Africa and the Global Souths place in it.\n\nKirsty Coventry\n\nMcKenzie also spoke glowingly of Coventrys achievements.\n\nShe was already the most decorated Olympian in African history, with seven medals, including two golds.\n\nShe has now reached the highest of pinnacles in all of sport, added Minister McKenzie, paying tribute to the strong support Coventry was given by IOC members, winning the election on the first ballot, with 49 votes.\n\nThis achievement is a proud moment for all of Africa. I look forward to engaging the president-elect personally in days to come, and to express my support for all the hard work that we know still lies ahead.\n\nSpokesperson for the Department of Sport, Arts and Culture, Stacey-Lee Khojane said since becoming minister in 2024, McKenzie has used the platform tirelessly to argue the case for the end of what he has termed sports apartheid, where some of the worlds premier sporting tournaments never see expression through hosting in Africa.\n\nWhile numerous countries have hosted multiple Olympic Games, the entire continent of Africa has never hosted one, said Khojane.\n\nIn a move towards changing this imbalance, South Africa lodged an Expression of Interest to host the 2036 Olympic and Paralympic Games with the IOC in Switzerland in November of 2024, in a ministerial delegation that included the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee, with the support of IOC Member in South Africa, Anant Singh, and IOC Honorary Member Sam Ramsamy.\n\nIOL reported last week that Coventrys election to global sports most powerful position marks a significant advancementin breaking glass ceilings that have historically sidelined women from leadership roles in sports. Her triumph stands as a beacon of hope for underrepresented voices in a field traditionally dominated by men.\n\nIn her acceptance speech, Coventry said: This is an extraordinary moment. As a nine-year-old girl, I never thought Id be standing up here one day, getting to give back to this incredible movement of ours.\n\nThis is not just a huge honour but is a reminder of my commitment to every single one of you that I will lead this organisation with so much pride, with the values at the core. And I will make all of you very, very proud, and hopefully extremely confident in the decision that you have taken today. Now weve got some work together.\n\n",

My daughter will be released. Im hopeful, he said in an interview with Newzroom Afrika.\n\nIn an emotional plea, Goitsemodimo expressed his distress about the harmful rumours.\n\nWe were shocked to see fake news trending in the news media to the fact that my daughter has been executed, and this has been speculated by heartless people who are not sensitive enough to accommodate the parents, relatives and friends of Lesedi, he said.\n\nMy daughter is still alive  as you might be aware, she is in prison in Bangladesh. We have made an appeal, and she cannot be executed while that is being processed.\n\nLesedis arrest came as a shock to her family, especially her father, who revealed that he had no knowledge of her trip to Bangladesh.\n\nLesedi was not working. She was staying in Gaborone with her elder sister, and before her arrest she visited us in December. She left us around January 18 2022. We were really shocked.\n\nGoitsemodimo said his daughter is alive and he has been in communication with her every week.\n\nI speak to Lesedi every Friday through her lawyer in Bangladesh. Even last Friday, we talked. Shes still healthy, but the problem is that shes suffering from depression after being in prison for more than three years.\n\nGoitsemodimo said he is in contact with Lesedis lawyers and they have filed an appeal. They are awaiting a response from the judges.\n\nThe Botswana government has also been actively assisting in the case, with efforts to have Lesedi extradited to Botswana for prosecution.\n\nGoitsemodimo expressed his gratitude for the support from Botswanas government, particularly fromPresident Duma Boko.\n\nIm very happy with the diplomatic efforts made by the president in assisting the family to secure a pardon for Lesedi. He is doing his best and Im quite happy with the level of assistance.\n\nHe condemned those responsible for circulating the false reports of his daughters execution. This has affected us a lot because we are still working around the clock to assist my daughter, together with the government of Botswana, and these people are starting to speculate. It is really affecting us.\n\nHe also expressed frustration with the way some individuals on social media have handled the situation: Those people who are spreading heartless fake news are really affecting us. We appeal to all the people using news media platforms to assist us by praying for my daughter instead of spreading these rumours. It feels like we have taken part in the offence that has been committed by my daughter, and that is not right.\n\nIm not happy with how people are commenting on social media. Some even seem to want to hear that my daughter has been executed.\n\nGoitsemodimo said once Lesedi is released, he plans to support her recovery.\n\nThe first thing I will do [is] just take for counselling. I will take her to professionals so that they can counsel her, and then well sit down and talk as to why she went to Bangladesh, because she never informed us.\n\n",

She became the first woman and African president to hold this prestigious position in IOCs 131-year history.\n\nThis is not only a proud achievement for Coventry herself, but also for her nation, Zimbabwe, and the entire African continent. Her election is a powerful inspiration to people around the world, especially women, who see her as a symbol of perseverance, excellence and leadership.\n\nCoventrys victory has also been warmly celebrated in China as Zimbabwes Golden Girl enjoys a huge fan base here. Her athletic career is nothing short of remarkable: winning seven Olympic medals, more than anyone else from Africa, including one gold and three silvers medals earned at the 2008 Beijing Olympics.\n\nI had the privilege of interviewing Coventy in January 2022, just before she visited the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics as an IOC member. She shared with me how Beijing means to her personally, especially the National Aquatics Center, also known as the Water Cube, where she achieved some of her greatest Olympic successes.\n\nAnd that iconic Water Cube, transformed into an ice rink for the Winter Olympics, was something she was eager to revisit.\n\nBeijing has a warm place in my heart. Obviously, thats where I won my Olympic medals, a gold and three silvers. Im excited to go back and cheer on our athletes of the world, watching athletes live out their Olympic dream, especially in the Water Cube, which will be interesting to see how different it looks now.\n\nDuring our conversation, Coventry also emphasized her dedication to promoting exchanges in sport, culture and art between Zimbabwe and China.\n\nUnder my portfolio, its not just sport, its also art and culture. I think China does an incredible job of being proud of your culture and your heritage, and thats something that were really trying to emphasize as a ministry.\n\nId love to be able to have a little bit more work alongside the Chinese counterparts to achieve a little bit more of that and learn from China in terms of how you structured your cultural lessons, your museums, things like that. That for me is really important in order to be able to have a strong identity as a Zimbabwean people, as a Zimbabwean culture.\n\nCoventrys vision is reflected in her IOC presidential manifesto, where she advocates for using sport as a bridge between countries and cultures, a source of hope, and a force for good. She also pledged to tackle inequality in sports, with a strong focus on promoting womens participation and ensuring equal opportunities for female athletes at every level.\n\nWhat many may not know is that after retiring from professional sport in 2016  having competed in five Olympic Games  Coventry launched a charitable initiative to provide sports education to underprivileged children. Her goal was to give young people a chance to discover their potential and pursue careers in sports.\n\nHer actions have already made a meaningful difference in the lives of ordinary people. Now, as the new president of the IOC, Coventry has an even greater platform to bring about positive change. Her leadership promises to inspire and uplift not just Zimbabwe and Africa, but the global sporting community as a whole.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nTHE Two Oceans is not only the worlds most beautiful marathon but also Africas biggest event thanks to its massive contribution to the Western Capes revenue.\n\nThis much was confirmed by a study from 2017, and the organisers of this years edition of the 56km ultra, its half-marathon, as well as the trail runs, plus the Cape Town International Friendship Run, believe that the impact will be even bigger.\n\nThe Two Oceans Marathon organisers say they have record highs of international entries for this years races, taking place over the weekend of April 5 in the Mother City. The race will have an incredible 98 countries represented in the different events.\n\nExpectedly, South Africans will form the bulk of the participants. Neighbours Namibia and Zimbabwe will send 839 and 798 runners each, respectively, to carry their flags. The UK is in fourth place with 337 participants. For this years race, a total of about 4 500 internationals are coming over.\n\nIt is the fact that the race has attracted runners from every conceivable corner of the world that excites the organisers, with countries such as Mauritania, Malaysia, Ecuador, Slovakia, Palestine, and New Zealand, to mention just a few.\n\nIts an honour to be welcoming more than 4 500 internationals from a record 98 countries to our shores  the highest number of countries to be represented in the history of our Two Oceans Marathon event. This speaks to the truly globally iconic nature of our race, said race manager Hilton Kearns.\n\nIt confirms to them that the Two Oceans truly is the worlds most beautiful marathon. After all, this is a race of which it was said byThe New York Timesonce that If theres one race you must run in your lifetime, it has to be the Two Oceans. Endorsements surely dont come bigger than this one, do they?\n\nAnd with good reason too, as the 56km ultra takes runners on arguably the most scenic road of any road race in the worldaround Chapmans Peak.\n\nWe are striving to make the 2025 event a memorable one for our international runners, and it is fitting that in a year of record international entries, weve also managed to bring back the Cape Town International Friendship Run, Kearns continued.\n\nThe benefits are particularly felt by the city and the province, given the contribution the visiting internationals make to the economy. The Two Oceans Marathon weekend is said to create about 4 000 temporary jobs, a number not surpassed by any of the countrys other major running events. And thats what the economic impact is pegged on.\n\nWe are, of course, also pleased at the important ancillary impact this kind of tourism pull has on the local economy, and to be recognised at the highest levels as an event thats important in this context, Kearns adds.\n\n",

According to ZIMCHE, while some qualifications are awarded to unsuspecting individuals duped out of their money, others are willing accomplices.\n\nIn a statement, the ZIMCHE said some unregistered institutions had ignored a directive to shut down and were still issuing fake degrees.\n\nAs the regulatory authority mandated under The ZIMCHE Act [Chapter 25:27], the ZIMCHE is committed to safeguarding the standards, quality, and credibility of Zimbabwes Higher Education System. In this regard, unregistered institutions are unequivocally warned to cease operations immediately, withdraw all fraudulent qualifications, and desist from issuing or conferring any degrees, including purportedly earned and honorary PhDs, reads the statement.\n\nRecipients of fraudulent qualifications and false titles are strongly advised to stop using these credentials or risk legal consequences, including civil and criminal prosecution.\n\nTo protect stakeholders, including students, employers, and the public, the ZIMCHE has initiated investigations into these unlawful activities. Appropriate legal measures will be taken against both unregistered institutions and individuals found complicit in academic fraud.\n\nZIMCHE urged the public to verify learning institutions before enrolling.\n\nMembers of the public are urged to exercise vigilance by verifying the accreditation status of such Institutions with the ZIMCHE before enrolling in any programmes. Similarly, employers are encouraged to thoroughly authenticate qualifications presented by prospective employees with the ZIMCHE. Members of the public should always be on the lookout for unregistered institutions, that in some cases frequently change their locations to evade detection.\n\nSome of these institutions are not owned by Zimbabweans, while others claim affiliation with dubious international universities that are not even registered and accredited in their countries of origin.\n\n",
