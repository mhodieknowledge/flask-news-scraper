            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nThe Zanu PF political landscape is increasingly volatile, and if current tensions are not carefully managed, the party could face an implosion that threatens its key structures and processes, a political analyst has warned.\n\nIn an interview withNewZimbabwe.com, political analyst Eldred Masunungure said the outcome of the ruling partys ongoing succession battle will hinge on who holds the strategic cards within the power structure.\n\nMasunungure cautioned that delegates attending the ongoing Zanu PF National Peoples Conference in Mutare must address internal divisions decisively to prevent a full-blown crisis.\n\nThe long and short of it is that the Zanu PF pot is overboiling and if not managed well, it may very well explode.\n\nIt is therefore incumbent upon the National Peoples Conference managers to sharpen their conflict resolution skills to abate a dangerous fallout, Masunungure said.\n\nThe conference, currently underway in Mutare is expected to deliberate on key issues including the ailing economy, corruption, and the 2030 agenda. However, the gathering has been overshadowed by factional wars between camps aligned to President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his deputy Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nDuring a Politburo meeting on Tuesday, Chiwenga reportedly questioned why Mnangagwa had not taken action against individuals named in a corruption dossier he presented earlier. Those implicated include controversial businessmen Wicknell Chivayo, Kudakwashe Tagwirei, and gold dealer Pedzai Sakupwanya, who are accused of stealing millions from state coffers.\n\nThe dossier has triggered a fierce backlash from Mnangagwas loyalists, including Zanu PF Secretary for Legal Affairs Ziyambi Ziyambi and party spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa, both of whom have publicly attacked the Vice President.\n\nIn response to the dossier, Ziyambi described Chiwenga as ignorant and accused him of treason, while Mutsvangwa slammed the VP for turning the presidium into a kangaroo court.\n\nCommenting on the power struggle, Masunungure said the decisive factor will be which camp is able to outmanoeuvre the other.\n\nThe critical factor depends on who is capable of outmanoeuvring the other or, to use Donald Trumps language, who has the cards?.\n\nFrom the vantage point of an outsider looking in, it appears like the incumbent Mnangagwa has most of the strategic cards courtesy of the power of incumbency, both in the party and the state.\n\nChiwengas military base has been significantly eroded and cannot be relied on to mount another military-assisted transition. The balance of evidence suggests that Mnangagwa will emerge the winner, on account of the manipulation of incumbency.\n\nRecent changes within Zanu PF have further fuelled speculation of a deliberate purge of Chiwengas allies.\n\nMnangagwa recently removed Obert Mpofu from the influential Secretary General post, reassigning him to the ICT department, and replaced him with Jacob Mudenda.\n\nWithin days, he also dismissed Zanu PF Director General Ezekiel Zabanyana, a move widely seen as an effort to weaken Chiwengas internal support base.\n\nMasunungure warned that the escalating factionalism could spill beyond the party, affecting national governance.\n\nThe fallout will most probably infect the state, its key organs and processes. More broadly, it will further deepen and widen the already worrying societal polarisation.\n\nZanu PF is expected to hold its elective congress in 2027, where the partys succession question may be resolved. Some of the resolutions from the Mutare conference are expected to be implemented in the lead-up to that crucial event.\n\n",

Its a big problem that needs to get real attention, said Munetsi.\n\nWhile there are no official statistics on the number of players defrauded by bogus agents, FIFPro has intensified awareness campaigns across Africa to help players identify legitimate representation and avoid exploitation.\n\n",

We should have 22 companies patrolling our borders, but currently there are only 15. Even these face critical shortages of personnel, vehicles and modern surveillance tools like drones, he said.\n\nThis admission paints a bleak picture of a defence force stretched thin across vast and often inhospitable border terrain.\n\nThe SANDF highlighted further challenges, citing insufficient manpower to monitor the borders shared with Zimbabwe, Botswana and Mozambique. Soldiers are required to patrol hundreds of kilometres with limited resources, and the presence of informal settlements near the Limpopo River has complicated matters, with some residents allegedly assisting illegal crossings.\n\nDakota Legoete, chair of the PCDMV, was equally candid.\n\nIf we are being honest, we dont have functioning borders  and that puts the safety of our country at risk, he said. His comments were echoed by Mr Phiroane Phala, co-chair of the JSCOD, who emphasised the need to balance diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries and the imperative of national security. We cannot allow people to enter and leave the country without control, he said.\n\nCommittee members witnessed the dilapidated state of border fences and identified several areas where illegal crossings are rampant. Soldiers stationed in these zones shared their frustrations over the lack of numbers and support, saying they are unable to effectively monitor the largely unregulated movement of people.\n\nIn response, the committees have pledged to strengthen their oversight efforts.\n\nThey are advocating for increased funding, improved coordination between departments and modernised border infrastructure. They also plan to engage key stakeholders  including the Border Management Authority, the SANDF, the SAPS and SARS  to develop a more unified response to the crisis, with particular focus on the Beitbridge border post.\n\nThe visit comes at a pivotal moment in South Africas border control strategy, underlining the urgency of interdepartmental cooperation and renewed investment in national security infrastructure.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nHuge crowds of mourners in Kenya fled screaming after police fired gunshots and tear gas in a stadium where they had gathered to see the body of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga.\n\nSeveral people at the arena, located in the capital Nairobi, were reportedly injured in the chaos as security officers sought to disperse the surging crowds.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether the police were using live ammunition or rubber bullets.\n\nOdingas body was flown back from India, where he died on Wednesday morning. Thousands of supporters had earlier travelled to the countrys main airport to receive the coffin, in an outpouring of grief that forced a brief halt to flights.\n\nThe authorities said mourners had gained access to restricted areas, prompting a precautionary closure that lasted about two hours.\n\nFrom the airport, thousands of people moved in a procession to escort the vehicle carrying the body to the stadium, about 10km (six miles) from the city centre.\n\nBecause of the unexpectedly large crowds, the public viewing ceremony for Odingas body was moved to Nairobis Moi International Sports Centre in the Kasarani neighbourhood, rather than inside the parliament building where it was initially scheduled to take place.\n\nThe convoy arrived to a packed stadium, with more people waiting outside.\n\nMinutes afterwards, a large crowd breached a gate in the arena, prompting the police to fire tear gas. Masses of mourners rushed towards the exits in response.\n\nA BBC reporter at the scene also saw men in civilian clothing beating protesters with batons.\n\nAt least three people were visibly injured and one had a serious head wound, the AFP news agency reported.\n\nAfter the chaos had settled, government officials and dignitaries were able to view it the coffin.\n\nA stream of supporters had earlier gathered at Lee Funeral Home, where the body was first expected, and around parliament.\n\nI came here at six in the morning. We have been at the airport to welcome Baba [Odingas nickname], one mourner had told the BBC near the airport.\n\nWe are sad, we have been left as orphans. He is our father.\n\nMotorcycle rider William Otieno Adoyo said he was a Baba die-hard.\n\nWe want to see Baba, how do we know its him in the casket? Let them show us and well be contented, he told the BBC.\n\nMourners have been carrying twigs and palm branches, a symbol of mourning and grief among the Luo ethnic group that Odinga belonged to.\n\nThe state funeral will be held at the Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi on Friday and on Saturday his body will be transported to Kisumu, a city in western Kenya on the shores of Lake Victoria  his political stronghold.\n\nMembers of the public will get a chance to view the body before he is buried on Sunday at his farm in Bondo, about 60km west of Kisumu.\n\nAccording to the family, it was Odingas wish to be laid to rest within the shortest time possible, ideally within 72 hours.\n\nThe 80-year-old former prime minister collapsed during a morning walk in India on Wednesday morning and he was taken to Devamatha Hospital, about 50km (30 miles) east of the port city of Kochi.\n\nA seven-day period of mourning has been declared. Odinga will also be accorded a state funeral with full military honours, Kenyan President William Ruto said.\n\nHe was towering figure in Kenyan politics and for many years was the countrys main opposition leader, losing five presidential campaigns, most recently three years ago.\n\n",
