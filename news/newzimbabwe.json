The bulk of the crop has not yet reached the productive phase and it is critical that rains continue into the month of February and March, Mutenha said.\n\nWhat is obtaining on the ground is that 12% has just emerged because farmers planted late, 31% is between two to four pair leaves 32% is between four to six pair leaves and 18% is squaring and 7 % is at flowering to ball stages.\n\nGenerally, the plants are looking good. If it continues to rain into February and March, we should expect a good harvest. The first crop assessment is underway to assessment is underway, he added.\n\nOver 200,000 hectares have been put under cotton this season due to the seamless distribution of inputs.\n\nA farmer classification system introduced last year, was used to distribute inputs. Farmers were grouped into three classes based on their history in farming, hectarage, and loyalty to COTTCO.\n\nMutenha also said COTTCO had settled part of the money owed to farmers from last season, with the remaining amount in local currency to be paid before the start of this years marketing season.\n\nFor the 2023  2024 marketing season, COTCCO managed to pay 100% of the US$ component which is 75% an amount US$400 000 payable in ZiG and representing 25% is what is outstanding.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE retail sector in Zimbabwe is faced with a crisis following the closure of several branches, including those of reputable retailers and wholesalers owing to myriad factors.\n\nThis Thursday, President Emmerson Mnangagwa interrupted his annual leave to chair an urgent meeting with senior government officials, amid an unabating collapse of Zimbabwes formal retail and wholesale sector.\n\nThe crisis indaba, attended by Vice Presidents Constantino Chiwenga and Kembo Mohadi as well as Economic Ministries.\n\nIn a statement after the crisis meeting, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube lamented the growing informalisation of the economy and its effects on formal businesses.\n\nHis Excellency, the President, Dr. E.D. Mnangagwa, yesterday took time off his annual leave to chair a session on developments in the economy designed to map the way forward, Ncube said.\n\nThe session, which also included the two Vice Presidents and all Economic Ministries, deliberated on measures Government has taken on the economy, and developments in specific economic sectors, including the retail subsector. This culminated in additional measures being proposed.\n\nNcube said while Zimbabwe had seen economic growth averaging 5.5% annually since 2021, a slowdown of 2% in 2024largely due to an El Nio-induced droughthad impacted agriculture, electricity generation, and the broader economy.\n\nThe minister also admitted that the informalisation of the retail and wholesale sectors was a growing challenge.\n\nResearch and consultations indicate that some of the reasons formal businesses are experiencing distress include competition from the informal sector, poor management and poor corporate governance which have resulted in business failure in some instances.\n\nThe proliferation of smuggled importsmostly in reserved sectorssold exclusively in USD, and the high cost of doing business, among others, also contribute to the formal sector challenges, he said.\n\nTo combat these issues, Ncube outlined several measures, including the mandatory use of point-of-sale machines by informal traders, discouraging manufacturers from directly supplying the informal market, and the establishment of a Domestic Interagency Enforcement Team.\n\nGovernment will embark on an exercise to streamline regulatory processes, fees and charges, as well as duplication of work by Government Agencies, in order to reduce the cost of doing business, he added.\n\nFurther measures include enforcing compliance with the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act, incentivizing industrialisation, and promoting local procurement.\n\nGovernment is committed to improving the business environment, in order to curb the informalisation of the economy, as we move towards Vision 2030, Ncube said.\n\nThe meeting came after Confederation of Zimbabwe Retailers (CZR) raised concern over the dire state of formal businesses, citing an unfavorable economic environment. CZR President Denford Mutashu highlighted challenges such as the dual currency system, regulatory burdens, and punitive taxes that have pushed consumers toward the informal sector.\n\nThe Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has penalized companies each time they deviated from the official exchange rate, despite suppliers insisting on cash payments at prevailing parallel market rates.\n\nThe crisis reflects broader economic challenges, though insiders suggest some recovery efforts are underway. As the government scrambles for solutions, the formal retail sector remains on the edge, posing a significant risk to Zimbabwes economic stability.\n\nMajor retailer such as Spar, OK Supermarkets, Choppies Zimbabwe, Surrey, among others, have either closed shop or downsized in the wake of adverse factors affecting viability of business.\n\nThe N. Richards Group has closed several outlets, while OK Zimbabwes shelves remain empty, unable to pay suppliers after the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe mandated pricing at the official exchange rate. TM Pick n Pay, owing suppliers over US$40 million, is also under pressure.\n\nOK Zimbabwe is reportedly now restocking and poised for a comeback after the government allowed the company to adjust its pricing to mid-market rates, which will allow the retailer to settle supplier debts and replenish its stock.\n\nIn Chinhoyi, the Surrey branch closed this Friday resulting in the redundancy of at least 15 employees.\n\n",

SADC appreciates the support rendered by international cooperating partners, in response to the critical needs of the displaced populations.\n\nHowever, more must be done to alleviate the situation. The people of the eastern DRC have suffered for far too long, Mnangagwa said.\n\nThe SADC chair also denounced in strongest terms the attacks by the M23 rebels.\n\nFurther, SADC condemns in the strongest terms the attacks by aggressor forces. While we pause to mourn our loss, our resolve to ensure collective security cannot be shaken.\n\nThe importance of dialogue and peace building for the benefit of the people of the Eastern DRC must be boldly pursued.\n\nTo this end, our region stands ready to intensify efforts to protect the SADC citizens from all forms of instability, in line with the SADC Mutual Defence Pact, Mnangagwa added.\n\n",
