            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nWHILE the government has faced backlash over the ban on the importation and sale of second-hand clothing in cities, Harare Mayor Jacob Mafume has backed the move, saying the capital cannot be turned into a city of bales.\n\nThe Minister of Local Government and Public Works, Daniel Garwe, earlier this week reaffirmed a ban on second-hand clothes, known asbhero,alongside night vending.\n\nSpeaking during a full council session on Thursday, Mafume stated that Harare cannot be sustained by second-hand clothes.\n\nIt is a serious dichotomy. We can not have a society that aspires to wear second-hand clothes. It is a serious oxymoron; we have cotton we can not make new clothes. So we wait for the cotton to be exported and clothes to be manufactured, and they are worn before we wear them.\n\nOn the other hand, we have some in our midst wearing second-hand clothes. We must assist each other as a society. We need to deal with it in a sensitive manner, but at the same time, we can not sustain a city based on second-hand clothes.\n\nDespite their importation ban by the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA), second-hand clothes have provided relief for cash-strapped individuals due to their affordability.\n\nThe ban on the importation of second-hand clothes was implemented by ZIMRA in 2015, but due to porous borders, they continue to flood the streets, being sold at cheaper prices.\n\nIn Harare, second-hand clothes are also sold at night, a practice the government is also banning.\n\nThe Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) has since condemned the move as autocratic, particularly in an economy reliant on the informal sector.\n\nThe Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) notes with deep concern the position taken by the Ministry of Local Government on banning the selling of second-hand clothing and street vending\n\nThis intervention by the Ministry of Local Government is a clear reflection of the failure of the implementation of devolution within the local authority, the decision was made from an autocratic position\n\nThe City of Harare has to run the operations within the City in accordance with Section 264 of the Constitution, the procedure should be done in accordance with the Constitution.\n\nThe informal sector has for years been complementing the formal sector as there has been an emergence of formal businesses operating 24/7 in the CBD over the years, reads the statement by CHRA.\n\n",

She never visited any either alone or with any other person as alleged or at all.\n\nShe did not cast any spell on anyone as alleged or at all, read her defence outline.\n\nThe lawyer said his client will tell the court that the charges are a malicious fabrication of a vindictive former maid who is manipulating the current bad blood between the accused and the complainant.\n\nThe former maid had been relieved of her duties and is bitter about it.\n\nMhandu also said Butau filed the current report as a social media blitz against her and for the purpose of countering a report she made against her at Highlands Police Station on 4 August 2025 under RRB Number 6440490.\n\nShe will also state that the allegations against her do not amount to any practice associated with witchcraft.\n\nFurther, the allegations are vague and embarrassing.

Independent candidate Peter Nyapetwa received only 23 votes. The main opposition party, Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), did not participate in the by-election.\n\nMwonzora, who boycotted the 2023 presidential elections, surprisingly fielded a candidate in Epworth who performed poorly, triggering widespread criticism from opposition supporters.\n\nSpeaking in an X space on Wednesday, Mwonzora said the by-election was a test to assess whether the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) had implemented electoral reforms.\n\nZEC produced a document called a strategy towards free and fair elections, so we decided to test ZECs attempted electoral reforms empirically. ZEC failed dismally in the test.\n\nThere was rampant vote buying, as Epworth residents were being given food hampers on election day. We have video evidence of that. People were receiving EcoCash and being told to vote for Zanu PF.\n\nThey also received threats from Zanu PF and were told that if they voted for the MDC, the 16,000 houses in Epworth would be destroyed.\n\nWe, the MDC party, were given a soft copy of the voters roll, but it would not open. We made a formal complaint to ZEC, which did nothing about it, Mwonzora said.\n\nMwonzora urged other opposition parties to unite against Zanu PF instead of mocking him for losing the by-election.\n\nThe poor performance is not confined to the MDC; it is a trend, and as the opposition, we must work to change it.\n\nThere is a need to bury the hatchet. As we have seen, there is no winner in a losing team. We need to work together. If we are not careful, Zimbabwe will become a mono-state.\n\nYes, we may want to score political points by mocking the MDC, which lost only one by-election, yet other opposition parties lost 45, Mwonzora said.\n\n",

Well, theres good news and theres bad news.\n\nEating chips has been found to raise the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but baking, boiling or mashing potatoes was much healthier.\n\nConsuming french fries three times a week increases the chances of someone getting the disease by 20%  and doing so five times a week by 27%  according to a study published in the British Medical Journal.\n\nGlobally, potatoes are thethird most commonly consumed food crop, after rice and wheat.\n\nNine out of 10 of the estimated 5.8 million people in the UK with diabetes have the type 2 version of the disease, which is closely associated with lifestyle, especially diet.\n\nThe findings confirm potatoes do not of themselves pose a danger to health, but frying them to turn them into chips, and eating them regularly, does make a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes more likely.\n\nAn international team of researchers, led by Seyed Mohammad Mousavi, a public health expert at Harvard University, investigated the relationship between potato intake and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. They based their findings on food questionnaires filled out by 205,000 health professionals in the US every four years between 1984 and 2021.\n\nSomeone who eats chips three times a week was found to raise their risk of diabetes by 20%, but those who ate potatoes with the same regularity after baking, boiling or mashing them did so by only 5%.\n\nThe high starch content of potatoes, leading to a high glycemic index and load, combined with possible loss of nutrients and possible health risks resulting from various cooking methods, could contribute to adverse health outcomes, the study explains.\n\nReplacing potatoes with whole grains lowers the risk of diabetes by 8%, and if grains are eaten instead of chips specifically, that cuts the risk by 19%.\n\nDr Kawther Hashem, a lecturer in public health nutrition at Queen Mary University of London, said: Potatoes can be part of a healthy diet, but its how we prepare them that makes the difference. Boiled, baked or mashed potatoes are naturally low in fat and a source of fibre, vitamin C and potassium.\n\nBut when we deep fry them into chips or french fries, especially in large portions and with added salt, they become less healthy with their high-fat, salt and calorie content thats much more likely to contribute to weight gain and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\nHowever, replacing any form of potatoes with white rice is a bad idea as it leads to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, the paper found.\n\nDr Hashem added: This research reinforces the simple message, which is to enjoy potatoes  just dont rely on chips as your go-to option. And, where possible, try swapping them out for whole grains like brown rice, bulgur wheat, wholemeal pasta or even sweet potato with skin on, which are healthier and protective for long-term health.\n\nThe researchers stressed their findings were observational and did not prove a cause and effect relationship between eating chips and type 2 diabetes risk.\n\nThe Food Standards Agency and Department of Health and Social Care both declined to comment.\n\n",
