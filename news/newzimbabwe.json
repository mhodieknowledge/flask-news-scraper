Zimbabwes brightest football talent has sparked a bidding war as Highlanders FC demand a jaw-dropping R15 million for teenage winger Prince Ndlovu The move has sent shockwaves through South African football circles, an SA publication wrote.\n\nNdlovu, often referred to as the next Peter Ndlovu, has long attracted interest from top clubs, having previously trained with the Buccaneers in Houghton before a failed European stint. Now, with his stock soaring, Highlanders are playing hardball.\n\nHighlanders FC value Prince (Ndlovu) and thats why they are pricing him at around R15 million. The club believe its a fair price looking at his talent, quality and future ahead of him, a club official said, as quoted by Soccer Laduma.\n\nHighlanders play the long game as bids loom\n\nThe Bulawayo giants arent rushing to cash in. Their valuation isnt just based on local interest, its also shaped by serious attention from abroad.\n\nApart from Orlando Pirates there is a European club that has been monitoring him for some time now. Its Sturm Graz from the Austria Bundesliga, a source revealed.\n\nThis European connection could tip the scale and inflate the price further.\n\nA R15 million fee would rank among the highest for any player moving directly from the Zimbabwe Premier Soccer League. Its a bold statement from Highlanders, and a sign of just how highly they rate the 19-year-old winger.\n\nNdlovu was recently donning national colours at the COSAFA Cup in Bloemfontein, offering football scouts from across the continent a front-row seat to evaluate his explosive potential. Pirates are believed to have sent representatives to monitor him closely.\n\n",

            "content": "By Emma Batha I Thomson Reuters Foundation\n\nWhats the context?\n\nZola believed a job in Britains care sector would lead to a better life. But now she is homeless and in debt  this is her story\n\nLONDON Thousands of overseas workers hired by care companies across Britain have been left broke and desperate after losing their jobs in what campaigners say is a national crisis.\n\nIn 2022, Britain launched a visa scheme to encourage migrant workers to bolster its ailing care sector. About 150,000 have arrived from countries including India, Nigeria and Zimbabwe.\n\nBut reports of exploitation have soared.\n\nThe government has since banned hundreds of companies from sponsoring migrant workers  but this has left carers they had already hired jobless and terrified of deportation.\n\nZola, a 45-year-old Zimbabwean care worker, was recruited by a firm in the northern city of Leeds in 2023 but is now 10,000 ($13,500) in debt.\n\nShe told her story to Context but asked to use a pseudonym for fear of repercussions.\n\nThe way weve been treated is outrageous. We were encouraged to come here to contribute our skills, but the jobs never materialised and now were trapped in debt.\n\nWe came here in good faith, but other people have used us to fatten their own pockets. Revoking these companies licences is not enough. They need to be held accountable, and so does the government.\n\nThe first shock when I arrived was the accommodation. They promised us housing, but the property was crammed with people and under renovation. There were bed bugs, there was no heating and we had to use a bucket to wash ourselves.\n\nI thought Id start work immediately, but they kept saying they were losing clients and didnt have shifts.\n\nI think they had hired about 100 of us because we were all in a large WhatsApp group. My annual salary was supposed to be 20,480, but I only received a few shifts and was paid 930 in total in all the time I was with the company.\n\nWe were caring for people in their own homes. Shifts started early and finished at 10 at night, but they only paid for the time you spent in clients homes, not the time you were on call.\n\nBy October, it was very cold outside and we had nowhere to go between appointments so Id spend hours riding around and around the city on buses just to stay warm.\n\nIf the carers complained about anything, the managers would threaten to remove them from the rota or report them to the Home Office. Everyone was afraid of losing their visa and getting deported. There were constant threats.\n\nThen last year the company lost its sponsor licence so I have to find a new sponsor.\n\nThe emotional and financial strain has affected me very badly mentally, especially as my children are still in Harare.\n\nWhen I applied for my visa, the government said carers could bring their children. I was hoping my children would join me once I got established, but that never happened.\n\nNow I dread calls from home  I took the job hoping to create a better life for my children, but I cant even provide them with the basics, which breaks my heart. Sometimes my daughter is crying because she misses me. Its gut-wrenching.\n\nBack in Zimbabwe, I was working as a sales rep for a farm, but they were struggling to keep afloat. Im a single mum with three kids so I needed to find something else.\n\nMy sister told me the UK was looking for care workers so I quit my job and did a Red Cross course and a work placement to get experience.\n\nI heard about a company that would sponsor me for 5,000. It seemed expensive, but some people were paying 10,000. I only discovered later it was illegal to charge these fees.\n\nI borrowed money from friends and relatives and my kids moved in with my mum. There were other expenses for things like an English test, police background check, my visa and flight, so altogether I paid about 7,000.\n\nBut Ive had to borrow even more money since coming here just to survive. Ive had to use food banks or ask for groceries from the church. A friend of my sister has given me a place to sleep.\n\nIts very difficult to find a new sponsor because companies providing home care ask for a driving licence. Another problem is they often want six months experience, but some carers lost their jobs soon after arriving here.\n\nThe government is partly to blame because they allowed these companies to sponsor a lot of people without doing background checks to see if they had enough work for everyone.\n\nSo yes, the government should be held accountable. I came here through the proper channels, I did everything they asked, and now Im treated like someone who came through the back door.\n\nIve thought about going back to Zimbabwe so many times, but then I remember how much I owe everyone. Im just hoping theres light at the end of the tunnel.\n\n($1 = 0.7408 pounds)\n\n(Reporting by Emma Batha; Editing by Ana Nicolaci da Costa.)\n\nContext is powered by the Thomson Reuters Foundation Newsroom.\n\n",
