            "content": "By Business Report\n\nTHE diversified company, propelled by its mining sector which is seeing new orders for its regional markets on the back of a rebound in copper and battery metals, achieved robust results and delivered bumper dividends.\n\nOmnia Holdings delivered a resilient performance for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2025 despite set backs in the agriculture division, which was impacted by currency issues in Zimbabwe, drought in Zambia, and the civil unrest in Mozambique.\n\nThe diversified company, propelled by its mining sector which is seeing new orders for its regional markets on the back of a rebound in copper and battery metals, achieved robust results and delivered bumper dividends.\n\nThe agri business Zambia, Zimbabwe and Mozambique didnt perform well, Seelan Gobalsamy, CEO of Omnia told Business Report in an interview.\n\nZimbabwe had the usual currency issues and a lot of uncertainty (and) we had some regulatory challenges and in Zambia, we saw a massive drought that impacted revenue.\n\nThe unrest that rocked Mozambique in 2024 and early into this year also affected Omnia. The company had to send products via Namibia into Zambia as routes through Mozambique were disturbed by the unrest, impacting working capital and profits negatively.\n\nWith strong performance from Agriculture RSA and mining segment, Omnias revenues for the year to the end of March grew 2.7% to R22.82 billion. Mining has emerged as Omnias strongest business from an outdoor projective.\n\nThere is still a strong demand for metals, you know, the metals that drive that transition to cleaner energy, you know, the battery metals, uranium. So, we are positively disposed to the mining market, and we are winning new customers, renewing new customers, explained Gobalsamy.\n\nHeadline earnings per share increased by 1% to 704 cents, while operating profit remained unchanged at R1.7bn despite the inclusion of the Chemicals restructuring costs, along with the impact of severe drought conditions and currency depreciation in Agriculture Rest of Africa.\n\nThe Mining segment delivered an improved operating margin of 12.4% from 12.1%, supported by strong performance from Mining RSA and Mining International, as well as higher throughput and efficiencies.\n\nIn the mining sector, sustained demand for critical minerals supporting the global energy transition, underpinned exploration activity and supported positive fundamentals for the explosives market.\n\nHowever, geopolitical tensions and trade policy uncertainty presented ongoing risks.\n\nThe group had a net cash balance of R1.77bn was down from R2.3bn.\n\nThe board declared a total dividend of 675 cents per share for the year. This comprises an increased ordinary dividend of 400 cents, from 375 cents the prior year, and a special dividend of 275 cents per share, returning R1.1bn to shareholders.\n\nDespite persistent macroeconomic headwinds, Omnia delivered sustained profitability and continued to create long-term value for shareholders. This performance reflects the strength, quality, and growing diversity of our portfolio, underpinned by a sharpened focus on manufacturing efficiency, supply chain resilience, and customer-driven innovation, Gobalsamy said\n\nThe increased ordinary dividend payout, and special dividend declared is a clear signal of our confidence in the sustainability of our earnings and the successful execution of our growth and diversification strategy.\n\nLooking ahead, Omnia said the outlook for its Agriculture segment remained positive, driven by expected improvements in agronomic conditions across key regions such as the proprietary Nutriology model.\n\nOmnia said 2026 will be a significant transition year in which non-core assets and business lines will be sold, capital released and returns improved.\n\n",

It is widely considered a critical juncture for Zimbabwes reform agenda.\n\nWhile the Staff Monitored Programme (SMP) does not provide funding, its successful implementation is a prerequisite for future access to concessional financing, potential debt restructuring, and the restoration of confidence among international creditors and investorsall of which Zimbabwe desperately needs.The southern African nation is burdened with a burgeoning public debt that has now exceeded US$21 billion, including more than US$12.3 billion owed to external creditors.Following the visit, IMF Mission Chief Maliszewski said the IMF would like to see a fully functioning local ZiG currency and fiscal discipline with a balance between expenditure and revenue.He also addressed the issue of corruption and stressed the need for a genuine currency exchange market, as well as a credible debt restructuring process.In an attempt to put a positive spin on this, Mangwana posted on his X account his own interpretation of the IMFs comments.The IMF sees macroeconomic stability in Zimbabwe we see it too. They want to see the ZIG becoming fully our national currency  we want that too. They see the ZIG stability we are witnesses.However, Mahere, who is also a constitutional lawyer, strongly disagreed with Mangwanas sentiments.Did you listen carefully to what the IMF representative is actually saying? These are the key takeaways: This Govt has no fiscal discipline. Fiscal discipline is urgently required. The public financial management system is worrisome. Read theres too much corruption.The people need reassurance that the so-called reforms introduced will stay. Read theres no trust or public confidence in what the Govt says about the state of the economy.The ZIG is not yet a national currency. While it may look stable, it is not widely used. The official exchange rate is artificial as demonstrated by the existence of a parallel market rate. The fact that the two dont converge is problematic. You can rig an election but you cannot rig the economy, Mahere wrote on her X account in response to Mangwana.Fourteen months after its introduction, the ZiG currency is still failing to facilitate payments for essential services such as passport issuance, fuel, and other necessities, indicating its shortcomings.The private sector, particularly Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), does not accept ZiG as a form of payment in its daily transactions, leaving many, especially civil servants, searching for US dollars on the parallel market, where the exchange rate is US$1: 40 ZiG, even though the Treasury has set the official exchange rate at US$1: 27 ZiG.\n\nWhile the Staff Monitored Programme (SMP) does not provide funding, its successful implementation is a prerequisite for future access to concessional financing, potential debt restructuring, and the restoration of confidence among international creditors and investorsall of which Zimbabwe desperately needs.\n\nThe southern African nation is burdened with a burgeoning public debt that has now exceeded US$21 billion, including more than US$12.3 billion owed to external creditors.\n\nFollowing the visit, IMF Mission Chief Maliszewski said the IMF would like to see a fully functioning local ZiG currency and fiscal discipline with a balance between expenditure and revenue.\n\nHe also addressed the issue of corruption and stressed the need for a genuine currency exchange market, as well as a credible debt restructuring process.\n\nIn an attempt to put a positive spin on this, Mangwana posted on his X account his own interpretation of the IMFs comments.\n\nThe IMF sees macroeconomic stability in Zimbabwe we see it too.

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/mps-call-for-pit-bull-terrier-ban-in-zimbabwe-say-dog-breed-has-become-dangerous-to-citizens/",
            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nDISTURBED by the deadly Pit Bull Terrier dogs vicious and fatal attack of a Harare resident recently, legislators want the breed banned in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Pit Bull Terrier, commonly known as Pitbull, is an aggressive type of canine.\n\nMembers of Parliament (MPs) suggested to the Speaker Jacob Mudenda during a Question and Answer session this Wednesday that the dog breed known as Pitbull had become a threat to peoples lives as it is not wired to obey instructions like some of the breeds, hence, it should be banned in the country.\n\nThe call comes barely a fortnight after a man was mauled to death by the terrifying dogs in Bluff Hill, Harare.\n\nZanu PF Goromonzi West MP Biata Beatrice Karimatsenga- Nyamupinga raised concern over the pets-turned-killers.\n\nWhen moving in the bush we fear being killed by wild animals but when we are moving in the residential areas there are dogs such as the Pitbull.\n\nThe Pitbull is killing people. That dog does not listen to instructions from the owner. What is the government policy on the keeping of animals, in particular dogs like the Pitbull?\n\nResponding to the question, Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi, who is also Leader of Government Business in Parliament, said the law, through councils, clearly stated that a dog owner should have a licence.\n\nThat law clearly states the number of dogs which are allowed in each and every household in towns. In other areas there are no dogs which are allowed.\n\nThat is why the individual who kept a Pitbull which killed someone was arrested. The police apprehended him because it was against the law. The Pitbull needs a licence which is different from other types of dogs because it is a very vicious dog, Ziyambi said.\n\nIn her supplementary question, Karimatsenga-Nyamupinga, however, disputed that the licence itself was not enough to stop such deadly attacks seen in the past week.\n\nShe highlighted that the Pitbull loses its memory, hence needs to be outlawed.\n\nYes, the licence can be there but we have that type of dog which loses its memory. What are we trying to say if we are allowing people to keep dogs which lose their memory? What are we trying to say about the lives of people? the MP stated.\n\nZiyambi told Mudenda that her question could only be responded to by the Veterinary Department, adding she should put the question in writing for further investigation from experts.\n\nThe government policy clearly indicates that for someone to keep dogs, they must be given a licence. If we want to go deeper on the types of licence and groups, it really needs to be written down so that we can go and consult the experts.\n\nIt will be easier for each and every individual in this august House and the rest of the country to understand the requirements needed to keep Pitbull dogs, Ziyambi explained.\n\nMudenda ordered the MP to put her question in writing, as it needed further clarification.\n\nChinhoyi MP Leslie Mhangwa added his weight to the conversation.\n\nlf we have somebody who has become a danger to the community, he is put in jail or put somewhere else.\n\nThe Pitbull as a breed has become a danger to the people of Zimbabwe. Is there anything that stops us from banning the breed within the country? I think this is the direction we need to move with.\n\nThe Speaker made a ruling that the question by Karimatsenga-Nyamupinga be put in writing and be dealt with next week.\n\nA Harare man, Samuel Machara was recently killed by Pitbulls owned by Mike Mupinga (40) of Bluff Hill in Harare, who was arrested and charged with culpable homicide.\n\nIn 2022, a Bulawayo man from Selborne suburb was also bitten to death by his own canines.\n\nTwelve countries in Europe, as well as Australia, Canada, some parts of the United States, Ecuador, Malaysia, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, and Venezuela, have enacted some form of breed-specific legislation on Pitbull-type dogs, including American Pit Bull Terriers, ranging from outright bans to restrictions and conditions on ownership.\n\nSeveral states in Australia place restrictions on the breed, including mandatory sterilisation. Pitbulls are banned in the United Kingdom, in the Canadian province of Ontario, and in many locations in the United States.\n\n",

You could not disrespect the office of the president, Trump said in an interview with NBC on Sunday.Musk appeared to have deleted many of his posts over the weekend, including one calling for Trumps impeachment.Musk was the largest donor for Trumps 2024 presidential campaign and had been considered the presidents right-hand man.Former Trump aide Steve Bannon called for Musk, who was born in South Africa, to be deported.US Vice-President JD Vance told reporters on Wednesday that while Trump was frustrated with Musk, the president does not want a long-term feud with the Tesla CEO.Vance also said he had spoken to both Trump and Musk about the billionaire donor remaining supportive of the administration.Most Republicans have called for the two men to reconcile, while Democrats have watched on as the feud unfolded.Their fallout came shortly after Musk left the task force he headed called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), which he had promised would make trillions of dollars of federal spending cuts, 129 days into the job.So far, those cuts appear to have been smaller. After his departure, many of the Doge staff he hired have stayed on at a variety of federal agencies.\n\nIn response, Trump said Musk had lost his mind and threatened to cancel his government contracts, which have an estimated value of $38bn (28bn).
