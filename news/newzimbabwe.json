            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans living in the diaspora. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. This week, we want to discuss labour and employment law in Zimbabwe for foreign or diaspora businesses that want to invest in Zimbabwe. What are the main compliance requirements for companies wanting to employ workers in Zimbabwe?\n\nVM: The question is broad, but I will attempt to summarise in my response. Fundamental to all employment in Zimbabwe are the labour rights guaranteed by our Constitution, being among others, the right to be paid a reasonable and fair wage, right to fair and safe labour practices and right to join a trade union. The employment relationship must guarantee those rights.\n\nThe employer, being a foreign business, is required to register first with the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) as an employer and, if employing some foreign nationals as part of the business, to follow work permit or visa rules and establish contracts for the businesss employees.\n\nThere is also a need to comply with Statutory National Employment Council regulations governing the particular sector, National Social Security Authority (NSSA) requirements, collective bargaining agreements, trade unions and the corresponding remittances.\n\nReporter:How key are employment contracts and what specific provisions must be included in the contracts?\n\nVM: The employment contract is the crux of the employment relationship, whether written or verbal, it must comply with the law and applicable collective bargaining agreements for the sector the business operates. The contract is founded on the old contract principles of offer and acceptance, consideration and capacity to enter into contracts.\n\nAn oral contract that meets all the requirements of a contract is therefore binding on the parties as a legally enforceable employment relationship.\n\nFor diaspora or foreign companies, employment contracts must be in writing detailing whether the employment contract is permanent, fixed term or casual. The contract will be expected to observe and address, among other things, issues relating to fair wages, overtime and leave benefits, termination and dispute resolution processes.\n\nReporter: In what circumstances can an employer terminate a contract?\n\nVM: Termination of employment has to be lawful and is first governed by the employment contract. So, termination can be mutually agreed upon between the employer and employee. It can also be a result of effluxion of time being for instance, expiration of a fixed-term contract or in circumstances where an employee was employed to perform a specific task and the task has been completed.\n\nTermination may also be in terms of the employment code, in its absence, the model code and lastly as part of retrenchment in accordance with the law. What is critical is that the termination is done in terms of the law so that the employer does not suffer a claim for unfair dismissal from the employee.\n\nReporter: In the event of disputes between employer and employee, which may include a claim for unfair dismissal, what methods are provided in law to address these?\n\nVM: Disputes in the workplace are common, and the contracts of employment must prescribe the dispute resolution model. The contract must offer alternative dispute resolution models for addressing the disputes, which may include negotiation, conciliation, mediation and arbitration.\n\nOur law also prescribes forums that address certain disputes arising from the employment contracts, so it is important to know and understand such to avoid procedural irregularities.\n\nThe commonly used alternative dispute resolution model in Zimbabwe is conciliation. This method is intended to resolve disputes through labour officers, whose mandate is to settle the employer/ employee disagreement by encouraging them to explore potential options and solutions by offering new perspectives. In the event that the conciliation process fails, the labour officers will issue a certificate of no settlement, resulting in voluntary or compulsory arbitration.\n\nIt is important to remember that disputes must be referred to the labour officers timely, that is, within 2 years, otherwise the issues under dispute may be affected by prescription, denying the complainant of their right to be heard. The Labour Court is available to review the processes carried on by inferior tribunals or on appeal.\n\nReporter: What specific challenges do you think that foreign companies face when trying to comply with our labour laws?\n\nVM: Our labour laws have undergone changes and foreign companies may fail to keep updated with the amendments. Some of the foreign companies use contract templates that do not meet our legal standards. It is advisable to engage local experts at the commencement of business to ensure that the employment contracts are aligned with our laws.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima, we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

Instead of nursing hangovers, they sit with eyes closed and bodies in meditative poses on the bare floor.Its an unlikely setting for a yoga class. In Zimbabwe, the practice is rare and mostly found in the wealthy suburbs. Yet it is quietly taking root here in a beer tavern in Chitungwiza, a low-income town 30 kilometers (18 miles) outside the capital, Harare.The initiative is led by Actions Winya, a yoga instructor who saw how economic hardship and social pressures were damaging the mental health of people in his hometown.Yoga is expensive  but we also got humans in the ghetto. They need mental wellness, said Winya, who usually teaches in affluent areas, charging between $30 and $100 a month. Thats an impossible cost for most, especially in a country where many survive through informal jobs.Since 2023, Winya has been offering free weekend classes to some of those hardest hit by Zimbabwes economic problems.The sessions have become a source of relief for people navigating relentless challenges.Authorities acknowledge a growing societal crisis worsened by drug abuse, domestic violence and poverty, compounded by a shortage of public health services and therapists.I am a coach, so they bring the stuff that they face within families (to me). This is where we come in and say, Guys, come and try yoga, it can help somehow, Winya said.Yoga, an ancient Indian practice, has become a multibillion-dollar industry and a daily ritual for millions around the world. The United Nations over a decade ago designated June 21 as International Day of Yoga.In Africa, other countries like Kenya and South Africa are introducing yoga to poorer communities, with the Indian government promoting its spread across the continent.Inside the tavern in Zimbabwe, mellow music played as about a dozen participants moved through poses. They had no mats, just a cold brick floor, but plenty of determination for inner peace. One mother tried to stay focused as her toddler dashed around, disrupting her poses.For 47-year-old John Mahwaya, the practice has been transforming. A father of four, he also supports relatives in the countryside, a responsibility he said once weighed heavily on his mental health.My head was always spinning. I thought I was losing my mind, and the stress started causing back pains, he said. Yoga helps me relax and clear my mind. I sleep peacefully these days.He said many Zimbabwean men bottle up their emotions, afraid to show weakness in a highly patriarchal society that prizes toughness.We focus on physical fitness, forgetting the mind, he said. We suffer slowly, but what suffers first is the mind, and from there, it becomes a slow death.Edinah Makosa, 24, joined the class earlier this year and said it gave her hope.I used to be depressed a lot. You know, for people my age, our main stressors are unemployment and relationships, she said.Yoga changed my mindset. I used to think negatively all the time. Now I have started selling beauty products to earn a living. As for romance, well if it works, it works; if it doesnt, it doesnt. I no longer stress about men. I go with the flow.As they practiced, the sounds of township life seeped in. Taxi drivers shouted for passengers. Vendors pushed carts, calling out to potential customers.We need a proper environment and studio. But we are trying, Winya said.For participants like Mahwaya, the location didnt matter nearly as much as the healing.We need to promote yoga in the communities because everyone has a mind.

And fitness of the mind is the responsibility of everyone, regardless of where you live, he said.\n\nSince 2023, Winya has been offering free weekend classes to some of those hardest hit by Zimbabwes economic problems.\n\nThe sessions have become a source of relief for people navigating relentless challenges.Authorities acknowledge a growing societal crisis worsened by drug abuse, domestic violence and poverty, compounded by a shortage of public health services and therapists.I am a coach, so they bring the stuff that they face within families (to me). This is where we come in and say, Guys, come and try yoga, it can help somehow, Winya said.Yoga, an ancient Indian practice, has become a multibillion-dollar industry and a daily ritual for millions around the world. The United Nations over a decade ago designated June 21 as International Day of Yoga.In Africa, other countries like Kenya and South Africa are introducing yoga to poorer communities, with the Indian government promoting its spread across the continent.Inside the tavern in Zimbabwe, mellow music played as about a dozen participants moved through poses. They had no mats, just a cold brick floor, but plenty of determination for inner peace. One mother tried to stay focused as her toddler dashed around, disrupting her poses.For 47-year-old John Mahwaya, the practice has been transforming.

You know, for people my age, our main stressors are unemployment and relationships, she said.Yoga changed my mindset. I used to think negatively all the time.

            "content": "By AFP\n\nFIRST impressions can be deceptive, but Kirsty Coventry showed that behind a sunny disposition she will have the mettle to deal with the trickiest of people and situations when she succeeds Thomas Bach as president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Monday.\n\nLooming large on the horizon of the 41-year-old Zimbabwean  the first woman and African to occupy the post of the most powerful single figure in sport is US President Donald Trump.With Los Angeles hosting the 2028 Olympics, Trump will feature often on Coventrys agenda.Trump has not been shy in giving public dressing downs to world leaders  notably Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa.Judging by Coventrys initial response, after a crushing first-round victory in the presidential election in March, she may have Trumps measure.Navigating Challenges and Embracing Failure: Lessons from Coventrys CareerI have been dealing with, lets say, difficult men in high positions since I was 20 years old, she said, adding communication will be key.Unlike Trump, though, Coventry embraces the word failure, for it helped forge her stellar career.Everythings scary. Embrace that. You have to fail, Coventry told the swimming team at her American alma mater Auburn University last year.Ive learned the best lessons by failing, and I have failed at many things. Life has a really good way of humbling you.At the same time that steely resolve comes to the surface when winning is at stake.I was banned from playing card games with the family, because they didnt like to deal with me when I lost, she said.A Glance at Coventrys CV Suggests Failure in Her Life Has Been RelativeCoventry, who had the Olympic rings tattooed on a leg after her first Games in 2000, is a two-time Olympic gold medallist and she has contributed seven of Zimbabwes overall Games medals tally of eight.She has accrued domestic political experience, as she was Zimbabwes Minister for Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation from 2019 to this year.That attracted some flak as she was serving in a government whose election in 2023 was declared to be neither free nor fair by the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ).I dont think you can stand on the sidelines and scream and shout for change, she said in her defence.I believe you have to be seated at the table to try and create it.Her record as a minister has been heavily criticised by the Zimbabwean arts community in particular.Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, whose predecessor Robert Mugabe labelled Coventry a golden girl and awarded her $100,000 after she came back with a gold medal from Beijing in 2008, hit back.Whoever was not impressed by her can appoint someone else when they become president, said the 82-year-old.Very hard timesIn 2004, Coventry gave an insight into why she would later accept such a poisoned chalice and how whites in Zimbabwe have to perform a delicate balancing act.Zimbabwe is my home, she said after returning to a heroines parade after winning her first gold medal at the Athens Olympics.Its where I was born. Its my culture. I will always represent Zimbabwe. Colour doesnt matter to me.I think every country goes through bad years and good years.Coventry had a largely urban upbringing. Her parents Rob and Linn owned a chemicals firm in a suburb of Harare, but the farming evictions where predominantly white farm owners were forced off their lands in their early 2000s  affected her too.I have had very close family members and friends on farms who have gone through very hard times, said Coventry.Away from the controversies she has shown decisive leadership in dealing with Zimbabwean football chiefs and FIFA.She backed the government body Sports and Recreation Commission (SRC) when it suspended the Zimbabwean Football Association (ZIFA) over allegations of fraud and sexual harassment of referees.FIFA has a zero tolerance policy of political interference in its associations and barred Zimbabwe from international football in February 2022.However, by September the same year they were back in the fold.

            "content": "By The Telegraph India\n\nA TEAM of officers from Kolkata Police arrested Tinashe Gadzikwa Praise, 22, Malvern Matungamire, 25, and Nyamhunga Lenon Kudakwashe, 23, from different apartments in Mohalis Kharar, where the three had been living for some time.\n\nThey were arrested from Mohali in Punjab on Saturday for allegedly duping a Tollygunge resident out of over 1 crore in an investment fraud.\n\nTinashe is from Mutare; Malvern from Masvingo; and Nyamhunga from Bindura, the police said. All three cities are in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe three Zimbabwean nationals lured Sandip Guha of Tollygunge to invest in the trading of kola nuts and assured high returns. They created fake email addresses, WhatsApp accounts and used fake letterheads of the World Health Organisation (WHO) and a global healthcare pharmaceutical company in the UK to convince the victim for investing, a senior police officer said.\n\nKola nuts are derived from kola trees, which grow in the tropical rainforests of Africa and are popular for their high caffeine content.\n\nInvestigators said the three Zimbabweans told Guha that this was the best time to invest in kola nuts because there is a global demand in the pharma industry for these nuts. They managed to convince Guha that the bigger the investment, the higher the returns.\n\nEven the WHO is considering the health benefits of kola nuts, the three told the complainant impersonating officials of the pharma giant and the WHO, the officer said.\n\nHowever, after Guha transferred 1 crore to the bank accounts of the trio, they could not be contacted.\n\nThis is when Guha realised he had been duped. He lodged a police complaint on May 20.\n\nA case was drawn up at cyber police station under the Information Technology Act, and a probe was initiated.\n\nA team of officers began checking the details of the transactions and followed the money trail.\n\nSenior officers said the three were traced to a location in Punjab and a team from Kolkata Police left for the State.\n\nFollowing the arrest of the trio, six mobile phones, a laptop and some bank documents were seized from their possession.\n\n",
