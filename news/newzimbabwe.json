            "content": "BBC\n\nA South African influencer linked to a controversial job scheme in Russia has apologised for her role in promoting it in a country where many young people are desperate to find jobs.\n\nCyan Boujee, whose real name is Honour Zuma, came under scrutiny after one of the videos she posted online advertising jobs for women aged between 18 and 22 went viral.\n\nIt prompted the government to issue a warning about the scheme and alert people to the dangers of human trafficking and unverified job opportunities overseas.\n\nImmediately when I saw the comments on my stories and on my videos I knew that this is not something I stand with, the 24-year-old told her 902,000 followers on Instagram.\n\nPopularly known as Cyan, the influencer has removed the promotional videos from her social media pages. They had described an opportunity for a fresh new start for young women at the start of their careers.\n\nIn a video shot in Tatarstan in Russia and posted over the weekend on TikTok, where she has 1.7 million followers, Cyan had said it was a two-year start programme for those wanting to acquire professional skills  though it was not made clear in what professions.\n\nShe had explained those hired would be given jobs and taught how to speak Russian.\n\nThere have been allegations that some of those recruited to work in Tatarstan have ended up working in a weapons factory, making drones that have been used in Russias war in Ukraine.\n\nIn her Instagram apology, Cyan acknowledged that human trafficking is a very, very serious matter, adding that the backlash had been a huge learning curve for her and and all the other influencers.\n\nI knew this is something I had to delete immediately, I didnt care about the money, she said.\n\nI apologise and I believe that this is not something that will be repeated again.\n\nThere has been a huge fallout on social media over the job videos, with a petition launched calling on influencers to use their platforms to instead spread awareness about the signs and dangers of trafficking.\n\nThe authorities have launched an investigation into the scheme. Deputy Justice Minister Andries Nel said so-called opportunities were often linked to serious risks of labour exploitation and human trafficking.\n\nNever rely solely on social media promotions or unsolicited social media advertisements, always cross-check and verify job opportunities through official channels, he said on Wednesday.\n\nOne of the main recruiters in the scheme promoted by Cyan and other influencers is a special economic zone in Tatarstan, which is where weapons are believed to be produced.\n\nA report by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime released in May looked into the recruitment of people for the start programme.\n\nIt said that potential recruits are enticed to participate under false pretences regarding the nature of the work, the working conditions and opportunities for education, adding that the objective is to support the drone production programme.\n\nMost work directly in drone production, while others work as support staff  cleaners and caterers.\n\nIn one of her now-deleted videos, Cyan had said apparently girls are treated fairly here  Africans, Asians, Latin Americans.\n\n",
