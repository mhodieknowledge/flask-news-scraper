            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe government has laid the foundation for the second phase of its economic recovery and growth roadmap under the banner of the National Development Strategy (NDS 2), a successor of the first phase of the ambitious plan.\n\nThis Wednesday, the government presented the NDS 2 Roadmap and National Priorities at the Manna Resort in Harare, marking the start of a process to craft the countrys five-year economic blueprint 2026-2030.\n\nThe indaba drew participants from industry and commerce, farmers organisations, the clergy, civil society and academia.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the event, Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion, Mthuli Ncube, said a draft of NDS 2 should be ready by October.\n\nThe NDS 2 will be a successor to NDS 1. We have appointed consultants to do an evaluation of NDS 1 and their observations will serve as the base for NDS 2, which will be crafted following wide consultations, at the provincial and district levels. We should have a draft ready by October, said Ncube.\n\nAlthough Ncube emphasised that as NDS 1 approaches its end in December 2025, Zimbabwe remains solidly on track to attain an upper-middle-income society status, poverty and unemployment remain widespread among the general populace. The nation is reeling from a liquidity crunch amid a faltering Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency.\n\nNcube said NDS 2 will serve as the crucial five-year plan to leapfrog the country towards the ambitious Vision 2030, by which Zimbabwe will attain upper-middle-class society status.\n\nNcube said chairpersons of 10 national priorities that will underpin the strategy were hitting the ground running to contribute to the national document.\n\nThe final document is expected to be tabled by November 2025, ahead of the National Budget presentation. Thereafter, it will be officially launched by the President.\n\nFollowing NDS 2s launch, Ncube said there will be public awareness campaigns by amplifiers to extensively disseminate its contents so that there is buy-in for the important national blueprint.\n\n",
