            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE United Nations (UN) Human Rights Committee has urged authorities to align pretrial detentions with international best practices, an end to judicial interference, among other rights-related recommendations.\n\nIn a report published Tuesday, the Committee on Civil and Political Rights (CCPR), also known as the UN Human Rights Committee, established a number of gaps after analyzing progress made by Zimbabwe in the implementation of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) by its State Parties.\n\nThe recommendations coincide with a series of complaints raised by a number of arrested rights activists who believe they were placed in unfair pretrial detentions.\n\nThere is a need to ensure that pretrial detention is reviewed in a prompt, thorough and impartial manner by the relevant judicial authorities, including through the effective implementation of the right to habeas corpus, and that anyone detained arbitrarily is released without conditions and is adequately compensated, the report reads.\n\nThe Committee expressed concerns about reports of threats, intimidation, and dismissal of judges who issue rulings that are unfavorable to the government. It raised concerns about the persistent shortage of judges, which contributes to significant delays in the administration of justice, particularly in high-profile cases related to human rights violations and corruption.\n\nThe State Party must take immediate steps to prevent and eradicate all threats, intimidations and other forms of undue influence on the judiciary by the executive branches of government and to ensure in law and in practice the full independence and impartiality of judges, including by adopting procedures for the selection, appointment, promotion, sanction and removal of judges that are transparent and impartial, the report added.\n\nWhile commending the measures taken by the State party to enhance judicial efficiency and reduce case backlogs through the rollout of the Integrated Electronic Case Management System and the decentralisation of the High Court, the Committee noted the barriers to accessing this system due to low smartphone and internet coverage, high data costs and digital literacy gaps, particularly in rural communities.\n\nThe report also challenged the Statepartyto elucidate all cases of enforced disappearances and conduct impartial and thorough investigations without delay, ensuring that the victims and their relatives are informed of the progress and results of the investigation.\n\nIt called for the identification of those responsible and ensuring that they are prosecuted and, if convicted, punished with appropriate penalties that are commensurate with the gravity of their crimes and that victims of enforced disappearance and their families are provided with full reparation.\n\nThe experts said the government should allocate sufficient human and financial resources to the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission to enable it to discharge its mandate effectively and independently, including plans to enhance its field presence in full compliance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles).\n\n",

            "content": "By Adekeye Adebajo\n\nPRETORIA  The Irish playwright George Bernard Shaw is often credited with saying, I learned long ago never to wrestle with a pig. You get dirty, and besides, the pig likes it. Such is South Africas dilemma in dealing with US President Donald Trumps bombastic administration.\n\nA struggle of some kind cannot be avoided, because Trump already threw down the gauntlet (probably at the urging of Elon Musk, a South African migr) when he offered white South African farmers refuge in the United States, falsely claiming that they are being persecuted. His administration then topped that off by ending all US aid to South Africa and expelling South Africas ambassador, Ebrahim Rasool, for suggesting that Trump had tapped into a supremacist instinct.\n\nWhile these moves ought to have been enough to freeze bilateral relations, the two governments will be interacting regularly, because South Africa is due to hand over the rotating G20 presidency to the US in November. That process will not be easy. Trump has already taken a wrecking ball to multilateral institutions and the broader international order, having withdrawn the US from the World Health Organization and the Paris climate agreement, gutted USAID, and sought to undermine the sovereignty of Canada, Denmark, and Panama  all longstanding US allies. The Trump administrations refusal to send its Secretary of State and Treasury secretary to the G20 meetings in Johannesburg and Cape Town last month suggests that much turbulence lies ahead.\n\nSouth Africa has four key priorities for its G20 presidency: strengthening global disaster resilience and response; ensuring debt sustainability; mobilizing funding for a just energy transition; and using critical minerals for sustainable development and inclusive growth. It has also pushed the G20s 23 working groups to stick to technical issues, while leaving political matters  such as the wars in Ukraine and Gaza  to the sherpas, foreign ministers, and heads of state. And there are a variety of G20 task forces focusing on inclusive economic growth, industrialization, employment, inequality, food security, AI, data governance, and innovation for sustainable development.\n\nAt the G20 foreign ministers meeting in Johannesburg on February 20-21, South Africas Minister of International Relations and Cooperation, Ronald Lamola, outlined his governments full agenda for the group. He pushed for accelerated implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). He bemoaned the rise of supply-chain disruptions, trade restrictions, unilateral sanctions, and economic coercion. And he warned that political divisions are creating a global climate of distrust.\n\nLamola then called for renewed efforts to address the high debt burdens across the Global South, and urged the G20 to focus on conflict prevention and peacebuilding, climate change, pandemic prevention, nuclear nonproliferation, development financing, and reforms to global governance institutions. He then concluded by promising a report evaluating the first full cycle of G20 presidencies by November 2025. The G20 finance meeting, held shortly thereafter, covered similar issues.\n\nThe US, now controlled by a personality cult that rejects the very principle of multilateralism, has played a spoiler role within the G20 since late January. It is almost as if Trump has exported his domestic war on wokeness to the international stage. One obvious reason for boycotting the recent ministerial meetings, for example, was to punish South Africa for bringing a genocide case against Israel at the International Court of Justice.\n\nMeanwhile, lower-level American officials who do attend international meetings dutifully repeat their dear leaders words. The US was the only country to oppose a recent UN General Assembly resolution reaffirming the right of everyone to an education; and, within the G20, it has opposed commonsense clean-energy proposals  reflecting Trumps insistence that climate change is a hoax.\n\nRather than support South Africas theme of solidarity, equality, and sustainability, Trump has embraced unilateralism, inequality, and nationalism. In obstructing the G20s agenda, his administration has occasionally been joined by Italys right-wing government and Argentinas anarcho-capitalist regime. This terrible triplet sees issues such as gender equality, clean energy, and the SDGs as somehow threatening their own sovereignty. They are the reason why the G20 failed to issue the traditional diplomatic communiqus following the recent ministerial meetings. Instead, the South African chair released non-binding short summaries that sought to capture the key outcomes of both meetings.\n\nFortunately, the European Union has provided consistently strong support for the South African G20 presidency. At a summit this month, the EU pledged to invest $5.1 billion (in grants and loans) in South Africa, which many saw as a move to replace the aid that Trump recently cut. The EU has also offered its support for the African Unions Agenda 2063, the G20 Compact with African economies, the SDGs, UN Security Council reform, development financing, World Trade Organization reform, and climate action.\n\nBut many EU countries are also cutting development aid to Africa  albeit in a quieter fashion than the Trump administration has done. Across the Global South, many fear that those pushing a vision of Fortress Europe  anti-migration policies, agricultural protectionism, and draconian trade policies toward Africa  are gaining momentum.\n\nBy contrast, South Africa continues to receive much support from other governments across Africa and the rest of the Global South. Brazilian President Luiz Incio Lula da Silva, for example, has emerged as an especially strong ally.\n\nSouth Africas indefatigable, overstretched diplomats arrived in New York last week (March 24-30) to outline their priorities at the UN General Assembly and try to mend fences with a surly US administration. Though South African President Cyril Ramaphosas government has laid a solid foundation for future progress despite US-led disruptions, the next round of negotiations at the Johannesburg G20 summit in November will be immensely challenging. Trump, who once described Africa as a continent of shithole countries, is not expected to attend.\n\nAdekeye Adebajo, a professor and a senior research fellow at the University of Pretorias Centre for the Advancement of Scholarship in South Africa, served on UN missions in South Africa, Western Sahara, and Iraq.
