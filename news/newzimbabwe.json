            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nUNITED Kingdoms (UK) Minister for Africa, Lord Ray Collins, the first British cabinet member to visit in seven years, has confirmed their softened stance towards Zimbabwe and talked of a new approach towards the continent and former colony.\n\nCollins, who visited President Emmerson Mnangagwa at State House on Wednesday, said Prime Minister Keir Starmers government had crafted a new approach that emphasised on listening rather than talking, on Africas agenda and not only theirs.\n\nHis watered-down comments come barely a month after the UK struck off former Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) boss Isaac Moyo, former police Commissioner General Godwin Matanga, ministers Anselem Sanyatwe, Owen Ncube and the Zimbabwe Defence Industries (ZDI) from its sanctions list.\n\nSanyatwe gained infamy for testifying, during an August 1, 2018, Commission of Inquiry in defence of soldiers, who gunned down innocent lives in Harare. Moyo and Matanga formed part of Mnangagwas brutal security apparatus, specifically targeted at dissenting political and human rights activists.\n\nWe are absolutely committed to building a partnership based on equality and respect but on a simple mission of economic growth, growth that can support both our people (and) creating a win-win situation, said Collins.\n\nI am extremely pleased and looking forward to returning to Zimbabwe.\n\nThe new government in the UK is about developing a new approach to the continent of Africa, where we actually launched a consultation last year, a consultation on our approach, which was about listening and not talking, focusing on the continents agenda and not only ours.\n\nThe dramatic shift in policy comes at a time Mnangagwa had unsuccessfully been battling to re-engage with Western countries such as America, the UK, Australia and Canada, who have always pointed out his human rights record as a red flag.\n\nIn December 2024, Collins spoke against readmitting Zimbabwe into the Commonwealth, a union of mainly former British colonies. Speaking in the UK Parliaments House of Lords, he said his Africa office did not support Zimbabwes readmission after an assessment by the Commonwealth Secretariat. He proposed further steps on democracy, government and respect for human rights.\n\nSpeaking to journalists after meeting Mnangagwa on Wednesday, Collins said their approach was not a one size fits all.\n\nHe added: That win-win situation is something that I think we all want to ensure future prosperity for Zimbabwe and future prosperity for the UK.\n\nAs we move forward, what we are absolutely clear, our approach is not one size fits all, it is about strengthening our bilateral relations. I said to His Excellency that I am very determined to return to Zimbabwe to ensure that we actually deliver what we promise.\n\n",

The company had to send products via Namibia into Zambia as routes through Mozambique were disturbed by the unrest, impacting working capital and profits negatively.\n\nWith strong performance from Agriculture RSA and mining segment, Omnias revenues for the year to the end of March grew 2.7% to R22.82 billion. Mining has emerged as Omnias strongest business from an outdoor projective.\n\nThere is still a strong demand for metals, you know, the metals that drive that transition to cleaner energy, you know, the battery metals, uranium. So, we are positively disposed to the mining market, and we are winning new customers, renewing new customers, explained Gobalsamy.\n\nHeadline earnings per share increased by 1% to 704 cents, while operating profit remained unchanged at R1.7bn despite the inclusion of the Chemicals restructuring costs, along with the impact of severe drought conditions and currency depreciation in Agriculture Rest of Africa.\n\nThe Mining segment delivered an improved operating margin of 12.4% from 12.1%, supported by strong performance from Mining RSA and Mining International, as well as higher throughput and efficiencies.\n\nIn the mining sector, sustained demand for critical minerals supporting the global energy transition, underpinned exploration activity and supported positive fundamentals for the explosives market.\n\nHowever, geopolitical tensions and trade policy uncertainty presented ongoing risks.\n\nThe group had a net cash balance of R1.77bn was down from R2.3bn.\n\nThe board declared a total dividend of 675 cents per share for the year. This comprises an increased ordinary dividend of 400 cents, from 375 cents the prior year, and a special dividend of 275 cents per share, returning R1.1bn to shareholders.\n\nDespite persistent macroeconomic headwinds, Omnia delivered sustained profitability and continued to create long-term value for shareholders. This performance reflects the strength, quality, and growing diversity of our portfolio, underpinned by a sharpened focus on manufacturing efficiency, supply chain resilience, and customer-driven innovation, Gobalsamy said\n\nThe increased ordinary dividend payout, and special dividend declared is a clear signal of our confidence in the sustainability of our earnings and the successful execution of our growth and diversification strategy.\n\nLooking ahead, Omnia said the outlook for its Agriculture segment remained positive, driven by expected improvements in agronomic conditions across key regions such as the proprietary Nutriology model.\n\nOmnia said 2026 will be a significant transition year in which non-core assets and business lines will be sold, capital released and returns improved.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nDISTURBED by the deadly Pit Bull Terrier dogs vicious and fatal attack of a Harare resident recently, legislators want the breed banned in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Pit Bull Terrier, commonly known as Pitbull, is an aggressive type of canine.\n\nMembers of Parliament (MPs) suggested to the Speaker Jacob Mudenda during a Question and Answer session this Wednesday that the dog breed known as Pitbull had become a threat to peoples lives as it is not wired to obey instructions like some of the breeds, hence, it should be banned in the country.\n\nThe call comes barely a fortnight after a man was mauled to death by the terrifying dogs in Bluff Hill, Harare.\n\nZanu PF Goromonzi West MP Biata Beatrice Karimatsenga- Nyamupinga raised concern over the pets-turned-killers.\n\nWhen moving in the bush we fear being killed by wild animals but when we are moving in the residential areas there are dogs such as the Pitbull.\n\nThe Pitbull is killing people. That dog does not listen to instructions from the owner. What is the government policy on the keeping of animals, in particular dogs like the Pitbull?\n\nResponding to the question, Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi, who is also Leader of Government Business in Parliament, said the law, through councils, clearly stated that a dog owner should have a licence.\n\nThat law clearly states the number of dogs which are allowed in each and every household in towns. In other areas there are no dogs which are allowed.\n\nThat is why the individual who kept a Pitbull which killed someone was arrested. The police apprehended him because it was against the law. The Pitbull needs a licence which is different from other types of dogs because it is a very vicious dog, Ziyambi said.\n\nIn her supplementary question, Karimatsenga-Nyamupinga, however, disputed that the licence itself was not enough to stop such deadly attacks seen in the past week.\n\nShe highlighted that the Pitbull loses its memory, hence needs to be outlawed.\n\nYes, the licence can be there but we have that type of dog which loses its memory. What are we trying to say if we are allowing people to keep dogs which lose their memory? What are we trying to say about the lives of people? the MP stated.\n\nZiyambi told Mudenda that her question could only be responded to by the Veterinary Department, adding she should put the question in writing for further investigation from experts.\n\nThe government policy clearly indicates that for someone to keep dogs, they must be given a licence. If we want to go deeper on the types of licence and groups, it really needs to be written down so that we can go and consult the experts.\n\nIt will be easier for each and every individual in this august House and the rest of the country to understand the requirements needed to keep Pitbull dogs, Ziyambi explained.\n\nMudenda ordered the MP to put her question in writing, as it needed further clarification.\n\nChinhoyi MP Leslie Mhangwa added his weight to the conversation.\n\nlf we have somebody who has become a danger to the community, he is put in jail or put somewhere else.\n\nThe Pitbull as a breed has become a danger to the people of Zimbabwe. Is there anything that stops us from banning the breed within the country? I think this is the direction we need to move with.\n\nThe Speaker made a ruling that the question by Karimatsenga-Nyamupinga be put in writing and be dealt with next week.\n\nA Harare man, Samuel Machara was recently killed by Pitbulls owned by Mike Mupinga (40) of Bluff Hill in Harare, who was arrested and charged with culpable homicide.\n\nIn 2022, a Bulawayo man from Selborne suburb was also bitten to death by his own canines.\n\nTwelve countries in Europe, as well as Australia, Canada, some parts of the United States, Ecuador, Malaysia, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, and Venezuela, have enacted some form of breed-specific legislation on Pitbull-type dogs, including American Pit Bull Terriers, ranging from outright bans to restrictions and conditions on ownership.\n\nSeveral states in Australia place restrictions on the breed, including mandatory sterilisation. Pitbulls are banned in the United Kingdom, in the Canadian province of Ontario, and in many locations in the United States.\n\n",

            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nIn Filabusi, the streets are packed with BMW X5s and Land Rover Defenders, modern houses paid for in cash are springing up and whisky is only sold by the bottle in the small towns bars.\n\nThe three-year surge in gold prices, driven to a record this year as US President Donald Trumps trade war bolstered its allure as a safe-haven, is enriching the countrys more than 700,000 informal, or artisanal, miners. They are flocking to gold mining belts and throwing a lifeline to an economy thats been in economic turmoil since the turn of the century.\n\nIn the first five months of this year, those miners almost doubled the metal they delivered to a state refinery from a year earlier to more than 11 tons, swelling the countrys export income. At the current pace of production the country could earn a billion dollars more from gold shipments this year than in 2024.\n\nThe prices have been very favourable to the miners which is something we are so happy about, said Wellington Takavarasha, the president of Zimbabwe Artisanal and Small Scale for Sustainable Mining Council. This year is looking very good. We must capitalize on this rally.\n\nFor the about 4% of people living in Zimbabwe, and their dependents, who are involved in the gold mining its been a vital source of income. Formal employment has withered and millions of citizens have emigrated to South Africa, the UK and other countries in search of economic opportunities. For now, its their only hope and one that depends on the high prices holding.\n\nSo far, theres no sign that the rally will come to an end. The price of the metal has surged 22% since Trumps inauguration and is up by three-fifths since the beginning of last year. It hit a record of $3,432 an ounce on May 6 and Goldman Sachs forecast it will reach $3,700 by year end.\n\nThats pushed Zimbabwes central bank to paying cash for gold deliveries, targeting a record 40 tonnes of purchases this year after it earned $2.5 billion in 2024, a 37% jump from the year earlier. Artisanal producers supplied three-quarters of the metal delivered in April, whereas a few years ago the majority of their output would have been smuggled out of the country.\n\nBrighton Moyo with a newly acquired BMWbought from gold proceedsat a car wash in Filabusi (Zinyange Auntony)\n\nFor artisanal workers like Mxolisi Dube, clad in navy blue work overalls with a miners torch strapped to his head as he walks through Filabusi, the gold price rally has been a boon. The 33-year-old began mining for gold illegally in 2008.\n\nBut now with higher prices and the cooperation of mine owners, who have begun to invite artisanal workers onto their properties to boost production, his earnings have surged.\n\nYou are assured of getting something at the end of the month, said Dube, who has a copper dental filling and a brass chain around his neck. You are protected. If you are not under a company you always have to run away.\n\nMine owners, struggling with dilapidated equipment and a lack of finance, are increasingly urging those operators to swap the pans they used to sift through river sand for gold flecks for picks and shovels to help them extract as much gold ore to process as quickly as possible.\n\nThis means we always have ore available and are milling more, said Meli Nkulumo, plant manager at Macoomber 7 mine, which lies 12 miles west of Filabusi down winding dirt roads. Artisanal miners were invited onto the property two years ago.\n\nMeli Nkulumo, a metallurgist checks a website displaying gold prices at the Macoomber 7 mine (Zinyange Auntony)\n\nAt the mine, workers use Elon Musks Starlink internet service to compare the prices offered by the central bank to global benchmarks. Goldprice.org is their favored website.\n\nHigher gold prices are better for everyone, said Thulani Ndlovu, the acting mine manager. We can also look forward to a raise in salaries.\n\nStill, its backbreaking work thats carried out around the clock. The miners break up rocks underground with picks, shovel it into a loader which is then winched to the surface. During their eight-hour shifts their only sustenance is maheu, a drink made from fermented corn meal.\n\nBut for artisanal miners the price surge has been life-changing and nowhere is that more evident than in Bekezela, a suburb of Filabusi where property owners are busy putting up brick houses ringed by electric fences and equipped with water storage tanks and solar panels. The town council is having to rezone more land for residential and commercial use and at car washes 4x4s queue to have the dust of the surrounding savannah rinsed off.\n\nBar manager Thabo Mpofu says the gold boom has attracted big spenders and he now sells whisky by the bottle. (Zinyange Auntony)\n\nDrinking holes are busy with all sorts of people spending big, Thabo Mpofu, the manager of Next Generation bar, said, adding that he has seen clients buy bottles of Hennessey Cognac and pour them out on the ground as a show of wealth.\n\nIts also curbed crime including invasions of local mines by illegal operators. Theres nothing bad here that happens, said Melusi Nyoni, the manager of Fred and Fernando mines, which are on the outskirts of Filabusi town, He now allows artisanal miners to work in shafts as deep as a kilometer (0.6 miles). There is gold just all over, he said.\n\nMine manager Melusi Nyoni after visiting the underground tunnels (Zinyange Auntony)\n\nStill, with rudimentary equipment and limited safety protocols, digging up the ore is dangerous work.\n\nGold miners at work in an underground tunnel at the Fred & Fernando mines.Photographer: Zinyange Auntony/Bloomberg\n\nInformal miners accounted for 87% of the 186 deaths in Zimbabwean mining accidents, the Chamber of Mines said in its last annual report. As recently as late May, four died at a mine near Chegutu in northern Zimbabwe when a wall of earth collapsed onto them, according to local media reports.\n\nBut as long as the rally lasts, thats little deterrence for artisanal miners who, until recently, were eking out a livingby camping out and panning for gold in remote wild areas for several months.\n\nThe high prices mean in the near future I will also be seen in a car, says Dube, a father of four. I want a Toyota Hilux 44, with a 2.7-litre engine.\n\n",

We stress that the ban should be implemented immediately to prevent further depletion of our natural capital due to unchecked lithium exploitation, which has devastating socio-economic and environmental implications, CNRG stated.\n\nThe organisation further urged the government to address the issue of porous borders, which have allowed some lithium to be smuggled into South Africa and Mozambique without any benefit to Zimbabwe\n\nZimbabwes lithium wealth risks being squandered, as unchecked exports, weak regulation, and opaque deals undermine its potential for industrial transformation.\n\nAlready, allegations of lithium smuggling across porous borders into South Africa and Mozambique raise concerns regarding corruption and illicit mineral and financial flows.\n\nUnverified reports indicate that up to 3,000 tons of lithium ore leave the country dailya staggering total of 1.62 million tons over the past 18 monthswith minimal accountability, little benefit to the state, and no protection for affected communities.\n\nDuring a post-cabinet media briefing in Harare yesterday, Mines Minister Winston Chitando said the government will ban the exportation of lithium ore as part of an effort to promote value addition and ensure that the country comprehensively benefits from its natural resources.\n\nCabinet reaffirmed the ban on the export of chrome ores and stressed the need to develop the ferrochrome industry locally. The Ministry of Mines and Mining Development will strengthen the implementation of the use it or lose it principle, and holders of all unutilised mining titles, particularly chrome, are requested to take note of the Governments position, Chitando said.\n\nHe added that Bikita Minerals and Arcadia Lithium are in the process of establishing lithium sulphate value addition facilities to beneficiate locally produced lithium ores. From January 2027 onwards, the export of lithium concentrate will no longer be permitted.\n\nLithium plays a crucial role in the clean energy transition due to its essential function in energy storage. It is a key component in lithium-ion batteries, which power electric vehicles (EVs) and facilitate large-scale energy storage systems for renewable energy sources.\n\n",
