This was after his company, TN Asset Management, underwrote a rights issue for the company late last year.\n\nResponding on his X (formerly Twitter) recently, Nyambirai clarified that while he cannot speak on behalf of Steward Bank or EcoCash Holdings, he vowed to push for an official disclosure via the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE).\n\nA legal notice on the change of name of Steward Bank Limited has generated a lot of interest here on X.\n\nWe shall seek the authority of the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange to publish an update on the name changes. The update shall seek to answer some of the questions that have been raised, he said.\n\nA name looked at in the abstract might be meaningless. But the way the owner carries the name gives it value. Many Zimbabwean bank names lack obvious meanings, yet their strength lies in how they deliver on their promises.\n\nThe present generation would have demanded that Henry Wells and William Fargo change names first, before they named their banks, Wells Fargo after themselves, he said.\n\nThe rebranding process, he noted, will follow stringent corporate governance procedures, including shareholder consultations.\n\nMarket watchers believe that Nyambirais challenge remains convincing the public that the new identity will uphold or surpass the banks legacy.\n\n",

The mismanagement by the Dynamos executive led by Bernard Marriot, his relatives, and the so-called NEC has reached a boiling point, said Machovo.\n\nDynamos continue to sink deeper, currently occupying the relegation zone, separated by only two points from Kwekwe United, who sit at the basement of the table.\n\nDeMbare have managed just one win in 13 matches, scoring only two goalsa record that has sparked fury among supporters.\n\nThe struggles have been attributed to poor recruitment and the general welfare of players at the club.\n\nMachovo accused Dynamos leadership of running the club with an amateurish, and an outdated approach.\n\nWe can no longer remain silent. Our key concerns is the tuck shop mentality, outdated approach and sponsorship failure, said Machovo.\n\n",

These will be at the intersection of Simon Mazorodze and Willowvale Roads, as well as Simon Mazorodze and Remembrance Drive.\n\nMnangagwa also said four more interchanges will be built at busy road points across Harare, including Mabvuku Junction, several spots along Harare Drive, and at major traffic circles like Westgate and Kuwadzana.\n\nAdditionally, four interchanges will also be constructed at the Mabvuku Junction; Harare Drive/Mutare Road; Harare Drive/Liberation Legacy Way; Nemakonde Way/Harare Drive; Sam Nujoma/Harare Drive; Westgate Traffic Circle; Kuwadzana Traffic Circle and Churchill/Liberation Way, Mnangagwa said.\n\nHe also added that nine junctions along Harare and Bulawayo Airport Roads will also be upgraded, and smart traffic systems will be used to improve traffic flow and road discipline.\n\nNine junctions shall be updated as part of the J. M. Nkomo Road (RGM International Airport Road) upgrade to grade separation structures.\n\nIn addition, smart traffic management systems are now also in place and will be deployed towards optimising traffic flow through intelligent systems. The roll out of these systems must be publicised and see greater discipline on our roads.Although the long-delayed project is now complete, its high cost reported at US$88 million has sparked public and parliamentary debate, with calls for an audit to clarify how the funds were used, as many accuse the government of massive looting.\n\n",
