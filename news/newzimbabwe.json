Its the start of a new chapter.\n\nThe bridge has a high-speed glass elevator that can send visitors to a coffee spot 2,600 feet above the river. Visitors can also try bungee jumping or a 1,900-foot-high glass walkway.\n\nThe province of Guizhou, which is home to about 40 million people, has undergone an infrastructure campaign in recent decades as part of theChinese governments war on poverty. It now has more than 32,000 bridges that are either completed or under construction, compared with about 2,900 in the 1980s.\n\nGuizhou is also home to what is now the worlds second-highest bridge, Duge Bridge, which opened in 2016.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has overturned a ruling that had awarded damages to six Rusape councillors who sued the town council for malicious prosecution, finding that the council never instigated their arrest and that their claims for legal fees and lost business were unsupported.\n\nJustices Sijabuliso Siziba and Isaac Muzenda allowed Rusape Town Councils appeal and dismissed the councillors claims, which had each been pegged at US$7,500.\n\nThe court a quo erred in finding the appellant liable for the delict of malicious prosecution, ruled Justice Siziba. There was no evidence that the council, as a legal persona, took a resolution to set the law in motion against the respondents. Without such resolution, the council cannot be said to have instigated prosecution.\n\nThe case stemmed from a 2020 tender row over the provision of legal services. The six councillors Lyton Sithole, Elizabeth Chidza, Joseph Nyamupera, Ndabaningi Mataga, Preference Chigwede and Peter Kwesha were arrested and charged by the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) with criminal abuse of duty after the tender was cancelled.\n\nHowever, at their criminal trial, State witnesses, including then Acting Town Secretary Fansen Shuwa, cleared them of wrongdoing, testifying that they had not been part of the committee handling the tender. The councillors were acquitted at the close of the States case.\n\nIn 2023, the six sued the council for malicious prosecution, demanding US$40,000 collectively in damages. The magistrates court later awarded them each US$5,500 for legal fees and US$2,000 for lost business opportunities.\n\nThe High Court said those awards had no evidentiary basis.\n\nMalicious prosecution requires more than merely reporting a case to the police, Justice Siziba said. A party can only be found liable if it acted in a manner that tended to overbear on the police to institute proceedings which they would not otherwise commence. That was not the case here.\n\nThe court noted that ZACC had independently approached town officials and obtained statements while the councillors were away, with no council resolution authorising or directing such action.\n\nOn the issue of damages, the judges stressed that special damages must be strictly proven. No receipts were produced to show that any payment was made to lawyers, Justice Siziba wrote. It was a misdirection for the trial court to rely on the Law Society tariff in the absence of proof of actual payment.\n\nThe judges also dismissed the claims for lost business opportunities as unsubstantiated.\n\nThe councillors victory in the lower court has now been nullified. Rusape Town Council will not be liable for any damages.\n\nIn the result, we found merit in the appeal by the appellant and thereby upheld the appeal, the judgment concluded.\n\n",

Tyla kept her focus on the situation, later checking in with concertgoers who were nearby to make sure everything was under control\n\nWhen they signalled that all was well, she smiled warmly before asking the crowd whether she should continue where she left off or restart the song. The question led to the audience erupting in excitement, choosing the restart option.\n\nThe popiano star showed care for her fans in the middle of what was already a vibrant night of performances.\n\nLater in the night, Tyla brought a different kind of energy when she performed Mr Media, a song where she directly responds to her critics.\n\nThe song is one of her sassiest, with lyrics that carry a sharp none of your concern message, shutting down outside noise.\n\nAt one point, she sings: Remember when I used to fight with words? Really, I should be worse, I should be meaner What I? None of your concern.\n\nIts essentially a mic drop with Tyla reminding everyone that she can clap back, but often chooses not to.\n\nThat context made it all the more fitting when, mid-performance, she told the Global Citizen audience she is not sorry.\n\nThe statement comes after Nigerian star Tiwa Savageweighed in on Tylas ongoing coloured identity controversyduring an interview on The Breakfast Club, causing online outrage.\n\nSavage said she understood why the term is offensive in America, but also expressed sympathy for Tyla.\n\nI would get why that would be such a huge thing here, because of the history behind that name, she said. I think I felt for her a little bit because she is young and I do not think she means to come across like that.\n\nSavage went further by apologising on Tylas behalf, saying, So if that was not communicated, I would like to say on behalf of her, we apologise. We did not mean it, forgive us. I do not think it came from a bad place.\n\nShakira and Cardi B were among the stars who lit up the 2025 Global Citizen festival, joined by Ayra Starr and Mariah the Scientist.\n\nThis years festival, which took place on September 27, was hosted once again by Hugh Jackman, placing a strong emphasis on African voices and global issues.\n\nThe event is part of the Global Citizen movement, which blends music and activism to fight poverty, inequality, and climate change.\n\nOne of the key initiatives this year focused on bringing energy access to one million people across Africa.\n\n",

            "content": "By James Muonwa\n\nCARBON Green Investments (CGI) has expressed commitment to implement its suspended Kariba REDD+ Project on forests conservation and community support in Zimbabwe.\n\nThis position follows endorsement by Verra, which is the global carbon credits regulatory body, acknowledging that the status of retired Kariba REDD+ credits will not change, and remain valid in their registry, meaning previously purchased credits also stay valid notwithstanding the baseline reassessment.\n\nThe carbon project owner says it welcomes Verras report, which it will scrutinise together with officials from the Government of Zimbabwe.\n\nCGI thanks Verra for providing its update and results from their review of the Kariba REDD+ Project, as outlined in their September 23, 2025, letter and public statement, said GCI in a statement.\n\nIn response, CGI, in collaboration with the Government of Zimbabwe, will carefully review Verras outcome. To ensure a thorough, true, and accurate outcome, CGI has concluded independent third-party assessments of the carbon accounting and related matters, using all up-to-date data, scientific findings and appropriate methodologies. From this evaluation, CGI will partner with the new registry to address and mitigate any historical discrepancies in credit issuance, prioritising transparency and the long-term sustainability of the project.\n\nWe value Verras role in trying to advance environmental integrity and looks forward to constructive dialogue as we move forward.\n\nCGI remains committed to the Kariba REDD+ Projects mission of forest conservation and community support in Zimbabwe. We are grateful for Verras input and are committed to continue working towards resolutions that uphold the highest standards, the company said.\n\nAmidst the positive outlook, GCI issued a weeks ultimatum demanding from Verra the baseline assessment report and data sources for the Kariba REDD+ Project review.\n\nWhile we appreciate the update on the carbon accounting and quality control processes, we are concerned by the lack of accompanying detail regards the basis for the reported findings, wrote CGI in a note dated September 25, 2025.\n\nAs the project proponent, we are committed to engaging constructively and transparently with all stakeholders involved, the company further said, before demanding the baseline reassessment report and data sources.\n\nFurther, GCI requested a freeze on the compensation process and interfering with its clients without the companys prior consent.\n\nThe ultimatum comes in the wake of concerns by Verra that there was over-crediting of carbons for the Kariba REDD+ Project, which some environmental analysts have questioned.\n\nIn an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Phillip Mutemachani said Verra was shooting itself in the foot by stating alleged over-crediting Kariba REDD+ Project carbon credits.\n\nMeanwhile, carbon asset developer, South Pole, has also added its voice on the saga of Verras Section 6 review into the Kariba REDD+ Project.\n\nAlthough South Pole has ceased all involvement with both project and the project owner since 2023, we have cooperated with Verra, a global carbon standard body, through every step of this review, which we see as an important process to give everyone, including South Pole and its various stakeholders, more clarity and guidance on the projects status and future.\n\nThe integrity and robustness of the buffer pool mechanism remain intact to manage any potential emissions reversals in the project.\n\nIn its past role as carbon asset developer, South Pole has consistently applied Verras VM0009 methodology as it pertains to carbon accounting, South Pole noted in a statement.\n\nIn normal circumstances under Verras VM009 methodology, any discrepancy between projected and actual deforestation (i.e. after a periodic assessment of the baseline as outlined in the methodology itself), would be corrected in subsequent verification periods.\n\nHowever, given the unprecedented situation of the project withdrawing from the Verra Registry, there are no subsequent monitoring periods where such compensation could occur. Verras update confirms that the carbon standard body is now taking proactive, corrective steps to balance credit issuances in lieu of the correction that would have otherwise been applicable as per the in-built true-up mechanism in VM0009.\n\nAlongside South Poles wider cooperation as part of the review, South Pole has proactively requested that Verra cancel the 2.5 million verified Kariba REDD+ credits South Pole holds to help address the discrepancies in issued credits and uphold the environmental integrity of the project.\n\nThis contribution builds on South Poles concerted efforts over the last two years to undergo a comprehensive transformation, which included a full review and strengthening of the companys quality, risk, and compliance protocols. The company introduced stricter KYC and partner diligence processes to ensure project partners align with our ethical and compliance standards.\n\nAs a carbon asset developer hired by the project owner, South Poles past responsibility was to ensure that Verras VM0009 methodology was being consistently applied as it pertains to the carbon accounting of the project, in order to receive verified carbon credits.\n\nIn addition, it managed the sale of carbon credits to the market in order to secure funding for the projects operations on the ground, but responsibility for operating the project on the ground  including engagement with and distribution of funds to local communities and initiatives  has been with CGIs local partner Carbon Green Africa (CGA).\n\n",
