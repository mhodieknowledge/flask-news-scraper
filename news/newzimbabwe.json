He was not dropped but injured on Monday, said a source from within the entourage.\n\nThose who noticed, on Monday he sat out most of the training because of a knock he got last Friday (when Zimbabwe played Benin in Ivory Coast).\n\nSpeaking after another, slim 1-0 loss Nees fell short of begging for peace and unity, saying the matter had been rested.\n\nI appeal to everybody to stick together, be a little bit humble. We had incidents here and I hope they are all sorted out, said Nees.\n\nWe will not benefit; we all need positive energy. We wanted to break that with a result to get that positive mood. Definitely we have too much noise, there is no doubt about thatwe have to stop that on various platforms.\n\nSocial media has been ablaze since the incident, with fans unevenly divided between Kadewere and Mangunda.\n\nKadewere, despite a dip in form, has found favour and been saluted for standing up for himself while Mangunda is being accused of being toxic towards followers of her Facebook page.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) has warned that while the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwes (RBZ) tight Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) has helped ease inflationary pressures, it has also significantly dampened demand.\n\nThe RBZ has maintained a restrictive monetary policy to stabilise prices, the exchange rate, and the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency. Current measures include a high policy rate of 35%, a statutory reserve requirement of 15% for savings and time deposits, and 30% for demand and call deposits.\n\nThe policy framework is designed to support the ZiG, which was introduced to restore confidence and stability in the economy. The central bank has been working to maintain the currencys stability against the US dollar.\n\nIn its latest inflation tracker, CZI noted that while the fall in inflation confirms the effectiveness of the current monetary stance in stabilising prices, the downside has been a steep decline in aggregate demand.\n\nWhile tight liquidity is helping stabilise prices, it also has negative implications on demand and hence business output and growth. Therefore, in the long term, monetary policy has to ease tight liquidity conditions as stability becomes sustainable, the industry grouping said.\n\nCZI said keeping inflation below 1% enhances price stability and goes a long way in broadening the use of ZiG beyond a transaction currency, while acknowledging that businesses that previously preferred to trade in USD transactions only are beginning to slowly encourage ZiG payments to help them settle some of their monthly obligations.\n\nThe industry grouping said the high annual inflation rate of 93,8% is still reflective of the September 2024 devaluation of ZiG, hence will only ease in October, provided there is no other shock in the inflation drivers to cause high month-on-month inflation.\n\nIn comparison, the US$ prices remained the same between July and August 2025 as the main driver of USD inflation (S.I. 81A of 2024) was repelled in early 2025. Some of the possible signals to be derived from the stable USD prices include greater predictability in input and output costs for businesses that largely operate in US$.\n\nThe industry grouping warned that the gap between the official and parallel market rates could motivate traders to abandon the formal market.\n\n",

This will only deepen poverty, running contrary to the SDGs, particularly the goal of eradicating poverty, as well as the objectives of NDS1, which seeks to reduce the cost of doing business, Tsvangirayi said.\n\nNorton MP Richard Tsvangirayi\n\nHe also urged ZIMRA to pursue incentive-based strategies to boost compliance instead of punitive measures that threaten livelihoods.\n\nWhile the intention may be to encourage companies to register, formalise their operations, and increase government revenue, alternative strategies must be pursued.\n\nThese strategies should focus on incentivising compliance rather than relying on punitive measures that exacerbate the economic hardships already faced by ordinary citizens. In this regard, ZIMRA must urgently revise these figures downwards to ensure fairness and protect livelihoods.\n\n",

On arrival, they discovered the mans body with multiple injuries, believed to have been inflicted with stones and bottles. Paramedics declared him dead at the scene.\n\nColonel Malesela Ledwaba, the provincial police spokesperson, confirmed that the motive for the killing is still under investigation and appealed for the publics help.\n\nWe are treating this as a serious case of mob justice and are appealing to community members with any information to come forward, said Ledwaba.\n\nThe circumstances around the mans death are still unknown, and we urge anyone who can assist in tracing his next of kin or can provide information that leads to the arrest of the suspects to contact the police immediately.\n\nAnyone with information is urged to contact Detective Sergeant Mmatlou Nkoana at 082 716 8075, the Crime Stop number 08600 10111, the nearest police station, or use the My SAPS App, he said.\n\nIn another case,a 34-year-old woman is expected to appear before the Malamulele Magistrates Court on Tuesday, following her arrest in connection with a mob-justice incident at Mphakati village under the Saselamani policing area.\n\nColonel Ledwaba said the horrific murder incident occurred on Sunday morning.\n\nPolice were conducting patrol duties when they were informed about members of the community who were busy assaulting a male victim at the village. They reacted swiftly and rushed to the vicinity and found a male victim lying in the middle of the road with severe injuries on his body, said Ledwaba.\n\nEmergency medical services were summoned, and he was declared dead on arrival at the scene.\n\nPreliminary investigations revealed that the deceased was forcefully dragged from his residence by a mob who accused him of stealing a laptop from a nearby house, said Ledwaba.\n\nPolice said the arrested woman was positively identified as one of the participants in the brutal attack. Several other suspects are still at large.\n\njonisayi.maromo@iol.co.za\n\n",

The country is a land of wild beauty and rich history. Think rocky granite outcrops rising above golden plains, acacia trees swaying under endless skies, and ancient ruins that whisper stories of the past.\n\nAt Great Zimbabwe, those iconic stone walls still stand strong, a reminder of centuries of civilisation.\n\nOver at Victoria Falls, the mighty Zambezi crashes down so hard it throws up mist that often catches the sun in fleeting rainbows.. And if youre after something calmer, the Eastern Highlands bring misty mountains, winding trails, and a kind of peace you didnt know you needed.\n\nWhy its on the radar: Zimbabwes cities are drawing fresh interest: flight searches to Bulawayo have jumped more than 80% on Kayak, while Harare has seen a 56% rise for summer travel this year.\n\nMorocco comes in 6th on the list, making it the second African country to feature. The country offers a blend of desert magic, mountain drama, and vibrant city life. Out in the Sahara, youve got endless red dunes under silent skies.\n\nThe Atlas Mountains rise tall with snowy peaks, and down in the valleys, olive and argan groves scatter the hills. In Fez, the medina is a maze of narrow alleys, tiled courtyards, and the unforgettable smell of leather dyeing.\n\nMarrakech is a whole vibelantern-lit rooftops, busy souks, metalworkers hammering away, and sunset views over minarets. By the coast, Essaouira serves up salty sea winds and seagulls circling its blue-shuttered houses. And for the dreamiest scene of all, Chefchaouens blue-painted streets wind up toward the Rif Mountains.\n\nEarlier this year, Morocco emerged as Africas most visited destination, attracting17.4 million visitors in 2024, according to its Ministry of Tourism.\n\nWhy its on the radar: Marrakech stands out as one of the best-value long-haul destinations with flight prices down 5% compared to summer last year on Kayak.\n\n",
