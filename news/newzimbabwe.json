            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nFORMER Finance Minister Tendai Biti has slammed University of Zimbabwe (UZ) Vice Chancellor Paul Mapfumos decision to dismiss striking lecturers and suspend student activists supporting the job action.\n\nHe described sanctions against the striking tutors and students union leaders as failure from an arrogant and incompetent leader.A few days back, six students who are members of the Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) were suspended for holding a demonstration in May in support of their striking lecturers, who have been on an ongoing industrial action since April 16.Two weeks earlier, the UZ administration fired four leaders of the ongoing lecturers strike for using the great hall without approval from authorities, a dismissal that they felt was a way to stop the strike.The suspension of student activists and the dismissal of leaders of the Association of University Teachers UZ is another blatant example of the failure and high-handedness of the vacuous, incompetent leadership of the UZ.Prof Mapfumo is an arrogant incompetent Vice Chancellor who mirrors the glaring ignorance and fascism of those he serves.Universities are citadels of the highest forms of cerebral engagement. They cannot be reduced to rag tag sub committees of a corrupt kleptocratic ruling party taken over by a greedy illiterate parasitic elite, Biti said.The lecturers are demanding a salary increase to at least US$2,250 from their current US$250 as well as improved working conditions.Meanwhile, Gift Ostallos Siziba, the former Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) Member of Parliament for Pelandaba Tshabala constituency, called for an immediate reinstatement of six suspended students and demanded justice for lecturers facing hardship and unpaid salaries.We stand in solidarity with ZINASU and join the call for justice for students and lecturers who have endured months of hardship, including unpaid salaries.We will not stand idly by as the future of our youth and the integrity of our academic institutions are compromised, Siziba said.\n\nHe described sanctions against the striking tutors and students union leaders as failure from an arrogant and incompetent leader.\n\nA few days back, six students who are members of the Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) were suspended for holding a demonstration in May in support of their striking lecturers, who have been on an ongoing industrial action since April 16.Two weeks earlier, the UZ administration fired four leaders of the ongoing lecturers strike for using the great hall without approval from authorities, a dismissal that they felt was a way to stop the strike.The suspension of student activists and the dismissal of leaders of the Association of University Teachers UZ is another blatant example of the failure and high-handedness of the vacuous, incompetent leadership of the UZ.Prof Mapfumo is an arrogant incompetent Vice Chancellor who mirrors the glaring ignorance and fascism of those he serves.Universities are citadels of the highest forms of cerebral engagement.

Women in the lowest wealth quintile have significantly more children (5.5) compared to those in the highest quintile (2.6). Women in the lowest wealth quintile have their first birth, on average, three years earlier (19.0 years) than women in the highest quintile (21.9 years), the study says.These findings mirror the situation in Zimbabwe where couples, especially in urban areas are reducing the sizes of their families.Total Fertility Rate (TFR)  the average number of children a woman would have by the end of her childbearing years if she bore children at the current age-specific fertility rates  dropped 4.3 children per woman in 1994 to 3.8 in 2005-06. Since then, it has remained largely stable, currently standing at 3.9 in the 2023-24 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey.On average, a woman in Zimbabwe will have about four children in her lifetime (TRF 3.9). When disaggregated by place of birth women in rural areas (about 5 children per woman  TFT 4,6 tend to have more children than those in urban areas (about 3 children per woman  TFR 3.1). Women in urban areas begin childbearing 2 years later, on average, than rural women (21.1 versus 19.4 years).Even if women, especially those in the workplace, desire to have more children childcare responsibilities often makes it difficult for them to pursue career advancement, maintain full-time employment or engage in professional development opportunities. This in part explains why women in the highest wealth quintile have fewer children.In his keynote address to mark the World Population Day, which coincided with the reports launch, Health and Child Care Minister, Dr Douglas Mombeshora affirmed the governments stance on upholding reproductive rights.The Government of Zimbabwe upholds reproductive rights, empowering individuals to choose the number, timing, and spacing of children they want to have, free from coercion.Fertility rates are a key driver of Zimbabwes continued population growth and contribute significantly to its youthful demographic structure. We will continue to support policies to ensure we prevent low birth rates, he said.UK Development Director and Deputy Head of Mission Dr. Jo Abbot said the UK is proud to stand with Zimbabwe and UNFPA in championing reproductive rights and choices.Vast numbers of people are unable to create the families they want, said Dr. Natalia Kanem, Executive Director of UNFPA.The issue is lack of choice, not desire, with major consequences for individuals and societies.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA SOCIAL justice activist, Dr Believe Guta, has petitioned Parliament of Zimbabwe to amend the Maintenance Act, insisting there should be mandatory confirmation of paternity before criminal sanctions can be imposed on men presumed to be fathers of children seeking child support.\n\nIn a petition submitted to the Speaker of Parliament, Jacob Mudenda under Section 149 of the Constitution, Guta noted glaring shortcomings in the current Maintenance Act (Chapter 5:09), particularly Section 23.The provision currently allows for the imprisonment of individuals, who default on maintenance payments, even in cases where biological paternity has not been scientifically or legally confirmed.Guta, who is based in Kadoma, posited that

            "content": "By Tapiwa Svondo\n\nRUTENDO Maregere, widely known in the music world as Frya, is a talented Zimbabwean singer based in South Africa making waves globally.\n\nMany people worldwide have heard her voice without even knowing it, she sang the theme song for the popular Netflix show, Blood & Water, a song she created with Mr Kamera, real name Tatenda Kamera, and also a Zimbabwean music producer based in South Africa.\n\nDespite her international success, Frya holds a special dream that highlights her deep connection to her roots. She revealed in an interview with NewZimbabwe.com that she wants to collaborate with famous Zimbabwean gospel group, Vabati VaJehova.\n\nThe one Zimbabwean collaboration left that I would really love would be with Vabati VaJehova. I have been a huge fan since I was a kid in primary school, no one around me ever understood the correlation but their music soothes my soul and their sound scape is so spiritual and pure. I listen to their songs every single day (I kid you not), Frya shares, sounding excited.\n\nOne day I know Im going to have the privilege of working with them and Im probably going to weep when I meet them because Im such a huge fan and l have a lot of love and respect for how they have remained authentic through generations, said Frya.\n\nThis shows that even though shes known for modern Zim dancehall hits with stars like Winky D and Nutty O, her faith and heritage are very important to her.\n\nHer path to stardom began when a casual Instagram video of her singing an Adele cover went viral, catching the eye of a South African TV producer. This led to her first official music credit: the title track for the show Side Dish.\n\nAfter the Kure remix in 2019, Frya made the big decision in 2020 to focus on music full-time, which led to her music being featured in other shows like The River, Lockdown, and Glamorous Girls.\n\nHow did South Africa help Fryas music career but still keeping Zimbabwe at heart?\n\nSouth Africa is a melting pot of a lot of beautiful African sounds, so being exposed to artists from different walks of life who express themselves differently inspired me to do the same.\n\nIn terms of my Zimbabwean roots that goes without saying, its literally in my DNA and through every single project I have incorporated my culture through the producers Ive worked with, the drums and instruments, the Shona lyrics in my music and the collaborations lve done with other Zimbabwean artists, said Frya.The advantages of working across the borders and being able to work in both Zimbabwe and South AfricaThe advantages I think involve casting my net wide, operating across two musical landscapes exposed my music to a wider audience which is good because music has become globalised so its important to adapt. More exposure means a higher probability of more opportunities as well. I dont really look at the disadvantages / challenges.I get to do what I love everyday and live off of it and that in itself is a huge blessing. The South African people and the industry have embraced me and Im truly thankful. There is opportunity all around us especially as creatives and even though everyone is fighting to be heard and recognised l have always chosen to go through life with the perspective of focusing on my focus, the good and pouring my energy into creating art that is authentic to me, explained Frya.Whats next for Frya and her aspirations for her music in the next few years?Global exposure, Im very excited for whats to come, there are a lot of international collaborations coming with artists, creatives and brands. I love my people and I appreciate how theyve rallied for me. The aim is to keep working hard, raising the flag and expressing myself authentically through good music. God will handle the rest.Fryas message for aspiring Zimbabwean artists, especially those who might be considering pursuing their careers from abroadIm still figuring a lot out myself but what I can say is if music is truly your calling then follow your dreams. Music is not an easy industry it requires purity, tenacity and perseverance. Work hard to perfect your craft to the best of your ability and always take the stairs, nothing worth having comes easy and nothing that comes easy lasts and anyone that tells you any different is lying to you, said Frya.\n\nIn terms of my Zimbabwean roots that goes without saying, its literally in my DNA and through every single project I have incorporated my culture through the producers Ive worked with, the drums and instruments, the Shona lyrics in my music and the collaborations lve done with other Zimbabwean artists, said Frya.\n\nThe advantages of working across the borders and being able to work in both Zimbabwe and South Africa\n\nThe advantages I think involve casting my net wide, operating across two musical landscapes exposed my music to a wider audience which is good because music has become globalised so its important to adapt.
