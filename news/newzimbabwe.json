            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nPRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa has claimed a shared history with the late former Zambian President Edgar Lungu, asserting they were contemporaries at law school.\n\nSpeaking at the Zambian Embassy on Thursday, where he signed the Book of Condolences following Lungus passing, Mnangagwa insisted on a connection stretching back to his student days.\n\nWe were students together at law school. There is a lot of history between me and him and several other Zambians, I did my education in Zambia, of course he was junior, Mnangagwa stated.\n\nHowever, this assertion has been met with scepticism, with critics quick to point to what they perceive as a series of legal missteps made by the President since assuming office in November 2017.\n\nThese alleged blunders have fuelled doubts about the extent of Mnangagwas legal knowledge and background.\n\nExamples cited include early constitutional gaffes, such as ministerial appointments made outside the bounds of Parliament. The public was obliged to remind him of his overreach, forcing him to rescind his decisions.\n\nFurther scrutiny arose when, during the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, in 2018, Mnangagwa appeared to announce the 2018 elections for May, a date predating the constitutional earliest possible polling day of July 23, 2018.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, shortly after taking office, Mnangagwa issued an ultimatum to those accused of externalising US dollars and assets, demanding they return the loot or face prosecution. This was despite the absence of any Zimbabwean law criminalising such activity at the time, a move widely interpreted as a significant oversight.\n\nThese early missteps have left many questioning the Presidents legal prowess.\n\nDespite the Presidents assertion, critics remain unconvinced. They point to a lack of tangible evidence, noting the absence of photographs or verifiable accounts from alleged classmates to support the claim of a shared legal education.\n\nThe claim, they argue, rests solely on Mnangagwas oral tradition.\n\nDespite the controversy, Mnangagwa further described Lungu as a leader of foresight in terms of development and said his passing represented a significant loss not only for Zambia but for the region as a whole.\n\nWe have lost one of our illustrious leaders he was committed not only to Zambia but to the rest of the region he was one of us he was a man who had foresight in terms of development and collaboration between several countries, he said.\n\nLungu lost the Zambian elections to Hakainde Hichilema in August 2021.\n\nHe has since reportedly enjoyed a close relationship with Zanu PF, with some suggesting Mnangagwas party was funding a potential comeback bid in Zambias 2026 elections, a claim both parties vehemently denied.\n\n",

This partnership with the Parliament of Zimbabwe is a natural and necessary evolution of our mission. It recognizes that governance is not the responsibility of government aloneit is a collective effort that must be enriched by the voices of civil society, communities, and the church, he said.\n\nThe clergyman underscored that the new chapter in the collective journey will not only reinforce democratic processes but also foster trust between the people and their elected representativesa trust he described as essential for peace, development, and national cohesion.\n\nHonourable Speaker, allow me to express our profound gratitude to your office, and to all those who have worked tirelessly to bring this MoU to life. As we sign this MoU, let it be a pledge to pursue the common good; and a covenant to work hand in hand for the betterment of every Zimbabwean, especially the most vulnerable, added Bwanali.\n\nThe partnership is set to enhance the legislators understanding of Bills presented to Parliament to ensure informed and meaningful contributions to law-making while improving the quality of parliamentary debates by promoting issue-based, constructive, and well-informed dialogue.\n\nIt will also facilitate engagement between legislators and marginalised communities, ensuring that policy and legislative processes reflect the voices and needs of all citizens.\n\n",

The amount is based on the refuse collection and street cleaning service rendered by the contractor, it continues.\n\nFurther adding to the sense of unease is the apparent erosion of the CoHs control over waste management, a function ostensibly outsourced but not supervised.\n\nFormer Mt Pleasant MP Fadzayi Mahere has also weighed in, questioning the logic behind the tax exemption.\n\nWhy does the agreement stipulate that Geo Pomona will pay 0% tax yet it is being paid so handsomely through public funds? What is the legal basis of this irrational tax exemption?, she wrote on X (formerly Twitter) on Friday.\n\nWhile Geo Pomona is ostensibly led by Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Delish Nguwaya, persistent reports suggest he is merely a figurehead. Whispers persist that the real power brokers are members of the First Family, specifically Sean Mnangagwa, son of President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nThe Geo Pomona deal appears to have usurped the CoHs legal responsibility for refuse collection and street cleaning in the capital.\n\nHarare Mayor Jacob Mafume was unavailable for comment, citing his absence from the country. CoH spokesman Stanley Gama also directed inquiries to Mafume.\n\nIntriguingly, President Mnangagwa recently showered praise on Mafume, describing him as a cooperative and helpful mayor. This endorsement is somewhat unusual, given that Mafume is a member of the opposition. Critics suggest the praise is part of the complex political landscape surrounding the Geo Pomona deal.\n\n",

Its Executive Chairman and CEO, Delish Nguwaya, is a regular attendee at state functions and is known to be a close associate of President Emmerson Mnangagwas son, Sean Mnangagwa.\n\nNguwaya was previously charged with corruption over Covid-19 procurement contracts involving his company, Drax International, in 2020, but was acquitted by court in September 2023.\n\nThey have no legal mandate to independently take over public waste management under our law, Mahere posted on her X account on Wednesday.\n\nMahere, a constitutional lawyer, argued that Geo Pomona should not impose itself on residents, as their obligations lie with the CoH, not individual households.\n\nFormer Mt Pleasant MP Fadzayi Mahere\n\nThey are not a statutory body. At best, if they have a contract with City of Harare, they are the citys agent. This means that the City of Harare is the principal and public facing party with Geo Pomona working under them as an agent. They cannot do their business independently of the city and force themselves onto people with whom they have no legal relationship.\n\nMahere questioned Geo Pomonas authority to bill residents directly, stating that the company lacks the legal basis to do so.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, they have no right to bill or otherwise engage residents directly absent a valid agreement with individual residents to do so. Only the City of Harare can do that in line with its powers as a local authority under Zimbabwes local government laws, she said.\n\nGeo Pomona is set to receive over US$162 million from the CoH over five years, with ratepayers ultimately footing the bill.\n\nThe 30-year agreement stipulated that Harare must deliver 550 tonnes of waste, or a minimum of 200,750 tonnes per year, resulting in US$8.03 million for the company in the first year.\n\nThis has opened doors for Geo Pomona to potentially take control of the entire waste management process, from street sweeping and refuse collection to waste disposal thereby billing residents directly.\n\n",
