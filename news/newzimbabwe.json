            "content": "BBC\n\nRwanda says it is pulling out of a central African regional bloc after a diplomatic row over its involvement in the conflict in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThe country was supposed to take up the chairman role of the Economic Community of Central African States (Eccas), which rotates between its 11 members.\n\nBut it was prevented from doing so at a meeting on Saturday in Equatorial Guinea.\n\nAnnouncing its decision to leave Eccas, Rwanda said its right to take up the chairmanship was deliberately ignored in order to impose the DRCs diktat.\n\nAs a result, it saw no justification for remaining in an organisation whose current functioning runs counter to its founding principles and intended purpose.\n\nThe row comes as efforts to end the fighting in eastern DR Congo continue. Following US mediation, Rwanda and DR Congo are working on a draft peace plan that is expected to be signed later this month.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Congolese presidency, the Eccas leaders at the summit acknowledged the aggression against the Democratic Republic of Congo by Rwanda and ordered the aggressor country to withdraw its troops from Congolese soil.\n\nIt added that until the dispute was resolved, it was decided that Equatorial Guinea would remain in the chairman role to the detriment of Rwanda.\n\nIn comments directed at Rwanda, Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said that one cannot continually and voluntarily violate the principles that underpin our regional institutions and claim to want to preside over them.\n\nHe added that the Eccas decision should inspire other regional organisations to adopt a firmer stance against Rwanda.\n\nRwanda has been accused of supporting M23 rebels in the east of DR Congo. The group has made major advances at the beginning of the year, taking the key regional cities of Goma and Bukavu.\n\nDR Congos government, the US and France have identified Rwanda as backing the M23.\n\nLast year, a UN experts report said that up to 4,000 Rwandan troops were fighting alongside the rebels.\n\nBut Rwanda has denied the accusations, saying instead that its troops were deployed along its border to prevent the conflict spilling over into its territory.\n\nRwanda has once before, in 2007, left Eccas, whose mission is to foster co-operation and strengthen regional integration in central Africa. It rejoined several years later.\n\n",

Transporting dogs in vehicles has also been outlawed.Dog ownership has been frowned upon in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, with dogs viewed as unclean by authorities and a legacy of Western cultural influence.But despite efforts to discourage it, dog ownership is rising, particularly among young people, and it is viewed as a form of rebellion against the restrictive Iranian regime.Cities including Isfahan and Kerman have introduced bans in recent days, according to news agency AFP.An official from the western city of Ilam, where a ban was implemented on Sunday, said legal action would be taken against people who violated the new rules, according to local media.However, enforcing restrictions in the past has been patchy, while many dog owners continue to walk their dogs in public in Tehran and other parts of Iran.There is no national law that outrightly bans dog ownership, but prosecutors often issue local restrictions that are enforced by police.Dog walking is a threat to public health, peace and comfort, Abbas Najafi, prosecutor of the western city of Hamedan, told state newspaper Iran.Owners have sometimes been arrested and dogs confiscated for being walked in public.Many have taken to walking their dogs in secluded areas at night or driving them around to evade detection.Politicians in the Islamic regime regard pet ownership as un-Islamic. Many religious scholars view petting dogs or coming into contact with their saliva as najis or ritually impure.Irans supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has previously described dog ownership  other than for the purposes of herding, hunting and security  as reprehensible.In 2021, 75 lawmakers condemned dog ownership as a destructive social problem that could gradually change the Iranian and Islamic way of life.Irans Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance banned advertisements for pets or pet-related products in 2010  and in 2014 there was a drive in Parliament to fine and even flog dog-walkers, though the bill did not pass.Following the recent crackdown, critics argue the police should focus on public safety at a time of growing concern over violent crime, rather than targeting dog owners and restricting personal freedoms.Dog ownership, defying Irans mandatory hijab laws, attending underground parties and drinking alcohol have long been forms of quiet rebellion against Irans theocratic regime.\n\nThe ban  which mirrors a 2019 police order that barred dog walking in the capital, Tehran  has been extended to at least 18 other cities in the past week.

I never thought I would have to face this alone, especially with a child on the way, a teary Madenyika told NewZimbabwe.com, her voice trembling with grief.\n\nHer anguish is compounded by the financial burden of a funeral that is yet to be done.\n\nI dont know how I will manage, she said, her eyes filled with tears.\n\nWe were supposed to build a life together, and now it feels like everything has been taken away from me.\n\nMadenyika hopes that justice will be served with the weight of her loss heavy on her shoulders.\n\nIf the law doesnt take its course, we are pleading to citizens of Zimbabwe to help us find something to haunt the ones who took away his life, said Madenyika.\n\nElipa Jimu, the now deceaseds mother, is at pains to accept reality that her son is no more. Worse still, she cannot imagine the burden of taking care of her widowed daughter-in-law and her unborn child.\n\nI am in pain over my sons death; him and Melisa were the ones taking care of me.\n\nHe left a pregnant wife. I dont even know how I am going to take care of her. The preparation for the baby has not been bought yet. There even is no money for the funeral. I dont know where I am going to even get it. My son was supposed to bury me first, but it is me who is burying him, lamented Jimu\n\nTaurayi Chiedziso, a neighbour and friend, voiced his frustration over the tragedy.\n\nThis matter would have been resolved without even involving the police because we are neighbours, we are a community.\n\nNow, Blessed has died leaving behind his wife who is also pregnant. That child will grow without a father, its so heartbreaking, said Chiedziso.\n\n",
