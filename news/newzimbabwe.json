A considerable amount of resources was invested to guarantee its success. It is unlikely that an operation of this scale could have achieved its goals without substantial financial support.\n\nFor the record Mr Kudakwashe Tagwirei put in a total of 5 million litres of fuel, food and other provisions for soldiers as requested by the then CDF, General Chiwenga. Furthermore, he put in one million litres of fuel and US$1.6 million to the Party.\n\nTherefore, the success of Operation Restore Legacy cannot be attributed to a few individuals. Any such assertions are aimed at distorting the historical narrative for personal and political gain, said Ziyambi.\n\nTagwirei, who is a benefactor of ZANU PF, has recently been accused of using his proximity to President Emmerson Mnangagwa to acquire government tenders.\n\nThe controversial entrepreneur has also been the subject of attacks by former ZANU PF member and fugitive Blessed Geza, who has accused him of capturing the state and perpetuating corruption.\n\nTagwirei has remained mum on the allegations of corruption.\n\nZiyambi said the removal of Mugabe was a collective effort, warning a clique backing Chiwenga to desist from claiming heroism.\n\nIt is denied that only a few individuals, particularly the writers of this document, sacrificed their lives for the attainment of Operation Restore Legacy. Zimbabweans from all walks of life rose and participated in and supported Operation Restore Legacy.\n\nLet us acknowledge the collective effort that made Operation Restore Legacy possible and desist from claiming heroism for work done by many, said Ziyambi.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has hit back at his deputy Constantino Chiwenga, accusing him of incitement and treason in a fiery response to a corruption dossier presented to the politburo, a move that further exposes the deepening succession battle within Zanu PF.\n\nMnangagwa, through newly appointed Zanu PF Secretary for Legal Affairs Ziyambi Ziyambi, dismissed Chiwengas dossier, which bemoaned alleged party capture and internal rot, describing it as fundamentally flawed and evidence of ignorance of party procedures.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the document is fundamentally flawed, and its averments lack merit. It is my considered opinion that the document should be disregarded due to its material shortcomings and lack of appreciation of Party procedures and the national Constitution.\n\nAt its core, the document advocates for the unlawful removal of a constitutionally elected President, which is palpably treasonous. The document not only undermines the President but also the economy and individuals who work hard to support the Party.\n\nOne wonders whether the placement under sanctions of some of these individuals was not a result of such reckless utterances. Such reckless utterances have cost our economy, His Excellencys goodwill in the international fora, and individuals who have been unduly placed under sanctions, and in the end, no investor would want to invest in our country, said Ziyambi.\n\nIn his dossier, Chiwenga reportedly expressed strong opposition to the partys resolution to extend Mnangagwas tenure beyond the constitutionally mandated two terms, arguing that such a move undermines both the Constitution and party unity.\n\nZiyambi countered the argument, saying Chiwengas stance reflected a lack of understanding of Zanu PFs internal processes.\n\nIndeed, the President is a constitutionalist who has not deviated from the Constitution at any time. However, if the people have spoken, should the President disregard the will of the people? The author is patently disregarding the resolutions, and seems unaware of the provisions of Article 6, Section 34, subsections (2) to (5) of the Party Constitution, which outline the powers and functions of the National Peoples Conference.\n\nThe above assertion could be a result of the authors ignorance of the quoted legal provisions. However, such ignorance may be excusable for non-legal persons. What is being referred to as the 2030 Agenda derives from the 2024 resolutions of the Conference. Given the underlying circumstances, any attempt to destabilise the Government on the basis of such falsehoods is tantamount to treason, said Ziyambi further.\n\nThe heated exchange comes as Zanu PF prepares for its National Peoples Conference in Mutare this week, expected to be dominated by growing tensions between Mnangagwa and his deputy.\n\nParty insiders say the conference could set the tone for a bruising internal power struggle as political lines have clearly been drawn.\n\n",

            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nRaila Odinga, who was at the forefront of Kenyan politics for more than three decades and made five unsuccessful runs at the presidency, alleging that he was cheated of victory in every instance, has died. He was 80.\n\nOdinga passed away in India after suffering a heart attack, the Nairobi-based Star newspaper and other Kenyan media outlets reported.\n\nOdinga was the son of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, who served as Kenyas first vice president in Jomo Kenyattas administration. Considered political royalty in the East African nation, he was wildly popular among his supporters who heeded his calls en masse to demonstrate when he complained about vote rigging.\n\nThe electoral disputes repeatedly triggered ethnic tensions and violence, most notably in 2008, when more than 1,100 people died and about 350,000 were forced to flee their homes. The United Nations and then-South African leader Thabo Mbeki mediated a truce that saw Odinga being appointed prime minister in a coalition government led by President Mwai Kibaki.\n\nOdinga narrowly lost his fifth bid for the presidency to William Ruto in 2022. While the nations highest court upheld the election outcome, Odinga said he had proof the results had been tampered with and called a series of protests against the outcome and rising living costs. Dozens of people died in the ensuing unrest.\n\nThe two men later agreed to work together and members of Odingas party were appointed to the cabinet and other government posts.\n\nRaila Amolo Odinga was born on Jan. 7, 1945, in the western Kenyan town of Maseno. Prior to going into politics, he studied engineering in Germany, lectured at the University of Nairobi and co-founded his own firm.\n\nHe was arrested in 1982 after being accused of participating in an attempted coup led by air force officers to oust President Daniel Arap Moi. He spent six years in prison without trial and was detained twice subsequent to his release. His final incarceration ended in 1991, the year Kenyas constitution was amended to allow multiparty politics.\n\nOdinga helped found the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy and was selected as a lawmaker for the Langata constituency in the capital, Nairobi, in the 1992 election.\n\nHe first stood for the presidency in 1997 as the National Development Partys candidate. Four years later, he merged his party with Mois Kenya African National Union, was elected as its secretary-general and appointed energy minister.\n\nOdinga parted ways with Kanu in 2002, after Moi backed Uhuru Kenyatta to succeed him as party leader, and teamed up with Kibaki, who had mounted a third presidential campaign. Their coalition, the National Rainbow Alliance, won the vote, ending almost four decades of uninterrupted Kanu rule.\n\nKibaki named Odinga as his minister of roads and public works, but the two fell out in 2004 when Odinga accused the president of reneging on a power-sharing deal.\n\nThe Orange Democratic Movement nominated Odinga as its presidential candidate in 2007. It won 99 parliamentary seats, while Kibakis Party of National Unity won just 43. Even so, the official results showed Kibaki won the presidential vote  an outcome that was tainted by allegations of rigging.\n\nThe widespread violence that ensued prevented Odinga from taking power and he had to settle for the post of prime minister, which he held for five years.\n\nOdinga lost the presidential vote to Uhuru Kenyatta in 2013 and again in 2017. The Supreme Court annulled the outcome of the latter contest, citing widespread irregularities. Odinga then boycotted the re-run, saying the conditions werent in place for a fair contest.\n\nThe two men later reconciled and Kenyatta backed Odingas 2022 presidential run, reneging on an undertaking to support Ruto, his then-deputy. Ruto prevailed in the first round, however, and the result stood despite the oppositions legal challenges and protests.\n\nIn February 2025, Odinga stood for election as head of the African Unions executive arm, but lost the contest to Mahamoud Ali Youssouf from Djibouti.\n\nOdinga married his wife Ida in 1973. They had four children.\n\n",

Even members of his party, Irmar, voted overwhelmingly to impeach him.\n\nRajoelina rejected the vote, calling it null and void.\n\nThe African Union (AU) has warned against soldiers meddling in Madagascars political affairs and rejected any attempt at unconstitutional changes of government.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called the situation greatly worrying.\n\nThe island has gone through a series of political upheavals in recent years.\n\nMadagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world, with 75% of its 30 million people living below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.\n\n",

            "content": "By Enos Denhere\n\nThe fight against cervical cancer in Zimbabwe is gaining new energy, not from doctors in white coats or policymakers in offices, but from teenagers and young adults armed with smartphones, friend networks and a desire to save lives.\n\nWe realised that when health workers visit schools, children listen but often forget. When peers explain, the message sticks. These ambassadors know the slang, they know the platforms and they know the fears.\n\n Sister Shelly Majira, Kuwadzana Polyclinic\n\nCervical cancer is the most common cancer among women in the country, accounting for almost a third of all female cancer diagnoses, and its the single deadliest cancer in Zimbabweans of any sex. Its also preventable with a dose of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine  and thats a fact these young health ambassadors are trying to spotlight in WhatsApp groups and through community campaigns. Their work is reshaping health conversations, tackling stigma and ensuring that prevention is a priority for future generations.\n\nTapiwanashe Nyezana, 25, a youth health ambassador at Kuwadzana Polyclinic in the capital, Harare, speaks passionately about the importance of vaccinating young girls before they reach adulthood. I want to see children grow up healthy and capable of fulfilling their dreams. Good health is the foundation of a successful life, which motivated me to take on this role. I believe that young girls deserve the opportunity to be protected from cervical cancer through vaccination before they reach adulthood, she said.\n\nTapiwanashe Nyezana outside Kuwadzana Polyclinic. Credit: Enos Denhere\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the HPV vaccine became available free-of-charge to girls aged 1014, in line with World Health Organization guidance, in 2018, but achieving optimal coverage has proved challenging.\n\nOur campaigns always emphasise the benefits of vaccines and aim to help our communities overcome fear and misconceptions. We urge young girls and their parents to act promptly and ensure children have access to vaccines, because cervical cancer is preventable through vaccination, Nyezana said.\n\nBarbra Mangwiro, a vendor near Kuwadzana Polyclinic, previously believed vaccines had negative side-effects  after hearing deceptive rumours that they served hidden agendas. However, after receiving vaccine education from young health ambassadors and nurses, her perspective shifted.\n\nI used to think vaccines were harmful, but after learning about their importance, I allowed my children to be vaccinated at school when the Ministry of Health rolled out its vaccination programmes, she said. I encourage mothers to make sure their children, particularly girls, are vaccinated at an early age against cervical cancer because vaccines are important.\n\nBarbra Mangwiro a parent and a vendor near Kuwadzana Polyclinic. Credit: Enos Denhere\n\nWHO established the ambitious 90-70-90 goals for 2030 as part of its Global Strategy to expedite the eradication of cervical cancer as a public health issue in November 2020. Those targets stipulate that by the time they are 15 years old, 90% of girls should have received all recommended HPV vaccinations; by the time they are 35, and again 45 years old, 70% of women should have had a high-performance cervical cancer test; and 90% of women who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer or precancer should receive the proper care and treatment. WHO created the Elimination Planning Tool (EPT) to assist countries in meeting these goals based on the unique health needs of their populations.\n\nIn Zimbabwe youth ambassadors play a crucial role in translating this elimination strategy to the local level, according to the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Health and Child Care, Dr Aspect Maunganidze. Youth campaigners spread accurate information, address myths, and encourage early protection for girls aged 1014 years.\n\nLocal clinics are critical in our primary health care service delivery, and training youth advocates is fully aligned with our national HPV vaccination strategy, which aims to raise awareness, improve acceptance, and increase coverage.\n\nTheir efforts are essential as we work toward the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem, Dr Maunganidze said.\n\nDr. Aspect Maunganidze, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health and Child Care. Credit: Enos Denhere\n\nThat project received a boost recently, when the Ministry recently approved a single-dose HPV vaccination schedule, following WHO recommendations. Dr Maunganidze explained, The single-dose schedule is equally effective as the two-dose schedule, easier to deliver, and improves coverage by reducing missed doses.\n\nIn Kuwadzana, a high-density suburb of Harare, health workers are tapping into the power of peer influence to boost HPV vaccination among young girls. According to Sister Shelly Majira of Kuwadzana Polyclinic, the suburb has a population of 103,198, which includes 34,778 children under the age of 15. Among them, 10,630 are girls aged 10 to 14  the target group for the HPV vaccine in Zimbabwe.\n\nSister Shelly Majira explains HPV at Kuwadzana Polyclinic. Credit: Enos Denhere\n\nTo reach this group more effectively, the clinic partners with NGOs likeZvandiri, which runs a peer-counselling initiative aimed at kids and young people living with HIV, through a programme of youth health ambassadors. These young peer educators are trained in basic health communication, myth-busting and digital advocacy. Sister Majira, who supervises the ambassadors, emphasises the value of empowering youth to lead.\n\nWe realised that when health workers visit schools, children listen but often forget. When peers explain, the message sticks. These ambassadors know the slang, they know the platforms and they know the fears, she explained.\n\nSister Majira notes that one of the major barriers to vaccination is parental misconceptions. Many parents mistakenly believe that the HPV vaccine is intended for family planning. This perception contributes to low walk-in numbers at clinics.\n\nFrom January to May, only seven to 17 girls per month came for HPV vaccination at the clinic. However, when we engaged in school outreach programs, we saw a remarkable increase118 vaccinated in June and 357 in July. This shows that vigorous outreach, supported by our youth ambassadors, is key to reaching more children, she said.\n\nMonica Mutuma, one of the youth health ambassadors, explained that their work focuses on engaging young girls, and educating them about the importance of early vaccination to protect against cervical cancer. We share information on staying protected, fight against misinformation, and encourage vaccination while its still early.\n\nI can confidently say that around 70% of people we interact with are welcoming us, which shows we are making headway against misinformation.\n\n Monica Mutuma, youth health ambassador\n\nHowever, the final decision usually rests with the parents. Some of them used to believe the vaccine is for family planning or that it could cause infertility, she said.\n\nDespite encountering challenges  including a shortage of resources for creating flyers and accessing tools for data collection  Mutuma is optimistic about the impact of peer-led education. We are grateful to Sister Majira and her team for equipping us with the knowledge and skills to respond to questions during our outreaches and at the clinic. I can confidently say that around 70% of people we interact with are welcoming us, which shows we are making headway against misinformation, she added.\n\nPushing back against misinformation means making strides towards a safer future. In July, ten-year-old Keila Mazarura came home and told her mother, Ido Togaresei, about an HPV vaccination session that would be taking place at the school. In times past, Togaresei said, misconceptions would have caused her to forbid her child from receiving the jab. But lately its grown easier to access the facts. I permitted her to get the dose, Togaresei toldVaccinesWork.She was so happy about it, because it is her health that matters.\n\nThis article was originally published onVaccines Work.\n\n",
