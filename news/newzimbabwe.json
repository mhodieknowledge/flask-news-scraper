            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has thrown out businessman Julian Martin Hamilton Barns bid to be registered as a secured creditor in the estate of the late Phillip Mugadza, ruling that his application was clearly incompetent and wrongly sought to force the court to step into the shoes of the executor.\n\nIn a judgment handed down in Harare, Justice Sylvia Chirawu-Mugomba said Barns had misconceived the law on claims against deceased estates and tried to bypass the executors statutory powers.\n\nThe order sought is akin to asking this court to step into the shoes of the first respondent and literally force the acceptance of the claims, as if to ask this court to now act as the executor, the judge said. This court cannot be substituted for the executor.\n\nBarns argued that he had advanced payments amounting to US$193,600 on behalf of Mugadza to stave off foreclosure of his Gunhill property, and sought to compel executor Emmanuel Ngwarati to register him as a secured creditor. But the executor rejected the claim, citing a lack of supporting documents, absence of any lending agreement, and the fact that some payments were made to third parties and not to the deceased himself.\n\nMugomba said the executor had duly provided reasons for rejecting the claim.\n\nWhether they are adequate or not is neither here nor there, she observed. The applicant wants this court to put all the claims under a microscope and literally force the first respondent to accept them. All these questions and issues can only lead to one logical conclusion. This court cannot be substituted for the executor.\n\nThe judge also criticised both sides legal representatives for failing to properly engage with the key legal issues. Had all the legal practitioners applied their minds, perhaps they would have been more helpful to the court. Because they did not, this impacts the order of costs.\n\nConcluding, Justice Chirawu-Mugomba dismissed the application, ordering each party to bear its own costs.\n\nThe application is akin to one for review disguised as a court application to compel. It is clearly incompetent, she ruled.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nAs the Zanu-PF succession war intensifies, President Emmerson Mnangagwa has issued a stern warning, telling senior party members to fall in line, stressing that individualism has no place within his party.\n\nMnangagwa addressed a Politburo meeting at party headquarters in Harare on Wednesday, amid escalating tensions within Zanu-PF as rivals jostle to succeed him in 2028, when his current term expires.\n\nParty spokesperson Chris Mutsvangwa told the press a couple of weeks ago that controversial business tycoon Kudakwashe Tagwirei, the newly co-opted Zanu-PF Central Committee member, could not buy his way to the top of the party leadership. He asserted that measures to halt Tagwireis bid to rise to the Central Committee had been put in place.\n\nHowever, weeks later, Zanu-PF Secretary for Legal Affairs Patrick Chinamasa dismissed Mutsvangwas attempt to block Tagwireis ascent into the partys Central Committee as a wasted effort, via a post on social media platform X.\n\nMnangagwa convened the Politburo meeting in the absence of his deputy, Constantino Chiwenga, who is understood to be in India on state business.\n\nChairing Wednesdays Politburo meeting, Mnangagwa warned that the bad apples determined to tear the party apart must be cautioned.\n\nTactics and political chicanery meant to mislead, confuse, as well as divide the Party and nation, must be nipped in the bud.\n\nWe must all speak with one voice and march in one direction. Leaders of the Party are bound by collective responsibility and must unite around Party decisions and resolutions which serve as our ideological and moral compass. Hauroti zvinhu kumba kwako woenda uchitaura sehurongwa hweMusangano, he said.\n\nMnangagwa further urged party members to communicate with discipline, as officials have been using social media to attack each other while the power struggle intensifies.\n\nOur communication must be disciplined. MuZANU PF tinomira pachokwadi. Zvemazvake mazvake, pasi nazvo.\n\nZanu-PF factionalism is becoming increasingly apparent, with two distinct groups  one aligned to Mnangagwa and the other to Chiwenga  seeking to outmanoeuvre one another.\n\nMnangagwa views controversial tenderpreneurs like Kudakwashe Tagwirei and Wicknell Chivayo as genuine philanthropists, while Chiwenga has labelled them zvigananda  those who loot state resources to enrich themselves at the expense of impoverished Zimbabweans.\n\nThis division between Mnangagwa and Chiwenga has become so evident that it seems only a matter of time before all hell breaks loose.\n\nMnangagwa is allegedly seeking to extend his term beyond 2028, although he has publicly denied this ambition on more than one occasion.\n\nChiwenga is projecting himself as an anti-corruption champion, asserting that he will not tolerate corruption at any cost, describing it as a threat to national security.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nA South African influencer linked to a controversial job scheme in Russia has apologised for her role in promoting it in a country where many young people are desperate to find jobs.\n\nCyan Boujee, whose real name is Honour Zuma, came under scrutiny after one of the videos she posted online advertising jobs for women aged between 18 and 22 went viral.\n\nIt prompted the government to issue a warning about the scheme and alert people to the dangers of human trafficking and unverified job opportunities overseas.\n\nImmediately when I saw the comments on my stories and on my videos I knew that this is not something I stand with, the 24-year-old told her 902,000 followers on Instagram.\n\nPopularly known as Cyan, the influencer has removed the promotional videos from her social media pages. They had described an opportunity for a fresh new start for young women at the start of their careers.\n\nIn a video shot in Tatarstan in Russia and posted over the weekend on TikTok, where she has 1.7 million followers, Cyan had said it was a two-year start programme for those wanting to acquire professional skills  though it was not made clear in what professions.\n\nShe had explained those hired would be given jobs and taught how to speak Russian.\n\nThere have been allegations that some of those recruited to work in Tatarstan have ended up working in a weapons factory, making drones that have been used in Russias war in Ukraine.\n\nIn her Instagram apology, Cyan acknowledged that human trafficking is a very, very serious matter, adding that the backlash had been a huge learning curve for her and and all the other influencers.\n\nI knew this is something I had to delete immediately, I didnt care about the money, she said.\n\nI apologise and I believe that this is not something that will be repeated again.\n\nThere has been a huge fallout on social media over the job videos, with a petition launched calling on influencers to use their platforms to instead spread awareness about the signs and dangers of trafficking.\n\nThe authorities have launched an investigation into the scheme. Deputy Justice Minister Andries Nel said so-called opportunities were often linked to serious risks of labour exploitation and human trafficking.\n\nNever rely solely on social media promotions or unsolicited social media advertisements, always cross-check and verify job opportunities through official channels, he said on Wednesday.\n\nOne of the main recruiters in the scheme promoted by Cyan and other influencers is a special economic zone in Tatarstan, which is where weapons are believed to be produced.\n\nA report by the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime released in May looked into the recruitment of people for the start programme.\n\nIt said that potential recruits are enticed to participate under false pretences regarding the nature of the work, the working conditions and opportunities for education, adding that the objective is to support the drone production programme.\n\nMost work directly in drone production, while others work as support staff  cleaners and caterers.\n\nIn one of her now-deleted videos, Cyan had said apparently girls are treated fairly here  Africans, Asians, Latin Americans.\n\n",
