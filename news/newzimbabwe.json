Biti was to be forced out.\n\nTimba now leads another distinct CCC faction reportedly loyal to Chamisa.\n\nThis time, Tshabangu stands accused of unilaterally and illegally making appointments to the partys local government caucus and other committees.\n\nOn Thursday last week he appointed Mafume head of the partys local government caucus and named other councillors as officials in a move dismissed by another faction of CCC represented by its spokesperson Willias Madzimure.\n\nThe battle for control of the party between Tshabangu and Ncube has been ongoing since the two reportedly connived to push out other senior members.\n\nTshabangu is also accused of failing to account for government-allocated political party funds released to the opposition formation.\n\n",

He had left the country in October following a disputed election that has sparked months of violent protests and thrown the country into turmoil.\n\nEmerging from the airport with a Bible in hand, Mondlane prayed and took an oath, mimicking a presidential swearing-in ceremony. He declared himself the legitimately elected president, rejecting the official results that favored Frelimos candidate, Daniel Chapo, who is set to be inaugurated on Wednesday, January 15.\n\nMondlane stated that he is ready for dialogue with the government. He says his return is to stop the killings of his supporters and lead protests.\n\nSince October, hundreds of people have reportedly been killed, many shot by police, during protests sparked by allegations of electoral fraud.\n\nMondlane said he left Mozambique fearing for his life after two senior members of his opposition party were killed in their car by unknown gunmen in a late-night shooting in the aftermath of the election.\n\nPolice on Thursday blocked roads leading to the airport after Mondlane said on social media earlier this week he would return to the southern African country. Tear gas drifted over the airport and surrounding roads and a helicopter hovered overhead.\n\nThousands of Mondlanes supporters were expected to gather in Maputo for his return, prompting the clampdown by security forces.\n\nMore than 100 people have been killed by security forces since Mozambique erupted in protests that Mondlane called for after the long-ruling Frelimo party was declared the winner of the Oct. 9 election.\n\nMondlane and other opposition candidates accused the ruling party of rigging the election and international observers reported irregularities in the vote and the alteration of some results.\n\n",

            "content": "By VOA\n\nGOVERNMENT officials in Zimbabwe have been scrutinizing a Chinese mining company that has been operating a gold mine in the countrys east since at least 2021.\n\nThe scrutiny comes as residents voice concern about the impact on health and the environment.\n\nThe company in question is Sino Africa Huijin Holdings, which faces accusations of severe environmental destruction and community harm.\n\nIts gold prospecting operations have been taking place in an area known as Premier Estate in the Mutasa District of Manicaland.\n\nVillagers and community groups have complained about the blasting that has taken place at the mine. Nearby residents have reported widespread ecological damage, including the decimation of a mountain and the displacement of wildlife. They also say tremors from the blasts have caused structural damage to homes.\n\nResidents further complain of dust pollution and the potential contamination of water sources due to alleged leaching of cyanide. Cyanide leaching is a method of extracting gold from ore that can pollute water resources.\n\nAdding to these concerns, Sino Africa is accused of forging community signatures on their Environmental Impact Assessment document, raising questions about the transparency and legitimacy of their operations.\n\nThe complaints prompted the government to shut down the mines operations twice in 2024. In the past two months, however, mining has resumed.\n\nWe are between a rock and a hard place. If its possible, let them compensate us and relocate us because its no longer appealing, Ishewedenga Moyo, one of 30 residents living within some 300 meters of the Sino Africa Huijin mine, told VOA in December.\n\nThe vibrations and noise generated by mining blasting are disrupting wildlife habitats and ecosystems, damaging biodiversity, and causing cracks in our homes, Moyo added.\n\nGovernment-ordered suspensions\n\nA Manicaland Joint Command Task Force, composed of a number of government entities, ordered the temporary closure of Sino Africa Huijins gold mining operations twice. Officials say the shutdowns were enforced to ensure the mine met all necessary requirements.\n\nThe first suspension occurred in October and lasted two weeks. Sino Africa Huijin made pledges to improve the situation and was allowed to resume operations. Then, the task force ordered the mine to close a second time in mid-November.\n\nTraditional Chief James Kurauone of the Mutasa district told VOA on Dec. 11 that officials forced Sino Africa Huijings operations to stop each time because the company failed to address critical concerns raised by the local community.\n\nThese concerns that led to the temporary closure included severe air pollution, destructive blasting activities impacting local homes, and the companys failure to fulfill its corporate social responsibility obligations, said Mutasa in recent comments.\n\nMutasa added that he plans to convene a meeting with mining officials and members from the community to discuss a path forward in a couple of weeks.\n\nMining compliance\n\nMining operations resumed on November 25 at the conclusion of discussions among government officials, community leaders and company representatives.\n\nDaniel Panganai, the current HR manager of Sino Africa Huijin, was involved in the discussions. He told VOA in mid-December that the company complied with all the requirements outlined in writing, but I cannot divulge much information at this time.\n\nMisheck Mugadza, the Manicaland minister of state, also said in December that Sino Africa Huijin committed to adhering to all mining and environmental regulations. He said the Chinese company had acted on its social responsibility obligations by donating to the local hospital and drilling a well to provide water to the local school.\n\nThe government is closely monitoring the companys operations, Mugadza said, and some households have already received full compensation for damages. He further stated that the company is obligated to compensate all affected residents.\n\nChinese investments in Zimbabwean mines\n\nThe controversy surrounding the Sino Africa Huijin mine is not isolated, according to a September report by the Center for Natural Resource Governance, or CNRG, a Harare-based community rights organization.\n\nThe report, which assessed the impact of Chinese investment on Zimbabwes mining industry, found that Chinese mining ventures have led to widespread environmental degradation, disregard for the cultural rights of host communities, and, in many cases, the violation of the countrys labor laws, often with apparent impunity.\n\nChinese investors control an estimated 90% of the of Zimbabwes mining industry, according to the report.\n\nIn 2023 alone, Sino investments in Zimbabwes mining sector saw 121 investors contributing a staggering $2.79 billion, said CNRG Executive Director Farai Maguwu, who was quoted in a post on the organizations website.\n\nSeparately, another area resident voiced criticism of the governments response to the mining.\n\nThere are times when the mine uses explosives of higher magnitude, and there will be tremors, said area resident Thobekile Mhenziwamukuru.\n\nWhen we call the government officials about the crisis, they always go directly alone to the Sino mine offices without any community leaders, then they will come and address us, just saying they will use explosives of low magnitude next time and we now know that its now their cash cow.\n\nEven in terms of closing and reopening of the mine, instead of solving our grievances, there is no fairness in everything because money is being exchanged to slow the progress and we hope higher offices in government will come to rescue us, she concluded.\n\nMaguwu accused local lawmakers of corruption, saying, Instead of enforcing the law, they are cashing in on this illegality by forcing them to close down, demanding bribes for reopening, and then returning to close them down again and demand another bribe.\n\nDespite repeated phone calls and visits to the offices of government stakeholders to address these accusations, including the Ministry of Mines and the Environmental Management Agency, VOA received no response.\n\nThis cycle goes on and on while the environment is being sacrificed, Maguwu said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nAMALGAMATED Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) has vowed to fight government over what it terms illegal elevation of the retirement age.\n\nARTUZ president, Obert Masaraure said his organisation will not sit and relax whilst civil servants rights are trampled upon by President Emmerson Mnangagwas administration.\n\nThe elevation of the retirement age of civil servants is illegal on the front of the right to collective bargaining.\n\nIf you go through the Constitution of Zimbabwe, particularly Section 203 (i) (b), states that the conditions of service shall be fixed by the Commission but following through what is set out in Section 65 (v) were the right to bargaining so where a retirement age is part of the whole retirement package for the civil servants.\n\nThis cannot be unilaterally fixed by a bunch of people from the employers side wherever they meet in Cabinet or wherever they meet, we do not care, Masaraure said.\n\nHe added: As long as they have not engaged the employee side to then say, what is rational of this particular change, we find such a change both inappropriate and illegal.\n\nThat is why we are up against it.\n\nGovernment recently extended the retirement age from 45 years to 55 for police officers whilst the military will be allowed to retire at 65 from 50 with an allowance to get to 70 years.\n\nwe understand that the ruling elites are locked in power tussles. We however have a responsibility to fight for labour justice and right to education. Our responsibilities will not be shelved to allow factions of the ruling elites to settle their power issues. We will continue with the fight demanding urgent solutions to the questions of the day.\n\nWe are getting ready to push back against underpayment and the illegal elevation of the retirement age, Masaraure wrote on social media.\n\nDuring an interview with NewZimbabwe.com this Wednesday, Masaraure argued that factionalism had taken centre stage in the ruling Zanu PF party causing destructive decisions which do not take into consideration youths, who are supposed to be given a chance to occupy the few available jobs in the country.\n\nMost young graduates are unemployed as government amid government failure to create jobs for those churned out of universities and colleges yearly.\n\nWe look at the rate of unemployment of our young people and realise that this government cannot create jobs.\n\nWhy then do they want to keep old people occupying the little jobs that are there in the Republic, Masaraure queried.\n\nThere are issues to do with mental capacity of the person to say as we grow old, we get incapacitated. So why are we not giving the best brains; young people who are fresh graduates an opportunity to provide services to the people of Zimbabwe?\n\nWe need to build a strong State bureaucracy and that needs competent people who are highly energetic and young, but if we are going to be retaining our old friends in the interest of power retention, we are sabotaging the agenda of national development and unfortunately this is the path that has been chosen by the regime.\n\nWe will be protesting against it and rejecting it, and it will be reversed, Masaraure vowed.\n\nFundamentals such as the life expectancy of Zimbabweans which is now below 60 are some of the issues to include when a government changes laws or policies, said the trade unionist.\n\n",
