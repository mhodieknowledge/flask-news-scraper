            "content": "By Ashfak Mohamed l IOL\n\nWHEN you hear Darrien Landsberg talk, you can understand why he is an all-action figure on the pitch for the Lions.\n\nThe No 5 lock is an energetic presence for the Johannesburg franchise, and has taken his game to the next level this season.\n\nHe was perhaps unlucky to miss out on an invitation to the Springbok alignment camp taking place in Cape Town next week, especially considering the fact that there are injuries to a number of second-rowers at the moment.\n\nAll of Eben Etzebeth, Ruan Nortj and JD Schickerling are on the sidelines, and Landsberg is able to fulfil both lock roles.\n\nBorn in Zimbabwe but raised in Johannesburg, where he attended Northcliff High School, the 26-year-old has yet to feature for his country of his birth.\n\nThat indicates that he is arguably still waiting for a Bok call-up, and looking at his performances over the last few months, he is clearly determined to keep on knocking on Rassie Erasmus door.\n\nSolid in the lineouts and a high work-rate in defence, Landsbergs point of difference is his agility as a ball-carrier. He almost always seems to be up with the play, ready to take a pass or pop from a teammate, and is the stereotype of what a Lions forward is all about.\n\nHe was at it again in last weeks 38-14 United Rugby Championship victory over the Sharks at Ellis Park, and will be eager for a repeat in Saturdays return clash at Kings Park in Durban (2pm start).\n\nLandsberg speaks as quickly as he plays, and he will join Ruben Schoeman in the Lions engine-room in trying to outwit and outlast Sharks lock pair Jason Jenkins and Emile van Heerden.\n\nIve been blessed to get the opportunity, and how I see myself going? It can only be God. None of this is me! Landsberg said with sheer modesty this week.\n\nMy team are motivating me a lot and giving me the opportunity to express myself  and getting the backing from the Boks in the team.\n\nThat almost pushes me to open up my opportunities and eyes to have bigger goals.\n\nWe let ourselves down against the Bulls, so it was definitely a game (against the Sharks last week) that we needed to rectify things.\n\nIn the week, we had set out a plan of action, and we couldnt have asked for a better way to execute it.\n\nSo, big-ups to the boys for that one. But this week coming up is a whole different challenge. Its only a weeks turnaround, so I dont think theres much that can be changed.\n\nThe only thing that can be a point of difference is who wants it more. The effort that goes into the collisions\n\nYou read articles where they felt they were physically dominated, so theyre definitely going to come out and prove a point.\n\nBut that will push us more to up our physicality even more and improve from last week.\n\nLions coach Ivan van Rooyen had to re-jig his loose trio on Friday, due to injuries to Bok flank Ruan Venter and former Blitzboks star JC Pretorius.\n\nThe dynamic Siba Qoma will replace Venter at No 7, and fetcher Jarod Cairns will fill Pretorius boots at openside flank.\n\nVan Rooyen will hope that the absence of Venter and Pretorius wont affect the Lions all-out attacking approach, as they ran the Sharks off their feet last week.\n\nBut with the Durban humidity and an obvious response expected from the home side, it is unlikely to be as easy an encounter this time around.\n\nThe fact that theyre wounded thats a dangerous aspect. I hear its going to be a packed Kings Park, so we must go there with the right mindset to get the W, Landsberg said.\n\nIf we get the win, it moves us to fifth or sixth on the log, and then we have four home games after our tour (to Europe).\n\nIt will definitely be a big confidence-booster, and we are also going up a lot of Boks in the Sharks side, and want to help our guys going to the alignment camp.\n\nIts about building consistency, go through the processes in the week, and the game will take care of itself.\n\nTeams For Durban\n\nLions: 15 Tapiwa Mafura 14 Richard Kriel 13 Manuel Rass 12 Marius Louw 11 Edwill van der Merwe 10 Gianni Lombard 9 Morn van den Berg 8 Francke Horn (captain) 7 Siba Qoma 6 Jarod Cairns 5 Darrien Landsberg 4 Ruben Schoeman 3 Asenathi Ntlabakanye 2 PJ Botha 1 Juan Schoeman.\n\nBench: 16 Franco Marais 17 Morgan Naud 18 Conraad van Vuuren 19 Ruan Delport 20 Izan Esterhuizen 21 Nico Steyn 22 WJ Steenkamp 23 Rynhardt Jonker.\n\nSharks: 15 Henry Immelman 14 Yaw Penxe 13 Jurenzo Julius 12 Francois Venter 11 Ethan Hooker 10 Jordan Hendrikse 9 Grant Williams 8 Siya Kolisi (captain) 7 Lappies Labuschagne 6 Phepsi Buthelezi 5 Emile van Heerden 4 Jason Jenkins 3 Vincent Koch 2 Bongi Mbonambi 1 Ox Nche.\n\nBench: 16 Fez Mbatha 17 Nthuthuko Mchunu 18 Hanro Jacobs 19 Corn Rahl 20 James Venter 21 Nick Hatton 22 Jaden Hendrikse 23 Hakeen Kunene.\n\n",

In my opinion, we were the better side. Unfortunately, we could not put the ball in the net, said Chigowe.\n\nWith this result, Herentals remain unbeaten in the league, having beaten Telone 2-1 last weekend.\n\nHerentals coach Paul Benza expressed satisfaction with the draw.\n\nIt was a very difficult game. Dynamos came at us strongly in the first half. They had a lot of chances but failed to score, and we are very happy because, at the end of the day, we managed a clean sheet and a point, said Benza.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA DECADE after the disappearance of human rights activist and journalist Itai Dzamara, pressure is mounting on the Zanu PF government to provide answers.\n\nCampaigners and activists have condemned the ruling party, with some branding it a terrorist organisation that must be held to account for Dzamaras disappearance.\n\nItai Dzamara\n\nDzamara was last seen on March 9, 2015, when he was allegedly taken from his home in Glenview, Harare, by State security operatives in an unmarked vehicle.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding his disappearance remain shrouded in mystery, prompting renewed calls for a thorough and transparent investigation.\n\nAward-winning human rights lawyer and Principal Managing Partner at Tsunga Bhamu Law International, Arnold Tsunga, has implored the President Emmerson Mnangagwa-led government to make a public announcement explaining why it has failed to bring the perpetrators of Dzamaras disappearance to justice.\n\nThe government has to do all in its powers to make a public and open announcement on why it has not been possible to bring the perpetrators of the abduction of Itai Dzamara to account, he said.\n\nThe failure of any progress, it really affects human rights activists and in particular it affects the family. The family of a disappeared person, they suffer uncertainty, trauma, and they dont have closure, he added.\n\nIts a threat to the rule of law; its a threat to the justice and accountability. It reduces confidence of people in the ability of our law enforcement system to be able to protect the citizens.\n\nFormer Zengeza West MP Job Sikhala stated that the Zanu PF-led government knows the whereabouts of Dzamara and owes the public an explanation as to what happened to him.\n\nThe regime knows what happened to Itai Dzamara, Sikhala said.\n\nIt is the duty of every government to protect its citizens. The security of every person falls in the hands of the State. We still demand with our loud voices to know what happened to Itai. It remains a serious issue of public interest, he added.\n\nHuman rights defender and Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) president Obert Masaraure minced no words for Zanu PF, describing it as a terrorist organisation and warning that the perpetrators of Dzamaras disappearance would eventually face retribution.\n\nThe Dzamara story reminds us that the Zanu PF party is a terrorist organisation. We will not tire to demand the return of Dzamara. Those who abducted him Dzamara will be forced to pay in the coming Zimbabwe, he said.\n\nEfforts to obtain comment from the government were unsuccessful, as both Information Minister Jenfan Muswere and Information Permanent Secretary Nick Mangwana could not be reached on their mobile phones.\n\nHowever, Zanu PF Director of Communication Farai Marapira asserted that human rights defenders and activists carry the burden of proof, as they are the ones making unfounded allegations against his party, which he described as a law-abiding institution.\n\nHe who alleges must prove. It is sad that some people would seek cheap mileage over another familys anguish. We are a law-abiding institution which holds the laws of our land sacrosanct. It is crass madness to then associate us with such a vile accusation, Marapira said.\n\nZimbabwe has neither signed nor ratified the United Nations International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance despite repeated calls to do so by UN Member States. The government, it seems, is dragging its feet on this issue.\n\nThis convention came into being in 2006 and started being implemented in 2010.\n\nLast year, human rights lawyer Obey Shava, represented by renowned lawyer Tendai Biti, took Mnangagwas government to the High Court, arguing that the administration must ratify the United Nations Convention against enforced disappearance treaty.\n\nShava deplored what he described as a systematic pattern of enforced disappearance, abduction, torture, and cruel and degrading treatment. He asserted that numerous individuals, including himself, human rights defenders, opposition political party supporters, legislators, and ordinary citizens, have been subjected to these acts, with some also being injected with unknown substances.\n\n",
