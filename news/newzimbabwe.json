Two of the four suspects are foreign nationals.\n\nAccording to police, the gun battle erupted after detectives tracked down a motorised robbery syndicate that had reportedly crossed into Zimbabwe from South Africa to carry out a series of armed robberies in Bulawayo, Harare, and Kwekwe.\n\nAs the detectives were following, the suspects fired at them resulting in a serious exchange of fire near Norton Tollgate, along HarareBulawayo Road, said Nyathi.\n\nFollowing the shootout, detectives recovered the gangs getaway vehicle, a Toyota Axio, and a cache of weapons including a Girsan 9mm Parabellum pistol with two rounds, another 9mm Parabellum pistol with one round, as well as clothing items believed to have been used during recent robberies.\n\nOne of the suspects was captured on CCTV wearing the recovered shoes and jacket during an armed robbery incident which occurred on 30th September 2025 at a local hospital in Harare, where US$1,833 cash and airtime recharge cards worth US$140 were stolen, the police statement revealed.\n\nInvestigations show the slain gang was linked to at least five armed robberies committed in Harare and Bulawayo between 25th June and 3rd October 2025, including a case in Njube, Bulawayo, where robbers made off with US$8,000 and an iPhone.\n\nNyathi said police would continue to act decisively against armed criminal networks operating in Zimbabwe.\n\nZRP reiterates that there is no going back in the fight against armed robbery cases in the country, he said. All syndicates, whether locally or foreign-based, will be decisively dealt with in line with the countrys laws.\n\nHe urged the public to assist law enforcement efforts by reporting any suspicious criminal activity.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nFORMER Energy minister Fortune Chasi has called on Zimbabweans to stop blaming Chinese for environmental degradation, arguing that local corruption and weak governance are at the heart of the countrys mining-related ecological damage.\n\nChasi was responding to growing outrage over the ongoing destruction of Christmas Pass Mountain in Mutare, where the Chinese reportedly working in collusion with political elites are accused of tearing apart the landmark for mineral extraction.\n\nThere have been various videos on social media showing the destruction going on in the Christmas Pass Mountain with locals accusing the Chinese of damaging the scenic environment.\n\nThis comes at a time when mountains, monuments and escarpments are being destroyed countrywide by Chinese companies in the mining sector with examples being Boterekwa in Shurugwi, Muvaradonha Wilderness in Muzarabani and now Christmas Pass.\n\nResponding to one of the debates on X, Chasi said while Chinese investors are often vilified for destructive mining practices, the real problem lies with local officials who enable such activities for personal gain.\n\nFor years, we have blamed the Chinese for destroying our environment through mining, but the truth is harder to face, the real culprits are locals.\n\nLocal officials sign the licences, local elites pocket the facilitation fees. Local silence allows rivers to turn into sludge. The Chinese did not corrupt our system, they found it already for sale, Chasi wrote.\n\nThe former energy minister argued that environmental destruction in Zimbabwe reflects a broader governance crisis rather than foreign exploitation alone.\n\nThis isnt a Chinese problem. It is a governance problem. If rules can be bought, someones selling, he added.\n\nEvery destroyed riverbed tells a local story, a signature, a bribe, a blind eye. Foreign miners only exploit the vacuum we created.\n\nBlaming outsiders has become a fashionable, convenient self-deception. Environmental destruction thrives because enforcement is selective and oversight compromised, Chasi wrote.\n\nThe reform we need is not about nationality; it is about integrity.\n\nUntil our institutions stop trading ecological integrity for quick cash, nothing will change. The Chinese did not destroy our mountains and rivers. Our signatures did, he added.\n\n",

What this means is that the appellant never disputed the terms of the contract as spelt out by the respondent and never disputed breaching the contract.\n\nThe church had paid Rockshade for the hire of a new 60-seater bus to transport congregants to a seminar in Botswana.\n\nBut it later discovered the company only had a single 50-seater already hired out. Rockshade then offered an old 57-seater bus instead  a move that left the church with 60 confirmed travellers but only 57 seats.\n\nMCZ described the replacement bus as very old, with worn seats, a dirty fridge and toilet, and earmarked for scrapping. The court said this amounted to a clear breach.\n\nBy refusing to avail the 60-seater bus (having earlier misrepresented to the respondent that it had the bus), the appellant repudiated the contract, the judgment stated.\n\nThe respondent acted properly in suing for a refund the moment the appellant indicated its unwillingness to be bound by the terms of the contract.\n\nThe High Court partially allowed the appeal only to remove a Magistrates Court directive that the refund be paid within 24 hours, ruling instead that Rockshade must simply pay the money and costs of suit.\n\nAll other grounds of appeal are red herrings. Nothing turns on them,Chikowero ruled.\n\nEach party was ordered to bear its own costs of the appeal.\n\n",

Regardless of the circumstances or emotions of the moment, there is no justification for my actions, and I take full responsibility for the hurt and embarrassment they may have caused you, Chiragwi said.\n\nThe gaffer went on to reveal that he has since stepped aside as Warriors head coach ahead of two World Cup Qualifiers games.\n\nIn the spirit of transparency and respect for due process, I have stepped aside from my national team duties for the upcoming FIFA World Cup Qualifiers to allow all disciplinary procedures to take place without prejudice.\n\nI will cooperate fully with the investigations by the PSL and any other relevant authorities and accept whatever outcome or sanction is deemed appropriate.\n\nI remain committed to learning from this incident, rebuilding trust, and proving through my actions that this mistake does not define me, further stated Chiragwi.\n\n",
