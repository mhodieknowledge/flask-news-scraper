            "content": "CricTracker\n\nZimbabwes star player Sikandar Raza has become the top-ranked all-rounder in the ICC Mens ODI Player Rankings for the first time in his career after a fine show in the two-match series against Sri Lanka in Harare.\n\nThe 39-year-old scored 92 and 59 not out in the two matches and took one wicket in the series to overtake the Afghanistan pair of Azmatullah Omarzai and Mohammad Nabi, who are now placed second and third, respectively. Razas previous best was the second position that he attained in December 2023.\n\nRazas aggregate of 151 runs also lifted him nine places to 22nd position in the batting rankings, which is two places off his career-best 24th position reached in June 2023. He has also gained one spot to reach 38th position among bowlers.\n\nSri Lanka opener Pathum Nissanka, who topped the aggregate with 198 runs to be named the Player of the Series, has moved up seven places to 13th position while Janith Liyanage (up 13 places to 29th) of Sri Lanka and Sean Williams of Zimbabwe (up three places to 47th) are others to move up the batting rankings after the series.\n\nScotland batter George Munsey is up three places to 34th after a match-winning 84 not out against Canada in the ICC Mens Cricket World Cup League 2 while South Africas Tony de Zorzi has moved from 67th to 64th.\n\nThe ODI bowling rankings see South Africa spinner Keshav Maharaj shake off Sri Lanka spinner Maheesh Theekshana to take the sole No. 1 position after a match-winning haul of four for 22 in the first ODI against England in Leeds with Jofra Archer (up six places to 19th) and Lungi Ngidi (up five places to joint-23rd) among the others to move up the bowling rankings after the match.\n\nAsitha Fernando has advanced six places to 31st while Dilshan Madushankas match-winning four for 62 in the first Harare ODI, that included a hat-trick, has lifted him from 60th to 52nd position.\n\nThe ICC Mens T20I Player Rankings see Afghanistan batters Ibrahim Zadran and Sediqullah Atal make huge progress after helping beat Pakistan in a tri-series match in Sharjah with scores of 65 and 64, respectively. Zadran is up 12 places to 20th while Atal has rocketed 346 places to 127th position.\n\nPakistan batters Hasan Nawaz (up two places to joint-31st) is among those to gain in the batting rankings while Sufiyan Muqeem (up 11 places to 22nd), Shaheen Afridi (up eight places to 26th and Mohammad Nawaz (up 15 places to 43rd) are among those to move up the bowling rankings.\n\nRazas upward movement may have resulted in Nabi slipping to third position in the ODI all-rounders list, but he has moved up one spot to second position among T20I all-rounders.\n\n",

Since his arrival, he has featured in every match his new team has played.\n\nHis latest outing came over the weekend when he helped Marinhense advance to the second round of the Taa de Portugal knockout tournament.\n\nIts always difficult to adapt to a new environment, but Im happy with how Im settling in here. My teammates and coaches have welcomed me warmly, Chimedza said.\n\nIve played at least four competitive games so far, and in our last cup match, I was pleased to contribute to the teams progress to the next stage.\n\nChimedza signed for Gil Vicente earlier this year but was unable to feature due to delays in the clearance of his international papers. As a result, he was loaned out to gain game time and experience.\n\nThe former MK Dons player hopes his spell at Marinhense will prepare him for a return to his parent club.\n\nMy focus is on working hard and contributing to Marinhenses success. At the end of the season, my target is to return to Gil Vicente and cement my place in the team, he added.\n\nBorn in Harare, Chimedza moved to England at the age of 14 after being scouted by English League Two side MK Dons, where he developed before moving to Portugal this year.\n\n",
