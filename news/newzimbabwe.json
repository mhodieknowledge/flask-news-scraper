            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nTHE new Commissioner-General of Police, Stephen Mutamba this Friday officially took over the reins of the countrys police service at a colourful ceremony held in Harare.\n\nMutamba replaced Godwin Matanga, who was retired on January 1, 2025.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa, for unknown reasons, recently retired Matanga and elevated his deputy to assume overall leadership at Police General Headquarters (PGHQ).\n\nSpeaking during a handover-and-takeover event at Mkushi Depot (formerly Morris Depot) in Harare this Friday, Matanga dispelled rumour that he wanted to cling on to his lofty post citing irregularities in his retirement procedure.\n\nMatanga said he was properly served with notice of his retirement by Mnangagwas office, quashing rumour that he had reported for duty after his dismissal from the service.\n\nMay l take this opportunity to clarify an incorrect position that has been peddled in the media recently pertaining to my retirement.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, listen carefully, I was properly served by the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, His Excellency Cde Dr. E.D. Mnangagwa at a time when my retirement was due, he explained.\n\nHis utterances cleared the air after social media reported the outgoing police chief had dramatically reported for duty, claiming he was not properly dismissed.\n\nThe outgoing police chief said he was delighted to address officers and officials witnessing the change of guard.\n\nFor me personally, it is a boundless moment of delight as I bid farewell to longstanding colleagues to an organisation that I served over a long period of time.\n\nAlas, the day will certainly come when we have to separate from the organisation that we have so much and equally drew a lot of friendships, experiences and livelihoods\n\nAllow me, therefore, to express my heartfelt gratitude to His Excellency the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe Cde Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa for according me the privilege to serve the nation in the Office of the Commissioner General Police.\n\nHe added: I am grateful for his guidance and indeed the security infrastructure for their enduring support during my tenure. More importantly, my sincere gratitude goes to the general public of Zimbabwe, my regional peers and the regional police chiefs and the media for the support they rendered to my tenure.\n\nI am, however, confident that a new broom sweeps clean, and my successor will be able to ride on my achievements that we have made and tackle existing challenges head on.\n\nI am comforted to pass the baton to Cde Stephen Mutamba whom l have been with in the trenches for so many years and have known his capacity to steer the ship going forward.\n\nMatanga thanked all the deputy Commissioner Generals and junior ranking cops for their unwavering support during his tenure.\n\nI wish to also thank all senior officers and junior officers and members of the police service who shared and advanced the vision of the organisation through the provision of quality police service to the people of our great nation, he added.\n\nI am so content with the contribution and service l gave to the country in pursuit of national goals and aspirations.\n\nIn attendance at the historic handover-and-takeover ceremony was Home Affairs Minister Kazembe Kazembe, State Security Minister Lovemore Matuke, CIO boss Isaac Moyo, Army Commander Anselem Sanyatwe and Air Marshall Jacob Nzvede.\n\nPrior to the Friday event, an organisation claiming to represent children of war veterans, COZWA, made sensational allegations that Matanga reported at his Harare offices in full police uniform arguing he was yet to receive official communication of his marching orders.\n\nCOZWA proceeded to make sensational claims that the polices Support Unit, Alpha Troop had been put on standby to forcibly remove him from office.\n\n",

            "content": "By Noel T Ngangira\n\nPut aside the recent political turmoil, Mozambique set in motion an energy juggernaut plan that left many African nations drooling in awe.\n\nLets rewind a bit. In 2023, energy exports from coal, gas, and electricity topped US$5.8 billion. Coal led the pack with $3.4 billion, followed by gas at $1.73 billion and electricity ($658 million). 80% of its electricity exports went to SA and 15.4% to Zimbabwe.\n\nWith 180 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves mainly in the Rovuma Basin off the coast of Cabo Delgado, Mozambique is only bettered by Nigeria (with 203 trillion cubic feet) in Africa. It ranks 14th in the world. Energy giants TotalEnergies (France), Exxon Mobil (USA), Eni (Italy) and CNPC (China) are the key LNG operators in Mozambique.\n\nCahora Bassa Hydro power station in Tete province has a power generation capacity of 2,075MW, and plans are underway to increase it to 4,000MW. The following hydroelectric power plants are also in the pipeline and will be online between 2027 and 2031: Mphanda Nkuwa, 1,500MW (Tete); Chemba, 1,000 MW (Sofala); Lupata, 650MW (Tete); and Boroma, 210MW (Tete). This is hydropower only; there is solar and thermal to boot.\n\nFor comparison, Zimbabwe generates about 1,500MW but has an installed capacity of about 2,240MW (hydro and thermal). According to the 2022 Population and Housing Census, 62% of Zimbabwes population has access to electricity  though its not mentioned how many hours per day was/is the electricity actually available.\n\nAccording to the International Trade Administration (ITA), Mozambique aims to achieve universal electrification by 2030. Significant strides to achieve this goal have been made. It moved from 34% in 2021 to 48% in 2022 in terms of population with access to electricity. With the investments made and the work in progress, energy for all is within reach for sure.\n\nThe Mozambican government plans an additional 14,000MW of green energy (hydro) between 2030 and 2040. In its energy transition strategy document, the government plans a whooping US$80 billion investment in the energy sector by 2050. Serious stuff!\n\nITA adds that Mozambique has the largest power generation potential of all Southern African countries. Power Africa estimates that the nation could generate 187 gigawatts (187,000MW) of power from coal, hydro, gas, wind, and solar.\n\nSources include Global Data, Club Mozambique, International Trade Administration (ITA), Power Africa, ADB COP28, and UNICEF.\n\nNoel T Ngangira writes in his personal capacity.

As I confuse thyself in the bars of the prison that is my mind.\n\nThis journey has been a tapestry woven with threads of trials and triumphs. Each moment a stitch in the fabric of the collective nation called GAFA, said Winky D.\n\nIn this tumultuous year, Winky D discovered flickers of joy amid the shadows. As the year 2024 drew to a close, he faced significant hurdles that threatened to overwhelm him.\n\nOne of the most challenging moments was losing his beloved venue, the Harare International Conference Centre (HICC), known affectionately as paJabuna, where he has hosted his iconic New Years Eve shows.\n\nDespite securing the place as early as May 2024, the venue was in a biased manner given to gospel musician Everton Mlalazi, who has strong ties to the Zanu PF acolyte Kudakwashe Tagwirei.\n\nThis unexpected setback was a heavy blow for the artist, who expressed, Amidst the tempest, we found flickers of joy and connection through music. Towards the end, I faced hurdles that overwhelmed my feeble heart.\n\nAnxiety gripped me as I pondered how to close this chapter on a high note, said the dreadlocked artist.\n\nThe loss of the HICC venue was described as sabotage, yet, amidst this uncertainty, a beacon of hope emerged as his loyal fans in the United Kingdom and Bulawayo embraced his last shows of the year.\n\nYour presence at my live shows in the UK and Bulawayo became the beacon of light during dark hours!\n\nDances on the edge of uncertainty, anxiety and excitement fought within me. But you, the Gafas, sang along. Hope flickered anew.\n\nYour unwavering loyalty and vibrant enthusiasm reminded me of the profound unbreakable bond we have shared over the years.\n\nBefore the HICC debacle, Winky D in 2023 faced a ban on State media over Eureka Eureka, only to be unbanned in 2024 according to NewZimbabwe.com sources.\n\nHowever, certain songs from Winky Ds Eureka Eureka album, such as Ibotso and Dzimba Dzemabwe, remain banned.\n\nDuring his 2023-2024 New Years Eve concert, Winky D acknowledged the impact of the blackout on his music.\n\nFrom 2004 up until 2024, 2023 was the most difficult year for me musically, said Winky D.\n\nI could not get an interview on the radio for the show. I only had the internet and dreams and then you (fans), he further said.\n\nAs the new year dawns, the GAFA, stands ready to embrace whatever challenges and triumphs await, thanking his fans for their love and loyalty towards him and his Vigilance Band.\n\nEach note I play and every lyric I sing is dedicated to you. Your energy fuels my creativity and commitment to our cause. Thank you for being my strength during these trying times.\n\nYour support transcends words; it is a lifeline that propels me forward. Together, let us carry this momentum into the new year, embracing both challenges and triumphs that might await us on the horizon.\n\nHappy Twenty Twenty Strive, he wrote.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nCELEBRATED musician Mukudzeyi Mukombe also known as Jah Prayzah has drawn widespread condemnation from his fans over his effusive praise for controversial tenderpreneur, Wicknell Chivayo, who has lately been gifting cars and cash.\n\nChivayo, known for his close ties to the ruling party, Zanu PF, and his dubious reputation as a tenderpreneur, the endorsement has raised serious ethical questions by Jahs followers over his post.\n\nIn a Facebook post dripping with adoration, Jah Prayzah referred to Chivayo as a blesser par excellence.\n\nBorn with an open hand that uplifts the orphans, the widows and less privileged. In front of you there are no strangers but only children of God, with this you are a blessing to this nation as we have never witnessed this huge kind of love.\n\nThe gifts you offer are received by those who accept them like the rains from God that suddenly pour down, and we cast our seeds into the ground, he said.\n\nWith such rhetoric, while appealing on the surface, is deeply misleading and raises eyebrows in a nation that has witnessed the detrimental impact of Chivayos business practices.\n\nHis tenure as a controversial businessman has often been marred by allegations of corruption, leaving many Zimbabweans questioning his integrity, and leaving the country bleeding.\n\nBootlicking Jah Prayzah himself last year received lavish gifts from Chivayo, including a $180,000 Mercedes Benz S500 becoming the most expensive car gifted a musician in the country.\n\nFollowing the recent Harare shutdown show in November, his female dancers were also gifted with Toyota Aquas, and he was also given an additional $20,000.\n\nThe fans in his Facebook comment section have pointed at serious concerns about whether his rosy lifestyle has clouded his judgment and led him to overlook the troubling realities of those he claims to uplift, as they are seen as people who already have a background to work on their own but are the ones mostly benefitting from Chivayos unquestionable source of income.\n\nJah Prayzah also posed troubling questions, Do you think blessings would fail to multiply through the hearts of many you have pleased? Do you think they would fail to love you for your goodness or for your excellent deeds? Do you think that even God Himself would fail to add blessings on top of others? Out of respect for you, we give you honor; your dignity will forever be associated with your name. Your actions increase the glory of Gods goodness, said Jah\n\nThe award-winning artists praises to Chivayo have alienated the very fans who have supported him through thick and thin, many of whom are disillusioned by the rampant corruption that has plagued their lives.\n\nBELOW IS JAH PRAYZAH SHONA STATEMENT CONVERTED TO ENGLISHYou were born with an open hand that uplifts the orphans, the widows and less privileged. In front of you there are no strangers but only children of God, with this you are blessing to this nation as we have never witnessed this huge kind of love.The blessings that you get from the heavens, along with your hard-earned money you get from your own sweat, that you pray and fast for, you also give to others.You are like a large river that when it overflows it shares its waters to other rivers.Like a tree that, when it bears fruit, it drops some to sustain animals, birds, and humans.The gifts you offer are received by those who accept them like the rains from God that suddenly pours down, and we cast our seeds into the ground.Your name has not been raised through insults, criticism, or by belittling the spirit of others. Those who know you recognize you by your generosity like Kupakwashe Scott Sakupwanya, without an endless giving from a spring that never runs dry.Do you think blessings would fail to multiply through the hearts of many you have pleased? Do you think they would fail to love you for your goodness or for your excellent deeds? Do you think that even God Himself would fail to add blessings on top of others? Out of respect for you, we give you honor; your dignity will forever be associated with your name. Your actions increase the glory of Gods goodness.Everything you plan with your efforts may it succeed, may you be added with more wisdom because it enhances wealth through unification and reconciliation.May your health be preserved because it is the primary wealth. Continue to wipe away the tears of people because those are the blessings you have received. Happy new year to you, my brother Sir Wicknell.\n\nBELOW IS JAH PRAYZAH SHONA STATEMENT CONVERTED TO ENGLISH\n\nYou were born with an open hand that uplifts the orphans, the widows and less privileged.
