Quite a bit, it turns out.\n\nThe Competition and Tariff Commission (CTC) wants the government to slap a 40% safeguard duty on imported toothpaste, saying the flood of cheaper imports is crushing the countrys only local producer, Merken.CTCs investigation, whose results are published in the latest government gazette, found that toothpaste imports more than doubled, up 124%, between 2021 and 2023. That spike came after government lifted duty on imports.Shipments jumped from 1.2 tonnes in 2021 to 2.7 tonnes last year. The result? Merkens market share was squeezed from 2.04% in 2020 to below 1% in 2023, while its capacity utilisation dropped to just 3.39%.The imported products, mostly from South Africa, were up to 40% cheaper than Merkens, above being far more recognised brands than Merken.CTC says this damaged Merken: Other potential factors, including currency volatility and electricity supply challenges, were examined and found not to have materially contributed to the injury.So what did? The Commission points to two main factors, the lifting of import restrictions, and a weak South African rand, which made South African toothpaste even cheaper on Zimbabwean shelves.Its a story that many manufacturers in Zimbabwe will be familiar with; local producers face high costs, and must compete with South African producers, with larger capacities and benefitting from the rand.

Tagarira, Tawanda Mutangambiri, Bethel Princess Chiyangwa (USA), Donald Mdlongwa, Nonthantha Mangonya, members of the Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ) who have since relocated to the UK.Also included on the list is a former school headmaster Denver Mauwa. Others are Dadirai Mukwedeya, Shamiso Moyo, Ettar Patience Mhlanga and Bonisile Nyoni who are based in IrelandSecurity officials reportedly also expressed particular interest in Shepherd Yuda, a former whistleblower who now broadcasts critical content via live streaming platforms. His online materials will be reviewed in detail as part of ongoing counter-intelligence operations.Meanwhile, within Zimbabwe, FAZ presented a separate list of opposition figures affiliated with Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) aligned with Jameson Timba who are also under surveillance.Photos of diaspora activists participating in recent protests ahead of Auxillia Mnangagwas aborted visit to the UK were reportedly presented during the session, fuelling further discussions on intensified data collection and surveillance.The meeting reportedly concluded with officials committing to supercharged efforts to gather intelligence through digital monitoring of WhatsApp groups, social media, and activist platforms.Security officials are said to have requested additional funding towards the political strategy ahead of plans to extend Mnangagwas presidential term beyond the constitutional two five-year term limit.\n\nConfirmed by a senior government source, the crackdown was discussed during a recent high-level security meeting amid growing concerns over external criticism of Zimbabwes leadership, including First Lady and Health Ambassador Auxillia Mnangagwa.\n\nAccording to sources familiar with the meeting, names of targeted individualsmany of them activists, union leaders, and exiled professionalswere read aloud by members of Varakashi, an online pro-government mobilisation unit, and representatives of the Forever Associates Zimbabwe (FAZ), a shadowy group known for its grassroots intelligence operations.The government reportedly views these individuals as part of a broader campaign to tarnish the image of a sovereign State through media, forums, and international gatherings an act described by a Cabinet minister as illegal and intolerable under Zimbabwean law.There are people who think they can attack the image of our nation with impunity while hiding in foreign lands.Let them know that the law follows them, and they will face consequences when they set foot back in Zimbabwe, said the top government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.Among those named during the closed-door meeting were several high-profile Zimbabwean exiles including Mellisa T.
