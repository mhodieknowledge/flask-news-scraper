            "content": " says Parliament has received reports and proposes lifestyle audit\n\nBy Leopold Munhende\n\nTHE Chairperson of Parliaments Portfolio Committee on Budget, Finance, and Economic Development, Energy Mutodi has made sensational claims that Finance Ministry Permanent Secretary George Guvamatanga is getting kickbacks of as much as US$200,000 from government contractorsso asto facilitate payments.\n\nAccording to Mutodi, Parliament received complaints about how Guvamatanga has been managing affairs, and further alleged that he was demanding kickbacks from other ministries and government departments of between 5% and 10% for every treasury disbursement.\n\nMutodi claims Guvamatangas loot now exceeds US$1 billion and adds onto an empire that includes several mansions and 5,000 dairy cattle.\n\nThe Parliament of Zimbabwehas received agonising reports that Guvamatanga is receiving 5%-10% for every payment done by the Treasury. GG as he is notoriously called has accumulated more thanUS$1 billion becoming the richest civil servant, said Mutodi.\n\nContractors, Ministries and Departments refusing to pay Guvamatanga a kick back of at least 5% after receiving Treasury payments have been denied payments for several months even if the funds are budgeted for.\n\nOver the past six months, Parliament itself has struggled to operate after being denied its budgeted funds by George Guvamatanga. A civil servant earning less than $1000 GG has more than 5000 dairy cattle, dairy equipment and several mansions hence the proposed lifestyle audit.\n\nOnecontractor Bitumen which was contracted to do roads has been asked to pay US$200,000 byGuvamatangafor every $2,000,000 weekly payment he authorises that theyreceive and they have made several complaints tomembers of the Budget Committee at Parliament.\n\nGuvamatanga was earlier this year accused of receiving bribes from shadowy businessman Wicknel Chivayo to approve payments to the controversialRen-Form CC, a South African company that supplied Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) with voting material at highly inflated prices.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa is said to have fired and forgiven him in June this year before he begged for the job he has kept since 2018.\n\nAZanu PF Member of Parliament (MP) for Bikita South, Mutodiclaimed Guvamatanga had made threats to deal with him if the committee was to ever seek a lifestyle audit or engage the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC).\n\nHe added: Guvamatangahas also made threats to senda terror team to deal with the(me)upon hearing that the Committee was considering carrying out a life audit on him as well as asking for a ZACC probe.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nMembers of a self-styled African tribe have been evicted from their camp on council-owned land in the Scottish Borders.\n\nThe three people, who call themselves the Kingdom of Kubala, have been staying in a wooded area near Jedburgh.\n\nThe tribe streamed the eviction live on TikTok on Thursday morning. It showed a man and a woman being led from the camp by uniformed officers.\n\nThe group had previously said they were reclaiming land that was stolen from their ancestors 400 years ago and refused to recognise the powers of the courts to evict them.\n\nA convoy of police, sheriffs officers and immigration enforcement officials moved into the camp at about 08:00. A police cordon had been in place since the early hours.\n\nDrone footage showed a long line of uniformed officers entering the camp before the detention of two members of the group was streamed on the social media feed.\n\nKofi Offeh, 36, a Ghanaian who describes himself as King Atehene, and handmaiden Kaura Taylor, from Texas, were handcuffed by immigration officers.\n\nIt is understood they have been arrested on suspicion of immigration offences.\n\nJean Gasho, 43, who is originally from Zimbabwe and calls herself Queen Nandi, left with her head covered, lying low in the back of a pick-up truck.\n\nThe cordon was lifted at about 10:00 when journalists were allowed back into the woodland.\n\nCouncil workmen could be seen dismantling the camp and throwing bags of blankets, clothes, food and drink into the back of a refuse lorry.\n\nMr Offeh and Ms Gasho first arrived in Jedburgh in the spring and they set up camp on a hillside above the town.\n\nThey were later joined by Ms Taylor, who calls herself Asnat.\n\nThe group have a large online presence, with more than 100,000 followers on TikTok and Facebook, and have received worldwide media attention.\n\nOn Wednesday, they were banned from moving back to private land they had already been evicted from, at a hearing at Selkirk Sheriff Court.\n\nLast week, the court granted an order banning them from any council land in the area, including where they had been staying.\n\nJedburgh and district councillor Scott Hamilton said he was very much relieved by the eviction.\n\nIt has been a long effort by the local council, police and other services to achieve this outcome, he said.\n\nIt is the absolute right outcome today. The locals have had to put up with a great deal with this.\n\nHe added: This is an industrial estate. There are businesses operating from here  they have been put under a huge amount of pressure over the last few months.\n\nWe have had to work through the courts and the law process and that does take its time but ultimately we have achieved the right outcome.\n\nBBC Scotland reporter Cameron Buttle, who was at the scene of the eviction, describes what he saw:\n\nI arrived this morning just after 06:30 and the police cordon was already in place.\n\nWe were kept well back from the piece of woodland the group had named the Kubala Kingdom. The authorities wanted everyone well back as they moved in.\n\nJust before 08:00 a convoy of cars and vans swept through the cordon and on down to the woods.\n\nA local man had his drone up, I joined the crowd and watched the screen to see the police, immigration officers and sheriff officers file along a path into the trees.\n\nThen a shout from a woman on her phone, one of the group was live streaming from inside the camp as the authorities moved in.\n\nEveryone was then glued to their screens watching events unfold.\n\nEventually we were allowed down to the woods. Inside the campsite was bare, rows and rows of black bin bags with the groups belongings spilling out.\n\nThere was nothing left of their Kingdom of Kubala.\n\n",

            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nOutspoken former legislator Temba Mliswa has sensationally declared businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei as President Emmerson Mnangagwas natural successor, dismissing Vice President Constantino Chiwengas chances of ever taking over.\n\nIn a leaked audio of a phone conversation between Mliswa and controversial businessman Agrippa Bopela Masiyakurima, secretly recorded by the latter, Mliswa argued that Chiwenga is being misled by his wife, Miniyothabo Baloyi, into believing he still commands enough military influence to claim the presidency.\n\nMliswa, once a fierce critic of Tagwirei, defended his change of stance by insisting he has no permanent enemies but only permanent interests.\n\nThe person who is going to take over from Mnangagwa is someone he trusts, who will protect his interests, Tagwirei, said Mliswa.\n\nSocial media does not install a leader. To tell you the truth, I know how you feel about Mnangagwa but we cannot have permanent enemies, we should have permanent interests. Who does not eat, everyone is doing so.\n\nWalk with the father who is there, not a step-father. Chiwenga is a stepfather. We will lose deals because of things that do not matter, you are business people, you must look at things that make you money.\n\nBoth Masiyakurima and Mliswa appeared to agree on Tagwireis succession prospects, with Masiyakurima adding that he could never support Mnangagwa because of a failed US$5 million business deal between them.\n\nMliswa accused Chiwenga of corruption and pursuing personal vendettas, even over trivial issues such as unreceived wedding gifts.\n\nOnce considered the most powerful man in Zimbabwe after leading the November 2017 military intervention that toppled the late Robert Mugabe and ushered in Mnangagwa, Chiwenga is now widely viewed as having lost influence since retiring from the army to assume the role of deputy president.\n\nDespite perceptions that the military has shifted allegiance to the MnangagwaTagwirei faction within Zanu PF, Chiwenga reportedly still believes he retains significant sway.\n\nAdded Mliswa: There is no longer any opposition in Zanu PF, they are headed to a conference with Mnangagwa tightly holding onto power, there is no coup that will ever happen in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe cars that were given to the military came from Tagwirei with Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) Commander Phillip Valerio Sibanda saluting, remember Valerio is from ZIPRA, not ZANLA.\n\nChiwenga will never direct operations for the army, that will never happen. He removed his uniform. That man is being misled by his wife, he should remember that he no longer wears a uniform.\n\nBaloyi, a serving Colonel, has in recent months stepped up her public presence, which analysts view as part of both her own rebranding and that of the Chiwenga family. This comes as the Mnangagwa administration continues to face criticism over alleged corruption, ruthless tactics, and an expanding grip on key economic sectors such as mining.\n\n",

If you are receiving this video, it means that we have been intercepted and have been abducted by the state of apartheid Israel, he said. I call you to request our government to exert pressure for my immediate release.\n\nThe South African group of the flotilla has condemned the interception of its vessels by Israeli occupation forces in international waters, describing the attack as a deliberate attempt to block humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nDelegates aboard the flotilla, which included South African civilians, were reportedly detained and faced drone and water cannon attacks.\n\nIn a statement, the Global Sumud Flotilla (GDF) confirmed that the Israeli occupation forces ambushed the Global Sumud Flotilla in international waters, detaining some of the delegates and attacking the vessels with drones and water cannons.\n\nThese actions represent yet another attempt to silence voices of solidarity and to prevent even the smallest lifeline of relief from reaching Gaza. This is illegal under international law, the GDF said in a statement.\n\nThe organisation emphasised that the flotillas mission was purely humanitarian and peaceful.\n\nThe GSF was carrying civilians committed to drawing attention to the devastating conditions faced by Palestinians. Their mission is peaceful. Their objective is humanitarian. Their interception exposes once more the reality that Gaza is held under siege not only by walls and checkpoints, but by warships, drones, and policies of isolation.\n\nThe GSF called on the South African government to act immediately to ensure the safe return of its citizens.\n\nThe Global Sumud Flotilla  RSA demands the immediate and unconditional release of all the delegates with full access to their lawyers, and for Israel to respect all international laws and measures governing the protection of civilians and humanitarian missions, the unhindered delivery of the humanitarian aid, and the lifting of the siege that continues to strangle Gaza, they said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chrispin Phiri, spokesperson for the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco), emphasised South Africas call for restraint and adherence to international law.\n\nSouth Africa wishes to reiterate, in the strongest terms, its call for all actors to adhere strictly to international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and relevant international humanitarian law principles, he said.\n\nPhiri stressed that the safety and security of the flotillas participants, includingSouth African citizens, are of paramount importance.\n\nThe safety, security, and physical integrity of all unarmed participants aboard the Flotilla, including South African citizens, are of paramount importance, he added.\n\nHe warned that any military engagement or forceful detention of the vessels in international waters would constitute a serious breach of international norms. Phirifurther highlighted the peaceful and humanitarian mission of theflotilla.\n\nIt must be underscored that the Flotilla is a civilian-led initiative, embarked upon a peaceful and humanitarian mission. Its participants aim to draw attention to the severe and urgent humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people in Gaza and to deliver vital aid to alleviate the widespread suffering, Phiri said.\n\nOther South Africans who are part of the mission include Fatima Hendricks, Zaheera Soomar, Zukisa Wanner, Reaaz Moola, Bashera Soomar and Carolyn Shelver.\n\nFormer Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi shared his support of Mandela. \n\nMandla Mandela! Selfless brave soul. You make us eternally proud Madiba. Strength to the Sumud Flotilla, Free Palestine, he said.\n\n",
