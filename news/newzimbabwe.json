            "content": "By Sports Reporter\n\nThe Zimbabwe senior mens national football team held its first training session in Durban on Monday afternoon ahead of Fridays FIFA World Cup Qualifier against South Africa at Moses Mabhida Stadium.\n\nThe session included both locally based and South Africa-based players, who make up the majority of the squad. Team captain Marvellous Nakamba, who plies his trade in England, joined camp later in the evening, while other European-based players are expected to arrive on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe clash carries more than just qualification hopes; national pride and regional bragging rights are also at stake in this long-standing rivalry.\n\nZimbabwe, who sit bottom of Group C with four points, are already out of contention for World Cup qualification, while South Africa remain in the hunt, sitting second with 13 points, nine ahead of the Warriors.\n\nMeanwhile, Bafana Bafana have suffered a major setback after key player Relebohile Mofokeng was ruled out due to injury.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference on Monday, South Africa coach Hugo Broos confirmed that Kaizer Chiefs midfielder Mduduzi Shabalala has been called up as Mofokengs replacement.\n\nWe replaced him with Shabalala. Second, there are two players who have not arrived because they played yesterday , thats (Lyle) Foster and (Sphephelo) Sithole. They will arrive tomorrow (Tuesday) morning, and in the afternoon, we will be complete, said Broos.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA 50-year-old Nyabira man has appeared in court for culpable homicide after his six dogs attacked and killed a girl, who was on her way home from school.\n\nGift Jambaya of St Mannocks Farm, Nyabira in Mashonaland West, appeared at Chinhoyi Magistrates Court on Monday and was remanded in custody for continuation of bail ruling. The State is opposing bail.\n\nThe circumstances are that on September 30, 2025, the accused person left his place of residence and left his six cross-breed dogs unattended.\n\nThe court heard that, as the now deceased Caroline Charity and other pupils walked past the homestead on their way home from school, the canines chased and attacked them. While the other children managed to flee, the victim was mauled to death by the dogs.\n\nHer body was later discovered with multiple deep cuts and teeth marks.\n\nThe National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) argues that letting dogs run loose is not merely a nuisance but is a failure of the owners duty of care, which is a criminal offence.\n\n",
