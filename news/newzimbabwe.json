            "content": "By Dr Richard Dune\n\nWhy continuous professional development must be a core part of governance, not just a box-ticking exercise\n\nIn the world of regulated care, whether its adult social care, primary care, education, or early years, theres one word that gets mentioned during every inspection, audit, and workforce review:Continuing professional development(CPD).\n\nBut what exactly does CPD mean for providers regulated by CQC, Ofsted, or local authorities? Why is it so often the missing link between poor inspection outcomes and outstanding governance? And how can digital tools like ComplyPlus help organisations embed CPD into daily practice rather than scramble for certificates before inspections?\n\nIn this article,Dr Richard Duneexplores why CPD should be treated as a compliance function, not a side project  and how integrating it into digital compliance systems, governance frameworks, and workforce planning can drive measurable improvements in care quality, safety, and leadership effectiveness.\n\nContinuing professional development (CPD) is the ongoing process of building and maintaining the knowledge, skills, and behaviours required to deliver safe, effective, person-centred care or learning support.\n\nIts not a single training session or a course to tick off before revalidation. True CPD is structured, continuous, evidence-based, and strategic.\n\nThe following are the core components of CPD:\n\nIn practical terms, CPD is how providers ensure their staff are competent, confident, and compliant, not just when inspectors arrive, but every day.\n\nHealth and social care operate in a fast-changing environment: new treatments, new legislation, and emerging technologies are constantly reshaping how care and education are delivered.\n\nWithout regular, relevant training, staff quickly fall behind, placing organisations at risk of:\n\nAcross England and other regulated jurisdictions, CPD is not optional. Its embedded in multiple laws, standards, and frameworks.\n\nThe following are the key laws, inspection standards, and professional body requirements that make continuing professional development a legal and regulatory necessity:\n\nIn regulated environments, incomplete or disorganised CPD records are one of the most common reasons for enforcement action or inspection failure.\n\nAfter a recent episode of ourComplyPlus Presentspodcast, many providers asked: What counts as legitimate CPD? The answer is simpler than you think:\n\nIf an activity is relevant to your role, has learning outcomes, is evidenced, and reflected on  it counts.\n\nBelow are some of the valid CPD activities that are accepted by regulatory and professional bodies:\n\nThe following activities do not count as valid CPD activities:\n\nWhen CPD is approached strategically, it fits into a wider governance and compliance cycle, monitored through atraining management system(TMS) or other regulatory compliance software.\n\nThe following are the six-step CPD governance process:\n\nWhen tracked digitally, this process becomes seamless, transparent, and inspection-ready.\n\nGone are the days of filing cabinets and spreadsheet trackers. With cloud-based regulatory compliance software, providers can now:\n\nUsing tools likeComplyPlusLMS and TMS, providers can stay fully compliant while reducing admin burdens and improving accountability.\n\nOne of the biggest misconceptions is that CPD only applies to nurses, doctors, or teachers.\n\nIn reality, every frontline care worker, early years practitioner, or support staff member needs ongoing development to stay competent and compliant.\n\nThe following are the core topics for all health and social care staff:\n\nCQCandOfstedinspectors expect role-specific training records for all staff, not just those on professional registers.\n\nFrom our experience working with hundreds of providers, here are the most frequent issues:\n\nTo make CPD a strength  not a liability  organisations should:\n\nWe developed the ComplyPlus CPD Tracker after seeing how many providers were:\n\nBelow are the key features of ComplyPlus CPD tracker:\n\nHere are the key benefits in using the ComplyPlus CPD tracker:\n\nCPD is no longer optional.

The complainants indicated that the three had informed them that they were heading to the game reserve, but strangely, they never returned, said Mdhluli.\n\nInvestigating police officers took the complainants and headed to the game reserve.\n\nAt the game reserve, police officers were informed by officials that certain individuals frequently gain entry into the premises without authorization.\n\nFurther information indicated that, about a week ago, there were some people that were noticed at the game reserve, but (the trespassers) fled upon noticing the authorities and were never seen again, said Mdhluli.\n\nPolice officers then continued with their investigations around the premises, and noticed three bodies floating in the Nkomazi River.\n\nThe SAPS team from search and rescue, as well as divers, were summoned to the scene. The three bodies were retrieved from the river, hence an inquest case is being probed in order to establish the cause of death, said Mdluli.\n\nPolice said a postmortem will be conducted, and the identities of the three men will be shared in due course, once their next of kin are notified.\n\nPreliminary investigation by the police has thus far revealed that the men are originally from Zimbabwe, said Mdhluli.\n\nMeanwhile, acting provincial commissioner of SAPS in Mpumalanga, Major General Zeph Mkhwanazi has since ordered a thorough investigation into the shocking incident to unveil the truth of what has actually transpired, leading to the death of the three individuals.\n\nEarlier this month,IOL reported thatAsher Watkins, a millionaire from the United States of America, was gored to death by a buffalo he was hunting in Limpopo.\n\nThe 52-year-old hunter had reportedly paid Coernraad Vermaak Safaris around R177,221 for the trip in which he planned to stalk and kill wild animals in the expedition.\n\nIt is with deep sadness and heavy hearts that we confirm the tragic death of our client and friend Asher Watkins from the USA. While on ahuntingsafari with us in Limpopo province, Asher was fatally injured in a sudden and unprovoked attack by an unwounded buffalo.\n\nAmerican millionaire Asher Watkins poses wth one of his kills before the tables turned on him and he was gored to death by a Cape buffalo during a hunting trip. Image: Asher Watkins/Facebook\n\nHe was tracking it together with one of our professionalhuntersand one of our trackers. This is a devastating incident, and our hearts go out to his loved ones, said the safaris Hans Vermaak in a statement.\n\nThe safari said Cape buffalo have some of the most fearsome reputations on the planet.\n\nResponsible for several deaths and many injuries to hunters each year, the buffalo is regarded as the most dangerous animal to pursue in Africa, let alone the world, the safari said on its website.\n\n",

When news initially broke that TV and radio presenter and DJ Lerato Kganyagos husband had acquired a mall, of course, curiosity was piqued.At the grand opening of Ndlala Mall, one finally laid their eyes on Ndlala Mall, previously called Sterland Mall.The white building in Arcadia, Pretoria, is hard to miss, located on a corner for all to see. Renovations are underway to the centre that was once a popular mall that attracted movie goers.Hosting a major event for the first time comes with plenty of stress, anything can go wrong and the first night of Ndlala Malls grand opening was not without mishaps.Guests arrived at the arena to find it beautifully decorated in black and gold, with an area for VVIP guests, who got to enjoy a delicious but cold meal.The diamond package promised ticket-holders bottomless Dom Perignon but one woman was left flabbergasted when she only got one glass and was given Veuve Clicquot. However, French champagne is champagne though.Water is one of lifes ultimate necessities, but sadly guests were once again left speechless, when they ordered water and the service staff told them, neither still or sparkling water was available.Actress and media personality Khanyi Mbau was the MC for night one of Ndlala Malls grand launch.Guests finally entered the arena and the soft R&B sounds played, the mood began to lift and laughter started to fill the air. Excitement filled the room when actress and media personality Khanyi Mbau entered the stage to MC the launch.Mbau, a Dubai resident, made sure to lift the crowds spirits, as she did the dance challenge in her name, announcing her arrival.Musician Langa Mavuso proved to be a fitting opening act, as he warmed up the audience for what was to come.The arena proved to be an amazing venue for live experiences, as when Joe Thomas entered the arena, no sound or technical issues were in sight. The award-winning musician performed his classic hit songs that hit home with many of the attendees making them forget any inconvenience they encountered.To the end of his performance, Thomas brought Ndlala on to the stage to thank him for bringing him to perform and giving him his first star, which is placed on the entryway of the mall. The two have formed quite the friendship with Thomas calling him a friend and as the Americans say brother.Ndlala proved to be a man of a few words when put on the spot and simply thanked guests for attending and supporting the occasion.A few celebrities were spotted from Londie London, Zari The Boss Lady, Buhle Samuels, Blue Mbombo and Lerato Sengadi.Night two of the Ndlala Mall opening had American singer Donell Jones headline and Vusi Nova as supporting acts and Somizi Mhlongo as the MC.\n\nAfter dazzling audiences at the Womens Day Concert, Thomas extended his stay to perform at the grand launch of Ndlala Mall.\n\nNdlala Mall is owned by businessman Thami Ndlala.
