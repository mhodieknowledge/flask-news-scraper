Its the start of a new chapter.\n\nThe bridge has a high-speed glass elevator that can send visitors to a coffee spot 2,600 feet above the river. Visitors can also try bungee jumping or a 1,900-foot-high glass walkway.\n\nThe province of Guizhou, which is home to about 40 million people, has undergone an infrastructure campaign in recent decades as part of theChinese governments war on poverty. It now has more than 32,000 bridges that are either completed or under construction, compared with about 2,900 in the 1980s.\n\nGuizhou is also home to what is now the worlds second-highest bridge, Duge Bridge, which opened in 2016.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has overturned a ruling that had awarded damages to six Rusape councillors who sued the town council for malicious prosecution, finding that the council never instigated their arrest and that their claims for legal fees and lost business were unsupported.\n\nJustices Sijabuliso Siziba and Isaac Muzenda allowed Rusape Town Councils appeal and dismissed the councillors claims, which had each been pegged at US$7,500.\n\nThe court a quo erred in finding the appellant liable for the delict of malicious prosecution, ruled Justice Siziba. There was no evidence that the council, as a legal persona, took a resolution to set the law in motion against the respondents. Without such resolution, the council cannot be said to have instigated prosecution.\n\nThe case stemmed from a 2020 tender row over the provision of legal services. The six councillors Lyton Sithole, Elizabeth Chidza, Joseph Nyamupera, Ndabaningi Mataga, Preference Chigwede and Peter Kwesha were arrested and charged by the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) with criminal abuse of duty after the tender was cancelled.\n\nHowever, at their criminal trial, State witnesses, including then Acting Town Secretary Fansen Shuwa, cleared them of wrongdoing, testifying that they had not been part of the committee handling the tender. The councillors were acquitted at the close of the States case.\n\nIn 2023, the six sued the council for malicious prosecution, demanding US$40,000 collectively in damages. The magistrates court later awarded them each US$5,500 for legal fees and US$2,000 for lost business opportunities.\n\nThe High Court said those awards had no evidentiary basis.\n\nMalicious prosecution requires more than merely reporting a case to the police, Justice Siziba said. A party can only be found liable if it acted in a manner that tended to overbear on the police to institute proceedings which they would not otherwise commence. That was not the case here.\n\nThe court noted that ZACC had independently approached town officials and obtained statements while the councillors were away, with no council resolution authorising or directing such action.\n\nOn the issue of damages, the judges stressed that special damages must be strictly proven. No receipts were produced to show that any payment was made to lawyers, Justice Siziba wrote. It was a misdirection for the trial court to rely on the Law Society tariff in the absence of proof of actual payment.\n\nThe judges also dismissed the claims for lost business opportunities as unsubstantiated.\n\nThe councillors victory in the lower court has now been nullified. Rusape Town Council will not be liable for any damages.\n\nIn the result, we found merit in the appeal by the appellant and thereby upheld the appeal, the judgment concluded.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has revised the sentence of a commuter omnibus driver, ruling that a magistrate had gone too far in imposing a lifetime driving ban across all vehicle classes following a reckless driving conviction.\n\nRuzvidzo Freedom was convicted in June 2025 of reckless driving after he drove a Toyota Hiace kombi into oncoming traffic at the intersection of Second Street Extension and Upper East Road, Harare. Though no accident occurred, the trial court jailed him for two years and prohibited him from driving vehicles in classes 2, 4 and 5 for life, cancelling his licence entirely.\n\nOn automatic review, Justices Esther Muremba and Munamato Mutevedzi upheld the two-year mandatory jail term but blasted the blanket lifetime prohibition as a misdirection in law.\n\nThe trial magistrates decision to prohibit the accused from driving classes 2, 4, and 5 for life without distinguishing between the vehicle involved in the offence and other classes was therefore excessive and ultra vires, the judges ruled. Imposing a lifetime driving ban across all classes of motor vehicles on a first-time offender is a measure so severe that it should be reserved only for exceptional circumstances.\n\nThe court found that the magistrate had misapplied Section 53 of the Road Traffic Act, which provides escalating penalties based on repeat offences. For first-time offenders, the law prescribes a mandatory two-year minimum sentence plus a lifetime ban only from driving commuter omnibuses or heavy vehicles, not light motor vehicles.\n\nDriving against oncoming traffic signifies utter recklessness.\n\nBut apart from that, the magistrate must have noted that the offender was not involved in any accident, and there were no aggravating factors such as injury or damage. The degree of recklessness remained at the base of the recklessness ladder.\n\nThe High Court also warned magistrates against arbitrary prohibitions. A magistrate who plucks a prohibition from nowhere commits a gross irregularity which vitiates their decision.\n\nThe High Court reduced the lifetime ban to six months for light vehicles (Classes 4 and 5), while confirming that Freedom remains barred for life from driving commuter omnibuses (Class 2).\n\nHis licence was cancelled accordingly.\n\nThe judges ordered the trial magistrate to recall the offender from prison and formally advise him of the corrected sentence, ensuring the Registrar of Road Traffic Licences makes the proper amendments.\n\n",

            "content": "By James Muonwa\n\nCARBON Green Investments (CGI) has expressed commitment to implement its suspended Kariba REDD+ Project on forests conservation and community support in Zimbabwe.\n\nThis position follows endorsement by Verra, which is the global carbon credits regulatory body, acknowledging that the status of retired Kariba REDD+ credits will not change, and remain valid in their registry, meaning previously purchased credits also stay valid notwithstanding the baseline reassessment.\n\nThe carbon project owner says it welcomes Verras report, which it will scrutinise together with officials from the Government of Zimbabwe.\n\nCGI thanks Verra for providing its update and results from their review of the Kariba REDD+ Project, as outlined in their September 23, 2025, letter and public statement, said GCI in a statement.\n\nIn response, CGI, in collaboration with the Government of Zimbabwe, will carefully review Verras outcome. To ensure a thorough, true, and accurate outcome, CGI has concluded independent third-party assessments of the carbon accounting and related matters, using all up-to-date data, scientific findings and appropriate methodologies. From this evaluation, CGI will partner with the new registry to address and mitigate any historical discrepancies in credit issuance, prioritising transparency and the long-term sustainability of the project.\n\nWe value Verras role in trying to advance environmental integrity and looks forward to constructive dialogue as we move forward.\n\nCGI remains committed to the Kariba REDD+ Projects mission of forest conservation and community support in Zimbabwe. We are grateful for Verras input and are committed to continue working towards resolutions that uphold the highest standards, the company said.\n\nAmidst the positive outlook, GCI issued a weeks ultimatum demanding from Verra the baseline assessment report and data sources for the Kariba REDD+ Project review.\n\nWhile we appreciate the update on the carbon accounting and quality control processes, we are concerned by the lack of accompanying detail regards the basis for the reported findings, wrote CGI in a note dated September 25, 2025.\n\nAs the project proponent, we are committed to engaging constructively and transparently with all stakeholders involved, the company further said, before demanding the baseline reassessment report and data sources.\n\nFurther, GCI requested a freeze on the compensation process and interfering with its clients without the companys prior consent.\n\nThe ultimatum comes in the wake of concerns by Verra that there was over-crediting of carbons for the Kariba REDD+ Project, which some environmental analysts have questioned.\n\nIn an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Phillip Mutemachani said Verra was shooting itself in the foot by stating alleged over-crediting Kariba REDD+ Project carbon credits.\n\nMeanwhile, carbon asset developer, South Pole, has also added its voice on the saga of Verras Section 6 review into the Kariba REDD+ Project.\n\nAlthough South Pole has ceased all involvement with both project and the project owner since 2023, we have cooperated with Verra, a global carbon standard body, through every step of this review, which we see as an important process to give everyone, including South Pole and its various stakeholders, more clarity and guidance on the projects status and future.\n\nThe integrity and robustness of the buffer pool mechanism remain intact to manage any potential emissions reversals in the project.\n\nIn its past role as carbon asset developer, South Pole has consistently applied Verras VM0009 methodology as it pertains to carbon accounting, South Pole noted in a statement.\n\nIn normal circumstances under Verras VM009 methodology, any discrepancy between projected and actual deforestation (i.e. after a periodic assessment of the baseline as outlined in the methodology itself), would be corrected in subsequent verification periods.\n\nHowever, given the unprecedented situation of the project withdrawing from the Verra Registry, there are no subsequent monitoring periods where such compensation could occur. Verras update confirms that the carbon standard body is now taking proactive, corrective steps to balance credit issuances in lieu of the correction that would have otherwise been applicable as per the in-built true-up mechanism in VM0009.\n\nAlongside South Poles wider cooperation as part of the review, South Pole has proactively requested that Verra cancel the 2.5 million verified Kariba REDD+ credits South Pole holds to help address the discrepancies in issued credits and uphold the environmental integrity of the project.\n\nThis contribution builds on South Poles concerted efforts over the last two years to undergo a comprehensive transformation, which included a full review and strengthening of the companys quality, risk, and compliance protocols. The company introduced stricter KYC and partner diligence processes to ensure project partners align with our ethical and compliance standards.\n\nAs a carbon asset developer hired by the project owner, South Poles past responsibility was to ensure that Verras VM0009 methodology was being consistently applied as it pertains to the carbon accounting of the project, in order to receive verified carbon credits.\n\nIn addition, it managed the sale of carbon credits to the market in order to secure funding for the projects operations on the ground, but responsibility for operating the project on the ground  including engagement with and distribution of funds to local communities and initiatives  has been with CGIs local partner Carbon Green Africa (CGA).\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans living in the diaspora. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back, Mr Madzima. We understand that you are a speaker at the UK-Zimbabwe Business Expo, scheduled for October 24, 2025,in Birmingham. We want to pick your brain on multi-jurisdictional trade and investment by thediaspora, although we understand that you are going to speak in more detail at the conference. In your view, does the citizenship affect how their investment is treated or play any role?.\n\nVM: Thank you\n\nIt is common knowledge that a significant number of our diaspora community have taken up different citizenship or nationalities. It is also commonly accepted that the taking up of such citizenship was mainly on economic grounds and for ease of movement. Our recent history, coupled with sanctions imposed on the country, has limited economic growth and made it extremely difficult for Zimbabweans to travel and fully express their economic potential in Zimbabwe and across the world.\n\nThat being said, our constitution permits citizens by birth to hold dual citizenship. Dual citizenship has the same benefit as if the holder is a local with Zimbabwean citizenship only. Citizens by registration are generally restricted from holding dual citizenship.\n\nWe also have as part of the diaspora community, citizens who acquired citizenship of other countries before the current constitution of 2013. These members of the diaspora community could not hold dual citizen and had to renounce their Zimbabwean citizenship, in most instances, unwillingly.\n\nThis community may, if they so wish, make applications for restoration of citizenship in terms of the new Act.\n\nIt is worth pointing out, however, that in terms of our ZIDA Act, foreign investors must be accorded the same treatment as domestic investors and must not be treated less favourably. Provisions in our law that favoured local citizens,for example as contained in the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act, have been suspended and superseded by the ZIDA Act\n\nReporter:What will the diaspora investor need to qualify for protection under the ZIDA Act and what protections does it offer?\n\nVM: The Diaspora investor will be required to register the investment with the Zimbabwe Investment Development Agency. Registration may be made by a foreign or citizen investor.\n\nThe aim is to ensure that the investment benefits from statutory protections.\n\nTo the foreign investor, such registration affords the investment protection from nationalisation or expropriation. This is key for the foreign investor, as our country suffered bad publicity in this area. Should there be any expropriation for a public purpose, the investor is assured of quick and adequate compensation.\n\nI however, think that for the diaspora investor, the key protection has to do with the ability to repatriate capital and profits. This area has been a thorn in the past.\n\nWhat is required is that the investment is registered, capital flows through official channels like banks and the profits, dividends and capital may be inversely repatriated through authorised channels like the banks after payment of local taxes.\n\nReporter: Having opted to invest in the country, what are the best vehicles for the diaspora to house their investment in?\n\nVM: To a legal mind like myself, the words limited liability have a certain appeal to them. With that in mind, am inclined to recommend that the opening of a private limited company or a private business corporation, as they shield the acts of the company from the other personal wealth of the investor.\n\nOnly in extreme cases do our courts pierce the corporate veil to make the members of a company liable for the acts of the company.\n\nShould the investor already be operating another similar business in a different jurisdiction, they may consider opening and registering a branch in Zimbabwe, with the head office being located in a different jurisdiction.\n\nReporter: Because of our time, may you kindly explain what happens if a diaspora dies with different properties in different jurisdictions?\n\nVM: Well, this really depends on whether or not the diaspora had a will. In terms of our laws, all immovable property is governed by the laws where the property is situate, and all movable property is governed by the law where the deceased was domiciled at the time of death. An estate registered in another country with letters of administration of that country may be recognised and registered in Zimbabwe, subject to compliance issues.\n\nIt is worth noting that wills have to be compliant with Zimbabwe law formalities, and property that is not governed by a will may be subject to our intestate laws.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have to end here, because of our time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nhttps://www.tickettailor.com/events/zido/1546892\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",
