Further, they wrapped US$5,200 in a plastic bag containing meat and put it in a fridge compartment.\n\nThe court heard that Calvin and his gang had on May 15, 2024, broken into an unnamed complainants house and stole the cash.\n\nThe fugitive suspect shared the loot with his parents before fleeing to an unknown destination.\n\nThe court found both parents blameworthy for knowingly assisting in concealing the whereabouts of stolen funds.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nFINANCE and Investment Promotion Minister, Mthuli Ncube has extended South African wheeler-dealer Zunaid Motis African Chrome Fields national project status, allowing it to import 13,95 million litres of diesel duty-free up to December 2026.\n\nThe company was granted the national project status a decade ago, meaning it can procure fuel and machinery duty-free, a decision which raised eyebrows. Back then it could import 12 million litres duty-free and the extension to 2026 allows it an additional 1.95 million litres.\n\nMoti made headlines in 2023 after an independent investigation exposed a US$120 million chrome scandal involving President Emmerson Mnangagwa, his deputy Constantino Chiwenga and local tycoon Kuda Tagwireyi.\n\nAccording to the investigation by the Sentry organisation, the deal was struck on November 17, 2017, during the week-long coup that brought President Mnangagwa and Vice President Chiwenga to power. The Sentry is an investigative and policy organization that seeks to disable multinational predatory networks that benefit from violent conflict, repression, and kleptocracy.\n\nThe report made revelations that Moti paid $3 million to firms linked to Mnangagwa and Chiwenga following the signing of the chrome deal.\n\nKnown for his addiction to fast cars and cigars, Moti, dabbled in property development and private jets, but his main business in Zimbabwe was processing chrome.1 In 2014 he bought 70% of African Chrome Fields (ACF) and in 2015 applied for national project status which was granted that same year.\n\nRELATED:\n\nThe notice on the duty waiver was rubber-stamped by the Finance and Investment Promotion Minister, Mthuli Ncube under the countrys Customs regulations.\n\nIt is hereby notified that the Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion has in terms of Section 235 as read with Section 120 of the Customs and Excise Act made the following regulations.\n\nThe Customs and Excise Suspension Regulations, 2003, published in SI 257 of 2003 are amended in section 9 BB as follows- in subsection 2 by the deletion of the words 1stJanuary 2023 to 21stJanuary 2024 and substitution with the words 1stJanuary 2025 to 21stJanuary 2026; approved beneficiary of power generation projects eligible for suspension of duty, read SI6 of 2025.\n\nThe development comes at a time when the Civil Society has castigated some Chrome miners for leaving behind a trail of destruction after tapping into the countrys underneath.\n\nZimbabwe is home to some 19% of global chrome ore reserves  the second largest in the world. Its chrome store is also of a higher grade than other international sources, with an exceptional chrome-to-iron ratio of 2:1.\n\n",

It is also not in dispute that the property they owned was in both their names and that it was sold for US$65,000.00.\n\nIn my view even if the court accepts that they were not in a business partnership, he cannot escape this obvious reality that she owned half of what they considered the marital home.\n\nBy registering the property in both names she obtained a half share.\n\nAlso, since there was no business partnership in the strict sense of that word relating to his cell phone business, the loan to Anita had nothing to do with the plaintiff.\n\nHe could not have used her half share of the proceeds from the sale of the property in which he owned half of it, to cover his own business loan.\n\nHe owes her US$32,500.00, ruled the judge before ordering Naison to pay the amount over a period of six months or such period as the parties may agree between themselves in writing.\n\nThe court heard the couple fell in love in 2013 and started living together the following year.\n\nKadiyo told the court that she gave birth to their first child in 2015 and stopped going to work.\n\nParties agreed to start a joint venture, selling mobile phones, the court heard.\n\nKadiyo said she contributed US$500 to this effect.\n\nShe said they obtained a US$35,000 loan from one Anita based in China which they paid within a month.\n\nThe couple according to Kadiya would make around US$7,000 everyday from their sales.\n\nShe would occasionally go to the shops when her husband was away on business trips as she was saddled with the responsibility of looking after a young child.\n\nThey then bought a stand in Haydon Park and started building up to the roof level whentheydecided to sell the house.\n\nShe also testified that at the time of their separation in 2023, they had cell phone stock worth US$40,000.00.\n\nKadiya had claimed US$20,000.00 as her half share of that stock but she did not have proof to that effect.\n\nIn his evidence, Naison denied that they had a business partnership.\n\nHe denied that she had ever given him US$500.00 to order more stock.\n\nNaison said the plaintiff knew of his business as a wife but that this did not make her a business partner.\n\nHe however admitted that they had bought a stand, which had been put in both their names.\n\n",

In 2024 alone, USAIDs funding to Zimbabwe amounted to approximately US$360 million, supporting a wide array of programmes spanning health, agriculture, and governance sectors.\n\nIn a January 27, 2025 notice to grant recipients, Andrea M. Plucknett, USAID Zimbabwe supervisory agreement officer, said recipients of funds must immediately suspend activities.\n\nDear implementing Partner: Effective January 24, 2025, the Agreement Officer hereby issues an order for the recipient to immediately suspend performance under the agreement your organisation was awarded by USAID/Zimbabwe.\n\nThe recipient shall take all reasonable steps to minimize the incurrence of costs allocable to the agreement during the period of award suspension, wrote Plucknett.\n\nRELATED:\n\nMain grant recipients and sub-grantees were also instructed not to resume work under agreements entered into with USAID until there is communication to lift the suspension.\n\nThe recipient shall not resume work under this agreement until notification has been received in writing from the Agreement Officer that this award suspension has been cancelled, further wrote Plucknett.\n\nAlso, all diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) initiatives being undertaken in Zimbabwe have been stopped.\n\nAll DEIA activities under all ongoing awards are to cease immediately. In light of the above, please have your authorised representative certify that any DEIA-related activities have completely ceased.\n\nThe Trump administration has moved to stop the supply of lifesaving drugs for HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, as well as medical supplies for newborn babies, in countries supported by USAID around the globe.\n\nAccording to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Trump administrations three executive orders targeting DEIA initiatives take a shock and awe approach that upends longstanding, bipartisan federal policy meant to open doors that had been unfairly closed.\n\nIn his first few days, Trump is undertaking a deliberate effort to obfuscate and weaponise civil rights laws that address discrimination and ensure everyone has a fair chance to compete, whether its for a job, a promotion, or an education.\n\nWith these actions, the administration is not only undoing decades of federal anti-discrimination policy, spanning Democratic and Republican presidential administrations alike but also marshalling federal enforcement agencies to bully both private and government entities into abandoning legal efforts to promote equity and remedy systemic discrimination.\n\nTrumps executive orders undermine obligations that firms doing business with the U.S. government and receiving billions in public dollars are held to the highest standards in remedying and preventing bias.\n\nACLU says for decades, federal policies have supported efforts to promote equal opportunity, enforced by administrations from both parties.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nICT Minister Tatenda Mavetera is facing a firestorm of criticism for leading a provocative song targeting Acting President General Constantino Chiwenga. This dramatic scene unfolded yesterday at the National Heroes Acre in Harare, exposing the deep fault lines within Zanu PF.\n\nMavetera, who formed the Young Women for ED group ahead of the disputed 2023 elections, was seen in the stands leading her group in a song with the lyrics: mupanduki mupanduki nguva yakwana, chera mwena which translates to traitor, traitor, your time is up.This song, like a dagger aimed at the heart, indirectly accused Acting President Chiwenga of being a traitor.\n\nThe burial of national hero Justin Mupamhanga became a stage for open Zanu PF infighting, much to the embarrassment of the party and government.\n\nThe division was evident: two groups in the stands, as different as night and day. One group, dressed in pink Young Women For ED t-shirts and led by Mavetera, clashed with another group sharing space with soldiers.\n\nMaveteras group also waved faux crocodiles in the air, a display of loyalty to President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nThese supporters of Mavetera clashed head-on with the other group, who loudly praised Chiwenga and sang in his support, with the refrain: siyanai naye Chiwenga munovengerei or leave Chiwenga alone, why do you hate him?. This pro-Chiwenga group grew even more fervent every time Chiwenga spoke against corruption  their support, like a tidal wave, building with each denunciation.\n\nNtokozo Msipha, Secretary-General of the General Chiwenga Voluntary Supporters Association, stated that Mavetera had crossed the line, calling her actions at the national shrine not just reckless but provocative.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday morning, Msipha said: Hon Minister, you have crossed the line. This must never happen again. Let this statement serve as a final warning. Discipline, respect and loyalty are the cornerstones of leadership. Those who fail to uphold them will find themselves on the wrong side of history.\n\nLast week, during the burial of three other national heroes, Chiwenga himself had described disrespect as a mortal sin which he said cannot be forgiven on earth and in heaven  a pronouncement now hanging over this conflict like a dark cloud.\n\nClive Malunga, a staunch critic of the Mnangagwa 2030 agenda and a veteran of the liberation struggle, told NewZimbabwe.Com that Mavetera was a disrespectful and a Mnangagwa bootlicker who has neglected her duties, focusing instead on pleasing one man over the needs of the country.\n\nThe calibre of ministers that we have in the current government are just bootlickers and they are always bent on pleasing an individual over the citizens of Zimbabwe. Mavetera should stop that kind of 1950s politics. She should concentrate on her ministry and constituency, Malunga said, his words dripping with disdain.\n\nPolitical analyst Lazurus Sauti, a lecturer at the University of Zimbabwe, said that Mnangagwas cabinet was not formed on merit basis.\n\nMost, if not all, public office holders are not chosen based on merit. So, they lack knowledge on how to formulate policies that can transform our economy in many respects. Mavetera is a prime example. She was busy at the national shrine dancing kongonya dissing political opponents instead of promoting ICT policies, he added, his tone critical.\n\nAttempts to get a comment from Minister Mavetera proved unsuccessful, with her mobile phone going unanswered.\n\nZanu PF spokesperson Farai Marapira distanced the party from Maveteras actions.\n\nYoung Women for ED is an affiliate of the party Zanu PF and it is an independent juristic person therefore it has its own structures that speak and defend on its own behalf. I speak on behalf of the party, Marapira said.\n\nThis event has thrown the simmering tensions within Zanu PF into sharp relief, revealing a party divided and struggling to contain its internal conflicts. The political stage is set for more drama as the rival factions continue to threaten tear each other apart.\n\nSocial media was set ablaze this morning, as many erupted with a cacophony of commentary and fervent debate surrounding Maveteras conduct at the National Heroes Acre yesterday.\n\nThe incandescent display of factionalism at the hallowed grounds of the national shrine has spurred a maelstrom of reactions, with many suggesting that the minister should perhaps commence preparations for an expeditious departure from Zimbabwe.\n\nThese voices, fuelled by historical precedent, posit that her exit strategy should mirror the abrupt exoduses of Professor Jonathan Moyo and his coterie of G40 kingpins who fled the nation during the tumultuous Operation Restore Legacy in 2017.\n\nThis military-led intervention forced the resignation of the late President Robert Mugabe, leaving key loyalists to his wife, Grace Mugabe, under the G40 banner scrambling for sanctuary in disparate locales beyond the borders of Zimbabwe.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nZimbabwean beer brewer and soft drinks maker, Delta Corporation, has flagged the prohibitive operating environment and currency instability obtaining in South Africas northern neighbour, arguing that policy changes were occasioning challenges that rendered operators uncompetitive and supply chains ineffective.\n\nOver the past few weeks, retail and wholesale companies have been closing down in Zimbabwe as they bulk under the heavy saddle of currency instability. The Zimbabwean government enforces that formal companies also take the local unit of exchange for purchases while informal players mostly trade in US dollars, leaving retailers at a disadvantage.\n\nThe operating environment in Zimbabwe remains complex, influenced by policy changes and currency instability. The beverages sector faces further challenges relating to uncompetitive retail prices arising from high input costs and taxes which attract lower priced imports from the region and policy driven changes to the route to market, said Delta Corp secretary, Faith Musinga.\n\nDelta Corp cited fluctuations in exchange rates, disruptions in utilities supply (electricity and water), and varied consumer spending patterns during the traditional summer and festive peak period as the key developments that marred the operating environment during the quarter period to the end of December 2024.\n\nDuring the period under review, Delta managed to lift lager beer volumes by 4% over prior year same period. This was despite some disruptions to supply arising from prolonged water and power outages.\n\nInterestingly, demand remained firm and this had resulted in some mismatches in the supply of key brands and packs. The uplift in lager beer volumes was a consequence of the companys recent investments into capacity.\n\nDelta Corps sorghum based opaque beer volume for Zimbabwe grew by 2% for the quarter, but declined by 2% for the nine months compared to prior year.\n\nVolumes for the companys sparkling beverages (that includes brands such as Coca-Cola, Fanta and others) declined by 16% during the quarter compared to prior year.\n\nThe volume loss is attributed to the impact of sugar tax-induced price increases and the surge in imports from the region, explained Musinga.\n\nThe sectors competitiveness was affected by the relatively high sugar tax and cost differentials, leading to an increase in imports of similar offerings from neighbouring countries.\n\nZimbabwe introduced a sugar content surtax in January 2024.\n\nMusinga further said that the exchange rate disparities that dogged the quarter contributed to pricing misalignment in the formal sectors while the tight liquidity conditions that prevailed during the quarter resulted in sub-optimal stocking patterns in key retail channels.\n\nGroup revenue for the quarter only marginally increased by 1% compared to prior year and grew by 7% for the nine months. The company said this reflected the mixed volume performance across its business units.\n\nPart of the revenue increase in soft drinks was also related to the sugar tax induced price increases.\n\nNonetheless, the proportion of sales in US dollars varied month-to-month in response to the exchange rate and changes to the route to market but remained above 70% for the year.\n\n",
