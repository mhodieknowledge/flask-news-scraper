            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nFormer Finance Minister Tendai Biti has called for a forensic audit and a judicial commission of inquiry into the controversial US$114 million cost of the newly commissioned Trabablas Interchange in Harare.\n\nThe infrastructure project, unveiled by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, has attracted public outrage following disclosure by Treasury that it cost more than triple what similar infrastructure costs in the region.\n\nBiti has described the reported amount as a financial black hole, alleging that public funds are being siphoned off under the guise of national development.\n\nAccording to Biti, the project should not have cost more than US$40 million, raising concerns over transparency and accountability in public spending.\n\nThe Trabablas Interchange should not have cost more than US$40 million. Now the Minister of Finance goes to Parliament and says it cost US$114 million. A forensic audit must be carried out. A Judicial Commission of Inquiry must be conducted, Biti told a local publication, 263Chat.\n\nThe former minister said three key issues must be probed: the actual cost of construction, the procurement process, and the authenticity of expenditures.\n\nWhere are the bills of quantities that reflect the true construction costs?\n\nThe true costs of construction need to be verified and established through an independent process that produces separate and independent bills of quantities,he said.\n\nBiti also questioned whether public procurement laws were followed in awarding the project to Fossil Contracting, a company owned by businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei.\n\nWas the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Act complied with? On what basis was the contract awarded to Fossils Tagwirei consortium? he asked.\n\nFossil is linked to several high-value state contracts, with Tagwireis name consistently associated with controversial tenders and opaque government deals.\n\nThe businessman previously ran the Command Agriculture programme through Sakunda Holdings, a company that reportedly received over US$3 billion in state funding.\n\nThe figures surrounding those deals have never been fully accounted for, raising ongoing concerns about accountability and governance.\n\nBiti further raised doubts about the funding sources for the interchange. Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube stated in Parliament that the project was partly financed through Zimbabwes Special Drawing Rights (SDRs) from the International Monetary Fund.\n\nBiti pointed to Section 298 of Zimbabwes Constitution, which governs public financial management. It mandates transparency, accountability, and equitable resource distribution, particularly to marginalised groups and regions.\n\nThe people deserve to know how their money is spent. Projects of this magnitude must not only serve national development but must also reflect integrity, fairness, and value for money, Biti said.\n\n",

There are four things we are trying to do in NRZ, with what we have on our track, which is our rail, with the working ones, with the locomotives, and the signalling, and all what we are doing there is to show that the rail will fix the questions on the rail, on the track, and the one that is done, its working good, working perfectly in time.\n\nWe have been doing this, and we are happy that at least we are now seeing a turnaround in all these entities, said Mangudya.\n\n",

            "content": "By A Correspondent\n\nLONDON: With its signature mix of music, community, and cultural pride, Zimfest returned, drawing huge crowds and delivering memorable moments.\n\nAfter two decades, the festival is no longer just a nostalgic gathering for the diaspora, instead, its become a cultural bridge, particularly for second-generation Zimbabweans finding their roots.\n\nA generational shift\n\nPerhaps Zimfests most powerful triumph this year wasnt on the main stage or in a headline set  it was in the faces of its crowd. The youthful demographic was impossible to miss. Teens and twenty-somethings arrived in droves, draped in flags, dancing with pride and curiosity, reconnecting with a Zimbabwe some of them have never physically known. That energy is priceless, and it positions Zimfest as more than an event but a cultural inheritance.\n\nTawanda Chiwira (OLY), spokesperson for Zimfest, said: This event has never just been about the music, its about creating a space where Zimbabwean culture can be experienced at different levels.\n\nWhat really stood out this year was the energy from the younger generation. Seeing them take ownership of the experience, thats what its all about. We want Zimfest to feel like home, like something youre proud to be part of. That connection doesnt stop when the music does, its something were building annually.\n\nWere also continually listening to feedback because while no festival is without its challenges, every concern is an opportunity to improve. Our goal is to give everyone the best possible experience, year after year, and to keep making the festival a true home for Zimbabwean culture in the UK.\n\nSonic innovation: Amapianos takeover\n\nThe Piano Republik stage, back by popular demand, was easily one of the weekends standout attractions.\n\nAmapiano royalty DJ Maphorisa and Young Stunna turned the popular red tent into a memorable experience for fans, with a massive audience moving as one to the beat of this South African genres global rise.\n\nIt wasnt just a series of performances; it was a cultural moment, one that reaffirmed Zimfests ability to tap into pan-African trends while keeping a Zimbabwean heart.\n\nStar power and rising stars: Zimbabwes music scene on full display\n\nVeteran performer Busi Mhlanga made a powerful return to the Zimfest stage, bringing a wave of nostalgia with her.\n\nWith her signature sound and iconic stage presence, she transported the crowd back to the golden era of Zimbabwean music, offering a soulful nod to the old-school while reminding everyone why she remains such a respected figure in the industry.\n\nHer set was more than a performance; it was a moment of homage to the foundation she helped lay for the next generation. In a lineup filled with rising stars, Busi stood tall as a reminder that timeless talent never fades.\n\nSaintfloew took to the stage with the confidence of an artist who knows hes arrived. His journey from underground favourite to festival mainstay has been rapid, and his performance confirmed that the hype is well-earned. His growth was evident, not just in sound, but in presence and its clear this is only the beginning.\n\nRising stars Oriyano and Nisha TS brought their own flavour to the stage, with Nishas performance in particular standing out. It was a moment of real girl power, proving that female talent isnt just part of the story, its pushing it forward. Crowd-favourite Jah Signal lit up the stage with his trademark energy, keeping vibes high from start to finish.\n\nClosing the night with undeniable star power, Winky D once again proved why he remains one of Zimbabwes most commanding performers. A seasoned Zimfest favourite, he knows how to read the crowd and deliver  effortlessly moving from anthem to anthem with the charisma and energy of an artist who understands the stage as much as he does his audience.\n\nTogether, the lineup wove a rich tapestry of Zimbabwean sound, celebrating icons, welcoming new voices, and giving the diaspora a musical experience that felt both rooted and refreshingly current.\n\nThe Bottlenecks: bars, queues, and festival tweaks\n\nThe organisers clearly havent rested on their laurels. This years layout saw notable tweaks, most significantly, the relocation of the Sky Terrace. The move gave VVIP guests an improved view of the main stage and a better overall experience. These adjustments, while perhaps subtle to the casual attendee, reflect a responsive approach to festival curation.\n\nAs with any event of this scale, challenges surfaced. Bar queues were long at times, an issue not uncommon at large-scale festivals, regardless of how many service points are available. The event saw an impressive turnout, and at peak times demand tested capacity. However, all available bars were operational, and organisers have confirmed a review of their placement to better serve future crowds.\n\nUnexpected delays at departure\n\nDespite months of planning to ensure smooth transport, an unforeseen road traffic incident disrupted Zimfests otherwise well-executed exit strategy. As the headline acts wrapped up, a serious collision on a main route meant police had to close the road for nearly two hours, causing widespread delays and also limited taxi access. Despite this, the team handling traffic control acted quickly to implement an alternative plan, prioritising safety above all.\n\nA spokesperson for the onsite team said; Zimfest is a year in the making, involving 12 months of planning and close coordination with partners including local authorities, the police, and National Highways to ensure a smooth and safe experience for everyone.\n\nUnfortunately, the accident on one of our main exit routes and the resulting road closures prevented the swift transition we had planned.\n\nWhile some of these events were beyond our control, we sincerely apologise for the inconvenience and are grateful for the patience and cooperation shown by those who attended.\n\nA festival still worth celebrating\n\nDespite some online speculation from less established sources attempting to cast doubt on this years event, its worth setting the record straight. Contrary to speculation, no fines were issued to the organisers.\n\nZimfest ran in close collaboration with relevant authorities, and the crowds conduct over the weekend was far from the chaos some corners of the internet would have you believe.\n\nYes, a few questionable outfit choices may have made an appearance  as they do at any festival but they hardly defined the weekend. The overall event itself reflected the kind of pride and community spirit the festival is known for.\n\nWith thousands in attendance, this years festival upheld its reputation as a well-run, high-energy celebration of Zimbabwean identity in the UK. From Zimbabwes homegrown stars to cross-border powerhouses, from local vendors to global fans, Zimfest continues to evolve. There were a few bumps in the road and its imperfections may be real but so is its heart. And if the youth have embraced it, then its future is not just secure, its guaranteed.\n\nThis years event was supported by major international sponsors, including World Remit, Remitly, Ecocash, and Mukuru, alongside other key partners like Nyaradzo Life Insurance, Diaspora Insurance, Wiremit, Clear Mobitel Connect, My Hippo Store, Hello Paisa and Kumusha.\n\n",

South Africa had the advantage of having comparative access to capital as a white apartheid state. In colonial times, capital into Africa followed white, and South Africa has the biggest white population on the African continent. All those Western countries gave South Africa a certain edge in access to capital.\n\nWe in Zimbabwe/Rhodesia were second in terms of our white population. We also had comparatively better access to capital than any other African country, and we had migration of labour from Mozambique, Malawi, and Zambia into Zimbabwe.\n\nThe former Zimbabwean ambassador to the Peoples Republic of China said people follow where they see an advantage in terms of development and capital.\n\nNow things have changed. We are now having capital in a flat global world where China can supply capital, India can supply capital, Riyadh can supply capital, so we now have an Africa that is going to global markets, getting capital. That discrepancy in access to capital, which was the case for the colonial era, is beginning to disappear.\n\nYou cannot believe it, there is now a seamless environment between life in Zimbabwe and life abroad. That is why our diaspora is coming back to Zimbabwe, putting a lot of money  our diaspora feels at home, they are now beginning to invest at home. For your information, the biggest diaspora migration is white.\n\nHe said the white Zimbabweans who had fled the country at the onset of majority rule in 1980 make up a good number of the people moving back into the landlocked Southern African nation ruled by President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nSo the return of the white diaspora back to Zimbabwe is actually an indication that things are getting better in Zimbabwe. Remember we are operating the hardest currency in the world, the US dollar, and if you can make your economy succeed on the back of the US dollar, it means you are doing very well as a country, said theWar Veterans Association chairperson.\n\nSpeaking to IOL,Dr Alexander Rusero, head of the department of international relations and diplomacy at the Africa University situated in Mutare, Zimbabwe, said the landlocked country seemingly has its worst times behind it  economically and politically.\n\nI think in all fairness, Zimbabwe has had its bad tide and we are definitely past that in as much as the mess we were once in as a country is concerned. That explains why you hear an opposition voice. We are as good as not having an opposition in Zimbabwe, and if you want to look at Zimbabwes dynamics currently, just look at the balance of forces within Zanu-PF.\n\n",
