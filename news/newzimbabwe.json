            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nBusinessmen Moses Mpofu and Mike Chimombe have been found guilty of defrauding the government of US$7 million in a botched Presidential Goats Scheme tender.\n\nThe two, who have been in remand prison for over a year since their arrest in June last year. They return to court on October 31 for sentencing hearing.\n\nIn his ruling, High Court Judge Pisirayi Kwenda said the first accused, Mpofu, shot himself in the foot. He said all he did was in his capacity as a director and that he was directed to do so. So there was no further proof needed by the State.\n\nThe second accused argued that his case was strange because the State closed its case without mentioning how he was involved in the misrepresentation. His closing submission was that the State failed to bring him any closer to the case, insisting that he was implicated merely by association.\n\nKwenda said there was no basis for invoking the doctrine of association, as no law was cited.\n\nWe accepted the submission by the State that Blackdeck was not registered. Was the use of that name meant to deceive? Could it be said the intention was to bring perjury? We believe the name was used to attract some colour, not to deceive the ministry, although different names were used interchangeably, said the judge.\n\nKwenda noted that Mpofus failure to call witnesses affected his credibility and his defence.\n\nHe knew these witnesses were important as he was being charged in his personal capacity. His decision not to call these witnesses was his own, except that one witness had died,which was not verified by production of evidence, the judge said.\n\nWhere a litigant threatens to call witnesses to confirm his defence and later abdicates, the usual inference is there was no intention to call that witness, or that the witness, if called, would not confirm that defence.\n\nKwenda dismissed Mpofus explanation that he changed his mind after realising he was being charged personally, describing it as lame because he knew that from the beginning.\n\nHe explained that a company is a legal fiction: A company is just a person in terms of the law. Its really not a natural person created by God. It being a fiction, you cant touch it. It does not have a brain of its own, so its very difficult to separate the acts of a company from the acts of the person who represents it.\n\nKwenda said a corporate body might be liable, but the State may choose not to use the body. The fact that one is a director gives rise to that liability.\n\nHe added, Mpofu must have been aware of his obligation. He submitted a bid which contained falsified information, so which confirms that he was liable. He should have called witnesses to confirm that he was not involved in the submission, but he did not do so.\n\nKwenda said that where presumption gives rise to criminal liability, the onus is on a litigant to prove that he did not play a part.\n\nRegarding the second accused, Chimombe, the judge said: The second accused person strenuously denied he had much involvement in this scheme. We were faced with a situation where we had a threatened case against his denial. We must resolve that factual dispute, and that can be rectified by reference to the testimony of witnesses.\n\nThe witnesses, John Bhasera and Nhundurwa, said they would attend meetings together. We therefore found that he participated. We did not find his explanation convincing. If he said he attended meetings with Nhundurwa, that would have nothing to do with lobbying for an award for Blackdeck because it had already been awarded.\n\nKwenda rejected the claim that the second accused attended meetings merely to resolve disputes as a member of EEG. There was clearly another reason for this. Why would he be there to attend a business meeting?\n\nIt shows he had a mandate, said the judge.\n\nKwenda concluded: We found that the version of the first accused person,that Chimombe was co-opted to represent the company,is binding. To that extent, we found that the second accused was controlling the affairs of the entity. His liability flows from his participation.\n\nIn January this year, Kwenda, while turning down a bail application by the two business partners, said they risk being jailed for 20 years if convicted.\n\nRegarding the seriousness of the offence, I have looked at the penalty and the presumptive penalty for fraud is 20 years, Kwenda said then, adding that if a fraud involves public funds, the sentence will be severe.\n\nMpofu and Chimombedefrauded the Ministry of Lands of US$7 million after securing a tender using a non-existent firm, Blackdeck Pvt Ltd.\n\nThe two forged a ZIMRA Tax clearance certificate and a NSSA compliance certificate in the name of Blackdeck Private Limited and attached them to a bidding document which they submitted to the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Water, Fisheries and Rural Development for a tender for the supply and delivery of goats for the Presidential Goat Pass-on Scheme.\n\nThey misrepresented that the company was in full compliance with ZIMRA and NSSA requirements.\n\nActing on the misrepresentation, the Ministry of Lands contracted Blackdeck Private Limited and they were paid US$7 million.\n\nInvestigations later indicated that the QR code and the reference on the NSSA compliance certificate were issued to a different company. It was further established that Blackdeck Private Limited was deregistered from the NSSA system in January 2016. Further investigations established that Blackdeck Private Limited was not issued with a ZIMRA tax clearance certificate for the year 2021.\n\n",

You know, pre-season and the kind of players you recruit will determine how you play, said Mutasa.\n\nThese guys punched above their weight because, if you look at our depth compared to other teams, there is a huge difference. We tried as much as we could, but we only stretched this far.\n\nMWOS FCs promotion to the Premier Soccer League was confirmed in February 2025, barely a month before the new season began. The club had finished second to Scottland in the Northern Region Division One League, and secured its top-flight berth by purchasing ZPC Hwanges PSL status.\n\nMutasa said the team is now focused on winning the Chibuku Super Cup, aiming to cap off their impressive season with silverware.\n\nMWOS face Triangle United in the semi-finals of the tournament at Ngoni Stadium on Saturday. Victory would see them progress to the final, where they will meet either Dynamos or Highlanders.\n\nConsidering the efforts put in place by management and our fans, I think we will try as much as possible to win the Chibuku Super Cup, as hard as it might be, added Mutasa.\n\n",

He has been Minister since 1980 and he has been President, first completing the tenure of President Mugabe and the two terms that he has been given. He needs to be an ungrateful man to seek anything beyond that, said Mwonzora.\n\nAt the just-ended Zanu PF Peoples Conference in Mutare, the ruling party resolved to fast-track constitutional amendments that would allow Mnangagwa to continue his tenure beyond 2028.\n\nMwonzora said the country has seen no tangible improvement under Mnangagwas leadership, who took over from long-time ruler Robert Mugabe following the 2017 military coup.\n\nThere is nothing special that we have received from his presidency at all. Zimbabweans continue wallowing in poverty, although they say that there is economic development in Zimbabwe. Average Zimbabweans have become poorer. Some Zimbabweans cannot afford a meal a day every day and there is a lot of unemployment, so why should we have a term? said Mwonzora.\n\nAccording to a leaked corruption dossier allegedly authored by Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, Zanu PF is plotting to smuggle a document into Parliament titled the Breaking Barriers Initiative (BBI), which seeks to postpone elections and extend the tenure of the National Assembly until 2030.\n\nThe BBI is reportedly being packaged as a national stability project aimed at helping Zimbabwe move away from the toxic cycle of elections.\n\nMwonzora, however, warned against tampering with the 2013 Constitution, which was overwhelmingly endorsed by citizens in a national referendum.\n\nMDC was an active participant in the drafting of the constitution and it heard the views of the people of Zimbabwe. The people of Zimbabwe want a limited term. Somebody rules the country, is given a second term if possible, then they go home. So we remain opposed to the so-called 2030 agenda, he said.\n\n",

The move aligns with the funds strategy of securing high-quality, income-generating real estate assets supported by long-term, US dollar-denominated leases, a key driver for stable returns and capital growth.\n\nThe total acquisition consideration reflects the combined net asset value (NAV) of the target properties.

Addressing the gathering, she said the tragedy was not an unavoidable act of fate but the result of lawlessness and greed within the cross-border transport industry.\n\nThe victims  mostly Zimbabwean and Malawian nationals  were travelling home when the bus veered off the N1 North near Louis Trichardt on 13 October, killing 43 passengers and injuring 40 others.\n\nAccording to a technical report by the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC), the bus was operating without meeting roadworthiness standards, carried passengers beyond its legal limit and was travelling at an unsafe speed along a mountainous route. Ramathuba said such conditions made the tragedy not just an accident, but a crime against humanity.\n\nThe government will not allow lives to be lost due to greed, lawlessness and disregard for human life, she said. We condemn reckless driving, non-compliance with transport regulations, and the operation of unroadworthy vehicles. The law must take its course, and those responsible must be held accountable.\n\nLimpopo Premier Dr Phophi Ramathuba\n\nRamathuba also commended the emergency services and hospital staff who responded to the scene, saying their swift action saved lives under difficult and dangerous conditions. Our rescue teams risked their own lives to retrieve bodies and transport survivors to safety. Their commitment gave dignity to the deceased and comfort to the grieving, she said.\n\nThe Limpopo government has partnered with the diplomatic missions of Zimbabwe and Malawi to identify and repatriate the deceased. Forensic teams have completed postmortem examinations and begun DNA testing to ensure accurate identification of remains.\n\nFamilies of the victims were provided with counselling and logistical support as they began the painful process of identifying their loved ones.\n\nThe tragedy has reignited concerns over South Africas road safety record and the persistent operation of unsafe, overloaded cross-border buses. Transport experts and activists have long warned that weak enforcement and corruption in vehicle inspections allow dangerous operators to remain on the road, turning long-distance routes into death corridors.\n\nFor many families, the loss goes beyond the immediate grief  it also means the loss of breadwinners who had been working in South Africa to support relatives in neighbouring countries.\n\nEvery life lost on our roads is a blow to a family, a community, and to our shared humanity, Ramathuba said.\n\nAs the province continues to assist with repatriations and investigations, the premier urged all road users to prioritise safety and accountability.\n\nLife has no duplicate, she said.\n\nEvery journey must begin with responsibility. Let us not wait for another disaster to remind us of the value of a single human life.\n\n",
