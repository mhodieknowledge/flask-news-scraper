            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nA joint parliamentary report has laid bare conditions in Zimbabwes prisons, exposing chronic overcrowding, dilapidated facilities, inadequate basics, and inhuman treatment of inmates as the most critical challenges facing the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Service (ZPCS).\n\nThe Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee and the Thematic Committee on Human Rights found that most correctional facilities are operating at between 200% and 300% above capacity, with some holding more than triple their intended numbers.\n\nGwanda Prison was holding 210 inmates against a capacity of only 60, representing a staggering 350% overcrowding whilst Chikurubi Maximum Security Prison had 2,689 inmates crammed into facilities designed for 1,114 and Binga Prison had 78 inmates with the holding capacity of 45.\n\nSimilarly, Harare Remand Prison was overcrowded by over 50%, with 1,361 inmates held in a facility meant for 900. Bindura Prison reported 443 inmates versus its capacity of 393, and Marondera stood at 730 inmates for a space meant to accommodate only 358, read part of the report.\n\nThe report revealed that most prison infrastructure remains in a dire state, with many facilities constructed during the colonial era as far back as 1910 and never adequately maintained or expanded to accommodate the growing inmate population. This has led to cramped, unsanitary, and poorly ventilated conditions.\n\nOvercrowding has led to serious human rights and health implications, including inmates sleeping in cramped, poorly ventilated, and leaking cells, strained sanitation systems, insufficient bedding and increased risk of disease transmission, and limited access to healthcare.\n\nWhile commending government for improvements in food and nutrition,noting that inmates are now served three meals a day,the committee highlighted severe shortages of clothing and bedding, which compromise dignity and health, particularly during the winterseason.\n\nAt some prisons, the Committee found inmates wearing torn or worn-out clothes, with some relying on donations from relatives. Additionally, blankets were in critically short supply. Inmates were permitted to bring their own blankets due to a mismatch between inmate numbers and available bedding.\n\nThe report also described the state of prison healthcare as severely under-resourced, undermining the constitutional right of inmates to basic medical care.\n\nAll prisons, including Harare Remand, Hurungwe, Khami, Marondera, Chikurubi, Chipinge, and Gwanda, reported frequent shortages of medication, especially for chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and mental health disorders. In several instances, inmates were entirely dependent on relatives for the supply of essential medicines, with facilities like Khami and Chikurubi reporting dangerously low supplies.\n\nPsychiatric inmates were said to be particularly affected by the unavailability of medication, worsening their vulnerability.\n\nDespite the challenges, the committee noted that rehabilitation and reintegration efforts are gaining momentum within the ZPCS, with many prisons introducing vocational and academic training programmes,signalling a shift from a punitive to a correctional model.\n\nHowever, lack of digital infrastructure continues to hamper access to justice, with many inmates unable to follow up on appeals or trials due to lack of printing facilities and systemic failure of individuals held on remand for extended periods without trial.\n\nDuring a visit to Harare Remand Prison, the committee also witnessed instances of inhuman treatment of inmates.\n\nInmates were seen sitting on a wet floor, which had recently been cleaned, while Class D inmates, committee members were informed that some inmates had recently been beaten following the escape of two inmates from the prison.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nPOLITICAL analyst and former opposition party leader Jealousy Mawarire has accused former cabinet minister Jonathan Moyo of involvement in a plot to scrap the 2028 elections and extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas tenure.\n\nThe alleged plot is detailed in a blueprint document titled Breaking Barriers Initiative, which aims to amend Section 92 of the Constitution.\n\nAccording to Mawarire, the document will be smuggled into Parliament to set in motion plans to extend Mnangagwas rule.\n\nThat document talks about, it is an attempt actually, to legally, so to speak, extend the Presidents term of office by amending Section 92 of the Constitution. Section 92 states that the president is to be elected by all the registered voters in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe repeal of Section 92, which is being pushed by that document, would then result in a situation where the President would be elected only by Parliament. The thinking is that if that constitutional amendment goes through, it has the legal effect of ending the Presidents current term, said Mawarire.\n\nIn the build-up to ZANU PFs National Peoples Conference, which began on Tuesday, attention has been focused on last years Bulawayo resolutions, including the proposal to extend Mnangagwas reign.\n\nThis is despite the Zanu PF leader having publicly denied any ambition to rule beyond 2028, when his mandate expires.\n\nMawarire also claimed that a clique of influential businessmen is pushing for the document to be tabled to prolong corruption through state avenues.\n\nThis is motivated by criminality because the guy has accumulated a lot of wealth, and he knows that, along the way, there are issues to do with human rights violations that he wants to run away from, and this one is a very good cover for him to go for as long as possible.\n\nI am actually thinking this guy is pushing to die in office. If you look at 2035, how old will he be? A lot of people are not happy with how he is running the country, said Mawarire.\n\nIn a post on his social media account recently, Jonathan Moyo dismissed the allegations as baseless.\n\nBut first it would help to unpack the proverb itself, for its origins reveal a deeper truth. Far from literal, it stems from the grim reality of rabies: a suspected animal is often quarantined or euthanised to curb the spread of its disease, making the disease a perfect pretext for destruction. Though sometimes attributed to French or German roots, the proverb is universal, its a cautionary tale against false accusations as cover for harm.\n\nAt its core, the proverb delivers a twofold moral maxim: Beware of false accusations or pretexts for unjust actions. On the dark side, it warns against the toxic tendencies such as the kind of poisoning Zimbabwean politics today.\n\n",

            "content": "NotJustOK\n\nEvery once in a while, an artist comes along who makes you stop and listen. Theres something real in the music, something that moves you. Thats what happens when you hearSylent Nqos music, the Zimbabwean-Mozambican guitarist, singer, and songwriter making waves across Africa.\n\nBorn to a Mozambican mother and raised in Harare, Sylent grew up surrounded by music. His parents bought him his first guitar and a marimba set as a child, unknowingly setting him on a path that would later take him across the world. Today, hes known across the continent as The Guitar Sangoma, a name that captures the healing, almost spiritual power of his performances.\n\nI draw on a wide range of influences, Sylent says. From traditional African rhythms to contemporary pop and electronic sounds. But at the heart of it all, I just want to make something honest, music that speaks to people from all walks of life.\n\nThat philosophy runs through everything he does. His 2022 debut album, Sylent Treatment, introduced listeners to his distinctive mix of Afro-fusion, alternative, and electric soul, music that moves between celebration and introspection without losing its African soul.\n\nBefore the album dropped, Sylent had already made his mark internationally. In 2016, he became the first African ever to win Senior Solo Instrumental Grand Champion of the World at the World Championships of Performing Arts in Hollywood, a milestone for Zimbabwe and Mozambique. Three years later, he was named Best Alternative Musician at the Zimbabwe Music Awards, solidifying his place as one of the countrys most exciting talents.\n\nHis live performances are where the magic truly comes alive. With his band, The Noise Makers, Sylent has performed alongside UB40, Dr. Oliver Mtukudzi, Hugh Masekela, and Chiwoniso Maraire and played in countries as far apart as Norway, Italy, Egypt, South Africa, and Australia. Reflecting on those experiences, he recalls, Opening for UB40 and meeting Bra Hugh were moments Ill never forget. Bra Hugh spoke to me about African freedom and the role of artists in telling our stories. That conversation still guides me today.\n\nBut despite his travels, Sylents sound remains deeply grounded in the continent. His collaborations feature some of Africas biggest stars:DavidoandMr Eazifrom Nigeria, Jah Prayzah from Zimbabwe, Shatta Wale from Ghana, and DJ Cleo from South Africa. Each partnership highlights his versatility as a guitarist and composer, effortlessly blending styles while staying true to his roots.\n\nI dont like to be boxed in, he says. My music is African, but it borrows from everywhere from soul, rock, pop, even electronic music. I want it to feel inclusive and alive.\n\nEarlier this year, Sylent Nqo signed with Bridgenorth Music, a Harare-based record label. His partnership with Bridgenorth marks the next chapter in a career that continues to evolve, breaking new ground. As the Guitar Sangoma readies his new body of work, fans can look forward to a dynamic body of work, one that speaks to connection, healing, and the transformative power of art.\n\nNow, as he prepares for his next chapter, with a new project in the works and live shows planned across Africa, Sylent is stepping confidently into the continental spotlight. Those whove seen him perform describe the experience as transformative. My shows are a celebration of life, he says. Theyre about connection, the kind you feel deep down when rhythm and emotion meet. Everyone is welcome. Its about joy, love, and remembering who we are. Sylent Nqo sets his sights on conquering Africa.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has thrown out a bid by two Harare men accused of defrauding a woman of her US$250,000 house under the guise of a US$30,000 loan, ruling that their ongoing fraud trial must continue because there was a case to answer.\n\nJustice Joel Mambara last week dismissed an application for review filed by Leon Zvarevashe and Nyasha Mhuru, who had sought to overturn a magistrate Ethel Chicheras decision refusing to acquit them at the close of the States case.\n\nThe pair argued that the trial court had grossly misdirected itself by placing them on their defence despite what they called a complete lack of evidence.\n\nBut Justice Joel Mambara found that although the magistrate had misstated the legal test by saying a discharge is granted only in exceptional cases, the ruling itself was sound.\n\nStrictly speaking, the magistrate did err in suggesting that a discharge is granted only in exceptional circumstances, the judge said. However, her conclusion aligned with the substance of the law; there was a case to answer.\n\nZvarevashe and Mhuru are on trial for allegedly tricking complainant Debra Mullin into signing away her Hillside house in Harare, worth about US$250,000, when she believed she was signing a loan agreement.\n\nCourt papers show that in February 2023, Mullin and her daughter approached the two men seeking a US$30,000 loan. They were made to sign documents they thought related to the loan, only to later discover it was in fact an agreement of sale transferring ownership of the property.\n\nThe State alleges the pair unlawfully and intentionally misrepresented the true nature of the documents, causing potential prejudice of US$250,000.\n\nAt the close of the prosecutions case, the defence sought an acquittal, arguing that there was no proof of fraudulent intent and that the complainant had voluntarily signed the agreement. The magistrate dismissed the application, prompting the accused to approach the High Court seeking to halt the trial.\n\nIn his judgment, Mambara ruled that the magistrates decision did not amount to a gross irregularity warranting High Court intervention before the trial concludes.\n\nThe core allegation is that the complainant was deceived about what she was signing. On this point, the complainant testified unequivocally that she believed she was signing a loan agreement, not a sale, he said.\n\nIf a court believes that testimony, then a misrepresentation is established. There was evidence linking the applicants to the alleged fraud.\n\nThe judge said the complainants testimony, the signed documents, and evidence of partial repayments all pointed to a transaction that could reasonably be found to be a sham.\n\nHe said that mid-trial interference by the High Court is reserved for the rarest of cases.\n\nThis Court will not short-circuit the normal trial and appellate process absent a truly compelling reason, Mambara J stated. The magistrates decision was one a reasonable court could reach in light of the evidence.\n\nMambara concluded that there was no gross irregularity or injustice in the lower courts handling of the matter.\n\nThe alleged misdirection in articulating the test for discharge, while noted, did not result in any substantial miscarriage of justice, he ruled. The trial must proceed to completion, and the applicants remedies, if any, lie in the normal course of trial and appeal.\n\nThe application for review was accordingly dismissed, paving the way for Zvarevashe and Mhuru to either testify or exercise their right to silence when the defence hearing resumes.\n\n",

Losing so many lives in one incident is painful beyond words  We extend our deepest condolences to the affected families, including those in Zimbabwe and Malawi. We wish a full and speedy recovery to all survivors.\n\nDanny Jacob, the manager of DNC Bus Services, which operates the bus, said the 61-seater bus was two years old. He said it left Gqeberha on Saturday with 40 passengers and picked up other passengers in East London and other places along the route to make up a total of 58 passengers.\n\nHowever, Transport Minister Barbara Creecy said that in addition to the 42 who died, another 49 passengers were injured  six critically, 31 seriously and 12 slightly.\n\nJacob said, I want to clear the air on this issue. The bus was never overloaded, and everything was in order when it was travelling. This is the work of people with bad intentions who are taking advantage of the advent of social media to spread wrong information.\n\nIt should also be noted that the area where the accident happened is notorious for accidents. This is our second bus to have had an accident there, and there were also several buses, trucks and small vehicles that overturned there before. Our condolences go to the affected families. We will stand with the survivors and families of the deceased.\n\nBut relatives are unconvinced.\n\nEdith Mukuse, whose sister and sister-in-law boarded the bus in Gqeberha, said repeated attempts to get information from the company had failed.\n\nHer relatives worked on a farm in Patensie. She said what hurt most was that her many calls to the bus operator were fruitless, and she had to physically visit its offices at the Gqeberha Railway Station.\n\nA tearful Mukuse said the bus operators should update people through their WhatsApp channels. Her relatives, whom she did not want to name until they were located, were seasonal workers in Patensie.\n\nI never thought that such a disaster would happen to me, said Mukuse. What I want to know is the fate of my relatives. We depend on information from the bus operator, but it then baffles me if they fail to inform us. They keep saying they are busy compiling the passenger log.\n\nMy sister was building her house in Masvingo and had spent a lot of money buying equipment that she had. This means everything is lost. What will I say to her three young children?\n\nShe was the breadwinner, and things are made complicated now that we are failing to locate both of them. Why is the bus owner not updating us on the developments, and to also provide a passenger log so that they can dispel allegations that the bus had 91 passengers? They should at least show empathy and have a human heart by telling the truth.\n\nA Malawian national who came to check the whereabouts of his two friends also went home disheartened. He did not want to divulge his name, but said he would return to the office the next day.\n\nHe said, Theres nothing I can say about the behaviour of the bus operators except to demand transparency. The person at the office is just a lady who knows nothing. It seems they took away from the office the experienced people we normally see there. She has no helpful information at all. This is the time when they should put people with information at the front office. This kind of unprofessionalism should stop.\n\nThe man, who works in Seaview in Nelson Mandela Bay as a domestic worker together with his friends, said he gave them groceries and money to give to his parents in Lilongwe, Malawi.\n\nI dont care about the money and the groceries I gave them; what I want is to know about the whereabouts of my friends. We were working together, but they got an early leave and were to return at the end of November so that I would also take my annual leave.\n\nI only want to have the truth told about their welfare. I am receiving countless calls from their relatives in Malawi, and I dont have words to soothe them, he said.\n\nTichaona Mukandiona (24) was one of the survivors of the crash. On Monday, he said he had only realised earlier in the day that he was in hospital. He said he was unsure what happened as he had fallen asleep before the crash.\n\nI boarded the bus [in East London] on Saturday around 6pm. The bus was already full with passengers. I had no seat, so I had to travel the whole of Saturday night and part of Sunday while standing. As we were about to reach Louis Trichardt, I felt so tired that I had to sit on another passenger who was asleep.\n\nMukandiona, who was travelling to Harare, Zimbabwe, said the belongings and money he was travelling with  R2,500 in his wallet, a satchel and clothes  were missing.\n\nWillard Suwedi, a Malawian passenger, said the bus had a few empty seats when they left Gqeberha.\n\nThe bus got overloaded at East London, but the conductor kept on picking up other passengers as we travelled towards Gauteng. As we travelled towards Louis Trichardt, the driver stopped because he had discovered the bus had developed some faults, but he decided to continue with the journey, he said.\n\nSuwedi said the bus started to speed up after Makhado and the driver did not heed his pleas to slow down.\n\nHe said none of his family members was aware of what had happened to him and that he did not know where his belongings, including two mobile phones, were. He sustained multiple bruises all over his body.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa said, This incident is a tragedy for South Africa and our sister states of Zimbabwe and Malawi alike. This sadness is compounded by the fact that this incident has taken place during our annual Transport Month, where we place a special focus on the importance of safety on our roads.\n\nOur roads are also economic networks that bring the people of our region together across our national borders. We must do everything we can as road users, as transport operators, drivers and passengers to ensure that we stay safe and that we share our roads responsibly and with care for one another.\n\nForensic investigations into the cause of the crash continued on Monday, with the N1 near Ingwe Lodge closed for several hours as emergency services cleared the wreckage.\n\nZimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa issued a statement pledging to assist in the burial of Zimbabweans and to assist the injured.\n\nI have instructed the relevant government departments and agencies in Zimbabwe to extend state assistance towards the repatriation of the remains of Zimbabweans who perished in the accident, and to extend similar assistance towards the burial. In respect to the injured, the government will meet all hospital bills, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFormer Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) leader Nelson Chamisa said he will not participate in the 17 October planned protests against President Emmerson Mnangagwas government.\n\nThis decision, he explains, stems from the oppositions experience with the November 2017 military takeover. He says their involvement then served as a salutary lesson, teaching them not to become entangled in Zanu-PFs internal factional and succession battles.\n\nThis follows a call from ousted Zanu-PF Central Committee member Blessed Runesu Geza for a one-million-man march on Friday, aimed at protesting against Mnangagwa and his alleged corrupt cartel. Gezas accusations target a number of high-profile figures, including controversial business tycoons such as Wicknell Chivayo, Geo Pomona CEO Delish Nguwaya, Paul Tungwarara, and Kudakwashe Tagwirei.\n\nHowever, analysts suggest that the planned protest goes beyond mere accusations of corruption but points to a deeper succession war playing out between Mnangagwas faction and his deputy, Rtd General Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nChiwenga is the favourite to take over from Mnangagwa, with many believing he has been patiently waiting for his turn. Yet, his path is reportedly being obstructed by Mnangagwa loyalists, who are now calling for the incumbent to extend his term of office beyond the constitutional limit of two terms.\n\nThis echoes the experience of the opposition previously, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), as it was then known, which took to the streets in a protest that ousted former President Robert Mugabe from power, anticipating a role in a new government.\n\nThat hope proved to be short-lived. The MDC felt betrayed and used, having been abandoned by Zanu-PF and Mnangagwa himself shortly after Mugabes departure.\n\nResponding directly to calls for him and his supporters to join Fridays protests in Harare, Chamisa wrote, 2017 taught us a big lesson!.\n\nHe added that the root cause of the countrys problems lies in disputed elections, maintaining that until this issue is addressed, Zimbabwe will remain trapped in its socioeconomic and political challenges.\n\nIgnoring the 2023 stolen election is ignoring the root of our crisis. Anything that does not address the 2023 stolen election is a fraud and a waste of time. Corruption, capture, suffering  theyre symptoms of a disputed mandate and a contested government. Lets treat the cause, not the symptoms, Chamisa wrote on his X account Monday.\n\nChamisa still commands a considerable following among opposition supporters despite his resignation from the CCC in January 2024, which left the opposition in further disarray.\n\n",
