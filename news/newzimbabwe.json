            "content": "NZ Herald\n\nFormer Zimbabwe cricket captain Brendan Taylor is set to face the Black Caps just days after his three-and-a-half-year ban from cricket is lifted, according to reports.\n\nTaylor was handed the ban in 2022 for breaching the ICCs anti-corruption code after he admitted to taking money from match-fixers in India  but claimed he never fixed or manipulated games.\n\nHis ban officially expires on Saturday, after which he will be named in the Zimbabwe test squad to face the Black Caps, with the first test beginning on July 30, Cricinfo reports.\n\nThe 39-year-old has previously played 34 tests including leading Zimbabwe to a close defeat to the Black Caps in 2011, in which he scored a century in the fourth innings before the home side fell 34 runs short of victory.\n\nTaylor admitted he took money from match-fixers who tried to blackmail him into manipulating international games with a secret video of him using cocaine on a visit to India in 2019.\n\nEven though he took US$15,000 ($25,000) from the fixers, Taylor said he never fixed or manipulated games.\n\nTaylor said he was invited to India to discuss a sponsorship opportunity in October 2019. At a dinner with businessmen, he was offered cocaine and foolishly took the bait.\n\nThe following morning, the same men entered my hotel room to show me a video taken of me the night before doing cocaine and told me that if I did not partake in spot fixing at international matches, the video would be released to the public, Taylor said.\n\nTaylor said he took the US$15,000 from the men, who said it was now a deposit for him to fix and they promised him another US$20,000 ($33,500) once the fixing job was complete.\n\nTaylor took four months to report the incident to the ICC and accepted that was against crickets anti-corruption rules.\n\nThe Black Caps and Zimbabwe will play a two-test series with both matches taking place in Bulawayo.\n\nZimbabwe have already named a 16-man squad which includes four changes following a 2-0 series defeat to South Africa last month, with Ben Curran, Sikandar Raza, Roy Kaia and Tanunurwa Makoni joining the side. Cricinfo reports Taylor is expected to be added to the squad.\n\nTaylor told Cricinfo in March that he has been using facilities at an elite independent school in Harare, preparing for his return.\n\nI still want to play and I believe I could make an impact as a player, he said.\n\nI look at where Im at physically and mentally and if I didnt feel I could do it, I wouldnt bother. Givemore [Makoni, managing director of Zimbabwe Cricket] has really supported me on this. He sort of shut down the coaching role for now and said, Can you play and try to push yourself up until the 2027 World Cup? Granted Ill be 41 then but with sobriety, Im living my truest form.\n\n",

We keep importing mediocre coaches who cant measure up to the requisite level, wrote Mliswa after Benades appointment.\n\nTo prove his critics wrong, Benade guided Zimbabwe to win the 2024 Rugby Africa Cup, a historical achievement.\n\nThe former Old Hararians gaffer on Saturday led Zimbabwe to defend the title, becoming the first Zimbabwean coach to win the Rugby Africa Cup trophy back-to-back.\n\nSo important was the victory that it came with a 2027 Rugby World Cup qualification ticket.\n\nThe true magnitude of what has been achieved has not yet set in, to be honest.\n\nWe are obviously very proud of our group for the work that was put in and very happy that the vision we set out 18 months ago has become a reality, Sables coach Piet Benade told New Zimbabwe.com.\n\nZimbabwe last featured at a rugby World Cup in 1991, and Benades recent success saw him end the nations 34-year wait.\n\nThe 43-year-old gaffer has, however, hinted that the greater challenge of preparing for the World Cup is now his focus.\n\nWe knew we had to go out and do something special to change what has happened for 30 years.\n\nWe hope that this will inspire and give the belief that Zimbabweans can be excellent.\n\nThe next step is obviously very daunting, but we are excited by the challenge of what is to come, he added.\n\nZimbabwe Sables are expected to arrive in the country on Tuesday evening at Robert Mugabe International Airport in Harare.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Rugby Union supporter union is set to give the team a heros welcome.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nMalcolm-Jamal Warner, an actor best known for his role as Theo Huxtable on The Cosby Show, has died.\n\nWarner, who was 54, drowned at the weekend while on holiday in Costa Rica, local authorities said.\n\nWarner appears to have been dragged out to sea by a swift ocean current while swimming at Playa Grande around 14:00 (20:00 GMT) local time on Sunday in Cocles, a town in the province of Limn, Costa Ricas Judicial Investigation Agency said.\n\nWarner played the son of Bill Cosby on the hugely popular US sitcom from 1984-1992. Tributes swiftly poured in from celebrities, including Questlove, Jennifer Hudson, Taraji P Henson, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Magic Johnson.\n\nAuthorities said bystanders rescued Warner and brought him to shore, where the Costa Rican Red Cross tried to treat him, but he was declared dead at the scene.\n\nHe is survived by his wife and daughter.\n\nWarner was Emmy-nominated in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a comedy series for his work on The Cosby Show in 1986.\n\nHe was handpicked for his breakout role by Cosby on the final day of a nationwide audition.\n\nI was literally the last person they saw, he recalled in a 2023 interview.\n\nThe Cosby Show ranked as the number one TV show for five seasons from 1985-90. It portrayed a cosy middle-class family  a relatively rare depiction at the time of black Americans on television.\n\nWhen the show first came out, there were white people and black people talking about [how] the Huxtables dont really exist, black people dont really live like that, Warner said in a 2013 interview.\n\nMeanwhile, we were getting tens of thousands of fan letters from people saying, Thank you so much for this show.'\n\nAfter The Cosby Show, Warner appeared in several other television programmes including Malcom & Eddie, alongside comedian Eddie Griffin.\n\nGriffin paid respects to him on social media after his death, writing R.I.P. King and My big little brother.\n\nWarner had guest appearances on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Sesame Street. More recently, he played AJ Austin, a cardio-thoracic surgeon on the medical drama series The Resident.\n\nWarner also won a Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance in 2015, alongside Robert Glasper and Lalah Hathaway for their cover of Stevie Wonders song Jesus Children of America.\n\nHis spoken word album Hiding In Plain View garnered him another Grammy nomination in 2023.\n\nLast year, he started a podcast  Not All Hood  which discussed mental health in the black community.\n\nFormer co-stars and fans has been posting their tributes to him online.\n\nBasketball star Magic Johnson, who appeared in an AIDS awareness video directed by Warner, wrote that he and his wife were both super fans of the hit Cosby Show and continued to follow his career over the years.\n\nEvery time I ran into Malcolm, we would have deep and fun conversations about basketball, life, and business. He will truly be missed, Johnson wrote.\n\nActress Jennifer Love Hewitt called him a gentleman and an incredible talent.\n\nActress Vivica A Fox posted that she was stunned and saddened by his sudden death, writing: Thanks for ya gifts, king.\n\nTracee Ellis Ross, who starred with Warner on Reed Between the Lines, also mourned him, writing: My heart is so so sad.\n\nWhat an actor and friend you were: warm, gentle, present, kind, thoughtful, deep, funny, elegant. You made the world a brighter place.\n\nSending so much love to your family. Im so sorry for this unimaginable loss.\n\nActress Taraji P Henson posted: Malcolm, we grew up with you. Thank you for the art, the wisdom, the grace you gave us!!!!!\n\nYou left the world better than you found it. Rest easy, king!!!! Your legacy lives far beyond the screen.\n\nActress Niecy Nash posted that she had recently spoken to Warner.\n\nWe talked about how happy we both were in our marriages. Damn friend. You were cornerstone of The Cosby Show.\n\nWe all loved Theo! Never to be forgotten. You will be missed. Rest Easy.\n\nGeorgia Senator Raphael Warnock also praised Warner, writing in a post: For me and so many in my generation, Malcolm-Jamal Warner was a part of our childhood, a brother whose character Theo felt like one of my own.\n\nMay God grant peace to his soul, strength and grace to his grieving family.\n\n",
