            "content": "IOL\n\nThe uMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party has formally delivered a letter of demand to Cyril Ramaphosa, calling on him to resign from office by 9am on Friday, 18 July.\n\nIn the letter seen by IOL, among other things, the MK party tells Ramaphosa that the decision toappoint Professor Cachalia as Acting Minister of Policeis in contravention of the Constitution, because the academic is not a member of Cabinet or the National Assembly.\n\nMK party national spokesperson, Nhlamulo Ndhlela, said Ramaphosa must resign in honour of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela, the founding commander-in-chief of uMkhonto weSizwe  the military wing.\n\nShould Ramaphosa fail to heed this call, the MK party will pursue a range of lawful and peaceful actions, including constitutional litigation, a motion of no confidence in Parliament and rolling mass action nationwide, said Ndlela.\n\nThese steps reflect the will of the people, who, through democratic means, delivered a decisive electoral verdict against the African National Congress under Ramaphosas leadership.\n\nHe said, despite the clear message from the electorate, the will of the people has been undermined by opportunistic political alliances.\n\nDuring the May 2024 general elections,the African National Congress (ANC) secured just 40% of the vote, failing to maintain its decades-long parliamentary majority.\n\nThe so-called Government of National Unity (GNU), formed by the Democratic Alliance, Freedom Front Plus, and their collaborators, has effectively reinstalled the very ANC that South Africans voted out. This betrayal has sparked widespread public outrage and represents a direct affront to democratic accountability, said Ndlela.\n\nThe recent explosive revelations by General Mkhwanazi further expose the GNU as a deeply compromised arrangement, more aligned with criminality than with the constitutional mandate to serve the people.\n\nHe said the MK party views the GNU as the most dangerous political fraud in post-apartheid South Africa, adding that the political arrangement enables the continued theft of land, resources and dignity.\n\nThe MK party calls on Cyril Ramaphosa and the GNU to respect the voice of the people before irreparable damage is done to South Africas democratic institutions. The time for accountability and ethical leadership is now, said Ndlela.\n\nEarlier,IOL reported that as the streets of Durban became a backdrop for impassioned pleas for justice, Soweto residents and supporters of Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi also took to the streets in support of the KZN police commissioner on Tuesday.\n\nMarching from Thokoza Park to the Kliptown police station, the small group lamented the recent deaths of councillors and other activists whose murders have not been resolved, while crime continues to spiral out of control.\n\nIn Durban, supporters of Mkhwanazi marched from Curries Fountain to Hoy Park to deliver a memorandum, calling for the police commissioners protection.\n\nThis march followed his recent media briefing, which has lifted the lid on alleged deep-rooted corruption within the SAPS.\n\n",

In a stark revelation, KwaZulu-Natal Provincial Police Commissioner, Lieutenant General Nhlanhla Mkhwanazi, claimed a powerful criminal syndicate has infiltrated South Africas law enforcement and judicial systems.\n\nMkhwanazi went one step further, accusing Mchunu of meddling in sensitive cases and colluding with a businessman accused of murder, aiming to dismantle the task force investigating a spate of political killings in KwaZulu-Natal.\n\nIn light of these explosive allegations, President Ramaphosa has taken decisive action, placing Mchunu on special leave while also initiating a judicial commission of inquiry to be led by Acting Deputy Chief Justice Mbuyiseli Madlanga.\n\nThe commission is tasked with investigating claims of interference in investigations, complicity among government officials, and the suppression of crucial law enforcement activities.\n\nMchunu, embroiled in controversy over the past week, has been accused by Mkhwanazi of being entwined with drug cartels and influential business concerns.\n\nAmong the allegations presented was an assertion that Lieutenant-General Shadrack Sibiya, deputy national commissioner for crime detection, colluded with Mchunu and a known information dealer, Brown Mogotsi, in a plot to disband the KwaZulu-Natal political killings task team.\n\nPolice Commissioner Masemola announced that Sibiya would also be requesting a leave of absence while investigations unfold, indicating a stern approach to restoring integrity within the police service.\n\n",

Stability measures crime levels, civil unrest, and the threat of conflict.\n\nHealthcare assesses the quality and availability of public and private services. Culture and environment consider factors like climate, recreational options, and personal freedoms.\n\nEducation is judged by access to quality public and private schooling, while infrastructure focuses on roads, transport, housing, and global connectivity. These combined metrics provide a snapshot of how liveable a city is for its residents.\n\nMost African nations are grappling with persistent economic pressures, insecurity, and strained public services.\n\nIn many of these cities, ongoing political unrest, insecurity, limited access to quality healthcare, and under-resourced education systems contribute topoor livability scores.\n\nIn Nigeria, cities like Lagos and Port Harcourt continue to suffer from overcrowding, inadequate healthcare systems, and rising crime rates, while Zimbabwes capital, Harare, remains burdened by hyperinflation, aging infrastructure, and limited access to essential services.\n\nAlgeria and Libya have also been named among the worldsmost difficult placesto live, joining Nigeria and Zimbabwe in a ranking that highlights the pressures facing several African cities.\n\nFor example, Tripoli in Libya continues to struggle with the effects of prolonged conflict and weakened institutions, while Algiers faces structural economic challenges and restrictions on civil liberties.\n\nThese issues are compounded byinadequate infrastructureand housing conditions that fall short of global standards.\n\nThe table below presents the ten most challenging cities to live in globally.\n\nCities at the bottom of the liveability rankings are predominantly located in the Middle East and Africa, reflecting persistent instability, limited infrastructure, and constrained access to quality services.\n\n",
