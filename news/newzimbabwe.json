At the African Conference on the Rule of Law in 1961, the late national hero said that;\n\nThe legal profession consists of judges, practitioners and teachers of the law. It is to these persons that the protection and defense of the Rule of Law is entrusted. All must be as far as possible from both executive and social pressures,CLZG said.\n\nThe frustrated barristers collectively condemned the politicisation of judges training and called on all arms of the government to respect the principle of separation of powers and the rule of law, which are embedded in the supreme law of the country.\n\nThey maintained that subjecting Judges to the indoctrination exercise directly contravenes Section 164 of the Constitution, which bars any vested interests from interfering with the judiciary.\n\nSubjecting Judges who must at all times be independent and seen to be independent to an ideology of one party to the exclusion of others not only compromises the judiciary but attacks its independence and impartiality.\n\nWe note that this is all happening at a time when the public confidence in the judiciary is low, given the widely held public perception that the judiciary is captured by the Executive, added CLZG|.\n\nMeanwhile, authorities wereforced to fold their tails and cancel the training program after incessantcriticism of the exercise.\n\n",

They told the court they were coerced into drug-fuelled freak offs  which were also referred to as hotel nights or wild king nights  with male escorts, and abused throughout their relationships.\n\nCombss defence team painted a very different picture in their attempts to show that all sexual acts, including freak offs, were consensual.\n\nThey conceded the music star could be violent, had a bad temper, and used drugs. He also had multiple relationships at the same time. But crucially, they said, while he was not proud of some of his behaviour, none of it made him guilty of the charges against him.\n\nAfter hearing evidence of flights and travel for escorts and Cassie and Jane, paid for by Combs, as well as hotel bookings across the US and the Caribbean, jurors have found him guilty of the transportation to engage in prostitution charge. However, they agreed with the defence that the allegations against the rapper did not amount to sex-trafficking or racketeering.\n\nThe Cassie hotel tape\n\nCombs, known variously as Puff Daddy, P Diddy, and Diddy over the years, was once one of the most influential figures in hip-hop  famous as a producer, founder of Bad Boy Records and manager of the late Notorious BIG in the 1990s, as well as a rapper in his own right.\n\nAs an artist, he won three Grammys during his career, and had hits including Ill Be Missing You, Come With Me, and Bad Boy For Life.\n\nIn September 2023, he received the global icon award from MTV and was given the key to New York City at a ceremony in Times Square, just a few miles away from the streets in Harlem where he spent his first years.\n\nAllegations first came to prominence in November 2023, when Cassie, his girlfriend from 2007 to 2018, filed a bombshell lawsuit accusing him of coercing her into unwanted sex sessions, as well as blackmail and several incidences of violence.\n\nThe suit was settled in 24 hours  for $20m, it emerged during the trial  but months later CNNaired hotel security footageshowing Combs punching and kicking Cassie and throwing her to the floor in 2016.\n\nHe apologised after the video aired, saying: I was disgusted when I did it.\n\nFootage from the hotel incident was shown during the trial.\n\nFollowing the verdict, the rapper now awaits sentencing. He also still faces several civil lawsuits, most of which were filed in the wake of his arrest in September 2024.\n\n",

They are unable to, or even unwilling to collect what is due to council. A number of people are occupying council-rented houses, they are not paying, Hwende said, adding that even though the rentals were as little as $20 for two-bedroom houses, but still, tenants were still not paying.\n\nHe said there was no willingness on the councils part to recover debt.\n\nWe then discovered that most of the council officials are involved in the issuing of leases, and we suspect that most of them are the ones who are actually holding many of the leases.\n\nOn the sample of houses that we visited in Chinhoyi, we went to about five rented commercial properties and discovered that the shops, the licence, the lease that is issued on a tenant, after the lease is issued, there are about five or six other people there that are renting the next one to the next one before you reach the original owner of the lease. And nothing is coming to the council coffers, added Hwende.\n\nOn the billboard issue from Harare to Chinhoyi, it was the same issue, according to the PAC chairperson who revealed that no rentals were being collected from advertisers.\n\nIn the report on billboards, some councils allegedly destroyed or tampered with technology systems to revert to manual work and loot, as a new system installed was no longer allowing them to loot funds.\n\nIt was reported that in one month, US$1 million was collected in one month from billboard rentals of a certain council as the system was still functional but after being vandalised by the council workers, the following month realised not even a dollar.\n\nEvidence also came out that the issue of collusion between councillors and advertising agencies needs to be further investigated.\n\nWe will be recommending the Auditor General to re-look into these issues. Then also, a lack of commercial enterprises that can augment the dwindling revenues from the local authorities.\n\nIts a major concern in Chinhoyi, theres nothing, no initiative, no plans. In Zvimba, the situation was a little bit different, Hwende highlighted.\n\n",
