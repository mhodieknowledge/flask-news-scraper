            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Supreme Court has dismissed an appeal by a Harare lawyer, Samantha Nhende, challenging a High Court ruling that found she was in a tacit universal partnership with her former partner, Andrew Zigora, effectively upholding the division of their jointly acquired property.\n\nThe ruling reinforces the growing judicial recognition of tacit universal partnerships in Zimbabwe, particularly in relationships governed by customary law but exhibiting economic interdependence and joint contribution akin to civil marriages.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, a tacit universal partnership can arise when a couple cohabitates without a formal marriage, and a court determines they were operating as a partnership based on their conduct.\n\nTo establish this, one must prove: each party contributed something to the partnership (money, labour, or skills), the business was for their joint benefit, and the objective was to make a profit.\n\nIn a recent judgment delivered by Justice Hlekani Mwayera, sitting with Justices Susan Mavangira and George Chiweshe, the court ruled that Nhendes appeal had no merit.\n\nThe court also confirmed the lower courts decision to allocate 55% of the property to Nhende and 45% to Zigora.\n\nThe appeal be and is hereby dismissed with no order as to costs, the Supreme Court ruled.\n\nThe parties entered into an unregistered customary law union on 1 August 2010 and later dissolved it in February 2021.\n\nThroughout the subsistence of the union, both parties were formally employed.\n\nNhende earned US$2,000 monthly as a legal officer, while Zigora was also formally employed by a leading telecommunications company, receiving a gross monthly salary of US$5,000.\n\nPrior to the parties entering into the customary law union, Nhende owned a stand in Manresa Suburb, which was allocated to her by her employer.\n\nZigora also owned a stand in Madokero Suburb.\n\nDuring the union, on 1 November 2015, the parties moved into a flat in Avondale.\n\nThey split financial responsibilities with Zigora responsible for paying rentals of US$550 per month and utilities.\n\nNhende was accountable for food, clothes and maintenance of the house.\n\nWith time, the parties agreed to purchase a property in Mabelreign.\n\nThey mutually secured a mortgage home loan facility through Nhendes bank. The title was thus in Nhendes name.\n\nZigoras stand in Madokero was used as collateral for the mortgage loan.\n\nHe also made deposits into Nhendes bank account, including payments for the home insurance of the property.\n\nZigora also made contributions towards the renovations of the property.\n\nThe parties also incurred and shared medical bills in their efforts to undergo medical procedures to help Nhende conceive.\n\nThe medical issue led to the fallout of the parties, culminating in the dissolution of their customary law union.\n\nZigora approached the court a quo seeking an order for the distribution of the matrimonial property of the parties.\n\nHe argued that the parties unregistered customary law union was a tacit universal partnership in which both parties contributed individually and collectively to the acquisition of the property.\n\nAfter obtaining the mortgage bond, Nhendes salary was centred on the repayments of the loan, whereas he catered for all other expenses, including the renovations of the property, as it had been purchased to be a matrimonial home.\n\nThe parties intended to raise a family on that property.\n\nNhende in the High Court averred that there was no tacit universal partnership between herself and the respondent, because they each managed their finances individually, even though they were staying as husband and wife.\n\nShe argued that the concept of tacit universal partnership does not apply to customary law unions.\n\nThe property in question, located at 2 Glynde Avenue, Mabelreign, was purchased during the parties unregistered customary law union, which lasted from August 2010 to February 2021.\n\nThough the property was registered in Nhendes name and the mortgage was drawn from her salary, the court found that Zigora contributed significantly to the household, renovations, and insurance, and had even offered his own property in Madokero as collateral for the mortgage loan.\n\nThe High Court had ruled that the property was jointly owned through a tacit universal partnershipa finding Nhende contested on appeal.\n\nNhendes legal counsel, Mr. T. Mapuranga, argued that the High Court erred in law by finding a tacit universal partnership without direct evidence of pooled finances or shared ownership intentions. He further contended that the court failed to consider Zigoras Madokero stand as part of the parties combined estate and that improvements made by Zigora should have been addressed under unjust enrichment rather than as contributions justifying ownership.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court disagreed.\n\nJustice Mwayera wrote: Their conduct during the acquisition and development of the property meets the requirements of a tacit universal partnership The parties consistently consulted each other on every intricate detail relating to the acquisition and renovation of the property.\n\nMwayera noted that the doctrine of tacit universal partnership applies where individuals in a close personal relationship contribute jointlyfinancially or otherwisefor their shared benefit, even outside a formal legal marriage.\n\nOn the issue of law application, the court reinforced that when customary law is inadequate to resolve a property dispute equitably, general law principles, such as tacit universal partnership and unjust enrichment, may justifiably be invoked.\n\nAddressing the division of the property, the court held that the High Court exercised its discretion judiciously by acknowledging both parties contributions.\n\nRegarding the Madokero property, the Supreme Court concurred with the respondents argument that it was irrelevant to the current dispute as it was not part of the pleadings before the High Court and had been acquired before the union.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nA white South African farm worker accused of killing two black women says he was forced to feed their bodies to pigs, according to lawyers.\n\nAdrian de Wet is one of three men facing murder charges after Maria Makgato, 45, and Lucia Ndlovu, 34, were killed while allegedly looking for food on a farm near Polokwane in South Africas northern Limpopo province last year.\n\nTheir bodies were then alleged to have been given to pigs in an apparent attempt to dispose of the evidence.\n\nMr De Wet, 20, turned state witness when the trial started on Monday and says farm owner Zachariah Johannes Olivier shot and killed the two women.\n\nMs Makgato and Ms Ndlovu were searching for soon-to-expire dairy products which had been left for pigs when they were killed.\n\nMr De Wet, a supervisor on the farm, will testify that he was under duress when he was forced to throw their bodies into the pig enclosure, according to both the prosecution and his lawyer.\n\nIf the court accepts his testimony, all charges against him will be dropped.\n\nThe case has sparked outrage across South Africa, exacerbating racial tensions in the country.\n\nSuch tension is especially rife in rural areas, despite the end of the racist system of apartheid more than 30 years ago. Most private farmland remains in the hands of the white minority, while most farm workers are black and poorly paid, fuelling resentment among the black population, while many white farmers complain of high crime rates.\n\nWilliam Musora, 50, another farm worker, is the third accused. He and Mr Olivier, 60, are yet to enter a plea and remain behind bars.\n\nThe three men also face charges of attempted murder for shooting at Ms Ndlovus husband, who was with the women at the farm  as well as possession of an unlicensed firearm and obstructing justice for allegedly dumping the bodies in the pig enclosure in an attempt to conceal evidence.\n\nMr Musora, a Zimbabwean national, faces an additional charge under South Africas Immigration Act over his status as an illegal immigrant.\n\nThe Limpopo High Court was packed with supporters and relatives of the victims ahead of proceedings. Also present was Mr Oliviers wife, who was seated in the front row of the public gallery and could be seen wiping away tears.\n\nMembers of opposition party Economic Freedom Fighters, which has previously called for the farm to be shut down, were also present in the courtroom.\n\nThe trial was postponed to next week.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa has conceded that South Africa is grappling with the United States decision to impose a30% tariff on local imports, but insists the country is not alone in facing mounting global trade challenges.\n\nIn his weekly newsletter, Ramaphosa described the new US tariffs as a stark reminder of the urgent need to adapt to increasingly turbulent headwinds in international trade.\n\nThe US is South Africas second-largest trading partner by country, and these measures will have a considerable impact on industries that rely heavily on exports to that country and on the workers they employ, as well as on our fiscus, he said.\n\nSectors such as agriculture, automotive and textiles have historically benefited from duty-free access to the US market under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which now faces disruption.\n\nRamaphosa said that South Africas trade relationship with the US has historically been complementary, saying local exports do not compete with US producers and do not pose a threat to US industry.\n\nLargely, our exports are inputs into US industries and therefore support the United States industrial base, he said.\n\nSouth Africa is also the biggest investor from the African continent into the US, with 22 of our companies investing in a number of sectors including mining, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and the food chain.\n\nThe 30% tariff was recently announced by the Trump administration and will take effect on 7 August.\n\nSouth Africa is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa singled out for the steep tariff, reflecting deteriorating relations between Pretoria and Washington.\n\nOther African countries, such as Lesotho and Zimbabwe, will face a 15% tariff from the same date.\n\nThe announcement is a significant blow to South Africas economy, particularly as the government had been working to strengthen trade ties with the US.\n\nThis included deals on liquefied natural gas imports, easing poultry import regulations and investments in US industries.\n\nRamaphosa defended South African imports, arguing they ultimately benefit US consumers through greater variety and lower costs.\n\nFor example, citrus production is counter-seasonal and does not pose a threat to US production, he said.\n\nFurthermore, production by US companies has been on the decline due to low yields, citrus greening disease and other factors unrelated to competition from imports.\n\nSouth Africa, the worlds second-largest citrus exporter, has helped to stabilise supply and prices in the US market.\n\nWe have been engaging the United States to enhance mutually beneficial trade and investment relations. All channels of communication remain open, said Ramaphosa.\n\nOur foremost priority is protecting our export industries.\n\nHe said the government would continue to engage with US officials while also accelerating efforts to diversify export markets, particularly within Africa.\n\nWith a view to helping our producers and exporters aggressively explore alternative markets, we have established an Export Support Desk to assist affected producers, he said.\n\nRamaphosa added that details of a support package for companies, producers and workers impacted by the tariffs would be announced soon.\n\nHe said the intervention would also assist industries seeking to expand into regions such as the rest of Africa, Asia, the Middle East and other existing trade agreement markets.\n\nStrengthening regional value chains will be key to building resilience for our export markets in the longer term, he said.\n\nMuch as strengthening and establishing alternative value chains will take time, this moment presents us with an opportunity to push forward with the implementation and expansion of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nRamaphosa stressed the need to reduce South Africas dependence on specific export markets, calling it a strategic imperative to build economic resilience.\n\nIn the coming months, we will be scaling up our trade missions into new markets in Africa and beyond, as well as the National Exporter Development Programme, whose aim is to grow the pool of export-ready companies, he said.\n\nTrump has opposed several South African policies, including land expropriation, which he controversially claimed allowed land to be taken from white farmers.\n\nThe Presidency has firmly denied such claims,including that one of genocide on white farmers.\n\nRamaphosa met with Trump in May in a bid to mend relations, but no progress was made as things had gone worse.\n\nDespite growing tensions, Ramaphosa insisted that South Africa is not alone in facinghigh tariffs.\n\nA number of export-reliant developed and developing economies, including several on the continent, are also grappling with these measures, he said.\n\nThe international trading system is changing. Complacency will not serve us, and building resilience is imperative.\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of Departments of Trade, Industry and Competition Parks Tau and Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Ronald Lamola will be having a joint press briefing on Monday morning to address the issue of high tariffs.\n\nThe briefing will take place at 10 a.m. at the Germiston Civic Centre, in Ekurhuleni.\n\nMeanwhile on Saturday,ANC NEC member Dr Kgosientsho Ramokgopatold journalists there had been a spirited and robust discussion on the US tariffs.\n\nHe said negotiations between the US and South Africa were ongoing, and expressed confidence that the two nations would be able to find each other.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZANU PF Legal Secretary Patrick Chinamasa has said controversial businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei is now a member of the partys Central Committee and the matter is over and irreversible.\n\nTagwireis co-option into the Central Committee has dragged on, with a faction within the ruling party reportedly opposed to his endorsement into the influential organ.\n\nIn a statement posted on socialmedia, Chinamasa said, The Zanupf Department of Legal Affairs is relieved and takes note that the furore/controversy/confusion/wrangle/much ado about nothing/social media hype/misinformation/disinformation that surrounded Harare Provincial Coordinating Committee (PCC) co-option of Cde Kudakwashe Tagwirei into the Zanu PF Central Committee is now over and irreversibly settled.\n\nFrom the outset, it was difficult to understand the source of the problem. Our Harare PCC convened on Monday, 31 March 2025, and voted to recommend the cooption of Cde Tagwirei into the Central Committee.\n\nThe Province addressed the letter of recommendation to the Zanupf Secretary General, Cde Dr. Obert Moses Mpofu. The letter was copied to the Departments of the Commissariat and Legal Affairs, amongst others.\n\nThe confirmation by Chinamsa is in contradiction with the ZANU PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwasremarks earlier this month that Tagwireis bribe would not work in the party.\n\nTagwireis admission into this elite structure is being widely interpreted as part of a long-term strategy to position him for a future presidential bid, setting him on a collision course with other factions, particularly those aligned with Vice President Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nThe ZANU PF benefactor has been viewed as exploiting his proximity to President Emmerson Mnangagwa to push his leadership agenda.\n\nChinamasa acknowledged that the co-option of Tagwirei has been divisive in the ruling party.\n\nSo the controversy surrounding Cde Tagwireis co-option into the Central Committee surprises me and took me completely off guard. Given Cde Tagwireis commitment to Zanupf and his track record in the service of the Party, the somewhat negative publicity and narrative surrounding his co-option into the Central Committee is undeserved.\n\nI have been a member of the Zanupf Central Committee continuously and without break since December 1987, and a member of the Zanupf Politburo since the year 2000 to date, and I can state unequivocally that throughout this long period of nearly 38 years as Central Committee or as Politburo, we have never had to debate, let alone discuss, PCC recommendations of cooptions into the Central Committee. We always treated such recommendations as fait accompli.\n\nThe cooption of Cde Tagwirei is the first ever to be the subject of discussion and social media commentaries. The only explanation why the Tagwirei cooption has attracted such controversy may be because there are people out there who, for reasons best known to themselves, have an axe to grind, said Chinamasa.\n\n",
