            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said it would like to see the ZiG fully becoming a national currency, as it weighs whether to place Zimbabwe on a staff-monitored program.\n\nThe ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, succeeded the Zimbabwean dollar in April 2024 after multiple crashes. Its the countrys sixth attempt since 2009 to replace the dollar as the southern African nations main transacting currency, but is yet to succeed.\n\nSeveral measures will need to be adopted to boost ZiG usage, including deepening the foreign-exchange market to ensure full price discovery, said Wojciech Maliszewski, the Washington-based lenders mission chief, who is in Zimbabwe to review its request for a new SMP. The nations last program ended abruptly in 2019 after the central bank printed money that fueled the collapse of the local currency.\n\nRight now we see good stability in the official market and we also see a convergence between the parallel and official rate, he told reporters Monday after meeting Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa in the capital, Harare. Ideally, we would like to see an elimination of this gap, we would like to see one exchange rate.\n\nStill, the ZiGs 43% devaluation in September to narrow the gap between the official and unofficial rate and its inconvertibility has led citizens to favor dollars.\n\nThe ZiG traded little changed on Tuesday at 26.96 against the dollar and exchanged hands at 32 to 35 on the parallel market.\n\nThe Washington-based lender said it isnt pushing for more exchange rate depreciation but for the two rates to converge supported by government fiscal discipline.\n\nThere is a good chance that these rates will converge, Maliszewski said.\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncube last month at the annual meetings of the African Development Bank said he expected the SMP to be finalized by the end of June. The program would bring Zimbabwe closer toward revamping its $21 billion debt pile with creditors that want assurances that its authorities are pursuing prudent fiscal and monetary policies.\n\n",
