Greediness knows no boundaries, and this will lead to a huge disaster for the country.\n\nEarlier this week,IOL reported that Zanu PF has emboldened its move to push through a proposal allowing Mnangagwa to remain in powerbeyond his current constitutional term, which ends in 2028. The party recently adopted a resolution at its annual conference backing the extension to align with the governments so-called Vision 2030 development agenda.\n\nKasukuwere, once a senior figure in the Zanu PF government led by Robert Mugabe before going into exile during the 2017 military intervention, became one of the most prominent former insiders to condemn the partys Mnangagwa plan publicly.\n\nZanu-PF party has announced plans to begin the process of extendingMnangagwas term of officeby two years  a move that, if successful, would keep him in power until 2030.\n\nThe proposal was formally endorsed at the partys annual national peoples conference in the eastern city of Mutare over the weekend. Delegates instructed government structures to start work on legislation to amend the constitution.\n\nAccording to State-ownedThe Herald, delegates argued that the extension would allow Mnangagwa to complete ongoing national development programmes aligned with the governments Vision 2030 agenda.\n\nThe conference adopted the resolution unanimously, describing it as a step toward ensuring policy continuity and consolidating the gains made under Mnangagwas leadership.\n\nZanu-PFs acting political commissar, Munyaradzi Machacha, toldThe Heraldthat the resolution formed part of the official conference outcomes and would be referred to the partys central committee for consideration.\n\nOur president has demonstrated exceptional leadership in driving national development. The conference agreed he should be supported to continue implementing Vision 2030, Machacha said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) has condemned plans by the ruling Zanu PF party to amend the Constitution and extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas tenure, describing the proposal as a betrayal of democracy and a setback for the nation.\n\nMnangagwas loyalists are pushing to delay the 2028 general elections and extend his rule to 2030, a move that has sparked growing criticism from opposition parties, civil society, and now the countrys largest labour federation.\n\nIn a statement, ZCTU Secretary General Tirivanhu Marimo said the proposed constitutional amendment violates fundamental principles of democracy, constitutionalism and respect for the rule of law.\n\nIt is not in the interest of ordinary workers or citizens for the Constitution, the supreme law of the land, to be mutilated to serve selfish individual ambitions. Such actions risk plunging the nation into political instability and chaos, eroding confidence in governance systems and undermining production, investment, economic growth and job creation, Marimo said.\n\nHe added that Zimbabwe has many capable leaders who could take over the presidency when Mnangagwas second and final term ends in 2028.\n\nNo one is irreplaceable or immortal, and we should avoid creating idols and demigods in the country. The presidency is sacrosanct and must not be adulterated through unholy constitutional departures fronted by cheerleaders and political vultures void of the interests of the grassroots, the ZCTU Secretary General said.\n\nMarimo warned that Zimbabwe must not follow the path of African nations such as Uganda, Rwanda, Ivory Coast, Burundi, Chad, and the Republic of Congo, where leaders have altered constitutions to prolong their rule.\n\nThe labour body said it would soon begin nationwide consultations with workers and citizens to determine the next course of action and vowed to resist the proposed constitutional changes through possible mass action.\n\nWe are not short of solutions to defend the democratic turf and we are prepared to flood the streets if ZANU-PF remains stubborn on the dishonourable 2030 agenda.\n\nAs a matter of principle, the ZCTU will always stand on the side of democracy, constitutionalism, and the people of Zimbabwe. We reaffirm that the Constitution must remain the unshakeable framework guiding our nations governance, not a tool of political convenience, added Marimo.\n\n",
