            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nSTRIKING lecturers have revised their demands, issuing an ultimatum to the University of Zimbabwe (UZ)to provide incentives to end their 70-day industrial action.\n\nThe lecturers have been on strike for three months, demanding an increase in their salaries. They are seeking wages of US$2,250, up from their current US$230.\n\nThe lecturers have refused to oversee ongoing examinations, instead picketing outside the university.\n\nThe Association of University Teachers (AUT) Obvious Vengeyi spokesperson stated that the revised demands give the government room to explore other avenues of addressing their grievances while negotiations for the US$2,250 continue.\n\nWe have put across our demand for salaries. We are demanding regional parity, which is the pre-October 2018 salary. We have added non-monetary incentives in case the government cannot provide the US$2,250 immediately.\n\nThis means we have also put in place a roadmap whereby, after every four months, we should be able to discuss a review so that within one year, we should reach regional parity. We have included non-monetary incentives, residential stands, commercial stands, and agricultural land. We have also added a demand for free education.\n\nLecturers here at the University of Zimbabwe were previously required to pay fees if they wished to further their education. We demand that all University of Zimbabwe employees be exempt from paying fees, said Vengeyi.\n\nWATCH | UZ lecturers strike continues, now on day 69\n\n\"Part-final students who are doing dissertations are now being told to bring whatever they have so they can be given marks,\" says AUT spokesperson Obvious Vengei.pic.twitter.com/KLg8rDO934\n\n NewZimbabwe.com (@NewZimbabweCom)June 23, 2025\n\nThe UZ has responded to the strike by suspending the lecturers and replacing them with temporary teachers to oversee examinations.\n\nThe government recently offered a 20 percent increase, a move rejected by the AUT.\n\nThe UZ has not made any response. They have not made any offer, which is why todays picketing emphasised the need for, and demand of, an offer from UZ.\n\nThe Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education has made an offer of 20% across the board and 35% to the Vice-Chancellor, the very people responsible for this mess have been rewarded, which is quite unfair.\n\nSo, we have put forward our counter-demand in response to the ministrys offer. First and foremost, we reject this 20% as meaningless because if you give someone 20% of US$230, that is essentially nothing, said Vengeyi.\n\n",

That spider web is our movement, it is complex, beautiful and strong, but it only works if we remain together and united.\n\nCoventry said she could not believe how her life had evolved since she first dreamt of Olympic glory in 1992.\n\nHow lucky are we creating a platform for generations to come to reach their dreams, she said to a packed audience in a marquee in the Olympic House garden, which comprised IOC members, including those she defeated, and dignitaries.\n\nIt is amazing and incredible, indeed I cannot believe that from my dream in 1992 of going to the Olympic Games and winning a medal, I would be standing here with you to make dreams for more young children round the world.\n\nCoventry, who served in the Zimbabwean government as sports and arts minister from 2019 to this year, said the Olympic movement was much more than a multi-sport event platform.\n\nWe (IOC members) are guardians of this movement, which is also about inspiring and changing lives and bringing hope, she said.\n\nThese things are not to be taken lightly, and I will be working with each and every one of you to continue to change lives and be a beacon of hope in a divided world.\n\nI am really honoured to walk this journey with you.\n\nBach, who during his tenure had to grapple withRussian dopingand their invasions of the Crimea andUkraineas well as theCovid pandemic, said he was standing down filled with gratitude, joy and confidence in his successor.\n\nWith her election, it sends out a powerful message that the IOC continues to evolve, said the 71-year-old German, who was named honorary lifetime president in Greece in March.\n\nIt has its first female and African to hold this position, and the youngest president since Pierre de Coubertin. She represents the truly global and youthful spirit of our community.\n\nBach, who choked back tears at one point during his valedictory speech, was praised to the rafters by Coventry, who was widely seen as his preferred candidate of the seven vying for his post.\n\nAfter a warm embrace, she credited him with teaching her to listen to people and to respect them, and praised him for leading the movement with pure passion and purpose.\n\nYou have kept us united through the most turbulent times.\n\nYou left us with many legacies and hope, thank you from the bottom of my heart for leading us with passion and never wavering from our values.\n\n",

Malaria-related deaths also surged from 51 in 2024 to 317 in 2025. The increase in deaths is largely due to delays in accessing treatment, as many cases occurred in remote locations far from health facilities.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Health, the majority of these were concentrated in just three provinces.\n\nHarare reported 685 cases and Bulawayo reported 67 cases, mainly due to complicated or referred cases.\n\nMalaria also continues to disproportionately affect rural communities in Mashonaland Central, Manicaland, and Mashonaland West.\n\nMeanwhile, government has urged all citizens, especially those in high-risk zones as well as artisanal miners, to take preventive measures such as wearing clothing that covers most of your body when outdoors between sunset and sunrise, use mosquito repellents, sleep in sprayed rooms in districts that receive Indoor Residual Spraying and sleep under an Insecticide Treated Net (ITN) every day. Seek treatment within 24 hours from the Village Health Worker or from the nearest health facility, to prevent progression to severe disease that can lead to death.\n\n",

This vision will continue to gain momentum in 2025. Our approach involves divesting of non-core assets and concentrating resources on high-performing properties in prime locations, he said.\n\nBy streamlining operations and enhancing service standards, Laurie said the company aims to deliver consistent experiences that align with evolving guest expectations prompted by the strategy to allow for greater investment in innovative technologies and sustainability initiatives.\n\nIn keeping with this thrust, the Group has sold the Great Zimbabwe Hotel and earmarked Monomotapa Hotel and Caribbea Bay Resort for sale. These disposals will allow for the prioritisation of the refurbishment of the remaining properties within the portfolio, as well as allocating funds for the development of phase 2 of the Marlborough Sunset Views residential stands, said Ward.\n\nThe Hotels top three performers for the 2024 financial year were Elephant Hills Resort and Conference Centre, Holiday Inn Harare and Holiday Inn Bulawayo. These contributed 54% to the Groups total revenue for the year.\n\nThe hospitality portfolio achieved a combined annual occupancy of 59% for the period under review, a 7% improvement from the 55% achieved in 2023. This equated to almost 15,854 additional room nights sold during 2024.\n\nThe three branded InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) hotels, namely, Holiday Inn Harare, Holiday Inn Bulawayo, and Holiday Inn Mutare, continue to meet all the requirements of the IHG brand standards, having all passed compliance audits in 2024. Additionally, the lease of both the Holiday Inn Harare and Holiday Inn Bulawayo properties were extended for a further 20-year period, added Ward.\n\n",

            "content": "By Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ\n\nThis story was originally published byGlobal Press Journal.\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  A few days after giving birth to her youngest daughter in May 2024, Shirley Celebrate Mkono, a 34-year-old mother of four, went to her local clinic to seek help for persistent headaches. Nursing staff worried she could have uncontrolled hypertension, recalls Mkono as she cradles her daughter, now 1 year old.\n\nThe attending nurse informed me that my blood pressure was extremely high and I could collapse at any point, she says.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Mkono agreed to call a private ambulance for US$30. Even so, she waited four distressing hours for help to come.\n\nIf the clinic had an ambulance in sight, it could not have taken this long, she says. I could have died.\n\nOnly four public ambulances serve Harares over 2.4 million people, far short of the 32 ambulances the city says it needs; it would take a fleet of 48 to bring Harare in line with international guidelines of one ambulance for every 50,000 people.\n\nIn February, the city council introduced a monthly emergency services levy of US$1 per household to fund additional ambulances for council clinics, collected as part of the monthly electric bill. However, the councils poor track record in managing public funds has made residents and watchdog groups skeptical that the money raised will be deployed with transparency and accountability.\n\nThe local authority has been grappling with health care financing for a long time, says Reuben Akili, director of Combined Harare Residents Association. Akili says the emergency levy will only be effective if it is collected and spent locally to stop funds from being diverted.\n\nThere must be a mechanism in place that ensures the money is ring-fenced to buy ambulances in places where that money was collected, he says.\n\nMkono, who lives in the suburb of Glen View, is doubtful the levy will serve its purpose.\n\nThere is a lot of corruption at the local authority. We pay for refuse collection about $8 per month, but they dont carry the refuse. I remember I last saw a refuse truck in my area in October last year after the mayor visited our area, she says.\n\nEmbezzlement is a persistent problem in local councils, as highlighted in a 2024 analysis of local authorities conducted by the Southern African Parliamentary Support Trust and a coalition of local nongovernmental organizations. Diversion of funds from critical services like health care and sanitation has contributed to a cycle of mistrust and disillusionment, where citizens are reluctant to pay toward public expenditures that dont actually improve local services.\n\nAkili says the scarcity of public ambulance services has led people who can afford it to use private taxis, which can cost US$10 to US$20.\n\nIn May 2024, President Emmerson Mnangagwa set up an inquiry into the opposition-led Harare City Council following reports of corruption and financial mismanagement. The inquiry revealed that the city council has misspent more than US$1 million, with executives spending over US$125,000 per year on holidays even as the city fails to provide adequate services.\n\nMkono questions why the local authority is adding another levy on residents who already pay user fees when they seek medical care in council clinics.\n\nThey should buy ambulances with that money, she says.\n\nIn a written update to residents on recently introduced levies, which also include a US$1 streetlight levy and US$1 water levy, Precious Shumba, director of Harare Residents Trust, says the new fees were never presented and discussed during the annual budget consultations the city council held across Harare in September 2024. Without an accurate, transparent and functional billing system in place, Shumba writes, the levies add to a long list of revenue streams that have the potential to be abused by the cartels running the affairs of the City of Harare.\n\nCaroline Machivenyika accompanied her 17-year-old pregnant daughter to the local clinic in December last year. When they got there, her daughter was referred to a hospital because she was underage, but Machivenyika learned shed need US$70 to get a private ambulance to take them; the city ambulances were unavailable.\n\nI only had US$50 on me; I explained my situation, and after an hour, a private ambulance arrived, she recalls.\n\nTransfers of expectant mothers and traffic collisions constitute the bulk of emergency incidents that require ambulance services in the city.\n\nLike many other residents, Machivenyika has doubts about whether any funds raised through the levy will genuinely buy ambulances.\n\nWe have lost trust in the local authority because the necessities that we are paying for are not being adequately provided. For instance, we only get water three times a week, but we pay for these services each month, says the mother of four.\n\nCaroline Machivenyika, right, with her mother, Esther Machivenyika, at their home in Glen Norah. Caroline Machivenyika had to wait an hour and pay US$50 for a private ambulance because there wasnt a public one available. Like many residents, she questions whether Harares new monthly emergency levy will lead to real improvements in ambulance service. Photo credit: Gamuchirayi Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nBut she says residents unpaid bills are also an important reason the local authority struggles to provide adequate services.\n\nThey are supposed to close access to water for houses with unpaid bills, but when council workers come, people pay $5 bribes and they leave. Others are not even moved because they do not have access to water daily and do not care even if their water meters are disconnected by the council, she says.\n\nStanley Gama, head of corporate communications for Harare City Council, did not respond to several requests for comment.\n\nOnly one-third of African countries have emergency medical services, and most of them require patients to pay a fee.\n\nUpon reaching the hospital, Mkono was cared for and sent home within 30 minutes. She got a prescription for a months worth of medication to take at home, and her condition quickly resolved.\n\nAmbulances used to arrive promptly when there was a need, recalls Machivenyikas mother, Esther Machivenyika, 75.\n\nI remember in 1995 when my husband got sick at home, we called in an ambulance and it did not take an hour to come through and he was immediately taken to the hospital, she says as she shells peanuts.\n\nIn the 1980s, Zimbabwe had a strong ambulance system with well-trained personnel, including a public service in Harare. But decades of economic instability have left emergency services unable to maintain or procure modern equipment.\n\nNow, Esther Machivenyika says a patient has to pay cash up front to get assistance.\n\nYou can die while negotiating payment, she says.\n\nEven if people pay the emergency levy, she has no hope of a change in the situation because of what she sees as a culture of greed in public service.\n\nThey are now seeing money as more important than a persons health, she says. Even at health facilities, you have to pay a bribe to get good service from nurses.\n\nGamuchirai Masiyiwais a Reporter-in-Residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.

            "content": "Cape Town Etc\n\nThe luxury rail industry across Southern Africa held its breath earlier this year when a Rovos Rail train carrying 47 foreign tourists and 34 staff members collided with a freight train on the Bulawayo-Beitbridge line.\n\nNow, after months of investigation and reflection, the companys Chief Operating Officer Tiffany Vos-Thane has broken her silence about what went wrong that fateful morning,Cape {town} Etcreports.\n\nThis incident marked the first major accident in Rovos Rails 20 years of operation along this route, shaking confidence in Africas luxury rail sector.\n\nThe collision derailed several carriages during the Easter holiday journey to Victoria Falls, tragically claiming the life of one staff member weeks later due to medical complications.\n\nWhile no passengers were physically injured, the psychological impact on both guests and crew has been profound, with the company arranging ongoing trauma counselling for affected employees.\n\nAccording toVos-Thane, while final reports are still being compiled, preliminary findings point squarely to a tragic miscalculation by Bulawayo Beitbridge Railway (BBR) operators.\n\nSomebody made a mistake with the timing, which is just so unfortunate, Vos-Thane revealed in an emotional interview. This is particularly devastating considering we use this line twice weekly without incident. Losing a team member has left us grappling with difficult questions, though we must acknowledge this was an isolated failure in an otherwise reliable system.\n\nMeanwhile, the COO praised the extraordinary emergency response from Zimbabwean authorities, with medical teams and railway officials arriving within minutes. This rapid intervention likely prevented further casualties among the shaken passengers and crew.\n\nSurprisingly, the accident appears to have done little to dampen enthusiasm for Rovos Rails luxury experiences. The company reports receiving just one customer query about line safety since the incident, with demand remaining robust despite global economic uncertainties affecting the travel sector.\n\nA recent Tourism Update poll supports this resilience, with 73% of industry respondents affirming luxury travels enduring appeal. Vos-Thane attributes this to Southern Africas stringent rail safety regulations across all ten countries Rovos operates in, which require annual safety permits for all operators.\n\nAddressing concerns about regional rail infrastructure, the COO acknowledged challenges like loadshedding and cable theft causing delays, particularly on South Africas Pretoria-Cape Town route. However, she noted an 80% improvement in timings recently and expressed optimism about government moves toward rail privatisation.\n\nThe more private investment in our railways, the better the infrastructure becomes, Vos-Thane stated. While billions are needed for full rehabilitation, were seeing promising commitment from authorities.\n\nRather than expanding its fleet of 23 locomotives (including eight electric and four hybrids), Rovos Rail will focus on refurbishing existing carriages and elevating service standards. This quality-over-quantity approach aims to reinforce the brands premium positioning while implementing lessons from Aprils tragedy.\n\nThe company continues working closely with BBR to prevent future timing errors, though Vos-Thane stressed such incidents remain exceptionally rare in African luxury rail travel.\n\nFor now, the iconic trains keep rolling across the continents spectacular landscape, carrying travellers seeking unforgettable journeys through Southern Africas heart.\n\n",
