            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA dramatic power struggle has unfolded within the MDC-T party as Vice President Elias Mudzuri, allegedly in collaboration with Morgen Komichi, launched a bid to oust the partys embattled leader, Douglas Mwonzora, and seize control of Harvest House  the party headquarters in Harare CBD.\n\nThe move comes on the heels of a High Court ruling in late February 2025, in which Justice Hapias Zhou ordered Mwonzora to resign and facilitate a fresh congress within six months.\n\nThe ruling cited irregularities in the 2022 MDC-T Extraordinary Congress that saw Mwonzora elevated to the party leadership.\n\nMudzuri is arguing that, in light of Justice Zhous ruling, he is now the rightful leader of the party, by virtue of his position as Vice President.\n\nMudzuri arrived at Harvest House this morning with a considerable entourage, but was met with fierce resistance from Mwonzoras militant youth supporters, who aggressively blocked his entry.\n\nPolice intervention was ultimately required to prevent the situation from escalating further.\n\nMudzuri was seen leavingin his black Toyota Land Cruiser amidst the commotion.\n\nEarlier, Mudzuri had reportedly ordered Mwonzoras supporters and loyalists to vacate the building, prompting a heated confrontation.\n\nThis resulted in the arrival of truckloads of police officers in riot gear.\n\nMudzuri then briefly disappeared before resurfacing, claiming he had visited Harare Central Police Station to request a police escort to facilitate his occupation of Harvest House.\n\nMwonzora is no longer the President, as per the High Court ruling in February 2025. There is a void in the party presidency that must be filled, claimed one of Mudzuris security personnel, who requested anonymity.\n\nHowever, Albert Chidhakwa, the MDC National Youth Chairman and leader of Mwonzoras militant youth faction at Harvest House, insisted that Mudzuris actions are premature and invalid, as the party has lodged an appeal against Justice Zhous ruling.\n\nThe party has appealed Justice Zhous ruling. Mudzuri cannot rely on the High Court ruling because the appeal has rendered it ineffective. President Mwonzora remains the party leader. There is no change to that, he stated.\n\nThe battle for control of Harvest House has been a long-standing source of conflict within the opposition. It intensified following the Supreme Courts decision in March 2020 to nullify Nelson Chamisas ascendancy to the party presidency after the death of founding leader, Morgan Tsvangirai in 2018.\n\nWhile Mwonzora, in his then role as Secretary General, assumed leadership, he has struggled to maintain stability within the party. Many members defected to Chamisa and later to his Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), which was officially formed in 2022.\n\nMwonzoras party chose not to participate in the 2023 elections, citing concerns over irregularities in the delimitation exercise.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nPermanant Secretary in the Ministry of Health and Child Care Dr Aspect Maunganidze says the United States withdrawal of funding for Zimbabwes healthcare sector, coupled with general donor fatigue, has disrupted the countrys HIV financing and programming.\n\nThe Trump administration withdrew funding by at least 85% worldwide earlier this year, severely affecting several poor countries, including Zimbabwe.\n\nGiving oral evidence to the Joint Portfolio Committee on Health and Child Care and the Thematic Committee on HIV and AIDS on HIV financing this Tuesday, Maunganidze said the reduced financing due to donor withdrawal had forced the ministry to re-strategise its funding mechanisms.\n\nHe told the committees that the ministry had written to Treasury seeking a supplementary budget to close the funding gap created by the US withdrawal and donor fatigue, in order to strengthen the national HIV response.\n\nThe main challenges in HIV and AIDS funding have always included some funding gaps, regardless of donor support or otherwise. Even ensuring that our strategic plan is truly a national HIV strategic plan that is sustainable, particularly in HIV prevention and related initiatives, has been difficult.\n\nHowever, the major threat right now is the withdrawal of donor funding.\n\nWhat we have observed globally is a general fatigue in donor funding. Whether it comes through the UN, the Global Fund, or other partners, this fatigue is concerning. There are now many competing global health and humanitarian challenges that have emerged in recent years, not just HIV and AIDS.\n\nThis has unfortunately been compounded by the abrupt withdrawal of funding from one of our key donorsthe US government, Maunganidze said.\n\nHe explained that the US had been supporting HIV funding through PEPFAR (Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) and by contributing significantly to the Global Fund.\n\nThe US government contributes 30% of the Global Fund, which supports HIV, TB, and malaria interventions.\n\nThrough PEPFAR and US implementing agencies like the CDC and the Presidents Malaria Initiative, this sudden funding withdrawal has had significant consequences for our healthcare services, he said.\n\nMaunganidze also outlined Zimbabwes domestic and international HIV financing models.\n\nDomestically, we rely on the national budget allocation and the Health Levy (a 5% tax on mobile data and airtime), which supports various programs, including HIV.\n\nWeve also introduced specific taxes through the main budgetlike the recently implemented Health Sugar Levyto help strengthen our HIV response, he said.\n\nOn the international front, Maunganidzecited continued support from the Global Fund, the Health Development Fund, and donors such as the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.\n\nHe added that the ministry also works with the United Nations and follows UNAIDS Fast-Track commitments for 2020 and 2026, which aim to strengthen HIV responses in the country.\n\nIn general, partners contribute between 50% and 65% of funding for our HIV response.\n\nWhen looking at the overall health budget, development partners have contributed between 35% and 45%, and in some years, even beyond 50%, he noted.\n\nFollowing the US funding withdrawal announced on January 20, 2025, the government responded by announcing on May 15, 2025, intensified efforts to mobilise more domestic resources and laid out a roadmap to strategically boost local HIV drug production.\n\nI must say we are okay on HIV funding until at least January 20, 2026. The same applies to TB and malaria medicines.\n\nHowever, we must continue ensuring that our local revenue streams support a sustained HIV response so that we maintain our gains, particularly on the 95-95-95 UN targets, which we have already achieved.\n\nSince January, over 5,000 HIV-related deaths have been recorded, raising serious concerns about the governments need to increase investment in HIV financing and programming.\n\n",
