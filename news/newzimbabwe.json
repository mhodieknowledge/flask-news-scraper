            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nMovement for Democratic Change (MDC) is in a tense fight for its premises after an activist from the party seized the Morgan Richard Tsvangirai building, popularly known as Harvest House.\n\nThe building, known as Harvest House, was seized by Shakespeare Mukoyi, who serves as the Secretary for Defence, on Wednesday. He claimed to have evicted Douglas Mwonzora, whom he accused of running down the party.\n\nSpeaking after the takeover of the party headquarters, Mukoyi said the once formidable opposition party had fallen under Mwonzoras leadership.\n\nIn the history of the MDC, even in the hostile areas, never had a day it got a zero on a polling station, let alone in a ward. So it gives us a worry as members of the security. Currently, I am holding the position of secretary for defence. It is my obligation and powers invested in my office to make sure that I defend this movement from internal adversaries to external adversaries, said Mukoyi.\n\nThe takeover by Mukoyi is the latest battle for what remains of the MDC, which took a political nosedive after the death of Morgan Tsvangirai in 2018.\n\nSince 2018, the party has been rocked by infighting and splits, weakening a movement that had formidably challenged ZANU PF under Tsvangirai.\n\nThe MDC under Mwonzora took over Harvest House in 2020 from the MDC Alliance, which was then led by Nelson Chamisa, at the height of the partys infighting.\n\nIn a statement, the MDC said the move was an attempt to thwart the partys resistance to ZANU PFs agenda to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas tenure.\n\nIt has come to the attention of the party leadership that one of our comrades gone rogue, Shaky Mukoyi, has locked the partys head office on the guise of purportedly seeking medical assistance.\n\nIt opened up an opportunity for those who have sold their souls to the regime who are advocating for the 2030 agenda within the party, said MDC.\n\nThe MDC added that it would reclaim the building from the youths.\n\nWe will not give in to extortion and rapacity as the MDC assets belong to bona fide members and under the custodianship of the current leadership under the law.\n\nThuggery and banditry are not an MDC culture and will never be since we have been victims of these since the Mugabe regime.\n\nLastly, let me reassure our members, members of the media, the diaspora, and all those who are concerned that within no time, we are taking our property back.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/minnesota-at-90-art-specialist-rex-mhiripiri-is-selling-the-gallery-he-thinks-of-as-a-gift-from-god/",
            "content": "Minnesota Star Tribune\n\nWhen gallery owner Rex Mhiripiri saw a gas station at 90th Street and Penn Avenue S. in Bloomington, he didnt see just gasoline. He saw the future home of his huge two-story Mhiripiri Gallery.\n\nThat was nearly 20 years ago. At 90, hes still working six days a week, answering every phone call, whether its local, spam or from his native Zimbabwe. And hes painting. Always painting.\n\nIts a gift from God, Mhiripiri said of his gallery.\n\nBefore the Bloomington spot, he was in Butler Square, two other downtown Minneapolis locations and then in Edina.\n\nMhiripiri is one of a handful of Twin Cities gallerists in business since the 1980s, and the only local dealer specializing in African art and specifically Shona stone sculpture from Zimbabwe. Last month, he put the building and all the artwork in it up for sale.\n\nThe asking price? $4 million.\n\nThe spacious gallery is filled with Zimbabwe stone sculptures made of springstone, serpentine, opal stone and other stones. They depict families, pregnant women, mothers, daughters, sons and many animals.\n\nAfrican masks and Mhiripiris paintings of elephants, other animals and landscapes cover the walls. Prices range from $15 to $150,000.\n\nInternationally acclaimed Zimbabwe artists Colleen Madamombe, Bernard Matemera and Henry Munyaradzi still show their works with him. A stack of catalogs from Matemeras 1997 show in Paris is still in the gallery.\n\nHe keeps photographs of artwork and artists and trips to Zimbabwe in piles and wooden boxes.\n\nMhiripiri, who still works six days a week, always has seen himself as the familys provider.\n\nI work to protect my wife from want [for anything], he said. We had seven children, and she was a stay-at-home mom. Its my job to make sure that she has everything that she needs.\n\nSome years, the gallery grosses more than $1 million. A client just flew in from Washington, D.C., and bought $250,000 worth of work.\n\nRenowned Twin Cities painter and public artist Ta-coumba T. Aiken, 72, met Mhiripiri in the mid-1980s.\n\nHe had a store and he had a gallery and he was working on his paintings there in the gallery, and actually doing the work  not just showing work, Aiken said. Thats rare.\n\nAiken loved Mhiripiris elephant paintings with scenery. He felt they were just amazing, and not like anything that I saw anywhere else, he said. And by that time, I had seen a lot of art.\n\nAt the time, Aiken was studying Black modernist painter Los Mailou Jones, one of the first African American artists to put African art into her work. Aiken began tracking other African American artists who did the same.\n\nBut Rex didnt care about that sort of thing, he was like, Im just painting, Im doing my work, he said.\n\nAiken bought some of Mhiripiris artworks, and Mhiripiri sold some of Aikens paintings, and they gifted works to each other.\n\nUnlike most gallerists who work on commission, Mhiripiri buys everything outright and sells it.\n\nFormer University of Minnesota professor Roderick Ferguson started collecting from Mhiripiri in 2009.\n\nPeople probably dont know how much of a gem Rex is in terms of the art world and the African art world within the U.S., said Ferguson, 53, chair of the Womens, Gender and Sexuality Studies Department at Yale University.\n\nMhiripiri sold him an 18th-century gun used in the slave trade and manacles used in the Congo during King Leopolds era, to name a few. As a scholar, Ferguson finds these artifacts irresistible.\n\nSteve Wadsworth, 59, founder of 4 Seasons Construction Inc., randomly stopped into Mhiripiri Gallery about 12 years ago. He and Rex became fast friends.\n\nAt the end of Wadsworths driveway, theres a statue from Mhiripiri Gallery of an adult holding four kids.\n\nAnybody who comes to our house knows that family comes first, Wadsworth said. Over the years, hes bought about 30 paintings and sculptures from Mhiripiri.\n\nRex and Julie Mhiripiri have helped build wells in Zimbabwe and put four kids that werent their own through college.\n\nWhen Wadsworth buys art from Mhiripiri, Mhiripiri donates a certain percentage of that to help people in Zimbabwe.\n\nThat makes me feel good, Wadsworth said. I dont have a connection to help people like that.\n\nMhiripiris journey to Minnesota wasnt at all linear. Born in 1935, in Wedza, Rhodesia, (now near Harare, Zimbabwe) Mhiripiri felt stifled by life under the white-run British Commonwealth. There were few career opportunities for Black people.\n\nIn 1958, after being told not to come back to teachers college in Rhodesia, he moved to Tanganyika (now Tanzania), then through Uganda to Kenya. He worked as a salesman for Mobil Oil Co. and later the Kenyan government.\n\nIn 1966 he came to the United States on a State Department scholarship, starting at the University of Rochester in upstate New York before transferring to the University of Minnesota. There he met his wife, Julie, of Albert Lea, who is white.\n\nThey eloped to Kenya in the early 1970s. But with Rhodesia at war, they decided to return to Minnesota.\n\nAfter struggles with alcohol, Mhiripiri got sober at a Christian rehab in Montreal. At 40, he became a committed follower of Jesus.\n\nBut it wasnt until the mid-1980s that he met a missionary who had traveled to Zimbabwe. That man introduced him to Shona stone sculpture  and thats when it clicked. He needed to go back to Zimbabwe and buy art.\n\nIn 1995, thanks to the generosity of a few interested collectors, he and Julie traveled to Zimbabwe for five weeks. He shipped back 81 crates of stone sculpture weighing about 24 tons. They returned every few years, building relationships with artists and importing stone sculpture. His last trip was in 2022.\n\nWhen its slow at the gallery, Mhiripiri paints in his studio on the second floor, often crafting his signature elephant.\n\nOn a quiet Tuesday afternoon in October, he wore loose-fitting jeans, a blue polo shirt and a smock with the 1992 Super Bowl XXVI in Minneapolis printed across it.\n\nHe used a palette knife, smoothing chunks of purple paint onto a canvas. A Christian rock radio station blasted over the speakers.\n\nMhiripiri wonders about the future of the gallery.\n\nIf God gave me this thing  and I believe he did  then God will help me to get rid of it, he said.\n\nWhere:9001 Penn Av. S., Bloomington\n\nWhen:10 a.m.-6 p.m. Mon.-Sat.\n\nCost:Free\n\nInfo:952-285-9684 orshonasculpturemhiripir.com\n\n",
