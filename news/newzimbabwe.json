            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE government has effectively hinted that there will be no salary increments for struggling teachers, who are set to endure another school term amid hardships.\n\nThe third term of 2025 is expected to commence next Tuesday, September 9.\n\nThe countrys educators and the rest of civil servants report taking home US$270 plus local currency, which is way below the realistic cost of living.\n\nDuring a parliamentary session this week, Glen View North legislator, Happymore Chidziva, took Labour and Public Service Minister, Edgar Moyo to task demanding to know what plans are in place to review teachers salaries to meet the poverty datum line and whether there are non-monetary benefits like fuel and housing.\n\nIn response, Moyo dodged the question, hinting that tough times for teachers are set to persist up to year-end.\n\nOur response is that the Government, through the National Joint Negotiating Council (NJNC), is continuously reviewing salaries and conditions of service for teachers and the wider civil service. These reviews are guided by the need to improve the welfare of educators while maintaining fiscal sustainability, he said.\n\nIn addition to salary adjustment, Moyo said the government has introduced several non-monetary incentives including provision of land for housing development, duty-free vehicle importation facility, access to the Government Employees Mutual Savings (GEMS) scheme and ongoing efforts to expand institutional accommodation.\n\nThe ministry continues to engage with relevant stakeholders to explore more innovative ways of cushioning teachers from economic pressures including school-based incentives supported through local communities and responsible authorities, he added.\n\nZimbabwe is one of the few countries, which does not meaningfully reward its teachers and civil servants.\n\nA June 2021 report stated that, comparing with other regional countries, Zimbabwean teachers got way below their peers. In Namibia, tutors earned 24,000 Namibian dollars per month, equivalent to about US$1,759 at that time. In Botswana, teachers salaries range from 5,970 to 22,700 Botswana Pula per month while Lesothos average salary in 2024 was around 11,800 Lesotho Loti (LSL) per month, or about $792.\n\n",

He charged at you and you felt threatened. Your use of a log was, however, disproportionate You were therefore negligent.The court heard that Khumalo is a first offender, left school at Grade 7 due to poverty, and now looks after his sick mother and his late brothers daughter. His mother begged the court for mercy in an emotional plea.The person you killed is your own brother. You will live with this tragic incident for the rest of your life. The mental imprisonment far exceeds the imprisonment which comes with the four corners of a prison cell, Kabasa said.While warning that violence does not solve anything and reminding society to respect the sanctity of life, the judge suspended a three-year prison term for five years.You deserve a second chance, Justice Kabasa ruled.\n\nDelight Khumalo (24) struck his brother twice on the head with a 1.55kg, 186cm log during a midnight scuffle after the deceased stormed into their 60-year-old mothers bedroom hut at 3am, threatening violence.\n\nThe victim later died in hospital from severe brain trauma.Khumalo pleaded guilty to culpable homicide, admitting responsibility but denying intent to kill.Justice Evangelista Kabasa, sitting with two assessors, agreed that now deceaseds actions fuelled violence.The deceased was aggressive and would not listen to your mother.

Hopefully, our explorations of justice in its various forms will also be enhanced, Moyo said.\n\nZHRC Chairperson Jessie Majome also said the collaboration is a public commitment to advance dignity, equality, and freedom by promoting truth, supporting the marginalised.\n\nThis is a public expression of our intention and commitment to working with each other to advance the dignity, equality and freedom of human beings by working with the truth, speaking out and standing for the people who are marginalised.\n\nThis is an indication of our willingness to work together more in strengthening administrative justice and human rights in Zimbabwe for example, exchanging information and referring cases of violations so that we investigate, she added.\n\n",
