            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature, and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. This week we want to discuss public-private partnerships in Zimbabwe, what they are and whether they are a goodconsiderationin theinvestment area.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nAs the name suggests, it is a partnership between the government on behalf of its people and a private player in the development of a particular project. Potential projects capable of investment vary and may range from projects like dam construction, road and rail infrastructure development, power generation and so forth. The opportunities are vast.\n\nThe motivation for the government is to provide its people with the necessary infrastructure at an affordable cost, including in projects where charges are defrayed directly to the public, for example, toll fees, while the motivation of the private sector is to maximise profits.\n\nThese motivations are the underlying guide to the contract negotiation process.\n\nSo in short, a typical Public Private Partnership will have the private company designing, funding, constructing and even implementing the project while the government monitors compliance with the undertakings made in the contract and in some instances allows for concessions within its capacity, like tax incentives to assist in expediting project implementation.\n\nReporter:Are PPPs in Zimbabwe a good area for investment in light of the potential economic risks?\n\nVM: The first thing to consider is that Zimbabwe is a developing country. That being said, it follows that there is a lot of scope where private players can partner up with the government to deliver necessary infrastructure at a profit.\n\nThe issue of risk, which is critical in all negotiations with all governments around the world, can be mitigated by understanding our economic model and laws. Our law makes it a condition precedent before entering any public-private partnership that the company or private party intending to enter into a Public-Private Partnership must undertake a thorough feasibility study of the project.\n\nThis feasibility study will highlight all the potential risks that may emanate from the project and such risks are then allocated to the best party capable of managing or mitigating them in the partnership contract.\n\nReporter: Where will a person contemplating a PPP go in the government to get assistance?\n\nVM: The Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency (ZIDA) and specifically the Public Private Partnership Unit within the agency, is responsible for the examination and review of the project, including its risk allocation. For a project to proceed to implementation, it requires the approval of the PPP unit and the Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion.\n\nIn unsolicited projects, where for instance, a private player has land that can be utilized in PPP to unlock value, the first port of call will obviously be the local council or responsible ministry with a comprehensive proposal outlining its value to the state and corresponding implementation requirements, be it legal, financial or technical.\n\nShould the government body responsible be satisfied with the proposal, it will then refer it to the PPP unit for evaluation. If the PPP unit gives the go-ahead, then the government body can enter negotiations with the private party for a mutually beneficial operating contract.\n\nReporter: What are the main considerations when negotiating a PPP?\n\nVM: It is critical to understand that PPPs are not a one-size-fits-all. Each PPP will address unique issues in a manner appropriate for that particular transaction. The underlying motivation for the parties remaining, as I stated earlier, the government intends to provide infrastructure at the best cost, and the private player intends to maximise as much profit. It is always best to allocate a portion of the profit as a buffer against unforeseen events like an increase in costs, delays in the project, which also have cost consequences, technical defects etc.\n\nAnother key consideration will be the model of the PPP, whether a Build Transfer PPP, a Build Operate and Transfer, Build Lease and Transfer. The type of structure should be one most suited to address projects particular risks.\n\nThe private partner on the other hand, may also be interested in achieving as many fiscal benefits as possible, which may include duty exemptions on capital goods, investment allowances, tax breaks or special rates et cetera.\n\nSpecial attention should also be afforded to the general contract clauses, like your dispute resolution clauses. They should allow provision for negotiated settlements as a first step in this type of contract, then consider alternative methods when negotiation fails. Other key clauses are your step-in, force majeure, and termination clauses as read with the undertakings clauses.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima, we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

            "content": "By UK Correspondent\n\nLabour MP Dawn Butler has withdrawn from an international summit in London after learning she was advertised as a speaker alongsideAuxilliaMnangagwa, Zimbabwes First Lady, who is under US sanctions for alleged corruption and gold smuggling. The decision follows fierce backlash from Zimbabwean activists, who accuse Mnangagwa of hypocrisy and have pledged to disrupt the event with protests.\n\nThe First Ladies of African Impact & Resilience (FLAIR) Summit, due to take place on 17-18 June at the Leonardo Royal Hotelin London, aims to spotlight female leadership and investment in Africa. But Mnangagwas inclusion has ignited controversy, prompting Butlers exit and raising questions about the participation of two other British politicians, Labour MP Diane Abbott and Conservative peer Baroness Sandip Verma.\n\nLabour MP Dawn Butler\n\nIn a statement, Butlers office said: We have never agreed to speaking at this event, so are rightly concerned that Dawn is being advertised as a speaker at this summit. We have contacted the organisers and asked them to remove her name from their programme immediately. The move came after Zimbabwean diaspora activists delivered a petition to 10 Downing Street, calling for Mnangagwa to be barred from the UK.\n\nA Controversial Guest\n\nAuxilliaMnangagwa, married to Zimbabwes President Emmerson Mnangagwa, was sanctioned by the US in 2023 under the Global Magnitsky Act. An Al Jazeera investigation,Gold Mafia, alleged she played a key role in smuggling gold and diamonds, funnelling profits to the ruling elite while Zimbabwes economy crumbled. Over 80% of Zimbabweans are unemployed, and 5.6 million face food insecurity, according to the World Food Programme. Last years elections, widely criticised as fraudulent by the EU, SADCand others, further entrenched the regimes grip on power.\n\nDespite this, Mnangagwa has cast herself as an advocate for womens empowermenta claim activists dismiss as a sham. On 4 June, campaigner JosephineJenje-Mudimbuled a protest outside Downing Street, delivering a petition to block Mnangagwas entry. In a video on X, she said: Charity begins at home.Auxilliashould clean up the mess she and her husband are creating in Zimbabwe. There is no room forAuxilliato come to the UK to present herself at FLAIR.\n\nIve got a message for Auxillia Mnangagwa, the illegitimate First Lady.\n\nThese were the first few words by Josephine Jenje-Mudimbu as she started. She was standing in front of 10 Downing Street in London, on the 4th of June 2025 as part of a protest that was also handing in apic.twitter.com/SbPCPvghXA\n\n Zimbabwe Freedom of Expression (@ZimbabweFreedo1)June 12, 2025\n\nThe outrage has spilled onto social media. X user @MilMillazwrote: AuxilliaMnangagwa must not be given a platform at the #FLAIRSummit. She represents a brutal regime responsible for abductions, mass corruption, and human rights abuses.\n\nPolitical Fallout\n\nButlers withdrawal has turned the spotlight on Abbott and Verma, both still listed as speakers. Abbott, a veteran Labour MP, and Verma, the UKs Ministerial Champion for Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls Overseas, have yet to clarify their stances. For Verma, the stakes are high: her role puts her at odds with sharing a stage with the spouse of a leader linked to state violence. Neither responded to inquiriesemailed to their offices last week.\n\nThe silence has fuelled criticism. Would these MPs sit with the spouse of a Russian oligarch? asked @ChirevoChamisaon X. If not, what makes Zimbabwe different? Activists argue that hosting Mnangagwa undermines the summits stated mission and sends a dangerous signal to Zimbabwean women enduring repression.\n\nThe FLAIR Summits organisers have remained tight-lipped, though sources suggest Mnangagwas participation could be reconsidered as protests mount. With just days until the event, the row exposes a broader dilemma: how to balance diplomatic engagement with accountability for human rights abuses.\n\nAs activists prepare to shut it down, the summits future hangs in the balance.\n\n",

Most of the victims belonged to the minority Ndebele tribe.\n\nMugabe, who died in 2019, never acknowledged responsibility for the massacres, dismissing evidence gathered by Amnesty International as a heap of lies.\n\nAfter taking power in 2017, Mnangagwa promised a resolution and set up a panel of chiefs to probe the massacres.\n\nFlawed process\n\nBut activists said the process was flawed as there had been no official government apology and victims were not consulted.\n\nActivist Mbuso Fuzwayo on Sunday dismissed the initiative as a sham from the start.\n\nThis is being dealt with from the position of the perpetrator and not the victims, he told AFP.\n\nSome of the known perpetrators are people in positions of power and they are the ones who led the initiative from the start, Fuzwayo said.\n\nMnangagwa, who has previously described the massacres as a bad patch in Zimbabwes history, was security minister at the time but has always denied any responsibility.\n\n",

One YouTuber, who makes travel videos based on the wide range of destinations he has visited across the globe, featured Zimbabwe in a recent video and explained exactly why it is Africas most underrated spot. In fact, he went as far as to call it the most underrated country in the world. Tayo Aina showed off what the country has to offer visitors, from thewildlife experiencesto theiconic Victoria Falls.\n\nZimbabwe is located in southern Africa and is landlocked by Zambia, Mozambique,South Africaand Botswana. Home to just over 16 million people, it is a place that is often overlooked by tourists who are looking for the best experiences thatAfricahas to offer. However, that is a mistake according to many, such as this vlogger who calls it one of the most beautiful countries on the planet. Among the things he shows offin the videois Victoria Falls and a fascinating elephant and cheetah experience in which he gets up and close to these animals.\n\nAmong the famous sites in Zimbabwe is the aforementioned Victoria Falls, which is located on the border with Zambia. The Zambezi River plummets over a cliff here and it makes for a magnificent site that rivals that ofNiagra Fallsin the US.\n\nIt is ranked as the number one thing to do in Zimbabwe among Tripadvisor users, receiving rave reviews. One person said: It is one of the most beautiful places in the region, as it is imposing and huge. It is important to carry a raincoat, as we went in May, when the volume of water is high, creating large wet clouds.\n\nAnother wrote: Must see natural wonder of the world. It is impossible to describe how large and massive of a water sheet the falls are. Bring rain poncho!\n\nThe second-highest rated attraction in Zimbabwe is Prinlin Safari Travels, which offers excursions around this region of the country to take in the iconic Victoria Falls and the surrounding area.\n\nThere is also the Wild is Life animal sanctuary, which is home to fascinating creatures such aselephantsand other native wildlife. It is located in the capital city, Harare, which also has plenty of excitement and things to do.\n\nAnother well-reviewed attraction is Hwange National Park, where you can go on a fascinating safari trip to see some of Africas most exciting wildlife and scenery. For wildlife lovers, there is also Matobo National Park, Imire Rhino & Wildlife Conservation and Mukuvisi Woodlands.\n\nRedditusers have provided overwhelmingly positive reviews when it comes to visiting Zimbabwe. One person said: It is absolutely beautiful, and the people are amazing, generally very respectful and friendly.\n\nAnother shared: I was there a few months ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. Itinerary-wise, I hit up Vic Falls, Bulawayo with a day trip to Matobo National Park, Masvingo & the Great Zimbabwe Ruins, Harare and daytrips to the surrounding areas, Mutare & hiking in the Bvumba Mountains, and then a few days of hiking in Chimanimani to finish off. This took me about 3 weeks to do.\n\nThere are a number of airports you can fly into to get to Zimbabwe, depending on where you want to go in the country.\n\nYou can fly to Harare (Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport), Bulawayo (Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo International Airport) and Victoria Falls (Victoria Falls International Airport), changing at airportsalong the way.\n\nIt is clear that many people using the likes of YouTube,TikTokandRedditsee Zimbabwe as one of the most underrated countries in Africa, so it is somewhere that you can discover where none of your friends and family will have likely ever been.\n\n",

But still it was a very good game, said NdirayaScottland is now on 26 points, five points behind log leaders MWOS, who are now on 31 points after salvaging a 2-2 draw at Gibbo Stadium against Triangle.Meanwhile, Kwekwe United coach Paul Chimalizeni saluted his boys for the performance despite losing 1-0.I am happy with the guys, they played very well. Given the quality of players I have, they are inexperienced and looking at how they played against Scottland, l am pleased.I hope we will take it from here and improve going forward, he said.Kwekwe United remains bottom on the log with eight points after 15 games.The league debutants have only won one match this season and remain a favourite candidate for relegation.Matchday 15 resultsScottland 1-0 Kwekwe UnitedHighlanders 2-3 Simba BhoraTriangle United 2-2 MWOSScottland 1-0 Kwekwe UnitedGreen Fuel 0-1 Tel OneFC Platinum 4-0 ZPC KaribaBikita 1-1 DynamosYadah 1-0 HerentalsCAPS United 1-0 Chicken InnNgexi Platinum 1-1 Manica Diamonds.\n\nThe victory saw Tonderai Ndirayas side bouncing back to winning ways after suffering a 1-0 defeat to MWOS a fortnight ago.\n\nScottland could have scored a minimum of three goals in Sundays game but youngster Tadiwanashe Chakuchichi failed to bury two clear chances that were created for him.Besides Chakuchichi, substitute Nathan Mutasa had a final minute clear opportunity after benefitting from Khama Billiats brilliant through pass in the box only for him to directly fire in the goalkeepers hands.In a post match interview, Scottland FC coach Tonderai Ndiraya praised his counterparts for giving them a competitive game.I think it was a very competitive game, I must admit that the new coaches at Kwekwe (United) are doing a very good job.Its a very different team from the one that I watched before, good work from coach Paul Chimalezeni and his backroom staff.We started very well in the early moments of the game until we scored that goal, we then took a backseat and allowed Kwekwe to come back into the game.
