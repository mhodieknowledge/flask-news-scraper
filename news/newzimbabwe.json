            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA 21-year-old gold panner has been sentenced to 20 years in prison after the High Court found him guilty of fatally stabbing a colleague during a drunken quarrel over what to do with a monkey they had failed to sell.\n\nJustice Kabasa, sitting with two assessors, ruled that Mlindeli Siziba used a knife to stab the victim multiple times in the back, puncturing his lungs, after the deceased suggested they give the monkey away. His co-accused, Mthulisi Moyo, was acquitted for lack of evidence.\n\nAll the deceased had done was ask that you give away a monkey. He died because of such a flimsy reason, Justice Kabasa said in her ruling. Why would one use a lethal weapon to stab a human being several times and aim at vital organs if the intention is not to kill?\n\nThe court dismissed Sizibas claim of self-defence, pointing out that the victim was fleeing when attacked.\n\nA person fleeing is no danger to anyone. The ones pursuing are the danger to the one fleeing. What self-defence is that when the victim is attacked from the back?\n\nThe judge condemned the growing use of knives in violent disputes among artisanal miners.\n\nThe use of knives is becoming worrisome and gold panners appear to take knives as the weapon of choice. People ought to respect the sanctity of life. Life is a gift which ought not to be taken away at the hands of another.\n\nSiziba, who left the victim to bleed to death by a riverbank and lied that he was alright, showed no remorse, the court said.\n\nHanding down sentence, Justice Kabasa stressed that deterrence was necessary.\n\nAt 21 you are not so young to deserve a reduction of an otherwise appropriate sentence. There was nothing youthful in your conduct. The presumptive penalty is 20 years. We find no reason to depart from that.\n\nSiziba was jailed for 20 years, while Moyo walked free after being given the benefit of the doubt.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nFrance has formally recognised a Palestinian state, becoming the latest in a wave of countries to take the step.\n\nSpeaking at the UN in New York, President Emmanuel Macron said the time for peace has come and that nothing justifies the ongoing war in Gaza.\n\nUS President Donald Trump is due to address the UN General Assembly on Tuesday, as will the leaders of key regional players such as Jordan and Qatar.\n\nOn Monday, the US did not attend a one-day summit hosted by France and Saudi Arabia which focused on plans for a two-state solution to the conflict. Fellow G7 states Germany and Italy were also absent.\n\nBelgium, Luxembourg, Malta, Andorra and San Marino are also due to recognise a Palestinian state, after the UK, Canada, Australia and Portugal announced recognition on Sunday.\n\nInternational pressure is ramping up on Israel over the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza and settlement building in the West Bank.\n\nIsrael has said recognition would reward Hamas for the Palestinian armed groups 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.\n\nMore than 65,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since, according to Gazas Hamas-run health ministry. Israeli forces are currently carrying out a ground offensive aimed at taking control of Gaza City, where a million people were living and a famine was confirmed last month.\n\nThe French leader told the conference that the time had come to stop the war and free the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas. He warned against the peril of endless wars and said right must always prevail over might.\n\nThe international community had failed to build a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, he said, adding that we must do everything in our power to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution that would see Israel and Palestine side by side in peace and security.\n\nSaudi Arabias Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud also addressed the UN, on behalf of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nHe reiterated that a two-state solution was the only way to achieve lasting peace in the region.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would set up a new financial instrument to work on Gazas reconstruction.\n\nWe must all do more, she told the UN General Assembly. This is why we will set up a Palestine Donor Group.\n\nUN secretary general Antonio Guterres referred to the situation in Gaza as morally, legally and politically intolerable and said a two-state solution was the only credible path for peace between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas  who was blocked from attending the UN General Assembly in person after the US revoked his and other Palestinian officials visas  addressed the conference via videolink.\n\nHe called for a permanent ceasefire and said Hamas could have no role in governing Gaza, calling for the group to surrender their weapons to the Palestinian Authority (PA).\n\nWhat we want is one unified state without weapons, he said.\n\nAbbas also condemned Hamass 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel and addressed Israelis, saying: Our future and yours depends on peace. Enough violence and war.\n\nReuters Israel has been bombarding Gaza City as its forces push deeper into the city\n\nMacron said France was ready to contribute to a stabilisation mission in Gaza and called for a transitional administration involving the PA that would oversee the dismantling of Hamas.\n\nHe said France would only open an embassy to a Palestinian state when all the hostages being held by Hamas are released and a ceasefire had been agreed.\n\nIsraels ambassador to the UN, Danny Dannon, spoke to reporters shortly before Macrons announcement.\n\nDannon said a two-state solution was taken off the table after the 7 October attack and called this weeks talks at the UN a charade. He also refused to rule out Israel annexing the occupied West Bank.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted there will be no Palestinian state to the west of the River Jordan, and President Isaac Herzog said recognising one would only embolden the forces of darkness.\n\nAhead of Macrons announcement, the Palestinian and Israeli flags were displayed on the Eiffel Tower on Sunday night. A number of town halls in France also flew Palestinian flags on Monday, despite a government order to local prefects to maintain neutrality.\n\nPro-Palestinian protests also took place in some80 towns and cities across Italy, where Giorgia Melonis government said recently it could be counter-productive to recognise a state that did not exist.\n\nIn Germany, the government has said Palestinian statehood is not currently up for debate, and Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul explained as he left for New York on Monday that, For Germany, recognition of a Palestinian state comes more at the end of the process. But this process must begin now.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Bulawayo High Court has handed a decisive victory to Chinese-owned Chengbao Mining (Pvt) Ltd, declaring its tribute agreement over C-Mine in Mberengwa valid and binding, while ordering rival parties to vacate the disputed site and account for minerals already extracted.\n\nIn a recent judgment, Justice Bongani Ndlovu ruled that Chengbaos October 2024 agreement with Anesu Gold (Pvt) Ltd remained in force, despite claims by Anesu Gold and miner Allen Sibanda that the deal had been cancelled.\n\nIt is declared that the Tribute Agreement  is still valid and effective, and binding on the 1st Respondent and the Applicant, Justice Ndlovu said, stressing that the contract could not be unilaterally cancelled outside its agreed procedures.\n\nThe dispute erupted in November 2024 when Anesu Gold, which had already signed a tribute agreement with Chengbao Mining, went on to enter a separate arrangement with Sibanda, giving him control of the same mining claims. Chengbao accused Anesu Gold of double-dealing, while Sibanda claimed the first deal had been cancelled.\n\nThe wrangle quickly escalated on the ground, with both parties moving equipment and workers onto the site. Chengbao maintained that it had invested heavily in infrastructure and environmental certification under the original contract, while Anesu Gold and Sibanda insisted the agreement was no longer binding.\n\nThe court found that Anesu Gold had improperly attempted to replace Chengbao with Sibanda under a rival tribute arrangement, despite the existing deal.\n\nI find no basis to accept the 1st respondents version that the 2nd agreement was entered into only for the purpose of obtaining an EIA certificate. This court will not rewrite the agreement for the parties, but will give effect to it, adhering to the cardinal rule of pacta sunt servanda, ruled Justice Ndlovu.\n\nAs part of the order, Sibanda and all those claiming through him must remove their mining equipment from C-Mine, failing which the Sheriff and police will forcibly evict them. The court also directed both Sibanda and Anesu Gold to account for all minerals extracted since November 2024, with a chartered accountant appointed to audit the proceeds.\n\nWhat the applicant would have managed to gain from the mining activities  ought to be accounted for and returned, the judge ordered.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nZimbabwes plans to stage their 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifier against South Africa in Francistown have been scuppered by the Botswana Football Association (BFA), which confirmed that the Francistown Sports Complex is unavailable.\n\nThe venue will host Botswanas own qualifier against Uganda on 9 October, just a day before the scheduled meeting between the Warriors and Bafana Bafana. That clash of dates contravenes FIFA regulations, which require that visiting teams be given access to match venues the day before a fixture.\n\nThe impasse now points to Zimbabwe relocating their home game to South Africa, with two familiar options in the frame: Orlando Stadium in Johannesburg and Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. Both arenas have served as temporary home grounds in previous years when Zimbabwean facilities failed to meet international standards.\n\nReports at the weekend suggested Moses Mabhida was the favoured choice, though no confirmation has come from the South African Football Association, as the final decision rests with the Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa).\n\nIn the meantime, Zifa has bristled at the BFAs handling of the matter, condemning its public announcement as premature. Spokesperson Mike Madoda said: It is Zifas prerogative to pick a venue that suits our interests. Zimbabwe will always make decisions that are in the interests of the Warriors and Zimbabwean football.\n\nMadoda also rejected speculation that Zifa had been swayed by financial inducements to stage the match in South Africa, dismissing such claims as baseless. He underlined that venue selection remains an internal process, carried out with independence and integrity.\n\nThe dispute underscores the undercurrents of regional rivalry in Southern African football, where off-field logistics often intertwine with long-standing national competition.\n\nFor Zimbabwe, the bigger picture is already clear: their World Cup campaign is over after a torrid run produced only four points from eight matches, leaving them bottom of Group C without a win. The Warriors struggles mark a sobering end to their qualification hopes.\n\nBy contrast, Bafana Bafana are riding high. Coach Hugo Broos has moulded a side that sits atop the group with 17 points, galvanised by cohesion, tactical discipline and growing belief. South Africa are now on the brink of confirming their place at the 2026 finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nStill, the fixture between neighbours carries significance beyond mathematics. Zimbabwes captain Knowledge Musona has promised his side will fight for pride: We may not have lived up to our hopes in the tournament, but we want to ensure we leave everything on the pitch against South Africa.\n\nThe clash, whenever and wherever it is finally staged, will serve as both a test of Bafana Bafanas momentum and a chance for Zimbabwe to reassert their footballing pride, ensuring the rivalry burns as fiercely as ever.\n\n",
