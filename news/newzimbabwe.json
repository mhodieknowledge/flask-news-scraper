For example, a supermarket must obtain separate bakery, butchery, restaurant, and liquor licences to operate fully.\n\nNcube, who last year told the Womens Prosperity Conference that his wife had presented him with a long list of licences required before opening her restaurant, admitted the system was excessive.\n\nOn the issue of licences, I totally agree with what women in business are saying. Just recently, my wife showed me a very long list of licences she had to pay before opening a restaurant in Bulawayo. Its just too much for a single business, Ncube said at the time, promising urgent reforms.\n\nNcube on Wednesday unveiled a raft of measures aimed at reducing the cost of doing business and improving Zimbabwes competitiveness.\n\nThe first tranche, which is targeting the agricultural value chain, has seen the requirement for a Small Scale Farmers registration fees of US$500 being scrapped, while the Dairy Processor Registration of US$350 per annum being reduced to a once-off US$50.\n\nFeed manufacturing registration fees were reduced from US$250 to US$20 while livestock movement clearance which attracted US$10 per herd, will now require US$5 per herd.\n\nThe livestock genetics import permit, which was pegged at US$100 will now attract just US$20 while the meat export registration, which was pegged at US$500 will now attract US$100.\n\nOther measures include scrapping food handler certificate fees and capping Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) costs at 0.05% of project value, with a maximum of US$100,000.\n\nThe Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA) livestock levy, biosafety permit, and the CBCA certificate are also among the charges that have been scrapped.\n\nThese reforms are part of governments commitment to ease the cost of doing business and create a more competitive economic environment, Ncube said.\n\nNew Licensing Fees\n\n",

            "content": "The Guardian\n\nAuthorities in the US were still searching for a suspect in the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, hours after the close ally ofDonald Trumpwas killed at a Utah university, sparking condemnation from both sides of politics and grave threats from the president.\n\nThis shooting is still an active investigation, theUtahdepartment of public safety said in a statement, adding it was working with the FBI and local police departments.\n\nTwo suspects were taken into custody, but subsequently released. The Governor of Utah, Spencer Cox, called it a political assassination, despite the motive and identity of the shooter remaining unclear.\n\nBeau Mason, the commissioner of Utahs department of public safety, said investigators were reviewing security camera images of the suspect, who wore dark clothing and possibly fired a longer distance shot from a roof.\n\nIn a video message from the Oval Office, Trump vowed that his administration would track down the suspect.\n\nMy administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organisations that fund it and support it, Trump said.\n\nKirkwas shot while addressing a crowdof an estimated 3,000 people at Utah Valley University in Orem, near Salt Lake City. Video footage posted online showed Kirk being questioned by an audience member about gun violencein the moments before he was shot.\n\nVideo footage shows students scrambling to run from the sound of gunfire. Kirk was transported to a nearby hospital, where he later died, authorities said.\n\nLocal officials said the shooting was believed to be a targeted attack by a shooter from the roof of a building.\n\nHis death prompted outrage from Democrats and Republicans, while the president ordered flags to be lowered to half mast to honour him.\n\nThis is a dark day for our state. Its a tragic day for our nation, Cox, a Republican, said at a press conference, appealing for an end to the political violence.\n\nKirkwas the co-founder of Turning Point USA, the largest conservative youth organisation in the country which, played a key role in driving young voter support for Trump in November.\n\nHis appearances on podcasts and across social media brought him fame and notoriety, as he helped to amplify the presidents agenda. Kirk frequently attacked the mainstream media and engaged with culture-war issues around race, gender and immigration, often in a provocative style.\n\nThe event in Utah on Wednesday was the first in his American Comeback Tour at universities around the country. He often used such events, which typically drew large crowds of students, to invite attendees to debate him live.\n\nExperts have warned his death marks a watershed moment, with fears it could inflame an already fractured country and inspire more unrest.\n\nTrump, who routinely describes political rivals and others who stand in his way as radical left lunatics who pose an existential threat to the nation, decried violent political rhetoric in his statement on Wednesday night.\n\nViolence and murder are the tragic consequences of demonising those you disagree with  For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the worlds worst mass murderers and criminals, he said.\n\nPromising to crackdown on political violence, the president cited recent incidents including the attempts on his life last year, the killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson and the 2017 shooting of Republican congressman Steve Scalise.\n\nThe presidents list notably did not include violence against Democrats, such asthe murder of Melissa Hortman, a Minnesota state lawmaker, and her husband, or the attack on former House speakerNancy Pelosis husband.\n\nFormer president Barack Obama condemned political violence as despicable, while sending his prayers to Kirks wife and two young children. Joe Biden said there was no no place in our country for this kind of violence.\n\nHakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House minority leader, expressed a similar sentiment: Political violence of any kind and against any individual is unacceptable and completely incompatible with American values.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, an attempt to observe a moment of silence for Kirk on the floor of the House of Representatives degenerated into shouting and finger-pointing. Republican representative Anna Paulina Luna, who worked as Kirks director of Hispanic engagement at Turning Point USA yelled at Democrats, telling them You caused this!\n\nThat prompted Democratic representative Jahana Hayes, a leader on the gun violence prevention taskforce, to shout: Pass some gun laws!\n\nThe US is undergoing its most sustained period of political violence since the 1970s, according to data compiled by the Reuters news agency, which has documented more than 300 cases of politically motivated violent acts since supporters of Trump attacked the US Capitol on 6 January 6 2021.\n\nIn the first six months of the year, the US experienced about 150 politically motivated attacks, nearly twice as many as over the same period last year, Mike Jensen, a researcher at the University of Maryland, told Reuters.\n\nI think we are in a very, very dangerous spot right now that could quite easily escalate into more widespread civil unrest if we dont get a hold of it, Jensen said. This could absolutely serve as a kind of flashpoint that inspires more of it.\n\nWith Reuters\n\n",

The drugs had an estimated street value of US$96.20.\n\nChambati admitted the charge and was convicted, but the magistrate gave her a suspended jail term and 420 hours of community service, citing her guilty plea, remorse and her status as a mother.\n\nJustice Muremba said the magistrate misapplied the Criminal Procedure (Sentencing Guidelines) Regulations, 2023, which set a presumptive penalty of three years imprisonment for cases involving large quantities of drugs or possession in public spaces.\n\nThe sentence imposed was not only inconsistent with the regulatory framework but also failed to reflect the structured approach intended to promote fairness, proportionality, and consistency in sentencing, Justice Muremba ruled.\n\nMuremba criticised the magistrates view that 962.6g was a small amount, saying precedent showed even 700g warranted prison time. Citing past cases, the judge said: Quantities well below this threshold constitute substantial amounts.\n\nThe judge stressed that being caught at a busy shopping mall aggravated the offence: Possession of dangerous drugs in a public setting attracts the presumptive penalty of three years imprisonment.\n\nWhile confirming Chambatis conviction, Justice Muremba refused to certify the sentence, leaving the door open for a harsher penalty.\n\nLenient sentences such as community service for possession of nearly a kilogram of dagga fall short of the justice systems duty to protect society, she warned.\n\n",

            "content": "ByPeter Fabricius,Daily Maverick\n\nSince his arrest on 13 April, Wellington Masiwa has been in prison for illegally entering South Africa and for alleged fraud in Zimbabwe.\n\nZimbabwean opposition activists believe the South African authorities are colluding with Zimbabwes ruling Zanu-PF party to extradite a vocal critic of the Zimbabwean government from South Africa to Zimbabwe.\n\nWellington Masiwa, aka Comrade Nyokayemabhunu, has been detained in the Johannesburg Correctional Centre since he was arrested on 13 April for illegally entering South Africa and for alleged fraud in Zimbabwe.\n\nBefore that, he was held and assaulted by unknown men in an unknown place, according to his legal representatives.\n\nWhen he appeared in the Randburg Magistrates Court on 30 April on an illegal immigration charge, his lawyers were surprised when an Interpol representative showed up and laid new charges against him based on an extradition request from the Zimbabwean government.\n\nWhen the representative appeared in court at a later hearing in July, the crowd of opposition Zimbabwean citizens supporting Masiwa grew angry, suspecting new charges were being brought against him.\n\nSouth Africas justice minister, Mmamoloko Kubayi, is expected to rule this week on whether Masiwa is extraditable.\n\nThe extradition notice from Zimbabwes deputy prosecutor-general, Nelson Mutsonziwa, certified that Zimbabwe wanted him returned to serve an 18-month sentence for defrauding a fellow Zimbabwean, Prince Kutivo, of $3,660 in a fraudulent property deal in Harare.\n\nThis request is not being pursued for political reasons or any ulterior purpose, Mutsonziwa insisted.\n\nHowever, there are many anomalies in the case which cast doubt on Mutsonziwas assurances. For instance, another alleged fraud case against Masiwa has arisen. Masiwa says that he was arrested through a trap set by Zimbabwes notorious Central Intelligence Organisation and sprung by a fellow Zimbabwean activist, Honest Sibanda.\n\nThis appears to be another name for Honest Shumba, who has formally charged Masiwa with cheating him of some R24,000, which he paid Masiwa in Harare in July 2024 for a couch which Masiwa never delivered.\n\nMasiwa flatly denies the deal and says he was in South Africa when the transaction allegedly occurred.\n\nMasiwas attorney, Yugeshnee Govender, told Daily Maverick the prosecution had been unable to produce bank statements to prove Shumba paid this money into Masiwas bank account. The Zimbabwean government has not mentioned the Shumba case in its request for extradition.\n\nMasiwa, his lawyers and his opposition comrades believe the Shumba incident was invented to strengthen Zimbabwes case for his extradition. They believe the real reason the Zimbabwe government wants him home is that he has been a strident critic of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, and particularly of his political manoeuvring to try to secure a third term when his second  and constitutionally, final  term expires in 2028.\n\nUntil shortly before his arrest, Masiwa was posting calls on X and other social media, calling on Zimbabweans to join a national shutdown on 31 March to protest at Mnangagwas suspected plans to bypass or amend the Constitution so as to remain in power.\n\nIn an affidavit before the Randburg Magistrates Court seeking bail  which has so far been denied  Masiwa said that before his arrest he had had a WhatsApp channel called Nyokayemabhunu News.\n\nIt had been an important instrument in protest news in Zimbabwe. Masiwa said he was opposed to the campaign for the extension of Mnangagwas presidential term, which had come to be known as 2030 by Zanu-PF.\n\nThe extension is not in terms of the Zimbabwean Constitution, he said, insisting he had only advocated for peaceful means to stop the illegal subversion of the Zimbabwean Constitution by the ruling party in Zimbabwe, Zanu-PF. It is for this reason that I have been declared an enemy of the state by the Zimbabwean government and Zanu-PF.\n\nZanu-PF has called several press conferences to celebrate my arrest in South Africa and have indicated that they would want to charge me with terrorism for illegally attempting to remove a constitutionally elected government  which carries the death penalty.\n\nThe Progressive Zimbabwean Foundation, which says it represents numerous progressive forces and pressure groups, issued a statement in August expressing concern that Zimbabwes request for the extradition of Masiwa was political rather than legal.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Cde Nyokayemabhunus arrest and detention raise serious concerns about the separation of politics from the justice system, particularly in a foreign nation like South Africa, said the foundations General Sithole.\n\nHe added that remarks by Zanu-PFs secretary for information and publicity, Chris Mutsvangwa, further reinforces the notion that this is a political matter.\n\nDuring a press conference at Zanu-PF headquarters in Harare on 8 May, Mutsvangwa said Zanu-PF was very happy that South Africa had taken steps to show that it was not prepared to tolerate Zanu-PFs critics using South Africa as a platform for their criticism.\n\nMentioning Nyokayemabhunu by name, he said, Some people have got the mistaken idea that you can go and be hosted in South Africa and start shouting bad things about Zimbabwe and talking subversion.\n\nThey have got a new comeuppance by South African laws. They are being told: Not here. We are a sister republic to Zimbabwe. We fought with Zanu-PF. We know each other. This is not your home.\n\nMutsvangwa said he hoped the legal action that South Africa was taking against Masiwa is a signal to others who are spewing hatred and vituperation  about Zanu-PF and our leader that South Africa cant tolerate. It cant be a home for vitriol against Zimbabwe.\n\nHowever, South African Police Service Captain Willem van der Heever testified, in a court affidavit responding to Masiwa, that the conviction in Zimbabwe has nothing to do with the political climate in Zimbabwe.\n\nVan der Heever said he was Interpols investigating officer in this matter, stationed at the Interpol extradition desk in Pretoria and that he had received Zimbabwes request for extradition through Interpol and had obtained a warrant for Masiwas arrest from the Kempton Park Magistrates Court on the basis of it on 29 April.\n\nVan der Heever cited deputy prosecutor-general Mutsonziwas certificate stating that Zimbabwe was only seeking Masiwas extradition to serve an 18-month sentence in the 2016 case for fraud against Kutivo.\n\nYet in his affidavit Van der Heever also cited Honest Shumbas alleged couch fraud complaint.\n\nGovender told Daily Maverick that Masiwa and his legal team were waiting for Justice Minister Kubayi to decide whether Masiwas case was extraditable. Govender said she believed the amount of the alleged fraud involved in this case was not great enough to warrant extradition.\n\nGovender said Kubayis ruling on this might be announced when Masiwa appeared in court again on 10 September. Masiwa said he fled Zimbabwe in 2017, fearing for his safety after being beaten by government agents after Mnangagwa ousted President Robert Mugabe in a coup.\n\nMasiwa now lives in Gqeberha with his wife and is a granite cutter. He has applied for political asylum in South Africa, but his court cases have interrupted his application.DM\n\n",

            "content": "Metro UKs foreign correspondent Gergana Krasteva reports from Zimbabwe\n\nBeads of sweat drip down Gilbert Nuovus forehead as the memories of working inone of Zimbabwes gold minesrush back in.\n\nOver a year ago, the dad-of-two deserted his job after a colleague was killed when the walls of the pit caved in, burying him alive.\n\nA friend of mine died on the spot. I was afraid for my life, so I went back home, he tellsMetro.\n\nThe road into Matabeleland North, 150 miles from the city of Bulawayo, is uneven and thick with dust, but I am assured that it will eventually lead to a gold mine.\n\nIt is one of the many precious materials for which the land here has been exploited since before British colonial rule, with the first extractions made as early as the 14th century.\n\nAs our SUV crawls forward, a line of workers stretches along the footpath  boys barely into their teens and weathered men three times their age.\n\nMost are wearing the same faded blue overalls, and chipped shovels slung over their shoulders  a sign theyworkin one of the legal mines.\n\nMatabeleland North sits on some of the richest deposits of gold in Africa, and so is plagued with artisanal pits, which are not officially registered with thegovernment, making them illegal.\n\nYet, tens of thousands of men and women are forced into the trade due to unemployment, making up the majority of the mining workforce.\n\nGordon Sibanda used to be one of them.\n\nMetrospeaks with him at the Libeni PrimarySchool, where he volunteers as a chef to somehow contribute to the local community while searching for work.\n\nSitting on a wooden log and smoothing his cooking apron, he admits that poverty is what drove him to mining in 2001, when he was 39.\n\nHe says: A friend introduced me to the trade. Many of my friends are still in the pits to this day.\n\nMining is strenuous labor. You can spend months searching for a mineral you cannot see and do not know if it is actually in the earth.\n\nAnd when luck would fall on our side, you may get something.\n\nIn Zimbabwes mines, death never seems far.\n\nSo when I ask Gordon if any of his colleagues were injured or killed in the pits, he replies, almost nonchalantly, as he takes off his woolen beanie: Ah yes. Three have been killed when the mines collapsed.\n\nDisintegrated shafts, explosions, flooding  each shift carries the chance that a worker will not return home.\n\nAs many as 237 people died in incidents in 2023, making it one of the very worst years in the countrys mining history.\n\nAnd up until May this year, 59 fatal incidents were reported  most in illegal mines, like the one that Gordon worked in.\n\nTo fully comprehend the vast scale of illegal mining,Metrosits down with Pumulu Masu, government school inspector, who says that most people in Matabeleland North dig without a permit, which means the state does not profit from it.\n\nMostly, people in the area mine illegally, she explains. Lets say there is an agricultural field. Instead of a farm, they will turn it into a mine.\n\nEven in their personal properties  behind their homes  people start to dig.\n\nWe can always tell by the maps of soil. If people suspect there is gold, they will always dig no matter what the land is.\n\nWhile Gordon worked in an illegal pit, Gilbert has experience in a registered mine.\n\nTheir only piece of advice  what they want everyone to know  is do not do it, do not work in a mine, pointing to how deadly the trade is.\n\nGilbert says: The pit is not that strong as miners often dig tunnels [without much planning], making the walls weak.\n\nWe are not given helmets or boots to protect us. It is difficult to survive.\n\nThe work is just too much. In mines, there are no set working hours.You work and you stop when it is time to eat, then you go back to work. It is continuous, we do not stop.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, mining runs through generations like a vein of gold itself. It is often seen as a rite of passage for children as young as nine, and at the same time a lifeline for families in the depths of poverty.\n\nThough the pay is still meagre. All the money Gordon earned was spent on food for his large family, all 13 of them.\n\nAt the time, he was the sole breadwinner for his wife, three sons and three daughters, his own parents and siblings.\n\nHand to mouth, nothing else [is left], he adds, gesturing at his grandson, a four-year-old boy playing with his friends a few metres away.\n\nYet, despite facing unemployment, Gordon has not given mining another thought because of the precarious conditions.\n\nLike him, Gilbert also did not live a life of luxury  but he was under no such illusions when he picked up a shovel.\n\nAfter three months of digging, he was paid around $20, and only after gold was actually discovered. Miners divvy up half the proceeds, while the rest goes straight to the owners pocket.\n\nThere are other dangers too.\n\nThe industry has long been linked to human rights abuses, environmental violations and labour exploitation, particularly in lithium mines operated byChina, despite denials by Zimbabwes government. About 70% of all lithium is processed there.\n\nRobert Mugabes successor, president Emmerson Mnangagwa, of ZANU-PF, has so far supported the takeovers, arguing they will bring economic growth.\n\nPerhaps this has materialised in the capital, Harare; yet, on the ground, in Matabeleland North, the mines have brought little benefits  if any  to the local community.\n\nMetrogained access to Turk, one of the oldest gold mines in Zimbabwe, located in the Bubbi District.\n\nArmed security usually guard gold mines, but today luck has fallen on our side  at least for a few minutes.\n\nPiles of reddish earth and stones mount inside the compound. A dragline excavator in the distance seems to have dosed off, but only momentarily.\n\nThe mine itself gapes before us, an abyss carved so deep and wide that, when peering over the edge, the bottom is not visible.\n\nAcross the road from the pit, a supermarket and two bars stand shoulder to shoulder, their doors flung wide open. A few men have gathered around a plastic table, kicking dust with their feet as they chat.\n\nThis is the heart of what is accepted as the traditional mining community in Zimbabwe.\n\nThere are no clinics or schools, or in fact any other reliable infrastructure apart from the mine.\n\nBars are always the first to spring up whenever gold is unearthed, offering miners a place to unwind and spend their hard-earned cash in.\n\nAs I come to learn, this has also led to alcohol abuse among workers who use drinking as a coping mechanism.\n\nA source, who wished to remain anonymous, tellsMetro: You cannot put a figure on how many people have died because of it. Some have been found dead on pavements.\n\nWorkers deaths are often blamed on the rise in popularity of an illicit brew called krango, which can cause severe organ damage, and is associated with soaring rates of binge drinking.\n\nMy source explains that it is mostly made from ethanol concentrate diluted with large amounts of water, adding: Krango is what it is all about in rural areas. It is packed in bottles of 250ml.\n\nSanctions on Zimbabwe were first introduced in the early 2000s, mainly by the UK, the EU, and the US, amid allegations of human rights abuses, electoral fraud, and Robert Mugabes land reform programme.\n\nThese measures are not broad trade embargoes. They focus on asset freezes and travel bans on senior government officials linked to the state.\n\nThe US also brought out the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act (ZDERA) in 2001, which restricted its access to international financial institutions.\n\nWhile the sanctions target political elites, the Zimbabwean government argues they have deterred foreign investment and limited lines of credit  so much so that the now vice president Constantino Chiwenga said the country had lost more than $150 billion.\n\nSome are even packed by legitimate companies. It is sold for just $0.50, and the strength is usually around 40% strength.\n\nDespite the reported issues plaguing Zimbabwes mines, the government is hellbent on expanding the industry  the faster, the better.\n\nFor a nation that fought so hard to rid itself from colonial rule, it now relies on investors from China, South Africa, Australia, Canada and the UK, and it is eager to attract more.\n\nThe sector as a whole accounts for more than 60% of export revenues and 13% of gross domestic product (GDP), according to national statistics from 2023.\n\nTo increase those numbers, the Zimbabwean government introduced the Vision 2030 plan to become an upper-middle-income economy by the end of the decade.\n\nSupposedly, one of the key objectives is to grow the mining sector to have a revenue of $12 billion per year.\n\nIt makes money, that is for sure, though not for the small miner like Gordon or Gilbert.\n\nThey are currently unemployed and living with the memories of the hell inside the mines.\n\n",

            "content": "Al Jazeera\n\nPolish and NATO forces have shot down drones violating the countrys airspace during a Russian aerial attack on neighbouring Ukraine.\n\nFighter jets were scrambled early on Wednesday as more than a dozen drones entered Polish airspace, the Polish military said. It is the first time that Polish and NATO forces have become engaged in the conflict. Ukraine said Russia is testing the West.\n\nDuring todays attack by the Russian Federation on targets in Ukraine, our airspace was repeatedly violated by drones, the Operational Command of the Polish military said in a statement.\n\nAt the request of the Operational Commander of the Armed Forces, weapons have been used, and operations are under way to locate the downed targets, the military said.\n\nThe army said Polish and NATO military aircraft were mobilised to ensure airspace safety.\n\nPolish and allied aircraft are operating in our airspace, while ground-based air defence and radar reconnaissance systems have been brought to the highest state of readiness, the Operational Command said.\n\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed that an operation is under way related to multiple violations of Polish airspace.\n\nTrwa operacja zwizana z wielokrotnym naruszeniem polskiej przestrzeni powietrznej. Przeciwko obiektom wojsko uyo uzbrojenia. Jestem w staym kontakcie z Prezydentem i Ministrem Obrony. Odebraem bezporedni meldunek od dowdcy operacyjnego.\n\n Donald Tusk (@donaldtusk)September 10, 2025\n\nTranslation: An operation is under way related to multiple violations of Polish airspace. The military used armaments against the objects. I am in constant contact with the president and the minister of defence. I received a direct report from the operational commander.\n\nAn operation was also conducted to collect debris from the drones.\n\nA drone or similar object struck a residential building in Wyryki in eastern Poland, but nobody was injured, its mayor told the state-run news channel TVP Info. Footage showed a house with a damaged roof and the rafters showing.\n\nPolice in the Lublin region said they found a damaged drone in the village of Czosnowka while drone debris was also reported in the town of Czesniki.\n\nTusk confirmed that the drones originated from Russia. We are dealing with a large-scale provocation, the prime minister said.\n\nMoscow appeared to distance itself from the incident. The Russian Ministry of Defence said its drones had struck military facilities in western Ukraine but there were no plans to target sites in Poland.\n\nEarlier, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said the European Union and NATO accuse Russia of provocations on a daily basis, most of the time without even trying to present at least some kind of argument.\n\nTusk said he was in constant contact with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte. An emergency meeting of the Polish Council of Ministers was called for Wednesday.\n\nAircraft have used weapons against hostile objects, Defence Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said on social media, adding: We are in constant contact with NATO command.\n\nUkraines foreign minister said on Wednesday that the events show Russian President Vladimir Putins impunity and his expansion of the war and added that Moscow is testing the Wests willingness to respond to aggression.\n\nPutin just keeps escalating, expanding his war, and testing the West, Andrii Sybiha said on X.\n\nThis situation shows that finally the decision needs to be taken to enable partner air defence capabilities in neighbouring countries to be used to intercept drones and missiles in the Ukrainian airspace, including those approaching NATO borders.\n\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy said eight Russian drones had been aimed toward Poland, and called the episode an extremely dangerous precedent for Europe.\n\nEU Defence Commissioner Andrius Kubilius called for the EU to develop a drone wall along its eastern flank.\n\nOnce again Russia tests frontier states, EU & NATO, Kubilius wrote in a post on social media. We shall work together with Member States, frontier countries and Ukraine. Russia will be stopped.\n\nRussias war is escalating, not ending. We must raise the cost on Moscow, strengthen support for Ukraine, and invest in Europes defence. The EU plays a major role and we will support initiatives like the Eastern Border Shield defence line, the EUs top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, wrote on social media.\n\nThe United States also questioned Moscows intentions after the incident with President Donald Trump weighing in on Truth Social: Whats with Russia violating Polands airspace with drones? Here we go!\n\nFour airports in Poland, including Chopin Airport in Warsaw, were closed due to military activity late on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to notices posted on the US Federal Aviation Administrations website, the other airports closed were Rzeszow-Jasionka Airport, Warsaw Modlin Airport and Lublin Airport.\n\nChopin Airport confirmed later in a post on social media that airspace over parts of Poland, including over the airport, had been closed temporarily due to the actions of state services and the military to ensure safety.\n\nPassengers whose travel plans were disrupted were asked to monitor airlines and official government announcements for updates.\n\nEarly on Wednesday, all of the airports save for Lublin, which is close to the border with Ukraine, reopened.\n\nWany komunikat dla pasaerw korzystajcych z@ChopinAirport.pic.twitter.com/kN1W7dFSLx\n\n Chopin Airport, WAW (@ChopinAirport)September 10, 2025\n\nThe military mobilisation in Poland came after Ukraines air force reported that Russian drones had entered Polish airspace, posing a threat to the city of Zamosc, but the air force later removed the statement from its Telegram messaging app.\n\nMost of Ukraine, including the western regions of Volyn and Lviv, which border Poland, were under air raid alerts for several hours overnight, according to Ukraines air force data.\n\nPoland said earlier that it planned to close its border with Belarus at midnight on Thursday (22:00 GMT on Wednesday) due to Russian-led military exercises scheduled to take place in Belarus.\n\nRussia and Belaruss large-scale military exercises, known as the Zapad drills, have raised security concerns in neighbouring Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, all NATO member states. The Zapad-2025 (West-2025) drills will be held in western Russia and Belarus from Friday.\n\nAsked about the duration of the border closure, Polish Minister of Interior Marcin Kierwinski said the border would only be reopened when the government was sure there was no more threat to Polish citizens.\n\nThe Belarusian Ministry of Foreign Affairs said it had summoned the Polish charge daffaires to complain about the border closure, which it said caused significant difficulties.\n\nIt described Polands move as an abuse of its geographical position.\n\nThe temporary suspension of passage indicates rather an intention to conceal ones own actions than the existence of any threat from Belarus, the Foreign Ministry said.\n\nLithuanias border guard said on Tuesday that the protection of its border with Belarus and Russia would be strengthened due to the exercises.\n\n",
