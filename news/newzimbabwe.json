Prosecutors said it had been ordered by the Russian mercenary group Wagner.\n\nThe ringleader, Dylan Earl, was the first person convicted under the National Security Act, which gives prosecutors powers to put spying suspects on trial in a wider set of circumstances.\n\nLast week, the head of the UKs MI5 security service, Ken McCallum, alleged that Russia is committed to causing havoc and destruction.\n\nIn the last year, we and the police have disrupted a steady stream of surveillance plots with hostile intent aimed at individuals [whom] Russian leaders perceive as their enemies, he said.\n\nThe Kremlin has denied accusations that it is involved in any such acts of sabotage, saying the British government repeatedly blames Russia for anything bad that happens in the UK.\n\n",

            "content": "By Takudzwa Nyambi, Glamour South Africa\n\nOver the past few years weve witnessed a renaissance on the continent when it comes to African culture and creativity. Fashion houses reference Accra streetwear in Paris runways. Amapiano is the unofficial soundtrack of Berlin clubs. Nollywood stars are headlining Netflix features.\n\nAccording to a 2023 UNESCO report, Africas film and audiovisual sector already employs around five million people and generates $5 billion annually. With proper investment, the broader cultural and creative industries could pull in $20 billion a year and create 20 million jobs. This is soft power and real economic transformation.\n\nAfricas creative future wont be written in isolation. Marcus Garvey once envisioned a global Black network, the diaspora and continent working hand in hand. A century later, that vision is finding its feet in people like Fungai Zvirawa, the Zimbabwean advertising executive who built her chops in London boardrooms only to bring them back to Harare, determined to stitch together a local industry that could stand tall on the global stage.\n\nI was raised in South East London by two fiercely patriotic Zimbabwean parents, she recalls. Like many immigrants, I had my share of go back to your country. But instead of breaking me, those words reminded me that I did have a country. That sense of belonging became her compass. The moment crystallized in 2002 when she watched Robert Mugabe address the UN. Politics aside, his message of sovereignty and youth empowerment struck something deep within me. It was a reminder I had a home, a heritage, and a responsibility.\n\nAfter nearly three decades abroad, Fungai Zvirawa returned, stumbling at first, but eventually planting firm roots. It took me four attempts as a returnee to really break ground, she admits. There have been incredible wins and an equal share of losses, but thats the reality of building in Africa. She shares about keeping it simple, embracing culture, and resisting the urge to impose a foreign mindset.\n\nThat mindset birthed Khaya Defero, her cultural events company, and Rogue & Associates, her boutique ad agency. Khaya Defero has staged RSVP, AGW, The Big Chill, and Zimdaba, experiences designed to elevate the very idea of what Zimbabwean hospitality and show business could look like. When I began curating events in Harare, I realised there was no real separation between the celebrity and fan, no true culture of hospitality that elevated talent. Through these platforms, we changed that.\n\nShes also helped shepherd multi-award-winning talents like Shingai and ShaSha, bridging the tricky gap between diaspora fame and local relevance. Many artists who succeed abroad struggle to reconnect at home. The balance is always authenticity, keeping Zimbabwean creativity intact, while packaging it in ways that resonate globally and locally.\n\nThat same dual vision threads through her leadership roles as President of the Zimbabwe Association of Accredited Practitioners in Advertising (ZAAPA) and CEO of the Zimbabwe Music Awards (ZIMA). For her, the two industries arent as far apart as people assume. Advertising and music are two sides of the same coin. In advertising, we shape narratives that move markets. In music, we shape narratives that move people.\n\nIf that sounds like the voice of a seasoned operator, its because Zvirawa has been navigating and leading in male-dominated spaces for decades. When you show up prepared, deliver, and stay true to your values, respect eventually follows, even if it takes longer than it should.\n\nWhat makes her tick is the idea of rebranding Zimbabwe through creativity. Zimbabwes greatest resource is its people and their creativity. Im in the business of exporting that, our music, our ideas, our artistry. Its a project both ambitious and pragmatic to put Zimbabwean work in front of global audiences, and watch assumptions shift.\n\nIn her next chapter, Zvirawa is betting on technology as a force for transformation. She has invested in Black Mobile, a Pan-African mobile value-added services company with a footprint in Zimbabwe, South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Botswana, and Zambia.\n\nFor me, this is about future-proofing Africas creative economy. Our artists, brands, and storytellers need platforms that are homegrown, designed with our realities at the core, yet powerful enough to scale globally. Black Mobile represents that opportunity.\n\n",

It must have been very clear to you I was intensely unwell.\n\nShe added: I felt ashamed, unclean and embarrassed.\n\nBut with my improved strength and sense of self worth a feeling of clarity arrived  it was not my fault or responsibility, it was wholly yours.\n\nJudge Richard Kelly told Ncube he had shown a warped sense of responsibility by suggesting the victim initiated the conduct.\n\nNcube, previously of good character, was sentenced to four years and nine months imprisonment.\n\nHe expressed remorse through his barrister, who said he felt nothing but shame and guilt for his actions.\n\n",
