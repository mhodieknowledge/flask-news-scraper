In a fact-checking story, State-owned The Herald newspaper attributes this information to senior officials, including Dr Bernard Madzima, CEO of the National AIDS Council (NAC), who states the country has sufficient condom stocks.\n\nHowever, a separate report from the international news agency AFP presented a different perspective, highlighting the struggles of sex workers.AFP quoted a 43-year-old sex worker, Sharon Mukakanhanga, who says she resorted to using baby socks as a condom when she became desperate after the withdrawal of U.S. foreign health aid.Another sex worker, Cecilia Ruzvidzo, was quoted by AFP as saying, I could not get condoms, which are a necessity for my work.The Herald newspaper stated that the claims of using baby socks are greatly exaggerated and misleadingThe Herald stated that the claims of using baby socks are greatly exaggerated and misleading and were sensationalized by anti-government organizations. The newspaper also quoted health experts who warn that using such unsafe accessories is dangerous and ineffective in preventing HIV.According to The Herald, the NAC has confirmed that while there were isolated reports of stockouts and hoarding earlier in the year, the situation is now under control. The council told the Harare-based publication that female condoms are also available in abundance and that their supply exceeds demand.The Herald also confirmed that Zimbabwe has the capacity to test condoms for quality control, with the Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe (MCAZ) possessing specialized equipment to ensure they meet international standards.In 2022, IOL reported that the price of condoms in Zimbabwe was so high, with a three-pack costing about the same price as the minimum wage domestic workers take home.According to local media at the time, sex workers in the country were allegedly having to resort to using bread packets as contraception, as the price of condoms and basic essentials continues to rise.\n\nHowever, a separate report from the international news agency AFP presented a different perspective, highlighting the struggles of sex workers.\n\nAFP quoted a 43-year-old sex worker, Sharon Mukakanhanga, who says she resorted to using baby socks as a condom when she became desperate after the withdrawal of U.S. foreign health aid.Another sex worker, Cecilia Ruzvidzo, was quoted by AFP as saying, I could not get condoms, which are a necessity for my work.The Herald newspaper stated that the claims of using baby socks are greatly exaggerated and misleadingThe Herald stated that the claims of using baby socks are greatly exaggerated and misleading and were sensationalized by anti-government organizations.

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nAS Zimbabwe commemorates the International Day of Peace today, September 21, a human rights watchdog, the Zimbabwe Peace Project (ZPP), has called upon political parties across the spectrum to prioritise policies that safeguard human rights and deliver essential services.\n\nIn a statement this Saturday, ZPP said when citizens notice equitable distribution of resources, functioning social services, and policies that uphold dignity, they are more inclined to build peace among themselves and extend it to others.The call comes as the the country continues to grapple with threats to peace in the form of persistent human rights violations.ZPP said peace will flourish when citizens are empowered, livelihoods secured, and communities benefit tangibly from national resources, where this would nurture social cohesion, an ideal which is already envisioned in National Development Strategies (NDS).In a country where the populace is losing social benefits such as pensions, citizens have felt neglected, fuelling tensions in almost all sectors.ZPP warned that failure to have protection of socio-economic rights will result in political promises ringing hollow, triggering frustration and disillusionment.The peace threats were said to be more prominent during politically sensitive periods, where violence, intimidation, and exclusionary tactics expose the fragility of peace at a time when collective tolerance is most needed.Upholding non-violence, fairness, and transparency in all the enjoyment of socio-economic rights is central to peace.A hungry, unemployed, and excluded population cannot be expected to prioritise peace when survival itself is at stake, ZPP said.According to the ZPP, peace is not built on slogans but on peoples lived experiences.On this International Day of Peace, ZPP urges every Zimbabwean, leaders, institutions, civil society, and communities, to recommit to peace, not only in words but in action. Together, we can reimagine and realise a Zimbabwe where peace is not fragile but firm, not conditional but guaranteed, and not postponed but lived every day.This year alone, ZPP has documented 891 human rights violations, and these have affected over 38,400 people across provinces (38,417 people affected, 20,627 women, 17,790 men with 553 PWDs), added ZPP.ZPP called for concrete and collective action to the civil society and Community-Based Organisations to deepen grassroots peace-building, document violations, and hold duty-bearers accountable while fostering inclusive dialogue across divides.Political parties must put the nation above partisan interests; uphold non-violence, fairness, and transparency in all political processes to state institutions.Independent commissions should strengthen accountability mechanisms, protect rights without fear or favour, and build trust with citizens.To the international community, ZPP urged support to Zimbabwes peace-building initiatives with technical, diplomatic, and financial assistance, ensuring that human rights and socio-economic justice remain central to development partnerships.Peace is not an abstract dream; it is the practical outcome of justice, fairness, and accountability. It thrives when leaders are sincere, when institutions serve impartially, and when communities are empowered to prosper.\n\nIn a statement this Saturday, ZPP said when citizens notice equitable distribution of resources, functioning social services, and policies that uphold dignity, they are more inclined to build peace among themselves and extend it to others.\n\nThe call comes as the the country continues to grapple with threats to peace in the form of persistent human rights violations.ZPP said peace will flourish when citizens are empowered, livelihoods secured, and communities benefit tangibly from national resources, where this would nurture social cohesion, an ideal which is already envisioned in National Development Strategies (NDS).In a country where the populace is losing social benefits such as pensions, citizens have felt neglected, fuelling tensions in almost all sectors.ZPP warned that failure to have protection of socio-economic rights will result in political promises ringing hollow, triggering frustration and disillusionment.The peace threats were said to be more prominent during politically sensitive periods, where violence, intimidation, and exclusionary tactics expose the fragility of peace at a time when collective tolerance is most needed.Upholding non-violence, fairness, and transparency in all the enjoyment of socio-economic rights is central to peace.A hungry, unemployed, and excluded population cannot be expected to prioritise peace when survival itself is at stake, ZPP said.According to the ZPP, peace is not built on slogans but on peoples lived experiences.On this International Day of Peace, ZPP urges every Zimbabwean, leaders, institutions, civil society, and communities, to recommit to peace, not only in words but in action.

            "content": "By James Muonwa\n\nTHE gods watching over one new City of Mutare general labourer only identified as Mungaishe must have been angry on the fateful Tuesday morning of September 16, 2025.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a joyous first day at his new employ, turned out nightmarish for the youthful lad, who together with another unidentified rookie handyman, started a fire to burn a small heap of trash, but the fire blew out of control and destroyed over 50 cars parked at a nearby garage.\n\nA visibly shaken Mungaishe told a local radio station, Diamond FM, that he and his colleague were on a routine clean-up and never imagined the blaze would spiral out of control to cause the catastrophic event.\n\nWe were burning the rubbish on the other side of the road, Mungaishe explained, insisting it wasnt near the vehicles. But then, the wind picked it up.\n\nThe vicious flames jumped from the rubbish pile to the dry grass, and from the grass, it found its first victim: a single car parked inside Brooms Garage in the Riverside area. From there, the fire spread uncontrollably, engulfing vehicle after vehicle in a devastating chain reaction that reduced mostly Mercedes Benz vehicles, valued at several thousand dollars, to charred shells.\n\nThe devastating inferno at Brooms Garage has left owner, Anesu Akim, reeling from a massive loss.\n\nNow, in the aftermath of the huge conflagration, Akim and the vehicle owners are at pains to face the immense financial and emotional consequences of the loss.\n\nInvestigations by NewZimbabwe.com established that the garage was not insured to cover property at the premises, including customers vehicles.\n\nHowever, our probe could not immediately verify how many of the burnt cars had comprehensive insurance cover inorder to mitigate the financial loss to the owners.\n\nThe fire incident has ignited debate on social media, with most commentators laying the responsibility of compensation on the municipality, whose employees started the fire which caused damage to property.\n\nCity Town Clerk Blessing Chafesuka expressed sympathy towards victims of the fire, saying his council takes the matter seriously.\n\nAs a local authority, destruction of property and infrastructure by fire is an issue that cannot be watered down as it directly affects the livelihoods of our stakeholders.\n\nOur Fire Brigade was swift in minimising damage caused by the fire, Chafesuka said, adding an assessment of the magnitude of the damage was ongoing.\n\nThe town clerk assured affected individuals that the matter would be dealt with in terms of the law.\n\nI want to assure our valued stakeholders and all those affected that the matter will be dealt with in terms of the appropriate legal procedures, Chafesuka noted.\n\nLegal expert, Mlondolozi Ndlovu warned of an impending class action against the city council, which is liable for the alleged wrongful actions of its employees.\n\nThe council is liable for the actions of its employees if they were acting within the scope of their employment (contracts).\n\nSo, that means council could be responsible for the damages and may be sued by persons whose cars were damaged, either by the employees negligence or wrongful acts.\n\nThere must be direct causal links between the employees actions and the damages. Residents can demand compensation directly from council or seek redress from the civil courts, said Ndlovu.\n\nBrian Vengai, an insurance broker at a reputable firm, told NewZimbabwe.com that motorists, and indeed all property owners, must consider putting their property under comprehensive insurance cover to mitigate loss in the event of such devastating situations.\n\nThe Mutare fire incident is a wake up call to property owners to consider putting their valuable assets under comprehensive insurance cover, so that if they suffer any unforeseen losses, their property would be replaced by the insurer, opined Vengai.\n\nThe beauty of this kind of full cover is realised when such in incidences of fires or other occurrences result in loss of property, including vehicles. The Mutare scenario should be a wake up call for everyone to think of having comprehensive insurance cover.\n\nRisk expert Marlon Mugiya echoed Vengais sentiments, underscoring the merits of the type of insurance.\n\nComprehensive insurance provides financial protection against a wide range of risks, helping you avoid significant out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nKnowing that you have comprehensive coverage can give you peace of mind as your property is protected against various unforeseen events, Mugiya told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nComprehensive insurance, also known as fully comprehensive insurance, is a type of vehicle insurance that provides broad coverage for damages to your vehicle, as well as third-party liabilities. It covers a wide range of risks, including damage to your vehicle resulting from accidents, regardless of who is at fault.\n\nIt also covers for loss of ones vehicle due to theft or attempted theft, damage or total loss of your vehicle due to fire, whether caused by an accident, electrical faults, or other factors, including natural disasters such as floods and cyclones.\n\nComprehensive insurance cover also takes care of damage to ones vehicle resulting from intentional acts of vandalism. There is also coverage for damages or injuries caused to third parties, including other vehicles, property, and bodily harm.\n\nHowever, this type of insurance typically does not cover normal wear and tear, maintenance, depreciation. Also, some policies may have specific exclusions, such as driving under the influence of alcohol or using your vehicle for unauthorised purposes.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE 14th edition of the Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba ended on a high note Friday with key stakeholders seizing the Mines and Minerals Development Bill as a golden opportunity to end rampant injustices bedeviling the nation.\n\nDespite the Southern Africa nation being endowed with a cocktail of precious minerals, the majority of the populace generally feels that very little benefits from the extractive sector have been of benefit to them.While millions worth of minerals are siphoned from the country, villagers have endured environmental destruction, broken infrastructure and dust inhaling related diseases with no resources to solve the problems.The gazetting of the Mines and Minerals Bill in June this year presented a window of hope to millions of citizens, who have endured decades of being sidelined under the colonial eras Mines Act.But at the 2025 Environmental Social Governance Conference hosted by Silveira House and the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Organisation (ZELO) during the ZAMI, several participants implored the government to expeditiously address all the problems bedeviling the mining sector through the Bill.Silveira House programmes manager, Dr Alois Madhekeni said his organisation as a faith based entity believes in the promulgation of legislation, which places human dignity at the core.That principle is expected to determine the manner in which both corporations and the government conduct their operations. So, in this case as corporations rush into the mining sector, the question is how is the dignity of the human person and that of communities being protected?He emphasised that mining should not leave the communities worse off economically, socially, health-wise, technologically and culturally as he implored the adoption of a rights-based perspective to mining.If we see these values embedded in the Minerals Amendment Bill, then we will be happy. Our role now as Silveira House is to ensure that communities have access to the document, they analyse it and are geared to adequately provide input, added Madhekeni.ZELO emphasised on the need to put in place a strong legal infrastructure as the gateway to sustainable mining activities across the country.The Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC) implored the government and corporates to be guided by the Biblical guidance, which talks about Godly fairness in enjoying the earth and its gifted abundance.However, the Mines and Mining Development Deputy Minister, Polite Kambamura said gazetting of the MMB is a gesture by the government to engage citizens on the contentious matter.It is a show by the government on its commitment to transparency and inclusivity, leaving no one behind. The Bill was prepared to enhance Zimbabwe as a friendly investment destination, which is investor ready .To make sure that community challenges are dealt with once and for all we brought sustainability into the Bill, he said.Kambamura added that the legal instrument responds to the ever-changing global and local environment.

So, in this case as corporations rush into the mining sector, the question is how is the dignity of the human person and that of communities being protected?\n\nHe emphasised that mining should not leave the communities worse off economically, socially, health-wise, technologically and culturally as he implored the adoption of a rights-based perspective to mining.If we see these values embedded in the Minerals Amendment Bill, then we will be happy. Our role now as Silveira House is to ensure that communities have access to the document, they analyse it and are geared to adequately provide input, added Madhekeni.ZELO emphasised on the need to put in place a strong legal infrastructure as the gateway to sustainable mining activities across the country.The Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC) implored the government and corporates to be guided by the Biblical guidance, which talks about Godly fairness in enjoying the earth and its gifted abundance.However, the Mines and Mining Development Deputy Minister, Polite Kambamura said gazetting of the MMB is a gesture by the government to engage citizens on the contentious matter.It is a show by the government on its commitment to transparency and inclusivity, leaving no one behind.

The water has impurities when it is available. When it is left in containers, the water turns greenish and brownish, which reduces confidence among residents to drink it.\n\nObservations by a lot of residents are that the city water dries their skin, probably due to the treatment chemicals they are using, read the report.\n\nThe plight of Harare residents was further compounded by the local authoritys workers, who embarked on a strike, citing incapacitation and protesting the death of two fellow employees who died in Budiriro.\n\nConsequently, the council could not attend to burst pipes, leaving areas like Mufakose as a ticking health time bomb.\n\nThe report further stated that the state of the roads in Harare is dire, leaving residents to patch up the potholes themselves.\n\nThe majority of the roads in Harares high-density residential suburbs are in bad shape, with potholes everywhere. The situation is better in the low-density areas, where the residents sometimes use their personal resources to do road patching, and council workers put more energy into repairing and maintaining roads leading to the homes of the powerful elites in society.\n\nIn Mbare, residents are disgruntled by the poor state of their streets. Vehicles passing by leave a trail of dust filling their homes. This has forced many households to keep their windows and doors closed most of the time. If not closed, sofas and floors will be covered in dust. Due to the dust, residents now fear contracting diseases, the report read.\n\n",
