            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nELEVEN Chipinge schoolchildren are suing ethanol producing firm, Green Fuel, and its security guards for over US$100,000 after they were assaulted earlier this year on allegations of stealing sugarcane.\n\nThe three security guards are Makina Ngwenya, Benjamin Dube and Munorwei Gomondera.In a viral video on social media earlier this year, the children were filmed lying down on their bellies while one of the guards flogged them.Parents and guardians of the school children, who are aged between 13 and 17 years, through the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR), filed summons at Chipinge Magistrates Court Friday against the three security guards and their employer for unlawful assault and ill-treatment.According to the childrens lawyers, Peggy Tavagadza and Tatenda Sigauke, the minors sustained serious injuries from the beatings.The children sustained injuries from the assault and experienced swollen backsides and were not able to walk properly for some time.They experienced shock, pain and suffering both physical and psychological, emotional trauma and distress, contumelia and suffered public humiliation while their dignity and bodily integrity was violated.The assault was grievous and psychologically traumatising due to the students young ages and the viral effect of the videos, which circulated on online platforms, the lawyers said.Sigauke and Tavagadza also want the court to order Ngwenya, Dube, Gomondera and Green Fuel to pay a total of US$110 000, which entails payment of US$10 000 to each student, for damages for pain and suffering, shock, trauma, contumelia and violation of dignity.The human rights lawyers are also demanding that Green Fuel publicly apologizes to the learners, their families, and the Chisumbanje community, condemn the guards actions, and commit to preventing similar abuses in future.The legal team also wants Green Fuels apology published in a local Manicaland newspaper, aired daily on Vemuganga Community Radio for five days, and displayed on the companys social media and notice boards for 14 days.\n\nThe three security guards are Makina Ngwenya, Benjamin Dube and Munorwei

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nINHABITANTS of Mberengwa in Midlands province have implored Parliament to translate the Mines and Minerals Bill to local languages in order to empower communities to address problems bedeviling them through meaningful input when public hearings kick off.\n\nThe Bill, which has gone through several twists and turns since 2015, is seen as a signal marking the departure from the archaic colonial legislation last promulgated in 1961, leaving gaps which the mining companies have taken advantage of over the years.The document was gazetted in June 2025 under General Notice 1243A of 2025 by Clerk of Parliament, Kennedy Chokuda, in terms of Standing Order No.142 (1) of the National Assembly.Speaking during the Silveira House organised district environmental impact assessment dialogue this week, Mberengwa Ward 10 Councillor, Devilious Mashavakure called on Parliament to set out its systems for widespread circulation.Parliament must strive to overcome the language barriers in communities hardest hit by mining activities. The English jargon used in law is often confusing hence the urgent need to roll it out in local languages.So far we appreciate the role being played by community based publications in conscientising the Mberengwa local residents, he said.Mashavakure urged stakeholders and Parliament to work expeditiously and pave the way for the finalisation of the Bill as soon as possible as a strategy to stop the current rampant environmental damage before it goes offhand.Merengwa Ward 16 Councillor, Lovemore Nkomo expressed gratitude over the clauses in the Bill saying it has the potential to address the bulk of problems bedeviling the mining sector.He said the neo-colonial agenda contained in the 1961 Mines and Minerals Act could be a thing of the past once the Bill sails through. He underscored that the document needs to be circulated in local languages way on time ahead of public hearings.Alder Makotore, an Environmental Sub Committee member in the same district implored Parly to urgently insert issues that affect women in mining communities such as destruction of water sources, eradicating sexual harassment, which are not so prominent in Bill.She said mechanisms which guaranteed womens participation during the forthcoming public hearings exercises must be put in place.Silveira House project manager for community-led mining advocacy and governance, Zandile Mvududu said while the Bill presents opportunities to address legacy problems in the mining sector, the Portfolio Committee on Mines must be geared to receive overwhelming feedback from residents.With the Environmental Social Governance (ESG) focus in most mining communities which have been influenced by the efforts to minimise the ESG risks, we feel that the Bill has gained so much momentum in the communities, she said.\n\nThe Bill, which has gone through several twists and turns since 2015, is seen as a signal marking the departure from the archaic colonial legislation last promulgated in 1961, leaving gaps which the mining companies have taken advantage of over the years.\n\nThe document was gazetted in June 2025 under General Notice 1243A of 2025 by Clerk of Parliament, Kennedy Chokuda, in terms of Standing Order No.142 (1) of the National Assembly.Speaking during the Silveira House organised district environmental impact assessment dialogue this week, Mberengwa Ward 10 Councillor, Devilious Mashavakure called on Parliament to set out its systems for widespread circulation.Parliament must strive to overcome the language barriers in communities hardest hit by mining activities.

Muwodzeri said.The MPs call comes after this weeks mysterious murder of prominent businessman Joseph Mutangaz Mutangadura (67) who was gunned down at his Lisheen Estate in Ruwa late last Sunday.Joseph Mutangaz MutangaduraActing leader of government business in Parliament Anxious Masuka said guns have to be registered.Guns have to be licenced. I know the ministry has requested that more punitive measures be meted on those found to be in possession of illegal firearms, and not just in possession, but it is also worrisome to hear that those firearms are used to commit robberies and some of those culminating in murders, Masuka said.However, Masuka highlighted to Speaker Jacob Mudenda that because of the gravity of the matter, licenced or unlicenced guns can be used for robberies and to commit murder, hence a research on the veracity of the issue should be done.Referring to the question by Muwodzeri, the minister responded: This is a very worrisome development. If it is unlicenced, it is illegal.The law must take its course and the full wrath of the law must visit those that use unlicenced firearms and carry unlicenced firearms.To own the citizenry, we must follow the proper channels of acquiring firearms and be able to adhere to the conditions that are associated with the issuance of such firearms, said MasukaZanu PF MP for Mberengwa West, Tafanana Zhou asked what could be done to ensure that the firearms licences were not easily acquired by foreigners, who get licences easily, abusing those firearms?Masuka promised to inquire from the Home Affairs ministry so that they analyse the laws and see how they can be strengthened to ensure proper vetting may be done for anyone who needs a firearms licence.Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) Kuwadzana East MP Charlton Hwende alleged that most of the people using unlicenced firearms were in the army and the police.What is government policy to ensure that government pays soldiers and the police enough salaries so that they do not abuse firearms and abuse them for robbery?The Speaker ordered Hwende to bring up the matter in a written form as statistics were needed to indicate how many of the security forces were found in possession of firearms after robbery or shootings.Opposition legislator Edwin Mushoriwa for Dzivaresekwa constituency requested to know if government had plans to amend the Firearms Act [Chapter 10: 09] which was enacted a very long time ago.Is there any attempt to amend that Act, given that most of the guns, some of them are inherited guns that have not been properly changed, Mushoriwa said.Dangamvura-Chikanga MP Prosper Mutseyami chipped in querying if there were measures being taken by the government to ensure that firearms do not cross into Zimbabwe illegally.The policy is to ensure that borders are well secured.

It will be decentralised in all our central hospitals, as you are aware that all our central hospitals have specialists who can perform these surgeries.\n\nWhat is now hindering them is the modern equipment to use for that, but definitely with time, we are going to make sure that it is going to be done to our locals and to our people for free, said Kwidi.\n\nThe lack of medical equipment in major public hospitals has left many citizens to seek treatment outside the country.\n\nHowever, the poor who cannot afford specialised treatment in foreign countries and private medical facilities have to contend with the dire services in public hospitals.\n\nKwidini made a bold assertion that the government is addressing the countrys healthcare systems.\n\nWith that, as per our policy, we want to make sure that these trained specialist doctors locally are going to be capacitated, especially with the tools of trade.\n\nThat is why we have seen now that our President has moved to the mantra to say, let us renovate our health institutions into the modern systems to ensure that we are able to do the specialised treatment which people are seeking on these major operations, especially in India and other countries, said Kwidini.\n\n",

Therefore, we are looking forward to having more doctors in 2029 to 2030 to service these rural hospitals, said Kwidini.\n\nThis has left citizens in rural areas in a quandary, forcing them to walk long distances to access medical services.\n\nKwidini said this is a result of a lack of accommodation facilities at some rural clinics.\n\nIt is true that we need doctors in rural hospitals so that elderly people do not have to travel long distances to see doctors. We have a challenge with the doctors houses in district hospitals. This is the challenge that we are facing, which then results in elderly people failing to find those doctors in rural hospitals.\n\nThere is no accommodation for these doctors, but as soon as we put in place accommodation, they will be found nearer to them. For us to put doctors in clinics, it is difficult because the patient ratio is not enough, he said.\n\nThe countrys health system is in dire straits, leaving the majority to rely on private facilities, with the poor left to contend with the public hospitals.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has pledged to address the situation at public hospitals, with a section of Parirenyatwa Hospital undergoing renovations.\n\n",
