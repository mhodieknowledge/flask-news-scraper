            "content": "By James Muonwa\n\nTHE gods watching over one new City of Mutare general labourer only identified as Mungaishe must have been angry on the fateful Tuesday morning of September 16, 2025.\n\nWhat was supposed to be a joyous first day at his new employ, turned out nightmarish for the youthful lad, who together with another unidentified rookie handyman, started a fire to burn a small heap of trash, but the fire blew out of control and destroyed over 50 cars parked at a nearby garage.\n\nA visibly shaken Mungaishe told a local radio station, Diamond FM, that he and his colleague were on a routine clean-up and never imagined the blaze would spiral out of control to cause the catastrophic event.\n\nWe were burning the rubbish on the other side of the road, Mungaishe explained, insisting it wasnt near the vehicles. But then, the wind picked it up.\n\nThe vicious flames jumped from the rubbish pile to the dry grass, and from the grass, it found its first victim: a single car parked inside Brooms Garage in the Riverside area. From there, the fire spread uncontrollably, engulfing vehicle after vehicle in a devastating chain reaction that reduced mostly Mercedes Benz vehicles, valued at several thousand dollars, to charred shells.\n\nThe devastating inferno at Brooms Garage has left owner, Anesu Akim, reeling from a massive loss.\n\nNow, in the aftermath of the huge conflagration, Akim and the vehicle owners are at pains to face the immense financial and emotional consequences of the loss.\n\nInvestigations by NewZimbabwe.com established that the garage was not insured to cover property at the premises, including customers vehicles.\n\nHowever, our probe could not immediately verify how many of the burnt cars had comprehensive insurance cover inorder to mitigate the financial loss to the owners.\n\nThe fire incident has ignited debate on social media, with most commentators laying the responsibility of compensation on the municipality, whose employees started the fire which caused damage to property.\n\nCity Town Clerk Blessing Chafesuka expressed sympathy towards victims of the fire, saying his council takes the matter seriously.\n\nAs a local authority, destruction of property and infrastructure by fire is an issue that cannot be watered down as it directly affects the livelihoods of our stakeholders.\n\nOur Fire Brigade was swift in minimising damage caused by the fire, Chafesuka said, adding an assessment of the magnitude of the damage was ongoing.\n\nThe town clerk assured affected individuals that the matter would be dealt with in terms of the law.\n\nI want to assure our valued stakeholders and all those affected that the matter will be dealt with in terms of the appropriate legal procedures, Chafesuka noted.\n\nLegal expert, Mlondolozi Ndlovu warned of an impending class action against the city council, which is liable for the alleged wrongful actions of its employees.\n\nThe council is liable for the actions of its employees if they were acting within the scope of their employment (contracts).\n\nSo, that means council could be responsible for the damages and may be sued by persons whose cars were damaged, either by the employees negligence or wrongful acts.\n\nThere must be direct causal links between the employees actions and the damages. Residents can demand compensation directly from council or seek redress from the civil courts, said Ndlovu.\n\nBrian Vengai, an insurance broker at a reputable firm, told NewZimbabwe.com that motorists, and indeed all property owners, must consider putting their property under comprehensive insurance cover to mitigate loss in the event of such devastating situations.\n\nThe Mutare fire incident is a wake up call to property owners to consider putting their valuable assets under comprehensive insurance cover, so that if they suffer any unforeseen losses, their property would be replaced by the insurer, opined Vengai.\n\nThe beauty of this kind of full cover is realised when such in incidences of fires or other occurrences result in loss of property, including vehicles. The Mutare scenario should be a wake up call for everyone to think of having comprehensive insurance cover.\n\nRisk expert Marlon Mugiya echoed Vengais sentiments, underscoring the merits of the type of insurance.\n\nComprehensive insurance provides financial protection against a wide range of risks, helping you avoid significant out-of-pocket expenses.\n\nKnowing that you have comprehensive coverage can give you peace of mind as your property is protected against various unforeseen events, Mugiya told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nComprehensive insurance, also known as fully comprehensive insurance, is a type of vehicle insurance that provides broad coverage for damages to your vehicle, as well as third-party liabilities. It covers a wide range of risks, including damage to your vehicle resulting from accidents, regardless of who is at fault.\n\nIt also covers for loss of ones vehicle due to theft or attempted theft, damage or total loss of your vehicle due to fire, whether caused by an accident, electrical faults, or other factors, including natural disasters such as floods and cyclones.\n\nComprehensive insurance cover also takes care of damage to ones vehicle resulting from intentional acts of vandalism. There is also coverage for damages or injuries caused to third parties, including other vehicles, property, and bodily harm.\n\nHowever, this type of insurance typically does not cover normal wear and tear, maintenance, depreciation.

The remaining 15 months were converted to 825 hours of community service.\n\nMakamba and Mukwamba were each sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, with three months suspended, and the balance converted to 315 hours of community service each.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE 14th edition of the Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba ended on a high note Friday with key stakeholders seizing the Mines and Minerals Development Bill as a golden opportunity to end rampant injustices bedeviling the nation.\n\nDespite the Southern Africa nation being endowed with a cocktail of precious minerals, the majority of the populace generally feels that very little benefits from the extractive sector have been of benefit to them.While millions worth of minerals are siphoned from the country, villagers have endured environmental destruction, broken infrastructure and dust inhaling related diseases with no resources to solve the problems.The gazetting of the Mines and Minerals Bill in June this year presented a window of hope to millions of citizens, who have endured decades of being sidelined under the colonial eras Mines Act.But at the 2025 Environmental Social Governance Conference hosted by Silveira House and the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Organisation (ZELO) during the ZAMI, several participants implored the government to expeditiously address all the problems bedeviling the mining sector through the Bill.Silveira House programmes manager, Dr Alois Madhekeni said his organisation as a faith based entity believes in the promulgation of legislation, which places human dignity at the core.That principle is expected to determine the manner in which both corporations and the government conduct their operations. So, in this case as corporations rush into the mining sector, the question is how is the dignity of the human person and that of communities being protected?He emphasised that mining should not leave the communities worse off economically, socially, health-wise, technologically and culturally as he implored the adoption of a rights-based perspective to mining.If we see these values embedded in the Minerals Amendment Bill, then we will be happy. Our role now as Silveira House is to ensure that communities have access to the document, they analyse it and are geared to adequately provide input, added Madhekeni.ZELO emphasised on the need to put in place a strong legal infrastructure as the gateway to sustainable mining activities across the country.The Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC) implored the government and corporates to be guided by the Biblical guidance, which talks about Godly fairness in enjoying the earth and its gifted abundance.However, the Mines and Mining Development Deputy Minister, Polite Kambamura said gazetting of the MMB is a gesture by the government to engage citizens on the contentious matter.It is a show by the government on its commitment to transparency and inclusivity, leaving no one behind. The Bill was prepared to enhance Zimbabwe as a friendly investment destination, which is investor ready .To make sure that community challenges are dealt with once and for all we brought sustainability into the Bill, he said.Kambamura added that the legal instrument responds to the ever-changing global and local environment. It will open up room for the drafting of the mining policy and cover all the issues which speak to mining.\n\nDespite the Southern Africa nation being endowed with a cocktail of precious minerals, the majority of the populace generally feels that very little benefits from the extractive sector have been of benefit to them.\n\nWhile millions worth of minerals are siphoned from the country, villagers have endured environmental destruction, broken infrastructure and dust inhaling related diseases with no resources to solve the problems.The gazetting of the Mines and Minerals Bill in June this year presented a window of hope to millions of citizens, who have endured decades of being sidelined under the colonial eras Mines Act.But at the 2025 Environmental Social Governance Conference hosted by Silveira House and the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Organisation (ZELO) during the ZAMI, several participants implored the government to expeditiously address all the problems bedeviling the mining sector through the Bill.Silveira House programmes manager, Dr Alois Madhekeni said his organisation as a faith based entity believes in the promulgation of legislation, which places human dignity at the core.That principle is expected to determine the manner in which both corporations and the government conduct their operations.
