            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFormer Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) leader Nelson Chamisa on Thursday announced plans to launch a new political movement in a fresh bid to dislodge Zanu PF from power.\n\nChamisa resigned from the CCC in January 2024 citing that his party had been hijacked by Zanu PF leader and President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nThis followed a period of turmoil after self-appointed CCC Secretary-General Sengezo Tshabangu went on a rampage, recalling councillors and members of Parliament, particularly those backing Chamisa and critical of Zanu PF.\n\nTshabangu further barred recalled CCC members from participating in by-elections under the CCC banner, leaving many MPs and councillors out in the cold.\n\nHaving kept a low profile for some time, Chamisa has now begun signalling a return to full-time politics, dispelling the notion that he was done with the political arena.\n\nI want you to know; I am not idle. I am consulting. I am building. I am assembling a new strategy and a citizens team that will carry and pivot this nation unto greatness and stardom, Chamisa wrote on his X account, Thursday.\n\nHe described his departure from the CCC as disembarking from a ship that was leaking and could have jeopardised the democratic project he is striving to realise in Zimbabwe.\n\nI left CCC but not the mission. All because CCC was never the destination. It was just the vehicle meant to take us to the New Zimbabwe. When that vehicle was compromised, it became necessary to step out and prepare a better, cleaner, fit-for-purpose vehicle, he explained.\n\nChamisa further acknowledged the mistakes he made during his time at the helm of the CCC.\n\nOur approach in 2023 was not the same as 2018, because in the fight against oppression, no strategy is cast in stone. This is a battle to save lives and to save a nation. We sometimes miss. We sometimes omit. We commit. We adjust. We correct. We keep moving forward until we win. And win we must.\n\nNone of this would have been possible without you.\n\n",

She therefore has no capacity to interfere with members of the ZRP investigating this case.\n\nThe accused is a fit candidate for bail. She is a mother of two and the solebreadwinner of her family.\n\nIn addition to her children, she also takes care of a niece who is totally dependent on her and also her mother, aged 70.\n\nMhike said Zaba is of fixed abode, adding that she is employed as an editor.\n\nShe needs to go back to work soon after she recuperates from her current ill health.\n\nThe accused before you is an award-winning journalist well respected in Zimbabwe Media, commercial, human rights and philanthropic circles, he said.\n\nCourt was also told of her other colourful accolades in media circles, including being the Secretary General of the Zimbabwe National Editors Forum (ZINEF), a mentor, and a member of the Women in News organisation, as such a responsible person to be trusted with freedom.\n\nThis shows she is a distinguished member of the society, Mhike said.\n\nThe lawyer also said Zaba did not give the police trouble when she was arrested.\n\nShe made every effort to honour the request by the police for her to attend at the police station.\n\nShe voluntarily walked into Harare Central Police Station in the company of her lawyer.\n\nIt is regrettable that the police did not allow her to go home after the recording of her warned and cautioned statement, he said.\n\nCitizens who honour and respect authorities ought to be spared from harsh prison realities. As indicated, the accused is not feeling well and the veracity of that submission is documented.\n\nHowever, Mhike raised a complaint against the police, saying, Our complaint is that the accused was detained overnight even in the face of comprehensive medical documentation confirming that she was on bed rest on the order of a medical doctor.\n\nJambawu said police officers and some of Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) employees are lined up to testify against Zaba.\n\nZaba is represented by Mhike andNontokozo Dube Tachiona.\n\n",

            "content": "The success of digital betting platforms increasingly depends on the quality of payment solutions. In Africa, fast and reliable transactions are not just an option  they are essential. Payment providers now play a central role in how users deposit, withdraw, and manage funds on betting sites.\n\nIn markets like Liberia, mobile wallets and local payment apps make up most transactions. Platforms like the1xbet.com.lr.work with providers that allow instant transfers and reduce dependency on traditional banks. This makes betting more accessible, especially in rural areas where bank coverage remains limited.\n\nHow Payment Integration Shapes the User Experience\n\nDigital users expect smooth onboarding. A delay in depositing funds can push users away. Fast approval, low fees, and multiple payment formats create a trusted environment. In Liberia, mobile-first habits influence every aspect of digital interaction, including gaming and financial platforms.\n\nPlatforms integrate local mobile money services, bank APIs, and QR-based payments. This meets user needs for flexibility and control. Betting apps that support these services gain more traction and better user ratings. One example is thehttp://1xbet.com.lr/en/mobile, which combines fast financial access with clear interfaces and fast response times.\n\nPayment solutions also influence retention. Players are more likely to return if they can access winnings quickly and safely. Delays or failed withdrawals hurt trust and slow down platform growth. Well-integrated providers reduce these risks by ensuring seamless communication between systems.\n\nLive Features and Analytics in Real-Time Systems\n\nAs live betting grows, real-time transaction capability becomes a top feature. Users want to place a bet, receive confirmation, and monitor the odds without lag. This requires payment systems that update instantly and handle high volumes.\n\nIn Liberia, internet speed may vary, so efficient systems matter more. Betting platforms must adjust for regional connection limits. At the same time, they need to deliver smooth live markets. Users engaged inlive betting on 1xBet liberiaexpect fluid betting without financial or technical blocks.\n\nPayment data is also valuable. Platforms usedata analyticsto track trends, monitor risk, and personalise offers. Fast systems provide accurate snapshots of user spending. This allows companies to improve service, manage limits, and flag unusual activity before it becomes a problem.\n\nFeatures That Make Payment Providers Competitive\n\nTo serve betting platforms well, providers need more than fast processing. They must be safe, affordable, and compatible with mobile use. The following features are essential:\n\nThese features improve platform reputation. Users rate apps based not just on games or odds but also on how easy it is to manage money. Payment issues are a top reason users delete betting apps. Efficient providers directly improve user satisfaction.\n\nThe Future of Betting Will Be Payment-Driven\n\nDigital entertainment depends more than ever on financial tools.Betting platformsthat want to grow must offer advanced payment integration from the start. In Africa, where mobile usage outpaces traditional banking, this matters even more.\n\nIn Liberia, the next step may be partnerships between providers and telecom networks. These deals can unlock free data, discounted fees, or exclusive offers. For users, this means greater value and faster service. For platforms, it means more loyal customers.\n\nWith trusted payment services, digital betting can grow responsibly. Providers will remain key to making this market secure, accessible, and scalable for every new user.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/how-to-avoid-common-traps-in-basketball-betting/",
            "content": "Basketball betting is fast-paced and full of opportunities. It also brings risks, especially for those who follow teams without checking the numbers. Many new bettors focus only on form or recent wins, missing the deeper data that shapes match outcomes.\n\nPlatforms used across West Africa are improving, making more data and tools available to players. The1xbet.gm.offers features that help users avoid basic mistakes, such as incomplete stats or delayed updates. However, even with the best tools, players must understand where they can go wrong.\n\nUnderstanding the Most Frequent Errors\n\nStatistics and movement drive basketball markets. Many players forget this and base their bets on recent headlines or team reputation. Others rush bets without reviewing lineups or injury reports. This creates losses that could be avoided with basic preparation.\n\nAnother mistake is ignoring game context. Back-to-back matches, travel schedules, and motivation levels all affect performance. If you skip this step, you are betting in the dark. Using reliable sources and updated platforms reduces that risk.\n\nSome users turn to mobile tools for quick access. With thehttp://www.1xbet.gm/en/mobile, bettors track odds, match updates, and team status in one space. This makes it easier to react before odds change.\n\nKey Areas That Often Mislead Bettors\n\nTo reduce poor outcomes, players must spot the typical traps. Below are key reasons why many basketball bets fail:\n\nIn Gambia, many betting fans join group chats or online forums. These help discuss picks and point out match-day alerts. However, it is also easy to be misled by hype or rumours. Balance is key.\n\nTools and Bonuses That Support Better Picks\n\nModern apps and platforms now offer advanced support. Players can check injury reports, betting trends, and odds comparisons. These tools help filter emotions from real value.\n\nBettors who rely on verified features get better results. For example, users can explore new offers throughsports betting on 1xbet gambia, where live games and data updates run smoothly. This system helps avoid stale information.\n\nMany users also join with promo offers. One common method is to use a promo code for extra rewards, which adds bonus funds or reduced limits. These offers are useful if used carefully, especially during tournaments.\n\nRules and Requirements Often Overlooked\n\nSome bettors face losses not from the match, but from misunderstanding platform rules. Cash-out restrictions, time-limited bonuses, and game-type exclusions often surprise users. Always checkwagering requirementsbefore using bonuses or placing combo bets.\n\nUnderstanding rules is just as important as picking the right team. You might win a bet but lose the reward if the conditions are not met. Most platforms explain this clearly, but many players skip the small print.\n\nSerious bettors use notebooks, spreadsheets, or app tools to track their habits. This helps identify weak spots and reduce repeated mistakes.\n\nLearning from Data and Planning Ahead\n\nGood bettingis based on observation. Top bettors do not just follow trends. They study how teams perform under pressure, which players close out games, and how coaches rotate their squads.\n\nIn basketball, second-half scores often differ from first-half stats. Smart users adjust at half-time or shift their focus to live markets. Data tools can guide that process and suggest alternate bets.\n\nKeeping a long-term view also protects players from emotional bets. After a loss, the goal is not to recover instantly but to reset with better decisions.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Smarter Basketball Bets\n\nAvoiding common traps begins with discipline. Successful basketball betting does not depend only on luck. It comes from research, updated tools, and reading each game correctly.\n\nReliable apps support fast access and clear navigation. This saves time and helps make quicker decisions. Matching those tools with basic strategy improves results.\n\nFrom injury reports to betting limits, the smallest details can decide the outcome. Learning to manage them builds confidence, consistency, and better outcomes over time. In Gambia and beyond, basketball bettors who plan well enjoy the game more and win more often.\n\n",

            "content": "How Sports Calendars Influence Betting Traffic\n\nBetting activity across digital platforms rises and falls with the sports calendar. Major events like championships, finals, and international tournaments generate sharp increases in betting volume. Off-season months usually show lower engagement, especially when fewer games are broadcast live.\n\nIn Ethiopia, this pattern is clear across mobile and desktop users. Platforms backed by digital operators like thehttp://www.1xbet.et/enoften see traffic peaks tied directly to the sports schedule. Understanding these trends helps users and platform managers plan effectively.\n\nSeasonal Traffic Spikes in Digital Betting\n\nThe busiest times for betting platforms usually match the biggest events on the sports calendar. These include football tournaments, tennis majors, Formula 1 weekends, and basketball playoffs. During these periods, user activity multiplies. Bettors place more wagers, watch more games, and engage with bonus offers more frequently.\n\nThis pattern repeats yearly. For example, when national leagues like Serie A or the Premier League resume, mobile traffic increases immediately. Bettors check form tables, injury news, and live match data. Matches involving top clubs or intense rivalries often double or triple usual bet counts.\n\nDuring these periods, users are also more likely to search for1xbet downloadand install apps that allow fast access and live tracking. This helps them follow odds, place in-play bets, and track results in real time.\n\nQuiet Periods and Regional Differences\n\nNot all months bring equal traffic. Off-season periods, especially in sports with fixed seasons, cause a clear drop in betting volume. Many users reduce their activity or shift attention to virtual games, slot tournaments, or casino sections. Betting platforms must adapt by offering seasonal bonuses or alternate gaming options.\n\nRegional differences also matter. In Ethiopia, public interest rises more around football and athletics. Less attention is paid to sports like baseball or ice hockey, which remain niche. Platforms adjust accordingly, highlighting popular events and shifting promotional focus.\n\nSome users prefer alternate content during these slower months. Pages such ashttp://www.1xbet.et/en/casinooffer options beyond seasonal betting. Games, quick rounds, and live dealers keep traffic flowing even without major sports on the calendar.\n\nLegal Restrictions and Event Timing\n\nSome traffic shifts occur due to temporary rules or media blackouts. If an event is delayed or moved, betting activity often drops sharply. Regulatory pauses, such as temporary bans or restricted bet types, also affect platform traffic.\n\nEven the suggestion of havingbetting bannedfor a short period can lead to user drop-off. This effect is short-lived if the platform offers alternative content and clear updates. Communication helps retain users until regular service returns.\n\nTime zones also affect traffic. When matches are broadcast late at night, fewer casual users place live bets. Platform managers track data to see which time slots work best for engagement.\n\nHow Platforms Manage Fluctuations\n\nTo respond to seasonal highs and lows, betting platforms adjust their operations. They increase ad campaigns before big tournaments and cut back during quiet periods. They may also offer time-limited deals or mobile-only promos during the off-season.\n\nHere is how platforms keep traffic consistent:\n\nPlatforms also track trends to decide when to promote new features. Updates, bug fixes, and content expansions are often timed to land before big sports days, not during them.\n\nWhat Users Can Learn from Traffic Trends\n\nUsers benefit by following the same patterns. Betting during major events means better odds, more promotions, and greater access to data. Off-season periods offer slower pace and sometimes more generous loyalty rewards.\n\nTracking sports calendars helps users manage expectations and balance their betting activity. High-traffic times are ideal for testing new bet types or competing in leaderboards. Quiet months offer chances to explore casino games, try new features, or reset strategies.\n\nPlatforms that support both seasonal and non-seasonal content retain more users over time. Users who follow the calendar and adjust their habits stay more informed and more consistent in their approach. In regions like Ethiopia, this balance is key to building long-term interest indigital sports engagement.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Centre for Natural Resource Governance (CNRG) is pleading with the government to urgently rein in the operations of a Magunje-based Chinese miner over a web of human rightsviolations.\n\nThe CSO alleged that China-based West International Holdings, in partnership with Labenmon Investments, following documented human rights abuses, forced displacements, and environmental destruction linked to the Magunje cement and mining projects, has presided over gross human rights abuses.\n\nCNRG said the two companies are jointly investing US$1 billion to construct a cement plant in Magunje, Mashonaland West, with a production capacity of 900,000 tons of cement per year, and 1.8 million tons of clinker, supported by a 100MW captive power plant. The investment is also expected to generate 5,000 jobs.\n\nHowever, the promise of economic opportunity is being undermined by allegations of land grabs, community exclusion, and rights violations in the host area.\n\nFollowing growing distress calls from the community, CNRG visited the area and documented overwhelming evidence of land dispossession, intimidation, pollution, and labour exploitation in the name of clean energy and development, said CNRG.\n\nPart of the findings wasthat families were uprooted from their ancestral land without compensation after the companies took advantage of fraudulent consultation exercises.\n\nThe organisation reported that eight villagers from Kapere, including the Headman, were arrested for protecting their land and have been repeatedly appearing in Karoi Magistrate Court, despite the absence of the complainants.\n\nCNRG staff were also threatened by armed Zimbabwe National Army personnel at a mining site in Kemapondo village.\n\nMagunje Dam, a vital source of water for thousands of residents, is allegedly being polluted by effluent discharge from the cement plant, leading to the destruction of farmlands and gardens following fires ignited by the company during a land-clearing exercise.\n\nThe mining rights-based organisation said workers employed by the companies are operating under unsafe conditions, political discrimination, lack of contracts and low wages that are pegged below the National Employment Council (NEC) agreed rates.\n\nWe demand that the Ministry of Mines and Mining Development: Halts illegal operations and ensure accountability, protect community rights and interests, stop all threats against communities and ensure inclusive decision making, CNRG added.\n\n",
