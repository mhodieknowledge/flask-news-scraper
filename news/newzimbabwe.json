            "content": "By James Muonwa l Mashonaland West Correspondent\n\nAMID a worsening electricity deficit that has resulted in average households experiencing 18-hour blackouts, the need for alternative energy sources cannot be overemphasized.\n\nAfter realising the efficacy of accelerating the deployment of solar plants to the countrys energy mix, stakeholders in the insurance and pensions industry have invested in a solar power project located in Mashonaland West province, which has confirmed its status as not only the breadbasket of Zimbabwe, but the energy basket as well.\n\nAlready, the province is home to the countrys foremost hydroelectricity generation plant at Kariba.\n\nNow, through significant investment by the National Social Security Authority (NSSA) and Old Mutual Limited life has been breathed into a new solar power plant called Centragrid Nyabira Solar PV Park.\n\nThe independent power producer is licensed to own, finance, construct, and operate a 25MW solar power plant and its associated transmission facilities at Nyabira.\n\nNSSA and pan-African financial services group Old Mutual put a combined investment of $30 million in the solar power project.\n\nIt is, therefore, a refreshing reality that the pensions and insurance industry is contributing significantly towards the countrys socio-economic growth with players embarking on the transformative infrastructural development sitting on 50 hectares of land.\n\nMinister of State for Provincial Affairs and Devolution for Mashonaland West, Marian Chombo hailed the milestone infrastructural development that consolidates the provinces tag as a power house.\n\nMashonaland West is a power-producing province, and we have set the conditions for investors to come and invest in the energy sector. We need to produce more power to meet our energy needs, said Chombo.\n\nThere is still scope for more projects to ensure Zimbabwe has adequate energy for domestic consumption and surplus for export. We are particularly impressed by the solar power plant in our province.\n\nThe expansion of the solar farm and its associated transmission facilities followed an impact investment strategy of Old Mutual Limited and NSSA that was announced in December 2021.\n\nThe power plant is located at the 35km mark along the Harare-Chirundu highway, and it is now feeding into the grid, thanks to local pension fund, NSSA, as well as the investment arms of Old Mutual for helping make the project a reality. It is now the second largest utility-scale plant in Zimbabwe.\n\nCentragrid plant manager, Engineer Tariro Muka said the power from the solar panels feeds into the national grid through the 88KV Norton to Mazowe powerline, reiterating the need to embrace clean energy.\n\nConsidering issues of global warming and climate change, it is important for us to go green. That will be a significant step in reducing global warming, said Muka.\n\nEnergy expert, Munashe Ngwerume told NewZimbabwe.com that locally-funded solar power plants could help alleviate the countrys electricity generation shortfall in a short space of time.\n\nSolar plants of this size can be built fairly quickly and can be up and running in under a year. The biggest challenge experienced by independent power producers in Zimbabwe is lack of funding.\n\nWith foreign funding having proven to be difficult to secure for most developers for over a decade due to several factors, including the countrys high risk profile, a locally-funded model based on the learnings from Centragrids first 25MW plant as well as the government putting its own resources into the mix as it did with the accelerated road rehabilitation project, could change the game for local IPPs, said Ngwerume.\n\nAt current pricing, Ngwerume emphasised, going solar is attractive right now due to the incredible reduction in the price of solar panels.\n\nA 25MWp solar PV plant can now probably be constructed for about $20 million in this part of the world at current prices.\n\nThis cost includes all the development, permitting, and construction costs up to the Commercial Operation Date (COD)Zimbabwe has 10 provinces, they could even build one plant in each province for easier integration into the grid and also spread the solar love around the country equitably.\n\nAdding four of these 25MW plants to each province would get 1GWp of good installed nameplate solar capacity in a very short time.\n\nNgwerume said Zimbabwe needs cheaper, faster-to-build electricity generation plants hence the Centragrid solar PV project aligns with governments efforts in scaling up renewable energy capacity\n\nGovernment has targeted to generate 16.5% of total electricity or 1,100 MW from renewables by 2025, and 26.5 % of total generation or 2,100 MW from renewables by 2030.\n\nThe investment comes at a time when Zimbabwe faces a power deficit of around 600 MW to 700 MW, according to energy estimates by authorities. This deficit is due to severe climate changes that lowered the dam levels at the countrys largest electricity generation station, the Kariba South Hydro Power Plant.\n\nCentragrid founder and managing director, Victor Utedzi was recently quoted in the media expressing pride in the project, highlighting the importance of local investment in driving Africas energy future.\n\nThis flagship project stands as a testament to what can be accomplished by local investors in Africa in the pursuit of alleviating energy shortages, Utedzi said.\n\nThe Nyabira solar plant is one of the first IPPs to connect to Zimbabwes national grid, and its expansion further cements its role as a key player in the countrys renewable energy landscape. The increased capacity will contribute to the national grid, offering much-needed relief to Zimbabwes energy supply challenges.\n\nThe success of this project is seen as a model for other renewable energy initiatives across the country, with hopes that more locally funded projects will follow suit to reduce dependency on external capital and improve energy security.\n\nUtedzi said the project was critical to Zimbabwes intention to add about 4 000 MW of electricity by 2030, given the growing demand for electricity.\n\nHe acknowledged there is a lot of demand for electricity in new industries coming up, taking advantage of favourable investment conditions created by President Emmerson Mnangagwas government.\n\nMining, agricultural, manufacturing and tourism sectors are growing significantly and demand more electricity.\n\nSo, we need to add more electricity to this country and Centragrid is that first step of the large-scale renewable energy projects that are adding to electricity generation in Zimbabwe, said Utedzi.\n\nLiu Yachen, the Sinohydro project manager for the solar project said at the peak of the project, employed about 400 locals and about 10 Chinese experts.\n\n",

The actual daily generation is roughly half of that.\n\n",

            "content": "AP\n\nBatsirai Pabwe picked detergents, toothpaste, snacks and some pasta among several grocery items spread on the tarmac of a car parking space  an unorthodox night bazaar lit by cellphone flashlights and fluorescent lamps inZimbabwescapital, Harare.\n\nTraditional stores are struggling to survive as the volatility ofZimbabwes new currency pushes prices up. Many like Pabwe now shun them for much cheaper informal markets that pop up at night to avoid the glare of authorities.\n\nFrom dusk, sidewalks, store or office verandahs and car parking spaces burst into unorthodox open air bazaars, offering anything from groceries to fresh meat, electronics, clothes, medicines, fashion accessories and stationery.\n\nUnfettered by expenses such as rising energy costs, taxes and laws that force formal retailers to accept the local currency at artificially low official exchange rates, informal traders, including children, offer better bargains. A box of juice that sells for $3 in a supermarket costs half of that on the street.\n\nIts my first time shopping here. My friend told me that its much cheaper than the supermarkets, 30-year-old Pabwe said, visibly relieved as he filled up a plastic bag with items for just $20. I decided to give it a try and I really enjoyed it.\n\nThe once-prosperous southern African nation of 15 million people in April introduced a new gold-backed currency called ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, to replace one that had been battered by depreciation and often outright rejection by the people.\n\nIt is the countrys sixth attempt at a new currency since the spectacular 2009 collapse of the Zimbabwe dollar and adoption of the U.S. dollar as legal tender amid hyperinflation of 5 billion percent, one of the worlds worst currency crashes to date. The U.S. dollar has since remained legal tender alongside successive local currencies.\n\nThe latest currency, the worlds newest, came with pomp and fanfare  promotional catchy jingles and songs played repeatedly on public radio, television and online.\n\nSeven months on, the ZiG seems to be tanking, like its predecessors. The gap between official and black market exchange rates continues to widen, with many people and informal traders who dominate the economy again preferring the more stable dollar.\n\nTraditional stores, forced by authorities to charge using the local currency, are increasing prices to make ends meet. But they have also become uncompetitive against unregulated informal markets, the Retailers Association of Zimbabwe, an industry representative group, said in September.\n\nIt warned of store closures, saying the situation is clearly untenable.\n\nIn October, Pick n Pay, one of Africas biggest grocery chains that operates more than 70 stores jointly with a local partner in Zimbabwe, said that it had impaired its investment in Zimbabwe to a book value of zero because of the deteriorating economic conditions.\n\nIn every transaction business is doing in the formal setup, its making an exchange rate loss that cannot be compensated. The major issue here is a currency crisis, said Gift Mugano, an economics professor. Huge overheads worsen the retailers situation.\n\nEverything is against their survival. The informal sector works at night, (if there is) no electricity they use their phones, they dont care. They are there for survival, Mugano said.\n\nThe contrast is palpable in Harares Central Business District, where only a few shoppers solemnly scanned prices in a supermarket on a recent day.\n\nSoothing music played from speakers inside but was drowned out by the buzz created outside by hordes of street vendors shouting out bargains to a sea of shoppers.\n\nBusiness is booming, said Oswald Gari, a vendor, adding that he only works at night when the police leave.\n\nGari, 51, said hes fending for his six children and four nephews under his care from the night trade. He harbors no hope of finding formal employment in a country where once roaring industrial sites are being turned into giant warehouses for imported goods, many which end up on the streets, and rail tracks are now overgrown with weeds.\n\nMore than 80% of Zimbabwes employable population ekes out a living in the informal sector, according to official figures and the International Labor Organization.\n\nFor Pabwe, shopping from the informal night markets means less headaches.\n\nIts quite confusing, especially for people like me who really dont understand the value of the ZiG. I always get confused when I get into supermarkets, he said.\n\nHe was satisfied with his shopping at night bazaar.\n\nI got everything I was looking for and the pricing is really affordable. I actually managed to buy a handful for just $20. I even got my washing powder and dishwashing liquid, he said. I think I will do this more often.\n\n",

            "content": "AP\n\nAngelina JolieandBrad Pitthave reached a divorce settlement, her lawyer said Monday, bringing an apparent end to one of the longest and most contentious divorces in Hollywood history.\n\nJolies attorney James Simon confirmed to The Associated Press that the couple had come to a deal. News of the settlement was first reported by People magazine.\n\nMore than eight years ago, Angelina filed for divorce from Mr. Pitt, Simon said in a statement. She and the children left all of the properties they had shared with Mr. Pitt, and since that time she has focused on finding peace and healing for their family. This is just one part of a long ongoing process that started eight years ago. Frankly, Angelina is exhausted, but she is relieved this one part is over.\n\nNo court documents have been filed yet, and a judge will need to sign off on the agreement. An email late Monday night to Pitts attorney seeking comment was not immediately answered.\n\nJolie, 49, and Pitt, 61, were among Hollywoods most prominent couples for 12 years. The two Oscar winners have six children together.\n\nJoliefiled for divorce in 2016,after a private jet flight from Europe during which she said Pitt was abusive toward her and their children. A judge in 2019declared them divorced and single,but the splitting of assets and child custody needed to be separately settled.\n\nA private judge that the two had hired to handle the case reached a decision soon after that included equal custody of their children, but Joliefiled to have him removedfrom the case over an unreported conflict of interest. An appeals court agreed, the judge was removed, and the couple had to start over.\n\nNo details of the agreement were immediately revealed, and the couples use of the private judge  an increasingly common move among splitting celebrities in recent years  has kept the proceedings largely under wraps. Some details, however, have been revealed through a separate lawsuit filed by Pitt, in which he alleged Jolie reneged on an agreement that she would sell him her half of a French winery the two owned together. Its not clear how the divorce agreement will affect that lawsuit.\n\n",
