            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Supreme Court has dismissed an appeal by a Harare lawyer, Samantha Nhende, challenging a High Court ruling that found she was in a tacit universal partnership with her former partner, Andrew Zigora, effectively upholding the division of their jointly acquired property.\n\nThe ruling reinforces the growing judicial recognition of tacit universal partnerships in Zimbabwe, particularly in relationships governed by customary law but exhibiting economic interdependence and joint contribution akin to civil marriages.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, a tacit universal partnership can arise when a couple cohabitates without a formal marriage, and a court determines they were operating as a partnership based on their conduct.\n\nTo establish this, one must prove: each party contributed something to the partnership (money, labour, or skills), the business was for their joint benefit, and the objective was to make a profit.\n\nIn a recent judgment delivered by Justice Hlekani Mwayera, sitting with Justices Susan Mavangira and George Chiweshe, the court ruled that Nhendes appeal had no merit.\n\nThe court also confirmed the lower courts decision to allocate 55% of the property to Nhende and 45% to Zigora.\n\nThe appeal be and is hereby dismissed with no order as to costs, the Supreme Court ruled.\n\nThe parties entered into an unregistered customary law union on 1 August 2010 and later dissolved it in February 2021.\n\nThroughout the subsistence of the union, both parties were formally employed.\n\nNhende earned US$2,000 monthly as a legal officer, while Zigora was also formally employed by a leading telecommunications company, receiving a gross monthly salary of US$5,000.\n\nPrior to the parties entering into the customary law union, Nhende owned a stand in Manresa Suburb, which was allocated to her by her employer.\n\nZigora also owned a stand in Madokero Suburb.\n\nDuring the union, on 1 November 2015, the parties moved into a flat in Avondale.\n\nThey split financial responsibilities with Zigora responsible for paying rentals of US$550 per month and utilities.\n\nNhende was accountable for food, clothes and maintenance of the house.\n\nWith time, the parties agreed to purchase a property in Mabelreign.\n\nThey mutually secured a mortgage home loan facility through Nhendes bank. The title was thus in Nhendes name.\n\nZigoras stand in Madokero was used as collateral for the mortgage loan.\n\nHe also made deposits into Nhendes bank account, including payments for the home insurance of the property.\n\nZigora also made contributions towards the renovations of the property.\n\nThe parties also incurred and shared medical bills in their efforts to undergo medical procedures to help Nhende conceive.\n\nThe medical issue led to the fallout of the parties, culminating in the dissolution of their customary law union.\n\nZigora approached the court a quo seeking an order for the distribution of the matrimonial property of the parties.\n\nHe argued that the parties unregistered customary law union was a tacit universal partnership in which both parties contributed individually and collectively to the acquisition of the property.\n\nAfter obtaining the mortgage bond, Nhendes salary was centred on the repayments of the loan, whereas he catered for all other expenses, including the renovations of the property, as it had been purchased to be a matrimonial home.\n\nThe parties intended to raise a family on that property.\n\nNhende in the High Court averred that there was no tacit universal partnership between herself and the respondent, because they each managed their finances individually, even though they were staying as husband and wife.\n\nShe argued that the concept of tacit universal partnership does not apply to customary law unions.\n\nThe property in question, located at 2 Glynde Avenue, Mabelreign, was purchased during the parties unregistered customary law union, which lasted from August 2010 to February 2021.\n\nThough the property was registered in Nhendes name and the mortgage was drawn from her salary, the court found that Zigora contributed significantly to the household, renovations, and insurance, and had even offered his own property in Madokero as collateral for the mortgage loan.\n\nThe High Court had ruled that the property was jointly owned through a tacit universal partnershipa finding Nhende contested on appeal.\n\nNhendes legal counsel, Mr. T. Mapuranga, argued that the High Court erred in law by finding a tacit universal partnership without direct evidence of pooled finances or shared ownership intentions. He further contended that the court failed to consider Zigoras Madokero stand as part of the parties combined estate and that improvements made by Zigora should have been addressed under unjust enrichment rather than as contributions justifying ownership.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court disagreed.\n\nJustice Mwayera wrote: Their conduct during the acquisition and development of the property meets the requirements of a tacit universal partnership The parties consistently consulted each other on every intricate detail relating to the acquisition and renovation of the property.\n\nMwayera noted that the doctrine of tacit universal partnership applies where individuals in a close personal relationship contribute jointlyfinancially or otherwisefor their shared benefit, even outside a formal legal marriage.\n\nOn the issue of law application, the court reinforced that when customary law is inadequate to resolve a property dispute equitably, general law principles, such as tacit universal partnership and unjust enrichment, may justifiably be invoked.\n\nAddressing the division of the property, the court held that the High Court exercised its discretion judiciously by acknowledging both parties contributions.\n\nRegarding the Madokero property, the Supreme Court concurred with the respondents argument that it was irrelevant to the current dispute as it was not part of the pleadings before the High Court and had been acquired before the union.\n\n",

Consequently, street vending and night vending activities are also banned. Please take note, street fathers.\n\nThe minister cited concerns over illegal drug and substance deals taking place under the cover of night vending, warning that such activities pose a threat to public health, the economy, and national security.\n\nGarwe urged Harare City Council to work closely with the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) to enforce the directive.\n\nHe called on law enforcement agencies to implement existing by-laws with sensitivity, especially in light of past incidents where civilians were injured during street clean-up operations.\n\nIn the past, when street clean-ups were initiated, there was no need to harass anyone. You can begin by engaging associations representing the vendors, Garwe said.\n\nEnforcement should not be about being tough or brutal. Please carry it out in a humane manner. We must educate the public while making tough decisions.\n\nHe also called on the Council to urgently address the worsening traffic congestion in the city.\n\nThe current state of traffic is unacceptable. I call upon the Council to invoke and strengthen existing by-laws to restore order and improve traffic management in our city, Garwe added.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZANU PF Legal Secretary Patrick Chinamasa has said controversial businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei is now a member of the partys Central Committee and the matter is over and irreversible.\n\nTagwireis co-option into the Central Committee has dragged on, with a faction within the ruling party reportedly opposed to his endorsement into the influential organ.\n\nIn a statement posted on socialmedia, Chinamasa said, The Zanupf Department of Legal Affairs is relieved and takes note that the furore/controversy/confusion/wrangle/much ado about nothing/social media hype/misinformation/disinformation that surrounded Harare Provincial Coordinating Committee (PCC) co-option of Cde Kudakwashe Tagwirei into the Zanu PF Central Committee is now over and irreversibly settled.\n\nFrom the outset, it was difficult to understand the source of the problem. Our Harare PCC convened on Monday, 31 March 2025, and voted to recommend the cooption of Cde Tagwirei into the Central Committee.\n\nThe Province addressed the letter of recommendation to the Zanupf Secretary General, Cde Dr. Obert Moses Mpofu. The letter was copied to the Departments of the Commissariat and Legal Affairs, amongst others.\n\nThe confirmation by Chinamsa is in contradiction with the ZANU PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwasremarks earlier this month that Tagwireis bribe would not work in the party.\n\nTagwireis admission into this elite structure is being widely interpreted as part of a long-term strategy to position him for a future presidential bid, setting him on a collision course with other factions, particularly those aligned with Vice President Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nThe ZANU PF benefactor has been viewed as exploiting his proximity to President Emmerson Mnangagwa to push his leadership agenda.\n\nChinamasa acknowledged that the co-option of Tagwirei has been divisive in the ruling party.\n\nSo the controversy surrounding Cde Tagwireis co-option into the Central Committee surprises me and took me completely off guard. Given Cde Tagwireis commitment to Zanupf and his track record in the service of the Party, the somewhat negative publicity and narrative surrounding his co-option into the Central Committee is undeserved.\n\nI have been a member of the Zanupf Central Committee continuously and without break since December 1987, and a member of the Zanupf Politburo since the year 2000 to date, and I can state unequivocally that throughout this long period of nearly 38 years as Central Committee or as Politburo, we have never had to debate, let alone discuss, PCC recommendations of cooptions into the Central Committee. We always treated such recommendations as fait accompli.\n\nThe cooption of Cde Tagwirei is the first ever to be the subject of discussion and social media commentaries. The only explanation why the Tagwirei cooption has attracted such controversy may be because there are people out there who, for reasons best known to themselves, have an axe to grind, said Chinamasa.\n\n",
