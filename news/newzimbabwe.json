It injured 26 others, state media said on Tuesday, as challenging on-site rescue work continued a day after the incident.\n\nThe blast occurred shortly before 8:30 am Monday at a factory in a village outside Changde, a city in Hunan province, state-run China National Radio (CNR) said.\n\nAs of 9:00 am on Tuesday, nine people were dead and 26 injured, CNR said, citing a rescue command centre.\n\nRescue work at the scene was ongoing, CNR reported, noting a complicated situation and the risk of additional explosions hampering response efforts.\n\nAdding to the challenge, the site was in a mountainous area with no large water source, it added.\n\nDuring more than 20 hours of uninterrupted and continuous rescue, the rescue team used remote-controlled water cannons to extinguish the fire, the report said.\n\nState news agency Xinhua also said Tuesday that the Ministry of Emergency Management had sent a working team to Hunan to oversee the rescue.\n\nEfforts must be made to ascertain the cause of the explosion as soon as possible and to hold those responsible accountable, the ministry said, according to Xinhua.\n\nIndustrial accidents are fairly common in China due to vague regulations and lax safety standards.\n\nLast month, an explosion at a chemical plant in the eastern province of Shandong killed at least five people.\n\nIn 2015, blasts at warehouses containing flammable chemicals in the port city of Tianjin killed more than 170 people and injured 700 others.\n\n",

The deceased was employed at Bakers Inn as a driver and also did welding and operated a tuckshop to augment his salary, wrote Saurombe in the letters served on the two.\n\nAccording to Saurombe, Juruvenges widow is presently pregnant.\n\nHe said the death of Juruvenge at the hands of Ndavambi means that his clients have lost their source of financial support.\n\nFurthermore, our clients are distressed and traumatised by the sudden and callous death of their husband, son and brother at the hands of Constable Ndavambi and are presently receiving psychological assistance from medical professionals.\n\nConstable Prince Ndavambi intentionally and unlawfully caused the death of the deceased in that he continuously assaulted the deceased, realising the possibility that death would eventuate from the assaults but nonetheless proceeded with his assaults on the deceased.\n\nIn any event, Constable Ndavambi had boasted to the deceaseds sister, Mellisa, that the deceased was going to be put into a coffin, thus showing that Ndavambi had formed his murderous intent while he was assaulting the deceased.\n\nSaurombe also said the death of the deceased was due to the injuries sustained from the assaults perpetrated on him by Ndavambi.\n\nHe said the murder of Juruvenge at the hands of Ndavambi was a violation of his sacrosanct right to life, which is guaranteed in terms of section 48 of the Zimbabwean Constitution.\n\nFurther and in the alternative, the Officer in Charge at Ruwa Police Station failed in his duty of care to ensure that police officers at his station and under his command do not use the police premises as torture chambers or to endanger the lives of members of the public and hence the breach of this duty of care negligently caused the death of the deceased.\n\nThe assaults by Ndavambi on Mellisa Manyepa and the deceased amount to inhuman, degrading treatment and excessive use of force.\n\nYou are vicariously liable for the damage and harm suffered by our clients because Constable Ndavambi was acting within the scope and course of his duties when he fatally assaulted the deceased and assaulted Mellisa Manyepa.\n\nFurther, the conduct of the police officers in question is a breach of the constitutional obligation of the police service to protect and secure the lives of Zimbabwean citizens as provided for in terms of Section 219(1) (c) of the Constitution.\n\nAccordingly, please be advised of our clients intention to sue for the aforementioned damages in terms of the State Liabilities Act as read with section 70 of the Police Act [Chapter 11:10), the sum of which is to be computed in and furnished to yourselves in the Summons commencing action, read the letter.\n\n",

He will, therefore, effectively serve nine months behind bars.\n\nThe prosecutor proved that on May 24, 2024, the complainant, a 29-year-old teacher at a school in Binga, attempted to withdraw US$300 from an ATM. After inserting her card and completing the transaction, the machine failed to dispense the cash.\n\nAs a result of the malfunctioning ATM, the complainant went inside the bank to enquire. While doing that, the ATM dispensed cash, and the offender seized the opportunity and took the lucky money.\n\nThe court further heard that bank staff, unaware of the incident, helped serve the client and facilitated the withdrawal of US$300 manually.\n\nOn July 2 last year, the bank, during routine reconciliations, discovered that the complainant had double benefited and debited the US$300 from her account.\n\nIt was heard that during investigations, closed-circuit television (CCTV) footage from the day of the withdrawals revealed the offender walking away from the ATM with the lucky cash after the complainant had gone inside the premises.\n\n",
