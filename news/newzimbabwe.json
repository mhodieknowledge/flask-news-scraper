The significant increase in both tonnes milled and the surface stockpile provide a strong foundation for the remainder of the year.\n\nThe performance was an excellent start and with a strong gold price we are well positioned to generate healthy cash flows and to continue investing in our growth projects, he added.\n\n",

The couple divorced in 2021 after 27 years of marriage.\n\nShe says in her autobiography: That October, things had reached a fever pitch when The New York Times published a deeply disturbing article that raised serious questions about Bills conduct  questions that suggested he had betrayed not only our marriage but also my values.\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Bill, 69, met Epstein on numerous occasions, including one visit that reportedly lasted for hours.\n\nIn an email to colleagues in 2011 after their first meeting, Bill wrote: His lifestyle is very different and kind of intriguing although it would not work for me.\n\nIn an interview with The Wall Street Journal earlier this year, Bill acknowledged his regret over associating with Epstein, saying: In retrospect, I was foolish to spend any time with him. I think I was quite stupid. I thought it would help me with global health philanthropy. In fact, it failed to do that. It was just a huge mistake.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, Epstein allegedly used knowledge of an affair between Bill and Russian bridge player Mila Antonova to pressure him into joining a multibillion-dollar charitable fund with JPMorgan Chase in 2017.\n\nMelinda previously addressed her concerns about Bills relationship with Epstein in a 2022 interview, saying: I did not like that he had meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, no. I made that clear to him.\n\nShe added that she met Epstein only once, saying: I wanted to see who he was. I regretted it the second I walked in the door. He was abhorrent. He was evil personified. My heart breaks for these women.\n\nIn The Next Day, Melinda also writes ending her marriage was one of the most difficult decisions of her life.\n\nShe says in the book: Leaving my marriage was one of the hardest and most important things Ive ever done.\n\nMelinda and Bill have three adult children  Jennifer, 28, Rory, 25, and Phoebe, 22  and she is now in a relationship with entrepreneur Philip Vaughn, while Bill is dating Paula Hurd.\n\n",

On April 10, 2025, police recovered 11 cattle which were stolen from Mildred Patsika aged 80 years by her nephew Alexender Mhalasi (52), said Kohwera.\n\nCircumstances are that sometime between February and December 2024, the complainant entrusted her nephew, Mhalasi to look after her 11 cattle since she was not feeling well.\n\nThe complainants health deteriorated and she relocated to Kwekwe for further treatment. It was during this period that her nephew sold all 11 cattle and invested the money in his mining activities.\n\nHowever, the complainant recovered from illness and returned to Selous, where she later learnt from the accuseds wife, Emma Gutu, that all the beasts were sold on the pretext that the money was being channelled to her medical expenses.\n\nA report of stocktheft was made on April 10, 2025, at ZRP Dombwe Base, Selous. Police attended the scene and pursued the accused who had driven off towards the Saruwe area to evade arrest, further said Kohwera.\n\nInformation was sent to Saruwe Police Station, who laid a roadblock but somehow the accused evaded the checkpoint.\n\nMore information came that accused was seen driving towards Kadoma en route to Empress Mine. Working on the information, police swiftly reacted and arrested Mhalasi at Waverly, Kadoma.\n\nPolice interviewed the suspect and he led to the recovery of all the 11 cattle in the Msengezi area where they were sold.\n\nThe provincial spokesperson urged members of the public to ensure that whenever they want to buy stock, they must undertake a proper verification process.\n\nPolice must be involved in the clearing to ensure that the stock is not stolen.\n\nZRP continues to warn all cattle rustlers that the full wrath of the law will soon catch up with them since police officers are doing their best to bust syndicates, said Kohwera.\n\n",

Police officers on deployment will impound all unroadworthy and defective vehicles and arrest any driver found to be driving under the influence of alcohol, the commissioner-general warned.\n\nCrime and traffic awareness campaigns, stop and search operations shall be carried out to combat armed robberies, murder, rape, stocktheft, drugs and substance misuse cases.\n\nMutamba called on parents and guardians to monitor children to curb drug and substance misuse during the merry-making period.\n\nHe also appealed to citizens to reportany drug peddlers and havens. Unlicensed liquor outlets were also not spared from Mutambas watchful eye.\n\nZRP will also ensure that liquor outlets fully comply with the provisions of the Liquor Act Chapter 14:12. To this end, all unlicensed liquor outlets and shebeens will be closed while the operators will be arrested for the law to take its course. Licensed liquor outlets should stick to stipulated operating times.\n\nThe public was urged to avoid stashing large amounts of money in order to curtail cases of armed robberies.\n\nIn order to minimise chances of robbery cases, the public is again advised not to carry or keep large sums of money at home or business premises. Companies are reminded not to share information on financial transactions or status with each and every employee. This will assist to curtail the leakage of information to criminals, said Mutamba.\n\n",

Launched a year ago, it is backed by 2.5 tons of gold and $100 million in foreign currency reserves held by the central bank.\n\nAbout 80% of transactions in the country are still conducted in U.S. dollars, with some also made in South African rand. Last year, Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa declared that the ZiG would become the sole legal tender by 2030, phasing out the existing multicurrency system.\n\nDespite its gold backing, the ZiG has failed to win public confidence. Its value has declined, and efforts by authorities to encourage widespread adoption have largely fallen flat.\n\nPersistence Gwanyanya, a member of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwes monetary policy committee, pushed back against the Imara report, stating that the liquidity issues are limited to the parallel market, and not the formal banking system.\n\nIts not extinction of ZiG, but unwinding of US dollar positions into the local currency thats next and will help release credit into the economy,Gwanyanya said.\n\nStill, Imara argues that the central banks strategy, particularly its decision to raise interest rates to support the ZiG and fight inflation, is backfiring by encouraging more people to rely on the U.S. dollar.\n\nThe Imara executives emphasized that monetary policy alone wont solve Zimbabwes economic challenges. They urged the government to focus on boosting revenues and curbing deficit spending.\n\nIn a blunt conclusion, they said: It would be better simply to scrap [the ZiG] and move on.\n\n",

They built their lives and businesses here, and they must be part of Africas future, Zanu-PF spokesman Christopher Mutsvangwa is reported as saying.\n\nAfrikaners, like all Africans, have a duty to reinvest in the continent and contribute to its growth.\n\nMnangagwa said it is time to focus on rebuilding Zimbabwe, and that required acknowledging past challenges while working together for a united future.\n\nCapital knows no race, and we are calling on all who identify with this continent to invest in it.\n\nShifting political winds\n\nThe meeting comes the same week that Zimbabwe started compensating dispossessed white farmers with an initial payment of $3.1 million (R58 million) out of a total of $3.5 billion (R66 billion) agreed under the governments 2020 Global Compensation Deed (GCD) pledge.\n\nThis is an agreement to compensate nearly 4 000 former farm owners for the seizure of their farms under the Fast Track Land Reform Programme initiated under former president Robert Mugabe nearly 20 years ago. Payments will be made for improvements to the land, not the land itself.\n\nIn another sign of the shifting political winds in the region, Zimbabwe became the first African country to suspend all tariffs on goods originating in the US, just three days after the US imposed 18% tariffs on exports from Zimbabwe.\n\nIn the spirit of constructing a mutually beneficial and positive relationship with the United States of America, under the leadership of President Trump, I will direct the Zimbabwean government to implement a suspension of all tariffs levied on goods originating from the United States, wrote Mnangagwa on X.\n\nThis measure is intended to facilitate the expansion of American imports within the Zimbabwean market, while simultaneously promoting the growth of Zimbabwean exports destined for the United States.\n\nThis action underscores our commitment to a framework of equitable trade and enhanced bilateral cooperation.\n\nThe dropping of tariffs on US goods and paying out dispossessed white farmers is part of a charm offensive by Harare to unlock international financing and re-engage with international financial institutions like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.\n\nMixed reactions in Zimbabwe\n\nThe outreach to the Afrikaner business community, with representatives from sectors such as agriculture and energy, has drawn mixed reactions in Zimbabwe.\n\nSome, such as political analyst Alex Rungunda, see this as a rhetorical departure for Zanu-PF, which historically adopted a confrontational stance on land and race. However, it may also be a sign of desperation, he says, as the country urgently needs capital and goodwill.\n\nWar veterans and land reform activists were less accommodating of the softening stance on historical injustices.\n\nOn Zimbabwes dropping of tariffs on US goods, journalist Hopewell Chinono says the move is more political than economic. Perhaps the president believes this could serve as a sweetener for his removal from the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act sanctions. A long shot though! hewroteon X.\n\nZimbabwe did not coordinate the move with its regional partners, whereas the EU will put forward its response to tariffs as a bloc.\n\nEconomically, it does not make much sense for Mnangagwa to prioritise appeasing the United States in this way  especially through unilateral concessions or alignments, given Zimbabwes trade realities and regional context, says Chinono.\n\nANC uncomfortable with all this\n\nAdvocate Simba Chitando, chair of the Zanu-PF Sandton branch, speaking in his private capacity, says many members of the ANC are uncomfortable with the bridges Zanu-PF is building with the West and with white farmers, which will lead to rapid economic growth.\n\nThey dont want Harare to reach its potential, because they believe Pretoria would be weaker, and black South Africans poorer than black Zimbabweans, he said.\n\nA fear that is at the root of xenophobia, and tensions between the two people.\n\nHowever, the world can no longer ignore the fact that Zimbabwe is on the rise while South Africa is on the decline.\n\n",
