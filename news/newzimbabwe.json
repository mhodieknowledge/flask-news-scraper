            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has thrown out an application by convicted sex offender Levison Popi, who sought to review his trial on the grounds that a key defence witness was not called.\n\nJustice Sinabuliso Siziba, sitting at Mutare High Court, ruled that Popis chamber application, filed five months after his conviction, was an afterthought and lacked merit.\n\nThe explanation for the delay is unreasonable. It defies logic why he would obtain advice at that early stage from his inmates and neglect to inquire from his lawyer, Siziba said.\n\nPopi was convicted on 16 December 2024 of attempted indecent assault under Zimbabwes Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act. His initial appeal was struck off the roll in March 2025 for being fatally defective.\n\nHe later argued that the trial magistrate had failed to explain his right to call a witness, Alice Nyanjowa, who has since died. Nyanjowa had previously stated that she was present in the room during the alleged incident but did not observe anything concerning the allegations.\n\nBut the judge found no irregularity in the lower court proceedings.\n\nA perusal of the record indicates in no uncertain terms that the applicant was advised by the trial magistrate of his right to adduce evidence on his own and also through his witnesses. He then testified and also called two witnesses, the judge noted.\n\nThe court further stressed that it was Popis choice, not the courts or the prosecutors, to omit the deceased witness from his defence.\n\nThe prosecutor had no duty or right to choose witnesses for the applicant. He called the other witnesses and left out the very witness that he now complains of having been left out, Siziba ruled.\n\nThe application was dismissed with costs.\n\nPopi was arrested in 2024 after he was accused of attempting to indecently assault a woman. Prosecutors alleged that he made unwanted sexual advances that fell short of full assault but still contravened Zimbabwes criminal statutes.\n\nDuring his trial, Popi denied the allegations and presented two witnesses in his defence. However, the court found the complainants testimony credible and convicted him of attempted indecent assault.\n\nOn appeal, his challenge to the conviction was struck off the roll in March 2025. His latest effort, a chamber application seeking to revive the case by relying on the statement of the now-deceased witness, Alice Nyanjowa has now also failed, leaving his conviction intact.\n\n",

            "content": "Sowetan Live\n\nThe Limpopo pig farmer accused of killing two women who were scavenging for food on his property told the court that when he was alerted to the body of one of his victims, he panicked and left the scene until he returned the following day and put it in an empty pigsty.\n\nHe said he had expected the person who accompanied the intruders to come and collect the body. Then when they discovered the second body the following day, he and his employees also put it in a pigsty.\n\nThis is contained in an affidavit of Zachariah Johannes Olivier, which was read out in the Polokwane high court on Tuesday. Olivier denies that he intentionally killed Maria Makgato, 45 and Locadia Ndlovu, 34, in August last year then fed them to the pigs. Ndlovus husband survived the attack.\n\nHe said he had gone to the to spot where the women were shot expecting to see trespassers and he had tried to frighten them by shooting at them.\n\nOlivier, 60, and co-accused William Musora, 50, entered the second day of the trial yesterday. They face charges of murder, attempted murder, employing an illegal immigrant who does not possess a work permit and the possession of an unlicensed firearm.\n\nMusora, a Zimbabwean national, faces a further charge of contravention of the Immigration Act, for being in SA illegally.\n\nOn Monday, in a panicked state, I proceeded to cut up both rifles that were used to shoot the warning shots into pieces, and I disposed of such pieces as I was scared and disgusted with the rifles and what had transpired\n\nZachariah Johannes Olivier, farmer\n\nIn his affidavit, Olivier claims that after the discovery of the two bodies, he panicked and went home before returning the following day to destroy the guns used to shoot the two women.\n\nOn Monday, in a panicked state, I proceeded to cut up both rifles that were used to shoot the warning shots into pieces, and I disposed of such pieces as I was scared and disgusted with the rifles and what had transpired.\n\nI never had any intention of defeating the purpose of the administration of justice. I simply panicked and acted out of an extreme level of shock.\n\nAccording to Olivier, he called the police the following day as I could not deal with the situation any longer.\n\nThe state has since withdrawn charges against another farmworker, Adrian de Wet, 19, who is now a state witness. In his affidavit, Olivier claims that he was with de Wet on the night that the women were shot. De Wet, he claims, also fired shots.\n\nSpeaking to Sowetan outside court, Makgatos grieving mother said she will never forgive those who cut short her daughters life.\n\nWhy did he have to kill my child in such a brutal manner? Why did he not inform the police that people were trespassing on his farm, asked Moyahabo Mokgato.\n\nThe pensioner said she has been battling to take care of her household as well as her late daughters children aged 5, 12, 16 and 22 since Marias death.\n\nAfter they murdered my child, I am now struggling, as I do not work. Im unable to provide for my family.\n\nI cannot forgive them, she said.\n\nDuring proceedings, judge Jane Ngobeni informed the two men that should they be convicted of murder, they face life in prison. If they are first offenders, the sentence wont be less than 15 years.\n\n",

The 34-year-old striker said returning to South Africa brings back fond memories and added motivation.\n\nI have once played here in South Africa and during my time I did well, so Im looking forward to playing against South Africa, said Musona.\n\nThe game is going to be here in South Africa, so that motivates me a lot as a player who once played here because everyone here knows me as a good player from my time at Kaizer Chiefs.

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nThree months after receiving the Commission of Inquiry Report into the operations of the Harare City Council, President Emmerson Mnangagwa has yet to make its contents public, raising concerns over the governments commitment to addressing deep-rooted corruption at Town House.\n\nThe report, compiled by retired Judge Maphios Cheda and submitted in June 2025, followed more than a year of investigations into allegations of mismanagement, poor service delivery, and financial impropriety at the local authority.\n\nDespite expectations that the findings would help restore order and accountability, the governments silence has sparked fears that corruption will continue unchecked at the Jacob Mafume-led council.\n\nIn an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Harare Residents Trust (HRT) Director Precious Shumba said the delay in releasing the report was undermining efforts to combat graft within the city administration.\n\nHarare Residents Trust (HRT) Director Precious Shumba\n\nThe Harare Residents Trust appeals to the President to release the report of the Commission of Inquiry into the financial matters of the City of Harare without any further delays.\n\nSince the conclusion of the investigation, there has been unhinged corruption. Officials and councillors have engaged in accelerated looting of council funds and assets, especially land.\n\nMinister Daniel Garwe should use his position to request the President to act in the public interest and save the city of Harare from further deterioration at the hands of cartels, said Shumba.\n\nThe Commission heard evidence of severe mismanagement within the council, with senior officials reportedly prioritising lavish salaries and perks over basic service delivery. Testimonies also exposed how councillors colluded with officials to illegally parcel out land across the capital.\n\nCouncil-owned entities such as Harare Quarry, City Parking, and Rufaro Marketing were cited as hubs of corruption, allegedly used to siphon public funds.\n\nObservers believe the unreleased report could contain damning findings and recommendations likely to implicate senior officials.\n\nValuing the interests and needs of the residents of Harare should be seen in the government releasing the report of the Commission of Inquiry, and taking decisive action against anyone implicated in financial impropriety, Shumba added.\n\nWhen President Mnangagwa established the Commission, it was tasked with eight key objectives, including probing the City Councils financial management systems, adherence to procurement laws, and the handling of property sales and leases.\n\nDuring public hearings, witnesses accused the council of routinely violating regulations, highlighting systemic governance failures.\n\nThe government set up the commission of inquiry at the expense of the taxpayers. The delay in acting against the rot is tantamount to endorsing the abuse of public resources, said Shumba.\n\nThis is not the first time a Mnangagwa-appointed commission has been accused of producing reports that gather dust. The 2018 Motlanthe Commission, established to investigate the military killings of civilians after disputed elections, has yet to see its recommendations implemented.\n\nSimilarly, critics warn the Harare City Council inquiry risks becoming another box-ticking exercise.\n\nDuring his appearance before the Cheda Commission last year, former opposition leader Nelson Chamisa questioned the sincerity of the process.\n\nThis is not the first time a commission has been used as a diversion from addressing real issues. In 2018, Mr. Mnangagwa established the Motlanthe Commission following the disputed General Elections.\n\nI was summoned before the commission over a matter entirely unrelated to me. Now in 2023, the same pattern is repeated, where I am once again being drawn into issues far beyond my purview, said Chamisa.\n\nAs the report remains under wraps, corruption at the Harare City Council continues to erode public trustleaving residents to wonder whether the government will ever act on the Commissions findings.\n\n",
