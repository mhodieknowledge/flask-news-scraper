            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nPreliminary investigations have revealed that a circuit breaker supplying the load tripped, causing a power outage at the new Parliament Building during President Emmerson Mnangagwas State of the Nation Address (SONA), Parliamenthas said.\n\nThe unexpected blackout forced Mnangagwa to complete his address using torchlight before electricity was restored approximately ten minutes later.\n\nThis is the second power outage to occur at the Parliament Building in Mnangagwas presence. The first incident took place during Finance Minister Mthuli Ncubes 2025 National Budget Presentation in November last year, which the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) attributed to natural causes.\n\nDespite prior arrangements to ensure backup power, the latest blackout still occurred, prompting Speaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda to hint at possible sabotage.\n\nMudenda warned that the culprit will regret the day of their existence.\n\nNow in damage control mode, Clerk of Parliament Kennedy Chokuda released a statement explainingthe technical cause of the outage.\n\nThe loss of power supply to key systems occurred when the Parliament Building was running on a generator as the main source of supply, with ZESA power as a standby. When supplies were lost, the generator was still running but not supplying power.\n\nPreliminary investigations indicate that a circuit breaker supplying the load had tripped. The restoration took longer than expected, resulting in part of the SONA being delivered without power, Chokuda said.\n\nParliament said it is working with the Ministry of Local Government, ZESA, and other relevant government agencies to investigate the incident. The findings will be made public once investigations are complete, and measures will be put in place to prevent a recurrence.\n\n",

The approach involves maintaining a high bank policy rate, currently at 35%,to curb speculative borrowing, which has been a major driver of excess liquidity and illicit parallel market activity.\n\nOther measures, such as elevated reserve requirements, have also been introduced to control inflation while supporting long-term economic growth.\n\nAs a result, the policy has helped sustain the ZWG currency, which has enjoyed nearly a year of relative stability, encouraging broader acceptance and usage.\n\nPresenting the State of the Nation Address (SONA), Mnangagwa credited the RBZs monetary discipline for fostering a favourable economic environment.\n\nThe tight monetary and fiscal environment in the economy has remained favourable to support sustained economic activity. My Government is diligently implementing the necessary policies, measures, and initiatives to maintain the stability of the ZWG and inflation, he said.\n\nThe President added that the ongoing trend of macroeconomic stability is expected to become a permanent feature of Zimbabwes economy.\n\nHe also highlighted significant progress in the countrys foreign currency generation capacity.\n\nInflows stood at US$10.4 billion as of August 2025, an increase of 26.8% from the US$8.3 billion recorded during the same period in 2024. Consequently, foreign currency reserves rose to about US$900 million by the end of September 2025, up from US$700 million in June 2025.\n\nIn recognition of this progress, the World Bank recently ranked Zimbabwe first among the top 10 countries globally that have made significant gains in foreign currency reserve accumulation. On the fiscal front, I am pleased to advise that we remain steadfast in strengthening sustainable resource mobilisation strategies to ensure the continued provision of public services, Mnangagwa added.\n\n",

            "content": "Finance in Africa\n\nZimbabwe is among the two African nations  alongside Zambia  that are again absent from the Top 100 African Banks 2025 list, according to African Business Magazine.\n\nTheannual ranking, which measures banks financial strengthbased on Tier 1 Capital  the sum of a banks core equity, reserves, and retained earnings  features banks from 20 African countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Togo, Mozambique, Cte dIvoire, Angola, and Gabon.\n\nAccording to the London-based IC publication, Zimbabwes exclusion stems from years of economic shocks, hyperinflation, and currency instability that have eroded the balance sheets of local banks and diminished investor confidence.\n\nGrowth has been stronger since the COVID-19 pandemic, and the World Bank forecasts a 6% increase in GDP this year, so the countrys banks could re-enter our rankings if the economic environment continues to improve, African Business said. Sound government and governance will be key.\n\nDespite recent signs of recovery, Zimbabwes financial sector remains fragile. With a population of about 17 million, the country has faced some of the worlds highest inflation rates, a volatile exchange-rate regime, and frequent shifts in its monetary framework  from the launch of the ZiG (Zimbabwe Gold) currency in April 2024 to ongoing struggles with dollarisation.\n\nAlthough the World Bank classifies Zimbabwe as a lower-middle-income country, its economy continues to be constrained by policy inconsistencies, low foreign investment, and chronic power shortages.\n\nIn 2024, the Bank said GDP growth slowed to 1.7% largely due to drought-induced agricultural declines and energy supply disruptions.\n\nZimbabwe continues to be in debt distress, with high and unsustainable public debt that limits its access to international financing. Due to the accumulation of external arrears and legacy debts, total public debt reached $23.2 billion in 2024 (72.9% of GDP), the multilateral lender said in a recent report.\n\nThe country has been in non-accrual status to the World Bank since 2000 and is also in arrears to the African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank.\n\nBut last July, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube projected that growth would rebound to around six percent in 2025, supported by improved crop yields and stronger commodity prices. However, according to International Monetary Fund data, inflation remains above 30%, while access to credit is still limited.\n\nThese structural weaknesses have made it difficult for Zimbabwean banks to meet the capitalisation thresholds required to compete with their peers across the continent.\n\nIn contrast, Mauritius has positioned itself as one of Africas leading financial centres. The government, through the Mauritius International Financial Centre, is leveraging the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to facilitate cross-border trade and attract regional investment.\n\nThe Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) remains the largest nonSouth African lender, with Tier 1 capital of $1.5 billion, up from $1.4 billion last year. Six Mauritian banks are now ranked among Africas top 20. Angola and Mozambique each contributed three banks, while Namibia had two.\n\nMCB operates across Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Seychelles, and South Africa, and has expanded internationally to Dubai, France, and the Maldives.\n\nIt has also embraced technology by adopting a unified Temenos banking platform and introducing AI-driven credit scoring to strengthen lending and manage non-performing loans.\n\nSouth Africas financial giants once again dominate the Southern African rankings, occupying the top six positions. Despite the rise of digital-first banks, none have yet broken into the regional top 20.\n\nStandard Bank remains the largest lender in Africa, while Absa Bank recorded the highest growth in Tier 1 capital, rising from $4.7 billion in 2024 to $5.6 billion in 2025.\n\nThe combined capital of the top 20 banks in Southern Africa climbed from $37.4 billion to $40.4 billion over the past year, though growth was largely concentrated among the biggest players.\n\nIn West and Central Africa, total Tier 1 capital fell from $15.6 billion to $14.9 billion as lenders grappled with macroeconomic headwinds. Nigeria still dominates the region with 12 banks on the list, followed by Cte dIvoire (3), Ghana (2), and one each from Togo, Gabon, and the DRC.\n\nAccess Bank has overtaken FirstBank and now trails Zenith Bank, which ranks as the biggest lender in the region. Ecobank Transnational remains the largest non-Nigerian bank, followed by BGFI Gabon, whose Tier 1 capital surged to $1.3 billion from $844 million in 2024.\n\nAfrican Business noted that Nigerias banking sector continues to evolve through waves of consolidation driven by the Central Bank of Nigerias new capital requirements.\n\nIn March 2024, the CBN raised minimum capital thresholds to 500 billion ($333 million) for international banks, 200 billion ($134 million) for national banks, and 50 billion ($33 million) for regional and merchant banks.\n\nNorth Africa remains the continents most financially robust region, led by Egypt and Morocco.\n\nEgypts National Bank of Egypt tops the regional table with $7.3 billion in Tier 1 capital, followed by Moroccos Attijariwafa Bank ($6.2 billion), Banque Centrale Populaire ($5.2 billion), and Egypts Banque Misr ($4.8 billion).\n\nMoroccan banks continue to benefit from early expansion into sub-Saharan Africa, boosting profits and cross-border connections. BCP, which operates in 32 countries (18 in Africa), reported a 16.8% increase in half-year profit to 3.5 billion dirhams ($386 million) in 2025.\n\nKenya continues to drive East Africas banking growth, led by Equity Bank ($1.9 billion), KCB Group ($1.7 billion), and Co-operative Bank of Kenya ($927 million)  all ranking among the fastest-growing institutions by Tier 1 capital.\n\nEthiopia isalso emerging as a rising player, with six banks now in the East African top 20, following banking-sector liberalisation. The countrys rapid 9% annual economic growth and large population of 135 million position it for further expansion as deregulation opens space for domestic and foreign lenders.\n\n",
