            "content": "Zimbabwe Cricket\n\nWellington Masakadza claimed a career-best four-wicket haul, but Zimbabwe were left clinging to hope after South Africa set a towering fourth-innings target of 537 on day three of the first Test at Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo on Monday.\n\nWiaan Mulders commanding 147 formed the backbone of the visitors second-innings 369, building on their overnight score of 49 for one and a lead of 216.\n\nThe imposing total left Zimbabwe with the daunting task of pulling off the greatest chase in Test history.\n\nWith Blessing Muzarabani unavailable in the morning due to illness, the hosts turned to Tanaka Chivanga and Masakadza to spearhead the attack.\n\nThe day began promisingly for them when Tony de Zorzi, on 22 overnight, edged Chivanga to second slip, where Sean Williams held a sharp, low catch.\n\nMulder, calm and clinical, raced to his fifty with a string of crisp boundaries.\n\nHe then combined with David Bedingham for a brisk 72-run stand that extended South Africas lead beyond 300.\n\nMasakadza broke the partnership, tempting Bedingham, on 35, into a mistimed pull that found Williams at midwicket.\n\nSoon after, debutant Lhuan-dre Pretorius  fortunate to survive several chances in his first-innings hundred  was bowled for four by Vincent Masekesa, ripping one through the gate to clip the top of middle stump.\n\nMasekesa struck again moments later, removing Dewald Brevis for three as the big-hitters wild attempt to clear long-on missed entirely, and the leg-spinner knocked over his stumps to leave South Africa teetering at 155 for five.\n\nBut Mulder stood firm amid the wobble.\n\nHe brought up a well-earned hundred off 149 deliveries with a crisp back-foot drive.\n\nAt lunch, the visitors were 185 for five, leading by 352, with Mulder on 104 and Kyle Verreynne on five.\n\nAfter the break, the pair added 74 before Mulders enterprising stay came to an end.\n\nHe attempted to go aerial against Wessly Madhevere but picked out deep midwicket, where Takudzwanashe Kaitano took a fine catch.\n\nMulders 206-ball innings featured 17 boundaries and two sixes.\n\nMasakadza soon added Verreynne to his tally, drawing an edge off a sharply turning delivery that Ervine pouched at slip, reducing South Africa to 259 for seven.\n\nMaharaj and Corbin Bosch then piled on more frustration for Zimbabwe with a gritty 92-run partnership for the eighth wicket, pushing the lead beyond the 500-run mark.\n\nMuzarabani, now back in action, thought he had Bosch caught behind  only for a no-ball call to spoil the celebration.\n\nBut Bosch didnt last much longer as Masakadza bowled him for 36 after a missed slog-sweep.\n\nMasakadza then removed Maharaj, who danced down the track only to be deceived in flight and turn  the ball crashing into middle stump as South Africa fell to 352 for nine.\n\nMuzarabani wrapped up the innings by bowling Kwena Maphaka for eight, with Codi Yusuf unbeaten on the same score.\n\nMasakadza finished with four for 98, his career-best innings figures in Test cricket, while Masekesa and Chivanga chipped in with two wickets apiece.\n\nSet a colossal 537 for victory, Zimbabwe began cautiously in the final hour.\n\nOpeners Kaitano and Prince Masvaure looked solid  until the very last ball of the day.\n\nJust as the hosts seemed set to survive the session unscathed, Kaitano edged Bosch to second slip, ending a steady 32-run stand.\n\nThey closed on 32 for one, still needing 505 runs with nine wickets in hand.\n\nZimbabwe have passed 500 in an innings six times in Test cricket, most recently in December against Afghanistan at the same venue.\n\nBut their highest fourth-innings total is 331  made in a losing cause against New Zealand in 2001, also in Bulawayo.\n\nTheir most successful chase remains 174, achieved earlier this year against Bangladesh in Sylhet.\n\nThe next best, 162, came back in 1998 against Pakistan.\n\nThe world record fourth-innings chase is 418  set by the West Indies against Australia in 2003.\n\nWith history stacked high against them, Zimbabwe will need to bat with extraordinary discipline, determination and belief to salvage anything from this match.\n\n",

This development follows EJWPs submission of an urgent petition on 14 March 2025, calling for the renewal of the policy, which had lapsed in 2021  a gap that threatened to reverse hard-earned gains in gender equity, she said.\n\nThe CSO described the new policy as a foundation for a more inclusive, equitable and gender-responsive Zimbabwe, with clearly defined strategies to address systemic barriers across legal, economic, health, education, climate, and digital spheres.\n\nThe new policy, EJWP said, marks a shift from aspiration to action  offering a renewed national mandate to address entrenched gender disparities.\n\nAs EJWP, we remain deeply committed to supporting the full implementation of this policy, particularly around inclusive economic empowerment and accountability in public resource management. We will continue to monitor progress, engage with duty bearers, and amplify the voices of women, especially those in marginalised and economically excluded communities, added Mutsamvi.\n\n",

Through the Fostering Digital Villages Initiative (FDiVi), FAO hosted a Digital Fair in the Masvingo province.\n\nThe digital fair brought together digital service providers, farmers, agri-entrepreneurs, and other stakeholders, creating a dynamic platform for knowledge exchange and real-time onboarding to digital agriculture solutions. The digital fair is part of the broader Fostering Digital Villages through innovative advisory and profitable market services project, which aims to transform agrifood systems in rural Malawi, Rwanda, and Zimbabwe using effective digital technologies, including artificial intelligence.\n\nThis project facilitates delivery of innovative agricultural extension services for increased productivity, enhanced market access, and advance inclusive rural transformation. It will also support local farmers, extension officers, agro-dealers, and processors, particularly the youth and women.\n\nPatrice Talla, FAO Subregional Coordinator for Southern Africa and Representative, Zimbabwe.\n\nThe digital fair held in the Bikita district is part of a series of the ongoing campaign by FAO targeting digital service providers, rural farmers, agri-entrepreneurs and other stakeholders to interact and integrate digital technologies in agriculture. The digital fair sparked renewed enthusiasm for digital transformation in agriculture among local communities.\n\nSpeaking during the digital fair, Bernard Hadzirambwi, the District Development Coordinator, praised the initiative and encouraged farmers to adopt digital technologies to enhance productivity and resilience.\n\nRural innovation thrives when communities connect and interact with digital technology.\n\nBernard Hadzirambwi, the District Development Coordinator, Zimbabwe.\n\nDuring the digital fair, our farmers explored AI-powered advisory tools, mobile market platforms, and digital extension services. I am truly encouraged by how quickly the community is embracing these innovations. Digital technologies are not just tools, they are enablers of climate-smart agriculture and inclusive rural development in our district.\n\nNobert Chiduza, District Agricultural Extension Officer in the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development, Zimbabwe.\n\nThe FDiVi is one of FAOs corporate initiatives and flagship programmes. It is an integrated development vision that enshrines digitalization at the core of rural transformation and prosperity, addressing on-farm and off-farm socio-economic elements.\n\nThe project is being implemented in the Mhondoro-Ngezi and Bikita districts where digital hubs will be equipped with digital tools and services including free internet, computers and digital literacy training materials.\n\nThe project supports local farmers, extension officers, agro-dealers, and processors through facilitating access to innovative agricultural extension services, improving market access, and promoting inclusive rural transformation.\n\nBefore the digital fair, I didnt know how much technology could change the way I farm. Now, Ive learned about AI tools that help me plan better, and I can connect directly with buyers through my phone. As a young farmer, this gives me confidence in exploring new opportunities posed through digital technologies.\n\nSheunesu Njeke, a 26-year-old farmer, Zimbabwe.\n\nGoing forward, FAO will integrate Digital Fairs in the annual District and Ward level Agriculture Shows. The project will continue to support digital innovators and entrepreneurs in breaking into the rural market and will also support farmers and other rural stakeholders to safely onboard onto digital platforms and services.\n\n",
