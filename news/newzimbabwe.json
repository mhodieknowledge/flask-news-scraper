Let us not mortgage our nations future to fleeting gain. There can be no room for rent-seeking behaviours or muddy practices in a modern, competitive economy.\n\nTagwirei and Kasukuwere, on the other hand, have been at each others throats, with the former naming the latter on a list he claims is of people who accuse him of corruption but are themselves corrupt.\n\nAs for Kasukuwere, he is one of the most corrupt people I know, said Tagwirei.\n\nKasukuwere, seemingly rattled by the formers recent forays into politics, has been pointing out Tagwireis flaws, including arguing that he is positioning himself to take over the presidency by paying people, telling them that he is anointed, and pushing the narrative that President Emmerson Mnangagwa is sick.\n\nThe former Zanu PF political commissar described Tagwirei as a frog that jumped key positions within the party to land in its central committee.\n\nA good fraudster is not necessarily a good politician. Trying to turn a thief into a leader is the ultimate betrayal of the revolutionary party by a reactionary leader.\n\nThe game has begun and that rimming mouth will not be opened again, said Kasukuwere on X.\n\nBoth men have been beneficiaries of a Zanu PF-controlled economic empowerment system, Kasukuwere having benefited from late president Robert Mugabe, while Tagwirei has been a major beneficiary under Mnangagwa.\n\nThe relationship between Chiwenga and Tagwirei has not been explored despite the former army general sending coded messages against activities either linked or perceived to be linked to Tagwirei.\n\n",

We will never allow charlatans & crooks to take over the State, to emasculate the Constitution, or to buy their way into office. Criminals must know that one day soon, Zimbabwe will rise, and crooks will fall.\n\nA New Zimbabwe must audit all Treasury Bills issued by the Government in the last 20 years.

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nSTIGMA and discrimination remain the most damaging barriers to the countrys national HIV response, Health and Child Care Minister Douglas Mombeshora has said.\n\nAddressing journalists at a Zimbabwe National Network of People Living with HIV (ZNNP+) breakfast meeting in Harare this Thursday, Mombeshora said stigma discouraged vital actions meant to reduce the spread and treatment of HIV.\n\nThe stigma index 2.0 has risen to 69.7% from 65% between 2018 and 2023.\n\nStigma and discrimination remain among the most damaging barriers to Zimbabwes national HIV response.\n\nFor people living with HIV, the impact goes beyond emotional distress. It is structural and systemic. Stigma, isolated individuals, erode their self-worth and discourage vital actions like HIV testing, disclosure and adherence to treatment.\n\nDiscrimination in families, workplaces, health care settings and communities creates fear and silence that allow the virus to spread unchecked, Mombeshora said.\n\nOur collective commitment must be to build a pathway where every person living with HIV is treated with dignity, respect and compassion, free from judgment and fully supported to live a healthy, productive life.\n\nThe minister reported that the World Health Organisation emphasised that quality health care involved not only medicines, access, but also dignity, equity and inclusivity.\n\nDiscrimination in health care, such as segregated queues, bridges of confrontation or denial of care, atomised public trust, discourages service use and perpetuates inequities.\n\nResearch shows internalised stigma leads to shame, isolation, depression and loss of obesity, which reduce mental wellbeing and deter engagement with HIV services, the minister told the media.\n\nHe warned that fear of judgment causes delayed care, increasing risks of late diagnosis and treatment failure, undermining individual and public health.\n\nMombeshora commended the ZNNP+ for playing a pivotal role in shaping the countrys national HIV response.\n\nYou share public awareness, foster accountability and encourage dialogue that informs everything best decisions. You are not only merely conveyors of information, you are agenda setters, influencers of public sentiment and advocates for justice. Your voices are essential to advancing health equity, dispelling myths and amplifying the resilience of those affected by HIV.\n\nTo date, Zimbabwe has 1.3 million Zimbabweans living with HIV and over 96% are accessing life-saving antiretroviral therapy.\n\nWe have reached the UNAs 95-95-95 targets ahead of schedule, a milestone reflecting our strong infrastructure, committed healthcare workers and effective multi-sector collaboration.\n\nThe countrys gains on HIV remain fragile, according to Mombeshora.\n\nOur gains remain fragile. Between January and June this year, Zimbabwe recorded 5,932 AIDS-related deaths compared to 5,712 in the same period in 2024, an increase of 220 deaths. Reminding us, our work is still not done.\n\nThis rise is not due to partial withdrawal of partner support. By the time key partners like the US government withdrew some funding, our institutions had adequate ARR fees and supplies.\n\nThe minister highlighted that Zimbabwes systems had shown resilience and continued to monitor closely to ensure uninterrupted treatment.\n\nThe government has mobilised domestic resources through SIM taxes on alcohol, tobacco, sugar drinks at the AIDS level to protect ARR fees, stockpiles and maintain service continuity.\n\nThe Finance Ministry is reinforcing but in allocations, while we engage strategic partners to close funding gaps.\n\nWe must, however, be candid. The transition to full domestic financing introduces complex challenges, said the Minister.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC Sport\n\nKirsty Coventry, the new president of the International Olympic Committee, says its members have shown overwhelming support to protecting the female category in sport.\n\nIn a significant shift in policy, she said the IOC must play a leading role in discussions on gender eligibility.\n\nAt her first news conference since taking over the role earlier this week, the Zimbabwean revealed a working group on the issue made up of experts and international federations would ensure that we find consensus.\n\nThe IOC has previously left gender regulations to the governing bodies of individual sports rather than applying a universal approach.\n\nBut having become the first woman to hold the IOC presidency, 41 year-old Coventry said its members now wanted to develop a policy to come up with cohesion.\n\nHowever, Coventry also hinted that no retrospective action would be taken over the controversial boxing tournament at last years Paris Olympics, when the IOCs handling of gender rules came under intense scrutiny.\n\nFollowing a first meeting of her executive board, Coventry added, We understand that therell be differences depending on the sport but it was very clear from the members that we have to protect the female category, first and foremost to ensure fairness.\n\nBut we need to do that with a scientific approach and the inclusion of the international federations who have already done a lot of work in this area.\n\nDuring her election campaign, former swimmer Coventry  a seven-time Olympic medalist  pledged to introduce a blanket ban on transgender women competing in female Olympic competition.\n\nIn recent years a growing number of sports federations have barred athletes who have undergone male puberty from competing in elite female competition amid concerns over fairness and safety.\n\nHowever, in other sports, transgender women are still able to compete in womens events at the Olympics.\n\nThe IOC was engulfed in controversy at the Paris Games last summer when Algerias Imane Khelif won the womens welterweight boxing gold medal  a year after being disqualified from the World Championships for reportedly failing a gender eligibility test.\n\nThe IOC cleared the 25-year-old to compete  along with Taiwans Lin Yu-ting  who was also banned by the suspended International Boxing Association (IBA). The IOC said competitors were eligible for the womens division if their passports said they were female.\n\nBoth fighters insist they are women, have always competed in the womens division, and there is no suggestion they are transgender.\n\nSome reports took the IBA stating that Khelif has XY chromosomes to speculate that the fighter might have differences of sexual development (DSD), like runner Caster Semenya. However, the BBC has not been able to confirm whether this is or is not the case.\n\nLast year, the World Boxing Organisation (WBO) said reports it had stripped Khelif of the Paris gold medal for failing gender eligibility tests were obviously false.\n\nWhen asked if her working group could apply any retrospective action, Coventry said, Were not going to be doing anything retrospectively. Were going to be looking forward. From the members [it] was what are we learning from the past, and how are we going to leverage that and move that forward to the future?'\n\nEarlier this month, World Boxing said mandatory sex testing would be introduced in July to ensure the safety of all participants and deliver a competitive level playing field for men and women. It followsWorld Athletics which has also approved the introduction of a swab testto determine if an athlete is biologically female.\n\nWhen asked if she endorsed such a policy, and if the IOC could also adopt it, Coventry said, Its too early to pre-empt the medical experts.\n\nIt was very clear from the membership the discussion around this has to be done with medical and scientific research at the core, so we are looking at the facts and the nuances and the inclusion of the international federations that have done so much of this workhaving a seat at table and sharing with us because every sport is different.\n\nBut it was pretty much unanimously felt that the IOC should take a leading role in bringing everyone together to try and find a broad consensus.\n\nIn February, the president of the International Paralympic Committee told BBC Sport thathe is opposed to blanket solutionsfor transgender participation policies.\n\nAndrew Parsons was speaking after United States president Donald Trump signed an executive order that prevents transgender women from competing in female categories of sports. He said he would deny visas to transgender athletes seeking to compete in female categories at the Los Angeles Olympic Games in 2028.\n\nCoventry said the IOC also planned to set up a second working group looking at when Olympic host cities should be named.\n\n",
