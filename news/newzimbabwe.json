Lungelo Ndhlovu/Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nAround Hwange, last years drought dried up the boreholes and waterholes, threatening wildlife in the park and depriving people in Mabale of drinking water.\n\nAnd although rainfall from December to February this year was normal or above, fallout from the last drought persists.\n\nDespite this years rains, we had to close one of our boreholes, Mudima said, explaining how water table levels were still very low.\n\nBecause there are too many people in my village and not enough boreholes, people walk 5 km to a neighbouring village with a solar borehole, she said, referring to a borehole pumped by solar power.\n\nFaced with these recurrent water crises, people in Hwange have started building rainwater tanks, helped by the Soft Foot Alliance, a community-based trust registered in Zimbabwe.\n\nConstance Ndaba, 75, who lives in Masikili Village 2, said the tank harvesting system saves her walking 2 km to the next village.\n\nFor a family of seven, drinking water from the rainwater tank lasts us up to three months. Im not sure when I last went to fetch water from a borehole.\n\nConstance Ndaba poses next to a giant rainwater harvesting jar at her home in Masikili Village 2. The jar helps her family cope with water shortages when nearby boreholes and rivers run dry. 7 May 2025. Lungelo Ndhlovu/Thomson Reuters Foundation\n\nRainwater is collected in giant jars made by moulding canvas and chicken wire around sand. A thin cement plaster fixes the form, then the inside is plastered. The jars are placed near house walls to collect run-off from the roof.\n\nTheir simplicity makes for an easy upkeep  a key benefit in remote communities.\n\nWe use chicken wire, plain wire, four bags of cement and 24 buckets of river sand which is locally available. To build the jar tank takes four days and it can collect up to five drums of water, which can last up to three months, said Austin Nkomo, one of the builders of jar tanks based in Hwange.\n\nMsungwe Sithole, a creative facilitator at the Soft Foot Alliance, said the project aimed to build resilience to drought and help people live sustainably in a depleted landscape.\n\nErratic rains are not the only reason for water scarcity, said Chipo Mpofu-Zuze, manager for the Environmental Management Agency in the Matabeleland North province.\n\nMpofu-Zuze said deforestation, crop-growing along streams, poor farming methods, alien species invading wetlands and the release of effluent into local waters were also responsible.\n\nSimba Guzha, regional project manager with Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) Zimbabwe, trains farmers to adapt to the increasingly hot and dry conditions.\n\nVSO is working with smallholders in the eastern provinces to improve productivity while safeguarding the environment  helping them stay safe from any shock drops in aid.\n\nMost of the farmers who have been trained on infiltration pits, earth dams, and rooftop water harvesting systems are now using these systems even without any foreign support, he said.\n\n",

This verse encapsulates the essence of pursuing a relationship with Jesus Christ, the ultimate source of hope and strength.The story of Zacchaeus in Luke 19:1-10 serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of our efforts to seek Christ. Zacchaeus, a tax collector, was determined to see Jesus, even climbing a sycamore tree to catch a glimpse of Him.Interestingly, despite his efforts, it was not Zacchaeus who found Jesus first; rather, Jesus saw him. This teaches us that even our smallest attempts to seek Christ matter.When Jesus called out to Zacchaeus, saying, Hurry and come down! For I must stay at your house today, He demonstrated that He is always ready to respond to our desires for connection. Jesus sees us before we see Him, and He invites us into a relationship that transforms our lives.Jesus invites us to try me and see if I dont find favour in you. This call to test His goodness is echoed in Malachi 3:10, where we are encouraged to bring our whole selves to Him.When we seek the face of Christ, we open ourselves to the possibility of His grace and favour, enabling us to confront our challenges with renewed strength.As we invite Christ into our lives, He establishes a permanent relationship with us. This relationship empowers us to conquer our difficulties and stand firm against the adversities we face.When we put our minds and faith in Christ, we are reminded that we are not alone.

May our lives reflect Your love and grace, and may we be filled with the hope of being called Your children when You return.Remove all the tribulations and pains we find ourselves in today. Restore peace and make us rejoin all our families in love and harmony once again.In Jesus name, we pray.AMEN.\n\nInterestingly, despite his efforts, it was not Zacchaeus who found Jesus first; rather, Jesus saw him. This teaches us that even our smallest attempts to seek Christ matter.\n\nWhen Jesus called out to Zacchaeus, saying, Hurry and come down! For I must stay at your house today, He demonstrated that He is always ready to respond to our desires for connection. Jesus sees us before we see Him, and He invites us into a relationship that transforms our lives.Jesus invites us to try me and see if I dont find favour in you. This call to test His goodness is echoed in Malachi 3:10, where we are encouraged to bring our whole selves to Him.When we seek the face of Christ, we open ourselves to the possibility of His grace and favour, enabling us to confront our challenges with renewed strength.As we invite Christ into our lives, He establishes a permanent relationship with us. This relationship empowers us to conquer our difficulties and stand firm against the adversities we face.When we put our minds and faith in Christ, we are reminded that we are not alone. He walks with us, guiding and supporting us through every trial.The call to seek the word of the cross is a call to embrace a relationship with Jesus Christ. Like Zacchaeus, let us not be discouraged by our limitations but instead be encouraged by the knowledge that every effort we make to seek Him is met with His love and grace.As we draw closer to Him, we prepare ourselves to be called children of God when He returns. Let us seek the face of Christ, for in doing so, we find our true strength and purpose.PRAYERHeavenly Father,We come before You with humble hearts, seeking Your presence and the transformative power of the cross.Thank You for the gift of Your Son, Jesus Christ, who invites us to draw near to Him. We acknowledge that in the midst of our challenges, it is easy to lose sight of You, but we desire to seek Your face with all our hearts.Lord, just as Zacchaeus climbed the sycamore tree in his pursuit of You, grant us the courage to climb beyond our fears and doubts. Help us to reach for You, knowing that even our smallest efforts are seen by You. We trust that You are always looking out for us and that Your love is eager to embrace us.As we navigate the trials of life, may we find strength in Your Word and comfort in Your promises. Teach us to rely on You, and let our faith be unwavering. Help us to recognize the influence of darkness around us and empower us to stand firm in Your light.Lord, we ask that You come into our homes and hearts, establishing a deep and lasting relationship with us.
