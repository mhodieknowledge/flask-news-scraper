            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nHarare magistrate Letwin Rwodzi has acquitted two Harare men Thabo Dube and Martin Charlie who were accused of raping socialite Ashley Masendeke better known as Mai Jeremaya.\n\nThe magistrate said the Statescasewas too weak for a reasonable court to convict.\n\nFrom a clear analysis, the complainants evidence is unsatisfactory.\n\nI conclude so because in the present case, both accused gave their own explanation, which was not rebutted by the state.\n\nInconsistencies fly in the face of the complainants evidence.\n\nOn the other hand, the accused have remained consistent that the encounter was consensual.\n\nThe complainant gave three different and inconsistent statements to the police. She told the court that she was told to change her statement by one of the police but the state did not call that police officer to testify, said the magistrate.\n\nThe magistrate said this conduct is inconsistent with someone pursuing justice.\n\nThe magistrate said there are many questions which remain unanswered regarding Mai Jeremayas allegations.\n\nShe said her testimony gives credibility to the accuseds defence that the sex was consensual and transactional.\n\nThe sequence of events clearly demonstrates that the complainants report to the police was not a complete voluntary decision, said the magistrate.\n\nShe said Mai Jeremaya told her friend, Cynthia, it was a secret, which might mean that she intended to keep it under wraps.\n\nThe complainant had no option other than to cry rape, following a confrontation with her friend.\n\nThe magistrate added that Mai Jeremaya also violated the accused by hiring a private investigator who terrorised them.\n\nThe magistrate said given all that happened leading to the accuseds arrest, it was clear that the socialite fabricated the rape.\n\nThe magistrate said, Evidence reveals an ulterior motive, either of extortion or to buy sympathy from her husband.\n\nRwodzi said failure by local PI Tafadzwa Chidawa to immediately surrender the accused to the police also shows that there was an ulterior motive.\n\nThe failure to report to the police and a pursuit for compensation after the alleged rape shows that the allegations were fabricated.\n\nThe function of the court is to do justice.\n\nIt is trite that if a litigant gives unsatisfactory evidence, their case is trashed.\n\nThe magistrate said the use of the money by the complainant shows that it was an agreed transaction.\n\nShe said there is credible evidence that Dube had a sexual encounter with Mai Jeremaya.\n\nThe totality of the evidence concludes that the sex with the second accused was consensual. He paid for the lodge, he paid for the transport and he gave the accused some money.\n\nThe magistrate took note of Mai Jeremayas allegation that the lodge was in a quiet place in trying to prove that she could not have screamed for help.\n\nShe said the video footage played in court showed that the lodge is a busy place.\n\nShe said this points out to the fact that the evidence was exaggerated.\n\nThe lodge manager also told the court that no one can access the lodge without paying first, which contradicts Mai Jeremayas testimony that the room had two doors and that Charlie used the other door to get into the room.\n\nThe magistrate also said Mai Jeremayas version of the sexual attack she gave to the police was different from that she gave in court.\n\nIn court she admitted that she was the one who went on top and guided the second accused into her vagina.\n\nAll of the above corroborate the accused version that the sex was not forced, said the magistrate.\n\nIn summary, the States case is riddled with inconsistencies.\n\nthe defence version has remained consistent. On the totality of the evidence, the complainant was a consenting part in the sexual encounter.\n\nIt clearly shows willingness to engage in sex for financial benefits. This supports the conclusion that there was an agreement for consensual sex.\n\nThe magistrate said Mai Jeremaya succumbed to domestic pressure.\n\nThe prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nRwodzi said it is true that Dube did not have sex with the socialite.\n\nI hereby find both the accused not guilty and acquitted of rape.\n\n",
