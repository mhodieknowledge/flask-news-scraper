            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nPOLITICAL analyst Rejoice Ngwenya has poured cold water on wealthy businessman Kuda Tagwireis chances of succeeding President Emmerson Mnangagwa, saying the tycoon-turned-politician lacks a political power base to challenge for the highest office.\n\nNgwenyas remarks follow widespread speculation President Emmerson Mnangagwas faction was preparing the businessman for takeover as president following resistance within the ruling party for the incumbent to run for a third successive term, which violates the countrys Constitution.\n\nThis is a simplistic, if not naive, narrative. Zanu PF has no succession strategy. They rely on populist gravitas, and I can tell you Tagwirei has no grassroots credibility.\n\nIt would be catastrophic for ED [Emmerson Mnangagwa] to present him as a 2028 candidate. And besides, who really likes ED in the Central Committee? Which provinces would vote for Tagwirei in that party? said Ngwenya.\n\nTagwirei has unsettled a faction pushing for President Mnangagwas deputy, Constantino Chiwenga, to takeover when the 82-year-old Zanu PF leader retires in 2028 upon expiry of his second and final presidential term as per constitutional limits.\n\nThere are three factions in Zanu PF: the ED faction, the Chiwenga faction, and the neutral, non-committal, unsure faction. Definitely, the Chiwenga faction will say nobut we know how powerful it is. If it can shift attitudes in the military, then it has the capacity to hold sway, said Ngwenya.\n\nTagwirei has, in recent times, emerged from nowhere, criss-crossing the country presiding over Zanu PF-organised events thereby fuelling speculation of his ambitions to succeed President Mnangagwa.\n\nTo demonstrate the tensions within Zanu PF, Tagwirei was reportedly ejected, at Chiwengas behest, from this weeks Zanu PF Central Committee meeting in Harare ostensibly for not having followed proper procedures to ratify his membership to the all-powerful Zanu PF organ. He was forced out alongside other new coopted members from other provinces, sources said.\n\nTagwirei arrived at the Central Committee gathering at Zanu PF Headquarters on Thursday with opulence and a spring in his step, only to fail to see the meeting through.\n\nThe businessman, who was endorsed by the Harare Province led by Goodwills Masimirembwa, attended the indaba unaware of the partys procedures and statutes.\n\nDespite his name having been seconded by the provincial structure, it required ratification by the Central Committee to confirm his co-option into the most powerful organ of Zanu PF.\n\nAccording to political observers, his attendance at the Central Committee meeting exposed his ignorance regarding the ruling partys procedures.\n\nTagwireis supersonic ascension in Zanu PF has been met with mixed feelings among the general membership.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nLAWYERS representing a Harare couple accused of grabbing a company from former Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor Gideon Gono have accused him of trying to extort the two of US$50,000 by abusing his closeness to corridors of power and threatening them with arrest.\n\nGono was in court as a key witness against Clark Clever Makoni and his wife Beverly Aisha Ndonda Makoni on Friday, accusing the two of fraudulently changing his company documents to elbow him out.\n\nThe State alleges that in July 2017, Gono engaged the services of the accused persons to manage Valley Lodge, among other properties.\n\nThe State also alleges that the couple forged a CR14 form for Valley Lodge [Pvt] ]Ltd] in which Clark Makoni appointed himself a director and company secretary and Beverly Makoni as a director in Valley Lodge.\n\nThis Friday Gono told the court that after the matter came out, Clark initiated a meeting and apologised before agreeing to pay the US$50,000 as compensation.\n\nHowever, he said, the deed of settlement did not materialise because Beverly was not present and she refused to sign the papers, adding that Clark never returned to him for the agreement to be consummated.\n\nGono conceded that the deed of Settlement had to be signed by three parties for it to be legally valid.\n\nThis is after the couple denied entering into an agreement with him.\n\nAdmire Rubaya representing the couple took the banker to task for signing documents which described Clark as the Managing Director and Beverly as the Finance Director yet the State alleges they gave themselves the positions after altering the company documents.\n\nThis came after Gono was shown the alleged agreement which he signed showing the two as the managing and finance director including the said minutes of the meeting.\n\nThe deed of settlement stated that Gono was to instruct his people to withdraw the cases when the agreement is signed and that he would not have been in court.\n\nThe couple, through their lawyers, questioned why Gono was prepared to withdraw the charges if indeed they had stolen from him which the couple believes was an extortion attempt.\n\nIt emerged that Clark Makoni was arrested and detained twice by the ZRP and ZACC over the same allegations and the couples lawyer averred that was stark evidence that Gono abused his power to mistreat them as that was his culture to illtreat those close to him after using them.\n\nThe couple said Gono had used the same approach on one Ralph Muzembe who was his best man at his wedding.\n\nMuzembe, who previously was the one managing the Valley Lodge business, was reportedly Gonos right hand man who was unceremoniously discarded through the Makonis on Gonos instructions.\n\nGono also said he had no expert evidence to state that the couple signed documents which were presented to Mutare ZB Bank.\n\nIt has also emerged that Gono is neither a shareholder of Valley Lodge [Pvt] nor a director of same since he has not yet paid the full purchase price for the lodge and no formalities for change of ownership had taken place from the Omar brothers.\n\nGono told the court that the allege meetings which culminated into the deed of settlement had allegedly been recorded on audio and video. However, Gono did not have such evidence in place to corroborate his story that Clark had signed the alleged documents.\n\nThe matter continues on July 11.\n\n",
