            "content": "Aleem Maqbool l BBC Religion Editor\n\nA LONDON-born boy has become the first millennial saint, in a ceremony steeped in an ancient ritual presided over by Pope Leo on Sunday.\n\nIn his short life, Carlo Acutis created websites documenting miracles as a means of spreading Catholic teaching, leading some to nickname him Gods influencer.His canonisation had been due in late April, but was postponed following the death of Pope Francis.More than a million people are estimated to have made a pilgrimage to the Italian hilltop town of Assisi where Carlos body lies, preserved in wax.But there is another pilgrimage site associated with Carlo Acutis that has seen an increase in visitors since it was announced that he was to be made a saint  Our Lady of Dolours Church in London.The font at the back of the Roman Catholic church in the Chelsea area was where Carlo was baptised as a baby in 1991.To the side of the church an old confession booth has been converted into a shrine to him. In it, a relic holder contains a single strand of Carlos hair.His family were in finance and they were working really temporarily in London, says Father Paul Addison, a friar at the church.Although they didnt use the church much, they decided to come and ask to have the child baptised. So Carlo was a flash, a very big flash, in the life of the parish community, he says.Carlo was not yet six months old when his parents moved back to their home country of Italy, and he spent the rest of his life in Milan.There, he was known for a love of technology and is said to have enjoyed playing video games.While some who knew Carlo Acutis say he did not appear to be especially devout, as a teenager he did create a website  pages of which are now framed at the church in Chelsea  in which miracles were documented.Pages of Carlos website are now framed at Our Lady of Dolours Church in ChelseaBut he died of leukaemia aged just 15.In the years after his death, Carlos mother, Antonia Salzano, visited churches around the world to advocate for him to be a saint.As part of the process, it had to be proved her son had performed miracles.The first miracle, he did the day of the funeral, says Carlos mother.A woman with breast cancer prayed (for) Carlo and she had to start chemotherapy and the cancer disappeared completely, she explains.Pope Francis attributed two miracles to Carlo Acutis and so the test was passed and he was due to be made a saint on 27 April.But Pope Francis died during the preceding week.Some followers who had travelled to Rome for the canonisation instead found themselves among the tens of thousands of mourners at the late pontiffs funeral  Diego Sarkissian, a young Catholic from London, was one of them.He says he feels a connection to Carlo Acutis and is excited by his canonisation.He used to play Super Mario video games on the old Nintendo consoles and Ive always loved video games, Mr Sarkissian says.The fact that you can think of a saint doing the same things [as you], wearing jeans, it feels so much closer than what other saints have felt like in the past, he says.Approval for someone to become a saint can take decades or even centuries, but there is a sense that the Vatican fast-tracked Carlo Acutis canonisation as a means of energising and inspiring faith in young people.\n\nIn his short life, Carlo Acutis created websites documenting miracles as a means of spreading Catholic teaching, leading some to nickname him Gods influencer.\n\nHis canonisation had been due in late April, but was postponed following the death of Pope Francis.More than a million people are estimated to have made a pilgrimage to the Italian hilltop town of Assisi where Carlos body lies, preserved in wax.But there is another pilgrimage site associated with Carlo Acutis that has seen an increase in visitors since it was announced that he was to be made a saint  Our Lady of Dolours Church in London.The font at the back of the Roman Catholic church in the Chelsea area was where Carlo was baptised as a baby in 1991.To the side of the church an old confession booth has been converted into a shrine to him.

These reviews are guided by the need to improve the welfare of educators while maintaining fiscal sustainability, he said.\n\nIn addition to salary adjustment, Moyo said the government has introduced several non-monetary incentives including provision of land for housing development, duty-free vehicle importation facility, access to the Government Employees Mutual Savings (GEMS) scheme and ongoing efforts to expand institutional accommodation.\n\nThe ministry continues to engage with relevant stakeholders to explore more innovative ways of cushioning teachers from economic pressures including school-based incentives supported through local communities and responsible authorities, he added.\n\nZimbabwe is one of the few countries, which does not meaningfully reward its teachers and civil servants.\n\nA June 2021 report stated that, comparing with other regional countries, Zimbabwean teachers got way below their peers. In Namibia, tutors earned 24,000 Namibian dollars per month, equivalent to about US$1,759 at that time. In Botswana, teachers salaries range from 5,970 to 22,700 Botswana Pula per month while Lesothos average salary in 2024 was around 11,800 Lesotho Loti (LSL) per month, or about $792.\n\n",
