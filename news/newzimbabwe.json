            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nOpposition lawmaker for Glenview South, Happymore Chidziva who was accused of raping his wifes 16 year old relative has been acquitted.\n\nChidziva, also known as Bvondo, was accused of sexually abusing the minor on three occasions, twice at a local hotel and at a lodge in Waterfalls.\n\nProsecutors alleged that the legislator sweet-talked the girl into believing that he would secure employment for her before raping her.\n\nAt one time, heallegedly told the girl that he would secure employment for her abroad and change her life.\n\nHowever, Harare Magistrate Letwin Rwodzi cleared Chidziva of wrongdoing after a full trial, ruling that the prosecution failed to prove its case.\n\nThe magistrate also said the state failed to prove that Chidziva ever tried to secure employment for the minor.\n\nThe NPA was alleging that sometime in April 2024, Chidziva called the complainant and asked her to meet at Zanu PF Headquarters traffic lights, where he picked her up.\n\nIt was alleged that the MP told the girl that his car had broken down and drove her to a hotel in Harare CBD, where he asked her for sex.\n\nThe girl allegedly refused and told Chidziva that she was not ready.\n\nThe state alleged that Chidziva however took the girl to a room where he raped her without protection before giving her US$25.\n\nThe prosecution said after the alleged rape, the MP hired a taxi before he disembarked at a service station along Willowvale Road while the complainant proceeded to Glen View.\n\nThe following morning the accused person sent a message instructing her to buy some morning-after pills with the money he gave her, and her cousin was holding her phone and she saw the message, the MPs trial was told.\n\nThe complainant then told her cousin that she slept with the accused person and he was telling her to buy morning-after pills.\n\nIt was alleged that sometime in July 2024, the complainant told her aunt that Chidziva had found a job for her in Marimba as a domestic worker.\n\nOn that same day, it was alleged that Chidziva took the girl to a guesthouse in Waterfalls where he raped heragain.\n\nAfter the abuse, the teen did not return home but went to stay in Ushewokunze with her friend and her parents.\n\nIt was further alleged that on August 9, 2024, around 5PM, the MP called the teenager whilst she was in town and asked her to meet him at Cresta Lodge in Masasa.\n\nThe complainant then hired a taxi to Cresta Lodge, where she met the accused person. They then went into a room and the accused person then went out and returned at around midnight.\n\nThe accused person asked her to have sexual intercourse with him, and she refused and told him that she was tired.\n\nProsecutors alleged Chidziva then pleaded with the teen, promising her a job outside Zimbabwe and she complied.\n\nThe 16-year-old then returned to Ushewokunze, where she was chased away by her friends mother because she had not slept at home the previous night.\n\nThe court heard that she then went and stayed with her cousin in Budiriro 1, but her aunt had already filed a missing persons report at Budiriro Police Station.\n\nShe later presented herself to the police, where she narrated her ordeal leading to Chidzivas arrest.\n\n",

Mudenda said.\n\n",

ZLHR further argues that the impugned provisions of the PVO Amendment Act were vague and badly drafted and contained arbitrary powers and over-regulation of PVOs, said ZLHR.\n\nZLHR also said the PVO Amendment Act has the effect of concentrating arbitrary powers in the Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare and the Registrars office and contains excessive executive interference in the internal affairs of PVOs.\n\nIt said the impugned provisions of the PVO Amendment Act have the net effect of effectively allowing the Executive to run PVOs and to deregister those that authorities dislike on very nebulous grounds.\n\nTo this end ZLHR is seeking a High Court order of constitutional invalidity, declaring section 4, section 5 as read with section 9(5), section 6, section 13A, section 14, and section 21, of the Private Voluntary Organisations Act (as amended by the PVO Amendment Act) to be ultra vires the Constitution and to be set aside.\n\n",
