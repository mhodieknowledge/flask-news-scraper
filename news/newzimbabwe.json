            "content": "IOL\n\nActivist and grandson of Nelson Mandela, Mandla Mandela, who was sailing to Gaza aboard a boat which is part of the Global Sumud Flotilla (GSF), has been kidnapped by Israeli forces who intercepted the flotilla in the early hours of Thursday.\n\nMandela prerecorded a message in case of interception by Israel.\n\nIm a citizen of the Republic of South Africa. If you are receiving this video, it means that we have been intercepted and have been abducted by the state of apartheid Israel, he said. I call you to request our government to exert pressure for my immediate release.\n\nThe South African group of the flotilla has condemned the interception of its vessels by Israeli occupation forces in international waters, describing the attack as a deliberate attempt to block humanitarian aid to Gaza.\n\nDelegates aboard the flotilla, which included South African civilians, were reportedly detained and faced drone and water cannon attacks.\n\nIn a statement, the Global Sumud Flotilla (GDF) confirmed that the Israeli occupation forces ambushed the Global Sumud Flotilla in international waters, detaining some of the delegates and attacking the vessels with drones and water cannons.\n\nThese actions represent yet another attempt to silence voices of solidarity and to prevent even the smallest lifeline of relief from reaching Gaza. This is illegal under international law, the GDF said in a statement.\n\nThe organisation emphasised that the flotillas mission was purely humanitarian and peaceful.\n\nThe GSF was carrying civilians committed to drawing attention to the devastating conditions faced by Palestinians. Their mission is peaceful. Their objective is humanitarian. Their interception exposes once more the reality that Gaza is held under siege not only by walls and checkpoints, but by warships, drones, and policies of isolation.\n\nThe GSF called on the South African government to act immediately to ensure the safe return of its citizens.\n\nThe Global Sumud Flotilla  RSA demands the immediate and unconditional release of all the delegates with full access to their lawyers, and for Israel to respect all international laws and measures governing the protection of civilians and humanitarian missions, the unhindered delivery of the humanitarian aid, and the lifting of the siege that continues to strangle Gaza, they said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Chrispin Phiri, spokesperson for the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco), emphasised South Africas call for restraint and adherence to international law.\n\nSouth Africa wishes to reiterate, in the strongest terms, its call for all actors to adhere strictly to international law, including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and relevant international humanitarian law principles, he said.\n\nPhiri stressed that the safety and security of the flotillas participants, includingSouth African citizens, are of paramount importance.\n\nThe safety, security, and physical integrity of all unarmed participants aboard the Flotilla, including South African citizens, are of paramount importance, he added.\n\nHe warned that any military engagement or forceful detention of the vessels in international waters would constitute a serious breach of international norms. Phirifurther highlighted the peaceful and humanitarian mission of theflotilla.\n\nIt must be underscored that the Flotilla is a civilian-led initiative, embarked upon a peaceful and humanitarian mission. Its participants aim to draw attention to the severe and urgent humanitarian needs of the Palestinian people in Gaza and to deliver vital aid to alleviate the widespread suffering, Phiri said.\n\nOther South Africans who are part of the mission include Fatima Hendricks, Zaheera Soomar, Zukisa Wanner, Reaaz Moola, Bashera Soomar and Carolyn Shelver.\n\nFormer Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) MP Mbuyiseni Ndlozi shared his support of Mandela. \n\nMandla Mandela! Selfless brave soul. You make us eternally proud Madiba. Strength to the Sumud Flotilla, Free Palestine, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "Xinhua\n\nLinda Hungwe, a 52-year-old farmer from Masvingo Province in southeastern Zimbabwe, believes that the key to maintaining food security is to adopt indigenous seed varieties that are well-adapted to the local environment.\n\nSeed symbolizes the beginning of life, and when I control the choice of the seed I grow, I take charge of my destiny, Hungwe told Xinhua during the National Good Seed and Food Festival recently held in Harare, the countrys capital, an annual event to promote indigenous seeds, traditional foods, and sustainable agricultural practices.\n\nDuring the festival, Hungwe and other farmers showcased various indigenous seeds, exchanged seeds, and shared knowledge on Zimbabwes culinary culture.\n\nThe farmer said she grows indigenous crops such as pearl millet, finger millet, round nuts, and cowpeas, which are more drought-tolerant, better adapted to local soil, and more resilient to pests.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, recurrent droughts have diminished crop yields for farmers dependent on rain-fed agriculture, prompting them to adopt drought-tolerant indigenous crops.\n\nFarmer-led seed systems are important because, as a farmer, I know the qualities of the seed, my soil, its shortcomings and needs, she said, adding that indigenous seeds can be grown organically, which reduces reliance on expensive external inputs such as fertilizers and pesticides.\n\nChristopher Chinyoka, another farmer from Masvingo Province, said seed exchange among farmers is a long-standing tradition that ensures food security by maintaining locally adapted crops.\n\nSeed exchanges have been carried on from our ancestors; its a culture that creates a bond between people. We had seeds that had gone extinct, but now they have been revived, thanks to seed exchanges. If my crop fails due to drought or other reasons, I can always get the seed from other farmers, he said.\n\nA farmer shows her agricultural products at a seed and food festival in Harare, Zimbabwe, Sept. 20, 2025.(Xinhua/Tafara Mugwara)\n\nChinyoka added that smallholder farmers should not be at the periphery of food production, but rather be at the forefront to effectively safeguard food security.\n\nArchbold Sasa, a lecturer in the Department of Crop Science at the Marondera University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology in Zimbabwe, said smallholder farmers are key to promoting food security and resilience.\n\nSmallholder farmers play a crucial role in storing some seed varieties because they keep producing them from time to time, so that we dont lose that genetic material as a country. Its sort of a seed bank, he said. Some crops are being neglected, and people are not producing them anymore, but we tend to find those seeds in smallholder farmers.\n\nIn addition to indigenous grains, farmers are encouraged to adopt indigenous vegetables, including blackjack, pigweed, okra, and pumpkin leaves, due to their high nutritional value and adaptation to local climates.\n\nWe are doing seed exchange from one district to another so that people will have a diversity of these indigenous vegetables to promote their nutrition, resulting in improved health, said Sasa.\n\n",
