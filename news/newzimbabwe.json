            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE African Sovereign Investors Forum (ASIF) has officially endorsed the Mutapa Investment Fund (MIF) as its newest member.This recognition marks a significant milestone for the Zimbabwean sovereign wealth fund, formerly known as the Sovereign Wealth Fund of Zimbabwe, which was rebranded following the re-election of President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa in 2023.MIF, led by chief executive officer John Mangudya, is a state-owned investment fund established under Zimbabwes Sovereign Wealth Fund Act (Chapter 22:20). It is primarily funded through a mix of fiscal surpluses, resource earnings, privatisation proceeds, and official foreign currency operations. The fund was renamed via Statutory Instrument 156 of 2023 in line with the countrys broader economic objectives.The recent endorsement by ASIF signals a step forward in enhancing MIFs ability to engage with strategic partners across the continent. The announcement came during ASIFs 2025 meeting, where the organisation welcomed new members, including Ghanas Petroleum Fund. The new additions bring ASIFs total membership to 17 sovereign wealth funds from across Africa.A key highlight from the meeting was the creation of three working groups focused on agricultural development, climate finance, and data infrastructure. These groups are expected to collaborate on impactful projects that align with ASIFs broader mission of supporting Africas sustainable development and wealth transfer to future generations.The ASIF Council will reconvene later in 2025 to review progress and discuss future investment strategies.Launched in June 2022, ASIF started with 10 founding members and has since grown to include 15 sovereign wealth funds. Its aim is to foster cross-border collaboration between African nations to pool resources and expertise, driving larger and more impactful investments for the continents growth.This development highlights a growing trend of African sovereign wealth funds working together to accelerate the continents economic progress, with MIF now joining an influential network of investors.\n\nTHE African Sovereign Investors Forum (ASIF) has officially endorsed the Mutapa Investment Fund (MIF) as its newest member.\n\nThis recognition marks a significant milestone for the Zimbabwean sovereign wealth fund, formerly known as the Sovereign Wealth Fund of Zimbabwe, which was rebranded following the re-election of President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa in 2023.MIF, led by chief executive officer John Mangudya, is a state-owned investment fund established under Zimbabwes Sovereign Wealth Fund Act (Chapter 22:20).

The English jargon used in law is often confusing hence the urgent need to roll it out in local languages.So far we appreciate the role being played by community based publications in conscientising the Mberengwa local residents, he said.Mashavakure urged stakeholders and Parliament to work expeditiously and pave the way for the finalisation of the Bill as soon as possible as a strategy to stop the current rampant environmental damage before it goes offhand.Merengwa Ward 16 Councillor, Lovemore Nkomo expressed gratitude over the clauses in the Bill saying it has the potential to address the bulk of problems bedeviling the mining sector.He said the neo-colonial agenda contained in the 1961 Mines and Minerals Act could be a thing of the past once the Bill sails through. He underscored that the document needs to be circulated in local languages way on time ahead of public hearings.Alder Makotore, an Environmental Sub Committee member in the same district implored Parly to urgently insert issues that affect women in mining communities such as destruction of water sources, eradicating sexual harassment, which are not so prominent in Bill.She said mechanisms which guaranteed womens participation during the forthcoming public hearings exercises must be put in place.Silveira House project manager for community-led mining advocacy and governance, Zandile Mvududu said while the Bill presents opportunities to address legacy problems in the mining sector, the Portfolio Committee on Mines must be geared to receive overwhelming feedback from residents.With the Environmental Social Governance (ESG) focus in most mining communities which have been influenced by the efforts to minimise the ESG risks, we feel that the Bill has gained so much momentum in the communities, she said.\n\nThe Bill, which has gone through several twists and turns since 2015, is seen as a signal marking the departure from the archaic colonial legislation last promulgated in 1961, leaving gaps which the mining companies have taken advantage of over the years.\n\nThe document was gazetted in June 2025 under General Notice 1243A of 2025 by Clerk of Parliament, Kennedy Chokuda, in terms of Standing Order No.142 (1) of the National Assembly.Speaking during the Silveira House organised district environmental impact assessment dialogue this week, Mberengwa Ward 10 Councillor, Devilious Mashavakure called on Parliament to set out its systems for widespread circulation.Parliament must strive to overcome the language barriers in communities hardest hit by mining activities.

Therefore, we are looking forward to having more doctors in 2029 to 2030 to service these rural hospitals, said Kwidini.\n\nThis has left citizens in rural areas in a quandary, forcing them to walk long distances to access medical services.\n\nKwidini said this is a result of a lack of accommodation facilities at some rural clinics.\n\nIt is true that we need doctors in rural hospitals so that elderly people do not have to travel long distances to see doctors. We have a challenge with the doctors houses in district hospitals. This is the challenge that we are facing, which then results in elderly people failing to find those doctors in rural hospitals.\n\nThere is no accommodation for these doctors, but as soon as we put in place accommodation, they will be found nearer to them. For us to put doctors in clinics, it is difficult because the patient ratio is not enough, he said.\n\nThe countrys health system is in dire straits, leaving the majority to rely on private facilities, with the poor left to contend with the public hospitals.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has pledged to address the situation at public hospitals, with a section of Parirenyatwa Hospital undergoing renovations.\n\n",
