Zambia, Ethiopia and Ghana have used the template, which has been criticized for being too slow.\n\nThe framework is being explored, according to the head of Zimbabwes Public Debt Management Office Andrew Bvumbe. We want to maximize the debt relief to the country, he said Wednesday by text message.\n\nIt has appealed to 10 nations to assist in raising$2.6 billionin bridge finance but is yet to receive any concrete commitments.\n\nSouth Africa has not been approached to consider providing bridge finance to Zimbabwe, the National Treasury said.\n\nAfricas largest economy is owed $24 million by its neighbor, according to data provided by the Zimbabwean Treasury.\n\n",

We feel that this is a strategy by the employer to endlessly buy time while we are working as their slaves for free. Its cruel.\n\nBut in principle, non-academics and academics are on the same page, there is no going back.\n\nThey have resolved to join AUT in the industrial job action. There is no going back, he said.\n\nStudents also said they are worried that the situation has remained unresolved for a long time.\n\nZinasu spokesperson for UZ Chapter, Darlington Chigwena, said their future has already been compromised as the review of UZ qualifications has gone down.\n\nHe said students will fight in the corner of their lecturers because they are excessively affected.\n\nThe return of our lecturers means that we are going to have credible and quality education.\n\nWe are together with lecturers, we are working hand in glove.\n\nAlso, as students, we are not only showing substantial solidarity to the lecturers because we are aware that if they are treated in a proper manner, it means that we are going to excel as students.\n\nWe are also aware that as students we are workers in transit so if the rights are being respected it means that our rights as future workers are also going to be respected so the picket which is going to happen on Monday, we are going to partake, we are goi g to participate as students, we are going to be there as many as the sand of the sea showing our solidarity with them making sure that justice prevails both for the lecturers and the students, he said.\n\nThe next picketing will be held on Monday.\n\n",

            "content": "The rise in demand for lithium to meet the production of batteries for electric cars and batteries for household solar use has come with a myriad problems. A number of lithium mines are located in Zimbabwes communal areas. The Mandihongola mine in Gwanda, the Sandawana lithium mine in Mberengwa district and the Arcadia lithium mine in Goromonzi district are all located in communal areas.\n\nThe president has the power to expropriate any land for extractive activities in terms of section 324 of the present Mines and Minerals Act. Applying this law to the present lithium deposits classified as critical minerals is rather complicated because the state has transferred exclusive rights to Chinese-owned companies to mine critical minerals.\n\nIn some cases, the lithium rock in Gwanda district is also found in nearby settlements in communal areas such as Garanyemba. Five to eight generations of people have lived in these communal rural areas and their future is at risk. There is a high possibility that already scarce water and grazing will be under threat from the lithium mining activities.\n\nA number of indigenous rights holders are deprived of scarce grazing land to accommodate mining interests and there is zero or inadequate compensation for those who reside on this land.\n\nIn a clash of interests, international human rights law comes into the picture despite there being no explicit meaning of the right to land in international law. Rural district councils do have the power to manage the use of land and powers seemingly overriding the traditional chiefs and headmens powers over the land. It is unclear what role the Rural District Council plays in stopping any activities that might, in the long run, overstep the rights of indigenous people.\n\nThe state, through its agencies such as the Ministry of Mines and the Environmental Management Agency has not been clear on the negative effects of lithium mining.\n\nSeeing that communities are not benefiting from anything save for the manual jobs whose salaries only meet the bare minimum of peoples needs, it is important that grazing and water interests are clearly protected\n\nA balance needs to be struck between mining companies seeking rights to extract minerals and indigenous people on whose land the minerals are found.\n\nCommunities such as those of Mandihongola are raising concerns regarding mining on their land. The Chinese mining company undertaking activities of lithium extraction and processing, which is reported to be about 1000 tonnes a day, is using the scarce water sources and emitting the lithium processing residue into the dam from which the cattle drink. In a community where livestock are a source of livelihood and wealth, no balance of interests has been taken into account.\n\nThere are no official statements from the Environmental Management Agency that inspections of these lithium mines have been done to ensure communities grazing and water rights are protected. Neither have there been official statements by the minister of environment, climate and tourism.\n\nThe worrying silence on the relevant players in government is a deep concern as to whether the interests of the villagers are being taken into account. Perhaps only when disaster strikes will the relevant ministries and other state agencies take such concerns seriously.\n\nThe nation is battling with land degradation and water pollution from mercury and cyanide caused by artisanal miners and bigger mining companies processing gold, which is polluting water sources. Some streams and rivers feed dams that supply water for use by urban councils.\n\nLegislation is in place for the penalties that mining companies face should they cause pollution to sources of water. For instance, section 57(1) of the Environmental Management Act imposes a fine of up to US$5000 or imprisonment not exceeding five years for any recklessness polluting water sources and damaging the environment. Rural communities do not have the capacity to stop mining companies from doing as they please\n\nFurthermore, there are no clear plans for the rehabilitation of lithium mines.\n\nWe cannot afford to sit back and turn a blind eye to any mining activities on communal land where the rights and livelihoods of people are trampled on.\n\nHoitsimolimo Mutlokwa is a post doctoral researcher at the Centre for Labour Law in the Faculty of Law at the University of the Free State.\n\n",
