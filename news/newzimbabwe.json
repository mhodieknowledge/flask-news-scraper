            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA TOP cement importer, Augutich Investments (PVT) LTD has taken Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube to court on allegations breaching the law by imposing tax on goods covered under the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) after it was taxed on its cement now stuck at Chirundu Border Post.\n\nUnder the COMESA Free Trade Area (FTA) goods originating from Member States can be imported and exported with reduced or eliminated tariffs.\n\nAugutich purchased 70 000 tonnes of cement from Zambia at a total cost of US$9,659 999, and it contends that the only tax obligation since this was a COMESA certificate was 15% value added tax (VAT), which would have been the sum of US$ 1,448-999.\n\nHowever, on May 22 2025 to its surprise the finance minister instructed ZIMRA to implement the new tax regime even on cement purchased prior to the promulgated date.\n\nThe effect of this cumulatively is that the company is saddled with a tax obligation over time in the sum of US$1,448 999 the 30% surtax on the already purchased cement.\n\nThe company said not only is this unreasonable it is legally untenable as laws must never be applied retrospectively.\n\nAugutich had 50 haulage trucks that were in the process of bringing cement into Zimbabwe of cement purchased prior to May 16, 2025, ZIMRA then changed its system and demanded the said surtax.\n\nThe trucks have been stuck at Chirundu Border post since May 22, 2025 with negotiations with ZIMRA officials having collapsed.\n\nZIMRA, according to court papers, said the minister is the responsible authority.\n\nTo this end Augutich Investments filed an urgent chamber application with the High Court seeking a temporary interdict suspending the enforcement of a surtax of 30 % against it on white cement whether artificially coloured, introduced by the Customs and Excise (Surtax Tariff) (Amendment) Notice, 2025 (No.6).\n\nThe company through its Chief Executive Officer Levy Mashingaidze, and represented by Mugiya Law Chambers, is also seeking an order that the implementation of surtax 30% duty should not apply to cement purchased by the applicant prior to May 16, 2025.\n\nOn the return date, the company prays for an order which strikes out the surtax on the basis that it is inconsistent and in violation of section 3 Customs and Excise (Common Market For Eastern And Southern Africa) (Suspension) Regulations, 2000 Le 5.1. 244 of 2000.\n\nThe surtax law was introduced on 16th of May 2025, the enforcement was then done on the 22 of May 2025.\n\nIn the year 2000, government caused the promulgation of Customs and Excise (Common Market For Eastern And Southern Africa) (Suspension) Regulations, 2000, which provide for the exemption of duty/surtax on goods imported and exported between member states of the COMESA also known as the COMESA regulations.\n\nWith the coming into effect of the COMESA regulations and with the passage of time, the applicant being an importer of white cement and other cement related products would over the years import cement from Zambia for purposes of resale in Zimbabwe.\n\nWith Zambia being a COMESA Member State, the company would import the cement duty in accordance with the COMESA regulations.\n\nThe company started importing cement sometime in 2020 and has been doing so for a period of five years with the last such import being done on a monthly basis, the last of which was in February 2025.\n\nThe company purchased 70,000 tonnes of cement in Zambia last year.\n\nIt eventually applied for an Import Licence from the Ministry of Industry snd Commerce to import the said cement into Zimbabwe.\n\nThere were several legal issues and the applicant litigated with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce this culminated in a settlement, the effect of which is that over a period of just over a year the applicant was issued with an Import Permit for Cement.\n\nThe Deed Of Settlement was signed by the parties on May 14, 2025.\n\nWhilst in the process of ensuring that the cement consignment which the applicant had purchased is transported into Zimbabwe, Ncube without notice to the stakeholders and the applicant, proceeded to issue Customs and Excise (Surtax Tariff) (Amendment) Notice, 2025 (No.6) through S1. 50A of 2025, whose effect was to introduce some surtax, Mashingaidze said in his founding affidavit accompanying the application.\n\nThere was now additional duty on cement, this was done without prior warning or a grace period by the minister.\n\nThe applicant is of the view that the requirement for it to pay 30% surtax on cement imported from the COMESA region is unlawful or inconsistent with the dictates of the section 3 of the COMESA regulations which clearly exempt the applicant from paying surtax.\n\nI must also advise the court that the importation of Cement is regulated by the Ministry Of Industry and Commerce through the issuance of Import Licences; this is obviously meant to protect the local industry and products from being overrun by imports.\n\nThe financial prejudice which applicant is suffering and continues to suffer is massive; the haulage trucks that were hired are now currently in transit .\n\nThe applicant has further shown that it contracted a different transporter to ship its cement from Zambia at a cost which is likely to blow out of its budget on account of demurrage,he said.\n\nThe matter is yet to be heard.\n\n",
