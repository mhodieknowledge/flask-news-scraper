            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nTHE Death Penalty Abolition Bill sailed through the Senate and now awaits President Emmerson Mnangagwas approval to become law.\n\nThe last execution in Zimbabwe was nearly two decades ago in 2005 and at the moment, Zimbabwe has over 60 prisoners on death row.\n\nMnangagwa has expressed he is against capital punishment, sharing his own experience when his death sentence for blowing up a train during the 1960s war was commuted to 10 years in prison.\n\nAfter a lengthy debate, the Bill was read for the second time with few amendments and finally read for the third time without any amendments before being passed.\n\nPrior to the Senates approval of the Bill, Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi warned Senate members about its sensitivity: I stand before this House to seek the abolition of the death penalty. The deliberation will be emotional.\n\nNot of this or that other human being but as part of human beings whose crimes are such of a heinous nature that our society is called to legislate that they must die if found guilty by the court of law, Ziyambi told the acting Senate President.\n\nHe added; Almost all cultures in Zimbabwe have marked out certain crimes to be deserving capital punishment. Our indigenous culture had less problems and messier than any foreign culture. The deserving of death has been perceived to be inhuman.\n\nCulturally and historically, before colonisers came to our country, we had no death penalty. In vernacular, we would say Mushonga wengozi kuiripa, kwete kuuraya.\n\nOur culture does not allow us to kill someone because they have murdered someone. In Shona we would say, Ngozi inoripwa. That is the point that I am trying to put across Mr. President.\n\nCan the death penalty actually deter crimes or not? Also, let us not forget that the death penalty is irreversible.\n\nSenator Tongogara called the death penalty, a landmark piece of legislation that seeks to fundamentally transform Zimbabwes criminal justice system.\n\nThis Bill, reflective of a growing global movement towards the abolition of capital punishment, demands our attention as legislators entrusted with the mandate to uphold justice, preserve human dignity and ensure that our legal framework aligns with the contemporary human rights standard.\n\nShe said, Globally, 112 countries had abolished the death penalty for all crimes and 142 were abolitionist in law or practice.\n\nBy joining this growing majority, Zimbabwe strengthens its position as a progressive nation committed to human rights and justice.\n\nIn Africa, Mozambique; Namibia; and South Africa abolished the death penalty long back whilst Rwanda, after the genocide abolished the death penalty in 2007.\n\nWhile some argue that the death penalty serves as a deterrent, research consistently challenges this assumption. The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) reports that there is no conclusive evidence linking the death penalty to reduced crime rates. Conversely, countries with abolitionist policies have often reported declines in violent crime.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the rate of brutal murders remains a significant concern. According to Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) statistics, 1642 murder cases were recorded in 2023,Tongogara said.\n\nShe urged Zimbabwe to follow President Mnangagwa, as a longstanding advocate for the abolition of capital punishment.\n\nHowever, Senator LindaSibanda differed,I rise with a heavy heart. Being a woman, a mother, a citizen and at the same time a Senator of this country who has got a cousin who is lying in the mortuary right now, whom we have been looking for, for about two weeks now, who was found dead at Fig Tree.\n\nHilary Muleya, who was murdered by a person who we do not know even up to today. I am here to serve my time in the Senate these coming two days and in three days, I will go and bury him.\n\nIt is so painful to just spare a murderer who does not even show any remorse to a helpless young lady on the streets who just knocked off from work.\n\nSenator Christopher Mutsvangwa used Mnangagwas case to justify the death penalty abolition.\n\n10 years on death row. This is a case study at a personal level of somebody who faced the prospect of death at the hands of the State.\n\nI support the abolition of the death penalty because our criminal justice system in this country and beyond is not 100% effective,hesaid.\n\n",

The plan builds on the recently concluded Zimbabwe National Industrial Development Policy, which ran from 2019 to 2023.\n\nAmong the governments measures to tackle smuggling are the establishment of police roadblocks along highways and inspections of retail outlets across the country.\n\nSmuggling also affects the collection of customs and excise duties and discourages investment, Finance, Economic Development, and Investment Promotion Minister Mthuli Ncube said during his 2025 national budget presentation in Parliament last month.\n\nIn addition, smuggling is a threat to public health and safety as smuggled goods, in particular, food items, medicines, and alcohol are not subject to health and safety controls, said Ncube.\n\nThe Consumer Protection Commission, a national body that safeguards consumer rights, recently reported the presence of counterfeit items in the market, including toothpaste, cooking oil, drinks, and baked beans.\n\nDont fall for fake products. They might be cheaper, but they can cost you your health, your safety, and even your life, warned the commission on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nConsumers have also raised concerns over the proliferation of products in the market.\n\nAuthorities should continue conducting impromptu inspections on retailers and vendors to protect the public especially as people do their end-of-year shopping for the holidays, said Leon Nkhata, a resident in Harare. He expressed concern about substandard goods, including repackaged and underweight products like mealie meal, rice, and sugar.\n\n",

Our target is to be operating in two regional countries by June 30 2025.\n\nRight now my feeling is that we are likely to get into the international markets much faster and quicker using some of our subsidiaries outside the bank because going the route of the bank establishment in a foreign land tends to be over-regulated in a lot of countries and the capital requirements for setting up a bank tend to be higher, he said.\n\nNyazema said CBZHL must not be viewed as just a bank but a group with subsidiaries which can be seized to perform regional tasks.\n\nSo we have businesses that are capital lite which have done so well locally. You look at our Asset Management which trades as Datvest . What will stop us from taking this company to another region and using its success story achieved in Zimbabwe?\n\nHe expressed optimism that by June 30 2025, CBZHL, through its subsidiaries, will be present in two countries in the region.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Heart Main Arena being built in Kwekwe is taking shape, with its pitch bow almost done while construction of dressing rooms and terraces is ahead of schedule.\n\nIts construction is set to be complete by the end of January, tentatively two months before the start of the 2025 Castle Lager season.\n\nOwned by Yadah proprietor Prophet Walter Magaya and business partner Richard Chahwanda, the ground is expected to ease pressure on the few pitches approved for top-flight football use in Zimbabwe.\n\nMaterial for the grandstands has arrived, bucket seats will be delivered in two weeks and work on the pitch will be finalised before this month, said Magaya.\n\nThis stadium will be bigger than The Heart Stadium in Harare in terms of seating capacity and parking space.\n\nThe VIP stand will be three stories high, and accommodate a medical clinic and offices for ZIFAs Midlands province.\n\nConstruction is being constantly directed by a CAF-approved expert as there are plans to have it homologated for use in international competitions.\n\nMagaya owns The Heart Stadium, home of his Yadah and has built two more similar facilities in Mozambique and Malawi.\n\nCurrently, Zimbabwe does not have a single stadium approved by CAF to hold international matches, a position that has seen its national team, the Warriors hosting home matches in South Africa and Uganda.\n\nDeputy Sports Minister Emily Jesaya, who toured the facility recently encouraged other private players to also take part in the rehabilitation of old sports facilities in support of government efforts.\n\nI did not expect to see such high standards when I visited this facility. It is what we hope could be replicated by the corporate sector. This will surely go a long way, said Jesaya.\n\nMagaya is expected to run for ZIFA president in January. Reports indicate that he submitted his papers on deadline day, late Wednesday.\n\nHe fancies his chances against former legislator Temba Mliswa, ex-Warriors captain Benjani Mwaruwari and Nqobile Magwizi, who are some of the heavyweights vying for the top post.\n\n",
