            "content": "BBC\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said he and his budget director will work out which Democrat Agencies to cut as the US government shutdown approached its third day.\n\nHe suggested Republicans should seize the opportunity to clear out dead wood and gave no hint of concessions to Democratic demands that legislation funding the government should include healthcare insurance subsidies.\n\nRepublicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill, meanwhile, continued to blame each other for failing to keep federal agencies open.\n\nHundreds of thousands of federal workers are staying home, while others worked without pay. Some federal attractions closed to visitors while others, including the Statue of Liberty, stayed open.\n\nAnalysts dont expect either side to budge without pressure from everyday Americans, most of whom have yet to feel direct impacts on their lives.\n\nIt was unclear exactly what Trump could decide in Thursdays meeting with Russell Vought, director of the US Office of Management and Budget (OMB).\n\nWhen Congress fails to keep the US government open, the OMB director works with the president to pick which government activities should stop and which are essential.\n\nIt then gives directions to federal agencies about which employees to place on furlough, which means unpaid leave.\n\nOn the first day of the shutdown, Vought said the White House had moved to pause or cancel billions of dollars in funding meant for Democratic states, including $18bn (13.4bn) in infrastructure projects in New York  home of both Senator Chuck Schumer and the Democratic leader of the House of Representatives, Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nBoth sides must come together to pass legislation if the government is to reopen.\n\nRepublicans need eight Democratic senators to vote with them, while Democrats need 13 Republicans to side with them. Only three Democrats joined with Republicans on the last failed vote in the Senate on Wednesday.\n\nLawmakers are expected to try again on Friday afternoon to resolve the impasse with a vote in the Senate.\n\nRepublicans want to pass a funding measure without anything else attached, but Democrats want to include a renewal of health insurance subsidies for low-income individuals set to expire at the end of the year.\n\nIn duelling press conferences on Capitol Hill on Thursday, neither party appeared willing to give ground.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson called Democrats selfish, dubbed it the Democrat shutdown, and said he would not negotiate on adding insurance subsidies  or other measures  to government funding.\n\nJeffries accused Republicans of not wanting to provide working-class Americans with healthcare and said Trumps threats to fire more federal workers were pointless. He noted: They have been firing federal employees all along.\n\nLee Miringoff, director of the Marist University Institute for Public Opinion, said his polling suggested Americans were largely split down party lines when it came to assigning fault for the shutdown.\n\nMajorities of both Democratic and Republican respondents to his polls blamed the other party for the shutdown, he said, while 41% of independents said both parties shared the blame equally.\n\nBoth of the parties have mastered the finger-pointing, and all were left with is a growing number of people think the country is headed in the wrong direction, Miringoff said.\n\nHe expected Americans to put pressure on Congress to reopen the government  but not until they see the impact of a shutdown on their own lives.\n\nAs politicians traded barbs, US government services started to grind to a halt and thousands of federal workers stayed home.\n\nAbout 750,000 federal workers were expected to take unpaid leave, according to an estimate from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO).\n\nFederal employees deemed essential continued to work, though without pay. They include more than 200,000 law enforcement officers.\n\nAir traffic controllers and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) workers are considered essential, so air travel will not immediately be affected.\n\nDuring the last shutdown these employees increasingly began to call in sick, leading to some delays at major airports.\n\nTourists were turned away from museums in Washington and New York, including at Federal Hall in Manhattan.\n\nA manager told the BBC the building was closed like other federal monuments.\n\nGeorge Washington, the first US president, took the oath of office there in 1789. Now a museum, the historic building also was home to the first Congress and Supreme Court.\n\nBut not all monuments are closed.\n\nElsewhere in New York, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island remained open, thanks to the leadership of President Donald J Trump, a Department of the Interior spokesperson told the BBC.\n\nThe Smithsonian, which includes more than a dozen museums and attractions that drew nearly 17 million visitors last year, told the BBC it had enough money to stay open for a week.\n\n",

            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nThe Chairperson of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Budget and Finance, Energy Mutodi, has demanded that the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance, George Guvamatanga, be summoned by Parliament to clear his name following allegations of corruption involving alarming sums in dealings with contractors.\n\nMutodi told Parliament on Thursday that Guvamatanga is allegedly demanding kickbacks of between five and ten percent from contractors, with the threat that their payments will not be processed if they fail to comply.\n\nHe added that Guvamatanga has allegedly made millions through corruption and has repeatedly refused to appear before Parliament when called upon to clear his name, all without any consequences.\n\nMutodi said it is high time Guvamatanga is invited to explain himself, as his actions are tarnishing Zimbabwes reputation.\n\nOur Government cannot be tarnished by the actions of corrupt and greedy people who occupy public office. I therefore urge this House to ensure that we call the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance, Mr. George Guvamatanga to come and appear before this August House and answer charges of corruption, answer charges of asking to be paid a five to ten percent premium by contractors and all payments made by the Treasury.\n\nWe have made several attempts to call George Guvamatanga to appear before this August House and he has deliberately refused with impunity. This cannot continue, Mutodi said.\n\nHe added that Guvamatangas conduct is now deterring contractors who are no longer interested in providing services to the government, because they fear being asked to pay kickbacks.\n\nMutodi further stated that every government employee, including Permanent Secretaries from all ministries, is accountable to the Parliament of Zimbabwe and therefore must be held to account and answer questions.\n\nIn terms of Section 119 (3) of the Constitution of Zimbabwe, all MDAs, including the Ministry of Finance, the Permanent Secretary and all directors in that office are accountable to Parliament. For that reason, these permanent secretaries, the directors and different officials in these ministries are not undertaking their own personal businesses in those offices but they are being delegated by us because it is us who are elected by the people.\n\nActing Speaker of the National Assembly, Naledi Maunganidze, said the Minister of Finance, Professor Mthuli Ncube, will be made to respond to Parliament.\n\nYesterday, Mutodi took to X, accusing Guvamatanga of sending mercenaries to intimidate him and anyone else who raises corruption issues involving his name.\n\nCorruption is rampant in Zimbabwe, with Vice President Constantino Chiwenga describing it as a national security threat.\n\nAccording to figures cited by National Prosecutor General Justice Matanda-Moyo, Zimbabwe is losing a staggering US$2 billion annually due to corruption and illicit financial dealings.\n\n",

GG as he is notoriously called has accumulated more thanUS$1 billion becoming the richest civil servant, said Mutodi.\n\nContractors, Ministries and Departments refusing to pay Guvamatanga a kick back of at least 5% after receiving Treasury payments have been denied payments for several months even if the funds are budgeted for.\n\nOver the past six months, Parliament itself has struggled to operate after being denied its budgeted funds by George Guvamatanga. A civil servant earning less than $1000 GG has more than 5000 dairy cattle, dairy equipment and several mansions hence the proposed lifestyle audit.\n\nOnecontractor Bitumen which was contracted to do roads has been asked to pay US$200,000 byGuvamatangafor every $2,000,000 weekly payment he authorises that theyreceive and they have made several complaints tomembers of the Budget Committee at Parliament.\n\nGuvamatanga was earlier this year accused of receiving bribes from shadowy businessman Wicknel Chivayo to approve payments to the controversialRen-Form CC, a South African company that supplied Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) with voting material at highly inflated prices.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa is said to have fired and forgiven him in June this year before he begged for the job he has kept since 2018.\n\nAZanu PF Member of Parliament (MP) for Bikita South, Mutodiclaimed Guvamatanga had made threats to deal with him if the committee was to ever seek a lifestyle audit or engage the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC).\n\nHe added: Guvamatangahas also made threats to senda terror team to deal with the(me)upon hearing that the Committee was considering carrying out a life audit on him as well as asking for a ZACC probe.\n\n",
