            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nIn a potential sign of overstepping, the Speaker of the National Assembly, Jacob Mudenda, bluntly told the opposition legislators that they are responsible for the economic sanctions on Zimbabwe.\n\nMudenda said this recently in the National Assembly during a Question and Answer session when Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) legislator, Shakespeare Hamauswa, sought his protection after Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Ziyambi Ziyambi insinuated that the opposition was responsible for the sanctions-induced downfall of the economy.\n\nWe are now developing a serious problem in this House. Whenever we passionately ask questions which are aimed at advancing the lives of Zimbabweans, we are met with insinuations that you are the owners of sanctions, you are the people who brought sanctions, which is not really fair, said Hamauswa.\n\nIn response, Mudenda bluntly told the National Assembly that the leaders of the opposition had invited economic sanctions on the country.\n\nThe element of sanctions is very genuine. If you recall the earlier leaders of the opposition, then MDC, they actually went to America to ask for those sanctions. Please recall. If you do not know your history, can you research on it? said Mudenda.\n\nSanctions have been a point of contention in Zimbabwean politics, with the ruling party ZANU PF using them as an excuse for the decay of the economy.\n\nThe economic ruin is marked by the comatose industry.\n\nThe government predicted to have lost millions in funding as a result of sanctions that were imposed by the United States of America and Britain.\n\n",

The Zimbabwean government has proposed a freeze on headcount before, including in last years budget, though the policy hasnt been implemented.\n\nTreasury has noted with concern the size of the civil service in non-critical sectors, despite the recruitment freeze policy stance, Guvamatanga said. For 2026, the recruitment freeze will apply to all sectors with the exception of health, education and the security sector to a limited extent.\n\nZimbabwes government employs 330,000 people, whose wages account for about56%of the southern African nations 276.4 billion ZiG ($10.4 billion) budget. The International Monetary Fund in June cited public-sector pay as one of the key fiscal pressures the country faces.\n\nThe finance ministry plans to start the consultation process for the 2026 budget later this month. Guidelines will be issued by Sept. 20 that will include spending ceilings for government ministries, departments and agencies, according to the circular.\n\n",

            "content": "ByAlois Vinga\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncube has followed through on his pledge to overhaul Zimbabwes costly and repetitive licensing regime after experiencing first-hand the burden his wife faced while registering a restaurant in Bulawayo last year.\n\nFor years, the business community has decried multiple licensing requirements, with companies forced to pay separate fees for different departments operating under the same roof. For example, a supermarket must obtain separate bakery, butchery, restaurant, and liquor licences to operate fully.\n\nNcube, who last year told the Womens Prosperity Conference that his wife had presented him with a long list of licences required before opening her restaurant, admitted the system was excessive.\n\nOn the issue of licences, I totally agree with what women in business are saying. Just recently, my wife showed me a very long list of licences she had to pay before opening a restaurant in Bulawayo. Its just too much for a single business, Ncube said at the time, promising urgent reforms.\n\nNcube on Wednesday unveiled a raft of measures aimed at reducing the cost of doing business and improving Zimbabwes competitiveness.\n\nThe first tranche, which is targeting the agricultural value chain, has seen the requirement for a Small Scale Farmers registration fees of US$500 being scrapped, while the Dairy Processor Registration of US$350 per annum being reduced to a once-off US$50.\n\nFeed manufacturing registration fees were reduced from US$250 to US$20 while livestock movement clearance which attracted US$10 per herd, will now require US$5 per herd.\n\nThe livestock genetics import permit, which was pegged at US$100 will now attract just US$20 while the meat export registration, which was pegged at US$500 will now attract US$100.\n\nOther measures include scrapping food handler certificate fees and capping Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) costs at 0.05% of project value, with a maximum of US$100,000.\n\nThe Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA) livestock levy, biosafety permit, and the CBCA certificate are also among the charges that have been scrapped.\n\nThese reforms are part of governments commitment to ease the cost of doing business and create a more competitive economic environment, Ncube said.\n\nNew Licensing Fees\n\n",
