The lack of adherence to these procedural safeguards rendered the previous judgments ineffective and void.\n\nMugabe, appointed bursar on a fixed-term contract from July 2017 to June 2021, was dismissed following clashes with university management. A labour officer later awarded him US$323,036 for unfair dismissal, a ruling UZ unsuccessfully appealed.\n\nRepresenting Mugabe, attorney Tawanda Zhuwarara said the earlier rulings violated fundamental rights enshrined in sections 56 and 71 of the Constitution, adding that the Supreme Courts decision was an arbitrary deprivation of property.\n\nUZs lawyer, G. Madzoka, countered that the application was nothing more than a disguised appeal, arguing that the underlying issues had already been settled.\n\nJustice Rita Makarau noted the unacceptable failure by lower courts to address preliminary points vital to fairness.\n\nDeclaring both earlier rulings void, the Court found the proceedings fraught with irregularities.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nA faction backing Vice President Constantino Chiwenga to succeed President Emmerson Mnangagwa when his constitutional term ends in 2028 has emerged from the just-ended Zanu PF National Peoples Conference nursing deep political wounds.\n\nThe conference opened with a tense Politburo meeting at the ruling partys headquarters, which marked the start of an intensified onslaught by Mnangagwas loyalists against Chiwengas camp.\n\nZanu PFs Secretary for Legal Affairs, Ziyambi Ziyambi, delivered a strongly worded response to Chiwenga, who had earlier expressed discontent over the alleged capture of the party by a clique of influential figures.\n\nZiyambis statement effectively drew battle lines within the ruling party, setting the tone for the Mutare conference, where delegates resolved to amend the constitution to extend Mnangagwas tenure, a major setback for Chiwengas succession ambitions.\n\nPolitical analyst Rejoice Ngwenya says it will take an extraordinary strategy for Chiwenga to recover from the political setback suffered at the just-ended Zanu PF conference.\n\nThe tragedy is that Chiwenga himself has not said he has any interest in succeeding Emmerson Mnangagwa. There are people talking on his behalf, the Bombshell Gezas, but Chiwenga has not publicly expressed interest in higher office.\n\nHowever, from experience, we know that during the turbulence at the end of Robert Mugabes rule, Mnangagwa never openly declared his ambitions to succeed Mugabe. He kept quiet and did most of his machinations behind the scenes.\n\nSo we might be hearing a lot of noise about the Chiwenga faction, but we do not know what is happening in the background. His silence says a lot because it would be unwise for him to speak openly about it now, whatever plans he may have. But from where I stand, given the mandate and legitimacy Mnangagwa enjoys within Zanu PF, it would take a miracle for Chiwenga to recover from this, said Ngwenya.\n\nZanu PF is reportedly preparing a constitutional amendment in Parliament to allow President Mnangagwa to remain in power beyond the 2028 elections.\n\nHowever, the ruling party faces major legal hurdles, including Section 91(2), which bars a president from seeking a third term, and Section 328(7), which prohibits an incumbent from benefiting from a constitutional amendment enacted during their tenure.\n\nA leaked dossier, allegedly authored by Chiwenga, claims that Zanu PF intends to smuggle a document titled Breaking Barriers Initiative (BBI) into Parliament to suspend elections and extend both the presidents and the legislatures terms.\n\nNgwenya, however, dismissed the documents credibility, which is said to be linked to self-imposed CCC Secretary General, Sengezo Tshabangu.\n\nBBI is moribund because it tinkers with the illusion that you can simply change the constitution to achieve anything. My assumption is that not everyone within Zanu PF supports this agenda.\n\nThey might not say it publicly, but its nave to assume that if this matter goes to Parliament, it would automatically pass. BBI is just an academic document, Ngwenya said.\n\n",

In accordance with World Health Organisation (WHO) protocols, the detection of even a single confirmed case necessitates the declaration of an outbreak, prompting health authorities to launch an immediate response.\n\nThe MoHSS has assured the Namibian public that the countrys robust surveillance system is primed to identify and monitor individuals exhibiting signs of mpox. Additional cases are being actively sought, while health authorities in the Erongo region are closely monitoring the patients immediate contacts to prevent further spread of the virus.\n\nMpox is a zoonotic disease caused by an orthopox virus, resulting in smallpox-like symptoms in humans. This outbreak follows a concerning trend, as multiple countries within Africa, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Zambia, Malawi, and Tanzania, are reporting active mpox cases.\n\nMpox symptoms typically manifest after an incubation period ranging from 5 to 21 days and can include:\n\nThe rash often appears on the face, palms, and soles of the feet, and can also affect the mouth, genitals, and eyes. Symptoms generally last from two to four weeks, during which the infected individuals are capable of transmitting the virus to others.\n\nHuman-to-human transmission occurs primarily through direct contact with respiratory secretions, bodily fluids, or skin lesions of an infected person. The MoHSS outlines several potential avenues for transmission, including:\n\nAs mpox can affect anyone regardless of demographic, the MoHSS urges the public to take preventive measures. These include:\n\nIn light of this outbreak, the MoHSS has mobilised necessary resources to respond effectively, emphasising the importance of public cooperation. Citizens are encouraged to remain calm and to refrain from spreading unverified information, which could instigate unnecessary panic or stigma towards affected individuals and their families.\n\nAs Namibian health officials continue to monitor the situation closely, ongoing updates will be provided to keep the public informed. The health and well-being of all citizens remain a top priority for the government and health authorities.\n\n",

It does not end when the doors close; rather its an ecosystem that connects communities through their stories, said the founder.\n\nThe first edition of the conference saw more than 130 participants from across Africa and the diaspora.\n\nAfrotellers has grown into a continental movement connecting artists, activists and thinkers through community storytelling hubs in Malawi, South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, DR Congo, Lesotho and Zimbabwe.\n\nFrom village gatherings to urban collectives, we are seeing a shared language of resistance, creativity and care emerging across Africa, Chivhanga said.\n\nThis years edition will build on the foundation that was laid in the previous year by exploring storytelling as infrastructure  shaping how Africans imagine themselves, relate to one another and influence how the continent is perceived globally.\n\nSome of the speakers for this years Afrotellers include playwright and scholar Dr Refiloe Lepere, Zimbabwean political organiser Gift Ostallos Siziba, visual activist Prof. Sir Zanele Muholi, Ugandan philanthropy leader Jackie Asiimwe, playwright and director Monageng Vice Motshabi and photographer Andrew Tshabangu.\n\n",
