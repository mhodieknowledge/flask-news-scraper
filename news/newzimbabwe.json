He also lied that he could process CoS for qualified nurses intending to secure employment in the United Kingdom (UK).\n\nFollowing his conviction, the presiding magistrate sentenced Vanhuvaone to 84 months in jail, suspending 18 months for five years on condition of good behaviour. A further 24 months were set aside on condition that he restitutes the complainants US$8,165 by July 30, 2025. He will, therefore, serve an effective 42 months imprisonment.\n\nThe National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) said this case sends a strong message to would-be conmen on the dire consequences of fraud, especially when public trust is manipulated for personal gain.\n\n",

I strongly encourage efforts to fight this cancer in Zimbabwes economy that robs the Zimbabwean people of the benefit of their precious resources and raises exponentially the cost of doing business in Zimbabwe, she said.\n\nTremont added that a corruption-free business and trade investment environment would make the sector vibrant and lucrative for the people of Zimbabwe.\n\nA healthy, vibrant investment climate would create a culture of opportunity  an opportunity for what our founders 249 years ago called life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That is what we celebrate today, she said.\n\nAlthough he did not directly address the issue of corruption, Foreign Affairs Minister Amon Murwira reiterated Zimbabwes commitment to enhancing its investment climate. He admitted that the country is still learning and expressed pride in taking inspiration from the US.\n\nWe wish, therefore, to invite all potential United States investors to come and invest in Zimbabwe. As you are aware, the government of Zimbabwe is enhancing the investment climate with a view to safeguarding investors interests and guaranteeing the protection of investments. In 45 years, we have learned a lot. We are still learning a lot. We are not 249 years, Murwira said.\n\nThe latest Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI) reflects a worsening corruption situation in Zimbabwes public sector, according to Transparency International (TI), and the country has performed poorly on global corruption indices for years.\n\nThe CPI ranks Zimbabwe 158th out of 180 countries, where the top-ranked country is perceived to have the most honest public sector.\n\nIn 2023, Zimbabwe was ranked 149th, meaning the level of corruption has increased, with the Southern African country slipping nine steps down the scale.\n\nCurrently,questions have been raised overthe cost of the recently commissioned Trabablas Interchange in Harare. Many believe the US$88 million price tag is excessive compared to regional market rates.\n\n",

I firmly believe that these recent geopolitical developments should serve as a powerful wake-up call for our region, a call for us to unite, cooperate, and integrate more, he said.\n\nMagosi expressed deep concern over low inter-regional trade within SADC, which stands at 18 percent, despite the establishment of the SADC Free Trade Area (FTA) in 2008.\n\nThe full implementation of the SADC FTA by all SADC member states remains critical in ensuring enhanced market access, leveraging on the gains from trade to grow our economies, Magosi said.\n\nThe SADC is a 16-member regional bloc, comprising Angola, Botswana, the Comoros, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Eswatini, Lesotho, Madagascar, Malawi, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.\n\n",

It involves lifting people in and out of bed all day, feeding them and sometimes changing their diapers. All that while keeping on top of their housework too.\n\nFor Ruby, a 30-year-old mother of three from Zimbabwe, this wasnt her dream job, but that didnt matter. She was determined to give her kids a better life. So she sacrificed her career as a teacher and left her kids back home in Zimbabwe to become a care worker in the UK.\n\nRuby wont let anything stand in the way of getting her kids and husband to England, where they can receive free education and healthcare, things she doesnt have in Zimbabwe. But therealquestion is: Can Ruby sustain the punishing routine long enough to pull it off?\n\nGreener Pastures, a podcast episode byRadio Workshop, captures the highs and lows of Rubys mission: the intimate relationship she built with her client, the joy of her husbands first day of work in the UK and the madness of working opposite shifts. And not least, Rubys momentous trip home to get the kids.\n\nWhen Ruby arrived in the UK in January 2024, she quickly learnt that the real England is far from the romanticised version people have back home.\n\nWhile not exactly the greener pastures she expected, her visa offered her the opportunity to earn pounds. After struggling to support her family on a teachers salary in Zimbabwe, that meant everything to her.\n\nRubys first job involved providing round-the-clock care to a woman in her nineties. She was paid to work eight hours a day, but it was a 24-hour job. She says sometimes shed call her friends just to cry.\n\nBut Ruby says she was lucky. The woman she was caring for was kind and did everything she could to make Ruby feel at home. Not like the horror stories Ruby heard from colleagues about being spat on by racist clients.\n\nBut arguably, the biggest challenge will begin with the start of their family life in the UK. Ruby explained: In a year or two, [the kids are] going to be different people. But, I am there to remind them of their roots.\n\n",

Such ingratitude, Musk wrote in a post responding to Trumps remarks about him.\n\nWhile speaking with reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said that he was very disappointed by Musks vocal criticisms of the bill. The president claimed that Musk knew what was in the bill and had no problem with it until the EV incentives had to be cut.\n\nIm very disappointed because Elon knew the inner workings of this bill better than almost anybody sitting here, better than you people. He knew everything about it. He had no problem with it, Trump said. All of a sudden, he had a problem. And he only developed the problem when he found out that were going to have to cut the EV mandate.\n\nMusk pushed back on the presidents claim in another post on X and said that this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!\n\nThe Tesla founder has been a vocal critic of the Trump administration and Republicans over the last few days because of the legislation that the president has pushed. Musk has taken to calling it the Big Ugly Bill and at one point advocated for a Slim, Beautiful Bill.\n\nEarlier on Thursday, Musk highlighted Trumps old posts that seemingly align with the tech billionaires current positions and objections to the Big, Beautiful Bill.\n\nTrump turned to social media on Thursday afternoon to criticize Musk, who he appointed to find ways to cut $2 trillion after forming the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nElon was wearing thin, I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY! Trump said in one post.\n\nThe easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elons Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didnt do it! he wrote in another.\n\nMusk has also faced criticism from House Speaker Mike Johnson, who said on Wednesday that he was surprised by the former DOGE leaders objections to the legislation. The Republican lawmaker said that he and Musk, whom he considers a friend, had a great conversation about the bill on Monday. Johnson told reporters on Wednesday that Musk was flat wrong about the legislation.\n\nMeanwhile, there are several Republicans who have expressed solidarity with Musk, including Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah. Additionally, Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., said that Musk was right to be concerned that Americans are quickly becoming debt slaves.\n\nNow that the bill has passed the house, its up to the Senate to meet Trumps July 4 deadline.\n\n",
