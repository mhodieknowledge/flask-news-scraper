            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nPAN African financial services institution, Ecobanks partnership with Care International in Zimbabwe is set to see 450 schoolgirls receiving reusable menstrual hygiene kits as part of efforts to curb the tide of period poverty.\n\nMore than three million women and girls in the Southern Africa nation menstruate and the majority of them do not have proper and sufficient menstrual protection. According to a study by SNV Zimbabwe, 72% of menstruating schoolgirls do not use sanitary products simply because they cannot afford them.\n\nThe study also showed that 62% of schoolgirls in Zimbabwe miss school every month due to lack of sanitary pads and 70% of these girls are not even aware of any sanitary pads brand on the market.\n\nIn a gesture to commemorate the 2025 Menstrual Hygiene Day last Friday, Ecobank handed over a consignment of 450 menstrual hygiene kits for onward distribution to deserving school girls in Tsholothso District.\n\nThe kits include two packs of reusable sanitary pads totalling eight that will last for two to three years, two pairs of underwear, washing and bathing soap, toothbrush and toothpaste, a five litre bucket for soaking and a bath towel.\n\nSpeaking at the handover ceremony, Ecobanks Regional Head Consumer Banking, Patricia Mungwadzi-Musemesi committed to give a hand in alleviating period poverty.\n\nThis donation comes at a critical time. Across Zimbabwe, almost 60% of girls in rural schools miss school every month due to lack of access to menstrual hygiene products. That is not just a statisticit is a crisis. And it is one we must confront together.\n\nShe said the commitment to girls and women is not new to Ecobank as she chronicled the assistance extended to women and girls in Buhera and Lupane where projects inclined towards promoting financial inclusion for rural women, helping them access savings, credit, and training to build stronger futures have been rolled out.\n\nAt Ecobank, we are proud signatories of the UN Womens Empowerment Principles, and through our Ellevate programme, we have supported over 73,000 women-led businesses across Africa, providing over US$177 million in funding. We believe that when women and girls thrive, communities prosper.\n\nThis is what A Better Way means to usnot just better banking, but better lives. It means standing with girls in Tsholotsho, in Buhera, in Lupane, and across Zimbabwe. It means ensuring that no girl is left behind because of her period, Mungwadzi-Musemesi said.\n\nCare Zimbabwe Country Director, Walter Mwasaa said the humanitarian organisation places the welfare of women at the heart of its operations.\n\nAt Care Zimbabwe, we believe that no girl should ever have to choose between her education and her period. Yet, for millions of girls across our country, that is the painful reality. Period poverty is not just a health issueit is a barrier to opportunity, to equality, and to hope.\n\nThat is why we are proud to be taking this donation to Thsolotsho launching the Period Power Initiative in partnership with Ecobank, he said.\n\nThe Primary and Secondary Education Ministrys chief director for Learner Welfare ,Psychological Services and Special Needs Education, Hannah Maisiri hailed the donation saying the event was more than a celebrationit is a reaffirmation of our shared commitment to ensuring that no girl is left behind because of her period.\n\nWhen girls miss school every month due to lack of access to sanitary products, their education, confidence, and future are all put at risk. That is why the Government of Zimbabwe, through the Ministry of Education, has made it a priority to support menstrual hygiene management in schools, she said.\n\n",

            "content": "By BBC\n\nTHOUSANDS of people with alcohol-related brain damage (ARBD) could be going undiagnosed, an expert says.\n\nResearch suggests consuming 35 units of alcohol per week for five years or more can cause ARBD, which affects a persons ability to carry out basic daily tasks.Lee Caldwell, 56, who was diagnosed with ARBD last year, said he struggled with short-term memory and impulse control.Prof Gareth Roderique Davies said stigma and lack of awareness led to ARBD being missed or misdiagnosed, and said adequate resources remained a challenge.The Welsh government said it was investing 67m to help people affected by drugs and alcohol, including ARBD.If left undiagnosed, patients with ARBD can end up requiring long term nursing care, but with the right intervention they can improve and live independently.Mr Caldwell was admitted to Brynawel House, a residential rehabilitation facility in south Wales, where he was diagnosed with ARBD last September.He said at the peak of his drinking he found it easier to cross the road to the garage to buy alcohol than to confront the feelings of guilt and shame associated with his habit.The addiction became more important than living, said Mr Caldwell, a former Royal Navy engineer and construction manager.Explaining the daily challenges ARBD could present, he said: One day [in rehab] I couldnt find my room.I could see room seven, theres eight  wheres nine?This lad I got on with said: It would help if you were in the right building  you live over there.Mr Caldwell said his longer term memory was unaffected but he struggled with silly things like whether he had taken his medication, as well as impulse control.How many units are in alcoholic drinks?Pint of lower strength lager, beer or cider  2 unitsPint of higher strength lager, beer or cider  3 unitsSmall glass of wine (125ml)  1.5 unitsLarge glass of wine (250ml)  3 unitsSingle shot of spirits (25ml)  1 unitSource: NHSMr Caldwell said since undergoing six months of rehabilitation: I dont wake up with cravings now and I am getting physically more and more fit.But I still worry about going out somewhere Im not familiar with, he added.With ARBD, as youre recovering, your memory comes back, which doesnt happen to many people really.Mr Caldwell had mixed feelings about leaving and returning to his home area of north Wales.I knew I could do it  but I know Im an addict, so I was always waiting for that demon.Asked if he could see how far he had come, he said: No. But I can see how far Im going to go.Sue has shoulder length reddish brown hair and is wearing a V-neck green, linen top and silver necklace. She is stood in the grounds of Brynawel House on a sunny day, with the polytunnel in the background where horticultural therapy takes place.Sue Gwyn says alcohol-related brain damage has become more of an issue since the pandemicPost-pandemic we are seeing people with far more extensive brain problems because of their drinking, said Sue Gwyn, chief executive of Brynawel House.The charity provides rehabilitation for substance misuse, but specialises in ARBD.She said patients were typically referred by local authorities and their cognitive function was then assessed.Even as low as 35 units of alcohol a week for maybe four or five years can impact on your brain, said Ms Gwyn.Sometimes [patients] will have been working with community services for 18 months but ARBD hasnt been picked up.And thats a worry because we know that up to 75% of people with ARBD, if they have rehab, they can make a very meaningful recovery.If its not picked up the outcomes will be poorer for them, and in the most severe cases theyre going to end up in long term nursing care.When you think that 36 units is around four bottles of wine, there are an awful lot of people who will be routinely drinking that as a minimum every week and thinking thats OK because they havent got obvious liver problems.But we are as worried about peoples brains as we are about anything else.We see a massive change in people by the time they leave, said occupational therapist at Brynawel House, Jan Bevan.Life evolved around alcohol and when they could get their next drink. But theyre actually looking at a future and whats meaningful, because theyd forgotten what meaningful is.She said part of her work was to help patients to build routines, with prompts to aid memory.My job is to ensure that when they go from here they have strategies and support to enable them to carry on.As a charity and the only not-for-profit providing ARBD rehabilitation in Wales, Ms Gwyn said funding arrangements were not clear cut.While area planning boards have ringfenced funding for addiction support, she said few would fund ARBD rehabilitation.Support at Brynawel House, which includes a multi-disciplinary team and costs 1,760 a week, is provided for a minimum of six months.If you look at the long-term impact of somebody having to go into residential care for maybe 10 or 20 years, then six months or a year spent in rehab here, I think it is money well invested, she said.Jan is smiling at the camera as she stands in the large lawned grounds of Brynawel House on a sunny day.

He is stood with the large lawns of Brynawel House in the background. He is wearing dark rimmed glasses, a navy blazer and a patterned, pale blue shirt.Prof Gareth Roderique Davies says there are likely to be thousands of people in Wales with a potential ARBD diagnosisProf Davies said stigma played a big role in people being correctly diagnosed.Individuals who are drinking excessively may present as confused and chaotic and possibly even aggressive and that immediately means theyre treated in a stigmatised way, he said.Whereas in fact theyre exhibiting signs of alcohol related brain damage. But the pathways to recovery are really, really ill defined.There is some evidence suggesting some individuals with ARBD are being misdiagnosed with early onset dementia. But memory clinics are not necessarily the right place for them because thats dealing with a degenerative disorder  whereas if interventions take place at the right time, ARBD doesnt have to get any worse.In many circumstances it can improve with correct intervention.The Welsh government said it was investing more than 67m to help people affected by drugs and alcohol, including people with alcohol related brain damage, to ensure a range of services and support is in place.A spokesperson added: Clinical pathways are a matter for each area planning board area to determine and it is important they work closely with all appropriate organisations to ensure early identification of ARBD.\n\nResearch suggests consuming 35 units of alcohol per week for five years or more can cause ARBD, which affects a persons ability to carry out basic daily tasks.\n\nLee Caldwell, 56, who was diagnosed with ARBD last year, said he struggled with short-term memory and impulse control.Prof Gareth Roderique Davies said stigma and lack of awareness led to ARBD being missed or misdiagnosed, and said adequate resources remained a challenge.The Welsh government said it was investing 67m to help people affected by drugs and alcohol, including ARBD.If left undiagnosed, patients with ARBD can end up requiring long term nursing care, but with the right intervention they can improve and live independently.Mr Caldwell was admitted to Brynawel House, a residential rehabilitation facility in south Wales, where he was diagnosed with ARBD last September.He said at the peak of his drinking he found it easier to cross the road to the garage to buy alcohol than to confront the feelings of guilt and shame associated with his habit.The addiction became more important than living, said Mr Caldwell, a former Royal Navy engineer and construction manager.Explaining the daily challenges ARBD could present, he said: One day [in rehab] I couldnt find my room.I could see room seven, theres eight  wheres nine?This lad I got on with said: It would help if you were in the right building  you live over there.Mr Caldwell said his longer term memory was unaffected but he struggled with silly things like whether he had taken his medication, as well as impulse control.How many units are in alcoholic drinks?Pint of lower strength lager, beer or cider  2 unitsPint of higher strength lager, beer or cider  3 unitsSmall glass of wine (125ml)  1.5 unitsLarge glass of wine (250ml)  3 unitsSingle shot of spirits (25ml)  1 unitSource: NHSMr Caldwell said since undergoing six months of rehabilitation: I dont wake up with cravings now and I am getting physically more and more fit.But I still worry about going out somewhere Im not familiar with, he added.With ARBD, as youre recovering, your memory comes back, which doesnt happen to many people really.Mr Caldwell had mixed feelings about leaving and returning to his home area of north Wales.I knew I could do it  but I know Im an addict, so I was always waiting for that demon.Asked if he could see how far he had come, he said: No. But I can see how far Im going to go.Sue has shoulder length reddish brown hair and is wearing a V-neck green, linen top and silver necklace.

But theyre actually looking at a future and whats meaningful, because theyd forgotten what meaningful is.She said part of her work was to help patients to build routines, with prompts to aid memory.My job is to ensure that when they go from here they have strategies and support to enable them to carry on.As a charity and the only not-for-profit providing ARBD rehabilitation in Wales, Ms Gwyn said funding arrangements were not clear cut.While area planning boards have ringfenced funding for addiction support, she said few would fund ARBD rehabilitation.Support at Brynawel House, which includes a multi-disciplinary team and costs 1,760 a week, is provided for a minimum of six months.If you look at the long-term impact of somebody having to go into residential care for maybe 10 or 20 years, then six months or a year spent in rehab here, I think it is money well invested, she said.Jan is smiling at the camera as she stands in the large lawned grounds of Brynawel House on a sunny day.

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature, and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. This week we want to discuss issues that affect the optimisation of potential returns on real estate. The main issue for discussion is financing, are there any creative financing models you are aware of that can assist our readers to get maximum returns from their properties?\n\nVM: Thank you\n\nYour question is actually in two parts, the first relating to whether or not the actual property in issue is capable of acquiring more value by, for example, a change of use, rezoning or maximising its current use. This process for the propertys optimisation when identified, may result in regulatory costs that can be burdensome to the property owner.\n\nThe second part will naturally follow the first, in that, having identified the opportunity of maximising returns, if we take as an example, creating a mixed-use development on a large tract of previously underutilised land. When raising finance for such a project, there may be a need for a multi-faceted approach that may include potential joint ventures, public-private partnerships et cetera\n\nConventional financial models for such projects have proved burdensome from a cost of money perspective, making such models unsuited and inflexible, in light of the many unforeseens that accompany these developments. A significant number of developments are financed using a mixed bag comprising offshore funding, local private funding commonly through joint ventures, structured debt facilities and pre-sales of the actual development. Some pre-sales actually skirt legal limitations.\n\nReporter:You mention possible joint ventures by private individuals, what processes are you likely to go through in such joint ventures?\n\nVM: That may require a separate interview of its own, however, I will attempt to summarise. Assuming that the joint venture parties have agreed on the fundamentals of the joint venture, the common thing will be to incorporate the joint venture into a company, where the property is then held in the name of the joint venture. The joint venture company is then responsible for the development, capital raises et cetera.\n\nKey to the joint venture company is the background Shareholders and Subscription Agreement, which regulates the relationship between the joint venture parties. It is in this document that you will find issues like capital contributions, which can be in the form of land, expertise or actual money. Other issues may include governance issues relating to decision making or the basics of who does what and the subsequent dispute resolution mechanism where parties fail to agree on certain things. The most important provisions are your profit sharing and distribution mechanisms, which is the point of the relationship.\n\nReporter: What other factors must property owners or developers consider when trying to raise finance for projects?\n\nVM: I suppose in Zimbabwe and the world over actually, issues that appeal to the ESG-focused investor have to be considered, that is, your environmental, social and governance issues. On the environmental side, you naturally start by acquiring your environmental impact assessment reports pre-project and following the recommendations on the implementation phase.\n\nThe project may also look at harnessing alternative solutions to common problems that Zimbabweans face, for example, offering alternative energy systems like solar, water harvesting and conservation methods, and eco-friendly building materials. Some projects have gone as far as to have protective clauses or restrictions on cutting of trees et cetera for beautification and broader environmental conservation purposes.\n\nReporter: Some are postulating that the REIT is another good financing model, what is your take?\n\nVM: The real estate investment trust is attractive in that it allows a broader pool of people to invest in large projects. The attraction is that the buyers of units can own tradable shares in big projects, knowing that the real estate under investment is managed by professionals who are subject to the stringent controls imposed by the Securities Exchange Commission.\n\nAs REITs are relatively new against the historical fatigue that had happened on our capital markets as a result of currency changes, there is still a need for a lot of work in public education on the benefits of REITs.\n\nReporter: In closing, are you suggesting that there is still potential for optimising land in Zimbabwe through creative financing models?\n\nVM: Zimbabwe still has a lot of underutilised privately held land, I can even go further to say even public land which can be accessed through Public Private Partnerships. The goal is to transform the land to its optimum value, be it as residential, commercial or even tourism attractions, at a potential profit for its proprietors. Money follows money; if the value can be created, the financiers and finances can be found.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have to end here, because of our time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nPARLIAMENTARIANS recently took Lands and Agriculture Minister Anxious Masuka to task over grey areas in the newly introduced comprehensive land tenure document.\n\nDuring a Question and Answer session recently, Masuka told Members of Parliament (MPs) that anyone holding an A1 or A2 99-year-lease and permit or lease must surrender the documents to the Lands ministry offices, anywhere around the countrys districts for ownership verification purposes, upon which the process of issuing title deeds which will go for a period of three years begins.\n\nMasuka revealed that 360 000 smallholder farmers and 23 500 commerical farmers will get title deeds.\n\nHowever, some legislators felt the new policy by government will not change much as banks will not accept the title deed as collateral for farming or development loans.\n\nZanu PF Mabvuku-Tafara MP Pedzisai Scott Sakupwanya queried the title deeds bankability.\n\nSome years ago, 99-year leases were introduced as a measure of security of tenure and also as a measure for farmers to obtain loans from banks. What measures, of course as we see today, farmers who hold 99-year leases are unable to obtain loans from banks for their farming activities.\n\nWhat measures, legislative or otherwise, are going to be put in place to ensure that the title deeds as it were, when they come, will guarantee a farmers security in terms of being able to secure loans with these said title deeds? Sakupwanya asked.\n\nMasuka told the august House that the 2013 Constitution indicated that the President may issue more secure tenure documents.\n\nAt that stage, he said, the tenure documents that existed were a lease, a permit or an offer letter.\n\nWhen we had the 99-year lease, the thinking was that this was a more long-term tenure document that would give everyone, including banks, the confidence to land.\n\nThe experience that we have had over the years, of course, is that these tenure documents, the 99-year lease were not readily accepted by banks as collateral.\n\nIt is in this context that the President made the revolutionary step to grant the issuance of title deeds. Title deeds are the ultimate tenure documents and hopefully with consultations from banks, they will be able to take these, Masuka explained.\n\nHe said five banks were already operating within the Department of Lands at the one-stop centre, which are ready to give mortgages for farmers to purchase their land and also to give support to enable those farmers to be productive on their farms.\n\nWe hope that other banks will be able to replicate this and we urge all farmers that have received title deeds to use these documents to be able to access much needed financing to ensure that they become more productive on their land.\n\nMasuka urged A2 and A1 farmers that had not completed the title deed forms to enable them to get these more secure tenure documents to immediately do so.\n\nAnother MP, James sought further clarification over the title deeds.\n\nI take it then that these original title deeds are of no use to government but we see in the compensation plan that you are pursuing, you are asking for these title deed holders to relinquish these title deeds?\n\nPlease, can you allow the clarification to be done? I am just asking that in this compensation plan that is rolling out, the title deed holders have been asked to relinquish these title deeds, James said.\n\nMasuka said this was not true.\n\nLet me clarify the falsehoods that are being peddled. The government has not requested for title deeds because we know they are worthless. We have not requested for those.\n\nIn terms of the Global Compensation Deed which was consummated on the 29th of July in 2020, the government agreed with former farm owners that the compensation for improvements throughout the country were worth US$3.5 billion.\n\nWe never referred to the title deeds and never at any stage requested the former farm owners to return this paper, which we do not consider or value, Masuka said.\n\nMP Gumbo asked the minister to respond to the question of legislative mechanisms that improve the bankability of the said title deeds.\n\nAs much as you say that there are certain banks that have agreed and you are inviting other banks to come to an agreement to lend to our various farmers and title deed holders, the legal status of the said title deeds make it difficult for them to be bankable.\n\nThis is all because the question of ownership is retained in the State. What are the legal mechanisms and the legislative interventions that you are going to present to ensure the bankability of the said title deeds? Gumbo said.\n\nThe minister assured Parliamentarians that the legal aspects had been taken care of in terms of the Constitution and the Zimbabwe Land Commission Act.\n\nThere is no other legislative procedure that is required to make these title deeds. It is all covered in both the Constitution and the Zimbabwe Land Commission Act and is very legal.\n\nThe banks that have come forward already have indicated that these are bankable and transferable and therefore can be utilised as collateral, Masuka replied.\n\nA farmer who spoke to NewZimbabwe.com over the new secure land tenure document or title deed had this to say: The is scepticism around land tenure bankability. The concept of land tenure bankability continues to raise skepticism among us farmers due to the inconsistency in its practical implementation.\n\nWhile in theory, having tenure should provide a foundation for accessing credit, in reality, most farmers find themselves locked out of the financial system.\n\nThe reluctance of banks to recognise these land documents as credible collateral undermines confidence and limits investment in agriculture. Farmers need assurance that their tenure has real financial value, not just symbolic recognition, the farmer (name witheld) said.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/air-zimbabwe-to-sell-two-boeing-777s-as-it-struggles-financially/",
            "content": "TravelandTourWorld\n\nAir Zimbabwe has confirmed it will sell two Boeing 777-200ER passenger aircraft, in a move that reflects the ongoing financial challenges facing the once-proud national carrier. The aircraft, originally acquired from Malaysia Airlines in a bid to revitalize Zimbabwes aviation capabilities, will now be sold on an as-is basis from Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport in Harare. The government is inviting international bidders, with a submission deadline set for July 25, 2025.\n\nThis latest development is part of Air Zimbabwes broader attempt to navigate mounting debts, operational hurdles, and years of alleged mismanagement. Despite efforts to revamp its fleet and reestablish its place as a competitive regional airline, the carrier has struggled to turn things around. The sale of the Boeing 777s  once seen as a symbol of a fresh start  now represents a reality check on the airlines financial position.\n\nWhile Air Zimbabwe had ambitious plans to expand its long-haul operations under the Zimbabwe Airways initiative in 2017, continued economic instability, political interference, and corruption have stifled progress. With foreign debt exceeding US$30 million and no viable strategic partner in sight, the national airline is attempting to cut losses and stay afloat  but at the cost of once-critical assets.\n\nSelling Off the 777s: A Symbolic Step Backward\n\nThe sale of the two Boeing 777-200ER aircraft is not just a financial decision  its a symbolic move that marks yet another setback in Zimbabwes aviation story. Originally leased from Malaysia Airlines with the hope of expanding long-haul routes and elevating the countrys aviation status, the aircraft are now considered liabilities rather than assets. The planes have been grounded for years and have yet to be deployed commercially in any meaningful capacity.\n\nThe decision to offload them now, through a formal government disposal notice, underscores just how far the national carrier has fallen from its peak. While other African airlines have modernized fleets and forged strategic international alliances, Air Zimbabwe continues to be weighed down by legacy debt and a lack of credible turnaround strategies.\n\nA Legacy of Missed Opportunities and Mismanagement\n\nAir Zimbabwe was once a respected name in African aviation. At independence in 1980, the carrier boasted a well-maintained fleet of 15 aircraft, including Boeing 720s and Viscount 700s. It had a strong regional network, excellent safety standards, and loyal passenger traffic. But decades of mismanagement and political interference steadily eroded this foundation.\n\nNumerous leadership changes, funding gaps, and operational inefficiencies led to a steady decline. At various points, the airline was grounded due to unpaid debts to fuel suppliers or airspace access issues. Meanwhile, attempts to restructure the airline or attract private sector investment have repeatedly failed.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Airways project in 2017 was one such initiative. Launched as a fresh start, it involved leasing Boeing 777s and aimed to signal a new era of global connectivity. But with limited routes, lack of technical readiness, and no clear business model, the planes never took off as envisioned.\n\nMounting Debt and Scandals Add to Woes\n\nAir Zimbabwes financial condition remains precarious. With foreign debts exceeding US$30 million and a reputation that discourages international investment, the airline has found it difficult to access funding or build meaningful partnerships. Efforts to find a strategic foreign partner have failed multiple times, as transparency concerns and political complications continue to plague the process.\n\nIn one of the more damning episodes, the airline made headlines over the mysterious disappearance of three Chinese-made MA60 aircraft acquired between 2005 and 2006. Valued at US$48 million, these planes reportedly vanished without trace, and audits revealed no documentation to explain what happened to them. This scandal highlighted deep structural problems and cast serious doubts on the accountability of the airlines management.\n\nCurrent Fleet and the Struggle to Operate\n\nToday, Air Zimbabwes operational fleet is small and aging. The airline has struggled to maintain regular service on even its most important domestic and regional routes. Maintenance delays, spare part shortages, and a skeletal crew all contribute to the challenges.\n\nLast year, the airline leased one of its two remaining Boeing 767 aircraft to Mont Gabaon Airlines in the Democratic Republic of Congo  another move aimed at generating quick revenue rather than building long-term capability. This left Air Zimbabwe with limited options for long-haul travel, further shrinking its already modest route network.\n\nThe Aircraft Sale: Details for Bidders\n\nAccording to the official government disposal notice, the sale of the Boeing 777-200ERs will take place as is, with the aircraft currently stationed at Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport. Only reputable international bidders registered with Zimbabwes Procurement Regulatory Authority (PRAZ) will be eligible to participate. The deadline for submitting bids is July 25, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. local time.\n\nThis sale is likely to attract interest from secondary airlines, parts companies, or cargo operators looking to acquire aircraft at discounted prices. However, the condition and maintenance status of the planes will be key in determining buyer interest.\n\nLooking Ahead: Can Air Zimbabwe Recover?\n\nThe sale of the Boeing 777s is yet another chapter in Air Zimbabwes long history of turbulence. It reflects the urgent need for financial reprieve, but also a shrinking vision of what the airline once hoped to become. While other African carriers are modernizing and expanding, Air Zimbabwe is still stuck in survival mode.\n\nFor a full recovery, industry experts argue that the airline needs more than asset sales  it needs a bold restructuring plan, independent leadership, and international transparency. Without these changes, the future of the national airline remains uncertain.\n\nStill, Zimbabwes geographic position and tourism appeal offer strong potential for air connectivity. If properly managed and strategically positioned, Air Zimbabwe could once again serve as a gateway between Southern Africa and the world. But first, it must clear its debts, rebuild trust, and, most importantly, deliver on service.\n\n",

The case stems from an incident where his pit-bull dogs allegedly attacked and mauled Samuel Machara (39) to death, the police said.\n\nMacharas body has been taken to Parirenyatwa Hospital for a postmortem examination.\n\nThe body of the victim was found near the suspects residence with dog bite wounds. The body was referred to the Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals mortuary for postmortem, added the police.\n\nWard 41 Councillor Kudzai Kadzombe emphasised that dog owners must keep their animals within their property, and that allowing dogs to roam freely is a clear breach of by-laws.\n\nKadzombe also pointed out that keeping more than two dogs in New Bluffhill and surrounding suburbs contravenes local regulations and could lead to imprisonment of up to six months.\n\nOwners are required to secure their properties with proper fencing or gates to prevent dogs from straying. Always keep dogs on a leash or under control when outside the property.\n\nProperties under 2,000 square metres (e.g., Warren Park, Westlea, Cranborne, Mabelreign, Arcadia, Mabvuku, Avondale): Maximum of 2 dogs.\n\nProperties 2,000 square metres or larger (e.g., Greystone Park, Shawasha Hills, Gletwin Park): Maximum of 4 dogs. Violating these regulations can result in a level three fine, imprisonment for up to six months, or both, she said.\n\nMupinga reportedly kept four dogs at his residence: two pit bulls, one Rottweiler, and an Angaran Mastiff.\n\n",
