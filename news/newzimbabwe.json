            "content": "By Calvin Manika | Religion Unplugged\n\nMountains form part of the breathtaking scenery and wildlife sanctuaries of Zimbabwe. They are also historically connected to the lives in nearby communities that call this place home. Pre-independence, most locals used hills and mountains to worship ancestors, believing that the spirit of the departed lives in the cool places of the mountains.\n\nA change in religion and use of places has increased over the past four decades. In fact, mountains have been used by different religions to connect with God.\n\nLocated 30 kilometers (18 miles) outside Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, is a peri-urban sprawling area known as Domboshava. The settlement is known because of its rocky mountains, a range of granite rocks. Mawanga Mountain in the area is the most popular spot, with its large cave. It serves as a sacred site for worship and pilgrimage, emphasizing the historical and spiritual significance of mountains in various religious practices.\n\nA local theology scholar, Charles Pembe, said some independent African churches are no longer denouncing the use of heritage sites for religious beliefs and practices.\n\nInstead, several Christians now come either individually or in small groups to perform their prayers at the mountains, he said. We have heard a lot of pilgrims saying they have met God on a personal level in these mountains compared to church buildings where they congregate every Sunday and other weekdays. It is subjective though.\n\nChurches across Zimbabwe of various denominations climb mountains to seek God and find spiritual uplifting. Most pilgrims frequently pray for the mountains all night long, or they climb early in the morning and remain until the evening. The Domboshava Mountains see a flurry of activity, mostly from Friday through Sunday. Religious communities travel to these mountains from throughout the African country.\n\nDomboshavas vast rocky mountains have enough room to hold hundreds of pilgrims. Of late each church has informally selected their pace, making it possible for churches to pray separately, Pembe added.\n\nVarious pilgrims use the mountains for prayers and for conducting healing sessions. This reflects a broader trend of associating mountains with miracles and spiritual encounters across many cultures and faiths.\n\nZimbabwe today is shared by a diverse populace exposed to different religions and religious ways during their upbringings such as African Traditional Religion, Christianity and Islam, among several others. Conflicts between Christian religious groups and African traditionalists who claim total authority over the site are not always visible, but they do exist.\n\nIn Zimbabwean society, the two most common religions are Christianity and African traditional religion. Its interesting to see that the management of many Zimbabwean cultural sites has prioritized the resources monumentality over their spiritual significance, said Ratidzo Matarure, a local traditional leader.\n\nDomboshava is a heritage site that both locals and tourists can visit. Those sites are controlled by the National Museums and Monuments of Zimbabwe. Despite that, the organization does not easily grant permission for prayers and other religious activities. In Domboshava, for example, Christians have been left to oversee and organize vigils and other activities.\n\nConservative and traditional churches, like the United Methodist Church, have a rich history of mountain prayer dating back decades.\n\nAlthough mountain climbing is a demanding and painful experience, pilgrims claim that it produces fruitful results. One of the pilgrims who has visited the mountains several times said the visits were not in vain and that her life has been changed since she started the praying in the mountains.\n\nI come here to pray for different issues, Tanaka Chiendambuya said. The visits have greatly changed my life and impacted my faith in God. I have seen a change in my family and obtained many blessings.\n\nAs thousands climb these mountains each year, those with resources have always been known to travel to Egypt, climbing Mount Sinai in Israel and various sites from the Bible located in Turkey.\n\nMost churches base the idea of connecting with God in mountains on the Bible, where Jesus looked for a place to serve and connect with God, Pembe said. From that vantage point, many people pray on mountains.\n\n",

However, FDI inflows were US$5.2 billion in South Africa; US$2.5 billion in Mozambique; US$2.3 billion in Namibia; US$208 million in Malawi; US$198 million in Botswana; and US$108 million in Zambia, the analysis said.\n\nThe labour organ blamed the countrys huge tax burden as chief among the causes prompting limited revenue flows.\n\nThe paper argues that no country can prosper with high taxes (Ireland-in 2015 Ireland grew by 26%). It says high taxation results in high informality and low confidence. We need lesser and lower taxes.\n\nAccording to the Chamber of Mines of Zimbabwe (CoMZ), the countrys effective tax rate for miners  69% in 2024  has already surpassed those of Zambia (60%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (61%), Ghana (56%), and South Africa (44%), placing a significant strain on Zimbabwean firms competitiveness.\n\nThe mining sector faces a complex plethora of 157 separate charges, ranging from US$4,000 to US$15,000, imposed by Rural District Councils, government ministries and agencies.\n\nThiscomes on the back of yet another wave of high taxation measures imposed by Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube in the 2025 National Budget.\n\nOverall, all these challenges have left the local economy with a huge competitiveness gap implying that Zimbabwean businesses and products are not able to effectively and successfully compete with businesses and products from other countries, the report said.\n\nThe labour organ contends that such an economic structure hurts job creation as well as the quality of employment on offer.\n\n",

Venancio Mondlane of the opposition party, the Optimist Party for the Development of Mozambique (Podemos), rejected the outcome, mounting allegations of electoral irregularities.\n\nAccording to Mozambican authorities, at least 21 people, including two police officers had been killed in the violence which erupted after the Constitutional Council upheld Chapos victory on December 23.\n\nAn electoral watchdog, Plataforma Decide says this has brought the death toll in the country to 151 since the post-election violence erupted on October 21.\n\nIn a statement, Mnangagwa said that the courts decision exhausts all lawful processes and aligns with Mozambiques national laws and SADCs election guidelines.\n\nThe Southern Africa Development Community, SADC, notes and acknowledges the ruling and confirmation on Monday, 23rd December 2024, by the Constitutional Council of Election results held in the Republic Mozambique on 9th October this year.\n\nThe ruling by that countrys top electoral court, which upheld FRELIMO Partys victory, completes and thus exhausts all lawful processes on determining election results, in line with that countrys national laws, and in keeping with SADCs election guidelines and expectations.\n\nSADC thus expects all parties to the electoral process, both individually and collectively, to abide by the decision of the Council which should provide a constitutional way forward for the country, and facilitate the way to greater peace, normalcy and stability in the interest of all Mozambicans.\n\nMnangagwa and his Zanu PF party have been accused of interfering in Mozambiques election and facilitating rigging as videos circulating online show Zimbabwean nationals voting in the Mozambican elections.\n\nHe added that SADC stands ready to assist the incoming government and the people of Mozambique in consolidating their electoral democracy based on the aforesaid court decision, which should be held sacrosanct by all.\n\nFurther, SADC urges the international community to respect the sovereign will of the people and the Republic of Mozambique, exhorting all concerned to constructively support all processes towards peace, law and order which the country and people sorely need and deserve.\n\nMeanwhile, Mondlane has vowed to install himself as president on January 15, the day that Chapo is expected to assume office.\n\n",

            "content": "By Tawanda Karombo | Christian Science Monitor\n\nIt was 10 p.m. when a frantic pounding on Modester Nyangonis door dragged her out of a deep sleep.\n\nThat hot October day, she had been on her feet manning her stall at the largest market in Zimbabwes capital, a bustling maze of businesses selling everything from dried fish and gas stove accessories to hair extensions.\n\nNow, a neighbor was at her door to tell her that the market where she worked, Mbare Musika, was on fire.\n\nBy the time Ms. Nyangoni reached her stall, nothing was left. The flames had torn through everything in their path, including the cash savings many traders hid with their wares in order to keep them out of Zimbabwes topsy-turvy banking system.\n\nWithin hours, around $5 million in goods, cash, and property went up in smoke, according to official estimates. Nothing was insured.\n\nThe fires devastation is part of a wider crisis: Most Zimbabweans live on the precipice of economic disaster. Over the past two decades, relentless financial crises havedoubledthe number of people here living in extreme poverty  a figure that stands today at about40%. Three-quarters of Zimbabweans toil in the informal workforce, one of the highest rates of off-the-books work in the world. This year, the government introduced a new currency, called the Zimbabwe Gold, or ZiG, to help stabilize the economy. Instead, it has plummeted ordinary Zimbabweans into further uncertainty.\n\nFor traders at Mbare Musika, the fire was simply the last domino to fall.\n\nModester Nyangoni sits at her makeshift stall at Mbare Musika market in Harare, Zimbabwe, which was badly damaged in a fire.\n\nThis was not the first time that many of the traders in Mbare Musika lost their savings in an instant.\n\nIn the early 2000s, a catastrophic agricultural reform program and an expensive war in Congo left Zimbabwes government flat broke. To fill its coffers, it decided to simply print more money, and then more again. By mid-2008, inflation hit 231,000,000%.\n\nMs. Nyangoni remembers her late mother, also a trader, coming home at the end of her workday with big plastic bags full of nearly worthless cash. If they were lucky, the family might be able to exchange the money for a single loaf of bread. The price tag:nearly 100 billionZimbabwean dollars (about $5).\n\nFinally, in 2009, the government stopped printing Zimbabwean dollars, and officially allowed the use of the U.S. dollar and the South African rand. But by then, most Zimbabweans had lost any savings they had.\n\nMeanwhile, multinationals like mining and tobacco companies fled en masse, and even many large local businesses found themselves unable to bear the financial risk of keeping their doors open.\n\nMany simply could not survive the uncertainty, explains Batanai Matsika, a researcher and finance professional in Harare. That, in turn, led to a proliferation of informal players.\n\nWhat he means is that over the next decade, the economy became, increasingly, an unregulated Wild West. People still farmed, mined, and traded  but now they did it all out of the governments reach. Businesses went unregistered, taxes unpaid. Zimbabweans learned to keep their cash close, and bought and sold things in whatever combination of rand and U.S. dollars they happened to have on hand. By 2022, just 30% of adults in Zimbabwe wereregularly usinga bank account.\n\nWe no longer trust keeping money at the banks, explains Irene Mutanga, another trader at Mbare Musika. We are wiser now.\n\nToday, Zimbabwe has one of the worlds largest informal economies, according tothe World Bank, with nearlytwo-thirdsof its gross domestic product generated completely off the books.\n\nMeanwhile, onseveral occasionsover the past decade, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has tried to introduce new local currencies to stabilize the economy. But each time, Zimbabweans skepticism has tanked their value.\n\nLike most Zimbabweans, Ms. Mutanga operates in multiple parallel financial universes every day. At her market stall, she accepts payment for baggies of dried fish in both U.S. dollars and ZiG. Like other traders, she pegs her ZiG prices to the black market exchange rate, which is about twice the official one.\n\nShe then uses her ZiG  now pegged to the official exchange rate  to pay government bills or buy groceries at big-box supermarkets.\n\nMore than a month after the fire at Mbare Musika, Ms. Mutanga says she is still struggling to rebuild what she lost. The market has sprung up again, quite literally from the ashes. But its paved floors are gone, replaced by thick dust that turns to a muddy slurry on rainy days.\n\nOn a recent morning, she rearranged the bags of fish on her table and thought of the bill she owed for her childrens school fees  ZiG 3750, or $150. She was late. The headmaster had given her a month.\n\nAnd so she waited anxiously for her next customer. It was nearing 3 p.m., and so far today, she had sold nothing.\n\n",

With due respect, our client as it stands, does not know the reasons why your committee concluded that he has failed to meet the eligibility criteria stipulated in the ZIFA statutes, 2024 before making your announcement and publishing the final list of candidates, read the letter.\n\nThe barring of the four candidates has left Nqobile Magwizi, Twine Phiri, Marshal Gore, Philemon Machana, Martin Kweza and Makwinje Phiri contesting for the presidency.\n\nAccording to the ZIFA statutes, the barred candidates have the option to seek remedy from the Court of Arbitrationfor Sports (CAS) in Switzerland.\n\nOutgoing Castle Lager Premier Soccer League (PSL) chairperson Farai Jere has also demanded answers from ZIFA.\n\nI hold high and esteemed offices and do not want my name to be sullied by misconceptions that I do not have 5 0 levels. I therefore kindly ask for a detailed explanation of the considerations that led to this outcome. I would appreciate receiving this information at your earliest convenience, preferably before Christmas, said Jere.\n\n",

I am a strong advocate for womens empowerment and upliftment, and I would never want to be part of anything that diminishes the value of another woman in society.\n\nAs a mother of two beautiful girls, I aspire to raise them in a culture that supports and nurtures their potential as young women. Therefore, I profusely apologize to Mai Titi if I may have offended her in the process.\n\nI deeply celebrate her and the position she holds in our great society. She is an inspiration and a source of strength to many, the statement reads.\n\nThe cyber feud between the two comedians has been ongoing intermittently for several years.\n\n",
