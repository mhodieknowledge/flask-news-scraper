            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nTHERE will not be any discussions on President Emmerson Mnangagwas succession at the upcoming Zanu PF National Peoples conference, the partys Information and Publicity Director Farai Marapira has said.\n\nParty members, supporters and onlookers, intrigued by the ongoing tussle for power between Mnangagwa and his deputy Constantino Chiwenga, were expecting that the issue would be addressed at the upcoming conference to be held in Mutare.\n\nMnangagwas supporters are pushing for him to hang on beyond his constitutionally mandated two terms by extending his second one up to 2030.\n\nThose backing Chiwenga are against such a move and are silently working towards thwarting it and taking over before Mnangagwa hands power to his business partner and close associate, Kudakwashe Tagwirei, as is being pushed for by a considerable section of the party.\n\nSuccession is dealt with at congress; we are not going to congress, we have congress in 2027, we are going to a conference, said Marapira.\n\nThe issue of succession is not an issue within Zanu PF. Most of the purveyors of this succession issue are known not to be members of Zanu PF; they are known not to be within the structures of Zanu PF.\n\nAs Zanu PF, we will not allow a conversation to be imported into the party. We are going to a conference to check on the mandate which we received from the people in 2023.\n\nAlthough party slogans declaring that Mnangagwa will be in power up until 2030 appear to have been silenced, at provincial, district or cell meetings, they continue being chanted, even in the presence of party bigwigs such as Kazembe Kazembe and Owen Ncube in the Midlands Province.\n\nRecent Politburo meetings have been nothing short of explosive, with Chiwenga standing up to Mnangagwa and bringing dossiers to nail his allies and fear abounds that their tussle could result in another coup.\n\nChiwenga, then Commander of Zimbabwes military, led the 2017 coup that installed Mnangagwa as state leader. Although his influence in the army might have been diluted by his decision to join politics, there is fear that he has a lot of sympathisers within its ranks.\n\nMnangagwa has most of Zimbabwes cash-rich individuals, all of whom would be ready to defend his stay to protect their interests.\n\nAdded Marapira: The relationship between the President and his two Vice Presidents is friendly.\n\nAll this talk of animosity, hatred and fighting is a narrow agenda by other parties hoping to bring alarm and despondency within our rank and file.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nFORMER Energy minister Fortune Chasi has called on Zimbabweans to stop blaming Chinese for environmental degradation, arguing that local corruption and weak governance are at the heart of the countrys mining-related ecological damage.\n\nChasi was responding to growing outrage over the ongoing destruction of Christmas Pass Mountain in Mutare, where the Chinese reportedly working in collusion with political elites are accused of tearing apart the landmark for mineral extraction.\n\nThere have been various videos on social media showing the destruction going on in the Christmas Pass Mountain with locals accusing the Chinese of damaging the scenic environment.\n\nThis comes at a time when mountains, monuments and escarpments are being destroyed countrywide by Chinese companies in the mining sector with examples being Boterekwa in Shurugwi, Muvaradonha Wilderness in Muzarabani and now Christmas Pass.\n\nResponding to one of the debates on X, Chasi said while Chinese investors are often vilified for destructive mining practices, the real problem lies with local officials who enable such activities for personal gain.\n\nFor years, we have blamed the Chinese for destroying our environment through mining, but the truth is harder to face, the real culprits are locals.\n\nLocal officials sign the licences, local elites pocket the facilitation fees. Local silence allows rivers to turn into sludge. The Chinese did not corrupt our system, they found it already for sale, Chasi wrote.\n\nThe former energy minister argued that environmental destruction in Zimbabwe reflects a broader governance crisis rather than foreign exploitation alone.\n\nThis isnt a Chinese problem. It is a governance problem. If rules can be bought, someones selling, he added.\n\nEvery destroyed riverbed tells a local story, a signature, a bribe, a blind eye. Foreign miners only exploit the vacuum we created.\n\nBlaming outsiders has become a fashionable, convenient self-deception. Environmental destruction thrives because enforcement is selective and oversight compromised, Chasi wrote.\n\nThe reform we need is not about nationality; it is about integrity.\n\nUntil our institutions stop trading ecological integrity for quick cash, nothing will change. The Chinese did not destroy our mountains and rivers. Our signatures did, he added.\n\n",
