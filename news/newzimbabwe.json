Currently, they earn approximately US$230.\n\nSpeaking to NewZimbabwe.com during the protest, Association of University Teachers (AUT) spokesperson Obvious Vengeyi said state university representatives will meet where their employer will make an offer for them which will inform the next steps.\n\nVengeyi reiterated that lecturers would not return to work until the US$2,250 salary demand is met.\n\nWe are meeting on Tuesday for a process of conciliation. It is ongoing, but it has dragged on for too long.\n\nThe unions are in agreement that it is better to declare a deadlock so that we can obtain a certificate of no settlement across all universities.\n\nThe unions are in agreement that it is better we declare no settlement so that we get a certificate of no settlement across all universities, which means it is most likely that by next week all the state universities would have joined the University of Zimbabwe on the industrial collective job action, Vengeyi said.\n\nUZ legal advisor and senior labour law lecturer Munyaradzi Gwisai, who also addressed the demonstrators, expressed solidarity with the striking lecturers and urged them to stay the course.\n\nWe have sustained the struggle this far, to a point where all other state universities are joining your battalions of resistance. This is not the time to retreat.\n\nWe will be part of the discussions tomorrow, but whatever is offered, we remain resolute, Gwisai said.\n\nMeanwhile, UZ has extended the semester by two weeks.\n\n",

The reintroduction aims to restore lost biodiversity and establish a viable new white rhino metapopulation in Zimbabwes second-largest national park.\n\nThe operation, completed between April and May 2025, included careful selection, transportation, temporary holding, and phased release of rhinos, followed by intensive post-release monitoring. The initiative builds on groundwork laid during the successful reintroduction of black rhinos in 2021.\n\nWith Gonarezhou now home to both species of African rhino, the project marks a major advancement in wildlife conservation in the region, with benefits expected for biodiversity and long-term ecological tourism. Ongoing monitoring and security remain central to ensuring the rhinos survival and the continued success of the reintroduction programme.\n\n",

            "content": "By IOL Sport/ Agencies\n\nTHE power of the Comrades Marathon was on full display late on Sunday afternoon as runners scrambled across the finish line.\n\nWhile all the glory went to the winners who had finished earlier, those who crossed the line later were also proud of their achievements.One of the runners who crossed the line in a time of 09:53 was kwaito star Kabelo Mabalane of TKZee fame, who was running the Comrades for the 13th time.Speaking on the SuperSport broadcast at the finish line, Mabalane remarked on how tough the 2025 race was for him.It was the hardest one. I havent been here since 2019, so today proved to be very difficult. I stopped at 58 km. I quit as Id had enough, but my wife was amazing, and friends of mine [who were on the route] were very encouraging, Mabalane said.He found the strength to carry on, and along the way, crossed paths with Akhona Mkangala, who was also struggling.Akhona helped me to the finish line. We met on the route with 17 km to go. She was crying on the side of the road and I was like, Lets finish together, and ja, we made it. I didnt think Id be here.Despite a difficult run, Mkangala insisted the 2025 Comrades was not her last.Tough day in the office. It started off very well, but I started to struggle at Bill Rowan, but clearly Comrades has its own things. Its an unpredictable race, but well come back again next year, she added.Showing his appreciation for the race organisers, Mabalane said he was impressed by Sundays race, which finished at Peoples Park instead of the Kingsmead cricket ground.To the Comrades Marathon Association: You guys outdid yourselves. Its a spectacular race.Turning to the camera, he said: To you at home, you have to do Comrades at least once in your lifetime. Its going to change your life.Earlier in the day, Tete Dijana crossed the line in a time of five hours, 25 minutes 27 for his third Comrades Marathon title.Dijana out-duelled defending champion Piet Wiersma, to add to the titles he won in 2022 and 2023. Wiersma crossed the line (5:25:33) less than 10 seconds after Dijana. Nikolai Volkov was third in 5:29:42.In the womens race, Gerda Steym claimed a fourth title when she crossed the line in five hours, 51 and 19 seconds. The result confirmed her status as the dominant force in ultra marathon running in South Africa with her third consecutive title, her maiden win came in 2019.This years race had a record prize purse, too, totaling R7,605,000. Thats approximately $427,000 and nearly double last years R4,000,000 ($225,000). First-place finishers earned R874,000 ($49,150), prize money went 10 deep, and there was the potential for course record bonuses and hot spot primes on top of that too. Its certainly the richest prize in ultrarunning, but for comparison, the 2024 New York City Marathon had a total purse of almost $900,000.The Comrades Marathon is the oldest and largest ultramarathon in the world.Steyn was not only the public favorite but also the betting favorite. This years race had legal sports betting, and a day before the start, Steyn had 6-10 odds. Steyn set the down-run record in 2023 in 5:44:54 and, earlier in 2025, won the Two Oceans Marathon for the sixth time in a row.Steyn moved up over the next 5k, but the gap to race leader Mukoloma grew. The pacesetter Mukoloma was 47 seconds up 10k into the race. Dominika Stelmach (Poland) and 2022 winner Alexandra Morozova (Russia) trailed Steyn by 12 seconds in third and fourth. Standout marathoner Irvette van Zyl (South Africa) was sixth in her debut run, and 2024 third-place runner Courtney Olsen (U.S.) was 11th at this point.Mukoloma ran just behind the mens chase group through the Umlaas Road course high point at 20k. Two minutes behind her, Morozova pulled even with Steyn.On a long climb to the halfway point, 2:42 into the race, Steyn made the long-anticipated pass and moved into the lead. Steyn led at halfway, smiling and waving to the crowd, and Mukoloma quietly tucked in behind. The first six women  Steyn, Mukoloma, Morozova, Stelmach, Shelmith Muriuki (Kenya), and van Zyl  all came through halfway in under three hours, a record. Olsen, the top American, was still 11th.Morozova kept the pressure on. At Westville, kilometer 78, Steyns lead over Morozova was down to 2:44. The Russian chaser had cut another 24 seconds over 9k in distance, but she wouldnt get any closer over the final 11k.Gerda Steyn won for the fourth time in 5:51:19, at a significantly faster pace than when shed won in 2023 on a shorter course, and 2022 winner Alexandra Morozova was second in 5:55:56.Shelmith Muriuki made history to become the first ever Black woman to finish on the races podium.2025 Comrades Marathon Womens ResultsGerda Steyn (South Africa)  5:51:19Alexandra Morozova (Russia)  5:55:56Shelmith Muriuki (Kenya)  6:07:56Irvette van Zyl (South Africa)  6:11:35Dominika Stelmach (Poland)  6:12:02Carla Molinaro (U.K.)  6:13:03Jenet Mbhele (South Africa)  6:14:24Caitriona Jennings (Ireland)  6:16:42Courtney Olsen (U.S.)  6:17:48Melissah Gibson (U.K.)  6:19:592025 Comrades Marathon Mens ResultsTete Dijana (South Africa)  5:25:28Piet Wiersma (The Netherlands)  5:25:33Nikolai Volkov (Russia)  5:29:42Edward Mothibi (South Africa)  5:31:41Joseph Manyedi (South Africa)  5:32:09Alex Milne (U.K.)  5:34:08David Gatebe (South Africa)  5:34:30Bongmusa Mthembu (South Africa)  5:35:48Gordon Lesetedi (South Africa)  5:36:22Vasilii Korytkin (Russia)  5:38:59.\n\nWhile all the glory went to the winners who had finished earlier, those who crossed the line later were also proud of their achievements.\n\nOne of the runners who crossed the line in a time of 09:53 was kwaito star Kabelo Mabalane of TKZee fame, who was running the Comrades for the 13th time.Speaking on the SuperSport broadcast at the finish line, Mabalane remarked on how tough the 2025 race was for him.It was the hardest one.

This years race had legal sports betting, and a day before the start, Steyn had 6-10 odds. Steyn set the down-run record in 2023 in 5:44:54 and, earlier in 2025, won the Two Oceans Marathon for the sixth time in a row.Steyn moved up over the next 5k, but the gap to race leader Mukoloma grew. The pacesetter Mukoloma was 47 seconds up 10k into the race. Dominika Stelmach (Poland) and 2022 winner Alexandra Morozova (Russia) trailed Steyn by 12 seconds in third and fourth. Standout marathoner Irvette van Zyl (South Africa) was sixth in her debut run, and 2024 third-place runner Courtney Olsen (U.S.) was 11th at this point.Mukoloma ran just behind the mens chase group through the Umlaas Road course high point at 20k. Two minutes behind her, Morozova pulled even with Steyn.On a long climb to the halfway point, 2:42 into the race, Steyn made the long-anticipated pass and moved into the lead. Steyn led at halfway, smiling and waving to the crowd, and Mukoloma quietly tucked in behind. The first six women  Steyn, Mukoloma, Morozova, Stelmach, Shelmith Muriuki (Kenya), and van Zyl  all came through halfway in under three hours, a record. Olsen, the top American, was still 11th.Morozova kept the pressure on. At Westville, kilometer 78, Steyns lead over Morozova was down to 2:44. The Russian chaser had cut another 24 seconds over 9k in distance, but she wouldnt get any closer over the final 11k.Gerda Steyn won for the fourth time in 5:51:19, at a significantly faster pace than when shed won in 2023 on a shorter course, and 2022 winner Alexandra Morozova was second in 5:55:56.Shelmith Muriuki made history to become the first ever Black woman to finish on the races podium.2025 Comrades Marathon Womens ResultsGerda Steyn (South Africa)  5:51:19Alexandra Morozova (Russia)  5:55:56Shelmith Muriuki (Kenya)  6:07:56Irvette van Zyl (South Africa)  6:11:35Dominika Stelmach (Poland)  6:12:02Carla Molinaro (U.K.)  6:13:03Jenet Mbhele (South Africa)  6:14:24Caitriona Jennings (Ireland)  6:16:42Courtney Olsen (U.S.)  6:17:48Melissah Gibson (U.K.)  6:19:592025 Comrades Marathon Mens ResultsTete Dijana (South Africa)  5:25:28Piet Wiersma (The Netherlands)  5:25:33Nikolai Volkov (Russia)  5:29:42Edward Mothibi (South Africa)  5:31:41Joseph Manyedi (South Africa)  5:32:09Alex Milne (U.K.)  5:34:08David Gatebe (South Africa)  5:34:30Bongmusa Mthembu (South Africa)  5:35:48Gordon Lesetedi (South Africa)  5:36:22Vasilii Korytkin (Russia)  5:38:59.\n\nThe Comrades Marathon is the oldest and largest ultramarathon in the world.\n\nSteyn was not only the public favorite but also the betting favorite.

Mutasa will get his time to play at the tournament.\n\nMarange made the revelation during a post match press conference Saturday after suffering a 2-0 defeat to hosts South Africa.Mutasa, who has the attention of everyone following his last minute inclusion in the squad, was one of the unused substitutes during Saturdays match.He (Nathan) will get his turn, one of my goals is to make sure that at least every player gets a moment to play.I didnt think it was the right time for me to play him, thats why I didnt put him on, said Marange.Mutasa was a last minute inclusion in the Warriors COSAFA
