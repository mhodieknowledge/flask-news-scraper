This includes the Minister of Police and the Minister of Home Affairs, to say that they too must make sure that they are not complacent in these acts of Operation Dudula.\n\nSithole said, the state cannot simply enter peoples homes and start doing raids. They need to have a search warrant, they need to have arrest warrants. In public, they need to have a clear, reasonable suspicion that someone is an undocumented foreign national before they can ask for such identity documents.\n\nOperation Dudula members outside the court said they would not be changing their stance and would do what needs to be done on the streets.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nProphetic Healing and Deliverance (PHD) Ministries founder Walter Magayas wife, Tendai, has been granted US$500 bail by Harare magistrate Marewanazvo Gofa in a case she is accused of fraud.\n\nThe magistrate ruled that the State had failed to present compelling reasons to justify keeping her in custody.\n\nShe is jointly charged with her husband, Walter Magaya, and their company Planet Africa, represented by Tendai Chinguwa. The trio is accused of defrauding members of the public and congregants of PHD Ministries through a bogus housing and investment scheme.\n\nAccording to the State, the alleged scam saw the ministry and its associated companies receiving over US$50,000, R195,000, and ZW$1,000 from victims, none of which has been recovered.\n\nIn her ruling, Magistrate Gofa said that although Tendai Magaya faces a serious charge, this alone could not justify denying her bail.\n\nIn casu, the court finds that the submissions by the accused are plausible, Gofa said. The accused person is not a flight risk. If the State started investigating her in 2023, it shows she has been aware and could have fled to the UK, South Africa, or any other country, but she did not. Denying her bail given this would be tantamount to a travesty of justice; it defies common sense.\n\nThe magistrate added that any fears raised by the State could be adequately addressed through bail conditions.\n\nGofa described her as a good candidate for bail, noting that she has a fixed address and has not shown any intention to abscond. She was ordered to deposit US$500, surrender her passport, report once every two weeks at Waterfalls Police Station, reside at her current address, and not interfere with witnesses.\n\nShe was remanded to November 18, the same date as her husband, Walter Magaya.\n\nProsecutors allege that sometime in 2016, the accused misrepresented that they had acquired land in several areas across the country, including Chishawasha, Norton, Westgate, Mutare, Bulawayo, Kwekwe, Arcturus, Ruwa, Manyame, and Nyatsime, for housing, farming, bee-keeping, and mining projects meant to benefit church members and the public.\n\nDuring a church service that was also broadcast live on Yadah Television, it is alleged that they announced that God had instructed them to help members acquire residential stands and houses, claiming the projects would be managed through Planet Africa and Yadah Connect.\n\nPamphlets featuring Bible verses and images of the purported land and houses were distributed to lure followers.\n\nThe State further alleges that congregants were invited to buy stands and invest in various ventures, including mining and farming projects, with promises of a 50% return after six months. Many members reportedly paid thousands of dollars to the companies and signed memoranda of understanding falsely indicating that the firms had been allocated land by the Ministry of Local Government.\n\nIn 2017, after complaints began surfacing, the accused allegedly sought to restore confidence by entering into a one-season farming contract with former Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor Dr Gideon Gono at New Donnington Farm in Norton. They reportedly took congregants to the property, falsely claiming ownership and that it was ready for stand allocations, even though the farm belonged to Dr Gono and was not for sale.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) has urged businesses to adapt to the emerging reality of sustained inflation decline and adjust their prices in line with the current deflationary trends.\n\nZimbabwes annual inflation, measured in the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency, fell sharply to 32.7% in October from 82.7% in September 2025, with analysts projecting a further drop to between 15% and 20% by December 2025.\n\nQuoting Ben Bernanke, former Chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, CZI noted that deflationary patterns are not artificially induced but stem from underlying economic realities.\n\nThe sources of deflation are not a mystery. Deflation is in almost all cases a side effect of a collapse of aggregate demand a drop in spending so severe that producers must cut prices on an ongoing basis in order to find buyers, the industry lobby group said in its report.\n\nCZI highlighted that ZiG month-on-month inflation has been on a downward trajectory for three consecutive months, dropping to -0.4% in October 2025 from -0.2% in September 2025, the lowest inflation rate recorded so far this year.\n\nHowever, the organisation cautioned that local traders may remain hesitant to reduce prices due to historical fears of economic volatility. It warned that price stickiness, the resistance of market prices to decrease despite changes in the broader economy, could negatively impact market efficiency if left unchecked.\n\nDeflation, the CZI explained, means that goods and services are becoming cheaper in ZiG terms, which benefits consumers in the short term by increasing their purchasing power.\n\nIt also means that consumers who kept ZiG balances in their bank accounts are now able to purchase slightly more goods than what they could have bought in August 2025. If this momentum is maintained, it could significantly enhance confidence in the ZiG, said the CZI.\n\nThe industry body added that the steep fall in inflation largely reflects the fading effects of the September 2024 devaluation, which had sharply driven up the Consumer Price Index (CPI). With month-on-month inflation now well contained, CZI expects further easing in the coming months.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Trk, says that worldwide 90% of cases involving the murder of journalists have gone unresolved amid calls for member states to put in place watertight measures to protect media practitioners.\n\nWhile Zimbabwe has recorded improvements in recent years, as shown by the countrys leap ten places up the Reporters Without Borders 2024 World Press Freedom Index, local journalists still face different types of persecution, including arbitrary arrests, harassment and intimidation prompted by a blend of a hostile legal framework.\n\nJournalists Blessed Mhlanga and Faith Zaba, both from Alpha Media Holdings (AMH), were recently arrested and detained in 2025 on charges of transmitting data messages inciting violence and undermining the authority of or insulting the President, respectively.\n\nAnother UNESCO 2025 report revealed that 63% of women journalists in Zimbabwe have experienced technology-facilitated gender-based violence (TFGBV), including hate speech and cyber harassment, contributing to self-censorship.\n\nOver the past decade, more than one thousand journalists have been killed, in both peacetime and war. In Gaza alone, my Office has documented the killing of 252 journalists since 7 October 2023. And in nearly nine out of ten cases, those who kill journalists around the world have not been brought to justice. This culture of impunity fuels further attacks and undermines freedom of expression, civic space, and ultimately, peace, Trk said.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner made the remarks in a video message to mark the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists, which is commemorated annually on November 2.\n\nHe said journalists who expose injustice and give voice to the voiceless are human rights defenders, yet, across the globe, governments, corporations and criminals threaten, harass and detain them as well as subjecting them to arbitrary detention, to transnational repression, and even murder.\n\nThe UN official said the emergence of new journalisms have been weaponised to amplify abuse, distort reality, and intensify harm including deepfake sexual images, AI-generated defamatory content, and the amplification of misogynistic hate speech through algorithmic tools and bots.\n\nWomen journalists are targeted not only for their reporting, but also because of their gender. They face harassment, sexual violence, and coordinated online attacks designed to silence their voices and strengthen patriarchal norms. Nearly three in four women journalists report that they have been subjected to online violence. This may lead them to self-censor, to leave their jobs, or to live in fear, said Trk.\n\nThe UN official said his office is working to address these challenges by monitoring, documenting and reporting violations against journalists, including online, and advocating with States and technology companies guided by the dimensions of GBV online.\n\nStates have a legal obligation to prevent, investigate, and punish all attacks against journalists  including those that take place online. Technology companies also have responsibilities to respect human rights and to pursue accountability for people who use their platforms and products to perpetrate abuses.\n\nTo end impunity for crimes against journalists, we need stronger, more determined political will, better legal frameworks, and accountability mechanisms that respond to todays digital world, added Trk.\n\n",
