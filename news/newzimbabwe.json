Hes pleaded not guilty.\n\nUnder the racketeering conspiracy charge, prosecutors accusedDiddy in the indictmentof creating a criminal enterprise whose members and associates engaged in, and attempted to engage in, among other crimes, sex trafficking, forced labor, kidnapping, arson, bribery, and obstruction of justice.\n\nIn a letter to the court, the government proposed dropping three theories related to the racketeering conspiracy charge as a way to streamline jury instructions. They still intend to pursue the racketeering charge but removed instructions related to attempted kidnapping, attempted arson and aiding and abetting sex trafficking.\n\nThe Government is no longer planning to proceed on these theories of liability so instructions are no longer necessary, prosecutors wrote in the letter.\n\nFederal prosecutors narrowed the racketeering charge against Diddy in final stage of trial (REUTERS)\n\nAll of the five federal charges against Diddy remain.\n\nThe move comes after Alexandra Shapiro, one of the 55-year-old moguls defense attorneys, passionately argued in court on Tuesdayfor a judgment of acquittal on all counts.She claimed there were deficiencies to each count and then walked through each charge, outlining why it should be dropped.\n\nShapiro argued that two of the three of the governments examples of kidnapping were insufficient.\n\nIn one kidnapping allegation, Capricorn Clark, Diddys former employee, testified about being driven by Diddys then-head of security to a dilapidated building where she was subjected tolie detector tests for five daysin a row. If she failed, a man told her she would be thrown in the East River, she testified. But Shapiro argued there was no evidence that Diddy knew this was happening or that a co-conspirator had kidnapped her.\n\nSean Diddy Combs hugs his lawyer Nicole Westmoreland as he enters the courtroom during Combs sex trafficking trial in New York City, New York, U.S., June 16, 2025. (Reuters)\n\nThe arson allegation stems from a claim by Scott Mescudi, better known as Kid Cudi, thatDiddy firebombed his Porschein early 2012 after he discovered the rapper had dated his longtime girlfriend Cassie Ventura. Shapiro argued that there was no evidence that her client was involved, noting that Mescudi didnt witness the incident. She added that there was female DNA found on the bottle used for the Molotov cocktail.\n\nProsecutors plan to focus the racketeering conspiracy charges instead on proving forced labor and sex trafficking.\n\nThe judge said he would reserve a decision on the defenses motion. Closing arguments are set to begin Thursday morning.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nA quarter of a century after their land was seized during a chaotic land reform programme that made global headlines, a small group of white Zimbabwean farmers have accepted a controversial compensation deal from the government.\n\nOnce the backbone of the countrys agricultural sector, many of them are now elderly, visibly frail, battling illness and financially desperate.\n\nI believe this is the only opportunity. We cant wait 10 years for another deal,  71-year-old Arthur Baisley told the BBC.\n\nStill recuperating from back surgery, Mr Baisley was among those who arrived earlier this year at a conference room in the capital, Harare  some aided by walking sticks and walking frames  to discuss the deal.\n\nThe catch is that these farmers have now been paid only 1% of their total compensation in cash  the rest is being issued as US dollar-denominated treasury bonds that mature in 10 years  with 2% interest paid twice a year.\n\nThe land reform programme, sparked by the invasion of white-owned farms around the country by supporters of the late Robert Mugabe, was launched in 2000 by the then president, who was desperate to shore up political support at the time when Zimbabwe had about 2,500 white farmers owning 4,000 farms  half of the countrys best farmland.\n\nThe seizures became Africas biggest modern-day land revolution, and was meant to redress colonial-era land grabs, when black people were forced to leave their land. But it set the country on a collision path with Western nations  economic sanctions followed, companies exited and the economy collapsed.\n\nThis compensation deal has been pushed by Mugabes successor President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is keen to mend fences. The money being given to the farmers, as stipulated by the constitution, is for infrastructure and improvements to the land  like buildings and dams, not the value of the land itself, which Zimbabwes government insists rightfully belongs to the countrys original inhabitants.\n\nOverall this is estimated to total $3.5bn (2.6bn). However, the recent cash pay-out totalled just $3.1m for 378 farms.\n\nMr Baisley said it was not the best deal but was reasonably fair  and his decision to accept it has come with the realisation that the takeovers cannot be undone.\n\nIt was difficult for my family in the beginning but life goes on, you have to move on, he said, adding that he would start selling some of the bonds immediately to offset medical bills and to care for his sickly parents.\n\nIt is a significant shift, a softening of hard lines previously drawn by both sides.\n\nAFP/Getty Images In 2000 it suited President Robert Mugabe to push land reform to shore up his support in the face of growing opposition\n\nMugabe used to pound the lectern at party rallies saying the white farmers should go to the UK, the former colonial power, for their compensation  although quietly he was paying out select farmers.\n\nThe white farmers meanwhile had insisted on a $10bn full cash settlement. Both sides have settled on the $3.5bn figure.\n\nHowever, unlike Mr Baisley, the majority of white farmers are holding out for a deal which would see all the cash paid upfront.\n\nDeon Theron, who in 2008 was forced off the farm he had bought after independence, leads more than 1,000 farmers who have rejected the offer.\n\nBoxes of his possessions, hastily packed during his departure, still fill the veranda of his Harare home where he told me the deal was not fair as there was no guarantee that the bonds would be honoured in 10 years time.\n\nDeon Therons faction of farmers wants to be paid in cash and feel the UK government should help with negotiations\n\nThe 71-year-old said it was clear that the government did not have the money  and he wanted to see the international community, including the UK, help with negotiations as the government was refusing to budge, or even meet the dissenting group.\n\nThe British cant go and sit in the pavilion and watch whats happening because they are part of it. They are linked with our history. They cant walk away from it, he told the BBC.\n\nIn an agreement brokered in the run-up to independence, the UK was to support land reform financially  but it floundered towards the end of the 1990s when the Labour government came to power and relations soured.\n\nThe need to re-engage Britain on the compensation was the battle cry of many of the war veterans who led the farm invasions. They had fought in the 1970s war against white-minority rule  and felt let down by the slow pace of land reform following independence.\n\nBut like the white farmers, the war veterans are also split over the governments handling of the compensation.\n\nGodfrey Gurira is part of a group of war veterans suing the government  saying the compensation agreed for white farmers is too much at a time of economic hardship\n\nOne faction is suing the government for clandestinely agreeing to pay $3.5bn in compensation, saying the offer should have been agreed in parliament.\n\nOne of its leaders, Godfrey Gurira, said that given the myriad economic challenges cash-strapped Zimbabwe faced, it should not have prioritised white farmers.\n\nIts such a colossal amount for a nation of our size. People are suffering they can hardly make ends meet, the hospitals have nothing, then we have the luxury to pay $3.5bn. In our opinion its an unnecessary act of appeasement, he told the BBC.\n\nA second lawsuit challenges an aspect of a new land policy that demands that new farmers pay for the land in order to obtain title deeds to own the land outright.\n\nIn the wake of the redistribution, the 250,000 people who replaced the 2,500 white farmers were only entitled to 99-year leases. However this meant it was near-impossible for them to get bank loans as their security of tenure was not guaranteed.\n\nLast year, the government said farmers could apply to own their land outright  with title deeds  but they needed to pay between $100 and $500 per hectare (2.47 acres).\n\nThat money will go towards the compensation deal to white farmers, according to the government.\n\nThose challenging this say forcing black farmers to effectively buy back the land contradicts the law.\n\nAnd the black farmers themselves are divided over the issue.\n\nThe land reform programme has had mixed results. Many new farmers did not have the skills, the finances and labour to farm successfully. But the countrys agricultural sector is now rebounding with pockets of successful farmers.\n\nIn 2002, Solomon Ganye arrived on a bicycle to receive a 20-hectare bare piece of land in Harare South.\n\nIt was part of the sprawling 2,700-hectare farm that had been divided among 77 people.\n\nHe found the initial years a struggle  suffering from a lack of finances and climate shocks. But slowly through Chinese money ploughed into the tobacco sector, and after handing the business over to his sons  both agriculture graduates in their 20s  things have improved.\n\nThey have built an enviable enterprise with 200 permanent workers, and have expanded into dairy and livestock farming. They are applying for the title deeds of their land and have even acquired more in recent years from the government.\n\nAaron Ganye, his oldest son, told the BBC that without the land reform programme, his family would probably not have been able to buy a farm because in the past the structure of ownership saw vast tracts of land being held by a single family.\n\nIm very happy because to be honest weve taken farming to another level because now were living a good life through farming. Were doing more than what the white guys were doing in terms of quality of tobacco and the leaf is good, the 25-year-old said proudly.\n\nWeve invested in technology. Its not easy. Im now motivating more farmers to do good work here, he said.\n\nHe does believe that new farmers should contribute to compensation payments but based on the value of infrastructure they inherited.\n\nOn the political front, tensions are also easing  and the UK government no longer has any Zimbabwean on its sanction list having recently delisted four military and government officials it had accused of human rights abuses.\n\nThe UKs Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office told the BBC this was because they were no longer in the positions they held at the time they were added to the list in 2021.\n\nNonetheless, it is a significant development, marking the end of more than 20 years of sanctions against Zimbabwe.\n\nThe country now hopes that the farmers compensation issue can be properly sorted out to get Western support for ongoing talks on restructuring its massive foreign debt.\n\nThere is no question that 25 years on, calm has returned to almost all farming fronts.\n\nAgriculture is rebounding, this year farmers have sold over 300,000 tonnes of tobacco at auction  the highest tobacco production ever.\n\nBut compromise is needed on all sides for the country to fully jump over the hurdle of land reform and its fallout.\n\n",

He cannot wrap his head round why his church could countenance the de-spiritualizing of the spiritual.\n\nOur client contends that the misuse of the SDA pulpit on the holy Sabbath of the Lord is a violation and negation of the SID Working Policy, the ZEUC Constitution, the EZC Constitution, the SDA Church Manual as well the Holy Scriptures to whose authority the church unerringly yields, added Mpofu.\n\nTagwireiwho was recently elevated to ZANU PFs Central Committee, is rumoured to be eyeing for the countrys presidency.

            "content": "Xinhua\n\nLocated in the northwestern region of Harare, Zimbabwes capital, the 500-hectare Monavale Vlei remains a well-protected wetland that offers a serene retreat for nature enthusiasts, thanks to the dedicated efforts of a local conservation group.\n\nAs wetlands in Harare face challenges from urban development, the Monavale wetland remains well-preserved, said Jimmy Muropa, an officer with the Conservation Society of Monavale (COSMO), a community organization established to protect and restore the Monavale wetland.\n\nThe wetlands protected and thriving ecosystem makes it a haven for many bird species, including migratory birds, said Muropa. For us, birds are a very good indicator of the healthy nature of any ecosystem. To protect these species, we have to protect this kind of habitat.\n\nSince 2005, Muropa has worked with COSMO to restore the wetland and protect it from threats such as waste dumping and informal agriculture. His responsibilities also include the removal of alien plant species to ensure that the area remains a healthy ecosystem.\n\nDespite being surrounded by residential suburbs, the wetland has become home to various mammals such as the slender mongoose, large grey mongoose, side-striped jackal, bush pig, otters and duikers, among others.\n\nThe Monavale wetland is crucial to Zimbabwes ecosystems, as it also forms part of a network of wetlands in the Manyame catchment basin, which is the primary source of water for the city of Harare and its surrounding satellite towns.\n\nMonavale Vlei is a unique wetland that physically demonstrates what Harares headwater wetland ecosystems look like. These are our water sources, the beginnings of our streams and rivers. Currently, Monavale Vlei, the core area, is a perfect example of what a true headwater wetland ecosystem looks like  well conserved and preserved, Muropa said.\n\nAs wetlands in Harare dwindle due to human activities, Muropa said there is a need to push for wetland protection, as they play a vital role in water filtration, flood control, carbon sequestration, and biodiversity support.\n\nWetlands are more like the lungs and the kidneys of the cities, Muropa said, noting that the capitals water supply has been degraded due to the loss and degradation of wetlands.\n\nAs Zimbabwe prepares to host the 15th meeting of the Conference of the Contracting Parties to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands in the resort city of Victoria Falls from July 23 to 31, the importance of preserving wetlands has taken center stage.\n\nZimbabwe will hold the Ramsar presidency for the next three years. So the worlds eyes are actually on us, so we should be conserving our wetlands, Muropa said.\n\nTo raise awareness about wetland conservation, Muropa has organized educational walks, led outreach programs, engaged in advocacy and collaborated with relevant authorities.\n\nFollowing a recent tour of the Monavale wetland, Precious Chizema, a member of the Restore Eden Initiative, a movement launched by Zimbabwean youths with a focus on environmental conservation and sustainable development, said wetlands are also important from a cultural perspective.\n\nWe learnt that in the wetlands we can also find some trees and other plants that will help us with natural medicines, like the herbs that our great-grandfathers and mothers used, she added.\n\n",
