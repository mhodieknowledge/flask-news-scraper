We were given a directive that we must implement as we leave this room.\n\nIn every local authority we must, with immediate effect, deal with the issues of littering. I know we need support of Home Affairs and ZRP but with the resources that we have with the municipal police, we should be able to enforce our by-laws and make sure that people clean wherever they are operating, said Garwe.\n\nSome major cities in Zimbabwe have been struggling to manage refuse collection and maintain a semblance of cleanliness.\n\nHarare has become the epitome of this struggle, with garbage piling up in residential areas such as Mbare.\n\nDespite the involvement of a private company, Geo Pomona, in handling garbage collection in Harare, council has failed to eliminate the waste problem in the city.\n\n",

Authorities say the pronouncements were false, unlawful, and intended to cause psychological harm to foreign nationals and economic damage to Zimbabwe.Later the same day, Mandizvidza allegedly misled Chief Inspector Fidios Chiteure into believing he had been authorised by a senior commissioner to use a Ford Ranger, registration number ZRP 1033R.The vehicle was driven to Waerera village in Bindura, where it was later recovered.On August 14, 2025, the accused allegedly uploaded another video repeating his claim to be the ZRP commander, this time naming Commissioner General Stephen Mutamba  the actual police chief  in what the State says was a deliberate bid to sow disaffection among serving officers.Nyazamba warned the court that if granted bail, Mandizvidza was highly likely to delete the YouTube account he used, thereby destroying crucial evidence.Mandizvidza remains in custody as the court considers the States opposition to bail.He will be back in court on August 18.Vakayi Chikwekwe is presiding over the case while Anesu Chirenje is prosecuting.\n\nHe also faces charges of fraudulently using a police vehicle.\n\nSimbarashe Mandizvidza, 35, a non-commissioned officer stationed at Police General Headquarters Salaries Services Bureau Liaison Office, faces three charges  causing disaffection among the police, procuring the use of a motor vehicle by fraud, and transmitting false data messages intending to cause harm.He was remanded in custody after he told court he needed to get legal representation.In his affidavit, the Investigation Officer Edmore Nyazamba opposed bail, warning that Mandizvidzas release would undermine and jeopardise the objectives and proper functioning of the criminal justice system.The magnitude of the sentence likely to be passed upon conviction will induce him to abscond The sense of peace and security of foreign investors in Zimbabwe will be undermined and prejudiced by release of the accused.The State alleges that on August 13, 2025, Mandizvidza used his Canon 250D camera at his official residence in Hatfield Police Camp to record a video, later uploaded to his YouTube channel Gondo Harishaye, in which he claimed to have taken over command of the Zimbabwe Republic Police and announced that all Chinese nationals residing and doing business in Zimbabwe must leave within 48 hours.He also declared that the ZRP Traffic Section was temporarily disbanded.
