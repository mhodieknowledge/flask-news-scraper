The surge has boosted renminbi use in cross-border deals and reserve holdings.\n\nBeyond Egypt, where the central banks recently signed agreements to deepen yuan usage in trade and investment, China has steadily advanced its currency diplomacy across Africa.\n\nAs early as 2015, South Africa signed a 30 billion yuan swap deal to improve trade liquidity. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) explained that the three-year agreement was designed to facilitate trade and investment and serve as a buffer for short-term balance of payment pressures.\n\nEarlier this year, Nigeria and China renewed their bilateral currency swap deal valued at 15 billion yuan (3.19 trillion), three years after the initial agreement expired.\n\nThe Peoples Bank of China said the renewed three-year pact aims to promote bilateral trade and investment facilitation.\n\nIn Angola, a key oil supplier to China, the yuan is increasingly being used in energy and infrastructure transactions, with the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), Chinas alternative to SWIFT, being integrated into the financial system.\n\nLauren Johnston, a senior research fellow at the AustChina Institute and China-Africa expert, told the South China Morning Post that Africa offers a strategic testbed for Beijings currency goals.\n\nAfrica is a continent where trade with China is important, but it is also one where many countries struggle to access sufficient foreign currencies such as the euro or US dollar, she noted.\n\nJohnston added, For China, there may be a chance to test the internationalisation of the RMB via a few countries in Africa first, where volumes might be small on a global scale and Chinas footprint in the region relatively large.\n\nThese efforts mark a broader rebalancing of global financial influence, with China positioning the yuan as a viable alternative in Africas evolving economic landscape.\n\n",

Sales volumes fell 19% in the first quarter, grew 24% in the second, rose 8% in the third, before slipping 3% in the final quarter.\n\nThe reason?\n\nAuthorities controlled the in-store exchange rate throughout the year, whereas informal players used higher exchange rates aligned with the parallel market.\n\nThis allowed informal traders to offer lower prices in USD, bleeding supermarkets across the market, including OK Zim and Spar.\n\nThat changed earlier this year when the government repealed SI 81A through SI 34 of 2025. USD sales, which made up just 23% of total sales last year, have now crawled up to 32%.\n\nUnit sales volumes rose by 8%, reflecting sustained consumer demand, Pick n Pay says.\n\nLast year, Pick n Pay shut down three stores in Chegutu, Harare Street and Southwold. It opened one in Hogerty Hill.\n\nThe company is back in expansion mode. A new branch opened in Shurugwi, and more are on the way. The focus is on high-potential stores in mining towns, liquor category development, and fixing supply chains for remote areas.\n\nTheres also a big move coming in Bulawayo. Pick n Pays property arm plans to develop what it calls the citys largest mall of its kind, with over 220 small shops, food outlets and office space. Says the company: The tenant mix will include a combination of smaller businesses, which generate higher rental yields, and key anchor tenants such as TM Pick n Pay and KFC.\n\n",
