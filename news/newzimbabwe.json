            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nBREAD prices are set to go up starting November 1, 2025, NewZimbabwe.com has learnt.\n\nThe increase comes as a result of a controversial Statutory Instrument (SI) 87 of 2025, which was gazetted by Industry and Commerce Minister Mangaliso Ndhlovu last month.The SI imposed a statutory payment into the Agriculture Revolving Fund on all millers, a move that they warned could result in negative inflationary pressures.Recommendations to set it aside were ignored.Failure to do so, as a result, is set to hike bread prices by not less than 4% on the retailers side according to the National Bakers Association of Zimbabwe (NBAZ) and Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ).Maize meal, stock feed, and other related products are likely to see prices go up.The NBAZ wishes to reiterate that the sector does not have capacity to take any increases in input costs, without compromising business viability, reads a letter to Ndhlovu from NBAZ, dated October 24, 2025.Bread flour accounts for approximately 43% of the total bread production cost, if a 4% increase in bread flour is permitted, it will translate to a 2 cents increase per cost of producing a loaf, resulting in an increase in the wholesale price of bread effective on the day on which the flour price is increased.The communicated increase in flour price, compounded with the other input cost escalations will result in an overall 5 cents per loaf pass-through effect to the retailer, most likely taking the retail price of bread, above the US$1 psychological benchmark, effective 1 November 2025.Despite fuel price increases, shortages of electricity and haphazard distribution, bread prices have remained at generally a dollar across the country.Their price hike could have a ripple effect whose inflationary impact might bring back memories of the late 2000s when prices changed by the hour.GMAZ, which according to another letter in NewZimbabwe.coms possession conceded defeat upon failure to scrap the SI, has already communicated the increase to the government.Regrettably, we have failed to successfully lobby for this SI to be reversed and have no option but to comply with it, reads a letter sent to Ndhlovu dated 23 October and copied to Lands and Agriculture Minister Anxious Masuka, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube, the presidents office, and the NBAZ.Accordingly, guided by the Audit Opinion we sought, we will be making provisions of the statutory payment imposed in our costings.Therefore, the price of bread flour (and other types of flour) will be increasing by circa 4% with effect from 1 November 2025.\n\nThe increase comes as a result of a controversial Statutory Instrument (SI) 87 of 2025, which was gazetted by Industry and Commerce

This will allow families to find closure as they now have the opportunity to bury their loved ones.\n\nSouth Africas Department of Transport has previously confirmed that the crash was caused by a combination of speeding, mechanical failure, and overloading.\n\nA preliminary report into the crash revealed that the bus was overloaded by 23 passengers, half of its brakes were defective, and the driver was travelling at an unsafe speed along a steep, winding mountain pass.\n\nTransport Minister Barbara Creecy and her deputy, Mkhuleko Hlengwa, have officially received the report, which was compiled by the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC).\n\nAccording to the RTMC, a major contributing factor was the drivers excessive speed for the conditions along the mountain descent.\n\n",

In the horticulture sector, the areas of interest include blueberries, chilies, avocados, and macadamia nuts, said Midzi.He noted that with Chinas zero-tariff policy for African exports, Zimbabwe aims to further tap into the Chinese market for locally produced goods.Looking at the Chinese market, we are also aiming to promote leather products, especially exotic leather. We are also looking to promote arts and crafts from Zimbabwe, the horticultural products, and the processed foods, said Midzi.Zimbabwe is additionally seeking to export heritage-based and value-added products such as baobab wine, baobab powder, and essential oils derived from indigenous resources.We have got baobab seed oil, we have got Marula oil, which are new products that are being developed in Zimbabwe, which we are looking to promote, and we believe the Chinese market is the right market, whether for further value additions into cosmeceuticals or even just consumption by the Chinese market, he said.As Zimbabwe works to strengthen its horticulture sector, businesses in blueberry production will be represented at the expo, following the signing of a blueberry export protocol during President Emmerson Mnangagwas visit to China in September.The protocol is only fairly new, but we are hoping to generate interest so that we can get information on potential buyers in China of blueberries so that we can bring back that information to the Zimbabwean growers and promote blueberry exports to China, said Midzi, adding that Zimbabwe is also pursuing export protocols for additional horticultural products, including citrus and avocados.\n\nKupakwashe Midzi, client advisor in the export development department at ZimTrade, Zimbabwes trade promotion agency, said about 15 companies from sectors including construction, horticulture, minerals, arts and crafts, and essential oils will participate in the expo, slated for Nov. 5 in Shanghai.\n\nWhat we are expecting to benefit from CIIE is getting more business deals, generating business leads, and getting businesses or companies in China that are interested in not only buying products from Zimbabwe, but also investing in the production of the products locally, said Midzi in a recent interview with Xinhua.He said the CIIE has, over the years, served as a key platform to showcase Zimbabwean products and expand their visibility in the vast Chinese market.We are looking forward to gaining a lot of traction from the Chinese businesses as well as potential buyers in what Zimbabwe has to offer.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nBUSINESS couple Clark Clever Makoni and Beverly Aisha Ndonda Makoni, accused of defrauding former Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor Gideon Gono, have approached the High Court seeking to overturn a ruling by Regional Magistrate Stanford Mambanje, which dismissed their application for discharge.\n\nIn their court papers, the couple accuses the magistrate of grossly misdirecting himself and creating new charges by placing them on their defence despite what they say is a State case barren of evidence.They cite Mambanje and Prosecutor General Loice Matanda-Moyo as first and second respondents respectively.The first respondent grossly misdirected himself by ignoring that neither the main nor the alternative charge disclosed a valid offence, the application reads.The courts reasoning was so outrageous in its defiance of logic that no sensible court applying its mind could have arrived at it.The Makonis, represented by Admire Rubaya of Rubaya and Chatambudza Legal Practitioners, argue that their prosecution is a failed fishing expedition.The State is acting like a soccer player who has dived at the centre circle of a soccer pitch and clamouring to the referee to be awarded a penalty. This is clearly unacceptable and untenable, the application states.The couple is jointly charged with fraud and corruptly using a false document after allegedly altering company directorship details of Valley Lodge (Pvt) Ltd in 2017. The State alleges they removed Ayoob Omar and Mohammed Hussein Omar as directors and replaced them with their own names to take control of the lodges accounts.But the applicants say the State failed to prove any misrepresentation, intent, or prejudice.There is no way the accused persons can be placed onto the defence in circumstances where the essential elements of the offence of fraud have not been set out, they said.As it stands, the charge of fraud is barren as it lacks the essential averments required to make it a valid one.They also accused the magistrate of overstepping his judicial role.This Honourable Court has no discretion to usurp the States responsibilities as the dominus litis and proceed to recreate new particulars and averments for the alleged charge of fraud, the couple argued.It must avoid the temptation of making a bidding for the State. It laid its bed, it must lie on it.The couple further claims the States witnesses exonerated them by confirming that Valley Lodges directorship had not changed since 2009, contradicting the fraud allegations.There was a clear concession by all the critical witnesses that the directors of Valley Lodge (Pvt) Ltd have remained the same as from 2009 till today, they submitted. This concession clearly exonerated the accused persons.They also argue the State failed to prove that they withdrew any funds from the lodges bank account, allegedly amounting to US$70,000.The State never led any evidence showing that there was any withdrawal from the account in question, the defence stated. There were no withdrawal slips nor any documentary evidence to that effect.Makoni and Ndonda further challenge the authenticity of the alleged fraudulent CR14 form, saying it was never proven to have been authored or signed by them.None of the witnesses said they saw any of the accused creating or signing the alleged CR14 in issue. The State failed to prove as a matter of fact that the accused authored the document, they said.They dismissed the case as baseless.A criminal trial is not a fishing expedition. The accused persons should not be put to their defence hoping that along the way they will convict themselves out of their own mouths. This is a classical failed fishing expedition where the State has failed to even catch a small frog or a kapenta.The couple wants the High Court to review and set aside Mambanjes ruling and substitute it with a verdict of not guilty, arguing that the magistrates decision was rendered without jurisdiction and cannot stand.The matter is yet to be heard.\n\nIn their court papers, the couple accuses the magistrate of grossly misdirecting himself and creating new charges by placing them on their defence despite what they say is a State case barren of evidence.\n\nThey cite Mambanje and Prosecutor General Loice Matanda-Moyo as first and second respondents respectively.The first respondent grossly misdirected himself by ignoring that neither the main nor the alternative charge disclosed a valid offence, the application reads.The courts reasoning was so outrageous in its defiance of logic that no sensible court applying its mind could have arrived at it.The Makonis, represented by Admire Rubaya of Rubaya and Chatambudza Legal Practitioners, argue that their prosecution is a failed fishing expedition.The State is acting like a soccer player who has dived at the centre circle of a soccer pitch and clamouring to the referee to be awarded a penalty.

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nGOVERNMENT has set aside nearly US$197,000 to cover the medical and repatriation costs for Zimbabwean victims of the Limpopo bus accident, which killed 44.\n\nThe victims, Zimbabweans and Malawians, were travelling back home when the DNC bus veered off the N1 North near Louis Trichardt on 13 October, killing 43 passengers and injuring 40 others, the victims. One more person succumbed to injuries in the hospital, bringing the death toll to 44.\n\n36 Zimbabweans died and 13 remain hospitalised in South Africa, with three in a critical condition.\n\nPreliminary investigations have revealed that the accident was due to brake failure and overloading of the bus, which was carrying 91 passengers with only a 62-seater capacity.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has since declared the bus accident a national disaster.\n\nPresenting a ministerial statement in the National Assembly recently, the Deputy Minister of Local Government and Public Works, Benjamin Kabikira, said the repatriation will be conducted in batches beginning on Friday.\n\nThe positive identification of all deceased was completed on the 20th of October, 2025, with the ZRP forensic team present to assist with the fingerprint screening and verification. In cases involving deceased children, DNA samples were collected from both the deceased and their next of kin for accurate identification.\n\nThen, on the death registration and documentation, all required documentation, including the death certificates and burial orders, are being processed to facilitate repatriation.\n\nThe repatriation to Zimbabwe is anticipated to begin in batches from Friday, 24th October 2025, pending the completion of all formal processes. A mass memorial service will be held in Beitbridge when the bodies arrive in Zimbabwe, said Kabikira.\n\nKabikira added that US$197,000 has been set aside to assist the victims.\n\nSecondly, we have dispatched a bus with next of kin or relatives from the National Disaster Management Centre, Harare, to the Beitbridge route to South Africa, for identification of the bodies. Zimbabwean nationals, that is next of kin without valid passports, were granted temporary passage into South Africa for the sole purpose of identifying the deceased.\n\nA list of names for the next of kin and national IDs was submitted to South African Immigration in advance to ensure smooth border processing. As a Ministry, post mortems were completed on Friday, the 17th of October, 2025 and the physical identification was also completed as of 20 October at Siloam Hospital.\n\nAs an intervention, the department of Civil Protection requested the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development and Zim Borders for a waiver of border charges for the hearses and bus carrying the bodies and families of the bereaved. The budget for intervention and coordination of the disaster is as follows: We are anticipating using a total amount of US$197,940 or ZWG5,340,930. 3 in the coordination and intervention of the disaster, said Kabikira.\n\n",
