arrested early Friday morning when a car he was travelling in was stopped, searched and discovered to have 26 blasting cartridges and 15 capped fuse connectors; which are both forms of explosives.Images of him in handcuffs were plastered over the internet, with Zanu PF acolytes celebrating it like a win.He is being held at Pretoria Central and expected to appear in court on Monday.His South African lawyer Eric Mabuza said Sikhala was denying any knowledge of the crime while the South African Police Service (SAPS) had already made efforts to review footage at a mall the former legislator visited earlier.Sikhala was said to have been arrested after going for dinner with one of his uncles (also in police custody).It is an allegation he denies, Mabuza told state broadcaster SABC after meeting with Sikhala.He says that this is foul play because when he went out with his uncle for dinner he was not carrying any explosives but those were found as he was driving out.He said he did not come here for explosives but for medical attention.Indeed, Sikhala has been frequenting South Africa for medical help after spending over 500 days in pretrial detention before being released without charge.He was not just kept under the worst conditions but subjected to inhumane treatment over the entire period, which not only cost him his law firm but almost derailed his political career.Jacob Ngarivhume, another opposition figure in Zimbabwean politics described the explosives as having been planted in a post on X that confirmed that his family had been made aware.The pressure group he leads, the National Democratic Working Group said it suspected foul play.\n\nSikhala was arrested early Friday morning when a car he was travelling in was stopped, searched

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA 23-year-old man from Chiredzi, who fatally stabbed a villager after mistaking him for one of his attackers, has been jailed for five years.\n\nJustice Christopher Dube-Banda sitting at the Hight Court at Masvingo convicted Simbarashe Tapera of culpable homicide after he pleaded guilty to the lesser charge, escaping a possible murder conviction.The court heard that on December 22, 2024, Tapera fatally stabbed Edwin Tapera, aged 24, at Murambi village, Chief Nhema in Zaka.According to an agreed statement of facts, the deceased had earlier been assaulted by a group of young men while walking home from Mutembwa business centre around 7pm.Court heard that, as the assailants fled, the accused arrived at the scene with his girlfriend. Mistaken for one of the attackers, he was grabbed by the collar by the deceased, who was holding a stick. In response, Simbarashe drew a knife and stabbed the deceased once in the chest before fleeing.The judge said the accused acted negligently.At the time the accused stabbed the deceased, an attack on him was imminent. However, the means he used to avert the attack were not reasonable in the circumstances, he said.In stabbing the deceased in the manner he did, a reasonable man placed in the same circumstances as the accused would have foreseen the possibility of death and guarded against it. The accused was negligent, and it was his negligence that led to the death of the deceased.The judge noted that although the deceased was the aggressor, the accuseds reaction was excessive and unjustified.The fact is that the accused was not part of the group that harassed the deceased and his companions. He just found himself in a controversy he had nothing to do with; these factors reduce his moral blameworthiness.He, however, stressed that the sanctity of life must be upheld. Society frowns upon a person who, by his violent conduct, causes the death of another human being. The courts must send a loud and clear message that causing the death, albeit negligently, of a fellow human being will not be tolerated, the judge said.The court also considered the Victim Impact Statement, which highlighted the emotional and financial suffering endured by the deceaseds family.Tapera, a first offender and father of one, was sentenced to five years in prison, with one year suspended for five years on condition of good behaviour.The accused, though a young first offender, jumped into crime from the deep end, and he must contend with the consequences.

This was negligence of the highest degree, said Justice Dube-Banda.\n\nThe judge noted that although the deceased was the aggressor, the accuseds reaction was excessive and unjustified.\n\nThe fact is that the accused was not part of the group that harassed the deceased and his companions.
