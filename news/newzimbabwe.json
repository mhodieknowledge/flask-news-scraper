            "content": "By Tariro Mugadza\n\nIts been just over a week since I attended Zimfest, having had my first experience of the festival in 2007 when I was in a pushchair under a year old, and Im already ready to grab tickets for the next one. Alongside the overwhelming joy and warmth this years event left me with, Ive also been carrying a deep sense that I experienced something truly meaningful, something far beyond just having fun. It stirred something within me, strengthening my connection to my roots and heritage. After all, its not every day that I get to be among my people, especially beyond the familiar walls of my home.\n\nThis was my second time inviting non-Zimbabwean friends to Zimfest, and it gifted me with an even deeper appreciation for my culture and heritage. Witnessing their genuine curiosity, enthusiasm, and respect for Zimbabwean culture was profoundly moving. Seeing them light up with joy and admiration for the very things I grew up loving is something I will never forget.\n\nWhether they were drooling over the culinary delights, like chakalaka and boerewors (shoutout to Just James MCR for that delicious lunch!), or captivated by the visual brilliance of Zimbabweans showing up and showing out in style, the day was filled with heart-warming moments and an overwhelming sense of pride.\n\nReflecting on their experience at this years Zimfest, my friends shared some powerful sentiments. Anton, who is UK-born and half-British, half-German, said, Im not even from Zimbabwe, and it made me feel more connected to its culture.Fikunmi, who is Black, Yoruba, and migrated from Nigeria to the UK at the age of three, said, Going to Zimfest allowed me to connect to a culture that wasnt my own, yet I still felt welcomed, like an honorary Zimbabwean.\n\nMy lunch bought from the Just James MCR Stall at Zimfest\n\nFinding a Sense of Identity and Belonging\n\nLiving in the Diaspora, I know firsthand that it is simply not possible to constantly return home or physically engage with your people. This is where festivals like Zimfest step in by providingthe much-needed opportunity to be amongst your people, to fully embrace and express your native identity and to rejoice in a common sense of cultural pride.\n\nHere in the diaspora, the culture I was raised withfrom the daily home-cooked meals to the dcor adorning our walls, from the music blasting during ourgochi gochiand braais in the back garden to the spirited family games of Crazy Eightsdoes not reflect the culture I encounter the moment I step outside my front door.\n\nBack home, stepping out and being surrounded by your own people is part of everyday life. But here, in the diaspora, those moments are rareand therefore deeply precious. This is especially true for those of us who grew up or lived in predominantly white areas, in places weve never truly identified with and perhaps never will. In spaces where, for years and sometimes even now, simply seeing another Black person in town becomes a moment of excitement.\n\nTinaye, a second-generation Zimbabwean migrant who was raised in South Africa and moved to the UK for boarding school at the age of 12, attended Zimfest for the first time this year. She commented: Zimfest is a reminder of how much community you can find in the UK being a Zimbabwean andI find that important as someone who has gone to predominantly white schools.\n\nFor, as a second-generation migrant, I am one with those whom I simply do not have immediate access to. Yet, at Zimfest, there is that precious opportunity to truly feel that strong, unwavering power of unity and Ubuntu as I join with my community.\n\nRuvarashe, a second-generation Zimbabwean migrant born and raised in the UK, commented on Zimfest as a powerful way to connect with my roots. Exploring the distinction between first-generation and second-generation migrants, she stated: While first-generation migrants carry lived memories of home, I often navigate identity through culture, music and community. Zimfest helps bridge that gap by providing a space dedicated to belonging, pride and a deeper understanding of my heritage. Alongside the inherent sense of belonging that comes along with attending Zimfest, there is the more personal, individual aspects of being able to walk around comfortably knowing that I will not stand out or receive looks of fear or judgement simply on the basis of skin colour alone.\n\nTinaye further stated: Its quite easy to feel isolated and feel like youre out of place and losing your culture.But, when youre surrounded by people and hearing your language even though you are not in your country, you realise that you are not alone. Zimfest is empowering in that, I know that guaranteed for at least one day of the year, I will be able to evade the everyday sense of minority to exist within the majority on the Zimfest grounds  just like kumusha.\n\nCommenting on her experience as an African migrant living in the Diaspora, my friend Fikunmi further stated: It was hard fitting into British culture and often I felt alone, but being at Zimfest helped me know that I am not alone, and even with people outside of my own culture I have a family.\n\nLooking Back and Looking Forward\n\nThe establishment and organisation of such a significant and meaningful celebration of culture and identity is far from a lacklustre trick which can be pulled together overnight but rather a process of resilience, dedication, determination and reflection.\n\nStuck in a mesmerising haze of Zimfest nostalgia, I became curious to find out more about how and why Zimfest has become such a noteworthy event on both a personal level, for me as a second-generation Zimbabwean migrant living in the Diaspora, and on a community level for the thousands of people I join with each year. This led me to ask a representative from the Zimfest organising team to reflect on the main motivations for Zimfest, the vision for Zimfest itself and the vision for the generations to come:\n\nAlthough gone are the days of seeing Mtukudzi (MHSRIEP)  the first high-profile musician to play at Zimfest  and Mukanya onstage, there are so many magnificent ways Zimfest has continued to improve over the years since its humble beginnings as a come together without the focus on music that we appreciate nowadays. This includes the innovation of the festival to include the younger generation by adding features such as the Fun Fair and the Amapiano tent. Tinaye further commented: Its great to see so many young Zimbabweans, South Africans and Africans embracing their culture and keeping up with the mainstream artistry of Zimbabwe even though we do not live there.\n\nPersonally, I loved how the layout of Zimfest improved this year, with the Fun Fair area becoming more central. Despite being too old for the trampolines, it was a delight to discover that I still qualified to ride the Ferris wheel. What a superb way to soak in the views at Zimfest! I personally cannot wait to try out the swing ride that made its first appearance this year, next year!\n\nA view of the Zimfest crowds from the ferris wheel\n\nThe Zimfest organisers representative commenting on Zimfests plans to become even bigger and fresher said: To enhance Zimfest, the plan includes featuring diverse, internationally acclaimed artists and introducing new activities like dance sessions and cultural exhibitions for various age groups. A hybrid experience with virtual attendance will attract a global audience. By gathering continuous attendee feedback, Zimfest aims to innovate and remain relevant, ultimately creating an inclusive celebration that fosters unity and pride in cultural heritage.\n\nI have always felt included at Zimfest and appreciated it as a family festival. However, this year, there were some community concerns raised about Zimfest remaining as family friendly and inclusive as previous years. With respect to these concerns, the Zimfest organising team representative expressed: Zimfest aims to create a family-friendly atmosphere by enhancing its appeal for all ages. Key initiatives include:\n\nCommunity Business Ethics\n\nIt is thanks to Black Zimbabwean-owned businesses such as Nyama Butchery (now closed) in Birmingham and Mwanaka Fresh Farm Foods in Walsall and local businesses such as Palmers in Milton Keynes and Joseph Morris Butchers that I have grown up with the gap between life in the Diaspora and lifekumushamore bridged. Growing up, stepping through the PVC strip curtains of the Nyama butchery  donned the maputi shop by either me or my sister and eventually the whole household  felt like arriving at Narnia itself. It is here that I developed my lifelong love for lemon creams and Mazoes cream soda. In August 2023, I was blessed to be invited to celebrate the renowned Mwanaka Fresh Farm Foods 20+ years of farming in Cambridge. The day was deeply emotional and inspiring to see such great success and be told such poignant stories within my very own community.\n\nFrom the small stores selling wonders beaming with Zimbabwean pride, such as gorgeous jewellery (shoutout to Rungano from Paper Pieces for the beautiful, sustainable jewellery I bought last year), stylish Zimbabwean apparel and mouth-watering snacks, to the major sponsors, such as World Remit and Diaspora Insurance, the message is clear: it is fundamental that we as Black Africans, support Black owned and African owned businesses. The money spent here has so much more significance and promotes far more ethical business practices than a quick order from the likes of Shein and Temu. For example, in the UK, it is a reality that the Black British community has a spending power of 300 billion, yet only 2% of this is spent within Black-owned businesses. By supporting Black owned and African-owned businesses, you contribute to alleviating existing economic disparities and breaking down systemic barriers that bog down Black enterprises.\n\nJewellery at Paper Pieces 2024 Zimfest Stall\n\nCommenting on the economic significance of Zimfest and wider community impacts, Jeff Madzingo, the CEO and Founder ofDiaspora Insurance, stated that Zimfest is a very significant event in more than one way. Beyond the socio-cultural importance, it glues a thriving community celebrating identity and togetherness. He further stated We, Diaspora Insurance, always plug in as a sponsor to make it worthwhile and economically viable to the organisers because Zimfest as a whole is not just an opportunity to empower each other, but a little economy where our black spending power is leveraged to prop up small community businesses that serve us as a people. By supporting the businesses of our people, we also invest in the economies of our home countries. When devouring delicious plates of food at Zimfest that leave you wanting to lick your fingers, it is not only the body that is being gloriously fed, but our businesses, our economies and our people.\n\nWhile Zimfest is very much about being together and interacting as a people, we must not forget the tangible, physical grounds and natural environment of Zimfest that allow us to partake in our festivities side by side. As well as maintaining respect for each other as attendees, we must also respect the venue and the natural grounds upon which we have been united and brought together as a community. After Zimfest, there were eyesores of waste littering the once green Herts Country Showground and a dismal afterparty of litter picking and waste removal had begun.\n\nA View of the Rubbish leftover at The Herts County Showground after Zimfest\n\nIn response to my queries on what Zimfest could implement and introduce to reduce waste and become more sustainable, the representative from the Zimfest organising team commented: Partnering with environmental organisations boosts recycling through more bins and community education on waste disposal. Collaborating with vendors to reduce single-use plastics and use biodegradable materials supports sustainability. Hosting workshops provides practical tips, fostering lasting environmental awareness. This strategy minimises waste and enhances community engagement for a greener future. As for the hideous congregations of waste dumped and abandoned by attendees at the venue after the event, the Zimfest representative stated: Efficient post-event waste management is essential for sustainability. Key strategies include:\n\nCollaborating with local waste management services for effective processing.\n\nHeres to a more green, clean and sustainable Zimfest!\n\nThe music, artistry and dancing\n\nZimfest is a place where people of all ages can dance as one.\n\nWithin a behind-the-scenes video displayed to the audience at a school fundraiser before my performance, I explained, Dancing in general [it was a tap performance] has always been such a passion of mine and a large part of that is credited to my heritage as a Shona person. Zimfest wholeheartedly made me feel the power of this acknowledgement. Through dancing and music, I immediately feel connected to my heritage, culture and history. This is why, as a second-generation Zimbabwean migrant living in the Diaspora, I am grateful to be able to attend festivals like Zimfest where you can fully embrace and enjoy the collective melodies, basslines, sways and shuffles that pulse through your body and tenderly deliver you home. Whether in the queue for food, walking across the grass to the main action or in the middle of the Amapiano tent, we were jiving and vibing. We were truly here. After leaving early morning and driving hours on the motorway to get to Zimfest, the sight of the Amapiano tent in the distance as we increasingly approached the Herts County Showground not only raised the energy in the car but also reenergised my sleepy self in the left backseat. Unaware of how the days events would unfold, I began to feel prepared and excited  a true testimony to the power of Zimfest.\n\nThe Amapiano tent at Zimfest 25\n\nOne special, cherished thing about the celebration and rejoice that occurs at Zimfest is that we rejoice in our mother languages. Living in the Diaspora, my mother tongue, Shona, is a language that often goes unheard as you pass by strangers on the street, get taught in the classrooms or converse with peers. Yet, at Zimfest, Shona is far from scarce. Reflecting on her experience in the Amapiano tent and in front of the main stage, Tinaye stated, People being able to pronounce the lyrics stood out to me the most. Hearing the crowd singing what sounds correct was quite shocking. The opportunity to hear your language being spoken, sung and chanted en masse is an undeniably soul-soothing experience that I never take for granted.\n\nDespite not understanding the lyrics of the songs, I have watched my non-Zimbabwean friends turn into absolute fanatics of Zimbabwean music and Amapiano. From some never even hearing of Amapiano before, humorously mistaking it for me saying Im a piano to jumping in a manner almost as spirited as Jah Signal in the Amapiano tent, it was pure bliss to see them fully embrace the Zimbabwean rhythms and festivities. Seeing their excitement to see Winky D grace the Zimfest stage as headliner once again was a wonderful way to end our time at Zimfest. Winky Ds stage presence is undoubtedly barrier-breaking not just beyond language but for the physical distance fromkumusha. Despite the headliner no longer onstage and the Zimfest crowds already dispersing, it wasnt yet our time to go. At least, not before taking some group pictures at this years newly added Zimfest sign adorned with the colours of the Zimbabwean flag. What a way to close off such a monumental day of unity, pride, radiance and transcendence!\n\nThe newly added Zimfest Sign on the Herts Country Showground\n\nWhile this years Zimfest lineup certainly did not cease to enthral and entertain, there are still ways to improve, especially with regard to inclusivity and diversity. In response to my inquiry about the diversification of Zimfest to, for example, include more languages and a more diverse lineup with more women, the representative from the Zimfest organising team replied: Incorporating other African languages into Zimfest would enhance inclusivity, celebrate diverse cultures, attract a wider audience, and foster cultural exchange. Zimfest focuses on enhancing diversity by including more languages and a varied lineup, actively seeking female artists from diverse African backgrounds. Future plans involve partnering with cultural ambassadors and community leaders to highlight unique contributions from different African communities.\n\nConclusion\n\nThese are the reasons why I, as a second-generation migrant living in the Diaspora, have always felt Zimfest is the day of summer, if not the year, that I always look forward to. From the small joys of finding out I wasnt too old for the ferris wheel to the big joys of watching my non-Zimbabwean friends indulge in Sadza for the first time and later repeatedly scream at the top of their lungs in unison with the Zimfest crowds Noooooo in response to Winky D asking Can I go home?, Zimfest is a true refresher for the soul and spirit. We must come to festivals such as Zimfest to celebrate, support and rejoice as a people with Ubuntu ablaze.\n\nI simply cannot stop scrolling through the new memories captured in my camera roll. The return home after Zimfest has not just been physical  equipped with new, beautiful jewellery to adorn at my next outing and a cheeky packet of lemon creams my mum surprised me with this week  but emotional, spiritual and transcendental. The warmth of Zimfest takes me back to my few but meaningful moments kumusha such as sitting across the blazing fire and bonding with my loved ones to watchingvana sekuru nanambuyajive while Zim classics such as Mukanyas Chimurenga music ring out. The event began with rain leading us to take cover in the Amapiano tent  with our dance moves making it all less miserable  and, as the festivities progressed and picked up, it was not just the daylight that got brighter and clearer.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa has conceded that South Africa is grappling with the United States decision to impose a30% tariff on local imports, but insists the country is not alone in facing mounting global trade challenges.\n\nIn his weekly newsletter, Ramaphosa described the new US tariffs as a stark reminder of the urgent need to adapt to increasingly turbulent headwinds in international trade.\n\nThe US is South Africas second-largest trading partner by country, and these measures will have a considerable impact on industries that rely heavily on exports to that country and on the workers they employ, as well as on our fiscus, he said.\n\nSectors such as agriculture, automotive and textiles have historically benefited from duty-free access to the US market under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which now faces disruption.\n\nRamaphosa said that South Africas trade relationship with the US has historically been complementary, saying local exports do not compete with US producers and do not pose a threat to US industry.\n\nLargely, our exports are inputs into US industries and therefore support the United States industrial base, he said.\n\nSouth Africa is also the biggest investor from the African continent into the US, with 22 of our companies investing in a number of sectors including mining, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and the food chain.\n\nThe 30% tariff was recently announced by the Trump administration and will take effect on 7 August.\n\nSouth Africa is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa singled out for the steep tariff, reflecting deteriorating relations between Pretoria and Washington.\n\nOther African countries, such as Lesotho and Zimbabwe, will face a 15% tariff from the same date.\n\nThe announcement is a significant blow to South Africas economy, particularly as the government had been working to strengthen trade ties with the US.\n\nThis included deals on liquefied natural gas imports, easing poultry import regulations and investments in US industries.\n\nRamaphosa defended South African imports, arguing they ultimately benefit US consumers through greater variety and lower costs.\n\nFor example, citrus production is counter-seasonal and does not pose a threat to US production, he said.\n\nFurthermore, production by US companies has been on the decline due to low yields, citrus greening disease and other factors unrelated to competition from imports.\n\nSouth Africa, the worlds second-largest citrus exporter, has helped to stabilise supply and prices in the US market.\n\nWe have been engaging the United States to enhance mutually beneficial trade and investment relations. All channels of communication remain open, said Ramaphosa.\n\nOur foremost priority is protecting our export industries.\n\nHe said the government would continue to engage with US officials while also accelerating efforts to diversify export markets, particularly within Africa.\n\nWith a view to helping our producers and exporters aggressively explore alternative markets, we have established an Export Support Desk to assist affected producers, he said.\n\nRamaphosa added that details of a support package for companies, producers and workers impacted by the tariffs would be announced soon.\n\nHe said the intervention would also assist industries seeking to expand into regions such as the rest of Africa, Asia, the Middle East and other existing trade agreement markets.\n\nStrengthening regional value chains will be key to building resilience for our export markets in the longer term, he said.\n\nMuch as strengthening and establishing alternative value chains will take time, this moment presents us with an opportunity to push forward with the implementation and expansion of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nRamaphosa stressed the need to reduce South Africas dependence on specific export markets, calling it a strategic imperative to build economic resilience.\n\nIn the coming months, we will be scaling up our trade missions into new markets in Africa and beyond, as well as the National Exporter Development Programme, whose aim is to grow the pool of export-ready companies, he said.\n\nTrump has opposed several South African policies, including land expropriation, which he controversially claimed allowed land to be taken from white farmers.\n\nThe Presidency has firmly denied such claims,including that one of genocide on white farmers.\n\nRamaphosa met with Trump in May in a bid to mend relations, but no progress was made as things had gone worse.\n\nDespite growing tensions, Ramaphosa insisted that South Africa is not alone in facinghigh tariffs.\n\nA number of export-reliant developed and developing economies, including several on the continent, are also grappling with these measures, he said.\n\nThe international trading system is changing. Complacency will not serve us, and building resilience is imperative.\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of Departments of Trade, Industry and Competition Parks Tau and Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Ronald Lamola will be having a joint press briefing on Monday morning to address the issue of high tariffs.\n\nThe briefing will take place at 10 a.m. at the Germiston Civic Centre, in Ekurhuleni.\n\nMeanwhile on Saturday,ANC NEC member Dr Kgosientsho Ramokgopatold journalists there had been a spirited and robust discussion on the US tariffs.\n\nHe said negotiations between the US and South Africa were ongoing, and expressed confidence that the two nations would be able to find each other.\n\n",
