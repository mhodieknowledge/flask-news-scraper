Also, Gifford contested in Zanu PF primaries to choose a 2023 candidate for Zvimba West against Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi and incumbent legislator Mercy Maruva-Dinha. Besides expulsion which he resists, Gifford recently had his car and rural house vandalized for his stance.\n\nThe suspected Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) operatives broke down doors, threatened to kill Gomwes mother and burn down her Budiriro 5 house.\n\nRecorded calls between Gomwe and the abductees indicated that they were taking her to their Zvimba rural home, where they sought to have her point out Giffords whereabouts.\n\nGomwe, who was suspended from the ruling party for criticising Mnangagwa and siding with a faction against the partys 2030 Agenda, can be heard in a recorded call begging the abductees to release his mother.\n\nShe had neither eaten nor taken her medication from the time they forcibly took her from their Budiriro home, according to the audios.\n\nA roadblock pitched at an area known as Carina, along the Harare-Bulawayo highway, became a stumbling block for the abductees who felt they could get in trouble with police officers manning the checkpoint.\n\nAs a result, the suspected State agents pushed out the senior from the vehicle a few metres from a Norton roadblock, made a U-turn towards Harare and disappeared. Gomwes mother then approached police officers manning the block for assistance.\n\nThese six men were instructing my mother to share information about Giffords whereabouts but did not tell her why they wanted him, read a statement by Gomwe after she was eventually found.\n\nAfter she was dumped, she walked about 50 metres to the Carina roadblock where I got a call from the Sergeant heading the block to come pick her up.\n\nAn abduction and unlawful entry report has been filed at Budiriro Police Station under RRB number 6414038.\n\nGomwe and nine other party members, who were suspended for challenging a faction in favour of keeping Mnangagwa in power beyond the constitutionally mandated 2028, are yet to be reintegrated.\n\n",

Plural for the word is Zvigananda.\n\nThis is Obey Chimuka, the owner of Fossil Contracting. He has done so many projects and some people think his projects are my projectshis company is also behind the recent construction of the Mbare Musika Markethe is a Chigananda, said Tagwirei amid wild applause from the audience.\n\nChimuka, who is on the United Kingdom sanctions list, also owns Khaya Cement, formerly LaFarge.\n\nTagwirei, Chief Executive Officer of Sakunda Holdings, was at Masvingo Polytechnic College for the Leadership Success Series programme.\n\nThe utterances by Tagwirei, who doubles as Chairperson of the controversial Land Tenure Implementation Committee, did not sit well with Mnangagwas spokesperson George Charamba, who took to his shadowy X account Dhonzamusoro007 to register his disapproval.\n\nWrote Charamba, My message to Zimbabweans. We can never grow and develop when we give wealth-generating initiatives derogatory names!!!\n\nTitle is key to capitalism we live under. Simply, we must learn to play the game. Unless we want socialism and can have it!!!\n\n",
