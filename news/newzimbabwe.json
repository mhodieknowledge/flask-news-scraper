It is take-it-or-leave it, said Shoriwa.\n\nAfter a long tiring day at work, you wouldnt want to be standing at the congested ranks risking being robbed and unsure when you will get home to your children.\n\nYou end up paying whatever amount, US$1 or US$2 for a trip that normally costs half that fare, she added.\n\nA commuter omnibus conductor, Munyaradzi Chogugudza said kombi crews take advantage of the rain season to increase daily takings.\n\nIt is time for us to cash in on the rains. We give the vehicle owner the agreed daily target, say US$40, and we pocket the difference from hiked faresevery dog has its day, chuckled Chogugudza, who plies the Hatcliffe route.\n\nThe Passengers Association of Zimbabwe (PAZ) told NewZimbabwe.com that its members had raised concerns over the unexplained fare hikes.\n\nAs the rainy season persists, the PAZ continues to receive complaints about exorbitant fares charged by transport operators, said PAZ president, Tafadzwa Goliath.\n\nDue to the rains, the poor state of roads has created a situation where passengers are being taken advantage of.\n\nPassengers are being charged excessive fares for short distances, supposedly due to the poor road conditions. Some roads, although trafficable, are being used as an excuse to inflate fares.\n\nPAZ is demanding fair bus fares pricing and transparency.\n\nTransport operators must charge fares that reflect the actual distance travelled and the conditions of roads.\n\nOperators should clearly display their fare structures and provide explanations for any price increases.\n\nGoliath said relevant authorities must intervene and regulate fares and ensure that passengers are not exploited.\n\nTogether, we can fight for fair and affordable transportation, said the PAZ president.\n\n",

Our sovereignty is not there anymore.\n\nAn unquantifiable number of Zimbabweans work in South Africa illegally.\n\nThey were forced to brave trekking down south, passing through a crocodile-infested Limpopo river, by Zimbabwes continuously worsening economy that has destroyed hopes of finding jobs.\n\nZimbabweans form a unit of foreigners that include Mozambicans, Malawians and Somalis, which has over the past decades fallen victim to xenophobic vigilante groups chasing them out of South Africa. This includes the infamous Dudula militia.\n\nAdded Mashaba: I do not understand the logic behind this. The people who made this decision want to make sure that South Africans are as poor as possible.\n\nWe know our neighbouring countries are dysfunctional as a result of South Africa also not assisting but we are making matters worse.\n\nI am not sure who they are trying to satisfy. If I had my way, there was no way we would allow anyone without documentation in our country.\n\nAllowing them to use services when we cannot afford them for our own people (does not make sense). You even find in some schools children numbering 90 in a class.\n\nThis is not the first time a senior official has questioned the use of public resources by illegal immigrants in the rainbow nation.\n\nIn 2022, a health official, Phophi Ramathuba, was recorded chastising a Zimbabwean woman who had travelled to South Africa for medical attention after being involved in a car accident.\n\nYou are killing my health system, is what Ramathuba told the woman on video.\n\n",

She was told it would be a white party  where attendees would wear white-coloured clothing  and was told to pack a white dress.\n\nBut when they arrived, she was shocked and furious to find no other guests present except for her partner, a photographer, the photographers friend and a celebrant, according to her deposition quoted in court documents.\n\nSo, when I got there, and I didnt see anybody in white, I asked him, Whats happening?.\n\nAnd he pulled me aside, and he told me that hes organising a prank wedding for his social media, to be precise, Instagram, because he wants to boost his content, and wants to start monetising his Instagram page, she said.\n\nShe said she had accepted his explanation as he was a social media person who had more than 17,000 followers on Instagram. She also believed that a civil marriage would be valid only if it were held in a court.\n\nStill, she remained concerned. The woman rang a friend and voiced her worries, but the friend laughed it off and said it would be fine because, if it were real, they would have had to file a notice of intended marriage first, which they had not.\n\nReassured, the woman went through the ceremony where she and her partner exchanged wedding vows and kissed in front of a camera. She said she was happy at that time to play along to make it look real.\n\nTwo months later, her partner asked her to add him as a dependant in her application for permanent residency in Australia. Both of them are foreigners.\n\nWhen she told him she could not as they were technically not married, he then revealed that their Sydney wedding ceremony had been genuine, according to the womans testimony.\n\nThe woman later found their marriage certificate, and discovered a notice of intended marriage which had been filed the month before their Sydney trip  before they even got engaged  which she said she did not sign. According to the court documents, the signature on the notice bears little resemblance to the womans.\n\nIm furious with the fact that I didnt know that that was a real marriage, and the fact that he also lied from the beginning, and the fact that he also wanted me to add him in my application, she said.\n\nIn his deposition, the man claimed they had both agreed to these circumstances and that following his proposal the woman had agreed to marry him at an intimate ceremony in Sydney.\n\nThe judge ruled that the woman was mistaken about the nature of the ceremony performed and did not provide real consent to her participation in the marriage.\n\nShe believed she was acting. She called the event a prank. It made perfect sense for her to adopt the persona of a bride in all things at the impugned ceremony so as to enhance the credibility of the video depicting a legally valid marriage, he stated in the judgement.\n\nThe marriage was annulled October of 2024.\n\n",

But what l can tell you is that we are now finalising the installation system of the bucket seats at the National Sports Stadium, said Mohadi.\n\nThe NSS was closed in 2023 for renovations after failing to meet Confederation of African Football (CAF) standards to host international matches due to lack of amenities, among other concerns.\n\nThis has forced the Warriors and all Zimbabwean clubs which participated in any CAF competition last year to host fixtures in foreign countries.\n\nBucket seats installation was amongst the top list of things required by CAF at the giant facility.\n\nOther than that, CAF also required the fitting of electronic turnstiles at the stadium, an uplift in the changing and medical area room.\n\nMohadi also added that government has embarked on a journey to renovate other dilapidated sporting facilities across the country.\n\nWe are also working on modernising other sporting facilities such as Magamba and others which are under the Ministry of Sport, he added.\n\nA report presented by the Minister of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture in 2024 before Parliament revealed that 90% of the countrys sporting facilities are nolonger fit for use and are in need of urgent facelifts.\n\n",

It has become clear that his disappearance and harrowing ordeal and encounter with big game animals in Matusadonha Game Park, deep in the Zambezi Valley, has deeply affected not only him but also his family.\n\nAs part of their recommendations, the team has decided to temporarily move Tinotenda and his mother away from their home for a few days to provide them with a safer and calmer environment to prevent people from disturbing the recovery process, said the legislator.\n\nThe assessment team, she noted, will remain in the community for several days and also engage with school officials to prevent any discussions that could re-trigger trauma.\n\nAdditionally, the mental health team will return and be stationed in the community for not less than seven days to continue providing support and monitoring the boys and family progress.\n\nWith schools reopening soon, they will also engage the school authorities to ensure that when Tinotenda comes back to school, no interviews or discussions take place that might retraumatize him, said Murombedzi.\n\nThe mental health team still strongly advise against anyone conducting interviews at this stage as it may trigger emotional distress for the learner who is now proceeding to Grade Three.\n\n",
