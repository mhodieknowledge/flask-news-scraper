            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nIn a dramatic turn of events, war veterans from Spring Farm in Goromonzi have emerged victorious in a court case concerning the contentious loss of their land to businessman Billy Rautenbach. This followed the governments cancellation of their offer letters.\n\nSeeking justice, the veterans turned to the High Court after Rautenbach, a business associate of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, assumed control of the land. The courtroom erupted in joy when Judge Regis Dembure of the Harare High Court handed down the ruling on Thursday.\n\nThe judge was critical of Lands Minister Anxious Masuka, chastising him for his irrational and inconsiderate decision to cancel the veterans offer letters. Although the ministry had initially challenged the veterans application, Masuka failed to submit an opposing affidavit, a significant misstep that ultimately led to the cases outcome.\n\nThe court heard that the minister had delegated authority to the permanent secretary, a move that Dembure rejected outright. Striking off the permanent secretarys affidavit, the judge declared that the veterans legal arguments stood unopposed, leading to their victory.\n\nI wish to point out that the law in relation to authority to act is already settled that where authority has been challenged, it will be necessary to produce evidence, said Judge Dembure.\n\nHe emphasised the importance of substantiating claims regarding authority in court.\n\nThe judge added, What is clear is that where the authority of a defendant is put on issue, there will be a need to put evidence of that authority in court. He dismissed the permanent secretarys mere assertion of authority, saying, There is no evidence before me to show that he has authority.\n\nDembure further explained, The act of withdrawal of the offer letter is by the minister and cannot be delegated. The decision is his and he must justify his action.\n\nThe judge also said that the minister is expected by law to make decisions independently, stating, No delegated authority can speak on his behalf.\n\nIn his ruling, the judge noted that the minister only has the power to delegate administrative, not statutory, authority.\n\nIf a decision-maker has failed to depose an affidavit, its inadmissible.\n\nThe judge highlighted that the ministers actions had severely disrupted the veterans livelihood.\n\nHe criticised Masuka for not thoughtfully considering the implications of withdrawing the offer letters.\n\nHe is the one who should have told the court if it was a good intention to withdraw the offer letters and what was his state of mind when he formulated these decisions, Dembure said.\n\nIn the absence of his affidavit, the opposition is clearly a nullity. There is no proper opposition before the court.\n\nConsequently, the opposition was struck out, allowing the case to proceed without challenge.\n\nCritics of the allocation of Spring Farm to Rautenbachs Marimba Residential Properties Limited had raised concerns about potential manipulation and corruption surrounding the land seizure in Mashonaland East Province.\n\nWar veterans expressed alarm when it became known that Rautenbach was granted the deed of transfer for the land on June 5, 2025, prior to the court hearing, while indigenous farmers, including the veterans, had their applications still pending in court.\n\nAs if to heighten tensions, armed guards were deployed around the farm last week, further complicating matters ahead of the judicial proceedings.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nThe Atteridgeville Magistrates Court in Pretoria has denied bail to a 55-year-old Zimbabwean national based in Saulsville, who was charged with three counts of raping his landlords 12-year-old daughter.\n\nThe horrific rape incidents allegedly happened in March.\n\nThe NPAs firm opposition to bail underscores its unwavering commitment to combating gender-based violence (GBV) and protecting vulnerable children, said the National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) Gauteng regional spokesperson, Lumka Mahanjana.\n\nThe name of the alleged rapist has been withheld to protect the identity of the minor victim.\n\nMahanjana explained that the accused man had been a tenant at the girls family home in Saulsville for 12 years as of March.\n\nHe allegedly called the 12-year-old girl to his back room in the yard on three separate occasions, raped her, and gave her money ranging from R24 to R50 to buy kotas.\n\nOn 25 June 2025, in the evening, while the complainant (the young girl) was on the phone in the house, her mother asked her who she was talking to, and when she could not respond, the mother requested to go through her phone. While going through the phone, she saw conversations where the accused (tenant) was asking the complainant when she will be going on her periods, said Mahanjana.\n\nThe mother confronted the tenant in his back room, where he denied the allegations and requested that they take the child to Kalafong Hospital in Tshwane for examination.\n\nWhile at the hospital during examination, one of the nurses called the police, and the accused was arrested on the scene.\n\nDuring the bail hearing, the accused, through his legal representative, asked to be released on bail, claiming that the states case was weak and citing his responsibilities to support his wife and six children. He further stated that, as a self-employed individual, detention would hinder his income and ability to afford legal fees, said Mahanjana.\n\nHowever, state prosecutor Katlego Manana opposed bail, arguing the severity of the charges and the high prevalence of such offences in the courts jurisdiction.\n\nManana highlighted the risk of the Zimbabwean man interfering with the investigation, due to his familiarity with the victim and her mother.\n\nThe prosecution also noted the accused mans lack of immovable property in South Africa, increasing the likelihood of him evading trial.\n\nThe magistrate said the Zimbabwean man did not produce any proof that he is self-employed and that there is no evidence that shows whether he stays with his family in the country or has left them in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe magistrate added that in his bail application, the accused man only listed his responsibilities and no substantial circumstances.\n\nMoreover, the magistrate said if the accused suffers financially while in custody and cannot afford a legal representative, he can apply for Legal Aid. Therefore, bail was denied.\n\nMeanwhile, the National Prosecuting Authority in Gauteng has welcomed the courts decision, commending the vigilance of the victims mother, whose swift action led to the tenants arrest.\n\nThe NPA also saluted the vigilant staff at Kalafong Hospital who facilitated police involvement.\n\nActing Director of Public Prosecutions in Gauteng, advocate Marika Jansen Van Vuuren has also commended prosecutor Manana for the fight against the accused mans bail bid.\n\nThe denial of bail sends a clear message: the NPA will vigorously oppose release for those accused of heinous GBV crimes, prioritising the safety of victims and communities, she said.\n\nThe NPA urges families and communities to remain vigilant, report suspected abuse promptly, and support survivors throughThuthuzela Care Centres (TCCs), which offer medical, psychological, and legal assistance.\n\nThe NPA has called on South Africans to unite against gender-based violence, fostering safe environments where childrens constitutional rights to dignity and safety are upheld, and perpetrators face the full might of the law.\n\nThe case against the Zimbabwean man was postponed to 23 July for regional court allocation.\n\nLast year,IOL reported that a32-year-old Olievenhoutbosch father was found guilty of the rapeand attempted murder of his 11-month-old daughter, as well as defeating the ends of justice in the High Court in Pretoria.\n\nAt the time, the NPA said the father and the mother of the baby were in a love relationship, and on the evening of April 30, 2023, the couple was at their place of residence when a neighbour came and asked the mother to come and help her cook.\n\nThe neighbour who asked for help was hosting an overnight ceremony. The childs mother then departed with the neighbour, leaving the baby under the guardianship of her father.\n\nThe following day, in the early hours of the morning, while the mother was still assisting the neighbour, she saw her partner on the streets. When she asked about the whereabouts of the baby, he told her that he had left the baby sleeping, Mahanjana said at the time.\n\n",

Our appeal suspends the High Court Ruling. He then insists that the party has no leader but if we are to implement the High Court ruling it means the default position is that we fall back to the Extraordinary Congress position.\n\nWhere Senator Mwonzora was elected President and Komichi returns his chairman position and Mudzuri as Deputy National chairman, but unfortunately, Komichi has already formed his party so automatically he has lost his right to return his position, said Damba.\n\nMudzuri and other disgruntled MDC-T members won their court challenge seeking to nullify Mwonzoras 2022 election as party leader. The High Court ordered the MDC-T to return to pre-election structures and convene an extraordinary congress. Mwonzora has since filed an appeal with the Supreme Court.\n\nDamba said Mudzuris latest actions were disruptive, coinciding with the Epworth by-election campaign.\n\nUnfortunately, our case us still before the courts and please note that it is not us who approached the courts but its them, so we are simply pursuing the legal route that they initiated.\n\nUnfortunately, Mudzuri is so wayward that he called for a press conference today, and nobody knows what he wanted to announce.\n\nThe MDC is a party with a constitution and all meetings are structured around certain office bearers, not the chaotic manner in which he wants to do it and he decided to do it at a time we are campaigning in Epworth North Ward 6 By Election. He intends to disrupt our by-election campaign so that Zanu-PF wins the seat, said Damba.\n\n",
