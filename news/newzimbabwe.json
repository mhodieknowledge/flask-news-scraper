            "content": "The Varakashi are using anonymous and fake accounts to mock, delegitimise and threaten opposition to the ruling ZANU PF party.\n\nZimbabwes brutal regime, under President Emmerson Mnangagwa, is using social media, particularly X, to smear and silence mostly female anti-government political activists and human rights defenders in the country.\n\nPresident Mnangagwas army of paid pro-government social media trolls is known as theVarakashipropaganda stormtrooperswith some using names of prominent people to open fake X accounts without their knowledge. One ghostX account usesthe name of Zimbabwes former vice president, Joice Mujuru. Even President Mnangagwas spokesperson, George Charambawho is also a senior government employee runs two toxic ghost X accounts@Jamwanda2and@dhonzamusoro007which he uses to attack and post completely fabricated and malicious information about female human rights defenders and political activists in Zimbabwe. The first of these accounts wassuspended in 2022but was reinstated after Elon Musk acquired Twitter and renamed it X.\n\nIn the past year there has been a proliferation of toxic X accounts in the country and they are flourishing. At times, these X accounts incite physical and sexual violence against female political and human rights activists. In one post, a ghost X account threatened a prominent human rights activist that [Im] waiting to rape you. The post drew outrage from X users, and it was later deleted.\n\nAnd in astudy published in 2023, Constance Kasiyamhuru from the University of Johannesburg in South Africa said the Varakashi in Zimbabwe operate mostly on Twitter/X to shut down the political opponents of the governing Zanu PF party.\n\nThrough trolling, name-calling, threats, mocking, mobbing, labelling, ridicule, casting aspersions, delegitimation, disinforming, and other strategies, Varakashi seek to regulate, censure, and discipline anti-musangano[anti-ruling party] online discourse, Kasiyamhuru wrote.\n\nTendai Ruben Mbofana, a Zimbabwe based social justice advocate and writer, said the systematic deployment of online trollsparticularly targeting female human rights defenders and political activistshas become a chilling hallmark of repression in Zimbabwe.\n\nThese smear campaigns are not just personal attacks; they are part of a broader strategy to delegitimise our work, intimidate us into silence, and discredit our credibility in the eyes of the public, Mbofana said.\n\nHe added that the abuse often takes on a deeply misogynistic tone, laced with gendered insults, threats of sexual violence, and false accusations designed to shame and isolate women.\n\nIt creates a climate of fear and forces many women out of digital spaces that should otherwise be used to amplify their voices and advocacy, he said.\n\nSophia Gwasira, who was elected as the first female mayor for Mutare City in eastern Zimbabwe in August 2023, told Index on Censorship that the fear of being smeared and attacked on social media platforms by Zanu PF social media trolls was forcing many women to abandon opposition politics and activism. She said social media platforms were no longer safe places for women in opposition politics in Zimbabwe, with the attackes affecting both them and their families.\n\nIts affecting us not only physically but emotionally too. We are trying to find ways of countering these attacks. But currently we dont have any protection from our own political parties or from the government, Gwasira said.\n\nBut Gwasira said she will continue to fight for the people and, given the opportunity, she would contest the general elections slated for 2028. Gwasira and many other opposition mayors, MPs and councillors were recalled in late 2023 after her party, the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC)was hijackedby President Mnangagwas ruling party Zanu PF through its proxy, Sengezo Tshabangu. This forced the CCC leader Nelson Chamisa toabandon the oppositionparty and he took a sabbatical from party politics in January 2024.\n\nPromise Mkwananzi, spokesperson for opposition party Citizens Coalition for Changewhich is still loyal to former leader Nelson Chamisa told Index on Censorship that as opposition, they have been identifying and exposing some of these social media ghost accounts and to direct their members to counter the toxic narratives on X.\n\nIt must be noted also that these trolls are paid using taxpayers money to denigrate women and bully voices of the alternative on social media, Mkwananzi said.\n\nBut Mkwananzi was quick to add that his party will continue to fight and mobilise people for a better Zimbabwe.\n\nWe are also educating our members to be strong and to remain focused on recruiting mobilising, educating and radicalising the base.\n\nAlthough women are the main target, men critical of the ruling party are also targeted.\n\nIn my own experience, I have faced repeated, coordinated attacks on X, particularly from anonymous accounts believed to be run or supported by high-ranking government officials, including the presidents spokesperson. These attacks are aimed at silencing dissent and discouraging public engagement. But we will not be silenced. If anything, these attacks only reinforce the urgency of our work, said Tendai Ruben Mbofana Mbofana.\n\nWhen President Mnangagwaseized powerthrough a military coup from Zimbabwes long-time dictator, Robert Mugabe in 2017, President Mnangagwa promised sweeping reforms; economic and political reforms, including upholding human rights and rule of law in the country.\n\nHowever, Zimbabwe has become worse under President Mnangagwa than Mugabe; political opponents to Zanu PF have been brutalised,torturedandkilledand corruption is widespread.\n\nA recent reportby Human Rights Watch said authorities in Zimbabwe have continued to restrict civic space and the rights to freedom of expression, association, and peaceful assembly and the human rights, political and economic situation in Zimbabwe continues to deteriorate.\n\nUnder the current constitution, President Mnangagwas term of officehis second and last termends in 2028 but his party is now planning to amend the constitution to keep him in office till 2030. Meanwhile, Mnangagwas Varakashi are flooding social media with messages in support of the extension of his term and touting his achievements so far.\n\n",

Kazembe Kazembe, and ZRP Commissioner-General Stephen Mutamba for damages, said the victim was initially awarded ZWL$295,000 in November 2020, which was unpaid and lost value due to inflation.\n\nThe labour law specialist had to undergo three unsuccessful eye surgeries to remove fine glass particles that pierced his eyes after a bullet fired by soldiers shattered glass windows at his ZCTU offices.\n\nMutimutema, who was represented by Obey Shava of ZLHR, had initially been awarded ZWL$295,000 as damages in November 2020 as damages for pain and suffering, medical expenses and general damages which Muchinguri, Kazembe and Mutamba had reneged on paying.\n\nThe labour law specialist had to file an application wherein he amended his summons, arguing that the compensation award had been significantly eroded by inflation.\n\nOn Tuesday 29 July 2025, Mutimutema was a relieved man after Muchinguri agreed to pay the labour law specialist US$25,000 as compensation for damages for current and future medical expenses, pain and suffering and general damages, ZLHR said.\n\nAt least six people were shot dead by soldiers during the protest.\n\nA Commission of Inquiry, chaired by former South African President Kgalema Motlanthe and appointed by President Emmerson Mnangagwa to probe the post-election violence, recommended that government should compensate all the victims of the shootings and prosecute perpetrators.However, there has been no prosecution of perpetrators.\n\n",

Once formalised, the NPS would recognise the projects potential to generate broad-based economic benefits, attract foreign investment, and create employment opportunities, said the company.\n\nInvictus is currently finalising formalities required for the official granting of NPS, which will unlock a range of fiscal and non-fiscal incentives, including duty exemptions, expedited permitting, and streamlined access to critical infrastructure and services.\n\nAs a gesture of appreciation for the Invictus Energy potential, the Mutapa Investment Fund (MIF) recently injected US$5 million to accelerate the projects exploration activities, including flow testing, drilling, and seismic surveys, as Invictus transitions from exploration to development.\n\nDuring the quarter, Invictus Energy continued to progress discussions with a number of prospective farm-in and strategic partners for participation in the future development of the Cabora Bassa Project. These parties include established industry operators and investment groups with the capacity to provide both strategic capital and substantial technical and operational capabilities.\n\nTheir expertise aligns with the Companys forward program, which aims to unlock a new resource base through high-impact exploration while advancing the appraisal and potential commercialisation of the Mukuyu gas field.\n\n",
