            "content": "Stellenbosch University\n\nTechnology entrepreneur and investor Strive Masiyiwa, a pioneer of the mobile telecommunications sector in Africa, received an honorary doctorate in Engineering from Stellenbosch University (SU) on 10 December 2024. The visionary leader has over the past four decades helped to cement Africas telecoms industry and business sector, while his philanthropy has improved socioeconomic development to the benefit of the continents people.\n\nThe Faculty is humbled that Mr Masiyiwa accepted this honorary doctorate in Engineering from Stellenbosch University. He is an exemplary example of an African who did well and is now doing good by improving the lives of many Africans. The Faculty looks forward to partnering with him in our endeavour to make an impact to improve the quality of life of people in Africa, says Prof Wikus van Niekerk, Dean of the SU Faculty of Engineering.\n\nMasiyiwa, whose career is rooted in engineering, was born in Zimbabwe in 1961 and now lives in the UK. He obtained a bachelors degree in Electrical and Electronic Engineering from the University of Cardiff in Wales in 1983, after which he returned to Zimbabwe to briefly work as a telecoms engineer before setting up his first business in 1986.\n\nThe business network of this founder and executive chair ofCassava Technologiesspans Africa, Europe, India, Latin America, the Middle East, and the USA.

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE gruelling tax measures introduced by Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube in his latest 2025 National Budget have spilt over to parliament following concerns raised by Industry hinting the interventions are set to destroy whatever is left of the formal sector.\n\nRattled by the endless piling up of taxes on the industry, which experts warn may diminishthe little gains of what remainsin the delicate formal sector, Business Member Organisations (BMOs) concerns exposedgrave inconsistencies in the National Budget Blueprint requiring urgent redress.\n\nA Non-Adverse Report received by the Parliamentary Legal Committee contains several concerns raised by Industry.\n\nFor instance, the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI)says withthe reduction of the degree of export orientation from 100% to 80% for manufacturing companies under SEZ it will be difficult to penetrate the export market due to highproductioncosts.\n\nWe are of the view that the 25% tax on rental income istoo high as there are other costs to be met by rental income collections, like renovations, maintenance costs among others. The proposal is to ensure that the tax is applied on net rental income as opposed to gross revenue from rentals, the industry lobby group said.\n\nCZI further submitted that IMTT taxes the whole value chain resulting in up to 10% additional costs to products leaving local products priced relatively higher than regional products.\n\nThe Confederation of Zimbabwe Retailers (CZR) CZR proposed the removal of tax on fast foods and betting tax which seem to target the poor.\n\nThere are a number of taxes charged on the purchase of food such as VAT, IMTT and the proposed fast-food tax which further burdens the poor. Such taxes need stakeholder consultations before they are introduced, the retailers group said.\n\nThe Chamber of Mines noted that the 2025 National Budget Statement was announced at a time when the mining industry is operating below its potential on the back of a challenging environment characterised by weak commodity prices, foreign currency shortfalls, capital shortages and fragile power supply.\n\nCoupled with a high-cost structure on the backdrop of high royalties and taxes, high electricity tariff, exchange rate losses and high cost of funding mining projects, the viability of mining companies has been severely compromised. These challenges have combined to weigh down on the performance of the mining industry with mineral revenue coming down significantly and mining companies struggling to meet their production targets.\n\nThe proposal to extend the royalty on coal to all types of coal, including coking and industrial coal, will increase production costs in the energy sector. This extension translates into higher operational expenses, impacting various downstream industries. Specifically, the cost of generating thermal power is likely to rise, as this additional cost will be passed down to Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC), the miners group said.\n\nThe grouping contends that the agriculture industry, particularly the tobacco sector, will be directly affected by the increased cost of industrial coal used for tobacco curing.\n\nMiners also expressed dissatisfaction over Ncubespolicy to the effect that minerals will be deemed sold at the value determined on either the date the sales contract is entered or the date on which the purchaser receives the product, whichever is higher.\n\nThe proposed measure may lead to disputes between ZIMRA and taxpayers, as during periods of price declines, ZIMRA may require miners to pay royalties on unrealised cash proceeds, the Chamber of Mines said.\n\nMiners also contested the 20% Capital Gains Tax as too high and way beyond the regional averages. They were of the view that the tax must not be applied in retrospect and that the rate be maintained at 5% as effected in 2017.\n\nRoyalty for platinum is high at 7%, the Chamber of Mines recommends a commodity price-linked royalty framework for platinum as follows: a base royalty of 3 % for the platinum price of up to US$1,100 / ounce, a royalty rate of 5% for a platinum price between US$1,100 /ounce and US$1,400, a royalty rate of 7% for platinum price between US$1,400/ounce and US$2,000/ounce and a royalty of 10% for platinum price above US$2,000 ounce.\n\nRoyalty for diamonds at 10% is also impacting negatively on the viability of diamond projects. Producers of alluvial diamonds which are predominantly low quality are the most affected as their prices have taken a huge knock, the report reads.\n\n",

            "content": "By Nqoba M Sibenke\n\nOne thing I find fascinating is the mechanism that regulates our mood. Mood refers to a state of the mind at a certain time for example happiness, sadness, gloom, excitement etc.\n\nOur body has mood regulators in the form of hormones which determine our mood at a particular time. Hormones are chemicals that the body produces for specific functions. When we feel unhappy and stressed certain hormones are responsible for unhappiness. Similarly, there are also happy hormones or happy juices. These enhance our happiness and reduce stress. These are Oxytocin, endorphins, serotonin and Dopamine. These four juices work differently from each other. They also have different roles and characteristics.\n\nDOPAMINE\n\nDopamine is also known as the feel good hormone. It is both a neurotransmitter and a hormone. A neurotransmitter is a chemical that relays information between nerve cells in the brain and the rest of the body. As a neuro hormone, it is produced by the hypothalamus in the brain. Dopamine has several functions which include movement, memory, pleasurable reward and motivation, behaviour and cognition, attention, sleep and arousal, mood, and learning.\n\nDopamine has been said to function based on motivation and reward. When we do a pleasurable activity we feel motivated which stimulates the secretion of Dopamine. As Dopamine is released we feel good and motivated to do more of the pleasurable activity. However, this can also lead to addiction.\n\nWhen we have balanced levels of Dopamine we will feel happy, motivated, alert and focused. On the other hand low levels of the hormone result in poor memory, fatigue, sadness, mood swings, and poor concentration among others. There is also a relationship between levels of Dopamine and mental disorders like schizophrenia, Mania, ADHD, Parkinsons and Addictions. To have healthy Dopamine levels we need to engage more in activities that give us pleasure however moderation is essential.\n\nENDORPHINS\n\nEndorphins function as painkillers. They are in actual fact natural pain killers. They get their name from a combination of two words endogenous  and morphine . Most of us are aware of the function of morphine which is to ease pain. When we are hurt or are experiencing pain, nerves communicate with the brain and the brain releases Endorphins.\n\nEndorphins can be naturally stimulated by engaging in activity that rewards like eating, massage, intimacy, dancing and such activities. It should be noted that Endorphins might have similarities with Dopamine however their function is different.\n\nA deficiency of Endorphins can result in a number of negative symptoms such as anxiety, depression, addiction, and sleep disorders among many others.\n\nSEROTONIN\n\nLike Dopamine, Serotonin also doubles as a neurotransmitter. Its key functions include learning, memory, and happiness as well as regulating body temperature, sleep, sexual behaviour and hunger. It is a key hormone which is mostly found in the gut.\n\nSerotonin has been known to be a mood stabilizer. It creates a feeling of calmness and emotional stability. Lack of Serotonin may result in mood disorders, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, digestive disorders, suicidal behaviour, OCD, phobia and many other issues. It is therefore important to ensure good production of Serotonin, this can be done by exercising and sunbathing moderately.\n\nOXYTOCIN\n\nThe love hormone  as it is commonly known, Oxytocin is responsible for enhancing happiness through bonding. It is produced in the hypothalamus. Oxytocin has been proven to be responsible for smooth labour during childbirth. After childbirth, it helps in lactation which is the production of milk for the baby.\n\nAmong its many functions, Oxytocin helps in regulating sleep and moods. It promotes overall wellness and mental stability. It is enhanced mostly by intimate actions like touch, hugging, cuddling, and sexual activity among many others.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nHaving discussed briefly about hormones that regulate mood and produce positive emotions, it is apparent that we can be deliberate in determining our mood.\n\nAn exception is in cases where the body is unable to produce the particular hormones. In such cases, medication is usually given for example Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors which help boost Serotonin levels and control Depression. Similarly, in the case of Dopamine, the doctor can prescribe antidepressants and dopamine reuptake inhibitors.\n\nMood has a huge impact on our total wellness hence the importance of acquiring knowledge on how we can harness the faculties that regulate mood.\n\nAs we approach the festive season, a season of joy, giving and all good things let us make the best of our happy hormones and help others to be happy too.\n\nNqoba Sibenke is a registered intern Counselling Psychologist and can be reached atnqoba.sibenke@icloud.com/ +263715330911\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nLISTED horticulture concern, Tanganda Tea Company (TTC) has rescinded the decision to migrate its stocks to the Victoria Falls Exchange (VFEX), instead opting to pursue a special listing on the US$-only denominated stocks market.\n\nLast month, Tanganda board of directors announced plans to hold discussions aimed at relocating the companys listing to capitalise on VFEXs stable currency environment and incentives, reflecting a growing trend among Zimbabwean firms.\n\nThe firm, which rejoined the ZSE on February 3, 2022, with an initial market capitalisation of US$134.29 million, has faced significant losses attributed to currency volatility and economic shifts. Following the scrapping of the Zimbabwe dollar and the introduction of the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency in April, Tangandas valuation dropped to US$21.67 million, marking a loss of approximately US$112.62 million in market value since its ZSE listing.\n\nBut in a major climb down this week, Tanganda informed its shareholders that the decision for a full-scale migration will no longer be the case.\n\nReference is made to the Cautionary Announcements published on 28 October 2024 and 18 November 2024 regarding the proposed migration of Tanganda listing from the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) to the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange (VFEX) and the subsequent capital raise by way of a Renouncable Rights Offer to raise approximately US$7,7 million.\n\nThe Directors no longer recommend the migration of Tangandas listing to VFEX. Instead, they propose the creation of a class of shares to be known as Class A ordinary shares, which will be subsequently listed on the VFEX as a Secondary listing, the company said.\n\nThe company said a capital raise by way of a Renounceable Rights Offer to raise US$8 million will follow soon after the issuing, listing and allotment of Class A ordinary shares to the existing ordinary shareholders in proportion to their shareholding in the company.\n\nTanganda believes such initiatives are intended to enhance the companys capital structure, diversify shareholder offerings and ensure liquidity of the companys shares.\n\nFurther details regarding the transactions will be provided in a Circular to shareholders that is being finalized.\n\nThe transactions, if successful, may have a material effect on the Companys share price. Accordingly, shareholders are advised to exercise caution when dealing in the Companys shares, the company added.\n\n",
