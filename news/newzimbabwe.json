arrested early Friday morning when a car he was travelling in was stopped, searched and discovered to have 26 blasting cartridges and 15 capped fuse connectors; which are both forms of explosives.Images of him in handcuffs were plastered over the internet, with Zanu PF acolytes celebrating it like a win.He is being held at Pretoria Central and expected to appear in court on Monday.His South African lawyer Eric Mabuza said Sikhala was denying any knowledge of the crime while the South African Police Service (SAPS) had already made efforts to review footage at a mall the former legislator visited earlier.Sikhala was said to have been arrested after going for dinner with one of his uncles (also in police custody).It is an allegation he denies, Mabuza told state broadcaster SABC after meeting with Sikhala.He says that this is foul play because when he went out with his uncle for dinner he was not carrying any explosives but those were found as he was driving out.He said he did not come here for explosives but for medical attention.Indeed, Sikhala has been frequenting South Africa for medical help after spending over 500 days in pretrial detention before being released without charge.He was not just kept under the worst conditions but subjected to inhumane treatment over the entire period, which not only cost him his law firm but almost derailed his political career.Jacob Ngarivhume, another opposition figure in Zimbabwean politics described the explosives as having been planted in a post on X that confirmed that his family had been made

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nA FORWARD-THINKING fintech company, EazzyPay, based in Zimbabwe, has officially launched a comprehensive digital payment platform aimed at streamlining both individual and business financial transactions.\n\nThe platform, accessible via mobile app, WhatsApp bot, and web interface, offers a seamless experience for a range of services, from purchasing electricity tokens and airtime to booking event tickets, paying bills, and even accessing corporate solutions like bulk airtime purchases and virtual fiscalisation devices.\n\nEazzyPays launch comes at a time when digital payment adoption in Zimbabwe is accelerating.\n\nAccording to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), the total transaction value processed via digital payment systems reached ZWL 205.49 billion (approx. US$7.78 billion) in August, with 71.42 million transactions recorded. In contrast, cash-based transactions totalled only ZWG 12.66 billion.\n\nSpeaking at the official launch event in Harare, EazzyPays Chief Executive Officer, Tabeth Revesai Nyahasha, emphasised the platforms potential to revolutionise the way Zimbabweans engage with digital finance.\n\nWith our unified approach, we aim to eliminate the inefficiencies that have historically plagued digital payments  from multiple platforms and long wait times to limited access and a lack of transaction transparency, Nyahasha said.\n\nOur mission is to empower communities by offering a faster, more secure, and more accessible payment solution.\n\nThe Zimbabwean fintech landscape is rapidly evolving. Data from the central bank reveals that electronic transactions processed through the National Payment Systems (NPS) grew by 23.09% in Q2 2025, reaching ZWL 655.6 billion (approximately US$24.33 billion). Despite this growth, EazzyPay identified a gap in the market for a unified platform to address the fragmented nature of digital payments, particularly for retail transactions, which accounted for US$5.93 billion in the second quarter alone.\n\nPayments Made Easy  EazzyPays tagline  underscores its core promise: simplifying financial transactions for both individuals and businesses. The platform seeks to increase financial inclusion, particularly in underserved rural areas, by offering a solution that removes barriers such as long queues, restrictive operating hours, and complex user interfaces.\n\nAlex Kuzakwawo, EazzyPays Operations Director, assured users of the platforms robust security features.\n\nWith WhatsApps end-to-end encryption, all transactions are safeguarded, ensuring that only the user has access to their financial information, he explained.\n\nFurthermore, payments are validated by EcoCash, where the users PIN is required for authorization. EazzyPay itself is a facilitator, ensuring that security protocols are strictly adhered to.\n\nAs Zimbabwe continues to transition towards a predominantly digital economy, EazzyPays platform is poised to become a key player in driving both financial inclusion and economic participation across the country. The launch reflects the broader trend of fintech innovation across Africa, where digital solutions are helping bridge the gap between the unbanked and essential financial services.\n\nBy replacing fragmentation with integration, were not just simplifying payments  were enabling a more inclusive, connected economy, added Nyahasha.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA 23-year-old man from Chiredzi, who fatally stabbed a villager after mistaking him for one of his attackers, has been jailed for five years.\n\nJustice Christopher Dube-Banda sitting at the Hight Court at Masvingo convicted Simbarashe Tapera of culpable homicide after he pleaded guilty to the lesser charge, escaping a possible murder conviction.The court heard that on December 22, 2024, Tapera fatally stabbed Edwin Tapera, aged 24, at Murambi village, Chief Nhema in Zaka.According to an agreed statement of facts, the deceased had earlier been assaulted by a group of young men while walking home from Mutembwa business centre around 7pm.Court heard that, as the assailants fled, the accused arrived at the scene with his girlfriend. Mistaken for one of the attackers, he was grabbed by the collar by the deceased, who was holding a stick. In response, Simbarashe drew a knife and stabbed the deceased once in the chest before fleeing.The judge said the accused acted negligently.At the time the accused stabbed the deceased, an attack on him was imminent. However, the means he used to avert the attack were not reasonable in the circumstances, he said.In stabbing the deceased in the manner he did, a reasonable man placed in the same circumstances as the accused would have foreseen the possibility of death and guarded against it. The accused was negligent, and it was his negligence that led to the death of the deceased.The judge noted that although the deceased was the aggressor, the accuseds reaction was excessive and unjustified.The fact is that the accused was not part of the group that harassed the deceased and his companions. He just found himself in a controversy he had nothing to do with; these factors reduce his moral blameworthiness.He, however, stressed that the sanctity of life must be upheld. Society frowns upon a person who, by his violent conduct, causes the death of another human being. The courts must send a loud and clear message that causing the death, albeit negligently, of a fellow human being will not be tolerated, the judge said.The court also considered the Victim Impact Statement, which highlighted the emotional and financial suffering endured by the deceaseds family.Tapera, a first offender and father of one, was sentenced to five years in prison, with one year suspended for five years on condition of good behaviour.The accused, though a young first offender, jumped into crime from the deep end, and he must contend with the consequences. This was negligence of the highest degree, said Justice Dube-Banda.\n\nJustice Christopher Dube-Banda sitting at the Hight Court at Masvingo convicted Simbarashe Tapera of culpable homicide after he pleaded guilty to the lesser charge, escaping a possible murder conviction.\n\nThe court heard that on December 22, 2024, Tapera fatally stabbed Edwin Tapera, aged 24, at Murambi village, Chief Nhema in Zaka.According to an agreed statement of facts, the deceased had earlier been assaulted by a group of young men while walking home from Mutembwa business centre around 7pm.Court heard that, as the assailants fled, the accused arrived at the scene with his girlfriend.

The courts must send a loud and clear message that causing the death, albeit negligently, of a fellow human being will not be tolerated, the judge said.The court also considered the Victim Impact Statement, which highlighted the emotional and financial suffering endured by the deceaseds family.Tapera, a first offender and father of one, was sentenced to five years in prison, with one year suspended for five years on condition of good behaviour.The accused, though a young first offender, jumped into crime from the deep end, and he must contend with the consequences. This was negligence of the highest degree, said Justice Dube-Banda.\n\nThe court heard that on December 22, 2024, Tapera fatally stabbed Edwin Tapera, aged 24, at Murambi village, Chief Nhema in Zaka.\n\nAccording to an agreed statement of facts, the deceased had earlier been assaulted by a group of young men while walking home from Mutembwa business centre around 7pm.Court heard that, as the assailants fled, the accused arrived at the scene with his girlfriend. Mistaken for one of the attackers, he was grabbed by the collar by the deceased, who was holding a stick. In response, Simbarashe drew a knife and stabbed the deceased once in the chest before fleeing.The judge said the accused acted negligently.At the time the accused stabbed the deceased, an attack on him was imminent. However, the means he used to avert the attack were not reasonable in the circumstances, he said.In stabbing the deceased in the manner he did, a reasonable man placed in the same circumstances as the accused would have foreseen the possibility of death and guarded against it. The accused was negligent, and it was his negligence that led to the death of the deceased.The judge noted that although the deceased was the aggressor, the accuseds reaction was excessive and unjustified.The fact is that the accused was not part of the group that harassed the deceased and his companions.

The cost of playing international matches for the Zimbabwe mens soccer team average US$500, 000 to US$750, 000 per match in logistics, accommodation, and lost revenue, depriving the country of potential revenue from hosting these matches, said Jere.The NSS has been undergoing renovations for the past three years, but the work has been progressing at a snails pace, prolonging the return of international football to the country.The Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Anselem Sanyatwe, like his predecessor, Kirsty Coventry, has on numerous occasions failed to meet his own deadlines for the return of international football.In response to Jeres report, the acting Minister of Sports, Arts and Culture, Tinoda Machakaire, said the giant stadium is 65% complete and the government is targeting its approval by the continental football mother body in June 2026.The National Sports Stadium refurbishment is now 65% complete, with bucket seats, turnstiles, and upgraded utilities installed.This project is a model of resilience and accountability in the use of public resources.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE Supreme Court has ruled in favour of Crest Breeders International (Pvt) Ltd, ordering the registration of its compensation agreement with the Government of Zimbabwe over the compulsory acquisition of its 1,057-hectare property and criticising the lower court for revisiting a matter that had already been concluded.\n\nIn a ruling delivered on October 30, 2025, Justices George Chiweshe, Chinembiri Bhunu, and Joseph Musakwa allowed the appeal with costs on the legal practitioner and client scale, setting aside a 2022 Administrative Court decision that had dismissed the companys application.Chiweshe, writing for the court, said the matter was res judicata, having already been determined by the Supreme Court in an earlier judgment. He said the lower court erred in entertaining a matter with regards to which it had previously rendered a determination.Not only was the court a quo functus officio, it disregarded the doctrine of stare decisis by purporting to overturn the decision of this court concerning the same parties, the same facts and the same cause of action, said Chiweshe.The case involved Crest Breeders former property, the remaining extent of Saturday Retreat in Harare, which the government sought to compulsorily acquire in 2013 under the Land Acquisition Act. Following objections, the company and government reached an agreement in which Crest Breeders would retain 407 hectares and be compensated for the remainder. Occupants of the land were to pay four United States dollars per square metre for the portions they occupied.The agreement was initially approved by the Administrative Court and confirmed by the Supreme Court. However, a group of 11 settlers later challenged the registration, claiming the deal was fraudulent and unfair. In 2022, the Administrative Court sided with the settlers, a decision which has now been overturned.The Supreme Court said the settlers had no legitimate claim to the property or the agreement.If truth be told, the core respondents are illegal settlers, with no legitimate claim to the appellants property, he said.They were not privy to the agreement nor were they adversely affected by its terms.He said the respondents had no locus standi to challenge the deal since they were neither parties to the agreement nor recognised beneficiaries of the land reform programme.The core respondents embarked from the very beginning on a futile exercise to assert what they perceived to be their rights, he said.The court reaffirmed the States right to acquire private land in the public interest upon payment of compensation.The sovereign State of Zimbabwe has eminent domain over all private property within its territory and can acquire such property in the public interest against payment of compensation.The judges ordered that the memorandum of agreement between Crest Breeders and the Government of Zimbabwe be registered in terms of the Administrative Court (Land Acquisition) Rules of 1998.They also ordered the settlers to pay costs of the appeal on the legal practitioner and client scale.Despite glaring shortcomings, the core respondents persisted with their claims, thereby putting the appellant unnecessarily out of pocket. The appellants request for costs on the attorney and client scale was meritorious, the court ruled.Crest Breeders was represented by Advocate Lewis Uriri and T.S. Nyawo of Nyawo Ruzive Attorneys, while the Ministry of Lands was represented by L.T. Muradzikwa.The settlers were represented by J. Koto of Koto & Company.\n\nIn a ruling delivered on October 30, 2025, Justices George Chiweshe, Chinembiri Bhunu, and Joseph Musakwa allowed the appeal with costs on the legal practitioner and client scale, setting aside a 2022 Administrative Court decision that had dismissed the companys application.\n\nChiweshe, writing for the court, said the matter was res judicata, having already been determined by the Supreme Court in an earlier judgment.

Why do you believe so many Zimbabweans are running away? It was not always the case. What changed?\n\nRespectfully to what extent has South Africa, through successive administrations, taken an honest view about the Zimbabwean crisis?\n\nUnless these questions are addressed, you will most likely continue to have hordes of Zimbabweans braving high fences, vicious crocodiles, the vagaries of the Limpopo and your law enforcement in order to escape the bigger crocodiles back home, said Mahere.\n\nNumerous attempts by South Africa to curb illegal migration from Zimbabwe have been futile, prompting vigilante groups to attack foreign nationals.\n\nRamaphosa said his government is holding engagements with countries whose nationals are in South Africa illegally.\n\nEngagements with countries whose nationals are frequent transgressors are ongoing through discussions with embassies, and these matters are also included as an Agenda item on Bi-National Commissions. This is to ensure that the implication of illegal migration is understood.\n\nIllegal immigration does place a strain on our social services and undermines our national security.\n\nWe should not allow vigilante acts targeting foreign nationals as these do not solve the problem and they undermine the rule of law, said Ramaphosa.\n\n",

It will feature exhibitions, investment sessions, expert panel discussions, and will conclude with an awards gala celebrating outstanding achievers in the diaspora.\n\nDescribed as a premier diaspora engagement platform, the event has become an important avenue for companies and organisations seeking to expand into both the local and diaspora markets.\n\nThe organisers said the summit will bring together prospective investors while recognising individuals making notable contributions to the countrys progress.\n\nThe 3rd Edition of the Zimbabwe Diaspora Celebration & Business Summit is more than a gathering; it is a national initiative celebrating the indispensable role of Zimbabweans abroad in driving economic transformation.\n\nAccording to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, the diaspora community remitted an impressive US$2.2 billion in 2024, up from US$1.873 billion in 2023. This growth underscores the diasporas unwavering commitment to Zimbabwes socio-economic progress, said ZIDO chaiperson Blessed Kapesa.\n\nAn estimated 300 in-person participants and thousands of online viewers from around the world are expected to take part in the event.\n\nWith an expected attendance of at least 300 in-person participants and thousands of online viewers worldwide, the summit is strategically scheduled during the festive season, when many Zimbabweans in the diaspora return home.\n\nThis hybrid platform will enable participants to showcase their products, services, and investment opportunities to a global audience, amplifying visibility and engagement, he added.\n\n",
