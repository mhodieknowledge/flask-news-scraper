            "content": "DW\n\nKirsty Coventry will make sporting history if she is electedpresident of the International Olympic Committee (IOC)at its General Assembly on Thursday (March 20,2025). She would be the first woman and first person from Africa to head the IOC.\n\nShe would also be the youngest since Pierre de Coubertin, the founding father of the modernOlympic Games. The Frenchman founded the IOC in 1894 and took over the presidency two years later at the age of 33.\n\nCoventry, a 41-year-old former world-class swimmer fromZimbabwe, has always had a strong will and vision.\n\nWhen I was 9 years old, I told my dad I wanted to go to the Olympics and win gold. He told me it would be a rough road ahead, he explained how difficult it was just to make the Olympic team let alone win a medal, but he believed in me, she wrote in a Facebook post a few years ago.\n\nAt the age of 20, she made her dream come true. At the 2004 Games in Athens, Coventry won the gold medal in the 200-meter backstroke. Four years later, in 2008 in Beijing, she won gold again. In addition to those two gold medals, she collected four Olympic silver medals and one bronze. This makes Coventry Africas most successful female Olympian of all time. The only African who has had more success at the Olympics is long-distance runner Tirunesh Dibaba of Ethiopia  who won three gold medals (and two bronze).\n\nI have been to five Olympic Games, won seven individual Olympic medals, broken multiple world records and had one of the best World Championship careers of all time, Coventry wrote on her Linkedin profile.\n\nHowever, none of this is as important as what this success did and can do for others. It united my country where divisions caused by economic and political turmoil were crippling it, and it gave hope to people who thought their circumstances prevented them from following their dreams.\n\nWhile still an active swimmer, Coventry was elected to the IOC Athletes Commission in 2013. She represented the interests of athletes for eight years, including three years as chairperson. More recently, she has been a member of the IOC Executive Board.\n\nThe increased influence of the Zimbabwean has raised hopes in Africa that the Summer Olympics could be hosted on the African continent for the first time.\n\nAlthoughSouth AfricaandEgypthave expressed their interest, Coventry has played down such expectations.\n\nThe interest is there and now we need to ensure that were working closely with all of these countries that are interested so that they fully understand the magnitude of the Olympic Games, she said.\n\nThe countries of Africa, Coventry said in a Q&A session organized by the Association of International Sports Journalists (AIPS), should really strategically look from the African Union point of view on how we can develop through the All Africa Games our infrastructure that can then be followed up and used by an Olympic Games bid.\n\nCoventry knows from experience just how tough such political processes can be. She has been Zimbabwes Minister of Sport since 2018. She says she now has definitely a thicker skin than she used toas an athlete.\n\nWhen asked whether she thinks trans women should be allowed to compete in womens competitions, she was evasive.\n\n100% it is necessary to find a solution, Coventry said. I think that we as the IOC have to take a little bit more of a leadership role.\n\nThe Zimbabwean also avoided going too far out on a limb on another hot topic before the IOC election: the possibility of Russian and Belarusian athletes competing at the Olympics.\n\nI think above anything else its our duty as the IOC to ensure that all athletes can participate at the Games, she said. Thats going to look different for a number of different athletes but at the end of the day I do believe that we need to find a holistic way of sadly dealing with athletes from conflict areas.\n\nShe was speaking in light of her experience competing for Zimbabwe at a time when the country was in political turmoil and under international sanctions.\n\nIt could have been very easy for the international community to not allow us to take part. I look at (it) and say what would my life be today? I am grateful that I was not held accountable for what the leaders and governments were doing.\n\nKirsty Coventry is not only a sports administrator and politician, but also a mother. She gave birth to her second daughter less than six months ago. Her eldest is six years old.\n\nBy the time she was one year old, she had already been to 10 different countries around the world, Coventry said.\n\nI have an incredible network of support from my husband and family. This is a normal way of life for us. I think its a good way to show that women are just as capable as men even if we are to be expected to be full-time mothers, wives, daughters etc.\n\nWe still have a lot of work to do, and I am excited about leading this movement, Coventry said of gender equality. Women are ready to lead. I look at it as an opportunity to push through boundaries so that when my two girls are growing up, they dont have the same boundaries.\n\n",

The advent of AI and automation is reshaping traditional employment structures, raising concerns about job security, fair wages and protection of workers rights.\n\nAs AI continues to permeate into workplaces new forms of labour disputes may arise necessitating adaptative and forward-looking dispute resolution mechanisms that account for algorithm decision making, data privacy and equitable access to opportunities, he said.\n\nSpeaking at a different event during the same week, UN resident coordinator, Edward Kallon said AI presents both opportunities and threats.\n\nUnited Nations resident coordinator Edward Kallon said AI was a key driver of the fourth industrial revolution.\n\nIn view of these realities, countries across the globe are increasingly positioning themselves to take full advantage of opportunities presented by these technological innovations and in particular, artificial intelligence, to advance their respective national development agendas and, consequently, transform the lives of their citizens.\n\nIt is, however, also true that as transformative as these technologies are, there are many risks associated with them, both inherent and overt, that cannot be overlooked and hence must be addressed by countries to ensure the development and application of AI systems in both the public and private sectors are ethically compliant, he said.\n\n",

A faction loyal to Mnangagwa is advocating for the suspension of the 2028 elections to allow him to remain in power until 2030 and the other, believed to be aligned to Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, pushing for adherence to the constitutional term limits.\n\nWhile Mnangagwa has called himself a constitutionalist who will not remain in power beyond the constitutionally stipulated two terms, he has not publicly rebuked those pushing for his stay.\n\nZNLWVA is among those against Mnangagwas third term and is backing outspoken war veteran Blessed Geza who has been publicly criticising the 2030 agenda.\n\nGeza has gone into hiding after police launched a manhunt for him on four charges, including inciting public violence and defying the Presidents authority.\n\n",

Scottland then convincingly beat CAPS United 2-0 in the following encounter.\n\nNgezi Platinum then handed Scottland their first defeat in the league with a 1-0 victory. The defeat miffed Sakupwanya who left the stadium 30 minutes after the encounter as he struggled to terms with the result.\n\nNdiraya, albeit seeing light on the upside, said Scottland has to be up for a gruelling challenge in the PSL.\n\nThe good thing is people are coming to watch the games and partly because of the players we have in our team.

The cloth contained one or another detergent which burned her mouth and throat, said Nathanson.\n\nHe said the woman was in hospital receiving treatment.\n\nNathanson said that these crimes were becoming common, especially with domestic workers who become like family.\n\nShe was with my client for many years. She even took care of her sick daughter, who passed away a few months ago. They knew each other well and she clearly trusted her domestic worker, said Nathanson.\n\nHe said that he had seen many cases of the elderly being attacked by their domestic workers.\n\nIts common in the Indian community for domestic workers to attack their employers. They know Indians have expensive jewellery like gold, so they target them.\n\nThey go as far as to demand 18ct jewellery when they are robbing them because they know the older Indian ladies always have expensive gold. The elderly can get very hurt just because their domestic workers want their valuables, said Nathanson.\n\nHe said that at times, domestic workers could be treated badly by their employers.\n\nThe employers think that the domestic workers are silly and dont notice their valuables. So they then bide their time. They leave them alone at home for hours and in that time they search for things to steal.It doesnt matter how someone speaks to you, you cannot rob them, said Nathanson.\n\nHe said the elderly need to be cautious of who they hire.\n\nNot everyone you employ as a domestic worker would have good intentions. You need to be careful because once they are over the border with your valuables, the chances are you will never be able to recover them.\n\nMany times you see that employers dont have details about their domestic workers. They just take them off the street and pay them for a days work. That is dangerous, said Nathanson.\n\niFacts, a provider of employee screening services, warned that doing background checks on employees were vital.\n\nRecently, we have read of people being attacked and murdered by their domestic workers and others who have stolen considerable money and items of great value.\n\nDomestic staff can be perceived as members of the family. This level of trust can cause families to underestimate the possibility that a disgruntled or untrustworthy employee might become a risk to the family by sharing information with syndicates, simply stealing to improve their lifestyle, or, sadly, going as far as to harm the family.\n\nThus, the hiring decision regarding the domestic service provider demands great care and caution, and often, people are guided by emotions and skip the essential background checks, saidiFactson their website.\n\nThey said some families took the word of agencies that the domestic worker had been checked.\n\nWhen a person is appointed to work in your home, it is strongly recommended that you ask for a copy of the background check.\n\n",
