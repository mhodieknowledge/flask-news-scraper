            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nLISTED financial powerhouse, FBC Bank, has blamed the tight policy measures employed by the Central Bank for significantly choking transaction volumes at the institution.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) pledged to maintain a tight monetary policy stance throughout the year to stabilise its newly introduced currency by keeping the key interest rates at 35%. A tight grip on liquidity has also been maintained since then.\n\nPresenting a trading update for the quarter ended March 31 2025, FBC group company secretary, Tichaona Mabeza, said while the measures have gone a long way to support stability, business volumes were severely affected.\n\nLocally, Zimbabwes economy experienced relative stability concerning inflation and exchange rates, despite the global macroeconomic pressures. This is because of a tight monetary policy stance that aims to foster market stability, enhance market confidence and provide a basis for sustainable growth. The tight monetary policy stance has, however, adversely impacted the volume of transactions and lending activities, said Mabeza.\n\nOn the other hand, FBC said tight liquidity conditions also adversely affected trading on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE), resulting in the All-Share index dropping by 5.7%\n\nMeanwhile ,during the period, the group reported a profit before tax of ZWG 94.5 million. Total income stood at ZWG 578 million, with net fee and commission income contributing ZWG 337 million, highlighting the groups strategic pivot towards fee-based revenue, to reduce exposure to currency and interest rate volatility.\n\nNet interest income remained robust at ZWG 321 million, demonstrating the continued strength of core trading activities. Total assets amounted to ZWG 19.9 billion, underpinned by a strong loan portfolio of ZWG 9.56 billion.\n\nShareholders equity closed at ZWG 5. 7 billion, reflecting the Groups ongoing focus on safeguarding and growing long-term shareholder value.\n\nLocally, the current tight fiscal and monetary policy positions will likely remain until the macroeconomic targets are within range. The Group will prioritise efficient capital deployment, pursue growth opportunities in key economic sectors and improve operational efficiency, driven by innovation and technology investments, added Mabeza.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Supreme Court has struck off the roll appeals by Sengezo Tshabangu and the Speaker of Parliament, who were challenging a High Court ruling blocking the recall of legislators from the Citizens Coalition for Coalition (CCC) faction led by Welshman Ncube.\n\nThis follows a realisation that there was no court order on the ruling from the lower court.\n\nA bench comprising Justices Chinembiri Bhunu, Felistas Chatukuta and Lavender Makoni struck the appeals off the roll, ruling that the matter should be heard afresh.\n\nHaving considered submissions by counsel, the court issues the following order.\n\nThe matter on Sc24/25 and SC 26/25be and are hereby struck off the roll (appeal by the Speaker of the National Assembly and the appeal by Tshabangu).\n\nIn the exercise of this courts review powers it is ordered that the proceedings in the High Court be and is hereby set aside.\n\nThe matter is hereby remitted to the court a quo (High Court) for hearing de novo before a different judge, Bhunu.\n\nWhen court sat on Thursday a lawyer representing CCC, Method Ndlovu challenged the courts jurisdiction, arguing that the case was supposed to be heard by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe hearing, however, took a twist after it emerged that there was no written court order from the High Court formalising its ruling.\n\nOnce there is no order, then there is no appeal. You cannot make an appeal on an order which does not exist. The court cannot panel beat a judgement from the court a quo to make it fit the record, said Ndlovu.\n\nLewis Uriri, representing Tshabangu, agreed that there was no judgment from the High Court.\n\nHe then said without that court order the Supreme Court had powers to set aside the judgment of the High Court.\n\nThe prayer that we seek is that the appeal succeeds and the judgment of the High Court is set aside and remitted back to the High Court.\n\nThere is no operative part of the judgement as such we do not have an appeal. So may the court remit back the matter to the High Court de novo with a different judge, he said.\n\nThe court ruled in Uriris favour.\n\nCommenting on the development, Uriri said. In essence, the High Court wrote an essay.\n\nBecause we have an issue, which is not a speaking judgment, those proceedings have been set aside, and the matter has been returned to the High Court for a fresh hearing before a different judge.\n\nNdlovu begged to differ, The two appeals were not properly before the court because they were appealing against an order which did not exist. The Supreme Court stated that the High Courts judgment did not provide a disposition or an operative part. The appeals were struck off the roll, with each party bearing its own costs. The matter was remitted to the High Court to be heard by a different judge. The dispute remains very live. Justice Wamambo had declared the reshuffling of the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders unlawful, and that matter will now be heard afresh. No one won.\n\nLast year, CCC leaders, including the interim party leader, Welshman Ncube and his deputy, Lynette Karenyi Kore, Sesel Zvidzai and Edwin Mushoriwa, filed an application citing their party as the first applicant.\n\nTshabangu had dismissed the leaders from their parliamentary roles and appointed his selections in their place.\n\nAs a result, they sued Tshabangu and Mlotshwa, seeking a court declaration that Tshabangus decisions to oust them from the Standing Rules and Orders Committee (SROC) were unlawful and exceeded his constitutional authority.\n\nThey also challenged Mlotshwas appointment as the CCC chief whip, claiming that such a position is not recognised under Section 151 (2) of the Constitution.\n\nThey also said the reshuffling of various CCC members across different parliamentary committees to which they were originally assigned.\n\nThey sought an order to prevent the Speaker from announcing these changes in the National Assembly.\n\nTheir challenge was upheld by High Court judge Justice Neville Wamambo, prompting Tshabangu to approach the Supreme Court.\n\n",

Care workers from overseas have made a huge contribution, but too many have been subject to abuse and exploitation, the UK Home Office announced via its official X account on May 12.Were moving away from our dependence on overseas workers to restore control and fairness to the system.\n\nIndia, Nigeria and Zimbabwe have been the three biggest sources of care workers migrating to the UK since it began offering them such visas. According to UK Home Office data, 15,709 care-worker visas were issued to Zimbabwean nationals in 2023, while Nigerians received 19,449, including dependents.\n\nThe visa cancellation is part of a wider clampdown on immigration under Prime Minister Keir Starmers government, which is facing increasing pressure to reduce migrant numbers amid growing support for anti-immigration parties like Nigel Farages Reform UK, according toBloomberg.\n\nFor many Zimbabweans, the permits had offered a lifeline, an opportunity to escape an economy marked by instability and inflation. Over the years, Zimbabwes currency has been one of the worlds worst performers.\n\nThe countrys latest attempt at monetary stability, thegold-backed ZiG, marks its sixth currency experiment in just 15 years. Despite its promise, the ZiG has yet to gain meaningful traction. In September, the central bank devalued the ZiG by 43% to narrow the gulf between official and black-market exchange rates.\n\nThe migration surge has triggered a significant brain drain in Zimbabwe, depleting the country of skilled professionals, not only in health care but also across critical sectors such as banking, accounting, and information technology, said Memory Nguwi, managing consultant at Industrial Psychology Consultants, a Harare-based HR advisory firm.\n\nZimbabwean authorities have raised concerns that the exodus of nurses and doctors to the UK has created a severe gap in the countrys already fragile healthcare system.\n\n",

The disputed additional assessments amount to US$74.8 million.\n\nManagement continues to engage with ZIMRA while appealing some legal and factual issues of the assessments and the judgments, with guidance from tax experts and legal counsel. These assessments have a material impact on the Groups operations, if they materialise as per the extant assessments, he said.\n\nMoyo described the ambiguities in the tax legislation as pervasive, thereby creating risks of further disagreements in interpretations and application to current taxes.\n\nMeanwhile, during the period, group revenue for the year at US$807 million increased by 5% compared to the restated prior year figures, reflecting the volume growth in Lager Beer and the sugar tax-induced price increases in sparkling beverages.\n\nThe proportion of domestic sales undertaken in foreign currency was around 80% for most of the year, although there were periodic shifts in response to the performance of the formal retail sector, which was affected by exchange rate disparities and the level of enforcement of the dual pricing regulations.\n\nOperating Income (Earnings before interest and tax) is indicated at US$153 million, which is in line with the prior year. Profit before tax is indicated at US$139.9 million compared to US$104.4 million for the prior year. It is noted that the prior year comparative figures included currency-related distortions.\n\nThe trading margins in the current period were partly affected by the under recovery on the sugar tax and the higher cost of imported maize. It is highlighted that an equivalent of US$20.7 million was paid as sugar tax by Delta Beverages and Schweppes Zimbabwe during the current year.\n\nThe operating environment in Zimbabwe remains complex, influenced by policy changes and currency instability. The beverages sector faces further challenges relating to uncompetitive retail prices arising from high input costs and taxes which attract lower-priced imports from the region and policy-driven changes to the route to market.\n\nWe continue to urge the authorities to implement policies that would ensure the stability of the local currency and access to foreign currency through the banking channels or through trading, added Moyo.\n\n",

These steps are paramount to safeguarding the fundamental rights of all Zimbabweans.\n\nThe ZPP warned that without deliberate action to reverse these disturbing trends, the pursuit of sustainable peace, democracy, and justice remains critically undermined.\n\nThe government, as well as local authorities, have also been implicated as perpetrators of human rights violations.\n\nAccording to the report, Zanu PF committed over thirty-four percent of the total of all human rights violations recorded by the peace watchdog in April 2025.\n\nAnalysis of the data indicates that individuals affiliated with the ruling party, ZANU PF, were responsible for 34.1% of the reported violations, the report stated.\n\nThe ZPP also fingered the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) as one of the main perpetrators of human rights violation, alleging that about six percent of the total rights violations cases were committed by the military.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) accounted for 24.1% of the perpetrators, while local councils were responsible for 15.64%. The Zimbabwe National Army contributed 6.41%, and government officials 4.62%, the report detailed, highlighting the wide net of responsibility for the abuses.\n\nAccording to the report, Masvingo Province recorded the highest number of violations with 20 cases, followed by Harare Province with 14, mirroring the same patterns observed in March 2025.\n\nOther provinces included Manicaland 12, Mashonaland Central 13, Mashonaland East 11, and Mashonaland West 12. The situation remains bleak across much of the country.\n\nMidlands Province reportedly recorded a decrease in reported incidents, from 14 in March to five in April. Bulawayo 1 (one), Matabeleland North 2 (two), and Matabeleland South 3 (three) reported significantly fewer violations.\n\nOn a positive note, ZPP says apart from the worrying human rights violations trend in the country, the High Court ruling last month that justified the University of Zimbabwe (UZ) lecturers industrial strike offered a glimmer of hope.\n\nDespite the worrying trends, the month also brought a positive development in the form of a High Court ruling affirming the constitutional right to strike by the University of Zimbabwes Association of University Teachers (AUT), the report noted, providing a chink of light in what is otherwise a very dark tunnel.\n\n",
