            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nWAR Veterans farming at Springs Farm have pushed back against government-assisted attempts by top businessman Billy Rautenbach to grab their land.\n\nLocal Government Minister Daniel Garwe, who in the past has been fingered in attempts to repossess land reserved for Parliamentarians, stands accused in the scandal that could likely displace hundreds.\n\nAccording to documents gleaned by NewZimbabwe.com, his Ministry is seeking to reopen a case that could grant Rautenbach ownership of land the High Court already decided was not his.\n\nThe war vets, under the Springs Farmers Association, have filed their intent to oppose the ministrys application, arguing that the government cannot relitigate a matter that was final and conclusive and that any further interference puts Zimbabwes land-reform credibility at stake.\n\nThe dispute centres on a March 2025 offer letter issued by Local Government Minister Daniel Garwe, allocating 671 hectares at Springs Farm and 412 hectares at Stuhm to Marimba Residential Properties (Pvt) Ltd as final compensation for land in Aspindale Park, Lochinvar, and Salisbury Park that the company claims to have lost years ago.\n\nHowever, the courts have already ruled on the matter.\n\nIn 2019, the High Court found that businessman Rautenbach and his associated companies had no valid title to the Aspindale property, affirming that the land had been lawfully acquired by the State and allocated to housing co-operatives under the National Housing Delivery Programme.\n\nThat ruling, described by the judge as final and definitive, was never overturned.\n\nDocuments show that while Marimba claims to have lost about 180 hectares in Aspindale, the new offer compensates it with over 1,100 hectares of prime farmland, six times the size and far higher in market and agricultural value.\n\nThe paper trail surrounding Marimba Residential Properties raises more questions than answers.\n\nThe Registrar of Companies confirmed in 2018 that Marimba Residential Properties and Marimba Industrial Properties are not registered companies in our database.\n\nAt the same time, the Registrar of Deeds admitted that the title deed purportedly linking Marimba to the Aspindale property is missing from the record.\n\nDespite those gaps, the company continues to feature in official correspondence and now, in the new compensation offer.\n\nIn their newly filed opposition, the farmers accuse the government of attempting to rescind a ruling made on the merits, which the law does not allow.\n\nThey describe the governments filing as a composite application that is procedurally and substantively defective, arguing that it merges three distinct processes: review, rescission, and interdict into a single motion, something the farmers lawyers say is jurisprudentially untenable.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nPermanent Secretary in the Ministry of Information and Publicity, Nick Mangwana, says government restricted public access to the Mbuya Nehanda statue in Harares Central Business District following several attempts of vandalism.\n\nThe statue, unveiled by President Emmerson Mnangagwa in 2021, cost the State a substantial amount of money.\n\nSince its unveiling, the monument which stands at the corner of Julius Nyerere Way and Samora Machel Avenue has been inaccessible to the public, with police officers stationed to guard it.\n\nThe monument was initially accessible to the public. Unfortunately, after a rise in visitor numbers and repeated vandalism attempts, including people trying to push it over or deface it, access had to be restricted, said Mangwana in a post on X.\n\nHe added that government is now working on measures to reopen access to the statue.\n\nTo enable safe public viewing of the Mbuya Nehanda statue, while protecting the iconic monument, the government is creating a new access framework. The President has instructed that this be implemented as soon as possible. We take this opportunity to apologize to the public for the delayed access, he said.\n\nMangwanas response follows criticism after international travel vlogger Davud Akhundzada was denied access to the statue during a recent visit.\n\nAuthorities came under fire for missing an opportunity to market Zimbabwes capital city.\n\nIn a statement, the Ministry of Tourism and Hospitality Industry distanced itself from the incident, saying responsibility for the monument lies with the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage.\n\nWe wish to clarify that the Mbuya Nehanda Statue is a National Heritage Monument managed by the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage. It stands as a proud symbol of Zimbabwes liberation history and identity.\n\nThe site is subject to specific preservation and security protocols and as such, public access to certain areas, including elevated or restricted zones, may be limited for safety, preservation and security reasons.\n\nHowever, as the Ministry of Tourism and Hospitality Industry, we are taking proactive steps to enhance tourist management at such sites. Through a Whole-of-Government Approach Strategy, in coordination with our counterparts at the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage, we are in the process of deploying tourism officers at key heritage and cultural monuments. These officers will facilitate seamless, well-informed and welcoming access for tourists, ensuring a positive experience while safeguarding our national heritage, read the statement.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nResidents of Glenview, one of Harares cholera hotspots, have petitioned Mayor Jacob Mafume to stop the planned demolition of a public borehole that serves more than 2,800 people.\n\nThe move follows a 48-hour removal notice issued by the City of Harare, ordering the clearing of the borehole site to pave way for four residential infill stands. The council cited illegal occupation under municipal by-laws.\n\nThe borehole, drilled in 2019 under the Presidential Borehole Scheme, remains the communitys main source of clean water in an area already suffering from severe shortages. No alternative water source has been proposed to replace it.\n\nIn a petition signed by 280 residents and submitted to the mayor on Wednesday, the community urged council to form a special committee to investigate the land allocations and assess how many boreholes would be affected by the planned housing development.\n\nThe Petitioner beseeches the Harare City Council to establish a Special Committee pursuant to Section 100 of the Urban Councils Act (Chapter 29:15), conduct an investigation into the allocation of infill residential stands in Glen View, determine the number of boreholes that will be affected, and provide recommendations to mitigate the water supply issues that may arise from the removal of the boreholes, the petition reads in part.\n\nResidents warned that demolishing the borehole without providing an alternative water source would violate their constitutional right to water and risk triggering another public health crisis in the cholera-prone suburb.\n\nThey also questioned how stands approved in 2024 could overlap with a borehole installed in 2018 and upgraded in 2025, describing the sequence as evidence of poor planning and possible corruption.\n\nAdding to their frustration, residents said individuals allocated the contested stands have already begun bringing building materials to the site, despite the ongoing dispute.\n\nThe petitioners further demanded that the City of Harare convene a public meeting to release documents showing whether the land was properly allocated before the borehole was drilled.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nFinance Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube has claimed that the majority of Zimbabweans have entered the upper-middle-income bracket, even as most citizens continue to grapple with low wages and rising living costs.\n\nThe World Bank classifies an upper middle-income economy as one with a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita between US$4,046 and US$12,535. In an ideal setting, this level of income would reflect improved living standards for ordinary citizens through equitable distribution of national wealth.\n\nAddressing delegates at the 2026 Pre-Budget Seminar in Bulawayo on Wednesday, Ncube painted a rosy picture of Zimbabwes economy, adding that most citizens are already spending above the daily threshold associated with middle-income economies.\n\nSo, the minimum GNI per capita should be US$4,500 per person, and this is an annual figure. That means that you ought to be able to spend on any given day no less than US$12 per person. Currently, on average, with the GNI per capita of US$3,300, that implies that we are spending US$9 per day, Ncube said.\n\nHe attributed the progress to the successful implementation of the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1), which he said drove the economy to an average growth rate of 5.6% between 2021 and 2025, surpassing the official target of 5.2%, buoyed by increased infrastructure development. Ncube added that the economy is forecast to expand by 6.6% this year.\n\nHis statement, however, contrasts sharply with the lived reality of many Zimbabweans. The majority of the working population continues to earn less than US$250 per month, while a significant portion of the labour force operates in the informal sector, struggling to meet daily needs amid rising inflation and a weakening local currency.\n\n",

As this was happening, Amour, who was a passenger in the truck, led officers to the loading box where there were lunch boxes wrapped in foil and loaded among bags of beans. He opened one of the boxes and started eating spaghetti in a bid to divert their attention.\n\nSome of the officers conducted a further search, leading to the discovery of more boxes containing methamphetamine hidden in a specially designed compartment on the roof of the truck.\n\nSensing danger, the driver and another passenger fled the scene, but the offender was arrested before he could escape. The truck was subsequently seized and forfeited to the State.\n\nIn a statement following sentencing, the National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) said drug misuse and trafficking in harmful substances were destroying lives and communities across the country hence the need for stiffer sentences against peddlers.\n\nCases like this highlight the serious consequences of choosing the drug trade over honest living. Let this be a warning to all, the law is watching and the courts are taking a firm stance, the NPAZ noted.\n\n",
