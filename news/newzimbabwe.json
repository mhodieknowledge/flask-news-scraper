The rise of this blank, totally vacuous comrado eliteso proximate to the seat of powerspells trouble for Zimbabwe, said Biti.\n\nFormer opposition MP Tendai Biti\n\nTagwirei, through his proxies, has secured lucrative government contracts, including a multimillion-dollar deal to construct the Mbudzi Interchange flyover.\n\nHis business empire has expanded into mining, and he holds a near-monopoly in Zimbabwes fuel sector.\n\nAdditionally, he oversees the controversial Command Agriculture programme and chairs the Land Tenure Implementation Committee.\n\nHis company, Sakunda Holdings, was implicated in the misappropriation of $3 billion from the Ministry of Agriculture between 2017 and 2018.\n\nThe United States of America sanctioned Tagwirei for allegedly enabling corruption among senior government officials.\n\nThough Tagwirei has remained silent, his name continues to circulate as a potential successor to Mnangagwa amid ZANU-PFs internal factional battles.\n\nBiti further argued that the decline of liberation-era war veterans has created a vacuum, allowing opportunistic figures like Tagwireiderisively termed zvigananda (parasites)to exploit their proximity to power for political gain:\n\nThe vacuum left by the departure of the liberation generation is being filled by parasitic comrades with no social base, no shame, and no restraintindividuals who conflate themselves with the state.

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nZANU PF legislators, Wednesday grilled Mines and Mining DevelopmentDeputy Minister Polite Kambamura over delays in the tabling of the Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill in the National Assembly.\n\nThe MP alleged that Zimbabweans rights to mining were being undermined as the bill has been kept out of Parliament for too long.\n\nAs of March 26, 2025, the Bill status reads: Bill proofs transmitted to Attorney Generals Office.\n\nGokwe-Kabuyuni MP Spencer Tshuma said the delays in amending the bill had a negative bearing on how mining rights were awarded to citizens, as foreign nationals have an upper hand, leaving out hungry locals.\n\nDuring the question and answer (Q and A) session,Tshuma alleged thatlocals were also being charged the same fees asforeigners.\n\nLooking at the delays in the Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill to this August House so that it is reviewed, what is government doing to ensure that those who are in mining will be accorded different rights from foreign miners?\n\nWe are noting that at the moment they are treated the same from the monies that they pay during the pegging of mines and even in paying their taxes, and that our local people are given rights as citizens of this nation compared to foreigners.\n\nWe have been anticipating this new law for quite some time, and it has been a long time since the 9th Parliament. What is happening, Madam Speaker, is that mining is going on and our minerals are being exploited whilst we are waiting for the law? Tshuma said.\n\nLegislators have in the past also accused the government of mortgaging minerals to foreigners at the expense of citizens who are languishing in poverty.\n\nFurther, Tshuma demanded an explanation on the delays from the deputy minister.\n\nSo, may the Hon. Minister explain how long it is going to take and the challenges that are preventing the new law from coming to this august House so that it is tabled in Parliament and discussed, instead of foreign companies coming to take all the money? Tshuma said.\n\nMedia reports have shown that Chinese-owned companies are flooding the mining sector, violating Environmental and Mining laws, causing devastating land degradation.\n\nGoromonzi West constituency MP Biata Beatrice Karimatsenga-Nyamupinga on EPOs said: When local people apply so that they get the applications processed, they do not succeed, but foreign miners are found mining in schools and in other protected places or in other gazetted places.\n\nOur locals should be able to go to such places and their applications must also be treated with priority over the foreign applications.\n\nZanu PF Rushinga MP Tendai Nyabani urged the Mines Ministry to follow up on miners as most cheat on the value and type of mineral being mined, thereby paying less royalties to the State.\n\nWill the government make a follow-up to check exactly what the miner is mining for, because sometimes they might peg mining minerals of lesser value, yet they are mining some precious minerals?\n\nKambamura saidthat all raised issues would be looked at in the new bill.\n\nWe are reviewing and are going to be looking at these issues. When someone comes from outside the country to bring investment, they should have a substantial investment.\n\nWe cannot just allow people who come into the mining sector without a significant amount of investment.\n\nWe are going to enact a law that stipulates that foreign investors should give locals opportunities to be employed. We have noticed that most investors bring their workers from their countries, who sometimes do not share the technical expertise with locals, the deputy minister responded.\n\nKambamura assured the legislatorsthat locals are going to be prioritised in the next few months.\n\nWe are going to ensure that small-scale miners or the sector will only be for black local Zimbabweans.\n\nRegarding delays in gazetting of the bill, he explained: In the past few days, we gazetted the Act and some sections were noted that needed editing.\n\nSo, the Attorney Generals Office is reviewing such errors, such mistakes which are going to be corrected then it will be regazetted.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nHigh Court judge, Justice Joel Mambara has ordered a Masvingo woman, Eugenia Machaya to pay US$25,000 adultery damages to the wife of a man she snatched six years ago.\n\nA default order was granted in favour of the complainant, Viola Dhudhla Machingura after Machaya failed to attend pretrial meetings.\n\nMachingura had sued Machaya for US$50,000 after she invaded her 41-year-old marriage.\n\nBroken down, US$30,000 was for contumelia and US$20,000 was for loss of consortium, arising from a protracted adulterous relationship between Machaya and her husband.\n\nThe court heard the relationship started in 2019 and Machaya now has two children with Dhudhlas husband.\n\nThe plaintiff, a retired university lecturer and church elder, testified through affidavit to public humiliation in her congregation and community, severe emotional trauma requiring medical treatment for diabetes, hypertension and depression, and the stripping away of her role in the family estate (bank accounts, farm operations and vehicles), the court heard.\n\nSince 2019 the plaintiffs husband has cohabited with the defendant; intimacy, companionship and joint family life have ceased entirely. The marriage now subsists only in name, court papers further show.\n\nMachaya, despite the service, elected to remain absent and therefore offered no apology or mitigation.\n\nThematter was set down on the unopposed roll afterherplea was struck out for non-attendance at the pre-trial conference and her subsequent application for rescission was deemed abandoned.\n\nLiabilitywas therefore not in issueand the courtwas onlyseized with the assessment of quantum under r 25(1) of the High Court Rules, 2021.\n\nWhile handing down his judgement, Justice Mambara said that when fixing adultery damages, the court considers the nature and duration of the marriage, knowledge of the marriage by the adulterer, character and social-economic standing of the parties and the extent of contumelia and loss of consortium proved.\n\nThe judge also looked into contrition (or lack thereof) by the adulterer, the need for deterrence, and the level of awards in comparable cases.\n\nMambara said there is no reported High Court decision afterthat ofTaoneyivs Madzima (HH 18-25)has exceeded the composite figure of US$20,000.\n\nInflation-adjusted though that award is, it remains the highest recent comparable award placed before the court, he said.\n\nThe judge said the plaintiff had along, otherwise stable marriage.\n\nHe said there was a total lack of contrition by Machaya, adding that such offenders deserve deterrent penalties.\n\nThe court is satisfied that an award modestly above the most recent ceiling of US $20,000 is justified to reflect both changing economic realities and the egregious facts of this case.\n\nAccordingly, it is ordered that the defendant shall pay to the plaintiff the sum of US $25,000 made up as follows:(a) Contumelia: US$16,000 (b) Loss of consortium: US$9,000.\n\nHe ruled that interest shall run on the above amount at the prescribed rate of 5 % per annum from the date of this judgment to the date of full and final payment.\n\nMachaya will also pay Dhudhlas costs of suit.\n\n",
