            "content": "The Mail and Guardian\n\nRwanda President Paul Kagame issued a stark warning to South Africa late on Wednesday night, accusing President Cyril Ramaphosa and his government of distorting facts about the ongoing conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and suggesting that Rwanda is prepared for confrontation if necessary.\n\nWhat has been said about [the conversations I had with Ramaphosa this week] in the media by South African officials and President Ramaphosa himself contains a lot of distortion, deliberate attacks, and even lies.\n\nIf words can change so much from a conversation to a public statement, it says a lot about how these very important issues are being managed, Kagame said in a post on his X account, in reply to Ramaphosas posted statement.\n\nRamaphosas statement followed the death of 13 South African soldiers deployed as part of the Southern African Development Community Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (SAMIDRC).\n\nThe death of the South African soldiers has intensified political and military scrutiny in Pretoria, forcing the government to justify its intervention in the decades-long conflict while navigating increasingly strained ties with Rwanda.\n\nSouth African officials have blamed the escalating violence on the M23 rebel group and the Rwandan Defence Force.\n\nInternational relations minister Ronald Lamola has said that South Africa is engaging with the African Union Peace and Security Council and the United Nations Security Council to push for an immediate ceasefire.\n\nIn his post, Kagame dismissed South Africas involvement in the peacekeeping, saying that SAMIDRC was not a peacekeeping mission but a belligerent force supporting the Congolese government.\n\nHe accused SAMIDRC of working alongside the Forces Dmocratiques de Libration du Rwanda (FDLR), a militia with historical ties to perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.\n\nFDLR targeted Rwanda, Kagame said, while also threatening to take the war to Rwanda itself.\n\nHe accused SAMIDRC of replacing the East African Community Regional Force, which he characterised as the only legitimate peacekeeping operation in the region.\n\nPresident Ramaphosa has never given a warning of any kind, unless it was delivered in his local language which I do not understand, Kagame said in his statement, addressing the notion that he had been cautioned by his South African counterpart.\n\nHe claimed instead that Ramaphosa had requested logistical assistance to ensure that South African troops had electricity, food, and water, which Rwanda would help facilitate.\n\nKagame said Ramaphosa had personally acknowledged that M23 was not responsible for the deaths of South African soldiers, but rather the Armed Forces of the DRC (FARDC).\n\nIf South Africa wants to contribute to peaceful solutions, that is well and good, but South Africa is in no position to take on the role of a peacemaker or mediator. And if South Africa prefers confrontation, Rwanda will deal with the matter in that context any day.\n\nEarlier, Ramaphosa had said that the fighting was the result of an escalation by the rebel group M23 and Rwanda Defence Force militia engaging the Armed Forces of the DRC and attacking peacekeepers from the SADC Mission.\n\nHe described the security situation as tense, volatile, and unpredictable.\n\nHe said that full support was being provided to those injured in the fighting, as well as to the families of the slain South African soldiers.\n\nRamaphosa said that South Africas military presence in the DRC was part of a regional and international peacekeeping effort.\n\nSouth Africas military presence in the eastern DRC is not a declaration of war against any country or state, he said. The SAMIDRC was there to protect civilians and uphold stability in the war-torn region.\n\nHe called on all parties to honour peace agreements, including the Luanda Process, and to respect the DRCs territorial integrity. He also welcomed the recent United Nations Security Council resolution urging an end to hostilities and the withdrawal of foreign forces from Congolese territory.\n\n",

If the fine is not paid, she must serve another six months each for the two charges.\n\nD Pramila, the Intelligence Officer of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in Kochi, investigated the case.\n\nChigwaza said she was just a carrier who agreed to bring in the drugs to raise money for her treatment in Delhi.\n\nThe court, however, did not go into the reasons for the crime, said Special Public Prosecutor for the NCB Adv Sunil J. Five grams of heroin is a small quantity, and 250 gm is a commercial quantity. Chigwaza was caught with nearly 12 times the commercial quantity, said Adv Sunil.\n\nThe minimum punishment for carrying and smuggling commercial quantities of heroin is 10 years each, and the maximum punishment is 20 years each. The court factored in her poor background and the fact that she was a woman and sentenced her to 11 years for each offence, he said. The sentences will run concurrently, so she will serve only 11 years in prison, he said.\n\nAccording to her statement to investigators, Chigwaza had been living as a refugee in South Africa with her parents and two sisters. However, NCB officials said her refugee certificate was fake.\n\nOn June 19, 2021, she landed at Kochi airport from Johannesburg via Doha on a Qatar Airways flight. As she prepared to board an onward IndiGo flight to Delhi, airport security grew suspicious and detained her. They found 2,910 gm of heroin in a secret pocket in her trolley bag. She was arrested, and the case was handed over to NCB.\n\nChigwaza told the officials that she had suffered multiple miscarriages and wanted money for treatment in Delhi. She said her Nigerian friend Ifeanyi offered her $2,000 (around Rs 1.47 lakh in June 2021) if she delivered the contraband at a Delhi lodge.\n\nHe reportedly told her that his brother would pick up the package and give her the money.\n\nShe took up the offer. It was her first trip to India. Special Public Prosecutor Adv Sunil said the courts sentencing clearly communicated that irrespective of nationality or circumstances, peddling drugs is a crime against the nation and will be punished. The court also said that the three years and seven months she spent in prison before her conviction would be deducted from her sentence.\n\n",

In a now deleted post, she shared a video of someone firing an automatic rifle at a poster of President Cyril Ramaphosa.\n\nIn 2022, a spokesperson from the elite police unit, Hawks, Brig Thandi Mbambo told local media they were not directly investigating her, but she had been named in statements from sources.\n\nIn response to this, Zuma-Sambudlasaid on X, I have no fear! I will not be intimidated! I have beaten the dogs, now the masters are coming out! We see you!\n\nAt the same time,the Jacob Zuma Foundation, said in a statement the former presidents children were being targeted.\n\nLast year, the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) released a report that said the riots were a carefully orchestrated event.\n\nBut it said it could find no direct link to Zumas arrest.\n\nIn 2023, a former security guard was sentenced to 12 years in prison for his role in the deadly riots.\n\nHe was the first person to be prosecuted for the riots.\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa, who succeeded Jacob Zuma in 2018, described the violence as an attempted insurrection.\n\nMore than 200 shopping malls were looted and more than 150,000 jobs were estimated to have been lost during the unrest, which lasted for several days.\n\nLast year, Zumas MK ran against his former party, the ANC, in elections, gaining 15% of the vote to become the countrys third largest party.\n\n",

To do this we will continue working with government, business and other stakeholders to push the acceptance and preference of local goods to create jobs, wealth and pride, further reads the statement.\n\nBuy Zimbabwe was established 13 years ago as a prime driver for the preference of locally produced quality goods and services.\n\nIts mission from the onset was to be a key player in the promotion of jobs, wealth and pride.\n\nWe are pleased that over the years the Buy Zimbabwe insignia has gained widespread acceptance and use by many companies and products.\n\nWe have also seen an increase in shelf space occupied by local products from 10% to over 50% for most local products.\n\nEqually, Zimbabwe has experienced the emergence of a number of new products on the market, especially from young entrepreneurs, women and the small to medium enterprises sector.\n\nThese inventors need to be supported to promote access to markets and economic growth. This is the direction that Buy Zimbabwe is now taking, Buy Zimbabwe said.\n\n",

It is the court that decided that the government must provide the rescue services to get these miners out of the shafts. For Zimbabwe we have no role to play this is purely a matter that is within the sovereign government of South Africa to manage, said the source.\n\nThe disaster sparked widespread criticism of the South African government, with accusations of human rights violations.\n\nMinister of Mines Gwede Mantashe shrugged off criticism saying the government can not be held responsible for the illegal miners deaths.\n\nHarare has remained silent on the issue although most of the miners were Zimbabwean nationals.\n\nThe Zimbabwean Embassy has not been informed on the causes of death of its nationals.\n\nThat I think it is something the police If indeed they do any autopsy if it is even possible to do that, I do not know the state of the bodies or whether they were in such a state to enable them to do an autopsy but we do not have that information, said the source.\n\n",
