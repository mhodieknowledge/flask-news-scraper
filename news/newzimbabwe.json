            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) has denied allegations of cruelty towards two lions housed at Chinhoyi Caves in Mashonaland West province.\n\nVisitors to the Ramsar world heritage site at Chinhoyi Caves have raised concern online over the unfavorable conditions the two lions one named Dingani, a 13-year-old male, and Laila, a 6-year-old female are being kept. They say the enclosure is too tiny while at times the stressed animals go without food and water.In response to the growing online concerns of poor animal welfare, ZimParks said plans are afoot to engage relevant teams and partners to address the issues raised.ZimParks acting spokesperson Tamiriraishe Mudzingwa said the two lions are receiving sufficient care and treatment despite being kept in separate enclosures.ZimParks remains committed to maintaining the highest standards of hospitality, safety, and conservation, the authority said.At present, there are two lions at Chinhoyi Caves: Dingani, a 13-year-old male, and Laila, a 6-year-old female.The two lions are currently housed separately, a decision made purely for their safety and wellbeing. This arrangement follows the males aggressive behaviour toward the female, and our teams are managing a gradual and carefully supervised reintroduction process, said Mudzingwa.The statement follows a plethora of social media posts alleging that two lions housed at Chinhoyi Caves are malnourished, poorly fed, and sometimes go without water. Critics also claimed the enclosures were too small, with some commentators describing the conditions particularly for the female lion as animal cruelty.ZimParks assured the public that its teams are monitoring the animals closely and that ongoing improvements are being made to address public concerns.\n\nVisitors to the Ramsar world heritage site at Chinhoyi Caves have raised concern online over the unfavorable conditions the two lions one named Dingani, a 13-year-old male, and Laila, a 6-year-old female are being kept.

They also support the tourism sector and boost trade and business activity, creating jobs and generating higher GDP she added.\n\nThe event was widely attended, with officials from countries such as Nigeria and Qatar leading their respective delegations.\n\nThe next edition of the event (ICAN 2026) is scheduled to be held in Equatorial Guinea.\n\n",

What is going on? Can I have an explanation from the Whips? Mudenda asked.\n\nZanu PF Chief Whip Pupurai Togarepi informed the Speaker that three committees were away.\n\nAs per your directive in this House, there should not be more than two Committees at a moment a week, but sometimes they just go without even advising the Whips. I am supposed to concur with those who arrange these outreaches. When I came in, I realised there were a few members only to be told that these committees would have gone out without my knowledge. We need to sit down with the administration to ensure that we protect attendance.\n\nResponding, Mudenda emphasised that parliamentary attendance must take precedence.\n\nWhile the public hearings are critical, and I do not know why they should arise after we have had public hearings on the Pre-Budget. There is no excuse why these committees should be out. Absolutely no excuse. The priority is for members to be here in the House as representatives of the people. You are the voice of the people who are not able to be in this august House.\n\nNow, if you are not there, how is their voice going to be heard? So, this must stop forthwith from next week. No committees should go out unless absolutely necessary.\n\nIn recent weeks, MPs have been making what observers describe as outrageous demands, claiming that their allowances are insufficient to meet their personal needs.
