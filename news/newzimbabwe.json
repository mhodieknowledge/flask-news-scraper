Thats a good reason to tow away that car and the driver to pay a heavy fine.\n\nWe hope further investigations will be conducted and bring the officers on that roadblock to book for allowing such a car to pass, said Mapiya.\n\nJerry Maguranyanga said for years he took pride in ZRP as a top policing organisation in Africa but the level of corruption is becoming more apparent.\n\nCarlos Mufiri concurred with Mapuranga, noting the graft was increasingly contributing to road carnage.\n\nZRP is very toxic. All the police officers at roadblocks along the above-mentioned road knew about the 13 passengers in the car but the driver just paid his way, said Mufiri.\n\nThirteen passengers, you are not working you guys. What are the reasons for your roadblocks?\n\nStakeholders interviewed by NewZimbabwe.com in Mashonaland West province called on government to ban pirate taxis plying various routes and introduce regulated conventional buses.\n\nThere are pirates that ply the Chinhoyi-Chegutu route while others transit between the provincial capital and Harare, Karoi, Mhangura and other outlying areas such as Kenzamba, Makonde district.\n\nWHAT HAS GIVEN RISE TO PIRATE TAXIS\n\nSince September last year, 13,886 motorists have been arrested nationwide for operating pirate taxis, an indicator of how rampant pirates are in Zimbabwe.\n\nUnregistered taxis have been part of Zimbabwes transportation system for years, but they have increased since the coronavirus pandemic as other legal means of transport fell away, according to the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development.\n\nIn 2020, to enforce lockdown measures and discourage people from leaving their homes, the government outlawed the countrys most dependable means of transport: licensed and privately owned omnibuses, minivan taxis  locally known as kombis  and smaller cabs. Only public buses, which are few and unreliable, were allowed to operate.\n\nThe ban was lifted in December 2022 but several private operators that had disposed of their vehicles struggled to get back into business. As a result, pirate taxis still dominate the public transportation sector.\n\nDespite various public awareness campaigns to educate passengers on the dangers of using illegal taxis, illegal taxis continue to thrive.\n\nThe demographic and geographical growth of Zimbabwean cities has put pressure on public transportation services, according to research from the Harare-based nonprofit Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development (ZIMCODD).\n\nZimbabwes population has increased by 16.2% and now stands at 15.1 million people, up from the 13 million in the 2012 census.\n\nWhen there is population growth, our cities then also expand, says Cynthia Huni, an urban planning expert.\n\nYou see new suburbs being opened, and when that happens you have to create new roads and transport systems.\n\nWhile the lack of reliable public transport has created new opportunities for an informal market, Passenger Association of Zimbabwe (PAZ) president, Tafadzwa Goliati believes the influx of pirate taxis also stems from the countrys economic hardships characterised by high unemployment.\n\nThere is general poverty and joblessness in this country and people are not earning much to survive, so they find alternatives to make ends meet  and pirate taxis is one of those means, Goliati says.\n\nADVOCACY FOR JAILING OF MUSHIKASHIKA DRIVERS, OPERATORS\n\nJust like commuter omnibuses were outlawed for causing road traffic accidents, some stakeholders are also calling on the government to deal harshly with mushikashika and jail those who operate them.\n\nLast September, government implemented the radius-based restrictions for commuter omnibuses from 120 km to 60 km, a move aimed at improving road safety on the countrys major roads.This applied to commuter omnibuses with a seating capacity of 26 passengers and below.\n\nTransport and Infrastructural Development Minister Felix Mhona said the move was aimed at mitigating against road traffic accidents involving kombis.\n\nThe minister argued that high-capacity buses had greater leg space and baggage space for long-distance travellers than kombis, which makes buses more ideal for long-distance journeys.\n\nA member of Women Coalition of Zimbabwe (WiCOZ), Mary-Anne Mutsambi said besides being sexually violated in crammed pirate taxis, the speeding vessels put the lives of breadwinners at high risk of leaving their children orphaned.\n\nI am personally advocating for a total ban on mushikashika and incarceration of drivers and owners. Pirate taxis have become death traps, and we are needlessly losing lives and limbs daily.\n\nThe pirates are notorious for overloading passengers like sardines, speeding, hailing insults and profanities as well as flouting road rules and regulations with abandon recklessness at the expense of passengers lives and wellbeing, therefore imprisonment of drivers and operators is the only way to make our roads safer and saner, said Mutsambi.\n\n",

From time-to-time we were now sending food, medication and lotions but it was not enough, cancer kept growing.\n\nThe current drought made things worse for them, that even in her state she would try to go for piece jobs until around June 2024 when she was now bedridden.\n\nShe endured extreme pain during her last days. Because she didnt get sunscreen, early screening and treatment we lost her, an emotional Tshuma said.\n\nThe activist also bemoaned neglect from the government and called for the establishment of regular skin cancer screenings, at least twice a year.\n\nShe is also lobbying for hospitals and clinics to have at least one staffer professionally trained in albinism-related health issues.\n\nl am traumatised because of what l see in the countryside, brothers and sisters dying without treatment. The fundraisers we do are only a drop in the ocean.\n\nThe Government of Zimbabwe has abdicated its duty especially to my community of persons with albinism.\n\nWe need regular skin screening at least two times a year. Hospitals and clinics must have at least one health professional knowledgeable about albinism and skin cancer for early referrals, she added.\n\nChigovas passing shows the harsh reality for many in rural Zimbabwe, where treatable and preventable illnesses often lead to death because of neglect.\n\n",

            "content": "By Noel T Ngangira\n\nPut aside the recent political turmoil, Mozambique set in motion an energy juggernaut plan that left many African nations drooling in awe.\n\nLets rewind a bit. In 2023, energy exports from coal, gas, and electricity topped US$5.8 billion. Coal led the pack with $3.4 billion, followed by gas at $1.73 billion and electricity ($658 million). 80% of its electricity exports went to SA and 15.4% to Zimbabwe.\n\nWith 180 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves mainly in the Rovuma Basin off the coast of Cabo Delgado, Mozambique is only bettered by Nigeria (with 203 trillion cubic feet) in Africa. It ranks 14th in the world. Energy giants TotalEnergies (France), Exxon Mobil (USA), Eni (Italy) and CNPC (China) are the key LNG operators in Mozambique.\n\nCahora Bassa Hydro power station in Tete province has a power generation capacity of 2,075MW, and plans are underway to increase it to 4,000MW. The following hydroelectric power plants are also in the pipeline and will be online between 2027 and 2031: Mphanda Nkuwa, 1,500MW (Tete); Chemba, 1,000 MW (Sofala); Lupata, 650MW (Tete); and Boroma, 210MW (Tete). This is hydropower only; there is solar and thermal to boot.\n\nFor comparison, Zimbabwe generates about 1,500MW but has an installed capacity of about 2,240MW (hydro and thermal). According to the 2022 Population and Housing Census, 62% of Zimbabwes population has access to electricity  though its not mentioned how many hours per day was/is the electricity actually available.\n\nAccording to the International Trade Administration (ITA), Mozambique aims to achieve universal electrification by 2030. Significant strides to achieve this goal have been made. It moved from 34% in 2021 to 48% in 2022 in terms of population with access to electricity. With the investments made and the work in progress, energy for all is within reach for sure.\n\nThe Mozambican government plans an additional 14,000MW of green energy (hydro) between 2030 and 2040. In its energy transition strategy document, the government plans a whooping US$80 billion investment in the energy sector by 2050. Serious stuff!\n\nITA adds that Mozambique has the largest power generation potential of all Southern African countries. Power Africa estimates that the nation could generate 187 gigawatts (187,000MW) of power from coal, hydro, gas, wind, and solar.\n\nSources include Global Data, Club Mozambique, International Trade Administration (ITA), Power Africa, ADB COP28, and UNICEF.\n\nNoel T Ngangira writes in his personal capacity.
