Since his arrival, he has featured in every match his new team has played.\n\nHis latest outing came over the weekend when he helped Marinhense advance to the second round of the Taa de Portugal knockout tournament.\n\nIts always difficult to adapt to a new environment, but Im happy with how Im settling in here. My teammates and coaches have welcomed me warmly, Chimedza said.\n\nIve played at least four competitive games so far, and in our last cup match, I was pleased to contribute to the teams progress to the next stage.\n\nChimedza signed for Gil Vicente earlier this year but was unable to feature due to delays in the clearance of his international papers. As a result, he was loaned out to gain game time and experience.\n\nThe former MK Dons player hopes his spell at Marinhense will prepare him for a return to his parent club.\n\nMy focus is on working hard and contributing to Marinhenses success. At the end of the season, my target is to return to Gil Vicente and cement my place in the team, he added.\n\nBorn in Harare, Chimedza moved to England at the age of 14 after being scouted by English League Two side MK Dons, where he developed before moving to Portugal this year.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nHUMAN rights defenders have criticised the recent bombing of opposition leader Job Sikhalas Chitungwiza home, amid fears of a renewed wave of raids on properties linked to exiled Zimbabweans.\n\nThe alleged bombing of Sikhalas house while he was away in South Africa raises the spectre of a fresh campaign of political persecution, says human rights activist Munacho Humbasha.\n\nHe says the attack on Sikhalas house is a chilling message to critics of Zanu PF, both at home and abroad.\n\nSikhala, a former legislator and long-time government critic, has been frequenting South Africa for medical and political engagements.\n\nHumbasha told NewZimbabwe.com that Zanu PF functionaries and State security agents have openly declared war on activists in the diaspora, with families back home being deliberately targeted.\n\nThose with houses visited in the widening campaign and searches include that of Petty Ziramba, Panganayi Mauzinyu, Ralph Dube, Fransisca Chiduku, and Shepherd Yuda, said Humbasha.\n\nIn Mabvuku, unknown men believed to be State agents raided the home of the late opposition activist Tonderai Ndira. The assailants took household property and left the house empty, promising to return and destroy their livelihoods. The family is still in shock.\n\nIn Harare, suspected operatives broke into Blessing Makeyis house and again into his family home, allegedly searching for incriminating material. Makevi has been active in diaspora protests against President Emmerson Mnangagwas government, Humbasha told NewZimbabwe.com in an interview.\n\nAlso, another dissenter, Ralph Dubes family, is living in uncertainty after receiving threatening messages, says Humbasha.\n\nBack home, he further claimed, several homes in Seke, Chitungwiza, having been visited by suspicious individuals in recent days, thereby sparking fears in the community.\n\nDespite repeated reports of break-ins and intimidation, police have not arrested anyone in connection with the incidents. Efforts to get a comment from police national spokesman, Commissioner Paul Nyathi, were fruitless by the time of publishing.\n\nVictims and their families say the inaction points to the States complicity.\n\nThis is meant to punish those of us who are in the UK and elsewhere. Our families are being harassed everyday because we speak out, said UK-based activist, Melody Magejo, who spoke to NewZimbabwe.com in a telephone interview.\n\nA human rights lawyer, who preferred anonymity, said as Mnangagwa gravitates towards entrenching his rule through his 2030 agenda, the political environment is set to worsen.\n\nThe use of Patriotic Act and Cyber Security Act 2023 will lead to many arrests of those who are actively participating in campaigns on social media.\n\nIt is without a doubt that Mnangagwas government does not want the outside world to know what is happening in the country, said the lawyer.\n\n",

            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo | IOL\n\nThe Democratic Alliance (DA) has strongly criticised President Cyril Ramaphosas remarks praising Zimbabwes land reform programme during his visit to Harare last week.\n\nRamaphosa was in Zimbabwe at the invitation of President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa, where he attended the annual Zimbabwe Agricultural Show as guest of honour. Speaking at the event, Ramaphosa congratulated Zimbabwe for reviving its agricultural sector through policy reforms, investment in irrigation, mechanisation, and empowering both large- and small-scale farmers.\n\nOn independence in 1980, the new democratic government of Zimbabwe had to take on the momentous task of dismantling colonial-era patterns of land ownership. Most of the countrys commercially productive land and large-scale farms were owned by whites. The black majority was confined to communal lands and excluded from commercial farming, said Ramaphosa.\n\nIt was therefore essential  for both historical redress and food security, development and economic growth  that the government embarked on ambitious reforms to facilitate the entry of black Zimbabweans into productive agriculture, including support to small-scale farmers.\n\nReacting to Ramaphosas remarks, DA national spokesperson and Member of Parliament Willie Aucamp said the president was wrongfully praising a programme that devastated Zimbabwes economy.\n\nThe DA condemns and rejects this praise by Ramaphosa for a process which left Zimbabwe in tatters, destroying its economy, destroying its foreign relations, and creating famine for its people, Aucamp said.\n\nHe argued that because land was not legally transferred, Zimbabwe was left with crippling financial reparations due to former farmers and landowners.\n\nRamaphosa is attempting to whitewash the disaster in Zimbabwe, to create momentum for the ANCs land expropriation agenda in terms of the Expropriation Act of 2025, Aucamp added.\n\nWhile acknowledging the need for land reform in South Africa, the DA insisted it must be pursued within the bounds of the Constitution and rule of law.\n\nThe DA firmly believes in the need to redress the injustices of the past, particularly through fair and lawful land reform that restores dignity and economic opportunity. However, this redress must occur within the bounds of the Constitution and the rule of law, which Expropriation Without Compensation does not meet, Aucamp said.\n\nHe further stressed that the Government of National Unity does not endorse Zimbabwes land confiscation model.\n\n",
