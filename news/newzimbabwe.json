Currently, they earn US$230.In a statement Friday, ZINASU demanded the postponement of all exams, provision of academic support, and a public commitment by the university to negotiate in good faith with striking lecturers.We demand that these conditions be met and publicly communicated to the student body no later than Saturday 10 May, at 23:59 hours. Failure to comply with these reasonable demands will leave us with no alternative but to initiate a total shutdown of the university beginning Monday 12 May, 08:00AM.This action will continue indefinitely until our demands are met in full. We warn the administration that any attempt to intimidate, victimize, or discipline students for exercising their right to peacefully protest will be met with fierce resistance. We will not be silenced or deterred, the letter reads.Meanwhile, a rival students body, the Zimbabwe Congress of Students Union (ZICOSU) also acknowledged the negative impact of ongoing lecturers strike and said it is engaging the administration to allow prepared students to sit for exams, while supporting postponements for those whose studies have been disrupted.As ZICOSU we recognise the challenges posed by recent disruptions. We have actively engaged with the administration to ensure that students attending lectures and fulfilling coursework requirements can proceed with their exams.We understand that those affected by the strike may require postponements, as exams cannot be undertaken without completed coursework, reads a statement from ZICOSU.Over a week ago, President Emmerson Mnangagwas spokesperson, George Charamba assured the lecturers that government would address their grievances, but the Association of University Teachers (AUT) says there has been no engagement from the UZ authorities or parent ministry.\n\nThe learners have threatened a total shutdown of the institution starting May 12 if their demands are not met.\n\nUZ lecturers announced a job action last month and have staged demonstrations at the learning institution over paltry salaries and poor working conditions.\n\nThe lecturers are demanding a return to their pre-2018 salaries when a junior lecturer earned US$2,250.

Production has already started in earnest with pig iron and steel billets now available.\n\nThe Ministry of Industry gave us a figure that last year and the past few years we had spent so many US dollars to import steel which I think has a very significant impact on import substitution, said Tanaka.\n\nWe are producing quality steel locally. Steel is now available here, do not import. There is no need to import that which is produced locally.\n\nWhat we are producing is proper steel, not recycled stuff from Mbare. It can sustain any mega project or high-rise building.\n\nDISCO, which sits on the site of a proposed smart city in Mvuma, also owns DINSON Colliery in Hwange and a ferrochrome plant in Selous, Afrochine Smelting.\n\nDuring the media tour, Tanaka indicated his willingness to work with small-to-medium chrome miners and suppliers whom he said were key to their operations.\n\nThe miners were represented by officials from Masvingo, Mashonaland East, Mashonaland West, Midlands and Harare provinces of the Zimbabwe Miners Federation (ZMF).\n\nThe Manhize plant has already reached 90% capitalisation and expects to produce five million tonnes at its final stage.\n\n",

Out of these, only 23 have been brought under control. The majority of outbreaks have been reported in provinces with high levels of artisanal mining and agricultural activities.Mashonaland Central, Manicaland, and Mashonaland West are the most affected provinces, contributing a combined 82.8% of all cases and 72.9% of all deaths. Children under the age of five account for 14% of the total malaria cases, reads the statement.The ministry has put in place several measures to combat the malaria outbreak, including the free distribution of essential malaria prevention tools such as Insecticide Treated Nets (ITNs), larvicides, diagnostic kits, and treatment medications.The Ministry of Health and Child Care has taken a number of steps to address the outbreakprovincial and district health teams have intensified community mobilisation and awareness campaigns to encourage early treatment and the use of mosquito prevention methods.A total of 1,615,000 ITNs are being distributed in 14 high-risk districts, although there is a shortfall of 600,000 nets due to the withdrawal of funding from the United States government.The government remains committed to closing this gap through increased domestic financing. Larvicides are being applied to breeding sites where available, although supply remains limited, the statement further noted.The ministry also indicated that there are enough stocks of medicines and diagnostics kits for malaria, urging the public to get tested when they experience unusual fever conditions within 24 hours.The country currently has adequate stocks of malaria medicines and diagnostic kits. These were prepositioned ahead of the peak transmission period through NatPharm in collaboration with Provincial Medical Directors.All suspected malaria cases are tested and, if positive, treated appropriately. Efforts are also ongoing to work with the Ministry of Mines and Mining Development to better reach artisanal mining populations, who are highly mobile and often difficult to access.Despite these efforts, challenges remain. Climate change continues to expand the mosquito breeding season and increase the vector population. Artisanal mining activities are increasing. and with them, the number of breeding sites and the population exposed during peak mosquito biting hours. Many of these communities remain difficult to reach and are hesitant to engage with health authorities.The Ministry reminds the public that this is the high malaria transmission period.

Some may be caused by distance to school and schools are being built to adhere to five kilometres for a child to walk to school and some, it is just clear motivation from parents that needed, said Gata\n\nAs the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education, we have embarked on a programme that is called Early Warning System. This programme will help us with indications on what are the causes of school drop-outs in both primary and secondary school.\n\nSo, we are training our teachers who are helping us to identify communities that will need help. We are doing this partnering with UNICEF and it has been going on so far for six months. It has started already in schools and as we speak, they are on the ground training our staff.\n\nThere are various reasons for school dropouts. Depending on the reasons, some of the reasons could be girls getting pregnant and school fees, which is being catered for by BEAM.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nYEARS after promising theresuscitation of ZISCO Steel, the government is struggling to proffer a once-off solution to bring back the firm to its hey days.\n\nZISCO Steel was once a major steel producer in Zimbabwe, but it faced financial difficulties, mismanagement, and a lack of investment, leading to its closure in 2008.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament recently, Industry and Commerce Minister, Mangaliso Ndlovu struggled to point outany tangible progress made to revive the entity, tabling sketchy plans.\n\nNdlovu was being quizzed by Mbizo legislator, Corban Madziwanyika.\n\nThe coming on board of Dinson Iron and Steel Company currently presents a unique opportunity to build synergies with the existing ZISCO Company plant and other downstream industries such as Lancashire, hence promoting the revival of the local iron and steel sector, said Ndlovu.\n\nHe said currently, there are three key initiatives being undertaken by the government in resuscitating ZISCO and supporting Lancashire Steel. The first one, he said, is the reviving of the wire mill plant at Lancashire Steel whichwill see the manufacturing of wire rods, drawn wire, weld wire and brick force, barbed wire as well as galvanised wire.\n\nThe Industry Minister said the initiative is expected to create more than 20 jobs and provide wire-related products to both up and downstream industries and generate revenue for the company.\n\nThe second one is the establishment of a limestone beneficiation plant at BIMCO. The plant will manufacture burnt lime, aggregate stones for construction and mill limestone into different products. As the House might be aware, we had Kuvimba which had a management contract that has since been terminated owing to non-performance by the contractor.\n\nThis therefore means that the ZISCO board and management have regained urgency to manage and control its own affairs and we welcome this development at this critical juncture, he said.\n\nNdlovu said the government is now closer to inking an MOU that ensures that companies in the steel sector do not compete in producing the same products but rather, complement each other.\n\nDinson produces pig iron and steel billets for exports and will soon be producing the second stage of hot rolled wires and rolling bars. They have agreed in principle to leave certain types to be produced by ZISCO Steel and these are the shafts, the wire, the beams, the angles and the flat sections.\n\nThe entire sector will leverage the emergence of Dinson Company, which has started production of pig irons and steel billets. I want to submit by concluding that for their part, ZISCO Steel is currently mobilising resources to revive one of their kins for limestone beneficiation into burnt lime or what we call quick lime, which is used to remove impurities in steel making and is also used in construction such as cement manufacturing, added Ndlovu.\n\n",
