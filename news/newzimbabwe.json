            "content": "BBC\n\nNigerian Nobel laureate Wole Soyinka has said the US revoked his visa and banned him from the country.\n\nThe 91-year-old author, who won the Nobel Prize for literature in 1986, said the US consulate asked him to bring in his passport so his visa could be cancelled in person as new unspecified information had come to light.\n\nSoyinka called the invitation a rather curious love letter from an embassy in a news conference held on Tuesday and told organisations hoping to invite him to the US not to waste their time.\n\nThe US embassy in Nigeria has said it cannot comment on individual cases.\n\nThe Nobel laureate has previously held permanent residency in the US but renounced it in 2016, tearing up his green card in protest of President Donald Trumps election.\n\nThe green card is a permanent residence permit for the US  prized by many African immigrants to the US.\n\nSoyinka affirmed on Tuesday that he no longer had his green card  and jokingly added that it had fallen between the fingers of a pair of scissors and it got cut into a couple of pieces.\n\nThe famed author has had regular teaching engagements at US universities for the past 30 years.\n\nI have no visa. I am banned, he said on Tuesday.\n\nSoyinka has long been critical of the Trump administrations radical stance on immigration and linked the visa revocation to his outspoken criticism.\n\nHe said his recent comparison of Trump to Ugandas dictator  Idi Amin in white face  may have contributed to the current situation.\n\nWhen I called Donald Trump Idi Amin, I thought I was paying him a compliment, Soyinka said, hes been behaving like a dictator.\n\nIdi Amin was a Ugandan military officer and dictator who ruled the country from 1971 to 1979, infamous for his brutal regime and widespread human rights abuses.\n\nWhen asked if he would consider going back to the US, Soyinka said: How old am I?\n\nIn July, the US State Department announced sweeping changes to its non-immigrant visa policy for citizens of Nigeria and several other African countries.\n\nAccording to the policy, nearly all non-immigrant and non-diplomatic visas issued to Nigerians and nationals of Cameroon, Ethiopia and Ghana would now be single-entry and valid for only three months, rolling back the up to five-year, multiple-entry visas they had enjoyed previously.\n\n",

The first incident took place during Finance Minister Mthuli Ncubes 2025 National Budget Presentation in November last year, which the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) attributed to natural causes.\n\nDespite prior arrangements to ensure backup power, the latest blackout still occurred, prompting Speaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda to hint at possible sabotage.\n\nMudenda warned that the culprit will regret the day of their existence.\n\nNow in damage control mode, Clerk of Parliament Kennedy Chokuda released a statement explainingthe technical cause of the outage.\n\nThe loss of power supply to key systems occurred when the Parliament Building was running on a generator as the main source of supply, with ZESA power as a standby. When supplies were lost, the generator was still running but not supplying power.\n\nPreliminary investigations indicate that a circuit breaker supplying the load had tripped. The restoration took longer than expected, resulting in part of the SONA being delivered without power, Chokuda said.\n\nParliament said it is working with the Ministry of Local Government, ZESA, and other relevant government agencies to investigate the incident. The findings will be made public once investigations are complete, and measures will be put in place to prevent a recurrence.\n\n",

My Government is committed to weeding out irresponsible mining stakeholders who cause pollution, environmental degradation, and damage to critical infrastructure.\n\nAs we welcome investors into our jurisdiction, we expect them to adhere to the Constitution and laws of our country, while also respecting our people, customs, and culture, he said.\n\nHowever, citizens have urged the government to make the Mines and Minerals Bill available in vernacular languages to ensure easier understanding and interpretation, especially within mining communities.\n\n",
