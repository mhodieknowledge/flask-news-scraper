            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Labour Court has overturned the dismissal of former Immigration Department officer Herbert Admire Makani, ruling that the Civil Service Commission (CSC) bungled the disciplinary process and misdirected itself in law.\n\nMakani was fired in August 2021 after being found guilty of sexually harassing a former colleague, Fortune Nyamuremba, through alleged calls and text messages between 2011 and 2014, as well as for alleged indecorous conduct.\n\nBut Justice Bridget Chivizhe, in a judgment delivered recently said the CSCs case was riddled with procedural flaws and a lack of evidence.\n\nThe Disciplinary Committee merely pronounced the appellant guilty and recited the alleged facts, Justice Chivizhe said.\n\nIt failed to clearly link those facts to the specific charges or to distinguish which conduct constituted a contravention of paragraph 4 and which fell under paragraph 7 of the Public Service Regulations, 2000.\n\nThe court found that the Commission misrepresented Makanis testimony by claiming he had not denied contacting Nyamuremba,a statement contradicted by the official record.\n\nAt page 6 of the minutes the appellant categorically denied the allegations.\n\nFurther when specifically asked whether he had ever called Ms Nyamuremba, the appellant responded unequivocally that he had never phoned her, the court noted.\n\nChivizhe also ruled that the CSC failed to provide key evidence, such as the alleged messages or phone numbers involved.\n\nIn the absence of such evidence, the Disciplinary Authority could not reasonably or lawfully conclude that the elements of the offence were satisfied, she said.\n\nA finding of guilt in such circumstances is unsupported by the evidentiary record and cannot stand.\n\nThe judge stressed that the CSC wrongly shifted the burden of proof onto Makani.\n\nIt is a cardinal principle of the law of procedure that he who alleges must prove Where he fails to prove, his case will not stick, Justice Chivizhe wrote.\n\nThe onus was on the respondent to establish the appellants guilt. The appellant did not carry the burden of proof.\n\nCiting theKazingiingizi v Dzinorumaprecedent, the court warned that decisions without clear reasoning are susceptible to being perceived as arbitrary or capricious.\n\nThe court allowed the appeal with costs and ordered that Makani be reinstated without loss of salary or benefits from the date of dismissal. If reinstatement is impossible, the CSC must pay damages to be agreed upon within 30 days.\n\n",
