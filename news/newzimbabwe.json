If successful, this will mark his rise in the political sphere and possibly to the presidency.\n\nAdded Mutsvangwa, What will be wrong is to say we are getting into the party so that I can become that and that post, that I can become the president because that is not the purpose of joining the party, the purpose of joining the party is to follow the constitution of the party and see to it that when succession or when the succession is done by votes that you comply with the terms of that party.\n\nBut if you come on a ticket that I want power the people may see through what you want and that becomes a challenge, hopefully all the businessman entrance who will come, they come to say we want to serve the party not to serve themselves, because serving themselves will not take them anywhere in ZANU PF I can vouch for that, just like presidents who went haywire we removed them. ZANU PF will winnow out any people who may have hidden ambitions other than following the structures of the ZANU PF.\n\nWith Mnangagwa serving his final term in office, some sections of ZANU PF are pushing for an extension of his tenure, while others, backing his vice, Constantino Chiwenga, are pushing for him to step aside in 2028.\n\nMnangagwa has stressed that he is a constitutionalist and will leave after his final term, but has not publicly condemned those pushing for his stay.\n\n",

He says some of them have enabled antisemitism on campus and uphold discriminatory admissions policies.\n\nThe state department memo, viewed by the BBCs US partner CBS News, directed US embassies on Tuesday to remove any unfilled appointments from their calendars for students seeking visas, but said those with appointments already scheduled could go ahead.\n\nThe diplomatic cable also said the state department was preparing for an expansion of required social media screening and vetting applicable to all student visa applications.\n\nForeign students who want to study in the US are usually required to schedule interviews at an American embassy in their home country before approval.\n\nMany institutions rely on foreign students for a significant chunk of their funding, as they often pay higher tuition fees.\n\nWhen asked about student visas, state department spokesperson Tammy Bruce told reporters on Tuesday: We take very seriously the process of vetting who it is that comes into the country, and were going to continue to do that.\n\nThe Trump administration has frozen hundreds of millions of dollars in funding for universities and moved to deport students, while revoking thousands of visas for others. Many of these actions have been blocked by the courts.\n\nThe White House has accused some US universities of allowing pro-Palestinian activism on campus to be hijacked by antisemitism.\n\nColleges have accused the Trump administration of trying to infringe upon free speech rights.\n\nHarvard University has been the focal point of President Donald Trumps ire. Last week, the Trump administration revoked Harvards ability to enrol international students or host foreign researchers. A federal judge blocked the policy.\n\nIf the measure is allowed, it could deliver a devastating blow to the university, where more than a quarter of students are foreign.\n\n",

An ordinary lecturer is getting less than US$229 a month, which is far too little compared to what we used to receive before 2018. We cannot pay our bills, feed our families, or send our children to school, said Chirere.\n\nThe lecturers, under the Association of University Teachers (AUT), have been locked in a dispute with UZ, demanding that their grievances be addressed.\n\nHowever, the university has remained mum, threatening to abandon academic processes as lecturers remain resolute.\n\nChirere warned that if the situation remains unresolved, UZ risks cancelling graduation due to the ongoing impasse.\n\nWhat this means is, since we have been out for over a month, there will not be exams for the students because they have not been taught. It also means there may well be no graduation this year.\n\nThe exams for Block Two have not been processed. The teaching for Block Three has not taken place, and the teaching for Block Four has not taken place. The university is still at a standstill, said Chirere.\n\nLecturers are demanding salaries of US$2,500, which they argue are in line with other higher education institutions in Southern Africa.\n\nAn AUT spokesperson told NewZimbabwe.com that their situation is worsened by the lack of essential teaching tools, forcing them to use personal equipment.\n\nThe issues are quite numerous. At UZ, from time immemorial, this has been a huge challengeworse under the current vice-chancellor. We have now adopted Education 5.0, which requires a big chunk of online teaching and adapting to global trends.\n\nThey have not provided tools of the trade. For example, we do not have computers issued for work. There are no smartphones, and we do not have data.\n\nThe other issue is the working environment itself. UZ administration is dictatorial. There is no platform for engagement, said Obvious Vengeyi, the AUT spokesperson.\n\nIn response, UZ has taken a heavy-handed approach, suspending striking lecturers and reportedly recruiting replacement staff at US$3 per hour.\n\nAccording to AUT, the newly hired staff are insufficient to cater to the overwhelming number of students enrolled at the institution.\n\nChirere expressed concern over the continued silence from UZ leadership, led by Vice-Chancellor Paul Mapfumo.\n\nWhat worries us is that there seems to be no response from the responsible authorities within the University of Zimbabwe about our plight, said Chirere.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nSouth Africas Minister for Minerals and Petroleum Resources Gwede Mantashe said his country is initiating discussions with Zambia and Zimbabwe on the possibility of running the electricity transmission line from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) under the Grand Inga project, through which 2,500 megawatts are envisaged for the country.\n\nMantashe was responding to questions from members of the Portfolio Committee on Minerals and Petroleum Resources on Tuesday, who had asked about the status of the project and what the country was doing to harness regional collaboration following the decision to postpone participation in the project.\n\nThe Grand Inga project is not ours; its a DRC project, given to the Spanish and Chinese. We have a right to buy equity in it, which would have to be approved by the DRC. We have not bought that equity, so we cant really pretend to be managing the Inga project. It is not our project. We have committed ourselves to a quantity of electricity that will be taken up by South Africa, but the driving of the project is out of our jurisdiction, Mantashe said.\n\nMKP MP Crown Prince Adil Nchabaleng objected to the Ministers stance, indicating that South Africa still considered the project feasible.\n\nYou cant expect to tell us that you are going to power South Africa from the Grand Inga project. Is South Africa talking about a concession to resell in that market with regard to the 2 500 MW as an investment partnership? You cannot power South Africa from the Grand Inga project, he said.\n\nMantashe maintained that there were ongoing discussions.\n\nThe Grand Inga Hydropower Project, a massive dam construction on the Congo River in the DRC, is intended to generate a large amount of electricity, with South Africa being a key off-taker. This project is envisioned as a major source of clean energy for the region and potentially for the entire African continent.\n\nSouth Africa has expressed interest in importing electricity from the Grand Inga project, particularly from Inga 3, the first of the new hydropower facilities.\n\nSouth Africas energy planning assumes the country will import 2500 MW from Inga by 2030, with the potential to double this to 5 000 MW.\n\nA long transmission line, passing through Angola, Namibia, and Botswana, would be needed to deliver power from Inga to Gauteng, South Africas economic heartland.\n\nSouth Africa and the DRC have signed agreements on receiving electricity from Inga, and the project is in the process of finalizing an agreement and securing financing.\n\nMeanwhile, Mantashe clarified that the launch of the South African National Petroleum Corporation (SANPC), which resulted from the restructuring of the department into two entities, may seem like a negative intervention to many, but gave the department space and opportunity to prioritise petroleum appropriately. He noted that petroleum is a source of 80% of the worlds energy but currently plays second fiddle to renewables.\n\n",

The nation wrote to 10 nations to request bridge funds, Ncube said, adding that official bilateral bridge loans are governments preferred strategy to clear the arrears.\n\nThe southern African nation owes creditors $21 billion. The debt has precluded it from accessing global capital markets since it defaulted on payments in 1999.\n\nIt expects to finalise a staff-monitored program with the International Monetary Fund by the end of June, a key step to attract bridge financing sponsors. An IMF delegation is also scheduled to pay a visit to the country next month.\n\nThe European Investment Fund, which the country owes $390 million, made up of $150 million principal and the rest in interest, expects to be treated as preferred creditor, in the debt talks, said Roger Stuart, head of regional hub at EIB.\n\nThat is the totality of the arrears will be paid to EIB without any losses, he said. We will be part of a process whereby all the international financial institutions will agree.\n\nOutgoing AfDB President Akinwumi Adesina urged the Abidjan-based lender to consider using part of its African Development Fund to help Zimbabwe clear some of its arrears.\n\nI am ending my time as AfDB president but will not and will never end my support for Zimbabwe, he said.

The Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), once headed by Nelson Chamisa, was hijacked by self-styled secretary general Sengezo Tshabangu and has since been singing in favour of Mnangagwas term extension.\n\nChamisa withdrew from the party and announced a sabbatical.\n\nIt is actually an indication that we no longer have opposition politics in the country, that is why you find war veterans have stepped in to provide checks and balances.\n\n",
