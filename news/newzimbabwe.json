Her passion for floristry began when her youngest was just nine years old, and she later expanded her business into an estate agency.\n\nI went through the thick and thin of life\n\nHer life took her to Durban, Johannesburg, and back to Cape Town, where she lived out her later years near the beach, developing a close bond with her neighbour, Sylwa Malan.\n\nIn her later years, Tannie Cora moved to the then Huis Lckhoff, now known as Rosebank House, at the age of 81, where she enjoyed a rich community life filled with music, scripture studies, and visits from loved ones.\n\nNow, at 107 years old, Tannie Cora has become a living testament to resilience and a source of wisdom for those around her, imparting life lessons that include the importance of family unity, fairness, humor, and staying engaged with life.\n\nJames Wichary, the Manager of Rosebank House, recalled the first day he met Tannie Cora. She was one of the first people I met when I started here, Wichary shared.\n\nEveryone talked about Tannie Cora, and when I heard she was 106, I thought, That means she was born in 1918, absolutely astonishing! She lived through two world wars, two pandemics, and witnessed the world transform. She is like a living, breathing encyclopedia.\n\nWichary admires Tannie Coras vitality, noting, You can still have a conversation with her.\n\nThe energy is vibrant and engaging, and she knows whats going on around her. She enjoys family visits, soaking up the sun, and is quite funny.\n\nStaff member Allison Goodheart also fondly remembers when Tannie Cora was wheeled into the sunroom on her birthday, beaming with delight.\n\nShes still very aware of everything around her, Goodheart said.\n\nWhen we brought her cake, she looked at it and said, Beautiful!\n\nWhen asked how she feels at 107, Tannie Cora replied with a twinkle in her eye: Happy chappy! I still look 91, and then cracked a little smirk, adding a playful touch to the conversation.\n\nHer great-niece, Margi Marshland, shared how Tannie Cora had been feeling after her recent birthday, which they had feared might be her last.\n\nLast year, we thought it would be her last birthday.\n\nShe got very sick, and she even told us she was ready to meet the Lord. But this year, she started asking about the days leading up to her birthday, counting them down. Its a blessing to spend another birthday with her.\n\nMarshlands sister, Berit Bradfield, and family friend Alet Steenkamp expressed gratitude for every moment spent with Tannie Cora.\n\nWe are thankful to the Lord for sparing her another year, Marshland said. There are good and bad days, but today, were just happy to be with her. Even when shes not as talkative, you can still feel her presence.\n\nLife Lessons from Tannie Cora include, You can make life very beautiful just by having a united family; Learn how to get along with people; It takes a lot of energy and patience to be a parent; Dont assume that another person is a fool; being late is an insult and disrespectful to those waiting for you; friends are very important and never forget your sense of humour.\n\n",

This marked the beginning of Gumbos downfall as his web of deceit began to unravel.\n\nGumbo reportedly fled the school premises last Friday night as law enforcement agents came to investigate the matter and question him.\n\nThe scandal came to light after one of the pupils required medical attention following an alleged assault by Gumbo. This medical intervention, like Pandoras Box, unleashed a torrent of accusations.\n\nIn a letter addressed to parents and guardians Wednesday, headmaster Albion Masukume confirmed that investigations are underway, involving both the police and the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education.\n\nI write with deep sorrow to inform you that allegations of child abuse by one of our staff members was reported, he said.\n\nCurrently thorough investigations by Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education and the police are underway. The alleged victim was taken to hospital swiftly and was examined by a medical doctor.\n\nA police report was filed with the Victim Friendly Unit at Mberengwa Charge Office the same day. Meanwhile the alleged perpetrator is not at the station and being sought after for interrogation so that he responds to the allegations, reads part of the letter dated April 3, 2025.\n\nWhile Midlands provincial police spokesperson Inspector Emmanuel Mahoko would neither confirm nor deny the incident to NewZimbabwe.com. He was quoted in a State-run newspaper confirming the incident.\n\nHowever, when contacted by this publication, Mahoko denied ever speaking to any journalist concerning the matter.\n\nTafanana Zhou, legislator for Mberengwa North, which encompasses Masase High School, confirmed the assaults but refrained from speculating on the number of victims.\n\nWe need to wait for investigations to complete so that we will be able to establish the number of learners that were involved in this incident. We should not speculate.\n\nObert Masaraure, President of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ), condemned the alleged abuse, urging the school to bolster its safeguarding procedures.\n\nThe molestation of children at a learning institution is extremely worrisome, he said.\n\nSchools should be safe for both teachers and learners. ARTUZ has proposed safe schools regulations and if these had been adopted such incidents would have been avoided.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, engaging in sexual acts with a minor under 18, including sodomy, is illegal under Section 73 (3) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act Chapter 9:23 and carries a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.\n\n",

            "content": "When it comes to e-sports, where the stakes are great and the competition is fierce, emotional intelligence (EI) is essential. Emotionally intelligent teams are known for being tough, communicating eloquently, and having strong team dynamics, all of which are important for winning competitive games. When integrated well, EI helps these efforts and turns possible losses into chances to win. For a more profound understanding of how emotional intelligence can shape successful esports teams,Avia Mastersoffers further insights.\n\nUnderstanding EI in Esports\n\nIn e-sports, emotional intelligence (EI) is a key factor that affects how teams communicate and work together. Teams with higher emotional intelligence understand and care about each other more, which makes working together much easier. This knowledge helps the team work together better and communicate more clearly.\n\nEI is also essential to managing disagreements within teams. Being aware of and controlling individual and team emotions can prevent arguments from worsening. This helps the team stay focused and work together and strengthens them overall, so they can handle the pressure of competitive play and adapt to constantly changing conditions.\n\nWhen there is a lot of pressure to do well in e-sports, teams that can talk to each other and work out their differences are more likely to win. Emotional intelligence helps people on a team say what they want to say, listen carefully, and reply to each other with understanding and empathy.\n\nBuilding Trust Through EI\n\nWhen people on an e-sports team feel understood and respected, they are much more likely to trust each other. This is called emotional intelligence (EI). EI leaders are good at recognising and controlling their emotions as well as understanding and reacting to the emotions of the people on their team. Being able to do this makes you more empathetic, which is important for making strong, trusting connections.\n\nGood conversation is key to emotional intelligence and building trust. Leaders and team members can avoid misunderstandings and ensure that everyones voice is heard and valued by listening carefully and responding with care. In addition, EI helps team members handle disagreements in a healthy way by focussing on solutions instead of blaming each other.\n\nTraining and Development\n\nEsports teams can improve their emotional intelligence by using various training programmes meant to boost teamwork and success. Workshops and classes that cover important EI skills, like self-awareness, empathy, and interpersonal communication skills, are common parts of effective EI training. During these meetings, team members usually learn about EI in a theoretical way and then apply what theyve learned to practical situations.\n\nFurthermore, role-playing and simulation games are helpful because they let team members practise controlling their emotions and reacting with empathy in different situations. Mindfulness and stress management training can also be added to help team members better control their emotions and stay strong.\n\nPhoto byAxvilleonUnsplash\n\nPsychological Aspects and Winning Mindset\n\nEmotional intelligence (EI) greatly affects the mental and emotional skills needed to perform at your best in e-sports.\n\nHere are some key benefits of EI in developing a winning mindset and enhancing team resilience:\n\n",
