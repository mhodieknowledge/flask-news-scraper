            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE ruling party, Zanu PF has won the Chinhoyi Ward 14 seat in a by-election which the opposition Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) boycotted.\n\nOf the 2,339 registered voters in the ward, only a third turned out to cast their ballots. A NewZimbabwe.com crew witnessed the low voter attendance at the main polling station at Alaska Dolomite Primary School.\n\nDespite the apathy by the majority of the electorate, Zanu PF candidate Solomon Bizwork garnered 599 votes against his rival Hope Zimbiri, who scrapped only 194 votes. Statistics show that the turnout was 33 percent of registered voters.\n\nZimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) presiding officer, Taona Pfunye confirmed the results as posted at the polling station.\n\nBouyed by support from Zanu PF bigwigs, including President Emmerson Mnangagwas advisor, Paul Tungwarara ahead of polls, Biswork promised to champion infrastructural development, including six boreholes to ease water supply crisis in the mining settlement, fixing roads and initiating community business start-ups.\n\nOn the other hand, Zimbiri pursued a quiet election campaign if any, never convened a single rally and was literally off the medias radar.\n\nThe Chinhoyi Ward 14 post became vacant following the jailing of then-councillor and deputy mayor Chipo Mlotshwa of CCC on fraud charges involving double-dipping in the allocation of land. Her sentence was however commuted to community service.\n\nMeanwhile, in Harares Epworth Ward 6, Zanu PF candidate Civilised Bushe won by a huge margin, amassing 3,022 votes trailed by MDC-Ts Alice Nyahunzvi, who managed 120 votes, while independent candidate Peter Nyapetwa got a measly 23 votes.\n\nZEC presiding officer, Chenjerai Chirere confirmed the results.\n\n",
