He was a good man. Who will do everything he did for us now?\n\nThe police are working on this case, and in this country nothing of this nature goes unpunished. Justice will be served. This will not simply end, the culprits will be brought to book, and the truth will come out no matter what, Machakaire said.\n\nAccording to police, seven masked suspects armed with pistols, crowbars, and hammers overpowered a security guard manning Mutangaduras house. They tied him up and forced him to the farmhouse, which they broke into using metal bars.\n\nThe suspects then forced the guard and Mutangaduras son to lie down in the dining room before proceeding to the victims bedroom, where he was sleeping with his wife.\n\nThey shot him in the stomach, ransacked the house and fled.\n\nMutangadura and his wife were later found unconscious.\n\nHe died from his injuries, while his wife survived.\n\nMeanwhile police investigations are still underway, and no arrests have been made yet.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nTHE government has maintained the ban on fishing activities in Lake Chivero due to serious environmental and public health risks posed by the ongoing contamination of the water body, a Cabinet minister has said.\n\nResponding to a written question (question with notice) on the issue by Zanu PF Zvimba East MP Kudakwashe Mananzva last Wednesday, Environment, Climate and Wildlife Minister Evelyn Ndlovu said Cabinet reaffirmed its decision to maintain the fishing ban owing to the significant pollution risks, particularly from untreated industrial effluent and raw soils discharged by surrounding local authorities.Mananzva had asked the minister when the ban on fishing activities in Lake Chivero would be lifted considering that many livelihoods of surrounding communities depended on this activity.I wish to inform this House that Cabinet has reaffirmed its decision to maintain the fishing ban at Lake Chivero. This decision is based on significant pollution risks, particularly from untreated industrial effluent and raw soils discharged by surrounding local authorities.The ban will not be lifted until the root cause of this pollution is comprehensively addressed by the three local authorities around that place, including Norton, Ndlovu said.She added that the government was concerned about public health.We are concerned about public health. While previous assessments by the Health and Child Care minister indicated that fish from the lake may be safe for consumption, Cabinet has taken a holistic view that the ongoing contamination of the lake poses serious environmental and public health risks, said Ndlovu.The safety of fish alone, she further explained, was insufficient grounds to lift the ban because the water was still contaminated.In line with Cabinets directive, my ministry is coordinating a multi-stakeholder response to address the pollution crisis.This includes strengthening regulatory oversight of industrial and municipal discharges, implementing pollution mitigation measures particularly in effluent and sewage management, advancing ecosystem rehabilitation efforts in collaboration with City of Harare, the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) and the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks).According to her, a time-bound action plan was being developed and a joint monitoring framework will be established to track progress and ensure accountability.Ndlovu told the acting Speaker that regular updates will be submitted to the Office of the President and Cabinet (OPC) and if necessary, regular updates would be done in Parliament.We recognise the socio-economic importance of fishing to communities around Lake Chivero.However, any decision to lift the ban must prioritise public health and ecological integrity. We are committed to ensuring that the lake can once again support sustainable livelihoods but only when it is safe to do so, stated Ndlovu.The minister said the government remained resolute in its commitment to resolving the pollution crisis at Lake Chivero.The fishing ban will stay in force until the underlying environmental challenges are effectively addressed.We request the continued patience and cooperation of affected communities as we work towards a cleaner, healthier and more sustainable Lake Chivero which is one of our biggest wetlands.MP Mananzva reminded the temporary Speaker that hunger had no patience.Yes, they are supposed to be patient but hunger is not patient. What plans do you have with these people?Ndlovu said there was need to come up with more projects rather than relying on fishing alone for those affected.However, Dzivarasekwa Citizens Coalition for Change MP Edwin Mushoriwa told the acting Speaker that the ban on fishing at the lake had intensified poaching.Is the Minister aware that the banning of fishing, notwithstanding the reasonable grounds why the government has banned the fishing, is the minister aware that poaching has intensified?Right now, if you go to areas like Kuwadzana, Dzivarasekwa and Norton, people are still eating that fish, courtesy of the poachers, Mushoriwa said.Ndlovu responded, saying her ministry was working with several stakeholders including the Health ministry and fishing cooperatives to alert the public on the dangers of consuming fish from the lake.The law enforcement should be there to protect our people from eating such fish, she said.\n\nResponding to a written question (question with notice) on the issue by Zanu PF Zvimba East MP Kudakwashe Mananzva last Wednesday, Environment, Climate and Wildlife Minister Evelyn Ndlovu said Cabinet reaffirmed its decision to maintain the fishing ban owing to the significant pollution risks, particularly from untreated industrial effluent and raw soils discharged by surrounding local authorities.\n\nMananzva had asked the minister when the ban on fishing activities in Lake Chivero would be lifted considering that many livelihoods of surrounding communities depended on this activity.I wish to inform this House that Cabinet has reaffirmed its decision to maintain the fishing ban at Lake Chivero.

this year on allegations of stealing sugarcane.\n\nThe three security guards are Makina Ngwenya, Benjamin Dube and Munorwei Gomondera.In a viral video on social media earlier this year, the children were filmed lying down on their bellies while one of the guards flogged them.Parents and guardians of the school children, who are aged between 13 and 17 years, through the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR), filed summons at Chipinge Magistrates Court Friday against the three security guards and their employer for unlawful assault and ill-treatment.According to the childrens lawyers, Peggy Tavagadza and Tatenda Sigauke, the minors sustained serious injuries from the beatings.The children sustained injuries from the assault and experienced swollen backsides and were not able to walk properly for some time.They experienced shock, pain and suffering both physical and psychological, emotional trauma and distress, contumelia and suffered public humiliation while their dignity and bodily integrity was violated.The assault was grievous and psychologically traumatising due to the students young ages and the viral effect of the videos, which circulated on online platforms, the lawyers said.Sigauke and Tavagadza also want the court to order Ngwenya, Dube, Gomondera and Green Fuel to pay a total of US$110 000, which entails payment of US$10 000 to each student, for damages for pain and suffering, shock, trauma, contumelia and violation of dignity.The human rights lawyers are also demanding that Green Fuel publicly apologizes to the learners, their families, and the Chisumbanje community, condemn the guards actions, and commit to preventing similar abuses in future.The legal team also wants Green Fuels apology published in a local Manicaland newspaper, aired daily on Vemuganga Community Radio for five days, and displayed on the companys social media and notice boards for 14 days.\n\nThe three security guards are Makina Ngwenya, Benjamin Dube and Munorwei
