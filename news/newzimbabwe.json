The complainants indicated that the three had informed them that they were heading to the game reserve, but strangely, they never returned, said Mdhluli.\n\nInvestigating police officers took the complainants and headed to the game reserve.\n\nAt the game reserve, police officers were informed by officials that certain individuals frequently gain entry into the premises without authorization.\n\nFurther information indicated that, about a week ago, there were some people that were noticed at the game reserve, but (the trespassers) fled upon noticing the authorities and were never seen again, said Mdhluli.\n\nPolice officers then continued with their investigations around the premises, and noticed three bodies floating in the Nkomazi River.\n\nThe SAPS team from search and rescue, as well as divers, were summoned to the scene. The three bodies were retrieved from the river, hence an inquest case is being probed in order to establish the cause of death, said Mdluli.\n\nPolice said a postmortem will be conducted, and the identities of the three men will be shared in due course, once their next of kin are notified.\n\nPreliminary investigation by the police has thus far revealed that the men are originally from Zimbabwe, said Mdhluli.\n\nMeanwhile, acting provincial commissioner of SAPS in Mpumalanga, Major General Zeph Mkhwanazi has since ordered a thorough investigation into the shocking incident to unveil the truth of what has actually transpired, leading to the death of the three individuals.\n\nEarlier this month,IOL reported thatAsher Watkins, a millionaire from the United States of America, was gored to death by a buffalo he was hunting in Limpopo.\n\nThe 52-year-old hunter had reportedly paid Coernraad Vermaak Safaris around R177,221 for the trip in which he planned to stalk and kill wild animals in the expedition.\n\nIt is with deep sadness and heavy hearts that we confirm the tragic death of our client and friend Asher Watkins from the USA. While on ahuntingsafari with us in Limpopo province, Asher was fatally injured in a sudden and unprovoked attack by an unwounded buffalo.\n\nAmerican millionaire Asher Watkins poses wth one of his kills before the tables turned on him and he was gored to death by a Cape buffalo during a hunting trip.

This is a devastating incident, and our hearts go out to his loved ones, said the safaris Hans Vermaak in a statement.\n\nThe safari said Cape buffalo have some of the most fearsome reputations on the planet.\n\nResponsible for several deaths and many injuries to hunters each year, the buffalo is regarded as the most dangerous animal to pursue in Africa, let alone the world, the safari said on its website.\n\n",

            "content": "By Kudzai Tamary Chikiwa | Global Voices\n\nZimbabwes public debt servicing crisis has had far-reaching consequences for the countrys healthcare system. With a significant portion of thenational budgetdedicated to debt repayment, the healthcare sector has been left underfunded and understaffed. This has resulted in a shortage of critical equipment, medicines, and healthcare personnel, ultimately affecting the quality of care provided to patients.The story of Memory Ncube, a Zimbabwean motherand her baby, Tendai, is a tragic illustration of the human cost of this crisis.\n\nIn the quiet moments, Memorys mind wanders back to the day her world shattered. Her preterm baby girl, Tendai, had been fighting for her life, struggling with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). In a bid to save the new life, Memory was transferred from rural Zvishavane district hospital toMpilo Central HospitalinBulawayo, Zimbabwes second-largest city. This was not because the doctors in Zvishavane were incompetent, but because they lacked the necessary equipment, including a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine.\n\nFull of hope that her child would make it, Memory traveled 185 kilometers (114.954 miles) toMpilo Central Hospital, which is one of the referral hospitals for patients from the Southern region of Zimbabwe. Recently, the hospital received a lifeline in the form of a donation from theHigherlife Foundation, which provided critical equipment, including CPAP machines, suction machines, monitors, jaundice meters, and phototherapy machines. Prior to this donation, the hospital had been grappling with a shortage of equipment, often resulting in premature deaths of patients.\n\nHowever, tragically for this family, when she arrived at the hospital, it was too late, and her daughter had died. She sobbingly recalled her babys death:\n\nMy heart breaks when I think of what happened to my daughter. If only there was equipment at the hospital, I was not going to travel all this way with a critical baby. I wish the government knew the devastating impact of not servicing public hospitals.\n\nZimbabwes public debt servicing has become a suffocating burden, squeezing the life out of the healthcare system. Witha total public debt of approximately USD 21.53 billion, with much of it owed to the World Bank, China, France, and other international creditors, the governments debt repayment obligations are consuming a significant chunk of the national budget. In the 2025 budget, theMinistry of Health and Child Carewas allocated ZWD 27.8 billion (approximately USD 1.039 billion), just 7.1 percent of public spending, which falls short of theAbuja Declarations 15 percent allocation target.\n\nTheAbuja Declarationis a commitment made byAfrican Unionmember states, including Zimbabwe, in 2001 to allocate at least 15 percent of their national budgets to improve the healthcare system.\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncube has defended the move, saying,\n\nWe need to go through some period of austerity, but the same builds us towards prosperity.\n\nHowever, for Memory and countless other mothers, the prosperity promised seems a distant dream. Memorys baby is just one of many newborns who die before they reach one month in Zimbabwe. The neonatal mortality rate in Zimbabwe stands at37 deaths per 1,000 live births, a grim statistic that reflects the human cost of inadequate healthcare funding.\n\nCommunity Working Group on Health ZimbabweExecutive Director Itai Rusike concurred that the health sector remains distressed due to public debt servicing. He explained:\n\nShortages in healthcare personnel, inadequate infrastructure, high disease burden, and expensive specialist services continue to affect service delivery. These systemic issues are compounded by low public spending on health and weak financial protection mechanisms. Unfortunately, its the poor who suffer the most.\n\nHe emphasised the need for increased investment in building a robust and accessible health system, particularly in rural areas. He noted:\n\nAchieving universal health coverage requires strong public funding and a commitment to treating healthcare as a fundamental right.\n\nTo challenge economic injustice and notorious austerity measures, organizations like theEconomic Justice for Women Projectare educating women on public finances. The project aims to empower women with knowledge about public debt and its impact on service delivery, enabling them to advocate for change. Director Margaret Mutsamvi said:\n\nIssues to do with public debt seem complicated and elitist, but we are now going down to communities to educate them. We take time to explain to them the nexus between public debt servicing and service delivery. This can help them challenge the status quo from an informed perspective.\n\nMutsamvi reiterated that when a government introduces austerity measures in favor of public debt servicing, its the ordinary citizens who suffer.\n\nRight now, our health system is in shambles because a huge chunk of money is put towards clearing external and internal debt. The ordinary people suffer; this is why we have a high neonatal mortality rate in Zimbabwe. Women are the most affected, as they bear the brunt of austerity measures.\n\nShe added:\n\nWhen the government is prioritising public debt servicing it affects public hospitals. This is why there is a rise of privatisation of health facilities, mushrooming of private hospitals, clinics and pharmacies. Sometimes we have seen cases where there are no painkillers in hospitals and its even worse in rural areas. When the government is not funding, Its a woman who is paying for it.\n\nShe continued:\n\nWomen bear the pain of losing a child, caring for the sick at home and going through all the emotional stress. This is unpaid carework.\n\nThe story of Memory and her baby, Tendai, is a heartbreaking reminder of the human cost of Zimbabwes debt crisis. It is a call to action for policymakers to prioritize the health and well-being of the nations most vulnerable citizens.\n\n",

When news initially broke that TV and radio presenter and DJ Lerato Kganyagos husband had acquired a mall, of course, curiosity was piqued.At the grand opening of Ndlala Mall, one finally laid their eyes on Ndlala Mall, previously called Sterland Mall.The white building in Arcadia, Pretoria, is hard to miss, located on a corner for all to see. Renovations are underway to the centre that was once a popular mall that attracted movie goers.Hosting a major event for the first time comes with plenty of stress, anything can go wrong and the first night of Ndlala Malls grand opening was not without mishaps.Guests arrived at the arena to find it beautifully decorated in black and gold, with an area for VVIP guests, who got to enjoy a delicious but cold meal.The diamond package promised ticket-holders bottomless Dom Perignon but one woman was left flabbergasted when she only got one glass and was given Veuve Clicquot. However, French champagne is champagne though.Water is one of lifes ultimate necessities, but sadly guests were once again left speechless, when they ordered water and the service staff told them, neither still or sparkling water was available.Actress and media personality Khanyi Mbau was the MC for night one of Ndlala Malls grand launch.Guests finally entered the arena and the soft R&B sounds played, the mood began to lift and laughter started to fill the air. Excitement filled the room when actress and media personality Khanyi Mbau entered the stage to MC the launch.Mbau, a Dubai resident, made sure to lift the crowds spirits, as she did the dance challenge in her name, announcing her arrival.Musician Langa Mavuso proved to be a fitting opening act, as he warmed up the audience for what was to come.The arena proved to be an amazing venue for live experiences, as when Joe Thomas entered the arena, no sound or technical issues were in sight. The award-winning musician performed his classic hit songs that hit home with many of the attendees making them forget any inconvenience they encountered.To the end of his performance, Thomas brought Ndlala on to the stage to thank him for bringing him to perform and giving him his first star, which is placed on the entryway of the mall. The two have formed quite the friendship with Thomas calling him a friend and as the Americans say brother.Ndlala proved to be a man of a few words when put on the spot and simply thanked guests for attending and supporting the occasion.A few celebrities were spotted from Londie London, Zari The Boss Lady, Buhle Samuels, Blue Mbombo and Lerato Sengadi.Night two of the Ndlala Mall opening had American singer Donell Jones headline and Vusi Nova as supporting acts and Somizi Mhlongo as the MC.\n\nAfter dazzling audiences at the Womens Day Concert, Thomas extended his stay to perform at the grand launch of Ndlala Mall.\n\nNdlala Mall is owned by businessman Thami Ndlala.
