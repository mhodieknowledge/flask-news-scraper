Zambia and Zimbabwe are among the hardest hit countries, facing frequent power outages due to reduced water levels in Lake Kariba, which have caused a 25% drop in hydroelectric output.\n\nParticipants are expected to review the progress of the Mission 300 initiative, a project backed by the World Bank and African Development Bank that aims to expand energy access to 600 million people in the region by 2030, with the first target being 300 million.\n\nThe agenda also includes discussions on developing the petroleum and gas sectors, as well as adopting emerging technologies such as green hydrogen and smart grids. The Ministers will consider recommendations from a recent regional dialogue on ensuring a just transition to sustainable energy in Southern Africa.\n\nOn the water front, the meeting will evaluate advances in transboundary water management projects, led by River Basin Organisations and other shared institutions, including groundwater and livelihood support programmes.\n\nProfessor Obert Jiri, Permanent Secretary in Zimbabwes Ministry of Lands, Agriculture and Water Development and Chair of the water officials committee, highlighted the critical link between energy and water resources.\n\nSolar power and energy recovered from landfill gases demonstrate the close relationship between water and energy, he said. Managing water resources effectively is vital, not just for energy generation but also as a response to climate change. A small rise in temperature can significantly reduce water availability in our region, affecting agriculture and livelihoods.\n\nHe added that this meeting is crucial for exploring ways to improve water access for irrigation and energy production, both of which are essential for the regions development.\n\n",

            "content": "CNN\n\nTelevangelist Jimmy Swaggart, who became a household name amassing an enormous following and multimillion-dollar ministry only to be undone by his penchant for prostitutes, has died.\n\nSwaggart died decades after his once vast audience dwindled and his name became a punchline on late night television. His death was announced Tuesday on his public Facebook page. A cause wasnt immediately given, though at 90 he had been in poor health.\n\nThe Louisiana native was best known for being a captivating Pentecostal preacher with a massive following before being caught on camera with a prostitute in New Orleans in 1988, one of a string of successful TV preachers brought down in the 1980s and 90s by sex scandals. He continued preaching for decades, but with a reduced audience.\n\nSwaggart encapsulated his downfall in a tearful 1988 sermon, in which he wept and apologized but made no reference to his connection to a prostitute.\n\nI have sinned against you, Swaggart told parishioners nationwide. I beg you to forgive me.\n\nHe announced his resignation from the Assemblies of God later that year, shortly after the church said it was defrocking him for rejecting punishment it had ordered for moral failure. The church had wanted him to undergo a two-year rehabilitation program, including not preaching for a full year.\n\nSwaggart said at the time that he knew dismissal was inevitable but insisted he had no choice but to separate from the church to save his ministry and Bible college.\n\nSwaggart grew up poor, the son of a preacher, in a music-rich family. He excelled at piano and gospel music, playing and singing with talented cousins who took different paths: rock-n-rollerJerry Lee Lewisand country singerMickey Gilley.\n\nIn his hometown of Ferriday, Louisiana, Swaggart said he first heard the call of God at age 8. The voice gave him goose bumps and made his hair tingle, he said.\n\nEverything seemed different after that day in front of the Arcade Theater, he said in a 1985 interview with the Jacksonville Journal-Courier in Illinois. I felt better inside. Almost like taking a bath.\n\nHe preached and worked part time in oil fields until he was 23. He then moved entirely into his ministry: preaching, playing piano and singing gospel songs with the barrelhouse fervor of cousin Lewis at Assemblies of God revivals and camp meetings.\n\nSwaggart started a radio show, a magazine, and then moved into television, with outspoken views.\n\nHe called Roman Catholicism a false religion. It is not the Christian way, and claimed that Jews suffered for thousands of years because of their rejection of Christ.\n\nIf you dont like what I say, talk to my boss, he once shouted as he strode in front of his congregation at his Family Worship Center in Baton Rouge, where his sermons moved listeners to speak in tongues and stand up as if possessed by the Holy Spirit.\n\nSwaggarts messages stirred thousands of congregants and millions of TV viewers, making him a household name by the late 1980s. Contributors built Jimmy Swaggart Ministries into a business that made an estimated $142 million in 1986.\n\nHis Baton Rouge complex still includes a worship center and broadcasting and recording facilities.\n\nSwaggarts downfall came in the late 1980s as other prominent preachers faced similar scandals. Swaggart said publicly that his earnings were hurt in 1987 by the sex scandal surroundingrival televangelist Jim Bakkerand a former church secretary at Bakkers PTL ministry organization.\n\nJimmy Swaggart Ministry/WBRZ-TV/Bettmann/Getty Images\n\nThe following year, Swaggart was photographed at a hotel with Debra Murphree, an admitted prostitute who told reporters that the two did not have sex but that the preacher had paid her to pose nude.\n\nShe later repeated the claim  and posed nude  for Penthouse magazine.\n\nThe surveillance photos that crippled Swaggarts career apparently stemmed from his rivalry with preacher Marvin Gorman, whom Swaggart had accused of sexual misdeeds. Gorman hired the photographer who captured Swaggart and Murphree on film. Swaggart later paid Gorman $1.8 million to settle a lawsuit over the sexual allegations against Gorman.\n\nMore trouble came in 1991, when police in California detained Swaggart with another prostitute. The evangelist was charged with driving on the wrong side of the road and driving an unregistered Jaguar. His companion, Rosemary Garcia, said Swaggart became nervous when he saw the police car and weaved when he tried to stuff pornographic magazines under a car seat.\n\nSwaggart was later mocked by the late TV comic Phil Hartman, who impersonated him on NBCs Saturday Night Live.\n\nThe evangelist largely stayed out of the news in later years but remained in the pulpit at Jimmy Swaggart Ministries, often joined by his son, Donnie, a fellow preacher. His radio station broadcast church services and gospel music to 21 states, and Swaggarts ministry boasted a worldwide audience on the internet.\n\nTheres been no greater example of a good and faithful servant than my father. No ifs, ands and buts about it. A man who lived his life for the cause of Christ, Donnie Swaggart said in avideo message sharedon social media Sunday about his dads final days.\n\nThe preacher caused another brief stir in 2004 with remarks about being looked at amorously by a gay man.\n\nAnd Im going to be blunt and plain: If one ever looks at me like that, Im going to kill him and tell God he died, Jimmy Swaggart said, to laughter from the congregation. He later apologized.\n\nSwaggart made few public appearances outside his church, save for singing Amazing Grace at the 2005 funeral of Louisiana Secretary of State Fox McKeithen, a prominent name in state politics for decades.\n\nIn 2022, he shared memories at thememorial servicefor Lewis, his cousin and rock n roll pioneer. The pair had released The Boys From Ferriday, a gospel album, earlier that year.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\n1 July remains etched in the hearts of millions of Zimbabweans, 26 years after the passing of Father Zimbabwe and former Vice President Dr Joshua Nkomo. His legacy transcends political divides as the nation unites to honour a man who fought for liberation, only to discover that even freedom did not free his people from the chains of colonialism.\n\nNkomos popularity soared both before and after independence. In the darkest days of the 1980s, he fled the country when then Prime Minister Robert Mugabe deployed North Korean-trained troops known as the Fifth Brigade into parts of Midlands and Matabeleland provinces, killing about 20 000 Ndebele-speaking people and ZAPU supporters.\n\nUnder the pretext of quelling renegades, these forces committed gross atrocities against those seen as aligned with Nkomo. Nkomos statue, erected in Bulawayo, a bronze likeness by North Koreas Mansudae Art Studio, stands at the intersection of Joshua Nkomo Street and 8th Avenue, a testament to his enduring influence.\n\nIn a statement on Tuesday, President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who oversaw those very operations as state security minister then, described Dr Nkomo as a liberator and champion of Pan-Africanism.\n\nMnangagwa praised Nkomo affectionately known as Chibwe Chitedza for enduring imprisonment in places like Gonakudzingwa and for never compromising his spirit.\n\nChibwe Chitedza as Dr Nkomo came to be popularly known, endured imprisonment in notorious camps such as Gonakudzingwa, but the colonial efforts failed to break his spirit. Today, twenty-six years later, Zimbabwe can look back with pride to the life of a liberator, an astute politician, a champion of Pan-Africanism, he said.\n\nMnangagwa lauded Nkomo as a beacon of peace and unity, invoking his commitment to reconciliation and national cohesion.\n\nUmdala wethu and his generation of impeccable revolutionaries always preached peace as the bedrock of nation building. We are using the peace dividend to implement pro-people oriented policies and high impact programmes and projects in our endeavour to deliver decent livelihoods to all citizens in a free democratic Zimbabweans.\n\nZanu-PF politburo member Tendai Chirau echoed this sentiment, acknowledging Nkomos role in the liberation struggle and describing him as a selfless statesman, whose vision remains a benchmark of leadership today.\n\nA visionary who began the fight against colonialism in his youth, Cde Nkomo was a true statesman whose leadership left indelible marks on history. Though he is no longer with us, his legacy endures as a timeless template of selfless leadership, Chirau wrote on his X account on Tuesday.\n\nYet, not all are convinced of Mnangagwas sincerity. Prince Dubekos Sibanda, former MP for Binga North, dismissed the commemoration as hollow.\n\nYour commemoration isnt sincere. You hated him to the bone, he wrote on X.\n\nOther critics described the tribute as crocodile tears, accusing Mnangagwa of hypocrisy in light of past violence against Nkomos supporters.\n\nOne X handle by Mr Matebele wrote: Emmerson and Robert Mugabe tormented this man, funny how today you are remembering him after killing his commanders and people of Matebelelandwhat a disgrace.\n\nOpposition voices, including Gift Ostalos Siziba, former MP for Tshabalala, lauded Nkomo as a revolutionary icon with extraordinary character and unwavering discipline and recalled his enduring words: Zimbabwe will not die, its young people will save it. These, he said, continue to inspire future leaders.\n\nDr Joshua Nkomo was born on 19 June 1917 in Matopo, a coalition builder who co-founded the National Democratic Party in 1960 and later ZAPU.\n\nAfter being jailed by the Rhodesian government in 1964, he returned to lead resistance efforts.\n\nNkomos life remains a symbol of unity and resilience. Zanu PF, in its last annual conference in Bulawayo last year, passed a resolution to pronounce July 1, each year, a public holiday, but it has not been sanctioned by Mnangagwa himself.\n\nDr Nkomo died on 1 July 1999 at Parirenyatwa Hospital in Harare and was interred at the National Heroes Acre in Harare. He was 82.\n\n",

            "content": "As the rise of neobanks and digital-first services reshapes the financial landscape, traditional institutions are under pressure to modernize. But while face-to-face identity checks are straightforward, doing the same online is far more complex. How can businesses verify identities remotely, securely, and efficiently?\n\nThe answer lies in eKYCshort for electronic Know Your Customer. This digital approach to verifying customer identity is now a cornerstone of modern financial services, enabling fast, secure, and scalable customer onboarding.\n\neKYCis the digital counterpart of traditional KYC procedures. It allows companies to verify identities without requiring physical presence or paper-based documentation. By using biometric data, document scanning, and real-time analytics, eKYC systems authenticate users remotely, ensuring compliance and security while streamlining the user experience.\n\nWhile both eKYC and traditional KYC aim to prevent financial crime such as money laundering and terrorism financing, the key difference lies in how they operate. Traditional KYC relies on physical documents and in-person checks, whereaseKYC solutionsare fully automated, using facial recognition, liveness detection, and AI to validate identities.\n\nAdopted globally, eKYC technology has become especially prominent since 2022. Regulatory bodies, such as the Qatar Central Bank, have already established frameworks for eKYC verification, including allowing non-residents to onboard digitally with official approval.\n\nThe debate of eKYC vs KYC is really about automation and scale. Heres how they differ:\n\nAspect\n\nTraditional KYC\n\neKYC\n\nDocument Submission\n\nIn-person, physical documents\n\nOnline upload, real-time capture\n\nVerification Method\n\nManual inspection\n\nAutomated checks with AI and biometrics\n\nSpeed\n\nDays\n\nSeconds\n\nAccessibility\n\nLimited to branch hours\n\n24/7 global access\n\nCost\n\nHigh operational costs\n\nLower due to automation\n\nUltimately, eKYC solutions provide a faster, more efficient route to customer identity verificationespecially for remote and mobile-first environments.\n\nLets break down how a typical eKYC verification workflow works:\n\nIn a well-optimized flow, all these steps occur in secondsthanks to automated eKYC verification and seamless eKYC processes.\n\nAdopting eKYC technology offers organizations numerous advantages:\n\nThere are multiple eKYC types, depending on the channel and depth of verification:\n\nEach type offers a different balance of user convenience, speed, and regulatory compliance.\n\neKYC verification is being rapidly adopted across various sectors:\n\nExample: N26, a German neobank, uses automated eKYC solutions to autofill user data after scanning a document, expediting form completion.\n\nExample: Binance restricts unverified users to withdrawals only. Kraken mandates full eKYC verification to trade.\n\nAcross these industries, eKYC technology ensures security, compliance, and a frictionless customer experience.\n\nAs AI-generated photos and videos become more convincing, electronic Know Your Customer systems face rising fraud risks. A Regula study found over half of firms in Crypto and FinTech had encountered AI-driven spoofing.\n\nRegulations vary by region. For example, the Qatar Central Bank now mandates active liveness detectione.g., head movementson mobile apps and kiosks.\n\nRobust eKYC systems require high-performance servers, secure APIs, and advanced IDV tools. Companies must balance security with usability.\n\nFraudsters may exploit customer eKYC by mimicking reverification requests. Customers who recently completed verification are more likely to fall for scams.\n\nSolution: Launch fraud awareness hubs like Danske Banks support portal to educate users.\n\nThe shift toward digital banking and identity services makes eKYC more important than ever. With eKYC verification now a regulatory expectation in many countries, businesses that adopt this approach early will gain a competitive edge.\n\nWhether youre launching a neobank, enhancing a FinTech app, or optimizing compliance in crypto, investing in eKYC technology ensures secure and seamless customer onboarding. And as digital identity wallets and verifiable credentials evolve under initiatives like the EUs eIDAS update, eKYC solutions will only grow more robust and reusable.\n\nNow is the time to modernize your identity verification strategy. With partners like Regula, you can deploy advanced document verification, facial recognition, and liveness detection toolsready to support your transformation into the future of secure digital finance.\n\n",
