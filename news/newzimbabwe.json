            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nHARARE Mayor, Jacob Mafume, has said the City Council is not remitting funds to Geo Pomona, despite the company taking over the municipalitys refuse collection mandate under controversial circumstances.\n\nGeo Pomona Waste Management is now responsible for garbage collection in Harare under a deal spearheaded by the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works.\n\nAccording to the initial agreement, the City Council was to pay US$40 per tonne to Geo Pomona for waste disposal, raising questions about the usurping of municipal functions by a private company.\n\nHowever, Mafume has disclosed that the local authority is not paying Geo Pomona, with the government instead footing the costs of refuse collection in Harare.\n\nThe City is not paying anything to Geo Pomona. It has not paid anything. The government is the one that is paying. The issue is, I manage the City, and the City is not paying, and my mandate, as we speak, is to manage City affairs, said Mafume.\n\nThe takeover of refuse collection has drawn criticism towards the Harare City Council, which residents accuse of privatising public services, thereby shifting the payment burden onto them.\n\nMafume, who was once opposed to private partnerships but now appears to be warming up to the idea, is actively seeking organisations or individuals to partner with, as the City Council struggles to fulfil its mandate in Harare.\n\nThe HCC has failed to construct and maintain existing infrastructure, leaving it in a state of dilapidation.\n\nHowever, questions have been raised about the councils sincerity in pursuing public-private partnerships, particularly after a fallout last year with Roadport Private Limited, which nearly led to the company being barred from operating long-distance bus terminals.\n\nMafume attempted to downplay the incident as he embarks on a charm offensive to woo potential partners.\n\nWhen you have a dispute with your partner, it does not mean your marriage is not producing fruits. A Roadport was built and is used by thousands of Harare residents. So, if we have a dispute on one or two issues, it does not mean that everything is lost.\n\nThere is a tendency to highlight the problems you would have faced in an agreement while ignoring everything that has been beneficial, said Mafume.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) says easing ZWG rates are indicative of the local currencys economic stabilising effect.\n\nThe ZiG month-on-month inflation slightly decreased to settle at 0.3% in the month of June 2025 from 0.9% recorded in the month of May 2025.\n\nThe prolonged period of inflation at rates below 1% since February 2025 generally reflect a ZiG price stabilising economy. In addition, this may also indicate success of monetary policy in restoring price discipline as compared to past experiences with the Zimbabwean dollar (ZWL), said CZI.\n\nThe industry lobby group said the low levels of inflation will help build trust in the currency, which might also encourage greater usage of ZiG in transactions and could also boost the likelihood of a gradual de-dollarisation process leading to a ZiG mono currency regime by 2030.\n\nThe ZiG year-on-year inflation rate slightly increased to settle at 92.5% in the month of June 2025 (Figure 2), gaining 0.4 percentage points from a rate of 92.1% recorded in May 2025. While the month-on-month inflation is showing that inflation is currently under control, the high annual inflation rate reflects historical price instability legacies whose effects are still at play, said CZI.\n\nThe industry lobby group said the high annual inflation level creates pricing uncertainty, making it difficult for businesses to set prices, forecast costs, or even to negotiate contracts.\n\nTherefore, sustaining month-on-month inflation at the current low rates is crucial for eliminating this high annual inflation, which is expected to only start falling in October 2025. Only then will restoring confidence in the ZiG, protecting real incomes, and supporting sustainable economic recovery become more realistic, added CZI.\n\n",

            "content": "UNICEF\n\nFrom 29 June to 4 July 2025, Zimbabwe conducted its second Joint External Evaluation (JEE) to assess the countrys capacity to prevent, detect, and respond to public health threats under the International Health Regulations (2005). The JEE, coordinated by the Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC) with support from WHO and partners, marks a critical milestone in strengthening Zimbabwes public health emergency preparedness and response systems.\n\nThe JEE is a voluntary, collaborative process used globally to assess a countrys readiness to manage infectious disease outbreaks and other health emergencies. It is conducted every five years, with the countrys first evaluation completed in 2018.\n\nThe JEE gives us a structured opportunity to check how ready we are to detect and respond to public health threats and we thank all the partners who have made this possible, said Dr Wenceslaus Nyamayaro, MoHCC Acting Chief Director, Public Health.\n\nThe internal self-assessment, the first phase of the JEE, was completed in July 2025 with over 100 participants from across sectors including health, environment, veterinary services, defense, disaster management, civil society, and development partners including WHO, UNICEF, FAO, Africa CDC and others. This participatory process assessed 19 technical areas ranging from biosafety and surveillance to legislation and points of entry.\n\nKey areas that emerged as requiring urgent attention include outdated or poorly implemented legal instruments, coupled with limited availability of legal support at subnational levels. Gender equity in emergencies remains a concern, with notable gaps in funding for gender-based violence (GBV) prevention and response, as well as low representation of women in emergency preparedness and decision-making processes. Funding for emergency response activities was also highlighted as inadequate.Surveillance systems for foodborne illnesses and healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are still fragmented, highlighting the need for stronger cross-sector coordination. Coordination between the human, animal and environmental health sectors is still weak, showing the need to improve how these groups work together. Biosafety and biosecurity capacities also require strengthening, particularly in terms of laboratory infrastructure and staff training. Additionally, readiness at points of entry remains limited, with gaps in the ability to detect and respond to public health threats at borders and airports.\n\nZimbabwe also assessed its progress in tackling antimicrobial resistance (AMR), a growing global threat. While the country has developed a robust One Health AMR National Action Plan and established 14 multisectoral surveillance sites, challenges remain in laboratory capacity, integration of data systems and containment of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs).\n\nThe next phase of the JEE will involve an external validation mission scheduled for 613 September 2025. A team of international subject matter experts, coordinated by WHOs Regional Office for Africa, will work with technical teams in Zimbabwe to validate scores, review documentation and conduct site visits to key health facilities including laboratories and points of entry. Following the mission, Zimbabwe will develop or update its National Action Plan for Health Security (NAPHS). This plan will consolidate findings from the JEE, past outbreak reviews, and risk assessments to guide future investments and reforms in public health preparedness.\n\nThe evaluation is about continuous improvement. It reflects Zimbabwes commitment to protect the health of its people through stronger systems, better data, and broader collaboration, said Dr. Desta Tiruneh, WHO Representative to Zimbabwe.\n\nThe evaluation was made possible with funding from the Health Resilience Fund (HRF) through WHO, with additional support mobilised by MoHCC from Africa CDC and UNICEF.\n\n",
