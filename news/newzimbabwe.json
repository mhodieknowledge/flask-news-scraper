            "content": "IOL\n\nThe Ministry of Health and Social Services (MoHSS) of Namibia has declared an outbreak of Mpox following the confirmation of the first case in Swakopmund, Erongo Region, on 18 October 2025.\n\nThe patient, who is being treated at the Swakopmund District Hospital, is stable and currently isolated, undergoing comprehensive medical care.\n\nThe preliminary investigation into the outbreak has indicated that this transmission may be linked to cross-border travel within the Southern African Development Community (SADC) region. In accordance with World Health Organisation (WHO) protocols, the detection of even a single confirmed case necessitates the declaration of an outbreak, prompting health authorities to launch an immediate response.\n\nThe MoHSS has assured the Namibian public that the countrys robust surveillance system is primed to identify and monitor individuals exhibiting signs of mpox. Additional cases are being actively sought, while health authorities in the Erongo region are closely monitoring the patients immediate contacts to prevent further spread of the virus.\n\nMpox is a zoonotic disease caused by an orthopox virus, resulting in smallpox-like symptoms in humans. This outbreak follows a concerning trend, as multiple countries within Africa, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Zambia, Malawi, and Tanzania, are reporting active mpox cases.\n\nMpox symptoms typically manifest after an incubation period ranging from 5 to 21 days and can include:\n\nThe rash often appears on the face, palms, and soles of the feet, and can also affect the mouth, genitals, and eyes. Symptoms generally last from two to four weeks, during which the infected individuals are capable of transmitting the virus to others.\n\nHuman-to-human transmission occurs primarily through direct contact with respiratory secretions, bodily fluids, or skin lesions of an infected person. The MoHSS outlines several potential avenues for transmission, including:\n\nAs mpox can affect anyone regardless of demographic, the MoHSS urges the public to take preventive measures. These include:\n\nIn light of this outbreak, the MoHSS has mobilised necessary resources to respond effectively, emphasising the importance of public cooperation. Citizens are encouraged to remain calm and to refrain from spreading unverified information, which could instigate unnecessary panic or stigma towards affected individuals and their families.\n\nAs Namibian health officials continue to monitor the situation closely, ongoing updates will be provided to keep the public informed. The health and well-being of all citizens remain a top priority for the government and health authorities.\n\n",

It does not end when the doors close; rather its an ecosystem that connects communities through their stories, said the founder.\n\nThe first edition of the conference saw more than 130 participants from across Africa and the diaspora.\n\nAfrotellers has grown into a continental movement connecting artists, activists and thinkers through community storytelling hubs in Malawi, South Africa, Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, DR Congo, Lesotho and Zimbabwe.\n\nFrom village gatherings to urban collectives, we are seeing a shared language of resistance, creativity and care emerging across Africa, Chivhanga said.\n\nThis years edition will build on the foundation that was laid in the previous year by exploring storytelling as infrastructure  shaping how Africans imagine themselves, relate to one another and influence how the continent is perceived globally.\n\nSome of the speakers for this years Afrotellers include playwright and scholar Dr Refiloe Lepere, Zimbabwean political organiser Gift Ostallos Siziba, visual activist Prof. Sir Zanele Muholi, Ugandan philanthropy leader Jackie Asiimwe, playwright and director Monageng Vice Motshabi and photographer Andrew Tshabangu.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nSouthern Africa-focused miner Kavango Resources has announced the discovery of a lucrative gold deposit at its Hillside Gold Project in Bulawayo, marking what the company describes as a breakthrough in its Zimbabwe operations.\n\nThe miner said its Nightshift Prospect has been confirmed as a gold deposit with significant upside potential, expected to deliver high ore and ounce yields per vertical metre. The company said the find aligns with its strategy to maximise gold production through modern, mechanised mining and processing methods.\n\nA preliminary JORC-compliant Mineral Resource Estimation has exceeded expectations, prompting Kavango to consider constructing an upgraded 300-tonne-per-day gold processing plant at the Bills Luck Gold Mine, up from the originally planned 200 tpd capacity.\n\nKavango Resources CEO Ben Turney described the discovery as a landmark achievement for the company.\n\nThis maiden JORC resource at Nightshift is a defining moment for Kavango. It proves that our gold development strategy in Zimbabwe is working and that our decision to focus on near-surface, fast-track production targets is delivering results, he said.\n\nTurney added that when the company began exploration at Hillside in mid-2023, its goal was to identify deposits that could fast-track gold production using advanced mining and processing methods.\n\nThis is a fantastic accomplishment by our team, who deserve all the praise for the hard work they have put into making this happen. Our initial drilling covered only about 15% of the known 700-metre strike, and just 50m vertical depth, because we were focused on defining a starter resource to underpin early cash flow and prove the concept.\n\nThe fact that the results have exceeded expectations at this stage gives us strong confidence in the greater potential of Nightshift. Given we encountered gold-bearing structures >200m vertical below surface during exploration, we are particularly excited for the underground mining possibilities here, added Turney.\n\n",
