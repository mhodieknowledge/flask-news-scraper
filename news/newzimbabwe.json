I lost everything I believed in. I slept on sofas.I continued with dignity and went on.There are so many wars, so many inequalities, so much discrimination. Reading is enriched by the immigrants who are here. Lets not forget the people who work in the NHS, they came to shine when I had aggressive breast cancer.Cllr Mpofu-Coles published her memoir Dear God from Your Poached Egg Breast in 2019, which reflects on her life in Zimbabwe, her battle with cancer and her faith in God.She was elected as a Labour councillor for Whitley three times in a row in 2021, 2022 and 2023.Cllr Mpofu-Coles said: I thank Almighty God for the grace he has given me in my life. Thanks to the residents of Reading for voting for me in 2021, 22 and 23.

ongoing criminal case.According to the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC), in March 2025, one complainant leased her truck for transporting agricultural goods from Honde Valley to Harare.On March 26, the truck was impounded by Tivafukidze and Masase, at a road block in Marara area on suspicion of transporting smuggled goods, said ZACC in a statement.The trucks cargo owners were also arrested at that time.After the incident, Chavarika, who was prosecuting the related case, allegedly contacted one of the complainants on April 3, summoning her to Hauna.There, Tivafukidze and Chavarika who are stationed at Mutasa Police Station allegedly demanded a US$500 bribe to secure the trucks release.The complainant initially paid US$170 in cash and then transferred an additional US$100 via Ecocash the following day.Despite assurances from Chavarika that the truck would be released by April 9, it was instead directed to the ZIMRA compound at Forbes Border Post.Further demands

            "content": "Hydroponics has revolutionized gardening and farming by eliminating the need for soil, allowing plants to grow faster, healthier, and more efficiently. At the heart of every successful hydroponic system lies a critical factor: hydroponic nutrients. These nutrient solutions are the life source for plants, replacing the traditional minerals and organic matter found in soil.\n\nUnderstanding hydroponic nutrients  how they work, how to manage them, and how to optimize their use  is key to achieving strong yields and healthy plants. Whether youre just starting with hydroponics or scaling up to a commercial setup, mastering nutrients is a must.\n\nIn hydroponic systems, plants depend entirely on the grower for their nutritional needs. Unlike traditional farming, where soil acts as a buffer and nutrient reservoir, hydroponics delivers nutrients directly through water. This direct delivery means plants absorb essential elements faster and more efficiently, leading to faster growth cycles andbigger harvests.\n\nHydroponic nutrients include a mix of macronutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), along with secondary elements such as calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. Trace minerals like iron, manganese, boron, and zinc are equally vital, supporting photosynthesis, cell structure, and root development.\n\nBy precisely controlling nutrient levels, growers can tailor feeding schedules to each plants growth stage, dramatically improving outcomes.\n\nNot all nutrient solutions are created equal. Some are designed for general use, while others are tailored for specific crops like leafy greens, herbs, or fruiting plants. The choice of nutrients also depends on the type of hydroponic system being used  for instance, deep water culture (DWC) systems often need slightly different nutrient balances than drip irrigation setups.\n\nBeginners often start withpre-formulated hydroponic nutrients, which offer balanced profiles for a range of plants. Advanced growers might customize their own blends to fine-tune nutrient delivery. Monitoring factors like electrical conductivity (EC) and pH ensures that plants are receiving exactly what they need without risking deficiencies or toxicities.\n\nGrowers serious about optimizing their setups often turn to top hydroponic nutrient techniques to maintain peak system performance and avoid common pitfalls.\n\nStarting with hydroponic nutrients can seem overwhelming at first, but it becomes second nature with practice. Beginners should focus on understanding three key aspects: nutrient types, concentration levels, and pH control.\n\nPre-mixed nutrient solutions specifically formulated for beginners offer a reliable starting point. Many are labeled according to plant type or growth stage (vegetative vs flowering), making selection easier. Monitoring pH is equally important, as incorrect levels can lock nutrients out, even if they are present in the solution.\n\nTo simplify the learning curve, new growers can explore guides likehydroponic nutrients for beginners, where step-by-step instructions make it easy to avoid mistakes and build strong foundational skills.\n\nMastering the basics early ensures a smoother, more productive journey into the world of hydroponic gardening.\n\nSuccessful hydroponic gardening doesnt stop at adding nutrients to water; it requires consistent monitoring and adjustments. EC meters and pH testing kits are essential tools for keeping nutrient solutions within the ideal range.\n\nAs plants absorb nutrients and water evaporates, concentrations can fluctuate. Without careful monitoring, plants may face nutrient deficiencies, stunted growth, or salt buildup in the system. Regularly checking solution strength, topping off water levels, and flushing systems, when necessary, ensures a stable environment for roots to thrive.\n\nAutomated nutrient dosing systems are becoming increasingly popular, especially for larger or commercial hydroponic operations. These smart systems help maintain ideal conditions with minimal manual effort.\n\nIncorporating hydroponic nutrient balance strategies into regular garden management improves long-term success and plant vitality.\n\nEven experienced growers can make errors when it comes to nutrients. Overfeeding, underfeeding, or failing to monitor pH can all lead to disappointing harvests. Recognizing the signs of imbalance  such as yellowing leaves, slow growth, or nutrient burn  is critical for quick intervention.\n\nOne useful strategy is implementing a simple feeding chart and adjusting based on plant response rather than blindly following general schedules. Also, regularly cleaning and sterilizing equipment prevents salt buildup and contamination, two often-overlooked nutrient management issues.\n\nHydroponic success isnt about having perfect systems from the start; its about observing plants, learning from each cycle, and refining techniques over time.\n\nTechnology is transforming how growers manage nutrients. Innovations like real-time nutrient monitors, AI-assisted dosing systems, and environmentally friendly nutrient sources are making hydroponic gardening more sustainable and scalable.\n\nAs hydroponic systems become smarter and more automated, the growers role evolves into that of a manager and optimizer. Learning hydroponic nutrient fundamentals today sets gardeners up for long-term success as these technologies become more widespread.\n\nBy understanding and mastering hydroponic nutrients now, growers position themselves at the forefront of a greener, smarter future for agriculture and food production.\n\n",
