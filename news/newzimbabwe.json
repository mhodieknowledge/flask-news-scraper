Tambwera added the extras once again.\n\nCaptain Hilton Mudariki, marking his 51st Test cap, added a third with a trademark dart from close range, converted clinically by Tambwera.\n\nAlthough Zambia struck back with a converted try of their own, the Sables remained in full control. They ran in several more tries before the break, showcasing fluid backline movement and relentless forward pressure. The halftime score stood at 2810, with Zimbabwe firmly in the drivers seat.\n\nThe second half saw the Sables explode into another gear, scoring an avalanche of tries as fatigue and defensive frailties took their toll on the visitors. Zimbabwes depth off the bench maintained the pace, as the scoreline ballooned past 50.\n\nBy the final whistle, Zimbabwe had racked up ten tries in total, with Tambwera converting most of them, including several from difficult angles. Zambia managed one more try in the second half, but it was a mere consolation as the Sables finished the job emphatically at 7015.\n\nAfter the match, captain Mudariki praised the teams effort but acknowledged room for refinement:\n\nSuper happy to have such a great win in front of the home fans. Its good to see all the work we put in translating to the scoreboard.\n\nIt was a good win but we made a lot of errors on the field and had some discipline issues on the park, but these are things we will easily fix.\n\nPlaying at home is always the best, especially when we also get a win. The home fans played a huge role today.\n\nWith a 55-point margin, Zimbabwe takes a massive advantage into the second leg and look well poised to retain their dominance in this regional rivalry.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Nurses Association (ZINA) has called on the government to urgently intervene to solve the crisis facing the health sector, including low salaries, under-staffing, and lack of medical equipment and sundries.\n\nLast month in March, nurses at Sally Mugabe Hospital staged a demonstration protesting against the deteriorating working conditions, including paltry pay, non-availbility of electricity and running water, reflecting the widespread gripe over the poor standards.\n\nIn a statement, the ZINA president, Enock Dongo, said the health sector has been plunged into a crisis as nurses are living below the poverty datum line (PDL).\n\nCurrently, the salary of a nurse remains at a paltry US$240 and an additional amount in ZiG that equates to approximately US$150 an income far below the poverty datum line.\n\nThis situation has rendered our nurses incapable of sending their children to school, buying clothes, affording food, or even securing transport to work. Many are walking long distances to their workstations, while others are forced to live in overcrowded single-room accommodations with their families due to an inability to pay rent. This is not only unacceptable it is pathetic and dehumanising, said Dongo\n\nThe association urged government to urgently review nurses salary to at least $840, a figure reflective of the pre-October 2018 exchange rate.\n\nWe urgently call on the government to review and adjust nurses salaries to a minimum of US$840, a figure that reflects the pre-October 2018 value, when the exchange rate was 1:1.\n\nSuch a revision is critical to alleviating the chronic underpayment and harsh living conditions being endured by our health workers, said Dongo.\n\nHe also indicated the critical shortage of medical equipment and resources in hospitals, which he says has led to public blame directed at nurses for inadequate patient care.\n\nFurthermore, the working conditions in public health institutions are dire. Most hospital buildings are dilapidated and no longer fit for purpose.\n\nThere is a severe lack of medical resources, equipment, and essential drugs. In the absence of these tools, nurses are being unfairly blamed by the public for delays and inefficiencies, Dongo added.\n\nThey are overburdened by improvisation, leading to long queues, slow service delivery, and increased suffering of patients. This also results in heightened exposure to infections and extreme fatigue for the nurses, said Dongo\n\nHe also added that, The chronic shortage of staff is worsening the situation, with the nurse-to-patient ratio as high as 1:20 or even 1:30 in some wards. This is unmanageable and endangers both patient care and nurse wellbeing.\n\nWe demand that the government urgently recruit more staff and consider the reintroduction of locum arrangements, allowing nurses on leave or off-duty to work additional shifts for fair compensation.\n\nFuthermore, ZINA has also raised concerns over the delay in issuing academic credentials to nurses upon completion of their training, affecting over 4,000 nurses, who are unable to secure employment as a result.\n\nWe are also gravely concerned about the violation of nurses rights. It has come to our attention that nurses who have completed their mandatory bonding are being denied their diplomas and verification letters documents that are necessary for them to seek employment, locally or internationally.\n\nThis is a blatant infringement on their right to choose their employer, and we demand immediate release of these documents to all eligible nurses. Over 4,000 nurses are currently affected by this injustice.\n\nAnother pressing issue is the governments unreasonable rental charges for nurses staying in government accommodation. Nurses have been charged up to US$120 per month for basic rooms, and shockingly, these deductions are made from the US dollar component of their salaries, not the ZiG portion, said Dongo.\n\nThe government has also been urged to align with international labour practices.\n\nLastly, we call for alignment with international labor practices for shift work. Nurses often work long, irregular hours and should be entitled to fewer working days per week to reduce fatigue and the risk of occupational exposure to infections. This model in standard practice in many countries and must be adopted here to safeguard both nurses and the patients they serve, said Dongo.\n\n",

            "content": "By IOL News\n\nTHE Western Cape Legislatures Standing Committee on Infrastructure was given a sobering and detailed account of the George building collapse during a live briefing on Friday.\n\nThe Garden Route District Municipality and the George Municipality reflected on the devastating event that claimed lives and injured many more.\n\nThe incident, which occurred just after 2pm on May 6, 2024, saw a multi-storey building under construction on Victoria Street collapse in what responders described as a rare pancake collapse, where floors fall directly atop one another.\n\nSpeaking at the briefing, Head of Disaster Management for the Garden Route District Municipality, Gerard Otto shared the agonising realities of the response operation.\n\nI dont think anything fully prepares you for an incident like this. Having the plan just makes the gap less of what you didnt plan for and what youve got planned.\n\nIt took 260 hours, from 6 to 17 May, for rescue teams to comb through the rubble, searching for survivors among 62 confirmed victims, most of whom were foreign nationals.\n\nOnly 16 of the deceased were South African citizens. The rest were Mozambican, Zimbabwean, Malawian, Lesotho nationals, some undocumented, Otto revealed.\n\nOne of the most remarkable moments came 118 hours into the rescue, when survivor Gabriel Gumba was pulled from the rubble virtually unharmed.\n\nThat lifted the spirit to say, Okay, lets carry on, lets do even more, said Otto.\n\nThe response involved more than a thousand personnel and volunteers, including specialised rescue technicians, emergency medical teams, construction workers, and canine units.\n\nHowever, the operation faced significant logistical and emotional challenges. Response equipment had to be transported from Worcester, resulting in delays of up to five hours for critical tools.\n\nAdditionally, language barriers complicated the provision of psychosocial support for victims, while inaccurate or missing records from contractors made it nearly impossible to track the workers involved.\n\nGeorge Municipality Fire Chief Neels Barnard described the moment he reached the scene.\n\nWas it just a structural collapse of one wall? Or was it the whole building? Its only when you reach the disaster site that you can see what has really happened. Even in the Western Cape, we have never experienced a tragedy of this scale before, said Barnard.\n\nCoordinated through a Multi-Agency Centre (MAC), the operation implemented triage colour-coding, acoustic detection devices, and forensic identification methods including tattoos and social media photos.\n\nNGOs, churches, and the Department of Social Development offered support to grieving families and rescue workers alike.\n\nThis was not just a government response, it was a whole-of-society approach, Otto said.\n\nOfficials also credited past disaster experiences, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2017 Knysna fires, for helping establish functional cluster systems.\n\nEveryone knew their roles, Otto added.\n\nThat intergovernmental coordination saved lives.\n\n",

            "content": "By BBC News\n\nLABORS Anthony Albanese has defied the so-called incumbency curse to be re-elected Australias prime minister in a landslide.\n\nOfficial vote counting wont finish for days, but Albaneses centre-left government will dramatically increase its majority after the conservative Liberal-National coalition suffered a thumping defeat nationwide.\n\nToday, the Australian people have voted for Australian values: for fairness, aspiration and opportunity for all; for the strength to show courage in adversity and kindness to those in need, Albanese said.\n\nCoalition leader Peter Dutton, who lost his own seat of 24 years, said he accepted full responsibility for his partys loss and apologised to his MPs.\n\nFollowing the result, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio both said they looked forward to deepening their bilateral relationships with Australia.\n\nCost-of-living concerns  particularly the affordability of healthcare and housing  dominated the five-week campaign, but international relations also reared its head, with the issue of how to deal with Donald Trump looming large over the election.\n\nDutton was seen by many as Australias Trump, which appeared to go down badly with voters, despite his attempts to shake off comparisons made between his policies on immigration, public sector cuts and China, and the Trump administration.\n\nFormer Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull told BBC Newshour that Dutton ran a very Trumpian campaign, and the US president was the mood music that had a very big influence on how people perceived the Liberal-National opposition.\n\nLabor saw swings towards them right across the country  a rare feat for a second-term government in Australia  and Albanese becomes the first prime minister to win back-to-back elections in over 20 years.\n\nThe partys success has also tempered a trend of voters abandoning the two major parties, which was the big story of the last election in 2022.\n\nLabor is on track to finish with 86 seats, the Coalition about 40, and the Greens Party with one or two, according to projections by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC). Other minor parties and independents are ahead in nine seats.\n\nThat represents an increase of nine for Labor and a significant drop in support for the Greens. However most teal independents have been returned in their more conservative, inner-city electorates.\n\nIts a remarkable turnaround from the start of the year, when polling put Albaneses popularity at record lows after three years of global economic pain, tense national debate, and growing government dissatisfaction.\n\nAlbanese says his election was a vote for equality and kindess\n\nNuclear v renewables: The coal mining town caught in Australias climate wars\n\nIn his Saturday night victory speech, Albanese addressed some of the elections key issues, which also included migration, climate change and energy.\n\nHe reiterated his promises to make healthcare  most critically GP appointments  more affordable, put buying a house in reach for more Australians, and do more to address climate change and protect the environment.\n\nNotably, he also vowed to advance reconciliation for First Nations people: We will be a stronger nation when we Close the Gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.\n\nIts a veiled reference to the biggest moment of Albaneses tenure, the failed Voice referendum of October 2023, which sought to recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in the constitution, and simultaneously establish a parliamentary advisory body for them.\n\nAustralia remains the only Commonwealth country to have never signed a treaty with its Indigenous people.\n\nSoul-searching after emphatic result\n\nThe Voice was one of Albaneses most defining policies, and his most striking setback  it was overwhelmingly rejected after months of often toxic and divisive national debate.\n\nIndigenous Australians have told the BBC they feel like theyve been forgotten by policymakers since.\n\nThe prime minister also found difficulty trying to walk a middle path on the Israel-Gaza war, raised eyebrows after buying a multi-million-dollar beach pad in the midst of a housing crisis and, like other leaders globally, he grappled with tough economic conditions.\n\nWith tanking poll numbers, Albanese was broadly seen as the underdog coming into the election, and was poised to be the next victim of the incumbency curse  a term to explain a global trend where struggling constituents were turfing out governments after a single term.\n\nDutton, on the other hand, looked like he was writing a great political comeback  he was on the edge of bringing his party from its worst loss in 70 years back into office in a single term.\n\nIt has been almost a century since a first-term government has failed to win re-election, but as Australian National University Emeritus Professor John Warhurst said: Dutton entered the campaign [year] in front. It was his to lose.\n\nInstead, Dutton has overseen a party loss so emphatic he has lost his own electorate of Dickson, to Labors Ali France.\n\nI love this country and have fought hard for it, he told supporters in Brisbane, conceding defeat.\n\nWe have been defined by our opponents in this election which is not a true story of who we are, but we will rebuild from here and we will do that because we know our values, we know our beliefs, and we will always stick to them.\n\nHis campaign was marred by unforced errors: including a series of policy backflips which caused confusion, awkward mistakes on important issues like cost of living and, perhaps most memorably, accidentally booting an AFL ball into a cameramans head.\n\nThe opposition has been shambolic, Prof Warhurst says.\n\nBut the government  while resolute and disciplined in its campaign  was timid. Its strategy was largely allowing voters to judge Dutton and his party, rather than advancing bold or convincing policies, analysts say.\n\nAnd thats something we heard from voters throughout the campaign too.\n\nWhile the Coalition turns to licking its wounds and choosing its next leader, it will again have to reckon with its direction.\n\nLast election, analysts and some of the partys own MPs cautioned against a move towards the right. They questioned whether Dutton  a polarising figure considered by many to be a conservative hard man  was the right person to rebuild support, particularly in the moderate areas where they lost a lot of it.\n\nAfter a campaign which in its dying days ventured into culture war territory and what some say are Trumpian politics, the Coalition is going to have to ask those questions again  and if they want to be competitive, perhaps find different answers.\n\nWe have to stop drinking the Kool-Aid from the fire hose and we need to have a serious review we delude ourselves that we are just a few tactical devices away from winning an election, former Liberal strategist Tony Barry told the ABC.\n\nBut meanwhile Labor has to decide what it wants to achieve with the large mandate Australia has handed them.\n\nAlbaneses incumbency curse turned out to be a gift, with international uncertainty appearing to have swayed voters in countries like Canada away from change. Likewise, Australia voted for stability.\n\nLabor struck a middle-of-the-road path with its a policy platform, but can now afford to be braver, says Amy Remeikis, chief politicial analyst at the Australia Institute think tank.\n\nThat was the path that they took to the election, and that is what they are seeing has paid dividends for them. But the question now is: Will Labor actually do something with power?'\n\n",
