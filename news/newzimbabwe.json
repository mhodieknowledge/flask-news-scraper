Such behaviour has no place in society and media specifically, where voices should uplift, not degrade. Moja Love (DStv 157) as a platform is committed to fostering a respectful and inclusive environment. We refuse to stay silent.\n\nMisogyny on air doesnt only harm the individuals targeted, it perpetuates a toxic culture that normalises the dehumanisation of women. Yesterday we took a firm stance against this conduct, and we will continue to challenge such rhetoric whenever it arises. Media is designed to shape societal norms, and with that influence comes responsibility. To MacG and others who use their platforms carelessly: accountability is not optional. We urge audiences and broadcasters alike to reject sexist vitriol and demand better. Respect isnt a privilege, its a right.\n\nThe channel has also received flack for airing a recent episode of the reality showIsencane Lengane.\n\nThe show, in its seventh season, which follows the lives of Siyacela Dlamuka and Thando Msomi, who married when they were teenagers,sparked outrage among viewers, with many raising concerns about the couples toxicity.\n\nAccording to Moja Love,Isencane Lenganeis designed to contribute to the discourse on gender-based violence and societal ills, with the aim of raising awareness and promoting positive change.\n\nMoja Love said they are committed to providing psychological support to affected members, including Thando, who was affected by events depicted in the show, and would continue to offer support.\n\nIt is important to note the show is a reality show which reflects, explores and raises awareness and contributes to the discourse on gender-based violence and societal ills. The channel has through many of its social justice programmes played a pivotal role in shaping discourse and contributing positively in society, read thestatement.\n\n",

In the foreign exchange markets, the local currency marginally lost 3.75% year-to-date against the US dollar to close March 2025 at a rate of ZWG26.77 to the Dollar, she said.\n\nDuring the period under review, the Group delivered strong financial results, reflected in a profit after tax of ZWG537.53 million, from a total income of ZWG1.41 billion, a testament to its financial position strength and capitalisation, reinforced by a substantial market presence in deposit mobilisation and transactional volumes.\n\nThe groups top-line performance was underpinned by a solid contribution from funded income at ZWG486.24 million, while non-funded income at ZWG938.03 million delivered particularly strong results for the quarter.\n\nCBZs asset base closed the quarter at ZWG 38.75 billion, supported by a deposit base of ZWG26.79 billion, with a performance which provides a foundation and sets the tone for the remainder of the financial year, highlighting our commitment to delivering sustainable value to all stakeholders.\n\n",

She would contact potential victims, sometimes through intermediaries, offering the opportunity for enrollment in training programs.\n\nIn one instance, she contacted a prophetess claiming to be grateful for past prayers and used this connection to offer the fraudulent training opportunity. The offender would then request money from the victims, purportedly for training expenses, accommodation, and uniforms.\n\nThese payments were made through various money transfer methods such as Mojomula, Innbucks, Mukuru, and Ecocash, said the prosecution.\n\nFurthermore, Magazini would promise the victims that their names would be published in state-run newspapers for confirmation of enrollment.\n\nThe offender received the money from the complainants. In some cases, intermediaries were used to collect and consolidate payments from multiple individuals. To maintain the deception, the accused would make false promises, such as claiming that the victims names would be published in official publications like the Herald and Sunday Mail.\n\nWhen victims began to question the legitimacy of the scheme, the offender would make excuses and provide false reassurances. The scheme was carried out over a period of time, with different counts relating to different groups of victims and timeframes.\n\nMagazini got a 10-year suspension on the condition of good behaviour and restitution, and will only serve 2 years in prison.\n\n",

No officers have been charged.\n\nOn Monday, following the release of the BBC Africa Eye documentary, the IPOA gave an update on the investigations.\n\nThe authority revealed that so far, of the 60 deaths under investigation, 41 involved gunshot wounds.\n\nThe IPOA said it had completed 22 investigations, while it was actively pursuing 36, and that two cases were currently before the courts.\n\nThe investigating agency said it had recorded 233 injury cases during the demonstrations.\n\nIn a statement, the main opposition coalition said the execution of peaceful protesters was premeditated and sanctioned at the highest levels.\n\nMr Mwaura said the documentary risked inciting Kenyans to violence while one legislator called for the BBC to be banned in Kenya.\n\nGeorge Peter Kaluma, said that the 37-minute-long documentary risked destabilising the country.\n\nBut a senator, Edwin Sifuna, defended the documentary saying there were no fabrications in it.\n\nWe must encourage these stories to be told from all angles for the sake of truth and justice. Those who are uncomfortable with this are wrestling with their own consciences and we cannot help them with that, Sifuna posted on X.\n\n",

This recovery is expected to have downstream benefits for the other sectors in the economy. In addition, a stable exchange rate, low inflation, as well as favourable international commodity prices for key minerals are expected to provide a conducive environment for doing business, he said.\n\nThe Groups turnover for the year was US$231.6 million, which is 11% below the previous year. Despite slightly improved demand in the second half, Turnall experienced unavailability of foreign currency for the importation of raw materials, high power outages and fuel shortages.\n\nTurnall intends to implement technical cooperation initiatives aimed at improving product quality and productivity. Export turnover improved to $10.5 million, contributing 5% of turnover from 1.2% in the previous year. This was attributed to the Groups export strategy that resulted in enhanced presence in the regional markets.\n\n",
