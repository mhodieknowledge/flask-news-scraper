            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nFormer Zimbabwe Under-18 rugby player Campbell Nyakudya has been dragged to court amid allegations that he drugged, raped and robbed a 25-year-old woman after a night out in Harare.\n\nNyakudya, once celebrated for his explosive pace on the rugby field, appeared before Harare magistrate Marewanazvo Gofa, facing rape and theft charges. He was not asked to plead and was released on US$200 bail pending trial.\n\nAccording to the State, the incident occurred on October 25 when the complainant, a socialite, was having drinks with friends at La Parada Restaurant before they later moved to Karma Night Club in the capital.\n\nProsecutors said while at the club, the complainant went to the bathroom and, on her return, found her friends had left. Nyakudya was reportedly standing at the table with another woman.\n\nShe then picked up her glass and continued drinking while looking for her friends, the State outline reads. From that moment, the complainant could not remember what happened next and only woke up at Chisipite shops covered with a cloth.\n\nAccording to the court papers, bystanders at Chisipite told her she had been dumped by a moving vehicle, but they were unable to capture the cars registration number as it sped away.\n\nShe later realised that her handbag, an iPhone 14 Pro Max, US$1,200 cash, and wig were missing. She filed a police report at ZRP Highlands, leading investigators back to La Parada where they reviewed the clubs CCTV footage.\n\nThe footage showed the accused person adding an unknown substance into the complainants drink, the State said. It also captured him and an unidentified woman escorting the complainant to his vehicle before driving off.\n\nThe prosecution further alleged that Nyakudya later dumped the unconscious complainant at a parking area near Chisipite Shopping Centre.\n\nWhen workers from Karma Night Club took her home, she started to feel some pain in her private parts, prosecutors said.\n\nNyakudya was arrested on October 28, and according to the case outline, he admitted to having sexual intercourse with the complainant once without her consent.\n\nThe State insists the accused acted unlawfully.\n\nThe matter was remanded to a later date pending trial.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nThe Trump administration will limit the number of refugees admitted to the US to 7,500 over the next year, and give priority to white South Africans.\n\nThe move, announced in a notice published on Thursday, marks a dramatic cut from the previous limit of 125,000 set by former President Joe Biden and will bring the cap to a record low.\n\nNo reason was given for the cut, but the notice said it was justified by humanitarian concerns or is otherwise in the national interest.\n\nIn January, Trump signed an executive order suspending the US Refugee Admissions Programme, or USRAP, which he said would allow US authorities to prioritise national security and public safety.\n\nThe previous lowest refugee admissions cap was set by the first Trump administration in 2020, when it allocated 15,000 spots for fiscal year 2021.\n\nThe notice posted to the website of the Federal Register said the 7,500 admissions would primarily be allocated to Afrikaner South Africans and other victims of illegal or unjust discrimination in their respective homelands.\n\nIn February, the US president announced the suspension of critical aid to South Africa and offered to allow members of the Afrikaner community  who are mostly white descendants of early Dutch and French settlers  to settle in the US as refugees.\n\nSouth Africas ambassador to Washington, Ebrahim Rasool, was later expelled after accusing Trump of mobilising a supremacism and trying to project white victimhood as a dog whistle.\n\nIn the Oval Office in May, Trump confronted South Africas President Cyril Ramaphosa and claimed white farmers in his nation were being killed and persecuted.\n\nThe White House also played a video which they said showed burial sites for murdered white farmers. It later emerged that the videos were scenes from a 2020 protest in which the crosses represented farmers killed over multiple years.\n\nThe tense meeting came just days after the US granted asylum to 60 Afrikaners.\n\nThe South African government has vehemently denied that Afrikaners and other White South Africans are being persecuted.\n\nOn his first day in office on 20 January, Trump said the US would suspend USRAP to reflect the USs lack of ability to absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees, into its communities in a manner that does not compromise the availability of resources for Americans and protects their safety and security.\n\nThe US policy of accepting white South Africans has already prompted accusations of unfair treatment from refugee advocacy groups.\n\nSome have argued the US is now effectively shut to other persecuted groups or people facing potential harm in their home country, and even former allies that helped US forces in Afghanistan or the Middle East.\n\nThis decision doesnt just lower the refugee admissions ceiling, Global Refuge CEO and president Krish OMara Vignarajah said on Thursday. It lowers our moral standing.\n\nAt a time of crisis in countries ranging from Afghanistan to Venezuela to Sudan and beyond, concentrating the vast majority of admissions on one group undermines the programmes purpose as well as its credibility, she added.\n\nRefugees International also slammed the move, saying it makes a mockery of refugee protection and of American values.\n\nLet us be frank: whatever hardships some Afrikaners may face, this population has no plausible claim on refugee status  they are not fleeing systematic persecution, Refugees International said in its statement.\n\nThe South African government has yet to respond to the latest announcement.\n\nDuring the Oval Office meeting, President Ramaphosa said only that he hoped that Trump officials would listen to South Africans about the issue, and later said he believed there is doubt and disbelief about all this in [Trumps] head.\n\nEarlier this year, Ramaphosa signed a controversial law allowing the government to seize privately-owned land without compensation in some circumstances.\n\nWhile the country does not release race-based crime figured, figures published earlier this year showed that 7,000 people were murdered in South African between October and December 2024.\n\nOf these, 12 were killed in farm attacks and only one of the 12 was a farmer. Five others were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nNATIONAL Tyre Services (NTS) has tabled plans to delist from the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) due to insignificant returns prompted by a tough economic environment and the influx of cheaper imports.\n\nIn a Circular to shareholders published this week, NTS said after a comprehensive review of the companys listing requirements, it was agreed that the benefits of maintaining the listing status no longer pay off as was the case in the previous years.\n\nThe company, which has been on the ZSE listing since 1969, is now seeking shareholder approval to green-light the move.\n\nThe operating environment has, however, been characterised by persistent macroeconomic instability over the past decades. The business has been adversely affected by severe exchange rate volatility, liquidity constraints and shortages of foreign currency, all of which have materially hindered the importation of tyres and raw materials, the company said.\n\nThe Zimbabwean tyre industry has, in recent years, experienced heightened competition due to low entry barriers and the influx of imported brands, resulting in a loss of market share for the company said limited access to long-term and affordable capital has also constrained the companys ability to execute its expansion strategy and maintain adequate working capital levels.\n\nDespite numerous efforts to secure funding through the local banking system, borrowing has remained prohibitively expensive. Operationally, NTS continues to face significant challenges, such as power supply deficits have disrupted production at the retreading factory, where capacity utilisation has averaged approximately 30%.\n\nIn conjunction with the proposed delisting, major shareholder Radun Investments (Private) Limited is extending a mandatory offer to acquire all shares held by minority shareholders. The offer is for a cash consideration of US$0.0248 per share. This provides a clear and structured opportunity for minority shareholders to exit their investment at a price deemed fair and reasonable by Independent Financial Advisors, said NTS.\n\nThe total indicative share trading liquidity for National Tyre Services Limited (NTS.zw) in the past 12 months, as of 1st October 2025, is US$1.06million (ZWG28.41million). An average of US$88,170 (ZWG2.37 million) per month.\n\n",

The mission aimed to discuss concerns over the escalating crackdown on dissent under what the coalition called the increasingly authoritarian regime which has also shut down the internet.\n\nUpon arrival, Vavas passport was reportedly confiscated by immigration officials, who subjected him to hours of interrogation and profiling in restricted airport rooms. He was later informed that he was not welcome in Tanzania and labelled a security risk-without any formal explanation.\n\nThe coalition said Vava spent the night detained in a holding cell at the airport without blankets before being deported on 29 October.\n\nTanzanian officials have remained mum on the incident.\n\n",
