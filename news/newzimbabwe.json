What I request is that the Hon. Member should bring the paperwork which talks about the prevalence of homicide cases.\n\nIf we respond to such a question without evidence that this is happening, this is an issue which does not augur well, said Ziyambi.\n\nIn recent months, the country has been witnessing murder cases related to gun violence. They have been attributed to the proliferation and ownership of guns by individuals.\n\nIn May this year, the Zimbabwe Republic Police raised concern about the increase in illegal firearms, which is in contravention of the Firearms Act Chapter 10.09.\n\nZiyambi further said the government does not tolerate homicide cases.\n\nGovernment does not want to see homicide cases happening because it is a criminal offence. It is one offence which had a capital punishment life in jail. In the past, it used a death sentence which was given to an offender.\n\nSo, when we look at the issues to do with homicide, you would find that when criminals hear that there are punitive penalties that have been given to perpetrators of homicide, then this would discourage others.\n\nI want to urge the Hon. Member to put in writing his question so that we get clarity and that we also clarify, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nEcoCash, Zimbabwes largest financial technology platform, says it is stepping up efforts to increase international remittance receipts by partnering with more global payment platforms.\n\nThe mobile money service, owned by Econet Wireless Zimbabwe, already partners with leading global remittance providers such as Sasai Money Transfer, Western Union, WorldRemit, MamaMoney, MoneyGram, Remitly, Shoprite Send and Terrapay.\n\nEcoCash currently has over 40 partners integrating into mobile wallets. The company revealed that it is currently in talks with additional international partners as part of its long-term strategy to build a truly global payments ecosystem.\n\nEfforts to onboard more payment partners are ongoing as we aim to establish a global platform that prioritises convenience, affordability and value for customers, EcoCash said last week at the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Zimbabwe (ICAZ) Winter School 2025 and Investment Conference in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe high-profile gathering is positioning Zimbabwe as an emerging investment hub and showcasing the countrys deal pipeline, growth-ready sectors and capital opportunities.\n\nIt is also connecting institutional investors, global financiers and the diaspora with pathways to channel funds into productive ventures.\n\nThe initiative by EcoCash comes at a time when remittances are increasingly playing a vital role in Zimbabwes economy.\n\nAccording to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), diaspora remittances surpassed US$2 billion in 2024, making them one of the countrys largest and most stable sources of foreign currency.\n\nAnalysts say EcoCashs expanded global footprint is timely and strategic, enabling millions of Zimbabweans abroad to send money home faster, more securely, and at a lower cost. EcoCash zero-rates all remittance withdrawals  or cash-outs  from its wallets. It has an extensive distribution network of over 60,000 merchants and channel partners across the countrys rural and urban areas.\n\nIn 2024, EcoCash recorded a 21% growth in transaction volumes and a 210% surge in transaction values, driven by increased wallet funding and growing customer adoption.\n\nThe growth reflects consumer trust in the mobile money platform and the increasing importance of digital channels in cross-border money transfers.\n\nBeyond household support for essentials  such as food, school fees, healthcare, and housing  remittances are increasingly powering small business growth and community development projects, EcoCash said, noting that reliable and affordable digital payment services are enabling both rural and urban recipients to transact, save and invest without relying on costly cash-based methods.\n\nIndustry experts observe that strengthening formal remittance channels curb dependence on informal networks, improves financial inclusion and enhances consumer protection.\n\nWith Zimbabwes diaspora spread across South Africa, the UK, the US, Australia and beyond, EcoCashs expansion of its partner network offers more convenience and consolidates its market leadership in the mobile money space.\n\nAs we expand, our mission remains clear  to empower Zimbabweans abroad to conveniently support their loved ones with ease, while ensuring that recipients at home enjoy safe, transparent and seamless access to funds for both their everyday needs and future investments.\n\nRemitHope  a fintech-powered social enterprise that mobilises financial support for underfunded African-led community initiatives and leverages EcoCash to channel remittances into Africa to close the funding gaps  also participated at the ICAZ Winter School 2025 and Investment Conference in the UK.\n\n",

A legend and a heartbreak emoji.\n\nBritish designer Paul Smith also spoke about his dear friend and fellow designer.\n\nHis continuity, his down-to-earth nature and his staying power in remaining as an unlisted, independent company have always been a huge inspiration for me personally,Smith wrote on social media.\n\nHe has been an enormous source of strength and creativity for many years.\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni also paid tribute, saying: With his elegance, sobriety, and creativity, he was able to bring lustre to Italian fashion and inspire the entire world.\n\nAn icon, a tireless worker, a symbol of the best of Italy. Thank you for everything.\n\nIn a profile in The Financial Times, in one of the designers last interviews, Alexander Fury wrote: He put women into a uniform of suits just as radical as Chanels, creating forceful, confident clothing that helped to power the working womans social revolution of the 1980s.\n\nBy contrast, he relaxed menswear, deconstructing traditional tailoring in a manner that has affected how just about every suit in the world is made.\n\nA friend of Hollywood, he understood the power of publicity and dressed some of its biggest stars for the red carpet including for the Oscars  including Zendaya, Cate Blanchett and Julia Roberts.\n\nHe also designed stage outfits for Lady Gaga and various costumes for films American Gigolo and The Wolf of Wall Street.\n\nEven as he entered his 10th decade, Armani continued to present new collections on the French and Italian catwalks.\n\nHis March 2025 show was designed to make a statement on global politics, with him stating that he wanted to imagine new harmony as he believed that is what we all need.\n\nConcern over his health was first expressed in June this year, when he missed Milan fashion week.\n\nHe directed a couture show in Paris in July 2025, but did this remotely from his home in Milan.\n\nArmani was described as a true gentleman and titan of the industry by Vogues Laura Ingham, who paid tribute to the late designer.\n\nShe added: If you dont know anything about fashion, youll still know Giorgio Armani. Mr. Armani built a house synonymous with timeless Italian elegance and enduring style.\n\nReferencing his classic style, which included refined silhouettes and immaculate tailoring, she concluded that his legacy is woven not only into fashions past and present but will continue to shape its future for generations to come.\n\nStarting his career in medicine, he moved to fashion in the 1960s and set up his own luxury label in 1975 alongside his late partner Sergio Galeotti.\n\nHe faced much criticism during his career, including in 2015 when he said a gay man does not need to dress homosexual.\n\nHis company also reached a financial settlement with Italian tax authorities over offshore subsidiaries in 2014, though no wrongdoing was admitted.\n\nAway from fashion, he was a keen sports fan and supported Serie A football team Inter Milan and owned the Olimpia Milano basketball team.\n\nThe fashion brand also had a partnership with the Scuderia Ferrari F1 team, with one of their drivers, Charles Leclercwriting on Instagramthat it was a great honour to have had the chance to meet and work with such an amazing person.\n\nArmani was also presented with the French Legion of Honour and Italian Order of Merit for Labour for his work in fashion.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nAT the heart of Westprops most ambitious urban development, Pomona City, a quiet revolution is underway  one that does not just build homes, but redefines how cities breathe, grow, and sustain themselves. At the centre of this transformation stands a $1 million biodigester facility, a bold move that signals a new era of infrastructure-led community building.\n\nThe Pomona City project, the brainchild of chief executive Mr Ken Sharpe, is not just a real estate project but a philosophy. Designed as a self-contained enclave where residents can live, work, shop, and play, the development is anchored in the belief that modern urban life must be both convenient and ecologically responsible. WestProps investment in wastewater treatment is a testament to that vision.\n\nWith the capacity to treat up to 6 million litres of wastewater daily, the biodigester facility is more than a utility  it is a statement. It ensures that Pomona Citys growth does not come at the expense of the environment, and that sustainability is not an afterthought but a foundational principle.\n\nIn a city where urban sprawl often outpaces infrastructure, WestProps decision to prioritize wastewater management is both rare and radical. The biodigesters not only reduce environmental strain but also support long-term health, hygiene, and resilience for thousands of future residents.\n\nThis is not just about pipes and pumps  it is about dignity and creating a city where families do not have to worry about sanitation, where businesses can thrive without infrastructure bottlenecks, and where urban planning meets global benchmarks.\n\nThe biodigester system also opens the door to circular resource use. Treated water can be repurposed for landscaping, construction, or even watering the Pomona City orchard use within the developmentturning waste into opportunity and reinforcing Pomona Citys ethos of regenerative living.\n\nObservers have begun noting that Westprop has consistently pushed the boundaries of what is possible in Zimbabwean real estate. From smart city ambitions to green infrastructure.\n\nPomona City is a living portfolio of innovation. The biodigester facility is just one chapter in a larger storyone where urban evolution meets strategic foresight.\n\n",
