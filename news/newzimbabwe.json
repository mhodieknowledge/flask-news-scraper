            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nA Harare man, Mike Mupinga (40), was arrested by the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) and charged with culpable homicide after his pit bull mauled a man to death.\n\nThe incident took place Sunday morning in New Bluffhill, Harare, Ward 41.\n\nIn a statement posted on X today, the police confirmed that Mupinga, who is currently in custody, faces charges of culpable homicide.\n\nZRP Mabelreign arrested Mike Mupinga (40) in connection with a case of culpable homicide which occurred at the suspects residence in Mabelreign. The case stems from an incident where his pit-bull dogs allegedly attacked and mauled Samuel Machara (39) to death, the police said.\n\nMacharas body has been taken to Parirenyatwa Hospital for a postmortem examination.\n\nThe body of the victim was found near the suspects residence with dog bite wounds. The body was referred to the Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals mortuary for postmortem, added the police.\n\nWard 41 Councillor Kudzai Kadzombe emphasised that dog owners must keep their animals within their property, and that allowing dogs to roam freely is a clear breach of by-laws.\n\nKadzombe also pointed out that keeping more than two dogs in New Bluffhill and surrounding suburbs contravenes local regulations and could lead to imprisonment of up to six months.\n\nOwners are required to secure their properties with proper fencing or gates to prevent dogs from straying. Always keep dogs on a leash or under control when outside the property.\n\nProperties under 2,000 square metres (e.g., Warren Park, Westlea, Cranborne, Mabelreign, Arcadia, Mabvuku, Avondale): Maximum of 2 dogs.\n\nProperties 2,000 square metres or larger (e.g., Greystone Park, Shawasha Hills, Gletwin Park): Maximum of 4 dogs. Violating these regulations can result in a level three fine, imprisonment for up to six months, or both, she said.\n\nMupinga reportedly kept four dogs at his residence: two pit bulls, one Rottweiler, and an Angaran Mastiff.\n\n",

            "content": "By Xinhua\n\nCHINESE language learners in Zimbabwe on Friday showcased their language skills during the 24th Chinese Bridge competition organized by the Confucius Institute at the University of Zimbabwe in Harare, the countrys capital.\n\nDrawing participants from primary schools, high schools, and colleges, the competition consisted of a speech in Chinese and a talent show.Kudakwashe Makoni, a student of political science and diplomacy at the University of Zimbabwe, stood out with his grasp of the Chinese language and knowledge of Chinese culture.He told Xinhua that the Chinese language serves not only as a practical skill to learn in a globalized world, but also as a bridge between the two countries.Learning Chinese provides huge opportunities for Zimbabweans. You can get scholarships to study in China, and also, with the rapidly growing Chinese economy, there is an opportunity for trade, so we can leverage the opportunity to create an amicable relationship between Zimbabwe and China, he said.Thandeka Risinamhodzi, a high school student from Harare, was elated to be crowned the champion in the high school students segment.Chinese is a very exciting language that you can learn. Learning Chinese benefits in many ways, like in Zimbabwe, most things involve the Chinese, like job opportunities, she said.Makoni and Risinamhodzi will represent Zimbabwe at the international finals of the Chinese Bridge competition in China later this year.In his address to the contest, Attwell Mamvuto, pro-vice-chancellor for academic affairs and administration at the University of Zimbabwe, said the competition not only celebrates linguistic excellence, but also marks the enduring friendship and cooperation between the two countries.Learning a new language opens doors to new opportunities, fosters understanding, and builds bridges between people from different backgrounds.

Built at a cost of US$88m, the interchange is a shoddy, vulgar sobriquet of raw looting and grandiose theft of public funds, Biti wrote on his X account Saturday.\n\nThe US$88m is way out of line with comparative regional projects that have cost significantly less. For instance, SAs Mount Edgecombe project, the biggest in Africa which cost US$70 million.\n\nThe former Treasury chief also labelled Mnangagwas government as a mafia group, which bypassed tender processes and awarded the contract to build such a huge project to Mnangagwas alleged cronies.\n\nThe project was not subject to international tender but instead was awarded to a local cartel and its associates, that has been at the centre of massive looting of public coffers since 2017.\n\nThe cartel has been the biggest recipient of all Treasury Bills issued in this country and has been active in Command Agriculture, mining, fuel, banking, financial services, buses, roads, hospitals, retail and general procurement, he said.\n\nBiti called on Parliament to carry out a forensic audit to establish how the project was funded, saying the entire financing process has been opaque, contrary to Public Finance Management principles, which emphasise on transparency and accountability.\n\nThese questions arise because of the predatory veil of opaqueness that has been the MO (modus operandi) of the regime. Parliament must cause a forensic audit of this project and examining legal financial & engineering constructs of this pagoda. Corruption must stop.\n\nMeanwhile, the public, through social media, has voiced concerns regarding the project and expressed shock that it cost US$88 million, attacking Mnangagwa and his government as corrupt leaders.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nEXILED former Information minister Jonathan Moyo himself once an architect of draconian media laws has conceded that the latest legislation requiring motorists to pay a Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) licence fee before acquiring road authority and insurance fees was not in sync with technological advancements.\n\nThis is despite the illegality of the entire law, which is based on its discriminatory nature.\n\nMoyo, who fled Zimbabwe in 2017 at the height of the military coup that removed former President Robert Mugabe from power and subsequently saw President Emmerson Mnangagwa rise to leadership two weeks later after being dismissed as Vice President by Mugabe, launched a scathing attack on Mnangagwa.\n\nSince the Broadcasting Services Act (BSA) Amendment Bill was signed into law earlier this week, Zimbabweans have expressed widespread dissatisfaction with the new legislation, particularly clause 15, which mandates that motorists must pay the ZBC licence fee  without which they cannot purchase their ZINARA vehicle licence and insurance.\n\nMoyo, who had grown cautious about openly attacking Mnangagwa on platforms like X and in interviews with regional and international news organisations over the past two years, has now waded back into the debate around the ZBC licence fee for motorists.\n\nBasically, the revolution in digital technologies has outdated car radio licences, which is why they have been vacated worldwide, Moyo wrote on X on Friday.\n\nHe added that Mnangagwas government still has an opportunity to repeal the new law, as it is outdated and has been overtaken by technological progress.\n\nIn this connection, the Second Republic had, and still has, an opportunity to repeal the 2001 car radio fee as an outdated, no longer necessary, inconvenient, now unreasonable, and unfair tax burden, Moyo said.\n\nHe further commented: The challenge for a broadcasting licence fee nowadays is how to structure it, perhaps as a tax, taking into account the rapid and massive technological and social transformation taking place.\n\nMoyo implored Mnangagwa to hit the brakes on implementing the controversial law, arguing it must be revised through a digital lens.\n\nIt would be in both the public and national interest to pause the implementation of the car radio licence in order not only to rethink it; but to also review the very idea of a radio and television licence in a digital world; with a view to coming up with a more suitable and modernised, user-friendly, alternative model of a single and comprehensive broadcasting licence fee model, he said.\n\n",
