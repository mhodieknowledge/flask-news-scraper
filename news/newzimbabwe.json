            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nUKRAINIAN political analyst and journalist Peter Zalmayev has suggested that Zimbabwe and neighbouring South Africa present themselves as mediators to end the war between his country and superpower Russia.\n\nZalmayev, who is on a global tour to highlight implications of the war on Ukraine and other smaller countries, was recently in Zimbabwe, having already visited South Africa, eSwatini, Lesotho and some Pacific states.\n\nNamed the Russo-Ukrainian War, the ongoing crisis began in February 2014 when Russia annexed Crimea from Ukraine.\n\nThe war escalated in 2022 when Russia launched a full-scale invasion of its smaller neighbouring country, leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths and a massive refugee crisis.\n\nSpeaking to this publication in an exclusive interview, Zalmayev said the fact that Russia and Zimbabwe shared a lot of history and that President Emmerson Mnangagwa is assured of an ear in Moscow puts the country in an important position to help end the war.\n\nRussia actively took part in the training, clothing and arming of liberation movements in Zimbabwes fight for independence.\n\nSouth Africa, according to Zalmayev, offers another angle to potential mediation by virtue of being part of the BRICS union. BRICS, an acronym for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, is an amalgamation of emerging markets.\n\nIt is these ties which make Zimbabwe and South Africa, which is in BRICS with Russia, very important interlocutors, said Zalmayev.\n\nHarare is on speaking terms with Moscow and my position is that it is best placed to reach out to Ukraine as well and suggest itself as a potential platform for negotiations to end the war.\n\nZimbabwe had been purchasing grain in Ukraine before the war broke out. Zimbabweans are also, in a way, feeling the effects of this war.\n\nIn 2022, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa led a nine-member Africa Union (AU) delegation to Moscow and Kyiv to understand and help mediate. Although they were received by both Russian President Vladimir Putin and Ukraines Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the war continued.\n\nA study by the World Bank, United Nations (UN) and European Union (EU) earlier this year predicted that US$542 billion is needed to reconstruct Ukraine in the next ten years following Russias intensive bombardments in the past three years.\n\nAdded Zalmayev: No one wins in this war. It violates the basic UN principle of sovereignty and infallibility of borders. It is in the interest of smaller countries that Ukraine is allowed to continue existing as an independent state.\n\nIf it falls, it will create a huge precedent wherein bigger countries can walk over and take over the smaller ones.\n\nBefore the escalation of the conflict, Ukraine was one of Zimbabwe and other countries in the regions main sources of wheat and alternative grain imports.\n\n",

            "content": "Anglican Ink\n\nZimbabwes Supreme Court has upheld the enforcement of a United Kingdom divorce order involving the former Bishop of Manicaland, the Rt. Rev. Julius Makoniaffirming the authority of English court rulings over matrimonial property under Zimbabwean law.\n\nBishop Makoni, a former investment banker who became a leading figure in Zimbabwes Anglican hierarchy, resigned his post in 2015 to take a position with the International Monetary Fund. A decade later, he has found himself embroiled in a transnational legal dispute with his ex-wife, Pauline Mutsa Makoni, over matrimonial property in London and Harare.\n\nBishop Makoni, who served as the Diocesan bishop of Manicaland from 2009 to 2015, was one of the key figures in the restoration of the Anglican Diocese in the wake of the contentious Nolbert Kunonga schism. His years as bishop were marked by efforts to rebuild the spiritual and administrative health of a diocese ravaged by ecclesiastical division and state interference.\n\nBut his personal life made headlines after he and his wife divorced in the UK, where they had legal residency. The English High Court finalized their divorce in December 2014 and awarded Mrs. Makoni substantial financial compensation, including the couples marital home in Harare.\n\nWhen Mrs. Makoni sought to have the English orders recognized and enforced in Zimbabwe, Bishop Makoni objectedarguing that the UK ruling was inconsistent with Zimbabwes laws and public policy, particularly when it came to property distribution. He contended that Zimbabwean courts should not recognize foreign judgments that conferred domestic property to a foreign-domiciled spouse.\n\nBut in a landmark decision handed down last week, Zimbabwes Supreme Court dismissed Bishop Makonis objections. The bench held that foreign divorce judgmentsespecially those issued by superior courts in jurisdictions such as the UKare enforceable in Zimbabwe, provided due process was followed and the ruling does not offend local public policy.\n\nThe ruling clarified that even where Zimbabwean courts may have ruled differently in terms of asset division, they are bound by the principle of international comity and legal reciprocity to acknowledge the authority of foreign courtsparticularly where both parties were properly represented.\n\nThis decision sets a precedent in Zimbabwean jurisprudence, specifically regarding cross-border matrimonial disputes, at a time when an increasing number of Zimbabweans reside or hold assets abroad but maintain ties to their home country.\n\nThe case carries allegorical weight for the Zimbabwean church. Just as provinces throughout the Global South have historically resisted directives from England on matters of doctrine, the question posed before Zimbabwes courts was whether English authority could shape realities on Zimbabwean soil.\n\nIronically, the courts decision stands in contrast with the ecclesiastical trend: while Zimbabwean bishops and church bodies have increasingly asserted independence from Canterbury in matters of theology and liturgy, here the state court has chosen deference to English legal authority.\n\nThe case also raises difficult questions for Church leaders involved in civil litigationparticularly when it relates to personal conduct and stewardship of property. While clergy and bishops are often held to high standards within the Churchs pastoral framework, many also own assets or reside across multiple jurisdictions. More importantly, it sends a message to Church leaders, lay or ordained, that positions of ecclesiastical authority do not confer immunity in the courts of law.\n\nThe juxtaposition of Bishop Makonis spiritual authority and his civil defeat may be uncomfortable for some within the Anglican establishment. For others, it demonstrates the maturing of Zimbabwes judiciaryholding sacred and secular spheres in check while respecting the rule of law across borders.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nThe UK has revealed details of its plans to cut foreign aid, with support for childrens education and womens health in Africa facing the biggest reductions.\n\nThe UK government said in February it would slash foreign aid spending by 40%  from 0.5% of gross national income to 0.3%  to increase defence spending to 2.5% after pressure from the US.\n\nA Foreign Office report and impact assessment show the biggest cuts this year will come in Africa, with less spent on womens health and water sanitation with increased risks, it says, of disease and death.\n\nAid charities have criticised the move, saying the cuts would impact the worlds most vulnerable people.\n\nBut the government said spending on multilateral aid bodies  money given to international organisations like the World Bank  would be protected, including the Gavi vaccine alliance, and it said the UK would also continue to play a key humanitarian role in hotspots such as Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan.\n\nBaroness Chapman, minister for development, said: Every pound must work harder for UK taxpayers and the people we help around the world and these figures show how we are starting to do just that through having a clear focus and priorities.\n\nThe government said the cuts follow a line-by-line strategic review of aid by the minister, which focused on prioritisation, efficiency, protecting planned humanitarian support and live contracts while ensuring responsible exit from programming where necessary.\n\nThe Foreign Office said bilateral support  aid going directly to the recipient country  for some countries would decrease and multilateral organisations deemed to be underperforming would face future funding cuts. It has not yet announced which countries will be affected.\n\nThe move has been criticised by International Development Committee chair Sarah Champion, who said it appears the cuts will come at the expense of some of the worlds most vulnerable people.\n\nLiberal Democrat international development spokesperson Monica Harding said slashing UK aid spending to its lowest level this century will have an appalling impact on some of the worlds poorest and most vulnerable people.\n\nThis is only the beginning  we will see far deeper and crueller cuts next year when most of the reduction happens, she warned.\n\nIt is concerning that bilateral funding for Africa, gender, education and health programmes will drop, Bond policy director Gideon Rabinowitz said.\n\nThe worlds most marginalised communities, particularly those experiencing conflict and women and girls, will pay the highest price for these political choices.\n\nAt a time when the US has gutted all gender programming, the UK should be stepping up, not stepping back.\n\nUnicef, a UN agency providing aid to children, said the cuts will have a devastating and unequal impact on children and women and called the move deeply short-sighted.\n\nPhilip Goodwin, Unicef UK chief executive, said: We urge the government to adopt a new strategic approach that places vulnerable children at the heart of its aid programmes and policies\n\nAt least 25% of aid should be directed to child-focused initiatives, ensuring that childrens health, nutrition, education, and protection are prioritised.\n\nBritish-founded charity Street Child told the BBC that some of its work to help children get access to education in Sierra Leone, South Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo  where British aid has been a main backer  will come to an end because of the cuts.\n\nCEO Tom Dannatt said education was the greatest long-term builder of hope, and he described reducing the support as sad and short-sighted.\n\nSo children who used to go to school will not go to school, and so, more children will be found roaming the streets and ploughing fields and not developing their critical faculties, he said.\n\nWhereas they should be in school learning and having a chance to build a brighter future for themselves and for their societies, but because of these cuts by British aid for the poorest children, especially in the poorest countries, thats not the reality anymore.\n\nForeign aid has come under intense scrutiny in recent years, with the one cabinet ministeradmitting the public no longer supports spending on it.\n\nOne organisation that escaped the cuts was the World Bank. The Foreign Office confirmed that the International Development Association (IDA), the World Banks fund for the worlds lowest income countries, would receive 1.98bn in funding from the UK over the next three years, helping the organisation benefit 1.9 billion people.\n\nThe Labour governments under Sir Tony Blair and Gordon Brown committed to increasing the overseas aid budget to 0.7% of national income.\n\nThe target was reached in 2013 under David Camerons Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government, before being enshrined in law in 2015.\n\nHowever, aid spending was cut to 0.5% of national income in 2021 under the Conservatives, blaming the economic pressures of Covid.\n\n",
