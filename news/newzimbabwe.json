            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has lifted a two-year asset freeze on properties belonging to businessman Tobias Zangairai, ruling that the Prosecutor-General failed to act on allegations of unexplained wealth despite obtaining an interim order in 2023.\n\nJustice Benjamin Chikowero said it would be unjust to keep the order in place indefinitely without prosecution or civil forfeiture proceedings.\n\nThe order was never meant to remain in force in perpetuity, ruled Justice Chikowero. The Prosecutor-General has not taken advantage of that order by taking positive action. As I write this judgment, no criminal prosecution of the applicant for any serious crime vis--vis some or all of those properties has seen the light of day.\n\nThe case dates back to January 27, 2023, when the court, at the request of the Prosecutor-General, granted an unexplained wealth order and an interim freezing order against Zangairai.\n\nHe was required to explain how he acquired 24 immovable and movable assets, including residential stands across Harare, Bulawayo, Beitbridge, Mutare, and a fleet of vehicles ranging from a Toyota Hilux to a Nissan Civilian bus.\n\nZangairai complied, submitting a sworn statement to the Zimbabwe Republic Polices Asset Forfeiture Unit within the required 30 days.\n\nHowever, since then, the state took no further steps to prosecute him or apply for civil forfeiture.\n\nIn his defence, Zangairai argued that the prolonged freeze violated his constitutional right to use and enjoy his property.\n\nSection 71(2) of Zimbabwes Constitution guarantees every citizen the right to acquire, hold, occupy, use, transfer, hypothecate, lease or dispose of all forms of property.\n\nThe judge criticised the Prosecutor-Generals office for keeping Zangairais assets in limbo for more than two-and-a-half years without justification.\n\nIn these circumstances, it was not surprising that counsel for the first respondent was unable to make any meaningful submissions, Justice Chikowero said.\n\nIt would be unjust not to accede to the application for the setting aside of the interim freezing order.\n\nThe court ruled that Zangairai can now freely deal with his 24 assets, which include prime land in Marlborough, Salisbury Township, Mahatshula in Bulawayo, Chikanga in Mutare, and multiple stands in Beitbridge, along with vehicles such as a Toyota Nadia, Nissan Hardbody, Mazda Capella, and several Toyota Hiace minibuses.\n\nThe High Court formally granted Zangairais application, struck out a related case (HCHACC 130/24), and ordered that each party bear its own legal costs.\n\n",

            "content": "Xinhua\n\nIn recent years, Zimbabwes blueberry industry has grown rapidly, bringing local farmers higher incomes. This year, producers are setting their sights on exporting blueberries to China, one of the worlds largest and most lucrative markets.\n\nHARARE, Sept. 25 (Xinhua)  Inside a greenhouse located in ZimbabwesMashonaland West Province, workers carefully hand-pick fresh blueberries from lush green shrubs, ensuring only the best fruit makes it to the baskets.\n\nIn recent years, Zimbabwes blueberry industry has grown rapidly, bringing local farmers higher incomes. This year, producers are setting their sights on exporting blueberries to China, one of the worlds largest and most lucrative markets.\n\nEarlier this month, Zimbabwe signed a trade agreement allowing fresh blueberry exports to China, a move farmers say will spur production to meet the surge in demand.\n\nIt is a huge market. They are the biggest exporters of blueberries, among the biggest growers of blueberries, and also one of the biggest importers of blueberries. So, it really has taken off there, said Alistair Campbell, a blueberry farmer from the province.\n\nSupported by favorable climate conditions, increased agricultural investment, and rising demand for this healthy food, Zimbabwes blueberry industry is expanding. According to the countrys Horticultural Development Council (HDC), production is expected to rise from 8,000 metric tons in 2024 to 12,000 metric tons in 2025.\n\nFarmers believe that Zimbabwes strategic geographic location  allowing early access to global markets  gives the country a competitive edge. Our product is well received. We get big, nice-tasting berries. And its well-received in the market thus far. We just need more scale, more blueberries, Campbell said, adding that the opportunity to export to China positions Zimbabwe as a significant player in blueberry production.\n\nWe really need to get things moving pretty quickly. We hope to have some really good engagements with government to see what we can get done there, and also with funders to make sure that we get enough plants in the ground to satisfy at least a part of that Chinese market, he added.\n\nIn a statement following the signing of the blueberry export agreement, the HDC called for policies to increase investment, expand production to required volumes, and ensure that Zimbabwes blueberries consistently meet Chinas quality and phytosanitary standards.\n\nJoseph Kakoto, president of the Zimbabwe Young Farmers Association for Sustainable Development, a youth-led organization, expressed optimism about the growth prospects of the Chinese export market, saying the protocol would attract new investment in plantations, packhouses, and cold chain infrastructure, creating jobs along the value chain.\n\nThis protocol is a win-win. Zimbabwe gains access to a lucrative market, while China secures reliable food imports, Kakoto told Xinhua.\n\nThe deal, he said, signals Zimbabwes entry into high-value horticultural exports such as blueberries, opening the door to greater foreign currency earnings and investment.\n\nI am very confident about the Chinese market because it is huge and steadily growing with a rising middle class that demands healthy premium foods such as blueberries. Zimbabwes climate and soil are highly suitable for premium berries, giving us a competitive edge, he said.\n\n",
