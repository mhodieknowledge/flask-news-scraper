            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe sentencing of convicted businessmen Moses Mpofu and Mike Chimombewas further delayed on Monday to 1430 hoursafter their lawyers insisted they could not proceed without the written judgment, prompting Justice Pisirayi Kwendato reserve his ruling.\n\nLovemore Madhuku, taking instructions from Ashiel Mugiya and representing Chimombe, made an oral application in terms of section 4 of the sentencing guidelines, arguing that a copy of the written judgment of the copy that was read in court when they were convicted was essential for a fair sentencing process.\n\nWe are making the application in terms of sec 4 of the sentencing guidelines, he said, adding that although there was no express procedure, the guidelines give rights to accused persons. He argued that the Constitution gives the accused the right to a fair trial, and without sight of the written judgment, they will be unable to do proper mitigation and they will also be unable to respond adequately to the submission by the state on aggravation.\n\nHe said this would render their trial not fair, stressing that the accused did not take notes and needed to scrutinise the written judgment in the sense that it is relevant to the sentencing. Said Madhuku: It is a legal right of the applicant to get the judgment The request made by the accused persons is clearly not out of this world.\n\nThe accused persons certainly need the judgment to make preparations for the next steps. If the court says it is not readily available, the accused can wait; they are already in custody, he added, citing section 17(1)(c) which entitles an accused to be given adequate time and facilities to prepare a defence. He insisted, The request we are making is not too much. The judgment gives reasons for the convictions and the reasons are relevant for sentencing.\n\nTapson Dzvetero, representing Mpofu, concurred, saying proceeding without a written judgment would prejudice their clients. He said the law requires the court to produce its written judgment in accordance with legal provisions.\n\nState counsel Whisper Mabhaudhi opposed the application, arguing that the law provides only one circumstance where sentencing cannot proceed and there is nothing that can stop this court from sentencing the accused person. He said the defence did not cite relevant sections 331 and 333, instead relying on section 4, which is not applicable at all.\n\nMabhaudhi submitted that the request amounted to seeking further information, yet the judgment had already been delivered in open court, where parties were supposed to take notes, and no undertaking was made to release a written judgment before sentencing. The judgment which was delivered in the presence of the accused persons was final, he said.\n\nHe argued the accused do not require this judgment for any particular reason at all other than being a matter of preference, adding that their lawyers notes would suffice. Issues about the degree of participation were issues of appeal, he said.\n\nMabhaudhi added that proceedings were livestreamed and the accused were at liberty to go to YouTube where the proceedings were covered live The judgment is available in a video format, which they are at liberty to listen to at their own time.\n\nMadhuku dismissed that argument, saying, The accused persons do not have access to YouTube and we cannot take away the role they play in their own trial despite having lawyers.\n\nJustice Kwenda reserved the ruling to 1430 hours.\n\nThe pair was due for sentencing after being convicted of US$7 million fraud. Their sentencing has been repeatedly delayed, including after the State withdrew its earlier application for forfeiture of their properties.\n\n",

He is also a recipient of the SSRC Next Generation Social Sciences Fellowship (2023).\n\nThe appointment marks a return to organised scholarly activism for a journalist whose career has consistently bridged research, teaching, and frontline media work. For many observers in the journalism education sector, Chaunza represents a generation of scholar-practitioners pushing for African media curricula rooted in community knowledge, public accountability, and resistance to repression.\n\n",

This entitlement they have to South Africa is sickening.She added that the more South African government keeps nursing Zimbabweans and making them feel like they have rights, the more they start believing they have bigger rights than South Africans.Ngobese-Zuma said the influx of undocumented Zimbabweans has created resentment among locals, describing their attitude as intrusive and entitled.Ngobese-Zuma: Zimbabwean men have become cowardsThe activist went further, calling Zimbabwean men cowards for fleeing their country instead of confronting their political leadership.The reason we have entitled people like Dube here is because the men of Zimbabwe have become cowards.

What kind of solution is that? Who is staying behind in Zimbabwe? Who is fixing that country? she asked.Ngobese-Zuma concluded by saying Zimbabweans should listen to their ancestors and return home, insisting that South Africans have done enough to accommodate them.Their ancestors are calling them to go home, and we are helping them to go back, she said.\n\nZimbabwe is not a province of South Africa\n\nDube told Gagasi FM that the atmosphere in South Africa has grown increasingly hostile towards foreign nationals, citing the rise of anti-immigrant movements such as Operation Dudula.\n\nHe argued that politicians and activists often use the immigration issue for popularity, saying, Anybody who wants to go into politics and gain immediate attention must make noise about foreigners.Dube added that historically, South Africans and foreigners coexisted peacefully until groups like Operation Dudula emerged.However, Ngobese-Zuma dismissed his claims, accusing Zimbabweans of entitlement.I think Zimbabweans first of all need to understand that Zimbabwe is not a province of South Africa. This entitlement they have to South Africa is sickening.She added that the more South African government keeps nursing Zimbabweans and making them feel like they have rights, the more they start believing they have bigger rights than South Africans.Ngobese-Zuma said the influx of undocumented Zimbabweans has created resentment among locals, describing their attitude as intrusive and entitled.Ngobese-Zuma: Zimbabwean men have become cowardsThe activist went further, calling Zimbabwean men cowards for fleeing their country instead of confronting their political leadership.The reason we have entitled people like Dube here is because the men of Zimbabwe have become cowards. They no longer want to fight for Zimbabwe, they want to fight for South Africa, she said.She urged Zimbabweans to return home and challenge President Emmerson Mnangagwas regime instead of depending on South Africa for economic refuge.Whether there is Operation Dudula or March in March, that is none of Zimbabweans business.
