Stadium.\n\nBosso walk into the encounter dubbed Battle of Zimbabwe desperate for a victory following last weeks 0-1 defeat at home against Herentals FC.The two arch rivals meet not in the best of their forms as Highlanders are sitting on ninth position with 18 points while Dynamos are in the relegation zone (16) with nine points, that is two more than bottom-placed Kwekwe United.For Kelvin Kaindu, Sundays clash is a chance to revive his sides form.I think it comes at the time or probably at the weekend where both teams recorded losses.Im sure that this is also going to help both teams to go out, attack and search for victory.We are eyeing maximum points and we will do our best to get that, said Kaindu.Highlanders recorded a double over Dynamos last season, 2-0 and 2-1 in the first and second leg respectively.However, Kaindu is not sitting on last seasons dominance over their rivals, rather he is anticipating a tough encounter this time around.Not taking away anything from both teams, regardless of their position, I think this is a different game.Theres a lot at stake just for you to pick up those maximum points, added Kaindu.Dynamos have won one match out of 13 and a win against Highlanders will be the first for their new head coach Saul Chaminuka, who was appointed two weeks ago.\n\nBosso walk into the encounter dubbed Battle of Zimbabwe desperate for a victory

These will be at the intersection of Simon Mazorodze and Willowvale Roads, as well as Simon Mazorodze and Remembrance Drive.\n\nMnangagwa also said four more interchanges will be built at busy road points across Harare, including Mabvuku Junction, several spots along Harare Drive, and at major traffic circles like Westgate and Kuwadzana.\n\nAdditionally, four interchanges will also be constructed at the Mabvuku Junction; Harare Drive/Mutare Road; Harare Drive/Liberation Legacy Way; Nemakonde Way/Harare Drive; Sam Nujoma/Harare Drive; Westgate Traffic Circle; Kuwadzana Traffic Circle and Churchill/Liberation Way, Mnangagwa said.\n\nHe also added that nine junctions along Harare and Bulawayo Airport Roads will also be upgraded, and smart traffic systems will be used to improve traffic flow and road discipline.\n\nNine junctions shall be updated as part of the J. M. Nkomo Road (RGM International Airport Road) upgrade to grade separation structures.\n\nIn addition, smart traffic management systems are now also in place and will be deployed towards optimising traffic flow through intelligent systems. The roll out of these systems must be publicised and see greater discipline on our roads.Although the long-delayed project is now complete, its high cost reported at US$88 million has sparked public and parliamentary debate, with calls for an audit to clarify how the funds were used, as many accuse the government of massive looting.\n\n",
