            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has dismissed an application by Harare lawyer Emmanuel Mukwewa to rescind a default judgment ordering him and businessman Richard Paswa to jointly repay US$176,000 to Chinese investor Huang Li Qiang over a botched land deal.\n\nJustice Siyabona Musithu ruled that Mukwewa failed to show good and sufficient cause for setting aside the judgment, finding that his explanation for ignoring summons and his alleged defence were both without merit.The applicant failed to give a reasonable explanation for his failure to enter an appearance to defend, the judge said.The purported defence on the merits bears no prospects of success.The dispute arose in September 2023 when Huang entered into what was called an Agreement of Consultancy of Immovable Property drafted by Mukwewa. Under the deal, Paswa was to sell Huang a 20,000 square metre stand in Harares Coca Cola area. Huang paid US$170,000 of the purchase price, but the land was never delivered.In July 2024, after neither Paswa nor Mukwewa filed a defence to Huangs lawsuit, the court granted a default judgment, ordering the pair to refund Huang with interest and costs. The investor had accused Mukwewa of colluding with Paswa to defraud him, alleging the stand was non-existent.Mukwewa argued he only learned of the judgment months later and claimed he was not properly served since the summons was left at his old office gate after he had moved. He further insisted he acted only as a legal practitioner drafting the agreement, not as a party to the transaction.But Musithu rejected this, saying service by affixing was proper under the rules and that Mukwewas conduct in drafting and facilitating the deal went beyond mere legal drafting.The way the applicant handled the transaction, as well as the movement of the funds, was all shrouded in secrecy. It bears all the hallmarks of a fraudulent transaction, and regrettably, with the applicant as the main facilitator, the court ruled.The judge noted that Mukwewa styled the contract as a consultancy deal, yet it clearly amounted to a sale of immovable property which never existed.It gave the impression that the property was in existence at the time the applicant prepared the agreement of sale. Yet, as it turns out, the property did not exist,Musithu said.He added that Mukwewas failure to protect his clients interests, including releasing funds without ensuring title transfer, was professionally negligent at best and fraudulent at worst.The apparent lack of care exhibited by the applicant makes him susceptible to a claim of this nature, the judge concluded.Mukwewas application was dismissed with costs, leaving the default judgment against him and Paswa intact.\n\nJustice Siyabona Musithu ruled that Mukwewa failed to show good and sufficient cause for setting aside the judgment, finding that his explanation for ignoring summons and his alleged defence were both without merit.\n\nThe applicant failed to give a reasonable explanation for his failure to enter an appearance to defend, the judge said.The purported defence on the merits bears no prospects of success.The dispute arose in September 2023 when Huang entered into what was called an Agreement of Consultancy of Immovable Property drafted by Mukwewa.

The investor had accused Mukwewa of colluding with Paswa to defraud him, alleging the stand was non-existent.Mukwewa argued he only learned of the judgment months later and claimed he was not properly served since the summons was left at his old office gate after he had moved. He further insisted he acted only as a legal practitioner drafting the agreement, not as a party to the transaction.But Musithu rejected this, saying service by affixing was proper under the rules and that Mukwewas conduct in drafting and facilitating the deal went beyond mere legal drafting.The way the applicant handled the transaction, as well as the movement of the funds, was all shrouded in secrecy. It bears all the hallmarks of a fraudulent transaction, and regrettably, with the applicant as the main facilitator, the court ruled.The judge noted that Mukwewa styled the contract as a consultancy deal, yet it clearly amounted to a sale of immovable property which never existed.It gave the impression that the property was in existence at the time the applicant prepared the agreement of sale. Yet, as it turns out, the property did not exist,Musithu said.He added that Mukwewas failure to protect his clients interests, including releasing funds without ensuring title transfer, was professionally negligent at best and fraudulent at worst.The apparent lack of care exhibited by the applicant makes him susceptible to a claim of this nature, the judge concluded.Mukwewas application was dismissed with costs, leaving the default judgment against him and Paswa intact.\n\nThe dispute arose in September 2023 when Huang entered into what was called an Agreement of Consultancy of Immovable Property drafted by Mukwewa.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has dismissed a bid by former Zimbabwean diplomat Robert Mabulala to overturn the seizure of his Isuzu KB 280 truck by the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA), ruling that the tax authority acted lawfully in ordering the vehicles re-export to South Africa.\n\nJustice Siyabona Musithu, handing down judgment said Mabulalas challenge was devoid of merit and that ZIMRAs officials simply enforced the law.The respondent would not have been expected to act on the basis of a licence that had been issued in violation of the law, the judge said, adding: Section 3(1) of Statutory Instrument 54/24 is very clear that a vehicle which is imported in violation of that provision has to be re-exported at the importers expense.Mabulala served as a counsellor at Zimbabwes embassy in Pretoria between 2016 and June 2024. When his tour ended, he returned home with two vehicles: a Land Rover Defender and a second-hand Isuzu KB 280 manufactured in 2001.ZIMRA cleared the Defender under the immigrants rebate facility but refused to release the Isuzu, citing Statutory Instrument 54 of 2024, which bans the importation of second-hand vehicles older than ten years. Officials ordered the vehicle re-exported at Mabulalas cost.Mabulala argued that as a returning diplomat, he qualified for exemptions under SI 111 of 2024, which allows diplomats and returning residents to import older vehicles. He further pointed to an import licence issued to him in July 2024 as proof that his Isuzu qualified for clearance.But ZIMRA countered that the law only allows one motor vehicle per returning resident under the rebate scheme. The Defender had already been processed under that facility, meaning the Isuzu did not qualify. The authority also argued that Mabulalas import licence was nugatory because it was issued four months after SI 54/24 had outlawed such licences.Musithu agreed with ZIMRA, stressing that exemptions under SI 111/24 still fall under the one-vehicle limit.The explanatory note made it clear that the exemption applied to used vehicles imported by diplomats granted immigration rebates by ZIMRA the applicant could not claim a rebate of duty in respect of the Isuzu once he had claimed that same rebate in respect of the Defender, the judge said.He also dismissed Mabulalas reliance on the temporary report order that allowed him to move the car inland for clearance, saying it is merely a form of deferred clearance and not a guarantee of approval.Finding no basis to set aside ZIMRAs decision, the court ordered Mabulala to bear the authoritys legal costs.The decision cannot be characterised as grossly unreasonable or irrational, Justice Musithu ruled.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nPAUL Tungwarara, President Emmerson Mnangagwas investment advisor to the United Arab Emirates, and one of the individuals named in the recent corruption dossier tabled at the last Zanu PF Politburo meeting, has insisted he never fled the country.\n\nInstead, he says he simply travelled to Dubai to celebrate his newborn child.\n\nAddressing Zanu PF supporters at a Disbursement of Empowerment Fund meeting in Zvimba on Friday, Tungwarara was positively fired up, vowing to defend Mnangagwa tooth and nail. He declared that no one should even think about toppling Mnangagwa from power.\n\nWe are ready to defend our President and our party, and nothing is going to stop us. Nothing will stop the vision of the President, he asserted.\n\nLeaders are appointed by God. Stop dreaming of toppling the President. If a leader has been appointed by God, it is God himself who will remove him.\n\nTungwararas remarks further illustrate the rising tension in the Zanu PF succession battle, with every opportunity being used to demonstrate loyalty to Mnangagwa. He is considered to be part of a group that Vice President Constantino Chiwenga has labelled Zvigananda, a Shona term for those who amass wealth through illicit means.\n\nHaving been absent from the public eye for a while, social media had been awash with speculation that he had fled the country, fearing for his life. However, the business tycoon has refuted these rumours.\n\nI went to Dubai to see my newborn baby and spent some time there. Then some people started saying I fled the country. Fleeing from who and what? he asked.\n\nTungwarara is among those listed in the corruption dossier tabled by Chiwenga at the last Zanu PF Politburo meeting in Harare. He is mentioned alongside controversial tycoons Kudakwashe Tagwirei, Delish Nguwaya, and Wicknell Chivayo.\n\nThe quartet have been in the public eye for all the wrong reasons, chief among them being allegations of tender process manipulation. Tungwarara himself, through his company Prevail International Group, was awarded the tender to drill 10,000 boreholes under the Presidential Borehole Scheme.\n\nTungwarara was recently given a dressing down by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Agriculture for failing to deliver the boreholes and the Village Business Units as per the terms of the tender.\n\nTungwarara and his colleagues, Tagwirei and Chivayo, have also publicly pledged their support for Mnangagwa, vowing that he is going nowhere.\n\nTagwirei has scoffed at the corruption accusations and challenged Zimbabweans to put in their own tender applications and get some money.\n\n",

Positions being laid off have been outsourced to support financial and operational viability of the business as well as consolidation of the jobs for cost and headcount management, reads the notice in part.In contrast, the affected workers are pushing for a reasonable package, at least, decent enough for one to kick-start a viable project reflecting the years of committed service at a prestigious and well-oiled health facility.What is going on right now at the MIL is a deliberate ploy of sacrificing lowly paid workers. In fact whose salaries are way lesser than some of the executives airtime allowances in the name of easing financial pressures on the entity?If the company is not performing as alleged, why target small jobs and exclude top management who cream off bigger salaries and benefits? alleged one of the workers.Contacted for comment, the Avenues Clinic general manager, Sibusisiwe Ndlovu, alongside the communications officer, did not respond to phone calls and text messages despite blue ticking on Whatsapp.\n\nThe health group, which falls under Medical Investments Limited (MIL) recently tabled plans to lay off 50 workers as part of a strategic decision in the best interests of the company.\n\nFollowing the decision, documents seen by NewZimbabwe.com this week confirmed that the company offered to dole out Service Pay of one months salary for every year served, Notice Pay of three months salary in Lieu of Notice, Payment of Accrued Leave Days and Medical Aid Cover for three months up to December 31, 2025.Over and above the conditions, the company has announced a payment timeframe of six months.Considering that the least-serving employees facing the chop had served for just two and a half years while earning very small salaries, what this offer effectively means is that workers under such a bracket are set to take home just an estimated US$750 before tax.The highest paid workers who had served for about 27 years will be taking home an estimated US$8 500 and this is before tax, alleged one of the affected employees, who preferred anonymity.Another retrenched employee questioned the managements rationale arguing that there is a need to appreciate the services they extended to the organisation over the years by treating them with dignity.A Notice of Retrenchment filed by the MIL to the Retrenchment Board, which was also gleaned by our publication contains three main reasons behind the job cuts.We are embarking on the retrenchment exercise because of restructuring and remodelling of the business for prudent cash flow, management and cost containment.
