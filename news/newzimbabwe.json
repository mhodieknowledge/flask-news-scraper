Yet the government has put in place regulatory mechanisms to assist people to get into business, but they dont want to. They want to take money and put it into the pocketno safety for Zimbabweans and no compliance.\n\nRoads need to be maintained, police officers need to be paid by the government, where is the money coming from? The next thing is, you say the government is not providing a service; what contribution have you made?\n\nSo, first and foremost, all kombis must be registered, and kombi operators must lead by example in their operations by being responsible Zimbabweans, said the ZRP spokesman.\n\nOn enforcement of the law, Nyathi said all police officers are under instructions to carry out their duties professionally in accordance with police standards.\n\nZRP will take action against any police officer who will try to endanger the lives of Zimbabweans, Nyathi added.\n\nIn some instances, police officers have been blamed for road traffic accidents as they smash windscreens and chase after fleeing commuter omnibuses.\n\nMotorists were urged to comply with police officers and avoid running away. Also, Nyathi warned members of the public who try to interfere with police officers on duty.\n\nWhen you are arrested, you are not being killed. Youre simply being taken in to ensure the law takes its course. Why do you want to run away? Comply with the law; if you have to go to court, go to court and if you have to pay a fine, pay the fine, and go back to your business, Nyathi cautioned.\n\nThe ZRP Commissioner Paul Nyathi has urged the public not to board unregistered kombis as they are not insured.pic.twitter.com/sIKV4cHbKq\n\n NewZimbabwe.com (@NewZimbabweCom)March 12, 2025\n\nThe clampdown on unregistered kombis will be implemented without fear or favour, he added.\n\nThere is no going back in enforcing the governments law, and we are unapologetic about that, he said.\n\nOn corruption, Nyathi said bribe-taking police officers will be arrested alongside the motorists paying them off.\n\n",

Therefore, no other business entity outside the interbank market should determine the exchange rate.\n\nThe February 2025 Monetary Policy Statement again provided clarity that the 5% trading margin communicated in previous Interbank Foreign Exchange Trading Guidelines was only applicable for the determination of the starting exchange rate at the introduction of ZWG, he said.\n\nMushayavanhu added that banks are free to on-sell foreign currency purchased from willing sellers (including the RBZ) at a margin consistent with international best practices.\n\n",

In September 2023, it was renamed to Mutapa Investment Fund through Statutory Instrument 156 of 2023 by President Emmerson Mnangagwa using the Presidential Powers (Temporary Measures Act).\n\nMIF chief executive officer, Dr John Mangudya, told state controlled media that said strategies to turn around some parastatals were employed in the funds first year of existence.\n\nMIF is working on with its investee companies including putting in place a package for the procurement of buses by ZUPCO to augment Public transport.\n\nWorking with the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) to rehabilitate rail infrastructure and rolling stock, promoting rewarding Joint Ventures especially in the mining sector, developing sustainable operational models at Cottco, Silo Foods, Air Zimbabwe and the Cold Storage Commission (CSC), he said.\n\nThe entities mentioned by Mangudya were largely viewed as dead due to bad corporate governance with very little to offer to the countrys fiscus after degenerating into tiny shadows of their former selves before the coming in of the MIF, prompting many to regard the current initiatives as mammoth graveyard resurrection efforts.\n\nMIF CEO said the fund has made great strides within the first year of its operations geared to transform the economic and financial performance of portfolio companies under its purview in order to drive sustainable growth and development.\n\nApart from rescuing the ailing companies, the fund has also completed a diagnostic assessment of its investee companies and has come up with a strategic plan to catalyse national building by the entities under MIF.\n\nFor instance, the fund is closely working with the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) to enhance energy security in Zimbabwe through various initiatives that include prepaid metering, net metering, smart metering and enhancing base load through the implementation of independent power producers projects that include rehabilitating of Hwange Units 1 to 6 aimed at increasing electricity by around 600MW.\n\nThe fund is also focusing on strengthening board effectiveness, performance management and client centric across its entities. Also, we are working on enhancing value for money practices by optimizing capital management and practices within the group, added Mangudya.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nPatrice Motsepe has been re-elected unopposed as Confederation of African Football (Caf) president for a second term in office.\n\nThe 63-year-old South African, who has been Caf president since 2021, had announced his decision to stand again in October 2024.\n\nHis re-election for another four-year reign was confirmed at the Caf extraordinary general assembly in Cairo on Wednesday where Fifa president Gianni Infantino was in attendance.\n\nMotsepe, a mining magnate who also owns South African club Mamelodi Sundowns, had said he was looking tocontinue the good progresshe had made since coming to office four years ago.\n\nAlthough Motsepes re-election was a formality, elections were held for positions on Cafs executive committee with Cameroonian football legend Samuel Etoo winning a seat.\n\nThe continents representatives on the Fifa council were also voted in during Wednesdays executive general assembly.\n\nMotsepes second term in charge of African football was decided before Wednesdays events in Cairo after he became the first and only contender to run for office.\n\nThe lack of challengers could be seen as a vote of confidence in the South Africans presidency so far, having come to Caf at a time of crisis.\n\nIn 2021 he succeeded Ahmad of Madagascar who hadbecome the first Caf president to be banned by Fifa.\n\nSince then, the African football body has grown financially, making a $72m (55.5m) profit from last years Africa Cup of Nations (Afcon)  a sum 18 times bigger than that generated by the previous edition in 2022.\n\nWhen declaring his intent to run for a second term, Motsepe told the BBC progress had been made, but there is still a lot of work to be done.\n\nDuring his speech on Wednesday, he highlighted the issue of national stadiums across Africa as one of his key areas of focus.\n\nIn 2021, there were 36 countries that were not playing football in their countries. The number has come down to 12 but for us, this is still a big number, he said.\n\nAt Caf and Fifa, it is our job to continue supporting the development of sports infrastructure.\n\nThe election of four-time African Footballer of the Year Samuel Etoo on to Cafs decision-making executive committee was among the big talking points from Wednesdays events in Cairo.\n\nEtoo, president of the Cameroon Football Federation (Fecafoot), was elected unopposed as he was the only candidate from the central Africa region.\n\nLast week,the Court of Arbitration for Sport upheld an appeal by Etoo,externalwho won the right to be included on the list of candidates after initially being ruled out of the contest by Cafs governance committee in January.\n\nThe 44-year-old former Cameroon striker was suspended last year by both Fifa and Caf for violating disciplinary regulations.\n\nCaf had banned him after an inquiry into purported breaches of its ethical and integrity standards when he took up a role as ambassador for a betting company.\n\nThe ban and a $200,000 finewere later lifted on appeal.\n\nEtoo was greeted warmly by delegates around him when his name was announced along with the five other elected members on Cafs executive committee.\n\nThe former Barcelona and Inter Milan striker has been in charge of Fecafoot since December 2021 but has seen his tenure mired in controversy.\n\nLast September he received asix-match banfrom attending Cameroon games while one former international team-mate described him as adictatorfor his handling of the appointment of Indomitable Lions head coach Marc Brys.\n\nThere was also a vote to decide the six African representatives on the Fifa Council with Hany Abo Rida of Egypt and Fouzi Lekjaa of Morocco retaining their places.\n\nKanizat Ibrahim (Comoros), Hamidou Djibrilla Hima (Niger), Ahmed Yahya (Mauritania) and Souleymane Waberi (Djibouti) were elected for the first time.\n\nOn Cafs executive committee, five others were elected unopposed alongside Samuel Etoo.\n\nMustapha Ishola Raji of Liberia retained his seat for another four years, while Bestine Kazadi Ditabala (Democratic Republic of Congo), Wallace Karia (Tanzania), Kurt Simeon-Okraku (Ghana) and Sadi Walid (Algeria) are new to the committee.\n\nElvis Chetty of the Seychelles lost his place when Feizal Sidat (Mozambique) and Samir Sobha of Mauritius were voted in to represent southern Africa.\n\n",
