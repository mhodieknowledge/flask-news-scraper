            "content": "AFP\n\nAfghanistanveteran Hashmatullah Shahidi andZimbabwerookie Brian Bennett starred as the first Test was drawn after a rain-shortened final day in Bulawayo on Monday.\n\nShahidi claimed an Afghan record 246 runs at the end of a marathon innings while spinner Bennett took five wickets.\n\nZimbabwe made 586 and 142-4 to lead Afghanistan by 29 runs at stumps after the tourists posted 699. Both first innings scores were national records.\n\nWith Zimbabwe 88-4 in their second innings and 25 runs behind, batting stability was required and the unbeaten partnership of veterans Sean Williams (35) and Craig Ervine (22) provided it.\n\nShahidi departed after being trapped leg before by Bennett, whose 5-95 were the best figures among the six-man Zimbabwe attack.\n\nThe 30-year-old left-hand batter faced 474 balls in 694 minutes, and struck 21 fours at Queens Sports Club in the southwestern city.\n\nHis partnerships with Rahmat Shah (364 runs) and Afsar Zazai (211) ensured Afghanistan took a 113-run first innings lead.\n\nThe previous highest Test score of Shahidi was 200 not out, also against Zimbabwe, in Abu Dhabi three years ago.\n\nBefore the exit of Shahidi, wicketkeeper Zazai claimed a maiden Test century, hitting 113 before being caught at backward point by substitute Johnathan Campbell.\n\nThe fall of Shahidi triggered a collapse with the final six Afghanistan wickets going for just 20 runs in four overs as the off spin of Bennett wreaked havoc.\n\nBennett, a 21-year-old appearing in only his second Test, twice took wickets from successive balls only to be deprived of hat-tricks on both occasions.\n\nHe also shone with the bat, making 110 not out in the first innings after Zimbabwe captain Ervine won the toss.\n\nBatting a second time, Zimbabwe put on 73 runs before an outside edge from Joylord Gumbie (24) allowed Shahidi to make a simple catch in the slips.\n\nThe fall of the wicket was followed almost immediately by mid-afternoon rain that led to a one hour delay.\n\nTest debutant Ben Curran, a son of deceased former Zimbabwe coach Kevin Curran and brother of England internationals Tom and Sam, made 41 before being run out.\n\nGumbie, Curran and Takudzwanashe Kaitano (5) fell in the space of 14 balls, with spinner Zahir Khan taking two wickets, and Dion Myers(4) was bowled by teenage spinner Allah Ghazanfar.\n\nBrief scores\n\nZimbabwe 586 in 135.2 overs and 142-4 in 34 overs (Ben Curran 41, Sean Williams 35 not out, Craig Ervine 22 not out; Zahir Khan 2-43) v Afghanistan 699 in 197 overs (Hashmatullah Shahidi 246, Rahmat Shah 234, Afsar Zazai 113; Brian Bennett 5-95)\n\nResult: Match drawn\n\nToss: Zimbabwe\n\n",

For instance, durians and mangosteens are tropical fruits that could thrive in Zimbabwes environment. Additionally, kiwifruit and dragon fruit have already begun to be cultivated in Matabeleland South, where the sunny conditions are ideal for their growth, said ZIMTRADE.\n\nThe agency said South Africa, the leading African exporter to China, has successfully captured a considerable market share, exporting nuts worth $246 million and citrus fruits worth $190 million.\n\nThis success story serves as a powerful reminder that Zimbabwean farmers can also stake their claim in this lucrative market by enhancing their capacities as individual growers, forming cooperatives, and collaborating as a nation to strengthen our export capabilities,  said ZIMTRADE.\n\nTo successfully penetrate the Chinese market, the agency said Zimbabwean farmers must navigate a complex landscape of regulations and standards.\n\nFirst and foremost, obtaining market access approval from the General Administration of Customs of the Peoples Republic of China (GACC) is essential.\n\nThis process requires adherence to Chinas stringent food safety and phytosanitary standards, which include meeting maximum residue limits (MRLs) for pesticides, complying with labelling requirements, and ensuring product traceability.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nFormer US President Jimmy Carter has died aged 100, the centre he founded has confirmed.\n\nThe former peanut farmer lived longer than any president in history and celebrated his 100th birthday in October.\n\nThe Carter Center, which advocates for democracy and human rights around the world, said he died on Sunday afternoon at his home in Plains, Georgia.\n\nThe Democrat served as president from 1977 to 1981, a period beset by economic and diplomatic crises.\n\nAfter leaving the White House with low approval ratings, his reputation was restored through humanitarian work which earned him the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nMy father was a hero, not only to me but to everyone who believes in peace, human rights, and unselfish love, his son, Chip Carter, said in a statement.\n\nThe world is our family because of the way he brought people together, and we thank you for honouring his memory by continuing to live these shared beliefs.\n\nCarter  who prior to becoming president was governor of Georgia, a lieutenant in the US navy and a farmer  is survived by his four children, 11 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.\n\nHis wife, Rosalynn, who he was married to for 77 years, died in November 2023.\n\nSince 2018 and the death of George HW Bush, he was the oldest surviving US president.\n\nCarter stopped medical treatment for an undisclosed illness last year and instead began receiving hospice care at his home.\n\nPresident Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden said the world had lost an extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian.\n\nDescribing him as a dear friend and a man of principle, faith and humility, they added: He showed that we are a great nation because we are a good people  decent and honorable, courageous and compassionate, humble and strong.\n\nThe challenges Jimmy faced as president came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans, President-elect Donald Trump wrote on social media.\n\nFor that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.\n\nCarters presidency will be remembered for his struggles in dealing with acute economic problems and several foreign policy challenges, including the Iran hostage crisis, which ended with the deaths of eight Americans.\n\nThere was, however, a notable foreign policy triumph in the Middle East when he helped broker an accord between Egypt and Israel, signed at Camp David in the US in 1978.\n\nBut that seemed a distant memory two years later, when voters overwhelmingly chose Republican Ronald Reagan, who had portrayed the president as a weak leader unable to deal with inflation and interest rates at near record highs.\n\nCarter lost the 1980 election by a landslide, winning only six US states plus Washington DC.\n\nIn the aftermath of such a heavy defeat, Carter was frequently held up by Republicans as an example of liberal ineptitude.\n\nMeanwhile, many in his own party either ignored him or viewed his presidential shortcomings as evidence their brand of Democratic politics or policy was a better way.\n\nToday many on the right still deride the Carter years but as the decades passed, his humanitarian efforts and simple lifestyle began to shape a new legacy for many Americans.\n\nAfter leaving the White House, he became the first and only president to return full-time to the house he lived in before politics  a humble, two-bedroom ranch-style home.\n\nHe chose not to pursue the lucrative after-dinner speeches and publishing deals awaiting most former presidents,telling the Washington Post in 2018that he never really wanted to be rich.\n\nInstead, he spent his remaining years trying to address global problems of inequality and disease.\n\nHe also teamed up with Nelson Mandela to found The Elders, a group of global leaders who committed themselves to work on peace and human rights.\n\nIn accepting his Nobel prize in 2002  only the third US president to receive it  he said: The most serious and universal problem is the growing chasm between the richest and the poorest people on Earth.\n\nIn a statement, former President Bill Clinton and wife Hillary Clinton said he worked tirelessly for a better, fairer world, noting his humanitarian, environmental and diplomatic efforts.\n\nGuided by faith, President Carter lived to serve others  until the very end, they added.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama paid tribute to Carters decency and said he taught all of us what it means to live a life of grace, dignity, justice, and service.\n\nRepublican former President George W Bush, meanwhile, said Carter dignified the office and that his efforts to leave behind a better world didnt end with the presidency.\n\nPresident Biden said a state funeral would be held in Washington DC.\n\n",
