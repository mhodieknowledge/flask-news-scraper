            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner atMadzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal)to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, following recent revelations by Channel 4 news of an environmental catastrophe in Zambia, our neighbor, allegedly as a result of the spilling of a cocktail of toxic materials in the Kafue river by a Chinese company, we want to discuss our own environmental compliance in the Zimbabwe mining sector and whether enough is being done to protect us from such an occasion?\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nI am aware of the alleged contamination which allegedly happened in February this year and has recently made headlines around the world. There are conflicting reports as to the extent of the contamination and counter allegations of geopolitical connotations which I will not bedevil myself discussing.\n\nWhat is critical from a Zimbabwe context is that the environment and its protection are an ongoing obligation and its conservation should continually be monitored and discussed as the mining sector grows because of the permanency of the effects of environmental contamination and the potential impact of certain mining methods on the way of life of our posterity.\n\nEnvironmental protection is one of the areas where patriotism by either enforcers or local actors is a must. Our blessing in the extent and diversity of our mineral resources is conversely our curse in enforcement costs.\n\nOur laws governing environmental protection in general and the mining sector in particular are well developed and comparative in the region. However, from a cost perspective, monitoring for bigger mining players in the industry is simpler and for smaller players slightly more difficult, despite the laws being in place.\n\nReporter:What laws are in place to protect the environment against the impact of mining?\n\nVM: As a start, it is important to understand that environmental protection is a constitutional right. Our constitution establishes that every person has a right to an environment that is not harmful to their health and wellbeing. It therefore obliges our lawmakers to secure the protection of the environment.\n\nSuch laws include the Environment Management Act [Ch20:27], being the main legislation governing environmental issues, assisted by other complementary legislation like the Water Act and Forestry Act prescribing conservation laws. Further and specific to the mining industry, the current Mines and Minerals Act [Ch21:05] and the proposed Mining Bill have prescriptive provisions aimed at protecting and rehabilitating mining areas before, during and after mining.\n\nWe also have statutory instruments released from time to time to address areas that may not have been addressed by current legislation, for example, the Environmental Management (Control of Alluvial Mining) Amendment Regulations, 2024, published as Statutory Instrument 188 of 2024, banning alluvial prospecting and mining along river beds. As stated earlier, it is an ongoing engagement that requires the affected parties, responsible bodies and parliament to remain vigilant in prescribing and reacting to issues of environmental concern.\n\nReporter: If the laws are in place, what are the common environmental violations in Zimbabwe and their reasons?\n\nVM: I think the question has to be addressed contextually. Zimbabwe has an abundance of various minerals over vast areas, making monitoring expensive for the responsible bodies. Further, as our mining methods are a mix of mechanised large and medium scale mining together with small scale artisanal mining, mainly by locals and in some unfortunate circumstances by foreign companies.\n\nThe application and enforcement of the laws become difficult in the absence of general community engagement and education, specifically from a constitutional right perspective. Our Environmental Management Act grants a unique right to any person or group acting in the public interest the right to approach our courts and stop or interdict an activity that is harmful to the environment, even where the person or group is not directly affected by the activity. This, in our law, is a powerful right which is not used enough.\n\nTo the first part of your question, the common violations are land degradation, deforestation, and abandonment of mining sites without rehabilitation, causing potential damage to animals and humans. This normally results from miners operating without an environmental impact assessment report (EIA), which is a prerequisite and prescribes community engagement, enabling the community to be aware of the potential mining activity and its plan for land rehabilitation.\n\nReporter: What liabilities are in place for companies or individuals that are caught contaminating or destroying the environment?\n\nVM: There are administrative orders and penalties that are chargeable directly from the Environmental Management Authority (EMA) that may compel a miner to do a certain thing or cease doing a certain thing. Beyond this, a miner may suffer civil liabilities from affected parties for damage caused to the environment which may include individuals, companies and communities. In the extreme and specifically for those miners who operate without an EIA, there are criminal sanctions or liabilities.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nThe people of Malawi are set to vote for their next leader, following a turbulent five years involving economic turmoil, natural disasters and the shock death of the nations vice-president.\n\nCurrent President Lazarus Chakwera is vying for a second term, his main rival being Peter Mutharika, an octogenarian who has also held office in the southern African nation once before.\n\nTransparency and fairness are key talking points ahead of the vote, given that the result of Malawis 2019 presidential election was overturned in the courts due to widespread irregularities.\n\nPolling day is Tuesday 16 September 2025.\n\nThe 7.2 million registered voters will be taking part in three elections:\n\nAFP/Getty Images Lazarus Chakwera (L) and Peter Mutharika (R) have faced each other at the ballot before\n\nAmong the 17 hopefuls there are two clear front-runners.\n\nChakwera and Mutharika will square off against each other at the polls for the fourth time  though the third time ended up not counting.\n\nMutharika first defeated Chakwera in 2014, but when he was declared winner over Chakwera in the next election in 2019 the result was annulled. Chakwera won the re-run the following year.\n\nLazarus Chakwera  Malawi Congress Party (MCP)\n\nChakwera, a former theology lecturer and preacher, had no political experience when he emerged as leader of the MCP in 2013.\n\nWhen he ran for president in 2014 he was unsuccessful, but in 2020 he triumphed,beating the incumbent, Mutharika, in that unprecedented re-run.\n\nChakweras time in office has been marred by economic turmoil and allegations of corruption. The 70-year-old did, however, reintroduce train services in Malawi for the first time in over three decades. He has also overseen major road construction across the country.\n\nPeter Mutharika  Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)\n\nMutharika, an 85-year-old former lawyer and law lecturer, led Malawi from 2014 to 2020.\n\nHe is the brother of the late President Bingu wa Mutharika, who died in office in 2012.\n\nLike Chakwera, Mutharika is also burdened by corruption allegations and links to economic crises. However, his supporters would argue that the current high inflation rate (around 27%) is proof that Mutharika managed the economy better than his successor.\n\nMutharikas age may count against him this election  speculation about his health is rife, especially as he has rarely been seen out in public during the campaign period.\n\nOther contenders garnering attention are former presidentJoyce Banda(Peoples Party), current Vice-PresidentMichael Usi(Odya Zake Alibe Mlandu)and former reserve bank governorDalitso Kabambe(UTM).\n\nThe economy\n\nMalawi has long been one of the poorest countries in the world, butthe past few years have been especially punishing.\n\nThe country wasdevastated by Cyclone Freddythat killed hundreds of people in 2023, then a drought swept across southern Africa the following year. Food prices skyrocketed due to a short supply of crops, pushing many Malawians into extreme poverty.\n\nEconomists also put Malawis current inflation problems partly down to the shortage of foreign currencies  known as forex  in the banks.\n\nIn addition, Malawi has beenforced to devalue its currencyand was recently crippled by fuel shortages and nationwide power outages.\n\nCorruption\n\nWhen Chakwera came to power, he vowed to to clear the rubble of corruption that has long plagued Malawian politics. His administration says it has excelled in this area, but critics  including the influential Catholic Church  say this is not the case.\n\nScepticism was sparked last year when the director of public prosecutions dropped corruption charges against high-profile figures.\n\nAdditionally, Malawis anti-graft agency, the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB), has been without a director since former boss Martha Chizuma left more than a year ago.\n\nTo some, the failure to appoint a new head actively hinders the fight against corruption.\n\nBut previous administrations have also been dogged by graft allegations. For instance, the ACBaccused Mutharika of receiving a kickback from a contractto supply food to the police  he denied any wrongdoing.\n\nBandas reputation was dented by a scandal dubbed cashgate which happened under her watch. She was cleared by the ACB of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe former vice-presidents death\n\nIn June last year, Vice-PresidentSaulos Chilima died in a plane crash. Popular with the youth, Chilima led the UTM party and could have been a key contender in the upcoming elections, especially as he had fallen out with the president.\n\nAlthough two investigations  one carried out by Germanys aviation accidents agency and another by a Malawi government-appointed commission  did not find evidence of foul play, some Malawians remain suspicious of the authorities.\n\nOpposition parties have been fuelling this scepticism during their campaigns, referring to Chakweras party as the Chikangawa Party (Chikangawa Forest being the site of the plane crash).\n\nAFP/Getty Images Hundreds in Malawi lost their lives to Cyclone Freddy\n\nMalawi was governed by the MCP from its independence in 1964 until the countrys first multi-party poll in 1994.\n\nSince the shift from a one-party state, the United Democratic Front, the DPP, the Peoples Party and the MCP have all enjoyed stints in power.\n\nChakweras victory with the MCP in 2020 was one of the most significant moments in the countrys political history.\n\nA general election had taken place the year before and Mutharika was declared the winner.\n\nHowever,the Constitutional Court annulled the election, saying there had been widespread tampering, including the use of Tipp-Ex correction fluid on results sheets.\n\nJudges ordered a re-run for 2020, and Chakwera won with 59% of the vote after having teamed up with Chilima.\n\nAlthough Mutharika branded the re-run unacceptable, the Constitutional Court gained international acclaim for safeguarding democracy and refusing to be influenced by presidential power.\n\nFollowing the controversy of the 2019 election, Malawi implemented a new system, where a candidate must gain more than 50% of the total votes to win the presidency in the first round.\n\nThere is a strong possibility that this years candidates will not reach this threshold in the initial poll, meaning a run-off election will have to be held.\n\nThe MCP and DPP will likely try to bring other, smaller parties on board in order to secure a majority in the second time round.\n\nThe courts actions following the 2019 vote have given some Malawians faith in the electoral process.\n\nHowever, over the past months, a number or civil society organisations and opposition parties have accused the electoral commission of favouring the MCP, alleging that its top management has links to the governing party. The commission has firmly denied being biased.\n\nA protest in June calling for the resignation of the commissions top officials was attacked by masked, machete-wielding men, leading to concerns about freedom of expression in the run-up to the election.\n\nThe assault was not an isolated incident  there have been numerous reports of politically motivated violence ahead of the general election.\n\nThe outcome of the presidential election will be announced by the end of 24 September.\n\nThe parliamentary results will be announced by the end of 30 September.\n\n",

He reportedly discussed strengthening cooperation in trade, health, agriculture, mining, investment, technologyincluding milestones like ZIMSAT1and reaffirmed commitment to deepen ZimbabweJapan relations.\n\nOnly last week, the 82-year-old Zanu PF leader met with His Holiness Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican, where they reflected on the Catholic churchs vital role in Zimbabwes schools, hospitals, and social services, and shared views on peace and justice in todays world.\n\nBefore the jetleg could subside, Mnangagwa, whose initial days in office were toned around austerity to cut on spending on foreign travel, he was off to the East this Sunday.\n\nAccording to State media, Mnangagwa is expected to join fellow invited Heads of State and Government from 26 countries, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, at Tiananmen Square for a massive military parade among other activities hosted by China for the commemorations.\n\nThe Chinese Peoples War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-1945) was the first to break out and lasted the longest in the World Anti-Fascist War.\n\nAccording to reports, in 14 years, 35 million Chinese were killed or wounded. Japan officially surrendered on September 2, 1945 by signing the Instrument of Surrender.\n\nIn 2014, Chinas national legislature designated September 3 as Victory Day of its War of Resistance.\n\nA year later, the country held its first-ever large-scale parade at Tiananmen Square to mark the occasion.\n\nState media quoted Zimbabwes Ambassador to China, Abigail Shoniwa, saying President Mnangagwa, who left the Vatican last night, is one of a few African leaders invited to the event, signalling deep ties between Harare and Beijing.\n\nThe Presidents arrival is awaited and we are very excited, he is coming at the invitation of his counterpart, President Xi Jinping and he will be one of quite a number of Heads of State that are coming.\n\nPerhaps, I can take the opportunity to add that he is one of the very few African Heads of State coming, Shoniwa told State media.\n\nWhile in China, Mnangagwa is billed to hold bilateral talks with President Xi on deepening co-operation across various sectors.\n\nThe octogenarian leader will also dialogue with company executives with business interests in Zimbabwe.\n\nChina has supported Zimbabwes various local projects, including Hwange Units 7 and 8 expansion, Kariba South Hydro Power Extension, expansion of the Robert Gabriel Mugabe and Victoria Falls International Airports.\n\nChina is Zimbabwes largest source of investment with cumulative investments exceeding US$4,4 billion, including US$400 million in the past year alone.
