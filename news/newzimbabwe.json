            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nERIC Niyonsaba, a Ugandan national and businessman, has demanded retraction of articles on popular site Bus Stop TV and Zim Times, both of which accused him of harbouring and financing Rwandese Intelligence Service operatives killing suspects of the 1994 genocide.\n\nNiyonsaba, who owns Fresh Kambucha Zimbabwe, gave the two publications 12 hours to act, in letters sent on May 23 by his lawyer Admire Rubaya.Failure, he said, will result in his client instituting legal proceedings, to get managers of both publications arrested and prosecuted for malicious damage to his clients image and that of his company.The letter was also copied to Police Commissioner General Stephen Mutamba.Circumstances are that the two produced a report indicating Niyonsaba as one of many Ugandan nationals running cover companies, including tuckshops, that were financing Rwandan secret service operatives in an operation targeting suspects of the world infamous 1994 genocide.The article was titled Kagame intelligence agents allegedly involved in killings of genocide suspects in Zimbabwe.The statement that you published on your website is defamatory and was understood by a reasonable reader, follower or social media user that our client is an illicit business which is a front for the Rwandan Intelligence services which houses terrorists and criminals who are killing people allegedly connected to the Rwanda 1994 genocide, said Rubaya in the letter.You have actively discouraged your followers and other social media users from purchasing the product (Fresh Kambucha), thereby potentially harming our clients reputation and business interests.He has no connection whatsoever to the Rwandan Intelligence Services or any of the individuals that you alleged he works with to fund the alleged extra judicial killings.He does not house any terrorists who are allegedly conducting the alleged extra judicial killings and that he is not involved in spying for the Rwandan Intelligence Services.Further allegations that Fresh Kambucha had not undergone rigorous tests to prove its safety, were said to have significantly affected Niyonsabas business.Added Rubaya: Our client has a traceable record of clean and well manufactured Kambucha drinks, which have been scientifically tested to the extent that no adverse report has been authored by the relevant authorities.Our client is a genuine international investor who originates from the great country of Uganda, which is led by the African son Yoweri Kaguta Museveni. He is lawfully in Zimbabwe and is just but a pure businessman who is creating employment for Zimbabweans and contributing to the national fiscus.Our clients reputation has been severely damaged and now on the verge of losing many lucrative contracts and has the real risk of being declared the enemy of the peace-loving Zimbabwean government and being called a person of interest by the Zimbabwean law enforcement agents.We enjoin you to take these allegations seriously, failing which you will only have yourselves to blame.In the event that you fail to retract the defamatory statement as demanded our client shall proceed to issue summons and claim damages for defamation as well as lodge a criminal complaint against those who run the website and/or your social media pages without any further notice to you.\n\nNiyonsaba, who owns Fresh Kambucha Zimbabwe, gave the two publications 12 hours to act, in letters sent on May 23 by his lawyer Admire Rubaya.\n\nFailure, he said, will result in his client instituting legal proceedings, to get managers of both publications arrested and prosecuted for malicious damage to his clients image and that of his company.The letter was also copied to Police Commissioner General Stephen Mutamba.Circumstances are that the two produced a report indicating Niyonsaba as one of many Ugandan nationals running cover companies, including tuckshops, that were financing Rwandan secret service operatives in an operation targeting suspects of the world infamous 1994 genocide.The article was titled Kagame intelligence agents allegedly involved in killings of genocide suspects in Zimbabwe.The statement that you published on your website is defamatory and was understood by a reasonable reader, follower or social media user that our client is an illicit business which is a front for the Rwandan Intelligence services which houses terrorists and criminals who are killing people allegedly connected to the Rwanda 1994 genocide, said Rubaya in the letter.You have actively discouraged your followers and other social media users from purchasing the product (Fresh Kambucha), thereby potentially harming our clients reputation and business interests.He has no connection whatsoever to the Rwandan Intelligence Services or any of the individuals that you alleged he works with to fund the alleged extra judicial killings.He does not house any terrorists who are allegedly conducting the alleged extra judicial killings and that he is not involved in spying for the Rwandan Intelligence Services.Further allegations that Fresh Kambucha had not undergone rigorous tests to prove its safety, were said to have significantly affected Niyonsabas business.Added Rubaya: Our client has a traceable record of clean and well manufactured Kambucha drinks, which have been scientifically tested to the extent that no adverse report has been authored by the relevant authorities.Our client is a genuine international investor who originates from the great country of Uganda, which is led by the African son Yoweri Kaguta Museveni.

That means they are not replacing the real experts.

It is not even enough for transport and lunch. The AUT, therefore, did not see any reason to interfere with their process. The situation at UZ as of today is pathetic.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nCONTROVERSIAL Zimdancehall artist Jimmy Mudereri, also known as Silent Killer who is facing a US$122,000 lawsuit for alleged breach of contract, is adamant he does owe anyone an apology.\n\nMusic promotions company, Y2K Entertainment, the organisers of the UK SAMA Festival, recently issued a letter of demand to the Mbare-born artist after he failed to attend a gig scheduled for April 2025.\n\nSilent Killer missed the festival after refusing to board a flight, citing a troubling dream about an airplane explosion.\n\nDespite checking in at Robert Mugabe International Airport, he backed out at the last minute, prompting the organisers to buy a second flight ticket costing $1,500, but he locked himself in a toilet to avoid flying.\n\nY2K Entertainment claims Silent Killer breached his performance contract, resulting in significant financial losses and reputational damage which has now led them to send a letter of demand for a total amount of US$122,170, within seven days.\n\nIn an interview with ZimboLive, Silent Killer, said he doesnt owe anyone an apology.\n\nI dont owe anybody an apology. I am asking for an apology from them because somehow I think that they think that the law works for them or belongs to them. Even I can be protected by the law. If its a crime, a magistrate is going to determine that. The law is going to determine that, said a defiant Silent Killer.\n\nHe went on to warn that he is under the protection of Prophet Walter Magaya if they dare to poke him.\n\nI read that letter and I cant say sorry that I was the one who leaked. The letter was sent to my lawyers, this is between the lawyers. Remember Im the son of Prophet Magaya, so whatever you plan on me, rains will pour, said Silent Killer.\n\nIn the letter of demand, Y2K Entertainment alleges that they incurred substantial expenses, including cost of three airfare tickets and various payments made to facilitate his travel and Visa application.\n\nWe are instructed by our client to demand, as we hereby do; that you pay the sum of USD122, 170 (One hundred and twenty-two thousand one hundred and seventy United States Dollars) which amount is now due to our client and must be paid within seven (7) days of being served with this letter.\n\nYou are also further expected to pay US$12, 217 (Twelve thousand two hundred and seventeen United States dollars) being our collection commission, reads part of the letter.\n\n",

            "content": "Hydroponics has revolutionized gardening and farming by eliminating the need for soil, allowing plants to grow faster, healthier, and more efficiently. At the heart of every successful hydroponic system lies a critical factor: hydroponic nutrients. These nutrient solutions are the life source for plants, replacing the traditional minerals and organic matter found in soil.\n\nUnderstanding hydroponic nutrients  how they work, how to manage them, and how to optimize their use  is key to achieving strong yields and healthy plants. Whether youre just starting with hydroponics or scaling up to a commercial setup, mastering nutrients is a must.\n\nIn hydroponic systems, plants depend entirely on the grower for their nutritional needs. Unlike traditional farming, where soil acts as a buffer and nutrient reservoir, hydroponics delivers nutrients directly through water. This direct delivery means plants absorb essential elements faster and more efficiently, leading to faster growth cycles andbigger harvests.\n\nHydroponic nutrients include a mix of macronutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), along with secondary elements such as calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. Trace minerals like iron, manganese, boron, and zinc are equally vital, supporting photosynthesis, cell structure, and root development.\n\nBy precisely controlling nutrient levels, growers can tailor feeding schedules to each plants growth stage, dramatically improving outcomes.\n\nNot all nutrient solutions are created equal. Some are designed for general use, while others are tailored for specific crops like leafy greens, herbs, or fruiting plants. The choice of nutrients also depends on the type of hydroponic system being used  for instance, deep water culture (DWC) systems often need slightly different nutrient balances than drip irrigation setups.\n\nBeginners often start withpre-formulated hydroponic nutrients, which offer balanced profiles for a range of plants. Advanced growers might customize their own blends to fine-tune nutrient delivery. Monitoring factors like electrical conductivity (EC) and pH ensures that plants are receiving exactly what they need without risking deficiencies or toxicities.\n\nGrowers serious about optimizing their setups often turn to top hydroponic nutrient techniques to maintain peak system performance and avoid common pitfalls.\n\nStarting with hydroponic nutrients can seem overwhelming at first, but it becomes second nature with practice. Beginners should focus on understanding three key aspects: nutrient types, concentration levels, and pH control.\n\nPre-mixed nutrient solutions specifically formulated for beginners offer a reliable starting point. Many are labeled according to plant type or growth stage (vegetative vs flowering), making selection easier. Monitoring pH is equally important, as incorrect levels can lock nutrients out, even if they are present in the solution.\n\nTo simplify the learning curve, new growers can explore guides likehydroponic nutrients for beginners, where step-by-step instructions make it easy to avoid mistakes and build strong foundational skills.\n\nMastering the basics early ensures a smoother, more productive journey into the world of hydroponic gardening.\n\nSuccessful hydroponic gardening doesnt stop at adding nutrients to water; it requires consistent monitoring and adjustments. EC meters and pH testing kits are essential tools for keeping nutrient solutions within the ideal range.\n\nAs plants absorb nutrients and water evaporates, concentrations can fluctuate. Without careful monitoring, plants may face nutrient deficiencies, stunted growth, or salt buildup in the system. Regularly checking solution strength, topping off water levels, and flushing systems, when necessary, ensures a stable environment for roots to thrive.\n\nAutomated nutrient dosing systems are becoming increasingly popular, especially for larger or commercial hydroponic operations. These smart systems help maintain ideal conditions with minimal manual effort.\n\nIncorporating hydroponic nutrient balance strategies into regular garden management improves long-term success and plant vitality.\n\nEven experienced growers can make errors when it comes to nutrients. Overfeeding, underfeeding, or failing to monitor pH can all lead to disappointing harvests. Recognizing the signs of imbalance  such as yellowing leaves, slow growth, or nutrient burn  is critical for quick intervention.\n\nOne useful strategy is implementing a simple feeding chart and adjusting based on plant response rather than blindly following general schedules. Also, regularly cleaning and sterilizing equipment prevents salt buildup and contamination, two often-overlooked nutrient management issues.\n\nHydroponic success isnt about having perfect systems from the start; its about observing plants, learning from each cycle, and refining techniques over time.\n\nTechnology is transforming how growers manage nutrients. Innovations like real-time nutrient monitors, AI-assisted dosing systems, and environmentally friendly nutrient sources are making hydroponic gardening more sustainable and scalable.\n\nAs hydroponic systems become smarter and more automated, the growers role evolves into that of a manager and optimizer. Learning hydroponic nutrient fundamentals today sets gardeners up for long-term success as these technologies become more widespread.\n\nBy understanding and mastering hydroponic nutrients now, growers position themselves at the forefront of a greener, smarter future for agriculture and food production.\n\n",
