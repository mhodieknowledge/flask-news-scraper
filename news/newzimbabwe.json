Across the world and even here in Africa, the change has been seen. Countries are working very hard.\n\nMumba urged policymakers and responsible stakeholders to make decisions and adopt policies that prioritize wetland protection.\n\nLet us make this moment where political leadership meets practical action, when commitments become implementation, and where wetlands are finally recognized as the backbone of sustainability, she added.\n\nYan Zhen, deputy head of Chinas National Forestry and Grassland Administration, noted that in recent years, China has continuously improved its legal and institutional framework for wetland conservation, comprehensively protected wetland ecosystems, and actively engaged in international cooperation, continuously contributing to global wetland protection efforts.\n\nThe Chinese delegation said they will engage in open dialogue to share experiences and build consensus with all contracting parties to help produce meaningful and impactful outcomes from the conference.\n\n",

Sorry for the outage.SpaceXwill remedy root cause to ensure it doesnt happen again, the SpaceX CEO wrote on X.\n\nThe outage was a rare hiccup for SpaceXs most commercially sensitive business that had experts speculating whether the service, known for its resilience and rapid growth, had been beset by a glitch, a botched software update or even a cyber-attack.\n\nDoug Madory, an expert at the internet analysis firm Kentik, said the outage was global and that such a sweeping interruption was unusual.\n\nThis is likely the longest outage ever for Starlink, at least while it became a major service provider, Madory said.\n\nAs Starlink has gained more users, SpaceX has focused heavily in recent months on updating its network to accommodate demands for higher speed and bandwidth.\n\nThe company, in a partnership with T-Mobile, is also expanding the constellation with larger, more powerful satellites to offer direct-to-cell text-messaging services, a line of business in which mobile phone users can send emergency text messages through the network in rural areas.\n\nSpaceX has launched more than 8,000 Starlink satellites since 2020, building a uniquely distributed network in low Earth orbit that has attracted intense demand from militaries, transportation industries and consumers in rural areas with poor access to traditional, fiber-based internet.\n\nId speculate this is a bad software update, not entirely dissimilar to the CrowdStrike mess with Windows last year, or a cyber-attack, said Gregory Falco, director of a space and cybersecurity laboratory at Cornell University.\n\nAn update to CrowdStrikes widely used cybersecurity software led to worldwide flight cancellations and affected industries around the globe in July last year. The outage disrupted internet services, affecting 8.5 million Microsoft Windows devices.\n\nIt was unclear whether Thursdays outage affected SpaceXs other satellite-based services that rely on the Starlink network. Starshield, the companys military satellite business unit, has billions of dollars worth of contracts with the Pentagon and US intelligence agencies.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nJournalist Edmund Kudzayi has formally requested the High Court to rescind a default judgment that awarded US$100,000 in damages to top lawyer Fadzayi Mahere in a defamation case.\n\nThe case stemmed from allegations by the Kukurigo owner that Mahere was dating a married businessman, Tinashe Murapata which had caused the collapse of his marriage.\n\nKudzayi argues that the judgment was issued without proper legal procedure, and he claims a bona fide defense against the allegations made by Mahere.\n\nKudzayi, through his legal representatives at Gunje Legal Practice in Harare, stated that he was neither in wilful default nor was he given adequate opportunity to present his defense.\n\nThe default judgment, which was granted on July 10, 2025, arose from a civil claim filed by Mahere in case number HC3060/22.\n\nThe crux of Kudzayis argument rests on a series of procedural irregularities.\n\nHe said the case had previously been struck off the court roll due to Maheres failure to prosecute, alleging further that her claims regarding the status of the case were misrepresented to the court.\n\nAt all material times, I have been participating in the matter, filing all papers on time, demonstrating my desire to have my defense ventilated and vindicated in open court, Kudzayi stated.\n\nKudzayi also contends that he was obstructed from attending a crucial hearing due to security restrictions at the High Court, an incident he claims was acknowledged by both Mahere and her legal representatives.\n\nIt is his argument that this obstruction led to his defense being struck off without his knowledge or the proper legal foundation.\n\nMy defence was struck out and the matter placed on the unopposed my knowledge, apparently without a formal application (I certainly one on the consolidated record) after a hearing on 24 March 2025 before Hon Justice Wamambo, a hearing I was obstructed from attending by High Court security even though I was in the High Court building.\n\nThe fact that I was obstructed from attending the hearing by security at the High Court is known to the Court and the Defendant and her legal practitioners who, as officers of the Court, would have known that I was not in wilful default and should not have chosen to snatch at a judgment but sought to have the matter heard on the merits.\n\nEven if the judgment is rescinded and the matter is set back to where it was, I have reasonable grounds for success in the main action, he said.\n\nIn his application, Kudzayi also said that Maheres claims are not only unfounded but also benefit from an exaggerated damages award.\n\nHe draws attention to previous defamation judgments in Zimbabwe, noting that the US$100,000 award is unprecedented and significantly higher than any earlier awards, including Maheres own cases, where damages did not exceed US$18,000.\n\nHe said, Fraud vitiates everything, highlighting what he describes as misleading representations made by Mahere during the reinstatement process.\n\nEven if I am found to have been in wilful default or go on to lose the main action, this judgment must still be rescinded on the basis that it was erroneously granted as no court in Zimbabwe would award the quantum of damages awarded to the respondent as it is so extraordinary as to constitute a manifest injustice, he said.\n\nThe defamation claim itself revolves around Kudzayis allegations of Maheres extramarital affair, which he argues serves the public interest.\n\nHis legal team insists that Mahere cannot substantiate her claims without proper cross-examination and that the judgments value is disproportionate to the alleged damages.\n\nKudzayis application for rescission also focuses on the implications of allowing the judgment to stand.\n\nHe argues that the case has spiralled into a deliberate and calculated deception, undermining the integrity of the judicial process.\n\nThe matter is yet to be heard.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nDeputy Finance Minister David Mnangagwa has said the Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill represents a bold step toward equitable economic reform, insisting Zimbabwes vast mineral wealth must uplift all citizens, not only a privileged minority.\n\nSpeaking Wednesday at a meeting with Zanu PF youths, government, and party officials at the partys headquarters, Mnangagwa said the long-awaited Bill offers a blueprint for a more inclusive and transparent mining sector.\n\nAmong the attendees were Youth Minister Tino Machakaire and Zanu PF National Political Commissar Munyaradzi Machacha. The gathering deliberated on the far-reaching provisions of the Bill.\n\nFrom the Ministry of Finances perspective, this Bill presents an opportunity not only to modernise the countrys mining governance framework, but also to lay the foundation for a more inclusive, transparent, and fiscally sustainable mining economy, Mnangagwa said.\n\nHe added that the ministry was particularly encouraged by the deliberate and progressive fiscal support mechanisms embedded in the Bill,provisions he said would attract new investment, improve compliance, and ensure Zimbabweans benefit fully from their mineral resources.\n\nZimbabwes mining sector, according to Mnangagwa, contributes over 60% of export earnings and nearly 13% of the national GDP. It directly and indirectly employs hundreds of thousands and is a key pillar in the countrys drive toward attaining Vision 2030.\n\nHowever, he lamented that outdated regulations, opaque licensing systems, and weak institutional coordination had long stifled growth in the sector.\n\nThe Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill responds directly to these challenges by introducing a robust and transparent framework that enables better fiscal planning, incentivises investment, and enhances accountability in the exploitation of mineral resources, he said.\n\nThe meeting also featured open dialogue with youths, who raised concerns over limited access to information and markets.\n\nRobert Togarepi, a youth from Gutu, highlighted the lack of resources available to young people seeking to participate in the mining sector. Meanwhile, Kumbirai Maunganidze from Harare expressed frustration over the absence of domestic markets for semi-precious stones.\n\nWe have vast amounts of semi-precious minerals, but theres no market for them in Zimbabwe. How can we be assisted to market these special stones, other than just gold? Maunganidze asked.\n\nIn response, Mnangagwa reaffirmed the ministrys commitment to implementing the fiscal tools in the Bill with diligence, integrity, and accountability.\n\nWe believe the Bill strikes the right balance between encouraging investment and ensuring that the State and citizens receive their fair share of the value extracted from our natural resources, he said.\n\nNotably, the Bill promotes local value addition by offering a full rebate on royalties for minerals used entirely within Zimbabwe. It also mandates the publication of mining contracts and revenue data, a move aligned with global best practices under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).\n\nMnangagwa stressed that legislation alone is insufficient. He said the government was also rolling out complementary policy and institutional reforms, including the deployment of digital systems to enable real-time monitoring of mineral production and revenue flows.\n\n",

Several mining operations in the continent have been seized or disrupted due to disputes with governments over taxes and investments, such as Barrick Mining Corps Loulo-Gounkoto gold complex in Mali. In Zimbabwe, the central banks retention of hard currency from exporters has been one of the challenges faced by producers.\n\nOrleyn told Bloomberg on the sidelines of the ceremony that the company has raised concerns about the countrys currency volatility with the Zimbabwean authorities.\n\nThere is a sense that this is a long-term relationship and the currency volatility in a geopolitical environment as we are facing at the moment is something to be expected, she said\n\nThe Southern African nation has the worlds third-largest platinum reserves after Russia and South Africa.\n\nZimbabwe generates more than half of its revenues from exports of minerals including gold, chrome and diamonds.\n\n",
