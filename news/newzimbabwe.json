            "content": "By Tapiwa Svondo\n\nNEW Marlborough residents have spoken out after a primary school pupil was attacked by three dogs, with previous incidents reportedly going unaddressed.\n\nThe pupil, identified only as Denzel, is currently at Harare Hospital receiving treatment for injuries to his stomach, throat, and head after he was attacked by two Boerboels and one Rottweiler last Monday. The boy was on his way to school when he was attacked at the intersection of Musasa and Mapereke roads in New Marlborough.\n\nThis incident comes just three weeks after the death of Samuel Machara, who was fatally attacked by a Pitbull in Bluffhill, only five kilometres from New Marlborough.\n\nIn an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Matthew Chifamba, a neighbour of the dogs owner, said the canines have long been a nuisance and have since destroyed the perimeter wall which separates their households.\n\nOur kitchen door faces the perimeter wall. Sometimes when we open the door, they just start barking at us, and they bulldozed our durawall.\n\nWe have tried to engage with him (dog owner) but it seems he is not bothered by our concerns.\n\nChifamba called for the dogs to be euthanised.\n\nNow things have escalated to this attack on the child, and to move forward, these dogs should be put down, he said.\n\nAucious Mubvumbi added that the community is no longer safe as there are a lot of stray and unattended dogs in the area.\n\nMarlborough is now full of stray dogs. Usually, there is a pack of six dogs which roam around in the evening, said Mubvumbi.\n\nMeanwhile, the killer Pitbull owner, Mike Mupinga, was on Tuesday denied bail by Harare Magistrate Marewanazvo Gofa.\n\n",
