            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nCONTROVERSIAL Zimdancehall artist Jimmy Mudereri, also known as Silent Killer who is facing a US$122,000 lawsuit for alleged breach of contract, is adamant he does owe anyone an apology.\n\nMusic promotions company, Y2K Entertainment, the organisers of the UK SAMA Festival, recently issued a letter of demand to the Mbare-born artist after he failed to attend a gig scheduled for April 2025.\n\nSilent Killer missed the festival after refusing to board a flight, citing a troubling dream about an airplane explosion.\n\nDespite checking in at Robert Mugabe International Airport, he backed out at the last minute, prompting the organisers to buy a second flight ticket costing $1,500, but he locked himself in a toilet to avoid flying.\n\nY2K Entertainment claims Silent Killer breached his performance contract, resulting in significant financial losses and reputational damage which has now led them to send a letter of demand for a total amount of US$122,170, within seven days.\n\nIn an interview with ZimboLive, Silent Killer, said he doesnt owe anyone an apology.\n\nI dont owe anybody an apology. I am asking for an apology from them because somehow I think that they think that the law works for them or belongs to them. Even I can be protected by the law. If its a crime, a magistrate is going to determine that. The law is going to determine that, said a defiant Silent Killer.\n\nHe went on to warn that he is under the protection of Prophet Walter Magaya if they dare to poke him.\n\nI read that letter and I cant say sorry that I was the one who leaked. The letter was sent to my lawyers, this is between the lawyers. Remember Im the son of Prophet Magaya, so whatever you plan on me, rains will pour, said Silent Killer.\n\nIn the letter of demand, Y2K Entertainment alleges that they incurred substantial expenses, including cost of three airfare tickets and various payments made to facilitate his travel and Visa application.\n\nWe are instructed by our client to demand, as we hereby do; that you pay the sum of USD122, 170 (One hundred and twenty-two thousand one hundred and seventy United States Dollars) which amount is now due to our client and must be paid within seven (7) days of being served with this letter.\n\nYou are also further expected to pay US$12, 217 (Twelve thousand two hundred and seventeen United States dollars) being our collection commission, reads part of the letter.\n\n",

            "content": "Hydroponics has revolutionized gardening and farming by eliminating the need for soil, allowing plants to grow faster, healthier, and more efficiently. At the heart of every successful hydroponic system lies a critical factor: hydroponic nutrients. These nutrient solutions are the life source for plants, replacing the traditional minerals and organic matter found in soil.\n\nUnderstanding hydroponic nutrients  how they work, how to manage them, and how to optimize their use  is key to achieving strong yields and healthy plants. Whether youre just starting with hydroponics or scaling up to a commercial setup, mastering nutrients is a must.\n\nIn hydroponic systems, plants depend entirely on the grower for their nutritional needs. Unlike traditional farming, where soil acts as a buffer and nutrient reservoir, hydroponics delivers nutrients directly through water. This direct delivery means plants absorb essential elements faster and more efficiently, leading to faster growth cycles andbigger harvests.\n\nHydroponic nutrients include a mix of macronutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), along with secondary elements such as calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. Trace minerals like iron, manganese, boron, and zinc are equally vital, supporting photosynthesis, cell structure, and root development.\n\nBy precisely controlling nutrient levels, growers can tailor feeding schedules to each plants growth stage, dramatically improving outcomes.\n\nNot all nutrient solutions are created equal. Some are designed for general use, while others are tailored for specific crops like leafy greens, herbs, or fruiting plants. The choice of nutrients also depends on the type of hydroponic system being used  for instance, deep water culture (DWC) systems often need slightly different nutrient balances than drip irrigation setups.\n\nBeginners often start withpre-formulated hydroponic nutrients, which offer balanced profiles for a range of plants. Advanced growers might customize their own blends to fine-tune nutrient delivery. Monitoring factors like electrical conductivity (EC) and pH ensures that plants are receiving exactly what they need without risking deficiencies or toxicities.\n\nGrowers serious about optimizing their setups often turn to top hydroponic nutrient techniques to maintain peak system performance and avoid common pitfalls.\n\nStarting with hydroponic nutrients can seem overwhelming at first, but it becomes second nature with practice. Beginners should focus on understanding three key aspects: nutrient types, concentration levels, and pH control.\n\nPre-mixed nutrient solutions specifically formulated for beginners offer a reliable starting point. Many are labeled according to plant type or growth stage (vegetative vs flowering), making selection easier. Monitoring pH is equally important, as incorrect levels can lock nutrients out, even if they are present in the solution.\n\nTo simplify the learning curve, new growers can explore guides likehydroponic nutrients for beginners, where step-by-step instructions make it easy to avoid mistakes and build strong foundational skills.\n\nMastering the basics early ensures a smoother, more productive journey into the world of hydroponic gardening.\n\nSuccessful hydroponic gardening doesnt stop at adding nutrients to water; it requires consistent monitoring and adjustments. EC meters and pH testing kits are essential tools for keeping nutrient solutions within the ideal range.\n\nAs plants absorb nutrients and water evaporates, concentrations can fluctuate. Without careful monitoring, plants may face nutrient deficiencies, stunted growth, or salt buildup in the system. Regularly checking solution strength, topping off water levels, and flushing systems, when necessary, ensures a stable environment for roots to thrive.\n\nAutomated nutrient dosing systems are becoming increasingly popular, especially for larger or commercial hydroponic operations. These smart systems help maintain ideal conditions with minimal manual effort.\n\nIncorporating hydroponic nutrient balance strategies into regular garden management improves long-term success and plant vitality.\n\nEven experienced growers can make errors when it comes to nutrients. Overfeeding, underfeeding, or failing to monitor pH can all lead to disappointing harvests. Recognizing the signs of imbalance  such as yellowing leaves, slow growth, or nutrient burn  is critical for quick intervention.\n\nOne useful strategy is implementing a simple feeding chart and adjusting based on plant response rather than blindly following general schedules. Also, regularly cleaning and sterilizing equipment prevents salt buildup and contamination, two often-overlooked nutrient management issues.\n\nHydroponic success isnt about having perfect systems from the start; its about observing plants, learning from each cycle, and refining techniques over time.\n\nTechnology is transforming how growers manage nutrients. Innovations like real-time nutrient monitors, AI-assisted dosing systems, and environmentally friendly nutrient sources are making hydroponic gardening more sustainable and scalable.\n\nAs hydroponic systems become smarter and more automated, the growers role evolves into that of a manager and optimizer. Learning hydroponic nutrient fundamentals today sets gardeners up for long-term success as these technologies become more widespread.\n\nBy understanding and mastering hydroponic nutrients now, growers position themselves at the forefront of a greener, smarter future for agriculture and food production.\n\n",

            "content": "By Cricinfo\n\nBEN Duckett brought up his fifth Test hundred and first at his home ground at exactly a run ball. Zak Crawley got a first Test century since July 2023, 28 innings ago. Between them, they shared in Englands highest-opening stand at home since 1960.\n\nOllie Pope added the trimmings with his third hundred in as many Tests at Trent Bridge and eighth against as many different oppositions and England scored the most runs on the first day of a Test in England. If that reads like all-out dominance, it was.It was also a rude welcome for Zimbabwes XI, none of whom had played a Test in England before, and many of whom will not remember the last time their team were in the country 22 years ago.After Craig Ervine chose to bowl first under cloudy skies, Zimbabwes four-seam, single-spinner attack struggled for consistency and were hurt by the loss of one of their cogs for most of the day.Opening bowler Richard Ngarava left the field ten minutes into the second session with what was later confirmed to be a back spasm. He returned an hour and five minutes into the third, with a ginger step. He fielded for a few minutes but was soon back in the dressing room, which limited his days work to nine overs in the morning.Premier seamer Blessing Muzarabani, who was also the most threatening of the quicks, bowled 20 overs while Sikandar Raza delivered 24 overs but little Zimbabwe tried hurt England. The hosts top-order batted with exactly the right mix of caution and aggression, though the scoring rate of 5.66 would suggest only the latter.Duckett and Crawley started with some circumspection and the first six overs brought just 19 runs. But that was as good as it got for Zimbabwe as boundaries came soon after, and regularly.Crawley announced himself with a cracking drive through the covers, which was followed by Duckett taking on Muzarabani off the front and back foot. After 10 overs, Ervine made his first change and introduced Tanaka Chivanga, whose opening over cost 12.Chivanga was the only one to find some swing and Duckett had a nervy moment when he miscued a drive into the off side but there was no fielder close enough to attempt a catch.Duckett lashed the next ball over the slips and to the boundary to bring up fifty off 47 balls. Crawleys fifty came in Victor Nyauchis first over, when he whipped the ball through square leg and ran a comfortable two, and England went to lunch on 130 for 0.Zimbabwe thought they had some luck in the over after the break when Nyauchi, from around the wicket, believed he had found Ducketts edge. It turned out to be a flick of his jumper. At the end of that over, Duckett edged Nyauchi between wide slip and gully and moved into the 80s. He reverse-swept and cut Raza to enter the 90s and then worked him square for a single to bring up his century.Still, Zimbabwes hopes of seeing the back of Duckett were kept alive. On 104, he popped Nyauchi a return chance but the ball fell short. And then Duckett went full throttle. He cut Chivanga over cover point and pulled him over deep backward square for the first six of the match, and seemed unstoppable.With Duckett on 130 and Zimbabwe all but out of options, Wessly Madhevere was brought on and immediately hit for four through the covers and then launched over midwicket for six.Against the run of play, Duckett hit Madheveres next ball straight to Ben Curran at cover and could not believe what he had done. He trudged off as Zimbabwe enjoyed their first smiles of the day, only to look up and see Pope.In the first 18 balls he faced, Pope hit six fours, a sign of what was to come. By tea, Pope was on 49 off 46 balls. Crawley, content with the supporting act, had worked his way to 93.Popes fifty came two balls into the third session and he had reached 61 when Crawley got a leading edge off Nyauchi and ran the single that took him to three figures. His sedate celebration seemed to spell relief, not jubilation, and could quieten criticism ahead of sterner challenges to follow. He added 24 more runs before missing a sweep against Raza, to be given out lbw. Crawley reviewed but replays showed it was hitting leg stump.Popes charge continued undeterred with an array of strokes all around the ground and his hundred came up with a cut. It marked the eighth different opponent he had scored a century against. The milestones kept coming as Joe Root became the fifth player to score 13,000 Test runs and the numbers may have made Zimbabwe giddy.They took the second new-ball as soon as it became available and it only gave England more scoring opportunities. Root hit the first delivery for four, then Pope took two more fours off a tiring Muzarabanis 17th over (and ensured he conceded 100) to reach 150.To add insult to injury he followed an Nyauchi inswinger and helped it over fine leg, which meant England had scored 22 runs off seven deliveries. It did not all go their way, however. Muzarabani finally had some reward when he sent down a surprise bouncer and Root top-edged to Sean Williams at fine leg.That was as much reward as Zimbabwe got as Pope and Harry Brook batted out the rest of the day to finish two short of 500. Pope was unbeaten on 169 off 163 balls.\n\nOllie Pope added the trimmings with his third hundred in as many Tests at Trent Bridge and eighth against as many different oppositions and England scored the most runs on the first day of a Test in England.

Pope was unbeaten on 169 off 163 balls.\n\nIt was also a rude welcome for Zimbabwes XI, none of whom had played a Test in England before, and many of whom will not remember the last time their team were in the country 22 years ago.\n\nAfter Craig Ervine chose to bowl first under cloudy skies, Zimbabwes four-seam, single-spinner attack struggled for consistency and were hurt by the loss of one of their cogs for most of the day.Opening bowler Richard Ngarava left the field ten minutes into the second session with what was later confirmed to be a back spasm. He returned an hour and five minutes into the third, with a ginger step. He fielded for a few minutes but was soon back in the dressing room, which limited his days work to nine overs in the morning.Premier seamer Blessing Muzarabani, who was also the most threatening of the quicks, bowled 20 overs while Sikandar Raza delivered 24 overs but little Zimbabwe tried hurt England. The hosts top-order batted with exactly the right mix of caution and aggression, though the scoring rate of 5.66 would suggest only the latter.Duckett and Crawley started with some circumspection and the first six overs brought just 19 runs. But that was as good as it got for Zimbabwe as boundaries came soon after, and regularly.Crawley announced himself with a cracking drive through the covers, which was followed by Duckett taking on Muzarabani off the front and back foot. After 10 overs, Ervine made his first change and introduced Tanaka Chivanga, whose opening over cost 12.Chivanga was the only one to find some swing and Duckett had a nervy moment when he miscued a drive into the off side but there was no fielder close enough to attempt a catch.Duckett lashed the next ball over the slips and to the boundary to bring up fifty off 47 balls. Crawleys fifty came in Victor Nyauchis first over, when he whipped the ball through square leg and ran a comfortable two, and England went to lunch on 130 for 0.Zimbabwe thought they had some luck in the over after the break when Nyauchi, from around the wicket, believed he had found Ducketts edge. It turned out to be a flick of his jumper. At the end of that over, Duckett edged Nyauchi between wide slip and gully and moved into the 80s. He reverse-swept and cut Raza to enter the 90s and then worked him square for a single to bring up his century.Still, Zimbabwes hopes of seeing the back of Duckett were kept alive. On 104, he popped Nyauchi a return chance but the ball fell short. And then Duckett went full throttle. He cut Chivanga over cover point and pulled him over deep backward square for the first six of the match, and seemed unstoppable.With Duckett on 130 and Zimbabwe all but out of options, Wessly Madhevere was brought on and immediately hit for four through the covers and then launched over midwicket for six.Against the run of play, Duckett hit Madheveres next ball straight to Ben Curran at cover and could not believe what he had done. He trudged off as Zimbabwe enjoyed their first smiles of the day, only to look up and see Pope.In the first 18 balls he faced, Pope hit six fours, a sign of what was to come. By tea, Pope was on 49 off 46 balls. Crawley, content with the supporting act, had worked his way to 93.Popes fifty came two balls into the third session and he had reached 61 when Crawley got a leading edge off Nyauchi and ran the single that took him to three figures. His sedate celebration seemed to spell relief, not jubilation, and could quieten criticism ahead of sterner challenges to follow. He added 24 more runs before missing a sweep against Raza, to be given out lbw. Crawley reviewed but replays showed it was hitting leg stump.Popes charge continued undeterred with an array of strokes all around the ground and his hundred came up with a cut. It marked the eighth different opponent he had scored a century against. The milestones kept coming as Joe Root became the fifth player to score 13,000 Test runs and the numbers may have made Zimbabwe giddy.They took the second new-ball as soon as it became available and it only gave England more scoring opportunities. Root hit the first delivery for four, then Pope took two more fours off a tiring Muzarabanis 17th over (and ensured he conceded 100) to reach 150.To add insult to injury he followed an Nyauchi inswinger and helped it over fine leg, which meant England had scored 22 runs off seven deliveries.

Crawley reviewed but replays showed it was hitting leg stump.Popes charge continued undeterred with an array of strokes all around the ground and his hundred came up with a cut. It marked the eighth different opponent he had scored a century against. The milestones kept coming as Joe Root became the fifth player to score 13,000 Test runs and the numbers may have made Zimbabwe giddy.They took the second new-ball as soon as it became available and it only gave England more scoring opportunities. Root hit the first delivery for four, then Pope took two more fours off a tiring Muzarabanis 17th over (and ensured he conceded 100) to reach 150.To add insult to injury he followed an Nyauchi inswinger and helped it over fine leg, which meant England had scored 22 runs off seven deliveries. It did not all go their way, however. Muzarabani finally had some reward when he sent down a surprise bouncer and Root top-edged to Sean Williams at fine leg.That was as much reward as Zimbabwe got as Pope and Harry Brook batted out the rest of the day to finish two short of 500. Pope was unbeaten on 169 off 163 balls.\n\nStill, Zimbabwes hopes of seeing the back of Duckett were kept alive. On 104, he popped Nyauchi a return chance but the ball fell short. And then Duckett went full throttle. He cut Chivanga over cover point and pulled him over deep backward square for the first six of the match, and seemed unstoppable.\n\nWith Duckett on 130 and Zimbabwe all but out of options, Wessly Madhevere was brought on and immediately hit for four through the covers and then launched over midwicket for six.Against the run of play, Duckett hit Madheveres next ball straight to Ben Curran at cover and could not believe what he had done. He trudged off as Zimbabwe enjoyed their first smiles of the day, only to look up and see Pope.In the first 18 balls he faced, Pope hit six fours, a sign of what was to come. By tea, Pope was on 49 off 46 balls. Crawley, content with the supporting act, had worked his way to 93.Popes fifty came two balls into the third session and he had reached 61 when Crawley got a leading edge off Nyauchi and ran the single that took him to three figures.

            "content": "By Newzwire\n\nKARO Platinum has completed earthworks at its new mine in Ngezi and is in advanced talks to raise an additional $165 million to complete the project, which has faced significant delays due to low platinum prices.\n\nManaging Director Bernard Pryor says the company has so far spent $140 million on developing the mine, which will be Zimbabwes third-largest platinum producer upon completion.Earthworks are always challenging, but weve completed them to 100%, Pryor said during a call with analysts on Thursday.The project will have a 132 kV powerline, while the Chirundazi Dam has been built to supply water.Its a big project, but everything that we need is in close proximity, he added.Karo has opened a tender for a mining contract to begin stripping overburden and prepare for mining.This is a large contract; we need a highly competent mining contract to move an extensive amount of material, some 1.41.5 million BCM (bank cubic metres) per month, said Pryor.On funding, Tharisa Financial Director Andrew Henwood says: We are in advanced talks with a lending syndicate, South African and African banks. We are targeting $165 million of that funding.Karo has already raised $37 million through a bond on the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange and may extend the facility. It may also raise between $50 million and $100 million through a gold streaming agreement, where a buyer provides upfront capital for a share of gold produced as a by-product.As far as the timing is concerned, we are looking at first ore in mill starting 15 months after we close the fundraising, Henwood said.Sitting on the Great Dyke, Karo will include a 10-year open-pit phase and a 30-year underground mine, producing 226,000 ounces annuallybehind Zimplats (646,000 oz) and Unki (244,000 oz).Karo had hoped to complete the mine in 2024, but had to push back timelines due to the collapse in global platinum prices, which has stalled investment across the industry.Phoevos Pouroulis, CEO of Tharisa, said: While we have slowed development at the Karo Platinum Project in line with capital availability, we have nevertheless continued work on infrastructure, water dams and further optimisations including commencing with studies for the future underground mine development, while presenting the opportunity to non-traditional financiers, who like us, see the long-term benefits of the uniqueness not only of this Tier 1 project but of the applications PGMs will play for decades to come.The Zimbabwe government has a free 15% stake in the mine, and has an option to buy a further 11%.\n\nManaging Director Bernard Pryor says the company has so far spent $140 million on developing the mine, which will be Zimbabwes third-largest platinum producer upon completion.\n\nEarthworks are always challenging, but weve completed them to 100%, Pryor said during a call with analysts on Thursday.The project will have a 132 kV powerline, while the Chirundazi Dam has been built to supply water.Its a big project, but everything that we need is in close proximity, he added.Karo has opened a tender for a mining contract to begin stripping overburden and prepare for mining.This is a large contract; we need a highly competent mining contract to move an extensive amount of material, some 1.41.5 million BCM (bank cubic metres) per month, said Pryor.On funding, Tharisa Financial Director Andrew Henwood says: We are in advanced talks with a lending syndicate, South African and African banks.
