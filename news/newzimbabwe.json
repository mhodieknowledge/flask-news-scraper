Offenders will face harsh penalties, including imprisonment and lifetime driving bans.\n\nPublic safety comes first. Every reckless driver is a potential killer on our roads, the NPA noted.\n\n",

            "content": "By James Muonwa\n\nCHINHOYI University of Technology (CUT) has achieved gender parity in the number of graduands churned out of the Class of 2025, amid a shift that witnessed more females than males graduating.\n\nDuring the universitys 21st graduation ceremony held on Thursday, a total of 3,130 graduands were capped by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is the Chancellor of all State universities.\n\nOf the graduating Class of 2025, there were 1,573 females and 1,557 males, marking a slight difference of 16.\n\nTraditionally, during previous graduation ceremonies, the number of male graduates surpassed that of females.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the event held at CUT Grounds, womens rights lobbyist, Chioniso Gurupira, said the new trend was a positive sign of strides the country has made in empowering women and the girl-child.\n\nThe one thing that has probably struck some of us in the gender mainstreaming sector is the number of female graduands at this event. The women are slightly more than the men, which is a positive story of CUT having achieved gender parity, said Gurupira.\n\nGender parity refers to a situation where the number of females and males is roughly equal or balanced in a particular context, such as in education, the workforce, or leadership roles.\n\nIt implies equal representation, opportunities, and treatment of both genders.\n\nA female graduand, Jennifer Tinotenda Sanjobo, who graduated with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Crop Science, expressed joy at having successfully completed her degree in a previously male-dominated study area, which will enable her to contribute meaningfully to national development.\n\nI am excited to have graduated with a BSc in Crop Science. We were a few ladies in our cohort and l feel proud to be among the graduands, said Sanjobo.\n\nI am hoping to use my newly acquired education and expertise to help Zimbabwe fight climate change by coming up with seed varieties that can adapt and withstand the rigours of the phenomenon.\n\nIn a small way, I am optimistic my contribution to climate-proofing agriculture will bring about food security and national development, she added.\n\nWhile CUT has managed to bring an equilibrium between the number of graduates based on gender, sadly total number of graduands tumbled this year to 3,130 from the 2024 figure, which stood at 3,545. In 2023, a total of 3,480 graduated from the same university.\n\nAddressing guests, CUT Vice Chancellor, Professor David Simbi lamented the low uptake of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses, which are the varsitys anchor areas of study.\n\nOur understanding as a higher education institution of our role is using research, innovation, science and technology development to drive and develop the industrialisation and modernisation of Zimbabwe to achieve a middle economic status by 2030\n\nHowever, our human capital development remains side lobbed in that there are too few STEM students in our programmes, despite the importance we attach to the related programmes of study, said Simbi.\n\nThis is, however, not peculiar to Zimbabwe, and there are other routes that we can use to meet this deficit that other countries with similar problems have adopted.\n\nTo this end, Your Excellency and Chancellor, CUT will be seriously investigating the introduction of foundation programmes in science, technology and engineering as pre-university basic technology education.\n\nSimbi noted that the approach is a common trend in the United Kingdom, Singapore and Malaysia, among other countries.\n\nThe vice chancellor also lamented the high cost of laboratory equipment, which he, however, said could be dealt with by adopting reverse engineering.\n\nSimbi told graduands that the Heritage-Based Education 5.0 philosophy had prepared them for the future.\n\nHeritage-based education has prepared you for the future. To the private sector, these graduates are ready to take on any challenge for the good of the country. In broader contribution, heritage-based education has gained greater meaning in the nation and beyond, towards industrialisation and modernisation, Simbi said.\n\n",

            "content": "FAO\n\nAt the 13th Annual National Agribusiness Conference, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) re-affirmed its role as a key technical partner in building resilient, market-driven horticultural value chains, supporting Zimbabwes Vision 2030 through infrastructure development, standards compliance, and climate-smart agriculture.\n\nThe conference held during the Zimbabwe Agricultural Show, convened senior government officials, agribusiness leaders, development partners, and farmers under the themeBuilding Resilient and Market-Driven Horticultural Value Chains.\n\nRepresenting the United Nations in Zimbabwe, FAO Subregional Coordinator for Southern Africa and Representative to Zimbabwe, Patrice Talla delivered remarks on behalf of UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Edward Kallon, emphasizing the alignment of the conferences objectives with the Zimbabwe UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework.\n\nThe UN Cooperation Framework is our collective blueprint for supporting Zimbabwes development aspirations. Building resilient and market-driven horticultural value chains is not just an agricultural goal, it is a pathway to inclusive economic growth, food security, and climate resilience, said Mr. Edward Kallon.\n\nWe commend the Government of Zimbabwe for its leadership and re-affirm the UNs commitment. Our support to the Government and people of Zimbabwe will continue to be guided by the current Zimbabwe UN Cooperation Framework (2022-2026) aligned with the NDS-I, and in the next Cooperation Framework, whose roadmap is in progress for 2027-2030 to complement NDS-II. Working hand-in-hand with national stakeholders, we shall deliver for Zimbabwe on Vision 2030 to become upper middle-income society and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, added Mr. Kallon.\n\nHorticulture is emerging as a cornerstone of Zimbabwes export strategy, contributing over USD 120 million annually through high-value crops such as blueberries, citrus, macadamia, and cut flowers. With the government targeting a USD 2.5 billion horticulture industry by 2030, the sector is poised for rapid expansion. Stakeholders attending the ANAC acknowledged that unlocking this potential requires strategic partnerships, coordinated investment, compliance with international standards and access to finance complemented by robust market intelligence.\n\nFAOs interventions in Zimbabwe are directly addressing these needs by playing a central role in shaping resilient and market-responsive value chains. Through strategic investments in infrastructure, food safety, digital extension, and climate-smart practices, FAO is supporting producers to meet global standards and unlock export potential. FAOs commitment to inclusive financing and good agricultural practices underscores its leadership in transforming horticulture into a driver of sustainable growth and rural empowerment. FAO has also facilitated the establishment of a USD 6.2 million Seed Revolving Fund managed by AFC Land and Development Bank funded by the African Development Bank.\n\nFAO is proud to be the lead technical agency supporting agrifood systems transformation in Zimbabwe. FAOs mandate is rooted in empowering producers, especially women and youth, with the tools and knowledge to thrive in competitive markets. Through strategic partnerships and innovation, we are helping Zimbabwe build a horticulture sector that is resilient, inclusive, and globally recognized, said Talla.\n\nThe conference highlighted the importance of regional integration, with the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) offering new opportunities for intra-African trade. FAOs upgrading of human health laboratories is enhancing pest and disease surveillance and food safety testing, critical components for accessing regional and international markets.\n\nAllow me to reaffirm Governments unwavering commitment to the agricultural sector. Together we are turning challenges into opportunities, policies into action, aspirations into reality. May this conference inspire new partnerships, practical solutions, and bold investments that will sustain Zimbabwes agricultural renaissance, said Honourable Vice President of Zimbabwe, Dr. CGDN Chiwenga in a keynote address read on his behalf by the Minister of Defence, Honourable Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri.\n\nThe 13th ANAC concluded with a call for bold leadership, coordinated action, and sustained partnerships. FAO reaffirmed its commitment to walking alongside Zimbabwe on its journey toward a resilient, market-driven horticulture industry that uplifts rural livelihoods and strengthening the national agriculture economy.\n\n",

His songZimbabwerang through the air as a newly free nation celebrated the end of colonial rule. But the story behind the song goes deepershaped by Marleys connection to Africa, the liberation struggle, and a few musical friends in Ethiopia.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Marley frequently visited Ethiopia, drawn by his Rastafarian beliefs and support for African unity. During one visit toAddis Ababa, he was introduced to a group of African musicians working for the United Nations. One of them was a Zimbabwean jazz musician and poet who had formed a band calledThe United Nations Jazz Band. They werent reggae artists, but Marley took interest in their talent and their roots.\n\nThe band and Marley developed a musical friendship. Though coming from different genres, they began to experiment with blending Marleys reggae style with traditional African rhythms. One day, Marley shared that he had been working on a song about Zimbabwes independence. He believed freedom for the country was near and wanted to create something special to support that moment.\n\nThe musicians helped shape the song, bringing in African influencesespecially Shona soundsand Marley welcomed their input. The result wasZimbabwe, a track filled with powerful lyrics like,Every man got a right to decide his own destiny.It was included in Marleys 1979 albumSurvival, which carried strong messages of resistance and African liberation.\n\nWhen Zimbabwes independence was officially declared in April 1980, Marley was invited to perform at the celebration. The new government couldnt afford to pay him, but Marley didnt hesitate. He paid for everything himself, including flying in his band and sound equipment fromLondon.\n\nThat night at Rufaro Stadium, 40,000 people gathered, including world leaders like Prince Charles and Indira Gandhi. As Marley performedZimbabwe, thousands more tried to enter the stadium, and police used tear gas to control the crowd. Still, Marley stayed on stage and kept singing. His commitment to the people never wavered. To make up for those who couldnt see the first concert, he performed again the following nightthis time for over 100,000 people.\n\nMarleys presence meant more than entertainment. He stood with Zimbabwe at a turning point in its history. His performance wasnt just a showit was a statement of unity, freedom, and African pride. His song had become the unofficial anthem of Zimbabwes struggle and victory.\n\nEven after Marleys death in 1981,Zimbabweremains one of his most powerful and politically significant songs. It symbolizes not only a nations independence but also the power of music to inspire and unite people across borders.\n\nFor Zimbabweans, Marleys gift was unforgettablea reggae anthem that echoed their journey, struggles, and hope for the future.\n\n",
