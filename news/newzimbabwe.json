follows the graduation with drone pilot certificates of a cohort of 27 police officer in Harare this Wednesday after successfully undergoing rigorous training.National police spokesperson, Commissioner Paul Nyathi said the event underscored ZRPs commitment to modernising policing and keeping abreast with international best standards and protocols.As the ZRP continues to embrace technology in policing, 27 police officers graduated with drone pilot certificates at ZRP Sports Club this afternoon, Nyathi said in a statement Wednesday.The CommissionerGeneral of Polices thrust of modernising the ZRP through the Electronic Traffic Management System and use of technology in crime management is certainly taking effect, he added.Drones are a game-changer in combating crime as they can be deployed in surveillance and monitoring large crowds, areas, or events, helping to prevent and respond to crimes.They can also track suspects, monitor traffic, and survey crime scenes while drones with facial recognition technology can help identify known troublemakers or wanted individuals in crowds.In search and rescue operations, drones equipped with thermal sensors and high-zoom cameras can quickly locate missing persons or suspects in vast areas while in crime scene Investigation they can help investigators analyse evidence and piece together what happened.In border control, Zimbabwe has already started using drones to patrol its borders, helping to curb cross-border crimes like smuggling and human trafficking.Also, these special tools, equipped with specialised sensors, can detect explosives or hazardous materials from a safe distance, protecting police officers and the public.\n\nThis follows the graduation with drone pilot certificates of a cohort of 27 police

While the government has collected more revenue than in the same period last year, analysts say containing the deficit may prove difficult without new fiscal measures.\n\nThe local currency, the ZiG, launched in April 2024 to replace the Zimbabwe dollar, has largely remained stable against the U.S. dollar but is still overshadowed by widespread use of the dollar in everyday transactions.\n\nNcube reiterated the governments commitment to the gold-backed unit and said the currency had benefited from tight monetary and fiscal policies.\n\n",
