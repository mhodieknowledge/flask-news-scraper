            "content": "Nottinghamshire Live\n\nANottinghamshirenurse has been struck off after raping a junior colleague and getting a co-worker to give him a false alibi.Edmore Manjengwais currently serving a16-year prison sentencefor raping and sexually assaulting the woman at her home in September 2020.\n\nThe 51-year-old was also convicted of raping another woman at her home two months prior. Manjengwa, who was employed as a nurse by Nottinghamshire Healthcare Foundation Trust (NHFT), was banned from the profession following a Nursing and Midwifery Council (NMC) hearing on Tuesday, January 27.\n\nNottinghamshire Police first investigated Manjengwa in December 2020 over an allegation of rape and sexual assault but decided to take no further action on that occasion. A second allegation of rape, this time in relation to a junior colleague, was made in September 2021 and Manjengwa wascharged with the offence the following March.\n\nAs a result the first allegation was reinvestigated and he was convicted of two counts of rape and sexual assault, as well as trying to pervert the course of justice, at Nottingham Crown Court on September 14, 2023.\n\nThe following month he was sentenced to 16 years in prison and placed on the sex offenders register for life. The NMC hearing was told Manjengwa raped a woman at her home in July 2020, before raping and sexually assaulting a colleague at her home less than two months later. He then got a colleague to provide him a false alibi.\n\nNHFT said he was suspended immediately after the first allegations were made, and was dismissed four months after being charged. Presenting the case, Grace Khaile saidManjengwa had shown a lack of remorse for his actions. You were someone who they trusted as an NHS professional, she said.\n\nYour lack of insight and remorse, and the profound unacceptability of your behaviour, are indicative of deep-seated attitudinal problems.The hearing was told Manjengwa, who is being held at HMP Whatton, disagreed with the conviction and was in the process of trying to lodge an appeal.\n\nFinding in favour of a striking off order, the hearing panel said: Your behaviour has breached fundamental tenets of the nursing profession and therefore brought its reputation into disrepute.\n\n[We] considered that this order was necessary to mark the importance of maintaining public confidence in the profession, and to send to the public and the profession a clear message about the standard of behaviour required of a registered nurse.\n\nDiane Hull, executive director of nursing at NHFT, said: We take any allegations against staff very seriously. As soon as we were made aware of the allegations against this individual, we immediately suspended them pending investigation, informed the police and referred them to the NMC.\n\nWhen we were made aware of a further allegation, we again notified the NMC. I can confirm that we dismissed this person from employment in July 2022.\n\n",

I do not know the reason with that driver and he brought in a certain youngster to be his driver.\n\nWe were pushed to second him to the Mayors office when the incumbent was still in office. Interestingly the one who came in did not even have the competence to drive a manual vehicle. He was competent in automatic vehicles, said Marara.\n\nRELATED:\n\nMafume is accused of improperly suspending a council official, Samson Madzokere, who despite being absent from the City Council continues to receive a salary.\n\nNo one at the council knows the preference of the Mayor with regards to the ERP that he wants he has called us to many meetings forcing us to take that particular company to do ERP and there are minutes and that is why Samson Madzokere is at home because of ERP not because he answered to a newspaper article, he said.\n\nLast year, Mafume suspended Town Clerk Hosiah Chisango with the lattergetting wind of this through social media and even rocked up at Town House reporting for duty.\n\nMarara said there is bad blood between Chisango and Mafume which has led to numerous problems at the HCC.\n\nThere is a direct interface between the Town Clerk and the Mayor. I talked to both of them, Chisango and the Mayor. I said they needed to sit down because of the disharmony that is between them because there was friction and the disharmony was affecting the Council as a whole.\n\nThe problem is unlike the other Mayors like Mayor Masunda who could come to work once a week, the current one 0800 hours is in office and at the leaves end of the day but he is getting an allowance from government of US$95 as a Mayor. It tells you a big story, said Marara.\n\nWhen he recently made his first appearance before the Commission, Mafume denied interfering in the work of the executive at the Town House.\n\nI meet a lot of people. I meet individual Councillors and committees. Even in the Act, if a Committee is in session and I the Mayor feel that I need to come into that Committee, I am allowed to go into that Committee, said Mafume.\n\n",

A corporate rescue shields the company from liquidation and safeguards stakeholders interests.\n\nIn 2022, Fossil Mine acquired a 76,45% stake in the then Lafarge Cement Zimbabwe Limited from Associated International Cement Limited, a member of the Holcim Group before rebranding the Lafarge Cement Zimbabwe Limited to Khayah.\n\nRELATED:Legal Discussions with Vengai Madzima: Corporate Rescue in Zimbabwe\n\nThe United States Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) swiftly moved in and designated Fossil Agro, Fossil Contracting and Obey Chimuka and crippled the new shareholders plans, forcing Khaya to re-strategise.\n\nThis week, the corporate rescue practitioner, Bulisa Mbano of Grant Thornton, said during the corporate rescue proceedings no legal proceeding, including enforcement action, against the Company, or in relation to any property belonging to the Company, or lawfully in its possession, may commence or proceeded in any form without the authority of the Corporate Rescue Practitioner.\n\nHe invited all creditors to attend a meeting scheduled to take place later next month and participate in mapping the way forward.\n\nFollowing the Master of High Courts approval to extend the notice period for notifying affected persons to 31stof January 2025, the first meeting of creditors and members of the company will now be held on the 19th of February 2025 at 0900hrs at Chapman Golf Club, 6 Smit Cresent, Harare, Zimbabwe.\n\nThis meeting is for proof of claims, an overview of corporate rescue proceedings, a statement by the Master of the High Court about reasonable prospects of rescuing the company, and appointment of a committee of creditors, he said.\n\nThose owed money by the company were required to complete an affidavit for Proof of Claim Form and complete these forms in duplicate, attach all supporting documents, and lodge them with the Master of the High Court, at the Masters office.\n\n",

            "content": "By Nqoba M Sibenke\n\nResearch has shown that physical clutter harms our mental wellbeing. A disorganized environment, and chaotic affects cognition, and decision-making and even impact our mood1. Clutter has also been associated with mental health issues such as depression, anxiety and stress. As such, decluttering has been proven to have a positive influence on our mental health, reducing stress and negative emotions, boosting self-confidence and esteem, and enhancing heightened motivation and productivity2.\n\nAnd so the decluttering process can start in our physical spaces. We have lots of stuff that we are keeping that we need to get rid of  in our wardrobes piles of clothes that we are no longer in need of yet we could give away to those in need. Ive come across old pots in my mothers cupboards and I am sure many are still holding on to pots and plates that are no longer in use. Maybe if we clear up our cupboards and create more space it will also help us to clear up our minds. Theres a lot that we are holding onto; old carpets, and old furniture that is breaking down, our spaces are so congested and so is our mind space.\n\nIn the physical space, clutter takes up more space and leaves no space for new furniture or property. Similarly, mental clutter congests the mind and prevents us from new experiences. For some of us, trauma is the clutter that we are still holding onto. It might be childhood trauma or recent trauma. Trauma brings with it anxiety, fear, anger, mood swings and all other mental baggage. Imagine moving around with such a load of negativity.\n\nTrauma repels positive relationships and experiences, it deprives us of enjoying life as we should. And this is why we should offload trauma before the year ends. One of the best ways of offloading trauma is therapy. Therapy will help us to develop coping mechanisms to deal with the triggers. Therapy also helps us to manage our emotions and be able to manage our situations.\n\nAs part of decluttering, we need to deal with toxic relationships and partnerships. Toxic relationships are not just limited to romantic relationships but also extend to friendships. By definition a toxic relationship is a relationship characterized by harmful, damaging, and destructive patterns of behaviour. It can be romantic, familial, friendship, or professional. Such relationships exhibit abusive and manipulative characteristics, lack of respect and overstepping boundaries, emotional abuse, manipulation, emotional unavailability, and a train of unpleasant experiences. Toxic relationships leave us feeling wretched and useless. They reduce our self-image and self-esteem and lead to conditions like depression, anxiety, trust issues and lack of confidence. We need to surround ourselves with positive relationships and support systems, people who appreciate us and value us, and people who bring out the best in us. Moving away is a choice that we can make. Its time to get up, dust ourselves and start a fresh new journey.\n\nWe have feelings that we have bottled up for so long, feelings that make us angry, bitter and irritable. We also ruminate, yes I said ruminate. Rumination is the process of re-chewing food, in mental health spaces it refers to repetitive negative thinking patterns where we fish out past regrets, disappointments, thoughts, and experiences and we re-live them. This compromises not only our mental but also our physical well-being. It also affects our relationships with the people around us as well as intimate relationships. People who ruminate often suffer from anxiety and stress. It is time to let go. Journaling is an excellent way of expressing our feelings. Write about it. If there is a way of saying it out, this is the chance. Find someone to talk to and share your frustrations and negative experiences. This will help you to release the pressure.\n\nIt has always been said that we are our own enemies. Negative self-talk is one way that we sabotage ourselves. We focus on our weaknesses and we tell ourselves that we are not good enough. Sometimes we compare ourselves with the next person and fail to see our real value. This creates clutter in our minds and we need to remove it. We have to affirm ourselves and practice self-compassion. This will go a long way in promoting our mental health.\n\nThere are habits that we have developed which are unhealthy, unproductive and destructive. It is time for us to deal with these habits. Procrastination, lack of punctuality, laziness, self-sabotaging, and indecision, are all things that we have to offload if we desire a happy new year.\n\nHere are steps that can help us in the process of decluttering;\n\nIt is not too late to make important changes in our lives. Prioritising our mental health will go a long way in 2025.\n\nNqoba Sibenke is registered with AHPCZ as an intern Counselling Psychologist and can be reached atnqoba.sibenke@icloud.com\n\n",

            "content": "The Mail and Guardian\n\nRwanda President Paul Kagame issued a stark warning to South Africa late on Wednesday night, accusing President Cyril Ramaphosa and his government of distorting facts about the ongoing conflict in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and suggesting that Rwanda is prepared for confrontation if necessary.\n\nWhat has been said about [the conversations I had with Ramaphosa this week] in the media by South African officials and President Ramaphosa himself contains a lot of distortion, deliberate attacks, and even lies.\n\nIf words can change so much from a conversation to a public statement, it says a lot about how these very important issues are being managed, Kagame said in a post on his X account, in reply to Ramaphosas posted statement.\n\nRamaphosas statement followed the death of 13 South African soldiers deployed as part of the Southern African Development Community Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (SAMIDRC).\n\nThe death of the South African soldiers has intensified political and military scrutiny in Pretoria, forcing the government to justify its intervention in the decades-long conflict while navigating increasingly strained ties with Rwanda.\n\nSouth African officials have blamed the escalating violence on the M23 rebel group and the Rwandan Defence Force.\n\nInternational relations minister Ronald Lamola has said that South Africa is engaging with the African Union Peace and Security Council and the United Nations Security Council to push for an immediate ceasefire.\n\nIn his post, Kagame dismissed South Africas involvement in the peacekeeping, saying that SAMIDRC was not a peacekeeping mission but a belligerent force supporting the Congolese government.\n\nHe accused SAMIDRC of working alongside the Forces Dmocratiques de Libration du Rwanda (FDLR), a militia with historical ties to perpetrators of the 1994 Rwandan genocide.\n\nFDLR targeted Rwanda, Kagame said, while also threatening to take the war to Rwanda itself.\n\nHe accused SAMIDRC of replacing the East African Community Regional Force, which he characterised as the only legitimate peacekeeping operation in the region.\n\nPresident Ramaphosa has never given a warning of any kind, unless it was delivered in his local language which I do not understand, Kagame said in his statement, addressing the notion that he had been cautioned by his South African counterpart.\n\nHe claimed instead that Ramaphosa had requested logistical assistance to ensure that South African troops had electricity, food, and water, which Rwanda would help facilitate.\n\nKagame said Ramaphosa had personally acknowledged that M23 was not responsible for the deaths of South African soldiers, but rather the Armed Forces of the DRC (FARDC).\n\nIf South Africa wants to contribute to peaceful solutions, that is well and good, but South Africa is in no position to take on the role of a peacemaker or mediator. And if South Africa prefers confrontation, Rwanda will deal with the matter in that context any day.\n\nEarlier, Ramaphosa had said that the fighting was the result of an escalation by the rebel group M23 and Rwanda Defence Force militia engaging the Armed Forces of the DRC and attacking peacekeepers from the SADC Mission.\n\nHe described the security situation as tense, volatile, and unpredictable.\n\nHe said that full support was being provided to those injured in the fighting, as well as to the families of the slain South African soldiers.\n\nRamaphosa said that South Africas military presence in the DRC was part of a regional and international peacekeeping effort.\n\nSouth Africas military presence in the eastern DRC is not a declaration of war against any country or state, he said. The SAMIDRC was there to protect civilians and uphold stability in the war-torn region.\n\nHe called on all parties to honour peace agreements, including the Luanda Process, and to respect the DRCs territorial integrity. He also welcomed the recent United Nations Security Council resolution urging an end to hostilities and the withdrawal of foreign forces from Congolese territory.\n\n",

            "content": "Onmanorama\n\nIndia  Kochi: Sharon Chigwaza (33), a Zimbabwean beautician caught with 2,910 gm of heroin at Kochi airport, was sentenced to 22 years of rigorous imprisonment under two sections of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act on Wednesday.\n\nErnakulam Additional Sessions VII judge VPM Sureshbabu also slapped a fine of Rs 1.5 lakh each under section 21 (c) and section 23 (c) of the NDPS Act for carrying and smuggling in the narcotic drug to India. If the fine is not paid, she must serve another six months each for the two charges.\n\nD Pramila, the Intelligence Officer of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) in Kochi, investigated the case.\n\nChigwaza said she was just a carrier who agreed to bring in the drugs to raise money for her treatment in Delhi.\n\nThe court, however, did not go into the reasons for the crime, said Special Public Prosecutor for the NCB Adv Sunil J. Five grams of heroin is a small quantity, and 250 gm is a commercial quantity. Chigwaza was caught with nearly 12 times the commercial quantity, said Adv Sunil.\n\nThe minimum punishment for carrying and smuggling commercial quantities of heroin is 10 years each, and the maximum punishment is 20 years each. The court factored in her poor background and the fact that she was a woman and sentenced her to 11 years for each offence, he said. The sentences will run concurrently, so she will serve only 11 years in prison, he said.\n\nAccording to her statement to investigators, Chigwaza had been living as a refugee in South Africa with her parents and two sisters. However, NCB officials said her refugee certificate was fake.\n\nOn June 19, 2021, she landed at Kochi airport from Johannesburg via Doha on a Qatar Airways flight. As she prepared to board an onward IndiGo flight to Delhi, airport security grew suspicious and detained her. They found 2,910 gm of heroin in a secret pocket in her trolley bag. She was arrested, and the case was handed over to NCB.\n\nChigwaza told the officials that she had suffered multiple miscarriages and wanted money for treatment in Delhi. She said her Nigerian friend Ifeanyi offered her $2,000 (around Rs 1.47 lakh in June 2021) if she delivered the contraband at a Delhi lodge.\n\nHe reportedly told her that his brother would pick up the package and give her the money.\n\nShe took up the offer. It was her first trip to India. Special Public Prosecutor Adv Sunil said the courts sentencing clearly communicated that irrespective of nationality or circumstances, peddling drugs is a crime against the nation and will be punished. The court also said that the three years and seven months she spent in prison before her conviction would be deducted from her sentence.\n\n",
