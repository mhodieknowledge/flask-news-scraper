Failure to pay monthly rentals is a serious breach of the agreement of lease which mandates City of Harare to evoke the conditions of lease and recover holding costs from the same.\n\nNotwithstanding the availability or none of the lease agreement, council shall not be prejudiced in its rights to recover holding costs from the lessee for breach of mutual understanding, read the notice.\n\nThe notice comes on the back of Harare City, on the drive to recover money it is being owed by tenants leasing their properties.\n\nHowever, in Mbare, Harare City is under pressure to renovate the flats which are becoming uninhabitable.\n\nLast year, the High Court ordered Harare City Council to renovate the flats to match decent living standards. The City fathers have appealed the judgement.\n\nIn an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) director, Ruben Akili, said the deplorable living conditions have dissuaded tenants from paying their rentals.\n\nThese are the same flats which we had a court order for renovations. As you are aware all the flats in Mbare were supposed to be renovated. The situation in Mbare is unacceptable sewer is gushing all over and many things are just happening and many things are happening.\n\nFrom CHRAs perspective is that some residents are paying and some are not paying. Local Authority should address the fundamental problems that speaks to the reasons why residents are not paying, said Akili.\n\n",

            "content": "The Star\n\nGolden Moyo* is a lay preacher in rural Zimbabwe. In 2018, after decades of hiding his sexual orientation, Moyo came out to his family and friends and his parish as gay.\n\nAttitudes to sexual and gender minorities in Zimbabwe are highly conservative. Those found guilty of consensual same-sex sexual activity could face up to one years imprisonment and a fine. The southern African countrys anti-homosexuality law was first introduced by the British during its colonisation of Zimbabwe.\n\nAccording toHuman Dignity Trust, the country has noted consistent reports of discrimination and violence being committed against LGBTQIA+ people in recent years, including assault, sexual violence, harassment, blackmail, and the denial of basic rights and services.\n\nMoyos decision has not been without consequence. News of his sexuality soon went viral (with)people deliberating upon it, he says. There was alsoaprotest at the churchs headquarters.\n\nSays Moyo: They were saying things like this is against our culture. This is against our religion. This is against our lawsThey say it is strange. It is not part of us and did not originate from our own people. (That) its a Western thing. When the noise started, (with) people protesting, you really need people who stand up to say, No, this thing isnotWestern. Its our own thing. It hasalwaysbeen in our midst.\n\nFor Moyo, as with an increasing number of LGBTQIA+ persons across the country, social media is an essential tool in a continued push for a break from the narrative that homosexuality  and queerness, more broadly  is a Western import.\n\nMoyos social media accounts on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X (formerly, Twitter) has a combined following of just under 10 000 people. He also uses Clubhouse for the (weekly) LGBTQIA+ fellowship.\n\nMoyo says he first realised the power of social media during the Covid-19 pandemic. We could not gather as Christians, so we used to worship via social media. I realised that this is a thing that can quickly spread the message to othersI thought of it as a way that my voice can also be heard.\n\nTanatswa Gumbo, communications officer for the countrys largest queer rights organisation, Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe, says LGBTQIA+ people definitely have become more visible on social media. Image: Supplied\n\nTanatswa Gumbo, communications officer for the countrys largest queer rights organisation,Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe (GALZ), says LGBTQIA+ people definitely have become more visible on social media.\n\nLGBTQIA+ persons, particularly activists, have really been visible and have really become more outspoken in terms of challenging conservative attitudes towards LGBTQIA+ people. Especially the claims of homosexuality being un-African; not being Christian, says Gumbo.\n\nResearch conducted by Princess Sibanda and Gibson Ncubefoundthat, for queer Zimbabweans, online spaces represent a powerful act of resistance, a way for queer Zimbabweans to claim their right to exist and express themselves.Its like theyre sending love letters to the world, saying that queer love is just as important and beautiful as any other kind of love.\n\nZimbabwe is, of course, only one of numerous African states to have inherited homophobic laws and attitudes as a result of colonisation. The end of colonial rule has, however, seen some countries (such as Uganda, Nigeria, Kenya and Namibia) place added restrictions on the rights of LGBTQIA+ persons.\n\nGhana is one such country. The West African state inherited its first anti-homosexuality law during British rule.Section 104 of the countrys Criminal Code of 1960  seen largely as an after-effect of the colonial era  carries with it a sentence of up to three years imprisonment for men found guilty of consensual same-sex relations.\n\nGhanas latest anti-LGBT law, thePromotion of Proper Human Sexual Rights and Ghanaian Family Values Bill (commonly known as the Anti-LGBT Bill), is particularly draconian and has been described asbrutal, harsh, and unjust.\n\nIn 2021,Angel Maxine, Ghanas only openly transgender musician and queer rights activist, penned a song, titledKill the Bill, in protest against the Anti-LGBT Bill. In addition to using her music as a tool for awareness-raising, Maxine also relies heavily on social media to try and effect change.\n\nIf social media was availableduring the colonial days, Im sure a lot of people would have been educated by now, and we would (not be in) this era that we are in, Maxine says, in reference to the increasing queerphobic rhetoric sweeping across the continent. Because even though some of us are on social media, we are still living in our colonial days; still carrying the colonial thinking. But there are also people who are using social media who have broken free from this colonialism. In Africa, we have made use of social media positively to educate people.\n\nMaxine is nowliving in Berlin, having fled Ghana as a result of persecution based on her gender identity and her queer rights activism. The distance from her home country makes her rely on social media even more.\n\nSometimes when the grounds become very hard and difficult for us to meet in person, social media is where we can meet. I am currently in Germany, but Im communicating with people in Ghana through social media.\n\nAlex Kofi Donkor, the executive director of LGBT Rights Ghana, says LGBTQIA+ Ghanaians are creating social media content that challenges the narrative that queerness is a Western import. Image:Supplied\n\nAlexKofi Donkoris the founder and executive director of LGBT Rights Ghana. I would say most of the mobilisation and most of the engagement at the initial stages (of establishing LGBT Rights Ghana)] was through social media. Even as of now, most of the mobilisation is done via various social media platforms, says Donkor.\n\nAside from activists utilising social media for policy and attitude reforms, there are also individual members of Ghanas LGBTQIA+ communities who, Donkor says, are putting content out there that challenges the status quo and challenges so many thoughts that Ghanaians have around LGBTQIA+ issuesthat its a Western import.\n\nAs could be expected, given the repressive contexts in which this content is created, there are downsides to proudly sharing pro-LGBTQIA+ content.\n\nA recent example of this was when a queer South African undertook the social media campaign, #ShowGhanaLove. Ostensibly meant as a show of solidarity with queer Ghanaians, the campaign had the opposite effect, as anti-queer politicians used the resultant public outrage to add pressure on the Ghanaian government to expedite the passing of theAnti-LGBT Bill.\n\nSays Donkor: People tend to react quickly when (LGBTQIA+ content) is openly or obviously put out there. People tend to react in a very negative way.\n\nGhanaian human rights activist, Angel Maxine, sees social media as an integral tool in raising awareness. Image: Eemmax Experience\n\nAngel Maxine is nonplussed by negative comments. Social media is a safe space for me, even though the comments and all those things arent 100% safe, it is a safe space for me, she says.\n\nSocial media, she adds, resulted in what she sees as her biggest success as an activist: the collaboration with fellow musicians,Wanlov the Kubolor and Sister Deborah, which led to her song,Wo Fie.\n\nWo Fiemeans your home, Maxine explains. We all come from homes, whether (we are) LGBTQIA or not. A queer person could be your brother, could be your sister. So we just have to love, respect and accept queer people for who they are. Religion is not our culture. The Bible is not our culture. The only culture that has been imported to Africa is hate.\n\nAs to whether she says a point at which she might rely less on social media as a tool for her activism, Maxine says firmly: No, no. I dont think I see that happening.\n\nBack in his home in rural Zimbabwe, Moyo echoes the same sentiment.\n\nYou know, he sighs, to get the church to accept us, we have attended the meetings, the synods, the meetings in the archdiocese, the councils, but it was of no useSo, theres no other way, since we have been blocked on top. So, we are saying this is the time to make our voices heardMaybe changes may comeOur people still believe its a Western influence. A taboo in our culture. Yet, we are saying its our own thing. So, we will keep on fighting, no matter how hard it gets.\n\n* Not his real name\n\n* Carl Collison is a journalist, photographer, filmmaker, and researcher.

            "content": "By Dr Richard Dune\n\nResuscitation mistakes are not just clinical errors  they are leadership failures that demand urgent action\n\nAction should be taken.  Coroner Darren Stewart OBE\n\nThe tragic death of 74-year-old Kathleen Gregory at Beccles Care Home should haunt every health and social care leader in the UK. She choked on her lunch and was not resuscitated  the attending paramedic wrongly assumed she was not for resuscitation after misreading her ReSPECT form.\n\nThe coroners Prevention of Future Deaths Report makes it plain: unless leaders fix the governance failures that led to this, more people will die unnecessarily.\n\nWeve been here before. During COVID-19, some providers issued blanket Do Not Attempt Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation (DNACPR) notices without consulting patients or families. Investigations revealed:\n\nDecisions made withoutMental Capacity Actcompliance\n\nStaff assuming all care home residents were DNACPR\n\nPoor understanding of DNACPR and ReSPECT in real emergencies.\n\nThese are not isolated oversights  they are systemic governance failures.\n\nIt is fashionable for executives and boards to talk about lessons learned after tragedies. But heres the truth: if your governance system fails, its not just the frontline staff at fault  its you.\n\nLeaders control:\n\nWhether policies and procedures are current and accessible\n\nWhether statutory and mandatory training is scenario-based and relevant\n\nWhether staff have real-time access to secure document repositories for emergency care plans\n\nWhether digital compliance systems and Learning Management Systems (LMS) track workforce competence.\n\nIf these are missing, its a leadership choice, not an accident.\n\nTheMental Capacity Act 2005,Human Rights Act 1998,Equality Act 2010, and CQC Regulations are not guidelines  they are legal obligations. Failure to meet them risks breaching human rights as well as professional and organisational reputations.\n\nIf someone in your care dies tomorrow due to a DNACPR or resuscitation error:\n\nCan you prove your governance framework was watertight?\n\nCan you show your policies were up to date, accessible, and audited?\n\nCan you evidence that your staff were trained, competent, and supported?\n\nIf the answer is no, then the gap is not just operational  its moral.\n\nModern regulatory compliance software can integrate:\n\nSecure policy storage with version control\n\nLMSand Training Management System (TMS) functions to ensurestatutory and mandatory trainingis completed and tracked\n\nAudit dashboards to identify risks before they become tragedies.\n\nIf leaders still rely on paper and memory systems in 2025, they are gambling with lives.\n\nWe can no longer pretend that fatal mistakes like those in the Beccles case are just human error. They are the predictable result of leadership and governance gaps.\n\nIn health and social care, accountability starts at the top.\n\nIf leaders dont enforce compliance, invest in training, and deploy the right systems, they are complicit in the failures that follow.\n\nThe sector doesnt need more apologies  it needs boardrooms that act before the coroner does.\n\nAs Founder & CEO of The Mandatory Training Group, I led the development of ComplyPlus, our regulatory compliance management software designed to stop governance failures before they happen.\n\nLearn howComplyPluscan help your organisation centralise policies, track training, and make the right decisions under pressure.\n\nOriginally published onThe Mandatory Training Groupwebsite.\n\n",

The company anticipates the plant to reach a sustained steady-state of operation, enabling Zulu to target overall plant availability of 22 days per month, as was originally projected as the required availability to meet target production levels.\n\nDuring the next seven days, we expect to be able to take a final decision on how soon, if at all, the purchase of the secondary spodumene float section should proceed, said Premier.\n\nAt the same time, plans are progressing with the two remaining plant issues requiring longer-term solutions, the replacement of the original OEM-supplied sorters that are not fit for purpose and completion of the tantalum recovery circuit. In regard to the tantalum circuit, we have had interest from several parties seeking to purchase tantalum and potentially assisting with the cost of the circuit.\n\nPremier has struggled to keep its spodumene production plant operating optimally since it set it up some two years ago.\n\nAs a result, it missed the target to make the first spodumene shipment to Chinese offtaker, Canmax Technologies (Canmax), by March 2023.\n\nThree months later, it declared force majeure, but Canmax contested the declaration and demanded repayment of the $35mn it provided to Premier to build the processing plant.\n\n",
