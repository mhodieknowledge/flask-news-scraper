            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nA BID by the former Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor, Gideon Gono to avoid trial in a US$3 million debt case has hit a snag after the High Court overturned the latest application for absolution.Gono, in his personal capacity and as director of his associate companies amongst them Lunar Chickens, was dragged to the court for failing to settle a US$3 million loan owed to a South Africa based firm, ASP Marketing CC.The South African firm, through its lawyers, Chambati, Mataka & Makonese Attorneys said sometime in 2009, Lunar Chickens entered into agreement with the company for the sale of 2, 209, 72 metric tonnes of maize at US$395 per metric tonne.The material terms of the verbal agreement were that the South African based firm would deliver the maize at Gonos New Donnington Farm, which was duly done in December 2009 and May 2010 before he made the payment.However, Gonos Lunar Chickens failed to pay for the maize delivered as per verbal agreement despite demand, instead opting to pay just US$140, 000 in 2011 and 2012 despite the outstanding amount claimed for delivery of both maize and soya beans is US$2, 2 million.In 2023, the High Court dismissed the former exchequers court application for dismissal of the claim on technical grounds, after he sought to block a full trial on the matter citing a number of irregularities in the ASP Marketing CC application. He submitted that ASP Marketing was only due to receive shares in Lunar Chickens for the equivalent amount of the delivered maize and soya beans.The ex-central bank boss said he would not at any material time enter into such an agreement as he argued that the agreement between him and the South African firm was illegal as payment of such a hefty amount in foreign currency outside the country required approval of the RBZ in line with Exchange Control Regulations of which he was the RBZ governor at the time. The exchange control approval, he alleged, was never obtained first from the RBZ, which he was in charge of at the material time.Gono and his associate companies appealed against the High Court judgment at the Supreme Court. The appeal was dismissed with costs, insisting that the matter presented by ASP Marketing CC must be heard on the merits as the preliminary points by Gono and his associate companies had no merit.When the trial commenced again in July 2025 at the High Court before Justice Mafusire, ASP Marketing CC represented by Advocate Fadzai Mahere instructed by Chambati, Mataka and Makonese Attorneys At Law, testified and led evidence but Gono through his lawyers Advocate Sylvester Hashiti, instructed by Tendai Biti Law, to avoid the trial continuing, filed an application for absolution for the instance at the end of the plaintiffs case. They argued that the plaintiff had not led any evidence on any aspect of the plaintiffs claim and that they had not produced any document to prove liability or quantum.However, Gonos application of absolution from instance was dismissed with costs by Justice Mafusire stating in his judgment that, It is perhaps because the application for absolution from the instance was incredibly ridiculous that counsel for the plaintiff objected to its being made in the first place.The judge added, There is no question that the application for absolution from the instance has no merit. It must be a stratagem by the defendants to stall progress of the trial. If true, that is an abuse of the court process.The ruling has literally left the former RBZ top official in the open, with a full trial set to play out in court.\n\nA BID by the former Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor, Gideon Gono to avoid trial in a US$3 million debt case has hit a snag after the High Court overturned the latest application for absolution.\n\nGono, in his personal capacity and as director of his associate companies amongst them Lunar Chickens, was dragged to the court for failing to settle a US$3 million loan owed to a South Africa based firm, ASP Marketing CC.The South African firm, through its lawyers, Chambati, Mataka & Makonese Attorneys said sometime in 2009, Lunar Chickens entered into agreement with the company for the sale of 2, 209, 72 metric tonnes of maize at US$395 per metric tonne.The material terms of the verbal agreement were that the South African based firm would deliver the maize at Gonos New Donnington Farm, which was duly done in December 2009 and May 2010 before he made the payment.However, Gonos Lunar Chickens failed to pay for the maize delivered as per verbal agreement despite demand, instead opting to pay just US$140, 000 in 2011 and 2012 despite the outstanding amount claimed for delivery of both maize and soya beans is US$2, 2 million.In 2023, the High Court dismissed the former exchequers court application for dismissal of the claim on technical grounds, after he sought to block a full trial on the matter citing a number of irregularities in the ASP Marketing CC application.

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nDESPITE efforts being made by the Zimbabwean authorities to revamp the countrys health situation, an opposition member of the National Assembly Ransome Makamure has urged the government to declare the public health a state of emergency.Moving a motion in Parliament this Thursday, Makamure told the acting Speaker that despite the Constitution of Zimbabwes provision of right to health care for all citizens, the majority were finding it difficult to access basic health care services.Makamure stated that section 76(4) of Zimbabwes Constitution obliges the State to take reasonable measures, within the limits of available resources to achieve the progressive realisation of the right to health care, but this was not the case on the ground.I urge the government to declare public health a state of emergency with a focus on maternal care and chronic diseases and to mobilise both domestic and international support as a matter of urgency.This House beseeches the government to declare the current public health situation a state of emergency so that the requisite resources can be mobilised to mitigate the challenges faced whilst the government ensures that the Finance ministry disburses all outstanding budgetary allocations due to the Health and Child Care ministry, Makamure said.The MP highlighted that the countrys health system had collapsed whilst the constitutional right to health care was now a privilege, only being accessed by a few.The health crisis, according to Makamure, reflected structural under-funding where Zimbabwe currently spends less than 40 dollars per patient annually, far below the Abuja Declaration target of 86 dollars per patient.The public healthcare system is in critical decline with over 250 preventable deaths recorded at major referral hospitals in 2024 alone, largely due to persistent shortage of essential medicines and basic equipment including oxygen, painkillers, antibiotics, gloves, surgical supplies and even clean water, said Makamure.The acting Speaker cautioned the MP saying, as much as we want to do our debates in a free and open space, it is important to do that with some level of decorum that will not necessarily tarnish this House or cast aspersions that are unnecessary for our country.I am not talking about things that I read, I am talking about things that our people are experiencing out there, Makamure responded.The acting Speaker did not agree, saying Our hospitals have not collapsed, people are still being cured. Yes, we might have problems, but let us put it in that perspective.The MP further alleged that at most public referral centres, patients were routinely asked to bring their own painkillers, cotton wool and surgical gloves, highlighting the depth of under-funding and resource scarcity.At Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo, repeated breakdowns of major equipment have left patients, particularly cancer patients, without treatment for extended periods, effectively turning a diagnosis into a death sentence for many.Across central, provincial and district hospitals, patients often sleep on the floor due to a lack of beds and hospital kitchens frequently run out of food, forcing some patients to go hungry while recovering from illness or surgery.Many hospital buildings and infrastructure have deteriorated significantly. Peeling paint, leaking roofs, broken windows, blocked plumbing and outdated equipment dominate once functional health institutions Makamure added.The legislator told the acting speaker that the current physical decay did not inspire hope in patients, but deepened despair, reinforcing the perception that the lives do not matter to those in power and Parliament included.This dire situation reflects systematic or systemic neglect where under-investment, poor planning and misplaced priorities have reduced public health facilities to places of suffering.The MP stated that the erosion of basic standards in patient care was not only a humanitarian crisis but a direct violation of Zimbabwes right to health and dignity.The late Alex Magaisa (may his soul rest in peace) said: a State that cannot provide basic healthcare to its people cannot call itself sovereign, the MP told the house.He said the government was failing to guarantee the most basic condition of life, which is health.Figures speak for themselves, said Makamure before Zanu PF Chief Whip Pupurai Togarepi chipped in; We cannot allow the gentleman, whoever he is, to continue lying. Here at this Parliament, if he wants to go to the clinic here, he is going to be treated.So, for him now to start attacking the State to the point of saying we cannot call ourselves sovereign, is he supposed to be a Zimbabwean or we are dealing with some foreigner? Togarepi fumed.We are not taking what he is saying lightly. We do not want you to come here and parade your hatred of our institutions.We need people who are honest when they debate. We have challenges, nobody can run away from that. We are a developing country after all. We do not want somebody to come here and dramatise things that are not there.Opposition MP Shakespear Hamauswa intervened on a point of order.We saw on social media a publication by Hon. Minister Machakaire, when he visited Parirenyatwa Hospital lamenting the situation at our hospitals, that was then followed by the visit of His Excellency, President E. D. Mnangagwa.If you have a situation in a country which requires the visitation of number one of that country, then it means that situation is in a state of emergency, MP Hamauswa told the acting speaker.The acting speaker however, reminded Hamauswa that Zimbabwes public health situation was functional with efforts being done to correct the healthcare system.Makamure went further giving examples of institutions experiencing challenges.As of March 2025, Zimbabwes rural health system remains in a dire state, exposing deep structural and policy failures. According to the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights (ZADHR), over 75% of rural clinics lack electricity.The doctor-to-patient ratio stands approximately at one doctor saving 4,300 people nationally.The government has failed to implement meaningful reforms, perpetuating inequality and avoidable loss of life in under-served regions, he said.He even went further to expose the poor remuneration of health workers.Salaries for public health workers remain dismally low, ranging between USD250 and USD284 a month, barely enough to survive, comparing that to USD540 which was being earned during the Inclusive Government.He said the poor remuneration and lack of career growth, training or incentives for healthcare workers had driven more than 4,000 health professionals, including 2, 600 nurses, to leave the country in search of greener pastures.If you look at non-communicable diseases, public hospitals lack diagnostic equipment, cancer screening services and those who are diagnosed with the disease spend years on the waiting list.Makamure alleged there was no clear public record of how much was spent on procuring cancer machines or whether those machines are fully functional.\n\nDESPITE efforts being made by the Zimbabwean authorities to revamp the countrys health situation, an opposition member of the National Assembly Ransome Makamure has urged the government to declare the public health a state of emergency.\n\nMoving a motion in Parliament this Thursday, Makamure told the acting Speaker that despite the Constitution of Zimbabwes provision of right to health care for all citizens, the majority were finding it difficult to access basic health care services.Makamure stated that section 76(4) of Zimbabwes Constitution obliges the State to take reasonable measures, within the limits of available resources to achieve the progressive realisation of the right to health care, but this was not the case on the ground.I urge the government to declare public health a state of emergency with a focus on maternal care and chronic diseases and to mobilise both domestic and international support as a matter of urgency.This House beseeches the government to declare the current public health situation a state of emergency so that the requisite resources can be mobilised to mitigate the challenges faced whilst the government ensures that the Finance ministry disburses all outstanding budgetary allocations due to the Health and Child Care ministry, Makamure said.The MP highlighted that the countrys health system had collapsed whilst the constitutional right to health care was now a privilege, only being accessed by a few.The health crisis, according to Makamure, reflected structural under-funding where Zimbabwe currently spends less than 40 dollars per patient annually, far below the Abuja Declaration target of 86 dollars per patient.The public healthcare system is in critical decline with over 250 preventable deaths recorded at major referral hospitals in 2024 alone, largely due to persistent shortage of essential medicines and basic equipment including oxygen, painkillers, antibiotics, gloves, surgical supplies and even clean water, said Makamure.The acting Speaker cautioned the MP saying, as much as we want to do our debates in a free and open space, it is important to do that with some level of decorum that will not necessarily tarnish this House or cast aspersions that are unnecessary for our country.I am not talking about things that I read, I am talking about things that our people are experiencing out there, Makamure responded.The acting Speaker did not agree, saying Our hospitals have not collapsed, people are still being cured. Yes, we might have problems, but let us put it in that perspective.The MP further alleged that at most public referral centres, patients were routinely asked to bring their own painkillers, cotton wool and surgical gloves, highlighting the depth of under-funding and resource scarcity.At Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo, repeated breakdowns of major equipment have left patients, particularly cancer patients, without treatment for extended periods, effectively turning a diagnosis into a death sentence for many.Across central, provincial and district hospitals, patients often sleep on the floor due to a lack of beds and hospital kitchens frequently run out of food, forcing some patients to go hungry while recovering from illness or surgery.Many hospital buildings and infrastructure have deteriorated significantly. Peeling paint, leaking roofs, broken windows, blocked plumbing and outdated equipment dominate once functional health institutions Makamure added.The legislator told the acting speaker that the current physical decay did not inspire hope in patients, but deepened despair, reinforcing the perception that the lives do not matter to those in power and Parliament included.This dire situation reflects systematic or systemic neglect where under-investment, poor planning and misplaced priorities have reduced public health facilities to places of suffering.The MP stated that the erosion of basic standards in patient care was not only a humanitarian crisis but a direct violation of Zimbabwes right to health and dignity.The late Alex Magaisa (may his soul rest in peace) said: a State that cannot provide basic healthcare to its people cannot call itself sovereign, the MP told the house.He said the government was failing to guarantee the most basic condition of life, which is health.Figures speak for themselves, said Makamure before Zanu PF Chief Whip Pupurai Togarepi chipped in; We cannot allow the gentleman, whoever he is, to continue lying. Here at this Parliament, if he wants to go to the clinic here, he is going to be treated.So, for him now to start attacking the State to the point of saying we cannot call ourselves sovereign, is he supposed to be a Zimbabwean or we are dealing with some foreigner? Togarepi fumed.We are not taking what he is saying lightly. We do not want you to come here and parade your hatred of our institutions.We need people who are honest when they debate. We have challenges, nobody can run away from that. We are a developing country after all. We do not want somebody to come here and dramatise things that are not there.Opposition MP Shakespear Hamauswa intervened on a point of order.We saw on social media a publication by Hon.

According to the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights (ZADHR), over 75% of rural clinics lack electricity.The doctor-to-patient ratio stands approximately at one doctor saving 4,300 people nationally.The government has failed to implement meaningful reforms, perpetuating inequality and avoidable loss of life in under-served regions, he said.He even went further to expose the poor remuneration of health workers.Salaries for public health workers remain dismally low, ranging between USD250 and USD284 a month, barely enough to survive, comparing that to USD540 which was being earned during the Inclusive Government.He said the poor remuneration and lack of career growth, training or incentives for healthcare workers had driven more than 4,000 health professionals, including 2, 600 nurses, to leave the country in search of greener pastures.If you look at non-communicable diseases, public hospitals lack diagnostic equipment, cancer screening services and those who are diagnosed with the disease spend years on the waiting list.Makamure alleged there was no clear public record of how much was spent on procuring cancer machines or whether those machines are fully functional.\n\nThe health crisis, according to Makamure, reflected structural under-funding where Zimbabwe currently spends less than 40 dollars per patient annually, far below the Abuja Declaration target of 86 dollars per patient.\n\nThe public healthcare system is in critical decline with over 250 preventable deaths recorded at major referral hospitals in 2024 alone, largely due to persistent shortage of essential medicines and basic equipment including oxygen, painkillers, antibiotics, gloves, surgical supplies and even clean water, said Makamure.The acting Speaker cautioned the MP saying, as much as we want to do our debates in a free and open space, it is important to do that with some level of decorum that will not necessarily tarnish this House or cast aspersions that are unnecessary for our country.I am not talking about things that I read, I am talking about things that our people are experiencing out there, Makamure responded.The acting Speaker did not agree, saying Our hospitals have not collapsed, people are still being cured. Yes, we might have problems, but let us put it in that perspective.The MP further alleged that at most public referral centres, patients were routinely asked to bring their own painkillers, cotton wool and surgical gloves, highlighting the depth of under-funding and resource scarcity.At Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo, repeated breakdowns of major equipment have left patients, particularly cancer patients, without treatment for extended periods, effectively turning a diagnosis into a death sentence for many.Across central, provincial and district hospitals, patients often sleep on the floor due to a lack of beds and hospital kitchens frequently run out of food, forcing some patients to go hungry while recovering from illness or surgery.Many hospital buildings and infrastructure have deteriorated significantly. Peeling paint, leaking roofs, broken windows, blocked plumbing and outdated equipment dominate once functional health institutions Makamure added.The legislator told the acting speaker that the current physical decay did not inspire hope in patients, but deepened despair, reinforcing the perception that the lives do not matter to those in power and Parliament included.This dire situation reflects systematic or systemic neglect where under-investment, poor planning and misplaced priorities have reduced public health facilities to places of suffering.The MP stated that the erosion of basic standards in patient care was not only a humanitarian crisis but a direct violation of Zimbabwes right to health and dignity.The late Alex Magaisa (may his soul rest in peace) said: a State that cannot provide basic healthcare to its people cannot call itself sovereign, the MP told the house.He said the government was failing to guarantee the most basic condition of life, which is health.Figures speak for themselves, said Makamure before Zanu PF Chief Whip Pupurai Togarepi chipped in; We cannot allow the gentleman, whoever he is, to continue lying. Here at this Parliament, if he wants to go to the clinic here, he is going to be treated.So, for him now to start attacking the State to the point of saying we cannot call ourselves sovereign, is he supposed to be a Zimbabwean or we are dealing with some foreigner? Togarepi fumed.We are not taking what he is saying lightly. We do not want you to come here and parade your hatred of our institutions.We need people who are honest when they debate. We have challenges, nobody can run away from that. We are a developing country after all. We do not want somebody to come here and dramatise things that are not there.Opposition MP Shakespear Hamauswa intervened on a point of order.We saw on social media a publication by Hon.

According to the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights (ZADHR), over 75% of rural clinics lack electricity.The doctor-to-patient ratio stands approximately at one doctor saving 4,300 people nationally.The government has failed to implement meaningful reforms, perpetuating inequality and avoidable loss of life in under-served regions, he said.He even went further to expose the poor remuneration of health workers.Salaries for public health workers remain dismally low, ranging between USD250 and USD284 a month, barely enough to survive, comparing that to USD540 which was being earned during the Inclusive Government.He said the poor remuneration and lack of career growth, training or incentives for healthcare workers had driven more than 4,000 health professionals, including 2, 600 nurses, to leave the country in search of greener pastures.If you look at non-communicable diseases, public hospitals lack diagnostic equipment, cancer screening services and those who are diagnosed with the disease spend years on the waiting list.Makamure alleged there was no clear public record of how much was spent on procuring cancer machines or whether those machines are fully functional.\n\nMany hospital buildings and infrastructure have deteriorated significantly. Peeling paint, leaking roofs, broken windows, blocked plumbing and outdated equipment dominate once functional health institutions Makamure added.\n\nThe legislator told the acting speaker that the current physical decay did not inspire hope in patients, but deepened despair, reinforcing the perception that the lives do not matter to those in power and Parliament included.This dire situation reflects systematic or systemic neglect where under-investment, poor planning and misplaced priorities have reduced public health facilities to places of suffering.The MP stated that the erosion of basic standards in patient care was not only a humanitarian crisis but a direct violation of Zimbabwes right to health and dignity.The late Alex Magaisa (may his soul rest in peace) said: a State that cannot provide basic healthcare to its people cannot call itself sovereign, the MP told the house.He said the government was failing to guarantee the most basic condition of life, which is health.Figures speak for themselves, said Makamure before Zanu PF Chief Whip Pupurai Togarepi chipped in; We cannot allow the gentleman, whoever he is, to continue lying. Here at this Parliament, if he wants to go to the clinic here, he is going to be treated.So, for him now to start attacking the State to the point of saying we cannot call ourselves sovereign, is he supposed to be a Zimbabwean or we are dealing with some foreigner? Togarepi fumed.We are not taking what he is saying lightly. We do not want you to come here and parade your hatred of our institutions.We need people who are honest when they debate. We have challenges, nobody can run away from that. We are a developing country after all. We do not want somebody to come here and dramatise things that are not there.Opposition MP Shakespear Hamauswa intervened on a point of order.We saw on social media a publication by Hon.

            "content": "Glamour ZA\n\nFabric, flair, and fantasy! Global fashion runways ooze elegance as they are a catalyst for taste, inspiring womens wardrobes each season.Fashionis big business, according toBizplanr,the global fashion industry is currently valued at $1.84 trillion in 2025. It accounts for approximately 1.63% of the worlds GDP and is projected to grow at a 4.1% CAGR between 2024 and 2030. This makes fashion weeks integral to the ecosystem, spotlighting emerging and established talent alike. And Zimbabwe is slowly gaining momentum on that frontier.\n\nConnecting the dots at the helm of Zimbabwe Fashion Week is Priscilla Chigariro, model, interior designer, culinary creative, and, most importantly, cultural strategist. As the founder of the Zimbabwe Fashion Week Trust, she has been shaping the countrys fashion narrative since 2009. This October, she is back to orchestrate what she calls a homecoming, but also a reintroduction.\n\nThis year feels like a homecoming, but also a reintroduction. Were not just picking up where we left off, were coming back with a deeper sense ofpurpose, she says. Hosting the event at the iconic Hyatt Regency Harare (The Meikles) adds a sense of gravitas, a setting worthy of her vision. And her vision is ambitious: a fashion week that bridges Zimbabwean talent with the wider African and diaspora conversation.\n\nPriscilla sees fashion as both a business and a cultural movement. She sees a philosophy that influences everything from the lineup of shows to the conversations on sustainability. Fashion isnt just about the clothes. Its an economic driver, a storytelling medium, and a record of who we are, she explains.\n\nAfrican fashion has long battled with fragmented markets, lack of infrastructure, and limited access to international buyers. Too often, local talent gets trapped in a cycle of underfunded production and exposure limited to regional stages. Yet, within these challenges lie opportunities: a continent brimming with artisanal skill, sustainable textile traditions, and untapped consumer markets.\n\nPriscilla is addressing both ends of the equation. Through her PC Group Fashion Futures Program, she invests in emerging designers, offering mentorship, market access, and practical business skills. The Hunhu Council of Fashion, another of her initiatives, safeguards cultural heritage while promoting innovation. Theyre intertwined, she says. Fashion Futures is about long-term development, while the Hunhu Council protects and promotes African fashion heritage. ZFW is where those two worlds meet on stage.\n\nHer multidisciplinary background shapes ZFW into an experience rather than just an event. From music and staging to how guests are welcomed, every detail is curated to tell a story. My modeling background taught me presentation and detail, my design work taught me storytelling through form, and the culinary world taught me the power of hospitality, she notes.\n\nThis years shows will spotlight small-batch, artisan-led labels alongside contemporary fashion houses ready for international retail. For Priscilla, the thrill lies in the range: The excitement this year is in watching new names step onto a global stage with confidence.\n\nWhile sustainability has become a fashion buzzword, Priscilla grounds it in cultural responsibility. Its about honouring the land, the makers, and the cultural lineage behind the garments, she says. Expect slow fashion showcases, natural fibers, and artisanal techniques to be front and center, all while protecting intellectual property and ensuring that cultural narratives remain intact.\n\nForZimbabweto thrive in the global fashion economy, Priscilla believes international collaboration is essential. We cant grow in isolation. International collaboration brings resources and new perspectives, but it also allows us to share our innovations with the world. Its a two-way exchange. And her message through this revival? We belong on the global stage, and we can take our seat without losing ourselves. Zimbabwe has so much creative wealth, but its often overlooked or underestimated.\n\nAs the lights dim and the first model steps onto the runway, the energy will be electric. Zimbabwe is here, it is relevant, and it is ready for the world.\n\n",
