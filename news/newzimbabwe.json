We are finally free after a whole year of persecution. It only strengthened our resolve, Sitima said after the acquittal.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has thrown out an urgent bid by a Congolese national seeking immediate release from Harare Remand Prison, ruling that his detention is lawful under the countrys immigration laws.\n\nBenoit Ombeni Mupenzi, who claims to be a refugee in Zimbabwe, had argued that his incarceration was unlawful as he had not been informed of the reasons for his arrest nor shown a valid warrant.\n\nHe told the court that his liberty was being arbitrarily restrained, causing irreparable harm and insisted he was unaware of any offence committed.\n\nSitting at the Harare High Court, Justice Fatima Maxwell held that authorities were acting within the law.\n\nCiting section 8(1) of the Immigration Act [Chapter 4:02], the judge said, The detention of the applicant is in terms of a law which remains in our statute books. Until and unless section 8 of the Immigration Act is declared unconstitutional and such declaration is confirmed by the Constitutional Court, the courts hands are tied.\n\nThe provision gives immigration authorities up to 14 days to verify an individuals identity, nationality and antecedents.\n\nThe Chief Immigration Officer opposed Mupenzis release, stating that his nationality was still under investigation and that none of the documents he presented substantiated his claim to refugee status.\n\nApplicants identity and nationality status have been questioned by the countrys security apparatus, the court was told.\n\nThe judge acknowledged Mupenzis complaint over not being given reasons for his detention, but made it clear that release was not the remedy. Whilst applicant might have a genuine grievance that he was not furnished with reasons for the arrest and detention forthwith, I am not persuaded that the remedy for that is his immediate release, she said.\n\nThere was no order regarding costs.\n\n",

Just recently, mineral exporting companies revealed that the central bank has not been paying their 30% export surrender in local currency.\n\nThe latest decision by Bitumen Worlddemonstrates the authorities appetite to uphold currency stability even at the cost of other critical economic imperatives.\n\nThe Zimbabwean government, one of the companys largest debtors, is experiencing significant challenges in making timely payments to its contractors. The government is facing delays in settling arrears, affecting various projects, including road rehabilitation and dam construction.\n\nWhile efforts are underway to establish payment plans and small payments have been received, these financial constraints have contributed to the companys decision to realign its operations to remain resilient in a challenging fiscal environment, said the company.\n\nThe company said this necessary transition reflects a committed effort to adapt to the current economic challenges, including operating under cash flow pressures caused by delayed payments from clients.\n\nBW said it recognises and deeply values the dedication and professionalism of all its employees and is committed to handling the process with respect, transparency, and dignity, offering support to those affected through severance packages and transition assistance.\n\nBW CEO, Andre Zietsman, said the decision has been very tough but had to be made due to limited options at hand.\n\nOver recent months, we have engaged in extensive discussions and evaluations to guide Bitumen World through this difficult period. While the decision to restructure was not made lightly, it is essential for ensuring our long-term viability and ability to continue contributing meaningfully to infrastructure development in Zimbabwe and beyond, he said.\n\nHe said the employees who have worked tirelessly to restore the countrys infrastructure glory will, unfortunately, suffer heavy blows when they see their jobs going down the drain.\n\nThe tragedy of these layoffs is that they impact the very people who built this prestigious brand  a brand that was wholly created by Zimbabweans, said Zietsman.\n\nThe company committed to handling the process with respect, transparency, and dignity, offering support to those affected through severance packages and transition assistance.\n\n",

In fact, it is becoming worse and worse. I just want to remind you of that commitment that you did in Bulawayo, said Hwende.\n\nThe disgruntlement expressed by Hwende is the latest in a series of concerns raised by MPs over their poor welfare, which is marked by the late disbursement of salaries.\n\nThis, according to MPs, has been hindering them from discharging their parliamentary duties in their respective constituencies.\n\nMPs are entitled to allowances, vehicles and Community Development Funds (CDF), which are used on different projects in constituencies.\n\nIn response, the Speaker of the National Assembly, Jacob Mudenda, said the government was in the process of disbursing funds for the welfare of the legislators.\n\nWe have had a meeting with the Hon. Minister of Finance, and the matter is being handled. What is outstanding at the moment, what was paid for and other urgent matters where members were behind, including coupons, is ZWL1.5 million and what we, as Parliament, had indicated to bring all the requirements up to date, we needed ZWL5 million.\n\nI was assured that the balance of ZWL3.5 million should be paid before the end of this month. The Hon. Deputy Minister is here. That is what we have arranged, said Mudenda.\n\n",
