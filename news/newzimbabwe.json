She is dedicated to redefining the future of African storytelling.\n\nShe is the creator, executive producer, and head writer of Netflix Original Series Bad Influencer.Bad Influencer is a seven-part crime drama series that balances high-stakes survival with the glossy illusions of influencer culture.At its heart is BK (Jo-Anne Reyneke), a street-smart single mom whose greatest hustle is protecting her son. Destiny puts her in the path of Pinky (Cindy Mahlangu), a rising influencer with flair and chaos to spare.Maradzika shared with IOL that she used to be a micro-influencer and attended brand events. Although she didnt stay long, she thought it was an interesting world.I didnt stay in it, but what I kept was an interesting story which I pitched and we turned it into an idea through 18 months of development, working with my company Lincoln Green Media, also working with Gambit, who are incredible producers, to put something together that is unique and fresh for an audience.On Bad Influencer, BK and Pinky descend into Joburgs counterfeit economy, selling fake luxury handbags. Fame and fraud become indistinguishable, likes and lies trade places, and instinct demands they walk the knife-edge between heart and hustle.The series takes a look at the different social issues that come with the world of influencers. Maradzika explained that she chose to tackle this because there are many layers to the story.Theres so many layers to influencer culture, but I think whats important with the story is that its not judging in any way. Its just telling a story of two women, women who are women before their influences, or a mother, and I think thats what people all relate to most.Maradzika has been in the industry for about 11 years and has worked as a development executive at Paramount Viacom. Her work has reached global audiences through Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Showmax, MTV, BET, and Comedy Central.\n\nShe is the creator, executive producer, and head writer of Netflix Original Series Bad Influencer.\n\nBad Influencer is a seven-part crime drama series that balances high-stakes survival with the glossy illusions of influencer culture.At its heart is BK (Jo-Anne Reyneke), a street-smart single mom whose greatest hustle is protecting her son.

But on arriving, the CWUZ receptionist hurriedly accompanied me to the boardroom where I was shocked to meet a lady, who swiftly greeted me and introduced herself.\n\nHow are you? I am the CWUZ president. Please kindly take a seat, she said without wasting much time.\n\nBut who really is this woman of steel who has managed to fit in the shoes left behind by some iconic unionists like Lucia Matibenga, whose spine spurred her to greater political offices at national level?\n\nMy name is Josephine Makuwa. I am based in the Midlands provinces Kwekwe city. I am employed by OK Zimbabwe as a till controller. My journey to the top was largely inspired by the desire to stand up for other peoples rights, she said.\n\nThe CWUZ president said she is self-driven for greater heights. Hers was a long and arduous journey which began right from the grassroots as an ordinary committee member in a branch structure.\n\nI have an insatiable appetite to achieve and above all, I believe in my abilities. I also pursue opportunities for education, training and leadership development. Over and above these qualities, I invest in building connections with other women and allies who share similar goals and values with me, she said.\n\nMakuwa said during her tenure she is determined to tackle problems affecting workers in the retail sector, which includes gender-based violence (GBV), socio-cultural barriers, discriminatory laws and policies working to the disadvantage of employees.\n\nShe said she will deploy her term of office towards transforming CWUZ to build capacity which enables it to represent and advocate for members interests by empowering workers through education and training, engaging with government and employers to influence policies that benefit workers and promote economic growth and to partner with other organisations to amplify the unions impact and promote workers interests.\n\nl will make sure that there is a huge expansion in membership drive through organising and recruitment of new members to increase bargaining power and influence.\n\nCWUZ should achieve an improvement in the current working conditions by the continued negotiating for better wages and benefits through collective bargaining agreements, internal structures, governance and financial management will be strengthened to ensure long term sustainability, she said.\n\nThe CWUZ leader urged members to stay engaged and participate in the unions activities for their voices to be heard.\n\n",
