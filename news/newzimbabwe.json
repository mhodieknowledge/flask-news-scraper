During the day, he is using less high-flow oxygen.\n\nThe Pope has only been seen by the public once since he was admitted to hospital, in a photograph released by the Vatican last week, which showed him praying in a hospital chapel.\n\nEarlier this month, an audio recording of Pope Francis speaking in his native Spanish was played in St Peters Square in Vatican City.\n\nHis voice was breathless as he thanked the Catholic faithful for their prayers.\n\nPope Francis has spent nearly 12 years as leader of the Roman Catholic Church.\n\nHe has suffered a number of health issues throughout his life, including having part of one of his lungs removed at age 21, making him more prone to infections.\n\n",

Among them, is the enforcement of the reserved sectors.\n\nThe retail sectors where we have a lot of foreigners, most of whom are not even here legally, some came as refugees. This extends to other sectors including quarrying, brick moulding and sand mining, which has been invaded by foreign nationals.\n\nWe will be enforcing the law fully. We are just finalising on some of the statutory provisions which we were supposed to have instituted a few years ago when the amendments to the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act was done through the Finance Act of 2018.\n\nOnce the Statutory Instrument gives us full powers to enforce the reserved sector laws, we hope that we will be able to address this scourge which is really giving us problems at the moment, said Ndlovu.\n\nThe local currency has become dreaded by MSMEs due to its volatility, with many preferring the United States dollar. Shop owners reportedly manipulate point-of-sale machines to only accept transactions in US dollars.\n\nThis has disadvantaged the majority of consumers who earn in the local currency.\n\nNdlovu further said that his ministry will take steps to regulate the informal sector to allow the purchase of goods in all currencies.\n\nIf you follow the Monetary Policy Statement issued by the Central Bank, they have highlighted again that every registered business ought to have a point of sale machine. These are attempts to make sure that everyone operating in this country, a business affords the consumer an opportunity to swipe or to use the local currency alongside the foreign currency as they wish.\n\nI might highlight for the comfort of the House that this is a matter we are seized with where we are coming up with a comprehensive system and as we speak, officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, from our ministry and from the security agencies have been assigned to go to India where they will understudy a centralised payment system where SMEs and industry are successfully formalised and are contributing to the fiscus, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Associated Press\n\nGEORGE Foreman became the heavyweight champion of the world in his 20s, only to lose his belt to Muhammad Ali in perhaps the most memorable fight in boxing history.\n\nA full 20 years later in 1994, the 45-year-old Foreman became the oldest man to win the heavyweight championship, throwing one perfect combination to steal Michael Moorers title in an epic upset.\n\nFew fighters ever had more big moments than Big George Foreman  and even after he finally left the ring, he was only getting started.\n\nThe fearsome heavyweight, who lost the Rumble in the Jungle to Ali before his inspiring second act as a surprising champion and a successful businessman, died Friday night. Foreman was 76.\n\nForemans family announced his death on social media, not saying how or where he died.\n\nA devout preacher, a devoted husband, a loving father and a proud grand- and great-grandfather, he lived a life marked by unwavering faith, humility and purpose, his family wrote.\n\nA humanitarian, an Olympian and two-time heavyweight champion of the world, he was deeply respected. A force for good, a man of discipline, conviction, and a protector of his legacy, fighting tirelessly to preserve his good name for his family.\n\nA native Texan, Foreman began his boxing career as an Olympic gold medalist who inspired fear and awe as he climbed to the peak of the heavyweight division by stopping Joe Frazier in 1973.\n\nHis formidable aura evaporated only a year later when Ali pulled off one of the most audacious victories in boxing history in Zaire, baiting and taunting Foreman into losing his belt.\n\nForeman left the sport a few years later, but returned after a 10-year absence and a self-described religious awakening.\n\nThe middle-aged fighter then pulled off one of the most spectacular knockouts in boxing history, flooring Moorer  19 years his junior  with a surgical right hand and claiming Moorers two heavyweight belts. Foremans 20 years is easily the longest gap between heavyweight title reigns.\n\nForemans transformation into an inspirational figure was complete, and he fought only four more times  finishing 76-5 with 68 knockouts  before moving onto his next career as a genial businessman, pitchman and occasional actor.\n\nOutside the ring, he was best known as the face of the George Foreman Grill, which launched in the same year as his victory over Moorer. The simple cooking machine sold more than 100 million units and made him much wealthier than his sport ever did.\n\nGeorge was a great friend to not only myself, but to my entire family, Top Rank president Bob Arum said. Weve lost a family member and are absolutely devastated.\n\nIn the first chapter of his boxing career, Foreman was nothing like the smiling grandfather who hawked his grills on television to great success.\n\nForeman dabbled in petty crime while growing up in Houstons Fifth Ward, but changed his life through boxing. He made the U.S. Olympic team in 1968 and won gold in Mexico City as a teenager, stopping a 29-year-old opponent in a star-making performance.\n\nForeman rose to the pinnacle of the pro game over the next five years, but was also perceived as an aloof, unfriendly athlete, both through his demeanor and through the skewed racial lenses of the time.\n\nJim Lampley, the veteran boxing broadcaster who worked alongside Foreman for many years at HBO, told The Associated Press on Friday night that Foremans initial demeanor was an attempt by his camp to emulate Sonny Liston, the glowering heavyweight champ of the 1960s.\n\nAt some point somewhere along the way, he realized that wasnt him, Lampley said.\n\nForeman stopped Frazier in an upset in Jamaica in January 1973 to win the belt, with his knockout inspiring Howard Cosells iconic call: Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!\n\nForeman defended his belt against Ken Norton before accepting the fight with Ali in the now-immortal bout staged in Africa by promoter Don King. Ali put on a tactical masterclass against Foreman, showing off the rope-a-dope strategy that frustrated and infuriated the champion. Foreman was eventually knocked down for the first time in his career, and the fight was stopped in the eighth round.\n\nForeman told the BBC in 2014 that he took the fight almost out of charity to Ali, who he suspected to be broke.\n\nI said I was going to go out there and kill him, and people said, Please, dont say youre going to kill Muhammad, Foreman said. So I said, OK, Ill just beat him down to the ground. Thats how easy I thought the fight would be.\n\nExhausted and disillusioned, Foreman stopped fighting in 1977 and largely spent the next decade preaching and working with kids in Houston after his religious awakening. He returned to boxing in 1987 in his late 30s with a plan to defy time through frequent ring appearances, and he racked up a lengthy series of victories before losing to Evander Holyfield in a surprisingly competitive title fight in 1991.\n\nThree years later, Foreman got in the ring with Moorer in Las Vegas, more for his celebrity than for his perceived ability to beat Moorer. The champion appeared to win the first nine rounds rather comfortably, with Foreman unable to land his slower punches. But Foreman came alive in the 10th, hurting Moorer before slipping in the short right hand that sent Moorer to the canvas in earth-shaking fashion.\n\nLampley, who was calling the fight, named his upcoming autobiography  which includes a prologue about Foreman  after his famous call of that moment: It Happened!\n\nForeman quit the ring for good in 1997, although he occasionally discussed a comeback. He settled into a life as a boxing analyst for HBO and as a pitchman for the grills that grew his fame and fortune. Much of the world soon knew Foreman as both a lovable friend and a ferocious fighter.\n\nHe started performing as this pitchman, this product pitchman with the big, ever-present giant grin on his face, Lampley recalled. When I was working with him, people would say, George is a big clown.\n\nAnd I would say, Well, you can call him a clown, but hes actually a genius. He may be the greatest genius Ive ever met. And people would say, Well, genius, what do you mean? Id say, Well, check the bank account. If that isnt proof enough, I dont know what is. So, he was a genius. He was a human genius.\n\nForeman briefly starred in a sitcom called George in the 1990s, and he even appeared on the reality singing competition The Masked Singer in 2022.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nPROPERTY belonging to a Zanu PF member was Thursday destroyed by suspected fellow party activists during a nocturnal raid in Zvimba, Mashonaland West province, as intra-party violence escalates in the ruling establishment.\n\nGifford Gomwe had his vehicle and house destroyed for allegedly bravely coming out to vociferously resist President Emmerson Mnangagwas supporters push to extend his rule beyond his constitutionally-permissible two five-year terms.\n\nGifford Gomwe\n\nGomwe, who faced off with Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi during the 2023 Zanu PF primaries in which both eventually lost to current Labour deputy minister Mercy Maruva-Dinha, is counting his loss after unknown assailants descended on his homestead Thursday night.\n\nThe attackers, seemingly on a terror mission, didnt take away any valuables but targeted a double-cab vehicle whose windows and lights they shattered using unknown objects. They also smashed window panes around the house before fleeing.\n\nGomwe confirmed the incident to NewZimbabwe.com in a telephone interview.\n\nThe incident happened while l was away in Harare for work but one of my relatives was there. The assailants were clearly on a mission to intimidate me because all they did was to vandalise my property and didnt take away anything of value, Gomwe told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nPolice attended the scene but until the time of publishing, no suspect had been arrested.\n\nHowever, Gomwe is convinced the attack was politically-motivated.\n\nThis is clearly the work of fellow Zanu PF comrades who want to silence me because l have been vocal in resisting the 2030 agenda to have President Emmerson Mnangagwas term extended beyond 2028. I am taking that stance because l am a constitutionalist, said Gomwe, who insists he is still a Zanu PF member despite a recent Politburo decision to expel him.\n\nI was never served with a charge sheet nor given an opportunity to respond to the allegations. Also, the expulsion was never formally communicated to me, l only learnt about it through social media and the very same people pushing for my expulsion were the ones behind the attack at my home.\n\nLosers from the 2023 elections such as Ziyambi and others were allegedly angered by those pushing back calls for Mnangagwa to perpetuate his rule, Gomwe opined.\n\nIndividuals who lost elections and went on to benefit from President Mnangagwas appointments are the ones agitating for him to cling to power, which l personally disagree with, he added.\n\nIn a public statement, Gomwe noted that the recent attack at his homestead would not shake his resolve to ensure Zanu PF observes the party and national constitutions.\n\nI stand unwavering and unshaken by the recent vandalism incident at my rural homestead in Zvimba. This cowardly and barbaric act will not intimidate me, nor will it deter our collective march towards a brighter future.\n\nThe damaged car\n\nSuch acts of violence and intimidation only serve to expose the desperation and fear of those who seek to undermine our progress, he wrote.\n\nLet me be clear: these tactics will not succeed. The revolution that seeks to emancipate our people and bring us to greater heights will not be stopped by senseless acts of destruction.\n\nTo the perpetrators, you will face the full wrath of the law. Justice will be served, and you will be held accountable for your actions.\n\nTo my fellow comrades, let us stand strong and united in the face of such cowardice. Let us continue to push forward, undeterred, towards a future that is brighter, more just, and more equal for all. Aluta continua.\n\n",

Sections within the party want him to hang on until 2030 despite the Constitution declaring that he should vacate office in 2028 after two terms in office.\n\nThis, argues Geza, is wrong, unfair, corrupt and the reason why Zimbabwes army is backing his deputy Constantino Chiwenga to take over, in factional fights bedeviling the ruling party.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Defence Forces further note with concern, the continued misuse of military uniform by some members of the public, reads the statement.\n\nThe public is advised that according to the Defence Act (Chapter 11:02), the abuse of military uniform is an offence which prohibits and criminalises the wearing of military uniform by individuals who are not members of the Defence Forces.\n\nAny person who without authority wears or uses any decoration supplied to or authorised for use by any member of the Defence Forces or other military forces or any decoration so nearly resembling such decoration as to be likely to deceive shall be guilty of an offence.\n\nMembers of the public are therefore urged to desist from acquiring or wearing any items of military uniform or apparel resembling such. Those caught on the wrong side of the law will be prosecuted.\n\nMembers of the public are also urged to report to the Zimbabwe Republic Police or the Zimbabwe Military Police any persons seen wearing military uniforms outside cantonment and other designated areas, or those committing crimes on the pretext that they are members of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces.\n\nDespite the statement, Geza, who is on the polices wanted list on charges of inciting violence and undermining the authority of the president, is widely believed to be enjoying the security and support of Zimbabwes army.\n\nHe is widely believed to be pushing an agenda whose interests are in sync with the armys, the installment of Chiwenga as President.\n\n",
