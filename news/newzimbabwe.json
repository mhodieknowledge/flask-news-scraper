            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court of Zimbabwe has reinstated magistrate Sandra Mupindu as a trustee of the Shamba Charashika Bvumavaranda Trust, overturning what it described as a procedurally flawed amendment to the trust deed by her estranged husband, Simon Mupindu.\n\nThe couple is going through a nasty divorce after Simon, a top Harare lawyer ditched the magistrate for his former intern, Catherine Tatenda Chitopota.Simon is the one who has filed for divorce and the matter is still pending.Simon, now based in Chivhu, is also suing Chitopota for adultery.Sandra told the High Court that Simon replaced her with Chitopota in the trust prompting her to approach the courts for redress.Justice Vivian Ndlovu sitting at the Harare High Court ruled in favour of Sandra declaring the Notarial Deed of Amendment to the trustregistered in 2023to be null, void, and of no effect.The court found that both her removal and the appointment of a new trustee, Chitopota, were unlawful.The removal of the applicant as a trustee was not procedurally done, the judge wrote in the ruling.The appointment of the third respondent as a trustee was not procedurally done either. The applicant is entitled to the declaratory order sought.Sandra had alleged that she was removed from the trust without her knowledge or consent and that her signature was fraudulently appended to documents purporting to authorise the change.She also claimed that two properties held under the trust were sold without her involvement.The trust, established in 2014 and meant to safeguard family assets and benefit the couples children, had listed both Sandra and Simon Mupindu as trustees.The court noted that Simons unilateral actions violated the terms of the original trust deed, which specified that only beneficiaries could alter trustee appointments.Simon had argued that the trust was his initiative and claimed his wifes role was symbolic.However, the court dismissed his arguments and those of the other respondents, including his legal firm Mupindu Legal Practitioners, and Chitopota.The fourth respondent, the Registrar of Deeds, did not oppose the application and has been ordered to amend official records accordingly.Justice Ndlovu also dismissed all preliminary objections raised by the respondents, including claims of lis pendens (pending litigation), material falsehoods, and misjoinder.In a stinging rebuke, the judge ordered Simon Mupindu, Chitopota, and the law firm to pay costs on a legal practitioner-client scale.\n\nThe couple is going through a nasty divorce after Simon, a top Harare lawyer ditched the magistrate for his former intern, Catherine Tatenda Chitopota.\n\nSimon is the one who has filed for divorce and the matter is still pending.Simon, now based in Chivhu, is also suing Chitopota for adultery.Sandra told the High Court that Simon replaced her with Chitopota in the trust prompting her to approach the courts for redress.Justice Vivian Ndlovu sitting at the Harare High Court ruled in favour of Sandra declaring the Notarial Deed of Amendment to the trustregistered in 2023to be null, void, and of no effect.The court found that both her removal and the appointment of a new trustee, Chitopota, were unlawful.The removal of the applicant as a trustee was not procedurally done, the judge wrote in the ruling.The appointment of the third respondent as a trustee was not procedurally done either.

            "content": "By Simon Majadibodu l IOL\n\nZIMBABWES ruling party has come out strongly against a proposed US bill that could sanction ANC leaders, urging South Africa to stay firm and resist foreign intimidation.\n\nZanu PF says South Africa should not be intimidated by a proposed US bill that could empower President Donald Trump with superpowers to impose sanctions on African National Congress (ANC) leaders.Zanu PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa said the United States should not misdirect itself in its diplomatic relations with South Africa.These issues could be resolved without resorting to sanctions. But if America decides to go its own way, so be it  weve had over two decades of experience dealing with sanctions, Mutsvangwa said.He made the comments on Friday at the ANCs 2025 Liberation Movements Summit in Kempton Park.He said the US previous sanctions on Zimbabwe had not derailed the countrys progress.They have not stopped Zimbabwe from making progress. On the contrary, we are now potentially the most dynamic economy on the African continent, Mutsvangwa told Newzroom Afrika.Who would have thought that Zimbabwe would now be developing a third-world steel industry  one that even America might look at with a bit of jealousy?Last year, the US imposed sanctions on Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, accusing him of serious human rights violations after his disputed victory in the 2023 elections.Relations between Washington and Harare have been strained for more than 20 years.The US initially imposed economic and travel sanctions on Zimbabwe in the early 2000s, targeting the late President Robert Mugabe and several senior government officials, accusing them of eroding democratic principles.However, on March 4, 2024, former President Joe Biden officially ended the US sanctions programme against Zimbabwe, lifting restrictions on all previously sanctioned individuals, entities, and assets under that policy.He encouraged South Africa to view the situation from a more optimistic perspective.Dont worry about being pushed around by superpowers. Weve travelled that road before. We share experiences, and we have the resources anyway, he added.This comes after reports that the US Congressman Ronny Jackson introduced the US and South Africa Bilateral Relations Review Act of 2025, a bill that could sanction ANC leaders for allegedly supporting US adversaries, including China, Russia and Iran.On Thursday, President Cyril Ramaphosa addressed the issue while visiting BMW South Africa.Weve heard what has happened in the House Committee, but the process still has a long way to go, Ramaphosa said.Our bilateral dealings and engagements with the United States will continue, and well talk about all manner of things  including this issue.Ramaphosa added that South Africa values its diplomatic relations with the US and hopes to strengthen them through continued dialogue.We are very positive that the outcome of our engagements with the United States will be comprehensive and all-encompassing, so we can return to good deals with the United States, he said.IOL News previously reported that the ANC said it is pinning its hopes on Democrats in the US Congress, particularly those who supported the anti-apartheid movement, to block the bill.There are many Democrats, including those who were part of the anti-apartheid movements, who will stand up to caution Americans against supporting a president who wants to censor and undermine the sovereignty of other nations, said ANC spokesperson Mahlengi Bhengu-Motsiri.Bengu-Motsiri said the ANC will vigorously oppose any attempt to isolate it through renewed sanctions.Remember, we come from a history where sanctions were imposed against the apartheid system, she said. The ANC was also isolated by countries that worked closely with the apartheid regime, including the United States.The bill, which was passed through the House Foreign Affairs and Judiciary Committees, will now be presented before the full US House of Representatives for a vote.\n\nZanu PF says South Africa should not be intimidated by a proposed US bill that could empower President Donald Trump with superpowers to impose sanctions on African National Congress (ANC) leaders.\n\nZanu PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa said the United States should not misdirect itself in its diplomatic relations with South Africa.These issues could be resolved without resorting to sanctions.

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, we understand the Minister for Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs recently issued Statutory Instrument 76 of 2025, aiming to digitise titledeedsin Zimbabwe, why now?\n\nVM: Thank you\n\nI think there is a need to understand these legal developments in context. The Deeds Registry is probably one of the most important offices in our country, housing and keeping records of our security documents, including property titles, charitable or family trusts, and financial security instruments such as mortgage bonds. Established through the Deeds Registry Act of 1960, consecutive governments, through various regulations made several attempts over the years to maintain utmost security over the documents and their registry in changing times.\n\nRecent cases alleging in deed registration processes either through collusion with staff members in the deeds registration process or outright forgery, case in point, the Matumbuka case, have necessitated further security measures in line with International best practices, already undergoing implementation in other jurisdictions like South Africa, Namibia, Australia and the United Kingdom. I mention these countries because a significant number of our diaspora are residents there.\n\nHence, these new regulations\n\nReporter: What will be the new look of the digital title deed?\n\nVM: The idea is to standardise the title deeds to be issued going forward. This will include the titles being on special security paper supplied by a single supplier so it is easily identifiable and verifiable. Further, how the title deed will be drawn up will also be prescribed for the conveyancers, this will include font size, type of ink, what happens when the alterations are on the deedet cetera.\n\nThe digital copy will be maintained at the deeds office, and a physical copy with the above features issued to the deed owner.\n\nThe import is to reduce the options for fraud.\n\nReporter: What happens to the title deeds that were issued before the statutory instrument publication?\n\nVM: That is a good question. The new regulations acknowledge the new securitised deeds and the old title deeds, which refer to the deeds people are holding in Zimbabwe as of this date.\n\nThe idea is to integrate the current title deeds to become securitised deeds within 24 months.\n\nThis means that the holders of current title deeds are required to submit their original title deeds and documents to the deeds registry within 24 months so that they are validated. The Registrar will then check whether the documents comply with the regulations. Once the documents are validated, the Registrar will issue the securitised deed on special paper to the holder of title and a digital copy will be maintained at the Registrars office.\n\nWe are anticipating a supporting implementation framework from the Registrars office on how the process will be implemented in actual terms, including the attendant fees.\n\nReporter: What other measures have also been introduced to ensure that the securitised deeds system is secure?\n\nVM: The regulations prescribe that lawyers follow strict identity procedures when drafting deeds and power of attorney. There is a requirement that the documents be notarised. Digital log-ins on the system will be traceable for any person dealing with a particular property in the securitised system, which will allow for a digital footprint should any work be attended to on a particular securitised deed.\n\nLong and short, it will be easier for the authorities to identify when and by who should a complaint be made on a certain deed.\n\nIn addition, criminal sanctions for fraud have been included in the regulations which target Registry or government employees who collude with or assist fraudsters to tamper with deeds.\n\nReporter: Mr. Madzima, what is your personal view on the new system?\n\nVM: I believe the system will go a long way in modernising our deeds registration system by improving security and transparency, thereby reducing instances of fraud involving the deeds office or peoples property titles. It will also assist property practitioners in verification of title processes as it will be more efficient and reliable from away from the manual paper system to a digital and more efficient system.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have to end here because of our time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

We are not only issuing mining claims but also providing equipment so they can actively participate in the mining value chain.\n\nHe revealed plans to drill boreholes in each of Zimbabwes 35,000 villages.\n\nThis, he said, would underpin agro-based, community-managed businesses to tackle food insecurity, boost horticultural exports, and lift rural incomes.\n\nThese initiatives are mitigating the impact of climate change and guaranteeing household food security, he said.\n\nMnangagwas remarks come at a time when Zimbabwe continues to grapple with hyperinflation, high unemploymentparticularly among the youthcrippling infrastructure, and the lingering effects of prolonged international sanctions.\n\nYet, the president projected optimism, citing a projected 6% GDP growth this year, underpinned by multi-pronged policy reforms.\n\nKey to Zimbabwes vision, Mnangagwa said, is a modernised education sector geared towards innovation and technological advancement.\n\nHe urged African nations to explore new financing models and deepen regional trade ties.\n\nLet us not shy away from looking at new financing models and partnerships. The education sector should be the bedrock of innovation and science, he said, calling for bold policy frameworks and government procurement quotas to support youth-led startups.\n\nWomen and young people are central to Zimbabwes recovery blueprint.\n\nMechanisation programmes are driving agricultural productivity among youth, while youth- and women-led consortia are now active in infrastructure development across the country.\n\nMnangagwa also reaffirmed his governments commitment to honouring liberation war veterans with income-enhancing programmes and called for renewed focus on Pan-African economic cooperation.\n\nIn the true spirit of Pan-Africanism and regional integration, let us do more to promote trade among our countries.\n\nWhile critics argue more tangible reforms were needed to stem corruption and unlock foreign investment, Mnangagwas speech signalled a vision of empowerment rooted in grassroots resilience and continental unity.\n\n",

It is our strong position that those on duty must be held accountable and prosecuted for their negligence, which resulted in this costly disaster, he said.\n\nNgadziore said looking ahead, the only lasting solution is a comprehensive redevelopment of the Glenview SMEs Complex.\n\nMore than 4,000 traders operate from the precinct confirming the significant economic contribution of SMEs to the local economy.\n\nGoing into the future, the committee said it is advocating for a comprehensive redevelopment of the complex through a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) guided by urban planning and fire safety regulations, to replan and modernise the facility.\n\nTo this end development, construction of a new Peoples Market nearby is expected to begin soon.\n\nThis initiative will create over 30 modern kiosks, providing a safer and more dignified environment for traders.\n\n",
