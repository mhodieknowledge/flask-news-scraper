            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA PROMINENT white commercial farmer, Daniel Brink Bosman, is at the centre of controversy after allegedly piercing the skull of a 12-year-old boy with the front-end of a combine harvester, leading to the childs death in 2022.\n\nThe tragedy occurred at Dandreanum farm in Lions Den, on the outskirts of Chinhoyi, Mashonaland West, when the victim, Suarance Moffat, and two other minors were marvelling and cheering on the farmer as he steered the giant machine across his maize field.\n\nAccording to the now deceased boys parents, the farmer, for unknown reasons, drove the harvester towards the children and started chasing them, striking Suarance with a sharp object from the machine.\n\nThe late Suarance, far right in red T-shirt, with his aunt and siblings.\n\nThe bereaved family is convinced that at the time of the incident, Bosman connived with one of his drivers, Douglas Zhanewo to concoct circumstances surrounding the boys death.\n\nThe victims father, Tichaona Moffat, told NewZimbabwe.com that in 2022, after the tragedy, Bosman then proceeded to Murereka Police Station, where he made a false report stating that his tractor driver, Zhanewo, had run over the child.\n\nThe employee was subsequently arrested and appeared in court on a culpable homicide charge. This is despite our vehement denial that our boy had not been run over by a tractor, which weighs so much it could have flattened his body, said Moffat.\n\nInstead, we noticed that there was a deep cut on his head, which was corroborated by the postmortem results. So, this narrative that he had been run over was a blue lie to cover up for murder deliberately committed by Bosman, who chased the minors before killing my son, he added.\n\nMoffat painted a gory picture, as narrated by his other son who witnessed the tragedy, of Suarences body dangling from the fork on the combine harvester bleeding profusely until he died. Thereafter, Moffat further claimed, Bosman instructed a terrified Zhanewo to remove the body which they later dumped near his homestead.\n\nAt the purported scene of the accident, there was no sign of blood at all. This suggests the incident happened elsewhere and the body was dumped where it was found as a broader plot to conceal the murder. Despite raising all these facts, the police are reluctant to arrest Bosman and l strongly suspect money is exchanging hands, said Moffat.\n\nA postmortem conducted by Dr. Ivene Maponga on May 24, 2022, concluded that the boys death resulted from a deep laceration on the head, causing a perforation of the skull.\n\nAs a result, Zhanewo was discharged in 2024 following the conclusion of the State case under Number CHN/CD/1983/24, which established that the deceased had not been run over by a tractor.\n\nThe slain boys family says it has not known peace ever since the unfortunate 2022 incident, which claimed the life of their second-born child.\n\nIn a desperate bid to seek justice,Moffat recently opened a fresh case against Bosman.\n\nThe victims father Tichaona Moffat and mother\n\nAs is tradition, a memorial service should have been held for our murdered son but until now nothing has been done because our boy Suarances soul is not resting. We demand Bosmans immediate arrest so that he is prosecuted as an accused person, not as an informant, said Moffat.\n\nResultantly, police have since opened a murder case against Bosman under CR Number 45/04/25, as well as a case for filing a false report, CR Number 46/04/25.\n\nHowever, Bosman has not yet been arrested.\n\nZimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) Mashonaland West spokesperson, Inspector Ian Kohwera professed ignorance over the case.\n\nThe family, which suspects corruption which also involves National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) officials, has intensified pressure, through its lawyer Tungamirai Chamutsa of Chamutsa and Partners Legal Practitioners, to have Bosman arrested for murder.\n\nIn a letter to District Public Prosecutor, Herald Matura, officially received on May 15, 2025, the late Suarances father demanded justice to take its course.\n\nOn 11 April 2025 our client reported criminal allegations against the above accused person (Bosman), of murder of his child Suarance Moffat and making a false report as defined in the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act (Chapter 9:23).\n\nStatements were recorded at Murereka Police Station from our client and his son Junior Mephis Moffat (a juvenile) on the same day However, a docket of road traffic culpable homicide was opened wrote the lawyers.\n\nThe same Chinhoyi Traffic police arrested and investigated the wrong person on the same facts under CR28/05/22.\n\nThey arrested and charged Douglas Zhanewo with road traffic culpable homicide despite protestation from our client that his son, Suarance Moffat, was not killed by the tractor which was being driven by Douglas Zhanewo, further argued the lawyers.\n\nOur client reported a case of murder against the accused person, but Chinhoyi Traffic preferred a charge of culpable homicide arising out of a road accident.\n\nFurther, they distilled the original report of the eyewitness Junior Mephis Moffat. Kindly compare the typed statement of the witness dated 9/04/25 and the handwritten statement recorded at Murereka Police Station on 11 April 2025. Key names of participants and vital materials which are in the long-hand statement, are missing in the typed statement.\n\nOur client is baffled by the statement self-recorded by the investigating officer, one Muchihwa Misheck, dated 16 May 2025, a date which we are yet to live and see. In that statement, what is disturbing is the attitude of Mr Muchihwa in which he is discounting the credibility of other witnesses and evidence. This is outside the investigating officers jurisdiction and purview, Chamutsa wrote.\n\nThe lawyers also noted that the wheels of justice are turning slowly.\n\nWe are, therefore, instructed to inform you, as we hereby do, that our client strongly thinks that it is in the interest of justice that the accused Daniel Brink Bosman be charged with the crime of murder as defined in section 47(1) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act Chapter 9:23\n\nThis is said so because there is reasonable suspicion that he killed our clients child, one Suarance Moffat. A prima facie case for the prosecution can be raised, Chamutsa wrote.\n\nWhen contacted for comment on the matter, Bosman refused to shed light on the tragic incident and subsequent allegations raised against him.\n\nI am not at liberty to comment as this matter is still in the courts, Bosman told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nTHE Centre for Natural Resource Governance (CNRG) has blasted the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) for issuing permits to Save Valley Conservancy to kill 50 elephants, describing the move as misleading and unethical.\n\nZimParks earlier this week said the culling of 50 jumbos was to curb overpopulation, which exceeds the carrying capacity of Zimbabwes national parks.According to the 2024 aerial survey, there are 2,550 elephants against an ecological carrying capacity of 800 elephants in Save Valley Conservancy.In a statement, CNRG said the culling presented as an elephant management exercise, ignores scientific and humane alternatives, risks harming tourism, and may be driven by hidden commercial interests.While we acknowledge the ecological pressures within Save Valley Conservancy and the challenges posed by elephant overpopulation, we reject culling as a legitimate, ethical, or science-backed solution.Culling is a violent, short-term fix that disregards the complex social structures of elephant herds, risks traumatizing surviving animals, and ultimately fails to address the root causes of habitat stress and human-elephant conflict, CNRG said.Instead of killing, the environmental watchdog also argued that a broader national strategy focused on elephant range expansion, ecological corridors, and humane alternatives like contraception and community engagement is urgently needed.What is needed is a national strategy on elephant range expansion, ecological corridors, and increased investment in trans-boundary elephant conservation. Contraceptive methods, community engagement, and landscape restoration offer far more humane and sustainable options than state-sanctioned killing, CNRG added.The elephant meat from the management exercise will be distributed to local communities.CNRG believes the planned distribution of elephant meat to communities masks what may be a veiled effort to generate ivory stockpiles accusing the government of using conservation as a cover for exploiting wildlife for profit.We are also concerned that the proposed culls ultimately serve the interests of those who stand to benefit from the commercial exploitation of threatened wildlife populations.CNRG noted the militarised and extractive approach to wildlife governance that continues to exclude communities from decision-making will only escalate conflict and deepen mistrust.\n\nZimParks earlier this week said the culling of 50 jumbos was to curb overpopulation, which exceeds the carrying capacity of Zimbabwes national parks.\n\nAccording to the 2024 aerial survey, there are 2,550 elephants against an ecological carrying capacity of 800 elephants in Save Valley Conservancy.In a statement, CNRG said the culling presented as an elephant management exercise, ignores scientific and humane alternatives, risks harming tourism, and may be driven by hidden commercial interests.While we acknowledge the ecological pressures within Save Valley Conservancy and the challenges posed by elephant overpopulation, we reject culling as a legitimate, ethical, or science-backed solution.Culling is a violent, short-term fix that disregards the complex social structures of elephant herds, risks traumatizing surviving animals, and ultimately fails to address the root causes of habitat stress and human-elephant conflict, CNRG said.Instead of killing, the environmental watchdog also argued that a broader national strategy focused on elephant range expansion, ecological corridors, and humane alternatives like contraception and community engagement is urgently needed.What is needed is a national strategy on elephant range expansion, ecological corridors, and increased investment in trans-boundary elephant conservation.

They are now abusing Statutory Instrument 45 of 2013, which gives the right to employers and employees to waiver and is also very clear on the requirements of waiver, added Mazarura.\n\nThat such dishonesty has the net effect of disturbing harmony in the industry as it has a huge bearing on collective bargaining.\n\nHe revealed that for over a year now, the construction sector has been experiencing difficulties in negotiating salary and wages since such unscrupulous employers, including many without any business with government, had resorted to hiding behind the empty lies.Most of the times when we engage for negotiations the response we get is that the government is failing to pay the contractors, but we are aware that we do have some contractors who are not contracted by the government and they are just not paying or increasing wages citing late payments by the government, said Mazarura.ZCATWU contends that the industry has the capacity to pay decent wages and appealed to the contractors representatives to advise some employers, who are not contracted by the government to utilise their Works Council platforms to complement the National Employment Council (NEC) efforts.He castigated the sectors employers for leaving workers to reel under poverty conditions despite having the capacity to pay.We also have foreign companies operating their businesses and are not willing to increase wages based on government contracts.The industry is now riddled with several challenges as employers are now seeking to be exempted from paying gazette wages.
