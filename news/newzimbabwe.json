            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nERIC Niyonsaba, a Ugandan national and businessman, has demanded retraction of articles on popular site Bus Stop TV and Zim Times, both of which accused him of harbouring and financing Rwandese Intelligence Service operatives killing suspects of the 1994 genocide.\n\nNiyonsaba, who owns Fresh Kambucha Zimbabwe, gave the two publications 12 hours to act, in letters sent on May 23 by his lawyer Admire Rubaya.Failure, he said, will result in his client instituting legal proceedings, to get managers of both publications arrested and prosecuted for malicious damage to his clients image and that of his company.The letter was also copied to Police Commissioner General Stephen Mutamba.Circumstances are that the two produced a report indicating Niyonsaba as one of many Ugandan nationals running cover companies, including tuckshops, that were financing Rwandan secret service operatives in an operation targeting suspects of the world infamous 1994 genocide.The article was titled Kagame intelligence agents allegedly involved in killings of genocide suspects in Zimbabwe.The statement that you published on your website is defamatory and was understood by a reasonable reader, follower or social media user that our client is an illicit business which is a front for the Rwandan Intelligence services which houses terrorists and criminals who are killing people allegedly connected to the Rwanda 1994 genocide, said Rubaya in the letter.You have actively discouraged your followers and other social media users from purchasing the product (Fresh Kambucha), thereby potentially harming our clients reputation and business interests.He has no connection whatsoever to the Rwandan Intelligence Services or any of the individuals that you alleged he works with to fund the alleged extra judicial killings.He does not house any terrorists who are allegedly conducting the alleged extra judicial killings and that he is not involved in spying for the Rwandan Intelligence Services.Further allegations that Fresh Kambucha had not undergone rigorous tests to prove its safety, were said to have significantly affected Niyonsabas business.Added Rubaya: Our client has a traceable record of clean and well manufactured Kambucha drinks, which have been scientifically tested to the extent that no adverse report has been authored by the relevant authorities.Our client is a genuine international investor who originates from the great country of Uganda, which is led by the African son Yoweri Kaguta Museveni. He is lawfully in Zimbabwe and is just but a pure businessman who is creating employment for Zimbabweans and contributing to the national fiscus.Our clients reputation has been severely damaged and now on the verge of losing many lucrative contracts and has the real risk of being declared the enemy of the peace-loving Zimbabwean government and being called a person of interest by the Zimbabwean law enforcement agents.We enjoin you to take these allegations seriously, failing which you will only have yourselves to blame.In the event that you fail to retract the defamatory statement as demanded our client shall proceed to issue summons and claim damages for defamation as well as lodge a criminal complaint against those who run the website and/or your social media pages without any further notice to you.\n\nNiyonsaba, who owns Fresh Kambucha Zimbabwe, gave the two publications 12 hours to act, in letters sent on May 23 by his lawyer Admire Rubaya.\n\nFailure, he said, will result in his client instituting legal proceedings, to get managers of both publications arrested and prosecuted for malicious damage to his clients image and that of his company.The letter was also copied to Police Commissioner General Stephen Mutamba.Circumstances are that the two produced a report indicating Niyonsaba as one of many Ugandan nationals running cover companies, including tuckshops, that were financing Rwandan secret service operatives in an operation targeting suspects of the world infamous 1994 genocide.The article was titled Kagame intelligence agents allegedly involved in killings of genocide suspects in Zimbabwe.The statement that you published on your website is defamatory and was understood by a reasonable reader, follower or social media user that our client is an illicit business which is a front for the Rwandan Intelligence services which houses terrorists and criminals who are killing people allegedly connected to the Rwanda 1994 genocide, said Rubaya in the letter.You have actively discouraged your followers and other social media users from purchasing the product (Fresh Kambucha), thereby potentially harming our clients reputation and business interests.He has no connection whatsoever to the Rwandan Intelligence Services or any of the individuals that you alleged he works with to fund the alleged extra judicial killings.He does not house any terrorists who are allegedly conducting the alleged extra judicial killings and that he is not involved in spying for the Rwandan Intelligence Services.Further allegations that Fresh Kambucha had not undergone rigorous tests to prove its safety, were said to have significantly affected Niyonsabas business.Added Rubaya: Our client has a traceable record of clean and well manufactured Kambucha drinks, which have been scientifically tested to the extent that no adverse report has been authored by the relevant authorities.Our client is a genuine international investor who originates from the great country of Uganda, which is led by the African son Yoweri Kaguta Museveni.

What is being done to educators in Zimbabwe is a violation of both our Constitution and our humanity, said Masaraure.ARTUZ has called upon the media, civil society and other stakeholders to stand in solidarity with teachers in their quest for what the union describes as a just, equitable and rights-based education system in Zimbabwe.Against this backdrop, the Zimbabwean government continues to grapple with the challenge of paying civil servants a living wage, with similar grievances being raised by lecturers and staff across State universities.\n\nIn correspondence submitted to the ZHRC, the union detailed a series of incidents in which teachers have not only been underpaid but have also suffered a litany of infringements upon their constitutional rights.\n\nIn a statement, ARTUZ president Obert Masaraure said teachers had alerted the ZHRC to what they describe as the governments ongoing violations of labour and human rights.The Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) has today, 23 May 2025, officially submitted a detailed complaint to the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC), highlighting the governments sustained and systematic violation of teachers fundamental rights, said Masaraure.He added: The complaint outlines serious breaches of constitutional and labour rights including:1) Denial of the right to a fair wage (Section 65(1) of the Constitution)2) Suppression of the right to strike and freedom of protest,3) Refusal to honour the right to collective bargaining (Section 65(5),4) Infringement of womens rights through denial of absolute paid maternity leave.The union maintains that these complaints are substantiated by legal arguments referencing both international labour standards and regional precedents, and has called upon the ZHRC to intervene.ARTUZ is demanding that the government pays teachers a fair and living wage of at least US$1,260 per month, guarantee the constitutional right to strike and peaceful protest, align the Public Service Act and its regulations with the Constitution, uphold womens labour rights by granting absolute paid maternity leave, and foster genuine dialogue with trade unions to rebuild a meaningful social contract.The union further claims to have meticulously documented cases of harassment, unlawful dismissal, intimidation, and the systematic silencing of educators who speak out or demand justice.Masaraure cited the arrest and protracted trial of ARTUZ secretary general Robson Chere, as well as the punitive disciplinary measures imposed on more than 50 union members for their lawful participation in strikes and peaceful picketing, as illustrative examples.Our teachers are not demanding miracles  they are demanding justice.

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/essential-nutrients-for-growing-hydroponic-plants/",
            "content": "Hydroponics has revolutionized gardening and farming by eliminating the need for soil, allowing plants to grow faster, healthier, and more efficiently. At the heart of every successful hydroponic system lies a critical factor: hydroponic nutrients. These nutrient solutions are the life source for plants, replacing the traditional minerals and organic matter found in soil.\n\nUnderstanding hydroponic nutrients  how they work, how to manage them, and how to optimize their use  is key to achieving strong yields and healthy plants. Whether youre just starting with hydroponics or scaling up to a commercial setup, mastering nutrients is a must.\n\nIn hydroponic systems, plants depend entirely on the grower for their nutritional needs. Unlike traditional farming, where soil acts as a buffer and nutrient reservoir, hydroponics delivers nutrients directly through water. This direct delivery means plants absorb essential elements faster and more efficiently, leading to faster growth cycles andbigger harvests.\n\nHydroponic nutrients include a mix of macronutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), along with secondary elements such as calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. Trace minerals like iron, manganese, boron, and zinc are equally vital, supporting photosynthesis, cell structure, and root development.\n\nBy precisely controlling nutrient levels, growers can tailor feeding schedules to each plants growth stage, dramatically improving outcomes.\n\nNot all nutrient solutions are created equal. Some are designed for general use, while others are tailored for specific crops like leafy greens, herbs, or fruiting plants. The choice of nutrients also depends on the type of hydroponic system being used  for instance, deep water culture (DWC) systems often need slightly different nutrient balances than drip irrigation setups.\n\nBeginners often start withpre-formulated hydroponic nutrients, which offer balanced profiles for a range of plants. Advanced growers might customize their own blends to fine-tune nutrient delivery. Monitoring factors like electrical conductivity (EC) and pH ensures that plants are receiving exactly what they need without risking deficiencies or toxicities.\n\nGrowers serious about optimizing their setups often turn to top hydroponic nutrient techniques to maintain peak system performance and avoid common pitfalls.\n\nStarting with hydroponic nutrients can seem overwhelming at first, but it becomes second nature with practice. Beginners should focus on understanding three key aspects: nutrient types, concentration levels, and pH control.\n\nPre-mixed nutrient solutions specifically formulated for beginners offer a reliable starting point. Many are labeled according to plant type or growth stage (vegetative vs flowering), making selection easier. Monitoring pH is equally important, as incorrect levels can lock nutrients out, even if they are present in the solution.\n\nTo simplify the learning curve, new growers can explore guides likehydroponic nutrients for beginners, where step-by-step instructions make it easy to avoid mistakes and build strong foundational skills.\n\nMastering the basics early ensures a smoother, more productive journey into the world of hydroponic gardening.\n\nSuccessful hydroponic gardening doesnt stop at adding nutrients to water; it requires consistent monitoring and adjustments. EC meters and pH testing kits are essential tools for keeping nutrient solutions within the ideal range.\n\nAs plants absorb nutrients and water evaporates, concentrations can fluctuate. Without careful monitoring, plants may face nutrient deficiencies, stunted growth, or salt buildup in the system. Regularly checking solution strength, topping off water levels, and flushing systems, when necessary, ensures a stable environment for roots to thrive.\n\nAutomated nutrient dosing systems are becoming increasingly popular, especially for larger or commercial hydroponic operations. These smart systems help maintain ideal conditions with minimal manual effort.\n\nIncorporating hydroponic nutrient balance strategies into regular garden management improves long-term success and plant vitality.\n\nEven experienced growers can make errors when it comes to nutrients. Overfeeding, underfeeding, or failing to monitor pH can all lead to disappointing harvests. Recognizing the signs of imbalance  such as yellowing leaves, slow growth, or nutrient burn  is critical for quick intervention.\n\nOne useful strategy is implementing a simple feeding chart and adjusting based on plant response rather than blindly following general schedules. Also, regularly cleaning and sterilizing equipment prevents salt buildup and contamination, two often-overlooked nutrient management issues.\n\nHydroponic success isnt about having perfect systems from the start; its about observing plants, learning from each cycle, and refining techniques over time.\n\nTechnology is transforming how growers manage nutrients. Innovations like real-time nutrient monitors, AI-assisted dosing systems, and environmentally friendly nutrient sources are making hydroponic gardening more sustainable and scalable.\n\nAs hydroponic systems become smarter and more automated, the growers role evolves into that of a manager and optimizer. Learning hydroponic nutrient fundamentals today sets gardeners up for long-term success as these technologies become more widespread.\n\nBy understanding and mastering hydroponic nutrients now, growers position themselves at the forefront of a greener, smarter future for agriculture and food production.\n\n",
