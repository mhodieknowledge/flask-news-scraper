            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nIn the heart of Harare West, once dismissed by skeptics as an unlikely canvas for luxury  a bold vision has taken root. The Hills Luxury Golf Estate is rewriting the rules of real estate, sport, and lifestyle in Zimbabwe.\n\nWhat was once called a project of impossibilities is now the countrys most iconic urban development. The lead developer Ken Sharpe, CEO of Westprop Holdings is upbeat with progress so far.\n\nHe feels the project has all the ingredients of luxury, modernity and the future. Last week he hosted an elite gathering of customers to serenade them with progress so far. The customers felt the vibe and committed to the project.\n\nCritics had scoffed at the idea of a baobab forest thriving in Harare West. They doubted that global attention could be drawn to this corner of the capital. Today, those doubts have been silenced by a living, breathing masterpiece  where ancient trees meet modern luxury, and every detail is curated for excellence.\n\nAt the heart of this transformation is a golf course designed by none other than Peter Matkovich, the current world number one golf architect. His signature blends natural beauty with championship precision, creating a course that is both a sanctuary and a stage for greatness.\n\nThe Hills is not just a place to live  itnis a place to belong. Exclusive features include:\n\nBranded Residences: Architecturally stunning homes with direct access to the golf course.\n\nSpeaking at a recent customer familiarization tour of the project Simukai Whande WestProp Digital Marketing Manager had this to say: This is a rare moment in time. Early investors will benefit from pre-launch pricing, securing premium assets at unmatched value. Once the ceremonial first tee is struck, prices will rise by an average of 40%, reflecting the true worth of this landmark estate.\n\nThe Hills is proof that vision, courage, and excellence can defy geography and expectation. Its a celebration of Zimbabwean pride, global standards, and the power of belief. What was once deemed impossible is now inevitable, and those who act early will own a piece of history.\n\n",

            "content": "By Sports Reporter\n\nThe Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) has blocked the Premier Soccer Leagues (PSL) move to suspend relegation for the current season, saying the decision, made just days before the campaign ends, cannot be implemented.\n\nAt an Extraordinary General Meeting held on Tuesday, the PSL resolved to scrap relegation for the 2025 season. Under PSLs proposal, eight teams that were facing relegation this season would survive, while the four regional division champions would be promoted to the topflight, bringing the league to 22 clubs.\n\nThe meetingwas convened after ZIFA had earlier recommended a 20-team league structure.\n\nIn a statement, ZIFA, however, trashed the PSLs resolution,\n\nThe Association wishes to make it unequivocally clear that this proposal cannot be implemented. Promotion and relegation are fundamental components of football competition and are essential to maintaining the integrity, fairness, and sporting merit of the league system.\n\nZIFA confirmed that four clubs will be relegated at the conclusion of the 2025 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League season, which officially ends on 23 November 2025.\n\nThe association also reminded the PSL to follow proper procedure when proposing structural changes in the future.\n\nShould the Premier Soccer League or any other member wish to propose an adjustment to the number of participating teams or propose any other resolution, such a request must be formally submitted to the Association. In accordance with ZIFA statutes, the proposal will then be tabled for consideration at the next ZIFA Congress, reads the statement.\n\n",
