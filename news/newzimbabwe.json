The company anticipates the plant to reach a sustained steady-state of operation, enabling Zulu to target overall plant availability of 22 days per month, as was originally projected as the required availability to meet target production levels.\n\nDuring the next seven days, we expect to be able to take a final decision on how soon, if at all, the purchase of the secondary spodumene float section should proceed, said Premier.\n\nAt the same time, plans are progressing with the two remaining plant issues requiring longer-term solutions, the replacement of the original OEM-supplied sorters that are not fit for purpose and completion of the tantalum recovery circuit. In regard to the tantalum circuit, we have had interest from several parties seeking to purchase tantalum and potentially assisting with the cost of the circuit.\n\nPremier has struggled to keep its spodumene production plant operating optimally since it set it up some two years ago.\n\nAs a result, it missed the target to make the first spodumene shipment to Chinese offtaker, Canmax Technologies (Canmax), by March 2023.\n\nThree months later, it declared force majeure, but Canmax contested the declaration and demanded repayment of the $35mn it provided to Premier to build the processing plant.\n\n",

            "content": "An investigation by the British Army has found some soldiers stationed at a controversial base in Kenya continue to use sex workers despite being banned from doing so.\n\nSoldiers at the British Army Training Unit Kenya (Batuk) used sex workers at a low or moderate level, a report said, adding more work was needed to stamp out the practice.\n\nThe investigation covered a period of more than two years, examining conduct at the base dating back to July 2022.\n\nIt was commissioned in October 2024 following an investigation by ITV into the behaviour of soldiers at Batuk, including allegations some army personnel were paying local women for sex.\n\nThe ITV documentary followed previous concerns raised about Batuk after the death in 2012 of a local woman Agnes Wanjiru, allegedly killed by a British soldier stationed at the base.\n\nSince then a string of allegations have been made about the conduct of troops at the training site, which lies near the town of Nanyuki 200km (125 miles) north of Kenyas capital Nairobi.\n\nIn 2022, the UKs Ministry of Defence banned its forces from using sex workers abroad as part of efforts to curb sexual exploitation and abuse across the military.\n\nUK Chief of General Staff Gen Sir Roly Walker said in a statement that the army was committed to stopping sexual exploitation by those in its ranks.\n\nThe findings of the Service Inquiry I commissioned conclude that transactional sex is still happening in Kenya at a low to moderate level. It should not be happening at all, he said.\n\nThere is absolutely no place for sexual exploitation and abuse by people in the British Army. It is at complete odds with what it means to be a British soldier. It preys on the vulnerable and benefits those who seek to profit from abuse and exploitation, he added.\n\nThe service inquiry investigationwas carried out by a panel of four people, including two serving officers, a civil servant and an independent adviser.\n\nIt investigated the behaviour of troops stationed at Batuk and assessed the armys systems to prevent breaches of its regulation JSP 769 which bans soldiers from paying for sex.\n\nThe report details 35 instances in which Batuk soldiers were suspected to have paid for sex, since guidance for soldiers on the rule was published in July 2022. During that period 7,666 British soldiers served at the base.\n\nIt notes that of those, 26 cases happened before training on the new rule was initiated for all army staff in November of that year, with nine reported cases since then. In the majority of cases, the allegation that soldiers had paid for sex was never proven.\n\nIn addition to those detailed in the report, the Foreign Office told the BBC there was a small number  less than five  cases of alleged use of sex workers currently under investigation. The alleged incidents happened after the inquiry was concluded.\n\nThe report said that despite the training given by the Army and the control measures in place, the reality was that transactional sexual activity by UK personnel in Kenya was still happening, and that the level is somewhere between low and moderate.\n\nIt is not out of control, but the best way for the Army to manage the risk is for the Army to assume it may be at the upper end of that scale between low and moderate, the report added.\n\nThe report noted efforts by the Army to stamp out the practice, including regular training and the use of sharkwatch patrols with a non-commissioned officer of the rank of sergeant or above deployed to monitor the conduct of junior personnel when they left the base for nights out.\n\nThe army said it would implement recommendations from the report, including making it easier to dismiss soldiers found to have used sex workers and the implementation of additional training.\n\nThe report follows years of controversy about the conduct of soldiers at Batuk sparked by an investigation by the Sunday Times in 2021 which revealed the alleged involvement of a British soldier in the murder of Ms Wanjiru, a mother of one whose body was found dumped in a septic tank near a hotel where she had been seen with soldiers on the night she vanished.\n\nSeparately in Kenya, MPs have been conducting an inquiry into wider allegations of mistreatment of local people by soldiers at Batuk and have heard claims at public hearings of injuries allegedly sustained through the behaviour of British troops and of soldiers fathering children to Kenyan mothers and then abandoning them when they returned home.\n\nIn June this year a soldier stationed at the base was sent back to the UK after being accused of rape.\n\nThe Service Inquiry behind the latest report said it had spoken to many local Kenyans and found the vast majority of local residents were happy with the presence of the Batuk camp.\n\n",

            "content": "An increasing number of operators are pivoting to turnkey casino and sportsbook services  with good reason. These solutions take care of legal, financial, and technical challenges related to creating a casino outfit from scratch. Plus, the software is easy to manage and offers impressive flexibility. Turnkey refers to being available for use. And DSTGAMING is a preferred choice for operators. This blog post explores why turnkey casino and sportsbook solutions, especially DSTGAMING, are gaining traction.\n\nSeven Reasons Why More Operators Prefer Turnkey Platforms\n\nHere are seven reasons whyturnkey casinos and sportsbooksare becoming popular:\n\nLower Upfront Costs\n\nDeveloping a sportsbook or casino from scratch requires a significant capital investment. Operators would channel resources toward certified software development, website design, legal fees, testing, security, and other essential components before going live. As expected, the total cost can run up to several hundred thousand dollars. In contrast, turnkey solutions are ready-to-use and cost-effective alternatives.\n\nChoosingDSTGAMINGturnkey packages reduces the financial burden and stress of starting from scratch. Operators get a ready-made platform with total control over functionality and customization. Most of the groundwork required has already been done, which helps reduce ownership costs significantly.\n\nFaster Market Entry: Launches in Weeks\n\nWhile building a custom platform could take a year or more, turnkey solutions can be up and running in a couple of weeks. Timing plays a vital role in developing a casino or sportsbook. A considerable benefit of a turnkey platform is the speed at which an operator can get into the market.\n\nFor example, DSTGAMING assembles all essential systems  payments, tech, permits, game collections, and operational tools- in weeks. This momentum gives operators a competitive edge, allowing quick entry and the possibility of market domination early in their launch period.\n\nHigher Level of Customisation\n\nUnlike white-label solutions, turnkey solutions provide a much higher level of customization. You can kickstart with a basic setup to test the market and progressively add more features based on user feedback and receptiveness. This flexibility is a significant factor in why turnkey solutions appeal to more operators. It also gives your brand an edge in a crowded niche where users are always seeking fresh and innovative experiences. You can easily shape your platform appearance, add new games, make UI/UX changes, and expand bonus offerings.\n\nRobust Compliance and Security Tools\n\nTurnkey solution providers are equipped with the expertise to provide robust compliance and security features and tools. These tools and features include:\n\nBefore being launched into the markets, these solutions are backed by KYC/AML requirements, licensing, and secure payment solutions. In jurisdictions like Latin America and Europe, you need the necessary licensing to avoid regulatory issues. DSTGAMING offers aids to help navigate these regions. This way, operators focus on building their brand without worrying about legal hurdles. Hence, a smoother and better entry into multiple markets.Offers Long-term ScalabilityThe tech space leaves no room for chance; experts are being intentional about providing solutions. These solutions get absorbed by iGaming operators, especially with products like AI, blockchain, and microgames. That being the case, operators must evolve or risk falling behind. One of the reasons turnkey software continues gaining traction is its capacity for possible adaptation. These solutions support frequent updates, offer scalable APIs, and can take on new features. Your brand can stay ahead of the curve without any costly redevelopment.Mobile Optimisation & App IntegrationTurnkey solution software is designed with mobile devices in view. Hence, compatibility with iOS and Android platforms is prioritized  a responsive and polished UI/UX design. Focusing on mobile usability offers an edge in the competitive industry as more gambling platforms are becoming mobile-friendly.After-service SupportCasino and sportsbook platforms like DSTGAMING dont only provide a ready-made iGaming platform and walk away  they continue to support you post-launch. Support includes 24/7 tech assistance, onboarding guidelines, and maintenance. The aim is to carry these burdens so you can focus more on running your business. Also, there are built-in tools that track players behavior so operators can stay ahead of customers.Is Choosing Turnkey Casino and Sportsbook Platforms the Right Choice for You?Yes, in todays fast-paced world, a turnkey solution is a smart move.

That said, when selecting a provider, DSTGAMING should be your top choice. They help you set up with ease, offering exceptional value through the development process.Key TakeawayThe iGaming space is gradually turning towards turnkey solutions for their flexibility, security measures, and compliance.

            "content": "IOL\n\nThe South African government appears unmoved by the recent visa ban imposed by the US embassy in Harare, Zimbabwe, even as US President Donald Trump continues to disrupt global diplomacy with tariff increases and immigration policies seven months into his second term.\n\nThe US has suspended all routine immigrant and non-immigrant visa services to Zimbabwe due to concerns about misuse and overstays. However, the issuance of other visa types remains unaffected.\n\nAlthough South Africa was exempt from new Trump visa restrictions on SADC countries, a new policy has been implemented for Malawi and Zambia.\n\nCitizens of these nations are now required to pay a bond of $5,000 (R88,656) to $15,000 (R265,967) to travel to the United States.\n\nAdditionally, the citizens are required to use one of three airportsBostons Logan International, New Yorks JFK International, or Dulles International near Washington D.C.for both arrival and departure.\n\nWhen asked whether South African citizens should be worried, Department of International Relations and Cooperation (Dirco) spokesperson Chrispin Phiri gave a brief response: We do not provide commentary on other countries visa regimes, and this is our general position, its not specific to the US.\n\nA senior government official, however, downplayed the likelihood of South Africans being affected by the US visa restrictions.\n\nRemember Trump is only in our case because of the International Court of Justice case against Israel and our involvement in BRICS. Nothing more and nothing less, the official said.\n\nSouth Africans visiting the US are mostly professionals who either go for business or a holiday. We seldom have citizens wanting to immigrate to the USwe should have nothing to worry about, he said.\n\nThe US embassy explained that the reasons for the restrictions was because the administration was working to prevent visa overstay and misuse as part of national security.\n\nThe Trump administration is protecting our nation and citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process, the embassy said.\n\nWe are always working to prevent visa overstay and misuse.\n\nIn June, the US imposed travel bans on citizens from 12 countries, with seven of them located in Africa. Additionally, heightened restrictions were applied to seven other nations, three of which are African.\n\nThe US has issued a demand to 36 countries, predominantly in Africa, to enhance their traveler vetting procedures. Failure to comply could result in a ban on their citizens visiting the US.\n\nInternational Relations analyst Rejoice Ngwenya said it was unfortunate that the US had an obsession with immigration issues.\n\nAll democratic countries must encourage international country movements. However it is incumbent upon citizens that they dont abuse regulations. But one thing to acknowledge in terms of implementation of immigration laws globally is not to interfere and dissuade inter country movements of students because knowledge sharing and education is a universal right, Ngwenya said.\n\nInternational Relations expert Dr Noluthando Phungula said Trump continues to shake global diplomacy as he feels threatened, especially by BRICS countries.\n\nAs a head of stateand a representative of the unipolar super power bloc, Trump was threatened especially by BRICS, which South Africa is a part of.\n\nThe BRICS expansion and growth speaks to a clearer call from the Global South towards multilateralism. This inadvertently challenges Western dominance and calls for a reformation of international power structures. This is certainly an uncomfortable reality for Trump.\n\nWhile the formation may not be directly competing with the US, it directly challenges the unipolar global power dynamic, in which the United States is regarded as the lead superpower. The BRICS are a representation of a significant and needed transition towards a multipolar power setting, in which various countries lead global cooperation efforts.\n\n",

Ronaldo, who is the most followed person on Instagram, has not yet made a comment about their engagement.\n\nThe couple have been together for nine years, after they met at a Gucci shop in Madrid where Rodrguez was working.
