While these products may appear cheaper, they come at a significant cost to public health. Many of these items have not been certified as safe for human consumption by our health authorities, he said.\n\nRunyowa disclosed that a recent survey conducted by the ministry, in collaboration with the Standards Association of Zimbabwe, found that half of the products sold in informal retail shops failed to meet required standards.\n\nThis is a fight that requires everyones involvement. The situation is dire, and we need to act decisively to protect consumers.\n\nWe purchased items directly from shelves and sent them for testing. The results were alarming50% of the products were non-compliant. Were talking about fake Vaseline, fake flour, fake rice, and even fake toothpaste. This is a serious public health concern, he explained.\n\nThe ongoing blitz against counterfeit and smuggled goods, which began last year, has already seen significant progress.\n\nSince October, weve ramped up our efforts, resulting in the seizure and destruction of tonnes of illicit goods. Just this afternoon, we destroyed approximately four tonnes of counterfeit products.\n\nWe are committed to intensifying our efforts, but we need your backing to win this battle, he said.\n\nThe surge in informal trading has had a detrimental effect on formal retail businesses, with many large supermarket chains reporting significant losses as more consumers turn to tuck shops for cheaper alternatives, some formal retailers have been forced to scale back operations or shut down entirely.\n\nHigh-density areas such as Mbare have been identified as the hotbeds of counterfeit goods that are flooding the markets.\n\nRunyowa further said that there is a need for a balanced approach to address the issue.\n\nWhile we must crack down on counterfeit goods, we also need to find ways to support formal businesses and ensure they remain competitive, he said.\n\nThe ministrys findings underscore the urgent need for stricter regulations and public awareness campaigns to combat the spread of counterfeit products and safeguard public health.\n\n",

Its not about money, I just refused to be weighed down and wasting my time. First thing tomorrow morning is replacing the screen; as long as these people havent eaten my money, its a win for me.\n\nHowever, in a statement, the City of Harare said the man who damaged her windscreen is not an employee adding that they were keen to interview the owner of the car as breaking a clamp affixed on a car is an offence.\n\nWe have taken note of the video of a blue motor vehicle Registration number AGG7256 which had been clamped by our parking marshals in the Central Business District.\n\nThe vehicle is seen being driven back and forth and in the process breaking the clamp. The video further shows a man in civilian attire throwing a piece of the broken clamp on the windscreen of the speeding car. The City wishes to put the following on record:\n\nThe man who is seen throwing the metal object at the car is not a member or an employee of the City of Harare.\n\nThe breaking of a clamp affixed on a motor vehicle by an authorised officer is an offence.\n\nConsequently Harare Traffic Enforcement Unit is keen to interview the owner of the motor vehicle registration number AGG 7256 in connection with the breaking of a clamp, the notice reads.\n\nMembers of the public are encouraged to comply with the Harare (Clamping and Tow) bylaw 2005 which states that the release of clamped vehicles is upon payment of prescribed fines.\n\nMalloti made headlines earlier this year following revelations that she has been on the South African Police Services (SAPS) wanted list since 2017.\n\nAccording to SAPS records, a warrant of arrest for one Namatai Bhobhowho is facing charges of armed robberywas issued on January 19, 2018, at the Wynberg Magistrate Court in South Africa.\n\n",

            "content": "By Delaney Phiri I University of London\n\nThe recent move by Zimbabwe police to take Mr Blessed Mhlanga, a well-known journalist, into custody without following due process is and ought to be understood for what it is. That move, at the very least, can be said to be an unlawful arrest and, at the very worst, it is and should be understood as a State-facilitated abduction!\n\nBy definition, abduction is the act of taking someone away by force or deception; which is precisely the case here. The said Mr Mhlanga was taken by force, under the guise of bogus charges which do not hold even an ounce water (deception). In circumstances where a journalist conducts an interview with a person of interest, the journalist cannot be held responsible for the views of the interviewee.\n\nSecondly, and more interestingly, the said Mr Mhlanga is not an independent journalist; he is not the owner of the said media house. He is merely an agent of the company, who was acting in the course of his employment. As such, it does not follow that he can personally be liable for the alleged wrongful conduct on behalf of the media house he is employed by. The principle of vicarious liability immediately kicks in under these circumstances.\n\nBlessed Mhlanga at the Harare courts on Tuesday\n\nIn furtherance of the above, there are directors, persons who signed off on the production and broadcasting of the said interview and, against that back drop, a question has to be asked  are they also being prosecuted? If the answer to that question is not in the affirmative then, surely, the charges cannot be said to be genuine and or a bona fide investigation leading to a just outcome; they are simply bogus.\n\nAnother point or consideration; an arrest on the basis that the interviewee shared some opinions which may have been a breach of certain acts in the criminal codification brings to surface the fact that the rule of law isnt necessarily adhered to in the said jurisdiction. It is a well-known and established principle of law that everyone is entitled to the presumption of innocence. And, if we are to be true to this principle, it does not follow that a journalist can be arrested on suspicion that the interviewee shared opinions that may be argued to have been incitement of violence and or undermining the office of the President.\n\nThe States averement would be that the journalist amplified remarks by the interviewee and, in so doing, can be said to have aided and abetted the accused. However, before the interviewer is even considered for liability, there needs to be a determination on the question of whether or not the remarks made by his guest were in, and of themselves, criminal in nature.\n\nA decision has to be made by a competent court of law. In circumstances where that determination has NOT been made, any proceedings against the journalist are, at the very least, premature and lack any basis at law and hence the assertion that this is a State-facilitated abduction!\n\nThe fact that an abduction has been made by State agents using State resources and hiding behind the law does not, in fact, change what this is; it is still an abduction. It remains an abduction and should be addressed and understood as such. To call this an arrest sanitises and legitimises the said abduction. There is no basis at law for this so-called arrest. Journalism is not a crime, an unlawful arrest as a means to intimidate the journalist is accurately called an abduction.\n\nIn opposing bail, or in refusing to do the right thing, the State incompetently argued that Mr Mhlanga could not be released on bail on the basis that, inter alia, the equipment used has not been ceased. Therefore, the likelihood of him committing similar offences is high. What the State immured in its arguments is the fact that, the said equipment does not belong to the journalist but is the property of the company he works for.\n\nThis argument exposes the fact that, the aim of opposing bail is not a bona fide objection in the interest of justice but rather selective persecution of the journalist. Firstly, if the equipment is out there and the concern is he may have access to it, why not order the company to restrict him from access to the said equipment?\n\nSecondly, the argument that he may interfere with potential witnesses who are his junior colleagues further proves he acted in the course of his employment and the absence of any claims by his employer that he acted outside the ambit of his employment further solidifies the fact that he acted in the course of his employment and if there is any case to answer then the company is answerable.\n\nThis misplaced and overzealous persecution of a journalist is one example of malicious prosecution to instil fear into all journalists. Release Blessed Mhlanga! We condemn State-facilitated abductions!!\n\nSound of Justice!! Delaney Phiri lecturer at the University of London.\n\n",
