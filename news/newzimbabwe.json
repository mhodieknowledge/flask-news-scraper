            "content": "By James Muonwa\n\nCARBON Green Investments (CGI) has expressed commitment to implement its suspended Kariba REDD+ Project on forests conservation and community support in Zimbabwe.\n\nThis position follows endorsement by Verra, which is the global carbon credits regulatory body, acknowledging that the status of retired Kariba REDD+ credits will not change, and remain valid in their registry, meaning previously purchased credits also stay valid notwithstanding the baseline reassessment.\n\nThe carbon project owner says it welcomes Verras report, which it will scrutinise together with officials from the Government of Zimbabwe.\n\nCGI thanks Verra for providing its update and results from their review of the Kariba REDD+ Project, as outlined in their September 23, 2025, letter and public statement, said GCI in a statement.\n\nIn response, CGI, in collaboration with the Government of Zimbabwe, will carefully review Verras outcome. To ensure a thorough, true, and accurate outcome, CGI has concluded independent third-party assessments of the carbon accounting and related matters, using all up-to-date data, scientific findings and appropriate methodologies. From this evaluation, CGI will partner with the new registry to address and mitigate any historical discrepancies in credit issuance, prioritising transparency and the long-term sustainability of the project.\n\nWe value Verras role in trying to advance environmental integrity and looks forward to constructive dialogue as we move forward.\n\nCGI remains committed to the Kariba REDD+ Projects mission of forest conservation and community support in Zimbabwe. We are grateful for Verras input and are committed to continue working towards resolutions that uphold the highest standards, the company said.\n\nAmidst the positive outlook, GCI issued a weeks ultimatum demanding from Verra the baseline assessment report and data sources for the Kariba REDD+ Project review.\n\nWhile we appreciate the update on the carbon accounting and quality control processes, we are concerned by the lack of accompanying detail regards the basis for the reported findings, wrote CGI in a note dated September 25, 2025.\n\nAs the project proponent, we are committed to engaging constructively and transparently with all stakeholders involved, the company further said, before demanding the baseline reassessment report and data sources.\n\nFurther, GCI requested a freeze on the compensation process and interfering with its clients without the companys prior consent.\n\nThe ultimatum comes in the wake of concerns by Verra that there was over-crediting of carbons for the Kariba REDD+ Project, which some environmental analysts have questioned.\n\nIn an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Phillip Mutemachani said Verra was shooting itself in the foot by stating alleged over-crediting Kariba REDD+ Project carbon credits.\n\nMeanwhile, carbon asset developer, South Pole, has also added its voice on the saga of Verras Section 6 review into the Kariba REDD+ Project.\n\nAlthough South Pole has ceased all involvement with both project and the project owner since 2023, we have cooperated with Verra, a global carbon standard body, through every step of this review, which we see as an important process to give everyone, including South Pole and its various stakeholders, more clarity and guidance on the projects status and future.\n\nThe integrity and robustness of the buffer pool mechanism remain intact to manage any potential emissions reversals in the project.\n\nIn its past role as carbon asset developer, South Pole has consistently applied Verras VM0009 methodology as it pertains to carbon accounting, South Pole noted in a statement.\n\nIn normal circumstances under Verras VM009 methodology, any discrepancy between projected and actual deforestation (i.e. after a periodic assessment of the baseline as outlined in the methodology itself), would be corrected in subsequent verification periods.\n\nHowever, given the unprecedented situation of the project withdrawing from the Verra Registry, there are no subsequent monitoring periods where such compensation could occur. Verras update confirms that the carbon standard body is now taking proactive, corrective steps to balance credit issuances in lieu of the correction that would have otherwise been applicable as per the in-built true-up mechanism in VM0009.\n\nAlongside South Poles wider cooperation as part of the review, South Pole has proactively requested that Verra cancel the 2.5 million verified Kariba REDD+ credits South Pole holds to help address the discrepancies in issued credits and uphold the environmental integrity of the project.\n\nThis contribution builds on South Poles concerted efforts over the last two years to undergo a comprehensive transformation, which included a full review and strengthening of the companys quality, risk, and compliance protocols. The company introduced stricter KYC and partner diligence processes to ensure project partners align with our ethical and compliance standards.\n\nAs a carbon asset developer hired by the project owner, South Poles past responsibility was to ensure that Verras VM0009 methodology was being consistently applied as it pertains to the carbon accounting of the project, in order to receive verified carbon credits.\n\nIn addition, it managed the sale of carbon credits to the market in order to secure funding for the projects operations on the ground, but responsibility for operating the project on the ground  including engagement with and distribution of funds to local communities and initiatives  has been with CGIs local partner Carbon Green Africa (CGA).\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans living in the diaspora. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back, Mr Madzima. We understand that you are a speaker at the UK-Zimbabwe Business Expo, scheduled for October 24, 2025,in Birmingham. We want to pick your brain on multi-jurisdictional trade and investment by thediaspora, although we understand that you are going to speak in more detail at the conference. In your view, does the citizenship affect how their investment is treated or play any role?.\n\nVM: Thank you\n\nIt is common knowledge that a significant number of our diaspora community have taken up different citizenship or nationalities. It is also commonly accepted that the taking up of such citizenship was mainly on economic grounds and for ease of movement. Our recent history, coupled with sanctions imposed on the country, has limited economic growth and made it extremely difficult for Zimbabweans to travel and fully express their economic potential in Zimbabwe and across the world.\n\nThat being said, our constitution permits citizens by birth to hold dual citizenship. Dual citizenship has the same benefit as if the holder is a local with Zimbabwean citizenship only. Citizens by registration are generally restricted from holding dual citizenship.\n\nWe also have as part of the diaspora community, citizens who acquired citizenship of other countries before the current constitution of 2013. These members of the diaspora community could not hold dual citizen and had to renounce their Zimbabwean citizenship, in most instances, unwillingly.\n\nThis community may, if they so wish, make applications for restoration of citizenship in terms of the new Act.\n\nIt is worth pointing out, however, that in terms of our ZIDA Act, foreign investors must be accorded the same treatment as domestic investors and must not be treated less favourably. Provisions in our law that favoured local citizens,for example as contained in the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act, have been suspended and superseded by the ZIDA Act\n\nReporter:What will the diaspora investor need to qualify for protection under the ZIDA Act and what protections does it offer?\n\nVM: The Diaspora investor will be required to register the investment with the Zimbabwe Investment Development Agency. Registration may be made by a foreign or citizen investor.\n\nThe aim is to ensure that the investment benefits from statutory protections.\n\nTo the foreign investor, such registration affords the investment protection from nationalisation or expropriation. This is key for the foreign investor, as our country suffered bad publicity in this area. Should there be any expropriation for a public purpose, the investor is assured of quick and adequate compensation.\n\nI however, think that for the diaspora investor, the key protection has to do with the ability to repatriate capital and profits. This area has been a thorn in the past.\n\nWhat is required is that the investment is registered, capital flows through official channels like banks and the profits, dividends and capital may be inversely repatriated through authorised channels like the banks after payment of local taxes.\n\nReporter: Having opted to invest in the country, what are the best vehicles for the diaspora to house their investment in?\n\nVM: To a legal mind like myself, the words limited liability have a certain appeal to them. With that in mind, am inclined to recommend that the opening of a private limited company or a private business corporation, as they shield the acts of the company from the other personal wealth of the investor.\n\nOnly in extreme cases do our courts pierce the corporate veil to make the members of a company liable for the acts of the company.\n\nShould the investor already be operating another similar business in a different jurisdiction, they may consider opening and registering a branch in Zimbabwe, with the head office being located in a different jurisdiction.\n\nReporter: Because of our time, may you kindly explain what happens if a diaspora dies with different properties in different jurisdictions?\n\nVM: Well, this really depends on whether or not the diaspora had a will. In terms of our laws, all immovable property is governed by the laws where the property is situate, and all movable property is governed by the law where the deceased was domiciled at the time of death. An estate registered in another country with letters of administration of that country may be recognised and registered in Zimbabwe, subject to compliance issues.\n\nIt is worth noting that wills have to be compliant with Zimbabwe law formalities, and property that is not governed by a will may be subject to our intestate laws.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have to end here, because of our time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nhttps://www.tickettailor.com/events/zido/1546892\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

Botswana and Eswatini have also shown interest in adopting similar legislation, and it is hoped this process will be accelerated.Langa further noted that the African Commission on Human and Peoples Rights (ACHPR) emphasises that access to information holds the promise of fostering good governance by improving information management, and by enhancing transparency, accountability and greater participation of the populace in public affairs.He added that ACHPR further observes that the lack of access to information deprives citizens of their right to participate in the decision-making process and hold elected representatives accountable for their acts or omissions and creates an environment in which corruption, maladministration and mismanagement of national resources may thrive.The MISA chairperson appealed to responsible authorities in the region to heed the call to make necessary legislative progress.Therefore, we urge countries that have yet to enact such legislation to expedite this process to improve citizen participation in governance, Langa said.This years theme isEnsuring Access to Environmental Information in the Digital Age, which Langa said is especially crucial for Southern Africa, a region highly vulnerable to climate shocks.The region is recovering from its worst drought in a generation, and cyclone-induced flooding has become prevalent.Increased demand for commodities has led to intensified mining activities, sometimes resulting in environmental disasters, as recent reports have highlighted widespread water and soil contamination linked to a February mine spill in Zambia.These examples emphasise the vital importance of timely and accessible information in the region, allowing citizens to make well-informed decisions.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has dismissed with costs a US$108,766 damages claim filed by 83-year-old farmer Cleopas Matenga against motorist Amanda Zietsman, ruling that the plaintiff failed to prove negligence and that his own testimony undermined his case.\n\nJustice Joel Mambara granted Zietsmans application for absolution from the instance at the close of Matengas case, saying the plaintiff pleaded one thing and proved another, leaving the court with no coherent cause of action.The plaintiffs evidence is so defective and self-defeating that it has not established a prima facie case of negligence against the defendant, Justice Mambara said in his judgment delivered on September 8, 2025.By his own admissions and his witnesses concessions, his claim became untenable.The claim stemmed from a road traffic accident on September 10, 2023, along the HarareChirundu highway near the Magunje turn-off. Matenga, then 82, attempted to cross the highway to meet his brother at a bus stop when he was struck by Zietsmans vehicle.He later issued summons in September 2024 seeking over US$43,000 in medical expenses, US$5,000 in future treatment costs, and US$55,000 in general damages for loss of earnings and amenities. Matenga argued that the accident was caused solely by Zietsmans negligence.Zietsman denied liability, insisting she had exercised reasonable care by keeping a lookout, hooting, and braking when Matenga suddenly dashed onto the road.During trial, Matenga admitted he neither saw the approaching car nor heard the horn. He also conceded that all his medical expenses were paid by his brother, and he produced no proof of earnings to support his damages claim.The police officer, who attended the scene, confirmed visibility was good and acknowledged the plaintiff had created a sudden emergency for the driver.The plaintiffs conceded he contributed to the accident, although he sought to apportion greater blame to the driver.Mambara noted this left the plaintiffs case self-destructive.The plaintiff pleaded exclusive fault by the defendant but proved contributory negligence on his own part. The law does not permit the court to make a finding of contributory negligence out of the blue when it was never pleaded, the judge said.He added that the damages claim also failed.The plaintiff failed to provide the conclusive evidence necessary to sustain a claim for damages. A court cannot embark upon conjecture where there is no factual basis.The High Court found that Zietsman had acted as a reasonable driver under the circumstances and that no evidence of speeding, lack of lookout, or negligence was established.Matengas entire claim was dismissed, and he was ordered to pay costs.Justice is served by terminating the case at this juncture, Mambara ruled.\n\nJustice Joel Mambara granted Zietsmans application for absolution from the instance at the close of Matengas case, saying the plaintiff pleaded one thing and proved another, leaving the court with no coherent cause of action.\n\nThe plaintiffs evidence is so defective and self-defeating that it has not established a prima facie case of negligence against the defendant, Justice Mambara said in his judgment delivered on September 8, 2025.By his own admissions and his witnesses concessions, his claim became untenable.The claim stemmed from a road traffic accident on September 10, 2023, along the HarareChirundu highway near the Magunje turn-off.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has ruled that Simbisa Brands Zimbabwe, the operator of Chicken Inn, Pizza Inn and other fast-food outlets, infringed music copyrights by playing songs without a valid licence from the Zimbabwe Music Rights Association (ZIMURA), but escaped paying nearly US$87,000 in claimed damages after the court found the figure ill-conceived.\n\nJustice Jacob Mafusire delivered the ruling on September 10, 2025, in a case that pitched two rival collecting societies  ZIMURA and the Zimbabwe Council of Copyright Owners (Zimcoco)  against one another, while testing the scope of Zimbabwes Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act.The first defendant violated the copyright in the musical works played at its outlets, Justice Mafusire ruled.Such copyright had been assigned to the plaintiff. It was the plaintiff which had the exclusive right to do what the owner of a copyright is permitted to do in terms of the Act.ZIMURA sued Simbisa Brands for royalties covering November 2023 to October 2024, accusing it of using music by its members  including almost all of Zimbabwes best-known musicians such as Alick Macheso, Jah Prayzah, Nutty O, Winky D, and the late Oliver Mtukudzi  without paying fees. ZIMURA argued that even foreign artists under the CISAC global agreement were affected.The association demanded US$86,719, equivalent to its annual licence fees for Simbisa outlets, and sought a declaration that Zimcoco had no authority to licence songs from ZIMURAs stable.Simbisa countered that it had already paid royalties to Zimcoco, a rival collecting society registered in 2019, and had been assured by the Ministry of Justices Copyright Office that this was sufficient.Zimcoco, for its part, argued it was equally entitled to licence music users, and had lawfully licensed Simbisa.Justice Mafusire dismissed Zimcocos stance, saying registration as a collecting society does not give blanket authority.The issue is not about being registered as a collecting society. It is about who has the copyright in the music played for public consumption, the judge wrote.The second defendant cannot possibly authorise any person to play music that is protected by copyright.However, the court rejected ZIMURAs damages claim, finding that it had simply equated lost royalties to the value of its annual licence without proving actual prejudice suffered by its members.The plaintiffs computation of the amount of its claim and the quantum thereto are ill-conceived, Justice Mafusire said.Works of music by different artists cannot possibly have the same value The quantum bears no relationship to the prejudice allegedly suffered.The court ruled that Zimcoco (the second defendant) cannot authorise anyone to play music protected by copyright.Mafusire also said Simbisa Brands was absolved from the damages claim and also that Zimcoco must pay ZIMURAs costs, while Simbisa and ZIMURA will each bear their own costs.\n\nJustice Jacob Mafusire delivered the ruling on September 10, 2025, in a case that pitched two rival collecting societies  ZIMURA and the Zimbabwe Council of Copyright Owners (Zimcoco)  against one another, while testing the scope of Zimbabwes Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act.\n\nThe first defendant violated the copyright in the musical works played at its outlets, Justice Mafusire ruled.Such copyright had been assigned to the plaintiff.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nOUTSPOKEN former independent Norton legislator, Temba Mliswa has challenged erstwhile anti-corruption crusader Vice President (Retired) General Constantino Chiwenga to deal with the rogue behaviour of some Chinese nationals.\n\nMliswa, who recently waxed lyrical in support of President Emmerson Mnangagwa whose bid to extend his term to 2030 has widened the cracks within the Zanu PF party, made the surprise call to Chiwenga seemingly endorsing his leadership style.Chiwenga, who has been on a crusade against corruption, at times describing it as a national security threat, recently tabled a dossier at the Zanu PF Politburo meeting in which Mnangagwa loyalists like Kudakwashe Tagwirei and Wicknell Chivhayo were mentioned.Temba MliswaMliswa believes Chiwenga is using corruption as an trump card, aiming to succeed his principal in 2028, hence his somewhat sarcastic plea for the latter to deal with the Chinese if he is serious about tackling graft.In particular, a Chinese investor, Shuntai Investments Private Limited, is in a spot of bother with a private school, Bryden Country School in Chegutu, over construction of a cement plant near the elite learning institution. The school has raised health fears given the factorys proximity to it. There are suspicions the investor is bribing authorities to evade sanctions.Despite a High Court order halting the work, the Shuntai Investments is still going on with works, thereby giving credence to rumours that money could be exchanging hands or the investor has protection from political bigwigs.Mnangagwas spokesman, George Charamba, recently said there is nothing untoward with the Chinese building a firm close to the school.Mliswa, who is a former Zanu PF Mashonaland West Chairman, hopes Chiwenga intervenes in the standoff between Bryden Country School and the Chinese investor to display his genuineness to fight against corruption and is not just targeting Mnangagwas close allies.Hon VP can you assist on this problem with Bryden. I also have a child there. The Chinese cant be preferred over us & our good education. As a leading light against corruption can you kindly deal with this Chinese issue which has been ignored as they are protected from high up, Mliswa posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday.Mliswa further highlighted the less-than-ideal behaviour of the Chinese in Hurungwe, where they are ignoring a court order and continuing operations in the area, with locals on the verge of being displaced.I also have a Chinese problem in Rengwe with our 25-year lease under threat as a cartel in Gvt (government) wants to displace us & bring some Chinese. They are doing this despite a court order blocking that. I would appreciate your intervention very much. Fighting corruption starts now.Rengwe Conservancy is a wildlife conservation and tourism area in Zimbabwe located across the Hurungwe, Gokwe North, and Nyaminyami districts.Mliswa has stated that whilst he supports Chiwengas fight against corruption, the former army boss should not use the issue to score political points against rivals.I fully support VP Chiwengas rallying call but the fight against corruption should not be weaponised as a political gadget against rivals. That wont produce results with national benefits but rather advance the agenda of a few, he posted on X recently.Of late, Mliswa has drawn himself into the ruling party succession battle and is not hiding his support for Mnangagwa.\n\nMliswa, who recently waxed lyrical in support of President Emmerson Mnangagwa whose bid to extend his term to 2030 has widened the cracks within the Zanu PF party, made the surprise call to Chiwenga seemingly endorsing his leadership style.\n\nChiwenga, who has been on a crusade against corruption, at times describing it as a national security threat, recently tabled a dossier at the Zanu PF Politburo meeting in which Mnangagwa loyalists like Kudakwashe Tagwirei and Wicknell Chivhayo were mentioned.Temba MliswaMliswa believes Chiwenga is using corruption as an trump card, aiming to succeed his principal in 2028, hence his somewhat sarcastic plea for the latter to deal with the Chinese if he is serious about tackling graft.In particular, a Chinese investor, Shuntai Investments Private Limited, is in a spot of bother with a private school, Bryden Country School in Chegutu, over construction of a cement plant near the elite learning institution.

There are suspicions the investor is bribing authorities to evade sanctions.Despite a High Court order halting the work, the Shuntai Investments is still going on with works, thereby giving credence to rumours that money could be exchanging hands or the investor has protection from political bigwigs.Mnangagwas spokesman, George Charamba, recently said there is nothing untoward with the Chinese building a firm close to the school.Mliswa, who is a former Zanu PF Mashonaland West Chairman, hopes Chiwenga intervenes in the standoff between Bryden Country School and the Chinese investor to display his genuineness to fight against corruption and is not just targeting Mnangagwas close allies.Hon VP can you assist on this problem with Bryden. I also have a child there. The Chinese cant be preferred over us & our good education. As a leading light against corruption can you kindly deal with this Chinese issue which has been ignored as they are protected from high up, Mliswa posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday.Mliswa further highlighted the less-than-ideal behaviour of the Chinese in Hurungwe, where they are ignoring a court order and continuing operations in the area, with locals on the verge of being displaced.I also have a Chinese problem in Rengwe with our 25-year lease under threat as a cartel in Gvt (government) wants to displace us & bring some Chinese. They are doing this despite a court order blocking that. I would appreciate your intervention very much.
