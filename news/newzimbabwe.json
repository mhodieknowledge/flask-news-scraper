Zambia, Ethiopia and Ghana have used the template, which has been criticized for being too slow.\n\nThe framework is being explored, according to the head of Zimbabwes Public Debt Management Office Andrew Bvumbe. We want to maximize the debt relief to the country, he said Wednesday by text message.\n\nIt has appealed to 10 nations to assist in raising$2.6 billionin bridge finance but is yet to receive any concrete commitments.\n\nSouth Africa has not been approached to consider providing bridge finance to Zimbabwe, the National Treasury said.\n\nAfricas largest economy is owed $24 million by its neighbor, according to data provided by the Zimbabwean Treasury.\n\n",

We are forced to improvise daily just to preserve life. But we cannot continue like this. The system has failed, and the suffering is unbearable.\n\nWe call on the government of Zimbabwe to urgently prioritise the health sector. Equip hospitals. Support nurses. Save lives. This situation must be addressed without delay, nurses said.\n\n",

Procedures have been abused to frustrate execution. Entities linked to the applicant have been used to frustrate genuine execution of court orders.\n\nThese include the PHD Ministries and The Walter Magaya Family Trust, saidGetBucks in the application.\n\nIt also said Magaya and his wife are popular figures in the society with Magaya being a prophet at PHD Ministries.\n\nThe two have presented themselves as individuals with nothing and have used entities as agents. They should show the court how they are settling personal obligations and sustaining themselves, reads the application.\n\nA prima facie case has been made entitling the applicant to be granted a provisional order pending confirmation for the liquidation process to promptly commence.\n\nGetBucks also prayed for costs on a higher scale.\n\nThis is classic abuse of proceedings to frustrate court orders and the creditor. Applicant has been put out of pocket unnecessarily by the 1st Respondent and have been forced to resort to this application. Costs on a punitive scale are warranted in cases of abuse of processes, reads the application.\n\nThe matter was set down for a virtual hearing, Wednesday.\n\n",
