Hes got a chance to invite me to the table of dialogue.\n\nEPA Daniel Chapo has promised to heal divisions created by the election\n\nIn his interview with the BBC, Chapo said he wanted to govern in an inclusive way, and to introduce reforms to address concerns about the electoral law, human rights and freedom of expression.\n\nHe said talks were currently taking place with opposition parties represented in the new parliament, and they would later be widened to include all segments of society.\n\nChapo added that he wanted to form a government that was open to all Mozambicans, but he wanted to stress that the profile of the people is very important.\n\nAsked whether he believed Mondlane qualified to serve in government, Chapo replied: It will depend because there is a team that is right now considering that, on the profile of the people, their competencies, their meritocracy, the patriotism  all these pre-requisites that Im alluding to.\n\nIf the team reaches the conclusion that these people have the right profile, they will be part of the government. Those who do not have that profile will not take part.\n\nAged 47, Chapo was chosen by Frelimo, which has been in power since independence 49 years ago, as its candidate to rally young voters affected by high unemployment, and fed up with the partys decades-long rule.\n\nHe told the BBC that he wanted both local and foreign investment to increase in Mozambique in order to make the economy more dynamic.\n\nThis would help create jobs for young people so that they could build their homes, establish their families and stabilize their lives.\n\nMondlane, 50, was seen to have considerable support among young people after he rallied them during the election campaign with the slogan Save Mozambique  this country is ours.\n\nHe contested the poll as an independent after breaking away from the main opposition Renamo party.\n\nA small party that backed his candidacy won a few parliamentary seats in the election.\n\n",

Yesterday after inauguration, Donald Trump made nearly 100 such decisions for the American people that resonated with many on the globe while offending some but putting America first, far-reaching decisions on gender ( recognizing male and female only; A complete Reset to Genesis), exiting Paris Climate Agreement ( a wasteful annual travel expedition for most governments with huge delegates appetite), exiting WHO ( whose disastrous COVID lock downs created more tender barons and impoverished billions) etc.\n\nI am still consumed with analysing the rest of the decisions but they are all cutting wasteful and unnecessary expenditures for the American public while bringing the factories and jobs home!\n\nZanu PF is pushing for the extension of Mnangagwas term in office and to delay the 2028 elections by two years, a move which Mzembi described as completely unproductive.\n\nIn Zimbabwe regrettably we are consumed with one decision called 2030, a completely unproductive, divisive and selfish decision on self-perpetuity and entitlement, and it shall be so for the next two years waking up to this energy-sapping medieval decision that will put us into an election mode hardly two years after emerging from one and three years to the next.\n\nWhen are we going to be making historical decisions like being the first country to mount our flag on Mars? What a mess ! Mzembi wrote on his X account.\n\nZimbabwe has been grappling with high inflation, unemployment, and persistent power shortages and critics have been saying that the government mostly focuses on perpetual electioneering at the expense of governance and development.\n\n",

ZNCC said It seemed that inflationary pressures had been contained as reflected in the month-on-month ZWG and US$ inflation rates.\n\nWhilst inflation statistics from ZimStat show that the US$ inflation rate for October 2024 was 0,7%, the ZiG inflation rate significantly increased. The ZWG month-on-month inflation rate was 37,2% in October 20124, gaining 31.4 points on the September 2024 rate of 5,8%.\n\nThis means that prices as measured by the all items ZWG CPI, increased by an average of 37,2% between September and October 2024, ZNCC added.\n\n",

They must never be insulted by the presiding persons, said Malaba.\n\nAccording to the State-run daily, The Herald, National Council of Chiefs president Mtshane Khumalo blamed the failure to have these training sessions as the reason behind some chiefs behaviour.\n\nNumerous other traditional leaders have been caught offside.\n\nAdded the ZLHR after the release of the video last year: Chief Nyamaropas conduct betrays a contemptuous and demeaning attitude towards women and purveys and perpetuates such attitude considering his position of influence and the fact that the incident is on tape and has been widely disseminated across various social media platforms.\n\n",

So I was reimbursed, said Marara.\n\nMararas controversial compensation comesat a time when the City of Harare is struggling to provide basic services to residents, citing a severe lack of funds.\n\nThis also adds to the ongoing financial controversy surrounding Marara, who previously told the retired Justice Maphios Cheda led the Commission of Inquiry that he earns US$12,000.\n\nThis salary is for a position specifically created for him within the City Council under questionable circumstances.\n\nMarara told the Commission that other employees before him benefited from the inflated compensation compensation package, and a precedent had been set.\n\nThere are a number of employees in the City of Harare who have similar deeds. It did not start with me. I put in my grievances and if the employer then chooses how to handle my grievance I did not see any problem with it.\n\nI could have benefited or not benefited. It was a negotiation. It was not given that I was going to benefit. They could have refused to give me everything. Before I came to do this deed of settlement there were other employees, one example is Dr Chimombe, and Tendai Kwenda. They had committees set of a similar nature.\n\nThey are the ones who even gave benchmarks with regards to even the prices for gadgets. We just took them from what was set as the precedence in other negotiating platforms that were done, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZANU PF has trashed Americas multibillion-dollar assistance to Zimbabwe and declared China as the countrys foremost development partner, in a lengthy statement by its Director of Information Farai Marapira.\n\nMarapira was responding to comments made by US Ambassador to Zimbabwe Pamela Tremont in an interview recently wherein she said Chinese investment in the country was not benefiting the citizens and the number of people living below the poverty line has doubled since 2011.\n\nHer comments can easily be interpreted as having riled Marapira.\n\nTremont highlighted that America was Zimbabwes largest bilateral donor since its independence in 1980 despite the hostility that has characterised the twos relationship since the turn of this millennium.\n\nAmerica had by 2021 provided over US$3.5 billion to Zimbabwe in aid and various other initiatives in its education, health, agriculture and other sectors.\n\nRELATED:Focus on what we could do together, not the negatives  US tells Zimbabwe\n\nPosting on X, Marapira had no kind words for Tremont and America which he described as neo-colonial and praising Chinese influence on Zimbabwe.\n\nWith Zimbabwes independence in 1980, China has consistently been one of our foremost development partners, said Marapira.\n\nChina has also provided donations, such as the National Sports Stadium in Harare, which stands as a symbol of the enduring relationship. These contributions are tangible compared to the actions and donations of the United States, which have primarily been focused on funding fake abductions, sponsoring regime change and all manner of false flag operations against Zimbabwe.\n\nChina has played a key role in modernising Zimbabwes agriculture and mining sectors by introducing affordable farming and mining equipment. Compared to American-made products, which are often expensive and inaccessible to many local farmers and miners, Chinese equipment has been cost-effective and tailored to meet the needs of small and medium-scale operators.\n\nWhen a nation has a narcissistic personality disorder it and other like-minded nations believe no country can develop without their say-so. Unfortunately for them, the horse has bolted, and Zimbabwe like the proverbial phoenix, has risen, and with it new and old partnerships which we will defend and cherish. Neocolonialism died with the decline of the unipolar world.\n\nMore than US$2 billion channelled into Zimbabwes health sector through the Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief has been credited for a reduction in HIV incidences. The US programme sources antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) and family planning resources for the countrys heavily battered health system.\n\n",
