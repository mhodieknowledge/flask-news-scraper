We have the strategy, we have the evidence, and we have the dedicated workforce. What we need now is the collective will to convert our commitments into concrete action. We must find the missing cases, secure the necessary resources and embrace the innovations that will allow us to end TB in Zimbabwe, Mugurungi said.\n\nSpeaking at the same event, Zimbabwean Health and Child Care Minister Douglas Mombeshora commended Zimbabwe for progress in the fight against the infectious disease.\n\nOur TB response has made real progress. But as we celebrate progress, we must also be honest about the road ahead. TB remains a serious public health challenge and the shifting landscape of global health financing is creating uncertainty for critical programs, he added.\n\n",

He did not say when the restrictions will be lifted.\n\nDar es Salaam Regional Commissioner Alfred Chalamila had earlier warned that the government would take strong action against those disrupting peace in the city.\n\nDemonstrations were also reported in the south-western city of Mbeya and the border town of Tunduma.\n\nWe are tired We want an independent electoral commission so that every Tanzanian can choose the leader they want, a protester told the BBC.\n\nAlong with the unrest of the streets, internet connectivity across the country has been severely disrupted. Global internet monitor NetBlocks described the interruption a nationwide digital blackout.\n\nReports say that voter turnout in Dar es Salaam was low when polls opened on Wednesday, with many hesitant to show up amid safety concerns.\n\nA police spokesperson had assured the public there was no threat to their safety, saying people should come out and vote, according to a message posted on social media.\n\nMore than 37 million registered voters are eligible to cast their ballots in the presidential and parliamentary election.\n\nSixteen fringe parties, none of whom have historically had significant public support, have been cleared to contest against President Samia, who is seeking a second term.\n\nThe only other serious contender, Luhaga Mpina of the ACT-Wazalendo party, was disqualified on legal technicalities.\n\nSamias ruling party, CCM, has dominated the countrys politics and has never lost an election since independence.\n\nAhead of the election, rights groups condemned government repression, with Amnesty International citing a wave of terror involving enforced disappearances, torture, and extrajudicial killings of opposition figures.\n\nThe government rejected the claims, and officials said the election would be free and fair.\n\nSamia came into office in 2021 as Tanzanias first female president following the death of President John Magufuli.\n\nShe was initially praised for easing political repression under her predecessor, but the political space has since narrowed, with her government accused of targeting critics through arrests and a wave of abductions.\n\nThe electoral body is expected to announce results in three days after voting ends.\n\n",

The year-on-year inflation rate is derived from the percentage change in the index of the current years reference month compared with the same month of the previous year, said ZimStat.\n\nDuring the same period, the ZWG month-on-month inflation rate stood at 0.4%, slightly lower than the 0.2% recorded in September 2025, indicating a modest decline in average prices.\n\nThis means that prices, as measured by the all-items ZWG CPI, decreased by an average rate of 0.4% from September 2025 to October 2025, the agency added.\n\nThe ZWG month-on-month Food and Non-Alcoholic Beverages inflation rate rose to 0.7% in October 2025, up 0.5 percentage points from 0.2% in September 2025. In contrast, the non-food inflation rate stood at 0.9%, compared to 0.5% the previous month.\n\nOn the USD front, the month-on-month inflation rate for October 2025 was 0.3%, up from 0.0% in September.\n\nThe USD year-on-year inflation rate (annual percentage change) for October 2025, as measured by the all-items USD CPI, was 13%, further underscoring a trend toward stabilising prices in both the local and foreign currency economies.\n\n",

Zimbabweans do not panic, we are going to announce the next course of action after this, said Sikhala.\n\nThe recently adopted resolution by the ruling party at its just-ended conference in Mutare, to set legal wheels in motion for President Mnangagwa to stay beyond 2028, has ignited political tensions.\n\nWithin ZANU-PF, a clique backing Vice President Constantino Chiwenga is opposing the move to amend the constitution, rooting for the former army general to succeed Mnangagwa.\n\nWorld Council of Churches (WCC) programmes director, Kenneth Mtata, said the move to extend Mnangagwas term will have ripple effects on the countrys position in the global community.\n\nThe proposal to extend the presidential term will hurt Zimbabwe at many levels. Here are five main reasons\n\nFirst, it will undermine all the hard work of international re-engagement pursued since 2017. It will signal to global partners that Zimbabwe cannot be trusted to honour its own constitutional and democratic commitments.\n\nSecond, it will jeopardise the ongoing debt restructuring efforts. Third, this extension will discourage investment. Recently, Forbes magazine is said to have identified Zimbabwe as one of the most attractive tourist destinations. Investors would be wary of systems that change rules to suit political convenience. Policy inconsistency and instability will scare away the very capital needed for national economic recovery.\n\nFourth, the term extension will shatter the fragile social trust that had begun to form after years of political violence. Coercive force and intimidation would likely return to our national life in order to enforce such an unpopular measure. This will reopen old wounds and further divide communities once again.\n\nFifth, this decision will remove any chances of the President leaving a positive legacy. He will be classified with all those leaders remembered for clinging to power, rather than those honoured for serving with integrity and stepping aside with dignity, said Mtata.\n\n",

During that time, they contracted occupational diseases such as tuberculosis and silicosis.\n\nThe MoU enables the Tshiamiso Trust to facilitate compensation for former Wenela workers who were employed in the neighbouring country between March 12 1965, and December 10 2019.\n\nTshiamiso Trust Chief Executive Officer, Munyadziwa Kwinda, said the agreement is a turning point for the majority of the former mineworkers and their dependants who have had to endure a long wait.\n\nWe are honoured to mark this moment in partnership with the Government of Zimbabwe and NSSA. Thousands of Zimbabwean ex-mineworkers have been waiting for Tshiamiso Trust services to commence so that they can access compensation that they may qualify for.\n\nTodays agreement means they can now lodge their claims and complete the medical assessments required to determine their eligibility for compensation. This is about restoring dignity and delivering on the promise made to the men and families who built the mining industry, said Kwinda.\n\nProspective claimants, however, must meet certain criteria, including providing proof that they suffered from a work-related illness.\n\nDependants of the deceased can claim after providing proof of relationship and a death certificate indicating the cause of death.\n\nThe National Social Security Authority (NSSA), which partnered with Tshiamiso on behalf of the government, said the compensation will bring relief to the former mineworkers and their dependants.\n\nZimbabwe is home to many who spent their working lives in South Africas mines and returned home with illnesses that changed their futures. Through this collaboration, we are ensuring that those who qualify can now access the compensation due to them, closer to where they live.\n\nNSSA remains committed to working with regional partners like Tshiamiso Trust to expand social security and strengthen cross-border protection for our workers, said NSSA Chief Executive Officer Charles Shava.\n\nThe Tshiamiso Trust has already paid R2.4 billion to 25,000 beneficiaries in Lesotho, South Africa, Mozambique, Eswatini, and Botswana.\n\n",
