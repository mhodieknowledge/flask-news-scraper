In my opinion, we were the better side. Unfortunately, we could not put the ball in the net, said Chigowe.\n\nWith this result, Herentals remain unbeaten in the league, having beaten Telone 2-1 last weekend.\n\nHerentals coach Paul Benza expressed satisfaction with the draw.\n\nIt was a very difficult game. Dynamos came at us strongly in the first half. They had a lot of chances but failed to score, and we are very happy because, at the end of the day, we managed a clean sheet and a point, said Benza.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA DECADE after the disappearance of human rights activist and journalist Itai Dzamara, pressure is mounting on the Zanu PF government to provide answers.\n\nCampaigners and activists have condemned the ruling party, with some branding it a terrorist organisation that must be held to account for Dzamaras disappearance.\n\nItai Dzamara\n\nDzamara was last seen on March 9, 2015, when he was allegedly taken from his home in Glenview, Harare, by State security operatives in an unmarked vehicle.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding his disappearance remain shrouded in mystery, prompting renewed calls for a thorough and transparent investigation.\n\nAward-winning human rights lawyer and Principal Managing Partner at Tsunga Bhamu Law International, Arnold Tsunga, has implored the President Emmerson Mnangagwa-led government to make a public announcement explaining why it has failed to bring the perpetrators of Dzamaras disappearance to justice.\n\nThe government has to do all in its powers to make a public and open announcement on why it has not been possible to bring the perpetrators of the abduction of Itai Dzamara to account, he said.\n\nThe failure of any progress, it really affects human rights activists and in particular it affects the family. The family of a disappeared person, they suffer uncertainty, trauma, and they dont have closure, he added.\n\nIts a threat to the rule of law; its a threat to the justice and accountability. It reduces confidence of people in the ability of our law enforcement system to be able to protect the citizens.\n\nFormer Zengeza West MP Job Sikhala stated that the Zanu PF-led government knows the whereabouts of Dzamara and owes the public an explanation as to what happened to him.\n\nThe regime knows what happened to Itai Dzamara, Sikhala said.\n\nIt is the duty of every government to protect its citizens. The security of every person falls in the hands of the State. We still demand with our loud voices to know what happened to Itai. It remains a serious issue of public interest, he added.\n\nHuman rights defender and Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) president Obert Masaraure minced no words for Zanu PF, describing it as a terrorist organisation and warning that the perpetrators of Dzamaras disappearance would eventually face retribution.\n\nThe Dzamara story reminds us that the Zanu PF party is a terrorist organisation. We will not tire to demand the return of Dzamara. Those who abducted him Dzamara will be forced to pay in the coming Zimbabwe, he said.\n\nEfforts to obtain comment from the government were unsuccessful, as both Information Minister Jenfan Muswere and Information Permanent Secretary Nick Mangwana could not be reached on their mobile phones.\n\nHowever, Zanu PF Director of Communication Farai Marapira asserted that human rights defenders and activists carry the burden of proof, as they are the ones making unfounded allegations against his party, which he described as a law-abiding institution.\n\nHe who alleges must prove. It is sad that some people would seek cheap mileage over another familys anguish. We are a law-abiding institution which holds the laws of our land sacrosanct. It is crass madness to then associate us with such a vile accusation, Marapira said.\n\nZimbabwe has neither signed nor ratified the United Nations International Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance despite repeated calls to do so by UN Member States. The government, it seems, is dragging its feet on this issue.\n\nThis convention came into being in 2006 and started being implemented in 2010.\n\nLast year, human rights lawyer Obey Shava, represented by renowned lawyer Tendai Biti, took Mnangagwas government to the High Court, arguing that the administration must ratify the United Nations Convention against enforced disappearance treaty.\n\nShava deplored what he described as a systematic pattern of enforced disappearance, abduction, torture, and cruel and degrading treatment. He asserted that numerous individuals, including himself, human rights defenders, opposition political party supporters, legislators, and ordinary citizens, have been subjected to these acts, with some also being injected with unknown substances.\n\n",

As usual, I have a very long list of apologies, sadly, said Nyambuya, before reading the list of absentee office bearers.\n\nThe list of apologies is as follows; Hon. General Rtd. Dr. C. D. G. N. Chiwenga, the Vice President; Hon. Colonel Rtd. K. C. D Mohadi, the Vice President; Hon. M. Ncube, Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion; Hon.

Mhona, Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development.\n\nHe went further, Hon. J.G, Moyo, Minister of Energy and Power Development; Hon. K. D. Mnangagwa, the Deputy Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion; Hon. E. Jesaya, Deputy Minister of Sports, Recreation, Arts and Culture; Hon. J.

D. Marapira, Deputy Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Resettlement.\n\nOnly Primary and Secondary Education minister, Torerai Moyo and two deputies were in the august House, which is emblematic of a skewed work ethic.\n\nIn the Chamber today, we have Hon. T. Moyo, Minister of Primary and Secondary Education; Hon. O. Marupi, Deputy Minister of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services and Hon. D. Phuti, Deputy Minister of ICT.\n\nCan we then start with those ministers who are present and hopefully, we will be joined by other ministers as we progress? said the Senate deputy president.\n\nA number of Cabinet ministers are under fire for not attending Parliament business, a development that has incensed Mudenda.\n\nRecently, the Speaker revealed that most Cabinet ministers give apologies on the pretext of being on national duty, something he said should be investigated.\n\nThe Q & A session is one of the most important Parliament business schedules where the public gets answers to policy questions asked by their constituency representatives (MPs) from Cabinet ministers.\n\nIn recent years, the two VPs and ministers have evaded the session, leaving citizens starved of crucial information needed to track progress of elected officials.\n\nSeveral MPs have raised their concerns since the previous Parliament until now (10th Parliament), with the Speaker at one point threatening to report culprits to President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nAfter listening to this, there are quite clear apologies that have been very consistent to you. And my suspicion is that these ministers who make apologies cannot be on national duty every week, Mudenda lamented.\n\nMnangagwa has also issued a stern warning to Cabinet ministers, who habitually skip his weekly Cabinet meetings, delegating their deputies to attend in their place.\n\nWhile chairing his final cabinet meeting of 2024 at State House, December 17, Mnangagwa warned that such delegation would not be tolerated in 2025.\n\nHe said in the 2025 calendar year, the Chief Secretary is directed to strictly monitor attendance and ensure that errant ministers and officials toe the line, or face dire consequences.\n\n",

            "content": "By newZWire\n\nRUNNING a business in Zimbabwe means dealing with the unexpected. For Simbisa, the countrys largest fast-food company, the year began with fresh taxes that could bite into sales.\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncube initially proposed a 0.5% tax in his budget statement, only to bump it up to 1% for implementation in January. He also threw in a new 20% tax on plastic bags.\n\nThis came as consumer spending in Simbisa outlets dipped. Average spend per customer fell by 3% in the last half-year, even though customer numbers rose by 7% to 24.8 million. This means the company has had to absorb the costs while finding ways to bridge the gap. Its strategy? Open more outlets, sell more chicken, and manage costs better.\n\nWere adapting to the 1% fast-food tax, says CEO Basil Dionisio.\n\nOn January 1, we all woke up to a lovely new year, and we were told its half a percent. Then the SI came out, and its 1%. We havent raised prices. Were absorbing itby growing our customer base, increasing volume, and passing that benefit to consumers.\n\nSimbisa opened a net of 38 new outlets between December 2023 and the end of 2024, with 16 of those in the last half of the year. By June, another 10 outlets will be added. Over the next 18 months, the company plans to launch 81 new counters and refurbish 60 existing ones.\n\nAnd what about the plastic bags tax?\n\nWe want to transition to 100% paper packagingno more little plastic carrier bags, Dionisio says.\n\nThis shift aligns with global industry trends. The company is also exploring new sustainable packaging solutions for its Creamy Inn ice creams.\n\nAfter that, we should have no more plastic in our operations.\n\nBeyond opening new outlets, Simbisa is also betting on increased adoption of its delivery services, which remain low in Zimbabwe compared to other markets.\n\nThe company is increasing cost containment, including pushing energy savings, while working with suppliers to negotiate better terms.\n\n",
