The accused person paid US$400 to Sibanda, who is now on the run.\n\nThe court heard that in April 2024, Madhumbe received a forged HEXCO statement of results bearing distinctions in the failed subjects.\n\nUpon submitting his OJET application, examination staff noticed inconsistencies in the font size of his results sheet. A check in the National Examinations Management Information System (NEMIS) exposed the fraud.\n\nProsecutors told the court that Madhumbe was confronted, and he admitted that he obtained the fake results from Sibanda.\n\n",

She shares her own experiences along with tips on wellness, cooking, and relationships.\n\nWhile some praised her for the show, others accused her of being a wannabeMartha Stewart.\n\nAnother person on the critique seat is her father, who has also voiced his disappointment over his daughters latest series, calling it inauthentic and out of touch with reality.\n\nHe particularly took issue with her decision to distance herself from the Markle name and her claims about growing up as a latchkey kid, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nThomas, who relocated to the Philippines earlier this year, has not watched the entire show but has seen clips online. Based on what he has seen, he feels Meghan appears overly rehearsed.\n\nYou have to be authentic to hold peoples attention, he said. Unfortunately, Meghan has never been authentic. She has to think about everything. Shes not spontaneous. Everything she says is pre-planned and rehearsed.\n\nThe formerHollywoodlighting director also dismissed Meghans claims that she grew up eating TV dinners and fast food, insisting that he provided a comfortable life for her.\n\nWe occasionally ate TV dinners, which family doesnt? But I was working two jobs, so money was never an issue. We would eat out at least three times a week and order in the rest of the time, he said.\n\nHe recalled frequently taking Meghan to high-end restaurants in Hollywood.\n\nThomas also criticised Meghans cooking style in the show, calling her approach impractical for ordinary viewers.\n\nMeghan should make affordable food and show people how to stretch their food budget, he said, pointing out that she frequently uses expensive ingredients like edible flowers and elaborate fruit platters.\n\nI dont think most people these days can afford to go out and spend $90 (R1 644) on fruit. Shes out of touch with normal people, he said.\n\nSending kids off to school with edible flowers on their food is silly. Kids dont like them, and if you put edible flowers in a kids lunchbox, they would probably get teased at school.\n\nDaddy dearest isnt happy or proud of his daughter in her moment.Thomas has been estranged from Meghan since her 2018 wedding to Prince Harry, which he missed due to health issues.\n\nDespite their fallout, he still recalls their last shared meal fondly  a reminder of a relationship that seems far from mending.\n\n",

Work is already underway, with teams camped in Hwange, Halfway, and Insiza to ensure the road is rehabilitated efficiently, the statement reads.\n\nLast year, the government announced a partnership with Bitumen World to rebuild the heavily damaged Beitbridge-Victoria Falls Highway under a build, operate, and transfer model.\n\nBitumen will fund, construct, and manage the road for profit before eventually transferring it to public ownership.\n\nMeanwhile, opposition politician Gift Ostallos Siziba posted a video on his social media accounts showing the roads bad condition, with potholes widely blamed for causing accidents.\n\nHe accused authorities of neglecting the road despite its critical role in tourism.\n\nYesterday, I witnessed this shocking reality firsthand on my way to Victoria Falls. The road leading to one of the worlds most iconic tourist attractions is in a deplorable state of disrepair.\n\nThe number of potholes has reached catastrophic levels, causing trucks to lose their axles and leading to an alarming increase in accidents. This critical route, which should be a showcase for Zimbabwes tourism industry, has been grossly neglected by the regime in Harare, Siziba wrote.\n\n",

We have created an environment where they will earn money because their investment will be guaranteed, said Moyo.\n\nUS Energy Secretary Chris Wright explained the dramatic change in policy as being advised by global needs and challenges that far outweigh climate change concerns.\n\nWright highlighted that previous energy policies that discouraged the use of fossil fuels had also inhibited the growth of African economies.\n\nWe want to partner with Africa in technology, capital investment and energy infrastructure. You decide what works for your people and we will work with you to make it happen, he said.\n\nMoyo, who was accompanied by Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube, said American investment was welcome in power generation but extraction of coalbed methane gas which is abundant in Hwange and Chiredzi areas.\n\nHe added: We are an agricultural country, we want our fertilisers, so any investment in that coalbed methane gas, we could end up doing our fertilisers, which we are importing right now, and as a country that believes very strongly in agriculture, that would be a good investment.\n\nZimbabwe and the US have not seen eye to eye for over two decades.

But Wolves paid just 16 million for Munetsi, and that is already looking like a bargain.\n\nPhysically, hes so powerful and capable of winning battles against his opponents, while his movement and ability to sniff out chances are commendable attributes.\n\nFor most of his Wolves career so far, hes spurned some golden chances, but tonight he showed composure in the box to score and long may it continue.\n\nAlthough Wolves have been reliant on Cunha, its refreshing to see others step up to the plate, as Munetsi is easily someone who could hit double figures for goals in a season.\n\n",

The intention and purpose of the law is however far removed from that perspective.\n\nIn Zimbabwe people normally live together as husband and wife under the following marriage regimes, as a couple under a civil marriage, that is a marriage registered under the Marriages Act Chapter 5:11 which was formerly and is still commonly known by many as Chapter 37, a qualified civil marriage which is potentially polygamous and is solemnized by a Minister of religion, normally for the Islamic religion. There is also the registered or unregistered customary marriage, which involves the payment of lobola and is also potentially polygamous.\n\nHowever, there are many couples who live together and have lived together for years as husband and wife and have not formalized their union under any of the categories I stated. Those are ultimately the people the law was put in place to protect.\n\nIt is really a question of equity and justice more than anything else.\n\nReporter: Am not completely convinced, however, please explain to us what a civil partnership is?\n\nVM: In Zimbabwe, firstly, a civil partnership is a relationship between a man and woman , this is important as some countries extend the definition to include people of the same sex in a relationship.\n\nThe man and woman must be above the age of 18, meaning that they are able to contract a marriage in Zimbabwe. They should also have lived together as a couple under a genuine domestic basis. A variety of circumstances are considered here, but in summary, it must be established that they were living together as husband and wife but for the actual formal solemnizing of their relationship under the categories I mentioned earlier.\n\nThe couple cannot be of the same bloodline, that is brother and sister, first or second cousins. There are exceptions in law to first and second cousins, which exceptions include, whether or not the couple knew that they were relatedet ceterabut that is a discussion for another day.\n\nReporter:So how does one prove that they qualify as a civil partnership, what is the criteria?\n\nVM: Well, the law has left this to the courts to interpret what qualifies as a civil partnership for purposes of enjoying the rights that follow. There is no set criteria that states that this or that is what is necessary to prove before it can be considered as a civil partnership. We can say that the law is developing in that area.\n\nEach case is dealt with according to its own circumstances.\n\nThey are however issues the courts will consider in varying circumstances, issues like how long the relationship lasted, the nature and extent of their living in together or common residence, the degree or extent of their financial dependence or interdependence. The couple may have also bought property togetheret cetera. The relationship has to be of a sexual nature off -course.\n\nReporter: So in terms of explanation for qualification, small houses will have marriage rights should that relationship come to an end?\n\nVM: I suppose we have come back to the question we started on.\n\nThe law does recognize that some civil partnerships may include what you are terming as small houses and some rights do follow dissolution of civil partnership.\n\nA court that is ceased with the task of dissolving the civil partnership where there is to be distribution of assets or there are such claims will pay due regard and not ignore the rights of the other spouse who is not party to this dissolution. Long and short, the assets that belong to the spouse, if proved to be the assets of the spouse, will not form a part of civil partnership property if I can loosely call it that.\n\nReporter: So does the claim by a small house dissolving a civil partnership not expose the married person to the crime of bigamy?\n\nVM: I will repeat that the law on civil partnerships is not limited to the issue of small houses. It is for people who live together in a domestic sexual relationship.\n\nTo your question, the dissolution of a civil partnership where one partner has a spouse under a civil marriage, the law has specifically excluded the crime of bigamy, so no, the married person will not be exposed to the crime of bigamy.\n\nReporter: Does this law extend to the question of inheritance for people under civil partnerships when one dies?\n\nVM: The Marriages Act of 2022 does not specifically include the word inheritance and the laws that protect spouses on the death of a spouse do not automatically apply. It goes back to the point that the civil partnership may have to be proved to the satisfaction of the court to qualify for inheritance or a claim on the estate of the deceased.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",
