It is estimated that Zimbabwe produces approximately 150 000 tons of black granite annually with Mutoko contributing about 75% of that output.EMA Mashonaland East provincial spokesperson, Astas Mabwe this work commended rising appreciation levels on matters of environmental concern.Off-hand as EMA, I wouldnt be able to tell the statistics district by district, but I would say in Togo generally, most of the granite mines have Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) certificates. In very few cases where you find those people starting their operations without an EIA. But the residual problematic areas are in the Makaha area where small-scale gold miners ply their trade, he said.Mabwe urged local communities to insist on conducting EIAs saying such procedures are the cornerstones of resolving all the potential disputes way before they go out of hand.He said the document avails the opportunity for communities to say out their worries, what they think may be violated and gives the proponent an opportunity to provide answers.We would like to applaud Silveira House for supporting such efforts which have made us realise these high environmental awareness levels. They have assisted in making environmental protection a reality.At the end of the day, what we want is sustainability. While miners get money from these mineral resources, there is need to balance such goals with environmental preservation.So they are really helping the government to have a conscious society. We really applaud them, and they have called us as EMA at various platforms, and we are proud of that, said Mabwe.However, Mutoko RDC Ward 10 Councillor, Robert Mabvuta said while some notable progress has been made, there is still need to raise awareness and strengthen communities appreciation of EIAs processes to stop miners from shortchanging communities.Ward 5 Councillor, David Kadiki called on authorities to find ways to punish miners, who evade conducting EIAs and those who fail to adhere to what they agreed on with the communities.\n\nThe Mashonaland East town hosts some of the countrys largest black granite miners as well as some gold mines.

The black majority was confined to communal lands and all but completely excluded from commercial farming.\n\nThis mirrored our own experience in South Africa.\n\nIt was, therefore, essential for both historical redress and food security, development and economic growth that the government embarked on ambitious reforms to facilitate the entry of black Zimbabweans into productive agriculture, including support to small-scale farmers, Ramaphosa said.\n\nHe also congratulated Zimbabwe for the measures being taken to revive the countrys agricultural sector through policy reforms, investment in irrigation and mechanisation, and empowering large and small-scale farmers.\n\nWe know that the agricultural sector has been heavily affected by the growing impacts of the changing climate.\n\nSevere drought has impacted crop yields in recent years.\n\nAdapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change are an imperative for all nations. Collaboration among countries is critical to the success of these efforts, added the South African President.\n\nHe said: Biosecurity is another area in which Zimbabwe and South Africa must step up cooperation.\n\nOutbreaks of foot and mouth disease, avian or bird flu, crop infections and others, call on us to pool our resources and strengthen our collaboration, including through our respective research institutions.\n\nThe SA President explained that technological trends in agriculture must be fully embraced to increase output and conserve resources.\n\nBy way of example, geo-spacial agriculture using earth observation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has started to feature in some sectors of agriculture in South Africa and Zimbabwe.\n\nSuch innovation will be key as we collectively build resilience in pursuit of food security, he stated.\n\nEven amidst these challenges, Ramaphosa said a constant feature at ZAS had been the commitment to use agriculture as a catalyst for economic growth, sustainable development and historical redress.\n\nThe hosting of this agriculture show resonates with the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme, which seeks to improve domestic production and marketing as well as the facilitation of regional trade in food staples.\n\nIt will also help to make our industries more competitive in the global trading market and to make use of the substantial opportunities of the African Continental Free Trade Area, he stated.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), agriculture accounts for between 60 and 80 percent of employment in the region.\n\nWe must, therefore, work towards a more enabling regulatory environment to further boost this sector.\n\nWe need increased investment in small and medium farming entities, particularly those owned and run by women and the youth.\n\nPresident (Emmerson) Mnangagwa and I recently attended the SADC Summit in Madagascar, where agricultural transformation in the region was a major point of discussion.\n\nI call on the private sectors in both Zimbabwe and South Africa to use this show to explore avenues for great collaboration that will result in more trade and investment across our borders.\n\nAgricultural cooperation is key to sustaining jobs.\n\nWe need investment in the provision of seeds, training, irrigation schemes, storage facilities and in agro-processing.\n\nThe development of road, rail and aviation infrastructure is a key catalyst to take agriculture to an even higher level, Ramaphosa added.\n\n",
