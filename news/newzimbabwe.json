We are all accountable to the President of the Republic in our various workstations.\n\nSo, we must be able to find each other. I told the Mayor of Bulawayo (David Coltart) last week that we have come here not to fight, but to build bridges, Garwe said.\n\nHe revealed that some people were expecting fights in their minds, which was not the mission.\n\nSo, we said there are some ways to build bridges. All these cities, the 32 urban councils, are all ours.\n\nThe 60 rural councils are all ours. There is no person who exists in this kind that doesnt belong to a vote. So, this is how important local authorities are to everybody.\n\nWe do not want to be focusing on fault finding. We want to be focusing on correcting the areas where we are not doing well. We should be able to be corrected as well, he told the officials.\n\nResults for the local authorities performance released showed that most of them had failed to reach their targets for the year.\n\nLet us take responsibility whenever there is something that we have done correctly. There is no one under the sun who does not make a mistake, nobody.\n\nAll of us make mistakes, but the ability to be able to sit down and diagnose the problem and provide the cure is what makes us different from the rest of the people.\n\nGarwe urged the local authorities bosses to tackle challenges without looking at which party one belonged to.\n\nWe must attend ourselves into challenges. In here, we do not have councillors belonging to political parties. We have councillors belonging to government.\n\nWe are all accountable to government, we are all accountable to this existence. So we leave behind all this political culture behaviour the moment we are sworn into offices.\n\nFurther, he said, Right now, there are no any chances. We do not need to be mudslinging. We do need to speak to each other, working together to turn around the fortunes of our local authorities.\n\nThe minister also urged council officials and councillors to change their mindset and forget about past fights.\n\nThe local authorities in central government, officials from the minister of Local Government, change your mindset in a positive attitude towards our local authorities.\n\nWe humbly request you to leave positive attitude towards central government.\n\nWe are one government with one vision. We want to turn- around the local governance and avoid focus on what happened in the past, said Garwe, adding What is done is done. Let us focus on the future.\n\nMost local authorities have not done well in the service provision in the last years, mainly due to political fights and corruption, prompting government to privatise most of the services especially in Harare.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nHARARE residents have expressed anger over the planned partnership between the City of Harare (CoH) and emergency services company, Discovery Ambulance, arguing the public would likely shoulder the burden of being double billed.\n\nCouncil is pushing to partner Discovery in delivering emergency services to residents with provision of ambulances.The deal is expected to plug the shortage of ambulances in Harare amid revelations the local authority has only two functional ambulances.In a statement, Harare Residents Trust (HRT) said privatisation of the services is not a panacea to alleviating the challenges in the capitals health system.There is a current lobby within the City of Harare for Discovery Ambulance Services to provide ambulance services to residents of Harare, and bill the City of Harare in the process. This deal is similar to the Pomona Ddumpsite deal in many ways.Privatisation of public services is not the best way to improve health service delivery, read the statement.HRT added that residents are paying for the emergency services through their monthly rentals. However it is unclear how the funds have been used by council in addressing the health system.The City of Harare has, since the beginning of the year, been collecting from Harare residents an Emergency Services Levy with the main objective of purchasing ambulances for the city.Given the number of properties being billed in Harare, it is estimated that $500,000 is being raised monthly from the Emergency Services Levy. Unfortunately, no ambulance has been bought using that revenue stream, said HRT.Discovery Ambulance Services is owned by Zanu PF member David Munowenyu, who has been working with the Presidential Health Scheme.The company has been earmarked with a partnership with the CoH.
