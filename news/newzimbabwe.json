            "content": "By BBC\n\nTHE trial of Diego Maradonas medical staff has collapsed in Argentina after it was found that a judge involved in the case had taken part in a documentary about it.\n\nThe judge in charge of the proceedings said the trial, which began on 11 March and was expected to last until July, would have to start again.Seven members of Maradonas medical team were charged with negligent homicide relating to the former footballers death in 2020. They deny the allegations.One of the three presiding judges, Julieta Makintach, stepped down this week.Maradona, a former Napoli and Argentina midfielder, had been recovering at his home in Buenos Aires from brain surgery for a blood clot in November 2020 when he died of a heart attack, aged 60.Among the medical team on trial are a neurosurgeon, a doctor and a night nurse. They claim the retired footballer refused further treatment and should have stayed at home for longer after his operation.If convicted, they face between eight and 25 years in prison.Earlier this week, Prosecutor Patricio Ferrari accused Makintach of behaving like an actress and not a judge after she took part in a documentary about the case.As a trailer for the documentary series, called Divine Justice, was played in court, defence lawyer Rodolfo Baque shouted trash! at Makintach.Maradonas daughter Gianinna and his former partner Veronica Ojeda both cried after seeing the footage.It is a violation of court rules for unauthorised filming to take place and the documentary was being filmed without the permission of the court.Following criticism for taking part in the show, Makintach said she had no choice but to excuse herself from the case.The trial was then adjourned pending the decision on Thursday, which ultimately was to declare a mistrial.Since beginning, the trial had heard the testimony of almost 50 witnesses, including Maradonas daughters.The date for the new trial was not initially set and new judges were not nominated.\n\nThe judge in charge of the proceedings said the trial, which began on 11 March and was expected to last until July, would have to start again.\n\nSeven members of Maradonas medical team were charged with negligent homicide relating to the former footballers death in 2020.

Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.We must pray that our leaders are granted the wisdom and discernment to see the struggles of the people they serve, especially in our rural areas where the affliction of hunger is most prevalent and severe.Thanksgiving for efforts madeLet us also take a moment to express our gratitude for the efforts already made by our government and local authorities. They are striving to provide for their people, and we commend them for this. However, it is clear that more needs to be done.We must uplift our leaders in prayer, asking God to inspire them to increase their feeding initiatives and ensure that every resident has access to the food they need.A prayer for our leadershipHeavenly Father, we come before You with heavy hearts.

You can get scholarships to study in China, and also, with the rapidly growing Chinese economy, there is an opportunity for trade, so we can leverage the opportunity to create an amicable relationship between Zimbabwe and China, he said.Thandeka Risinamhodzi, a high school student from Harare, was elated to be crowned the champion in the high school students segment.Chinese is a very exciting language that you can learn. Learning Chinese benefits in many ways, like in Zimbabwe, most things involve the Chinese, like job opportunities, she said.Makoni and Risinamhodzi will represent Zimbabwe at the international finals of the Chinese Bridge competition in China later this year.In his address to the contest, Attwell Mamvuto, pro-vice-chancellor for academic affairs and administration at the University of Zimbabwe, said the competition not only celebrates linguistic excellence, but also marks the enduring friendship and cooperation between the two countries.Learning a new language opens doors to new opportunities, fosters understanding, and builds bridges between people from different backgrounds. The Chinese language, with its rich history and vast number of speakers, is a particularly valuable asset. It also augurs well with the University of Zimbabwes strategic thrust on the internationalization agenda as well as academic and cultural exchanges, he said.Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Zhou Ding said the growing number of Zimbabweans learning Chinese demonstrates the languages global prominence and the importance and vitality of the enduring partnership between China and Zimbabwe.This year, as we celebrate the 45th anniversary of China-Zimbabwe diplomatic relations, which are rooted in solidarity, shared aspiration, and mutual benefit, we also celebrate decades of our joint achievements, which include the robust educational and cultural collaboration between our two countries, Zhou added.\n\nDrawing participants from primary schools, high schools, and colleges, the competition consisted of a speech in Chinese and a talent show.\n\nKudakwashe Makoni, a student of political science and diplomacy at the University of Zimbabwe, stood out with his grasp of the Chinese language and knowledge of Chinese culture.He told Xinhua that the Chinese language serves not only as a practical skill to learn in a globalized world, but also as a bridge between the two countries.Learning Chinese provides huge opportunities for Zimbabweans.

Built at a cost of US$88m, the interchange is a shoddy, vulgar sobriquet of raw looting and grandiose theft of public funds, Biti wrote on his X account Saturday.\n\nThe US$88m is way out of line with comparative regional projects that have cost significantly less. For instance, SAs Mount Edgecombe project, the biggest in Africa which cost US$70 million.\n\nThe former Treasury chief also labelled Mnangagwas government as a mafia group, which bypassed tender processes and awarded the contract to build such a huge project to Mnangagwas alleged cronies.\n\nThe project was not subject to international tender but instead was awarded to a local cartel and its associates, that has been at the centre of massive looting of public coffers since 2017.\n\nThe cartel has been the biggest recipient of all Treasury Bills issued in this country and has been active in Command Agriculture, mining, fuel, banking, financial services, buses, roads, hospitals, retail and general procurement, he said.\n\nBiti called on Parliament to carry out a forensic audit to establish how the project was funded, saying the entire financing process has been opaque, contrary to Public Finance Management principles, which emphasise on transparency and accountability.\n\nThese questions arise because of the predatory veil of opaqueness that has been the MO (modus operandi) of the regime. Parliament must cause a forensic audit of this project and examining legal financial & engineering constructs of this pagoda. Corruption must stop.\n\nMeanwhile, the public, through social media, has voiced concerns regarding the project and expressed shock that it cost US$88 million, attacking Mnangagwa and his government as corrupt leaders.\n\n",

their forms as Highlanders are sitting on ninth position with 18 points while Dynamos are in the relegation zone (16) with nine points, that is two more than bottom-placed Kwekwe United.For Kelvin Kaindu, Sundays clash is a chance to revive his sides form.I think it comes at the time or probably at the weekend where both teams recorded losses.Im sure that this is also going to help both teams to go out, attack and search for victory.We are eyeing maximum points and we will do our best to get that, said Kaindu.Highlanders recorded a double over Dynamos last season, 2-0 and 2-1 in the first and second leg respectively.However, Kaindu is not sitting on last seasons dominance over their rivals, rather he is anticipating a tough encounter this time around.Not taking away anything from both teams, regardless of their position, I think this is a different game.Theres a lot at stake just for you to pick up those maximum points, added Kaindu.Dynamos have won one match out of 13 and a win

2-0 and 2-1 in the first and second leg respectively.However, Kaindu is not sitting on last seasons dominance over their rivals, rather he is anticipating a tough encounter this time around.Not taking away anything from both teams, regardless of their position, I think this is a different game.Theres a lot at stake just for you to pick up those maximum points, added Kaindu.Dynamos have won one match out of 13 and a win against Highlanders will be the first for their new head coach Saul Chaminuka, who was appointed two weeks ago.\n\nI think it comes at the time or probably at the weekend
