            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nBorn in 1991 as the youngest and only son in a family of three, Tanaka Tank Mupfurutsa has remained steadfast in his pursuit of business success, undeterred by the unpredictable highs and lows of entrepreneurship.\n\nWhile his siblings have sought opportunities abroad, Mupfurutsa chose to stay in Zimbabwe, founding Apex Travel Zimbabwe, a premier travel and tours operator among other business ventures.\n\nHe continues to navigate the countrys challenging economic terrain with courage and determination, all while supporting his family and building a name for himself in the local business landscape.\n\nAt just 19 years old, he launched Black Bean Investments, a candle and maputi (puffed maize snack) manufacturing company  laying the foundation for a bigger vision.\n\nIn an interview withNewZimbabwe.com, Mupfurutsa shares his successes and sorrows, highlighting the guiding principle behind his resilience: Keep changing. Nothing will work without God in it.\n\nIt was not easy, he said, recalling his encounters with the police after overloading his car with maputi but this did not deter him from achieving his goals.\n\nInstead, they became anecdotes of persistence and hustle.\n\nMupfurutsa invested in his own maputi machines. Scaling up, he was processing tonnes of maize and supplying major retailers.\n\nA milestone came when he landed a contract with Afro Foods, distributing 10,000 packets three times a week to over 15 retail outlets around Harare City. The business later suffered due to the collapse of Afro Foods but he remained undeterred.\n\nWhile pursuing a Business Studies and Computing Science degree at the University of Zimbabwe (graduated 2013), Mupfurutsa co-founded Campus Culture, where he served as finance director.\n\nThe student-led enterprise published magazines, hosted events, and even represented the university in a national ICT innovation competition.\n\nDespite multiple job offers, including from Delta Beverages and Document Support Centre, he chose entrepreneurship  the less-travelled path, and that was the birth of Apex Travel.\n\nApex Travel was formally registered in 2014 as an educational tours company.With unwavering zeal, Mupfurutsa and his team visited over ten schools daily, earning the trust of clients one handshake at a time.\n\nApex Travel grew into a leading brand, known for luxurious and unforgettable school trips. The company revolutionised the industry by offering high-end experiences to studentsluxury coach rides, five-star hotel stays, and fully guided educational experiences.\n\nOne of Apex Travels historic achievements was chartering a full Boeing aircraft through Fly Africa, taking 140 students from Haig Park Primary School to Victoria Falls.\n\nAnother proud moment came when Apex Travel booked out the entire Caribbea Bay Hotel for a school tour. Apex became a household name in schools across Zimbabwe and was known for setting industry trends.\n\nThe business expanded rapidly: Apex now included car rental, vehicle tracking, and eventually roadside assistance.\n\nTheir custom vehicle tracking system became a unique product in Zimbabwe. Developed in collaboration with Chinese manufacturers, Apex Trackers now provide features such as live tracking, remote vehicle immobilisation, driver behaviour analytics, geo-fencing, playback history, and microphone surveillance.\n\nApex Travelenforces strict client verification, including fingerprinting and ID capture, which has helped maintain a clean fleet and high customer integrity.\n\nThe car rental fleet grew to include sedans, mid-range SUVs, double cabs, fuel savers, luxury SUVs like the 300 series, and Mercedes-Benz S-Class models.\n\nInterestingly, COVID-19 became a defining period for Apex Travel. Though the travel business paused, car rental surged as companies sought vehicles for restricted local movement.\n\nMupfurutsa reallocated funds from his home construction to fleet expansion, turning a crisis into an opportunity. It was during this time that Apex Travel solidified car rental as its flagship division.\n\nIn addition to that, Mupfurutsa acquired haulage trucks from a distressed seller, further diversifying his assets. With no initial plan, he instinctively knew it was a strategic purchase and it proved fruitful.\n\nHis late father was always the first to test-drive any new vehicle and validate each major acquisition. His passing in February 2023 from cancer was a deep personal loss, but his legacy remains central to Mupfurutsas journey.\n\nMupfurutsas personal resilience was again tested when their nearly completed family home caught fire due to negligence by a caretaker.\n\nDespite the destruction, his father encouraged him to finish the project, calling it the test of time. With support from loyal contractors, some whom refused payment, he rebuilt the house.\n\nToday, Tanaka Mupfurutsa stands tall as a visionary entrepreneur, husband, father, and innovator who continues to grow Apex Travel into one of Zimbabwes most dynamic service providers across travel, logistics, and tech-enabled fleet services.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) says easing ZWG rates are indicative of the local currencys economic stabilising effect.\n\nThe ZiG month-on-month inflation slightly decreased to settle at 0.3% in the month of June 2025 from 0.9% recorded in the month of May 2025.\n\nThe prolonged period of inflation at rates below 1% since February 2025 generally reflect a ZiG price stabilising economy. In addition, this may also indicate success of monetary policy in restoring price discipline as compared to past experiences with the Zimbabwean dollar (ZWL), said CZI.\n\nThe industry lobby group said the low levels of inflation will help build trust in the currency, which might also encourage greater usage of ZiG in transactions and could also boost the likelihood of a gradual de-dollarisation process leading to a ZiG mono currency regime by 2030.\n\nThe ZiG year-on-year inflation rate slightly increased to settle at 92.5% in the month of June 2025 (Figure 2), gaining 0.4 percentage points from a rate of 92.1% recorded in May 2025. While the month-on-month inflation is showing that inflation is currently under control, the high annual inflation rate reflects historical price instability legacies whose effects are still at play, said CZI.\n\nThe industry lobby group said the high annual inflation level creates pricing uncertainty, making it difficult for businesses to set prices, forecast costs, or even to negotiate contracts.\n\nTherefore, sustaining month-on-month inflation at the current low rates is crucial for eliminating this high annual inflation, which is expected to only start falling in October 2025. Only then will restoring confidence in the ZiG, protecting real incomes, and supporting sustainable economic recovery become more realistic, added CZI.\n\n",
