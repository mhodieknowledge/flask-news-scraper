Investigations by Zimbabwean journalist Maynard Manyowa, of UK-based Dug Up, exposed the fraud.\n\nA copy of the diploma was shared online in the run-up to ZIFA elections as Magaya unsuccessfully sought to fight the football bodys decision to bar him from contesting on grounds he did not have an ordinary level qualification or anything equivalent.\n\nMagaya, who heads the Prophetic Healing and Deliverance (PHD) Ministries presented the fake diploma at the High Court earlier this month.\n\nThe university came across a video clip in the social media domain, wherein Mr Magaya claims to have received an honorary doctorate from UNISA, reads the academic institutions letter dated January 29, 2025.\n\nThe university has never conferred any honorary doctorate on Mr Magaya and strongly condemns this false claim.\n\nWe believe that conduct of this nature damages and brings our brand into disrepute and we reserve the right to take appropriate corrective action. Relevant authorities within the university have therefore been requested to take the necessary legal action in this regard.\n\nAccording to state-controlled broadcaster ZBC, hundreds gathered to watch as Magaya was conferred with the PhD at UNISAs Miriam Makeba Hall in Pretoria.\n\nAt the time, Magaya said he hoped the acknowledgement would be a lesson to Zimbabwes citizens.\n\nIt gives a small lesson to the citizens that one must receive their flowers while they are still alive, Magaya said.\n\nMagaya has not responded to the scandal.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA ZANU PF faction has reacted angrily to recent press statements by war veterans denouncing machinations by President Emmerson Mnangagwas hangers-on to perpetuate his stay in office beyond 2028.\n\nSince Mnangagwa seemingly declined overtures to extend his incumbency courtesy of a Zanu PF National Peoples Conference 2024 resolution now dubbed Resolution #1 arguing he is a constitutionalist, his loyalists have led the 2030 agenda begging him to remain in office.\n\nA coterie of war veterans led by Zanu PF Central Committee member, Blessed Runesu Geza popularly known as Bombshell for his acerbic tongue, was first to savage Mnangagwa calling him a failed leader, who must step down or face unspecified action.\n\nGezas Harare presser was followed by yet another one by Zimbabwe National Liberation War Veterans Association (ZNLWVA) organising secretary, Ben Ncube, who said ex-combatants are at variance with the 82-year-old Zanu PF leaders ill-conceived plan to amend the Constitution in order to extend his self-serving rule beyond his 2028 second term constitutional limit.\n\nThe temerity of the two cliques of rogue war veterans tempted political observers to conclude they were mercenaries for Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, who is the frontrunner to succeed Mnangagwa whose second and final term expires in 2028.\n\nRELATED:Mnangagwa is a failure and must go now, his 2030 agenda is illegal and treacherous  say war veterans miffed by rampant corruption\n\nHowever, in a lengthy address beamed on State television, ZBC, Tuesday night Information Minister, Jenfan Muswere singled out Geza for attack describing his vitriol as unwarranted and a display of hypocrisy.\n\nMuswere said government was not amused by the bitterness, indisciplined and reactionary and unmerited polemic sentiment shared by the war veterans seeking to undermine Mnangagwa.\n\nWe are concerned about the extent to which these individuals, while purporting to be members of the ruling party (and) bona fide members of the war veterans fraternity, are not using legal and relevant structures to discuss their grievances.\n\nIt is unfortunate that these individuals have also played to the whims of demonising the President for reasons best known to them.\n\nWhat is surprising is that such individuals, including Cde Blessed Geza, was one of the lead proponents of Resolution Number 1 of the 21st National Peoples Conference, which underscores the need for the President to remain in office until 2030. Cde Geza was among the conference delegates who lobbied for that resolution to be passed.\n\nTherefore, it is surprising that today he is turning his back on a resolution he helped create. It is unfortunate that the bitterness he suffered from the 2018 primary election defeat is now causing him to go as far as rewriting the history of the President, said Muswere.\n\nThe lnformation minister claims Gezas statement was surprising, especially considering that the Second Republic respects war veterans.\n\nThis sense of self-contradiction and hypocrisy goes against the principles of basic honesty we expect from senior citizens and genuine war veterans.\n\nThis charade is very disappointing considering the magnitude of economic transformation that Zimbabwe has enjoyed under the leadership of the President His Excellency Cde Dr Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa.\n\nSection 84 of the Constitution of Zimbabwe obliges all State institutions and progressive Zimbabweans to recognise Rights of Veterans of the Liberation Struggle.\n\nThese architects of our national liberation include those who fought in the War of Liberation; the virtuous gallant Sons and Daughters of the Soil who assisted the fighters in the war of liberation; and anti-colonial visionaries who were imprisoned, detained and restricted for political reasons during the liberation struggle. Through their unflinching resolve, independent Zimbabwe was born.\n\nPursuant to this clear constitutional position, the Second Republic, under the revolutionary leadership of the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, His Excellency Cde Dr E.D. Mnangagwa has championed a deliberate welfare support for the veterans of the liberation struggle, said Muswere.\n\nWar veterans, Muswere added, were recognised by establishing a stand-alone ministry to cater for their welfare. Zanu PF has also set up a parallel wing of ex-freedom fighters.\n\nThis, Muswere claimed, was to ensure the total inclusion and participation of veterans of the liberation struggle in the economy.\n\nThe actualisation of this constitutional recognition of this important class of distinguished patriots has been facilitated by the establishment of a standalone ministry which caters for the socio-economic needs of veterans of the liberation struggle.\n\nFor the first time, four decades after the attainment of Zimbabwes independence, the Second Republic strengthened the constitutional recognition of the veterans of the liberation struggle by ensuring that the ruling Zanu PF now has a stand-alone War Veterans Wing, said Muswere, adding Mnangagwa had championed over 8,000 developmental projects since assuming office in 2017.\n\n",

Back then it could import 12 million litres duty-free and the extension to 2026 allows it an additional 1.95 million litres.\n\nMoti made headlines in 2023 after an independent investigation exposed a US$120 million chrome scandal involving President Emmerson Mnangagwa, his deputy Constantino Chiwenga and local tycoon Kuda Tagwireyi.\n\nAccording to the investigation by the Sentry organisation, the deal was struck on November 17, 2017, during the week-long coup that brought President Mnangagwa and Vice President Chiwenga to power. The Sentry is an investigative and policy organization that seeks to disable multinational predatory networks that benefit from violent conflict, repression, and kleptocracy.\n\nThe report made revelations that Moti paid $3 million to firms linked to Mnangagwa and Chiwenga following the signing of the chrome deal.\n\nKnown for his addiction to fast cars and cigars, Moti, dabbled in property development and private jets, but his main business in Zimbabwe was processing chrome.1 In 2014 he bought 70% of African Chrome Fields (ACF) and in 2015 applied for national project status which was granted that same year.\n\nRELATED:\n\nThe notice on the duty waiver was rubber-stamped by the Finance and Investment Promotion Minister, Mthuli Ncube under the countrys Customs regulations.\n\nIt is hereby notified that the Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion has in terms of Section 235 as read with Section 120 of the Customs and Excise Act made the following regulations.\n\nThe Customs and Excise Suspension Regulations, 2003, published in SI 257 of 2003 are amended in section 9 BB as follows- in subsection 2 by the deletion of the words 1stJanuary 2023 to 21stJanuary 2024 and substitution with the words 1stJanuary 2025 to 21stJanuary 2026; approved beneficiary of power generation projects eligible for suspension of duty, read SI6 of 2025.\n\nThe development comes at a time when the Civil Society has castigated some Chrome miners for leaving behind a trail of destruction after tapping into the countrys underneath.\n\nZimbabwe is home to some 19% of global chrome ore reserves  the second largest in the world. Its chrome store is also of a higher grade than other international sources, with an exceptional chrome-to-iron ratio of 2:1.\n\n",

It is also not in dispute that the property they owned was in both their names and that it was sold for US$65,000.00.\n\nIn my view even if the court accepts that they were not in a business partnership, he cannot escape this obvious reality that she owned half of what they considered the marital home.\n\nBy registering the property in both names she obtained a half share.\n\nAlso, since there was no business partnership in the strict sense of that word relating to his cell phone business, the loan to Anita had nothing to do with the plaintiff.\n\nHe could not have used her half share of the proceeds from the sale of the property in which he owned half of it, to cover his own business loan.\n\nHe owes her US$32,500.00, ruled the judge before ordering Naison to pay the amount over a period of six months or such period as the parties may agree between themselves in writing.\n\nThe court heard the couple fell in love in 2013 and started living together the following year.\n\nKadiyo told the court that she gave birth to their first child in 2015 and stopped going to work.\n\nParties agreed to start a joint venture, selling mobile phones, the court heard.\n\nKadiyo said she contributed US$500 to this effect.\n\nShe said they obtained a US$35,000 loan from one Anita based in China which they paid within a month.\n\nThe couple according to Kadiya would make around US$7,000 everyday from their sales.\n\nShe would occasionally go to the shops when her husband was away on business trips as she was saddled with the responsibility of looking after a young child.\n\nThey then bought a stand in Haydon Park and started building up to the roof level whentheydecided to sell the house.\n\nShe also testified that at the time of their separation in 2023, they had cell phone stock worth US$40,000.00.\n\nKadiya had claimed US$20,000.00 as her half share of that stock but she did not have proof to that effect.\n\nIn his evidence, Naison denied that they had a business partnership.\n\nHe denied that she had ever given him US$500.00 to order more stock.\n\nNaison said the plaintiff knew of his business as a wife but that this did not make her a business partner.\n\nHe however admitted that they had bought a stand, which had been put in both their names.\n\n",

            "content": "By James Muonwa\n\nTHE United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has ordered all recipients of its funds to cease operations forthwith in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe latest development follows newly-elected U.S. President Donald Trumps executive orders of reevaluating and realigning his countrys foreign aid.\n\nUSAID has long been a significant contributor to Zimbabwes development initiatives. In 2024 alone, USAIDs funding to Zimbabwe amounted to approximately US$360 million, supporting a wide array of programmes spanning health, agriculture, and governance sectors.\n\nIn a January 27, 2025 notice to grant recipients, Andrea M. Plucknett, USAID Zimbabwe supervisory agreement officer, said recipients of funds must immediately suspend activities.\n\nDear implementing Partner: Effective January 24, 2025, the Agreement Officer hereby issues an order for the recipient to immediately suspend performance under the agreement your organisation was awarded by USAID/Zimbabwe.\n\nThe recipient shall take all reasonable steps to minimize the incurrence of costs allocable to the agreement during the period of award suspension, wrote Plucknett.\n\nRELATED:\n\nMain grant recipients and sub-grantees were also instructed not to resume work under agreements entered into with USAID until there is communication to lift the suspension.\n\nThe recipient shall not resume work under this agreement until notification has been received in writing from the Agreement Officer that this award suspension has been cancelled, further wrote Plucknett.\n\nAlso, all diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) initiatives being undertaken in Zimbabwe have been stopped.\n\nAll DEIA activities under all ongoing awards are to cease immediately. In light of the above, please have your authorised representative certify that any DEIA-related activities have completely ceased.\n\nThe Trump administration has moved to stop the supply of lifesaving drugs for HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, as well as medical supplies for newborn babies, in countries supported by USAID around the globe.\n\nAccording to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), Trump administrations three executive orders targeting DEIA initiatives take a shock and awe approach that upends longstanding, bipartisan federal policy meant to open doors that had been unfairly closed.\n\nIn his first few days, Trump is undertaking a deliberate effort to obfuscate and weaponise civil rights laws that address discrimination and ensure everyone has a fair chance to compete, whether its for a job, a promotion, or an education.\n\nWith these actions, the administration is not only undoing decades of federal anti-discrimination policy, spanning Democratic and Republican presidential administrations alike but also marshalling federal enforcement agencies to bully both private and government entities into abandoning legal efforts to promote equity and remedy systemic discrimination.\n\nTrumps executive orders undermine obligations that firms doing business with the U.S. government and receiving billions in public dollars are held to the highest standards in remedying and preventing bias.\n\nACLU says for decades, federal policies have supported efforts to promote equal opportunity, enforced by administrations from both parties.\n\n",
