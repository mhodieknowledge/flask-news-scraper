The discussions are of a general nature, and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. This week we want to discuss public-private partnerships in Zimbabwe, what they are and whether they are a goodconsiderationin theinvestment area.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nAs the name suggests, it is a partnership between the government on behalf of its people and a private player in the development of a particular project. Potential projects capable of investment vary and may range from projects like dam construction, road and rail infrastructure development, power generation and so forth. The opportunities are vast.\n\nThe motivation for the government is to provide its people with the necessary infrastructure at an affordable cost, including in projects where charges are defrayed directly to the public, for example, toll fees, while the motivation of the private sector is to maximise profits.\n\nThese motivations are the underlying guide to the contract negotiation process.\n\nSo in short, a typical Public Private Partnership will have the private company designing, funding, constructing and even implementing the project while the government monitors compliance with the undertakings made in the contract and in some instances allows for concessions within its capacity, like tax incentives to assist in expediting project implementation.\n\nReporter:Are PPPs in Zimbabwe a good area for investment in light of the potential economic risks?\n\nVM: The first thing to consider is that Zimbabwe is a developing country. That being said, it follows that there is a lot of scope where private players can partner up with the government to deliver necessary infrastructure at a profit.\n\nThe issue of risk, which is critical in all negotiations with all governments around the world, can be mitigated by understanding our economic model and laws. Our law makes it a condition precedent before entering any public-private partnership that the company or private party intending to enter into a Public-Private Partnership must undertake a thorough feasibility study of the project.\n\nThis feasibility study will highlight all the potential risks that may emanate from the project and such risks are then allocated to the best party capable of managing or mitigating them in the partnership contract.\n\nReporter: Where will a person contemplating a PPP go in the government to get assistance?\n\nVM: The Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency (ZIDA) and specifically the Public Private Partnership Unit within the agency, is responsible for the examination and review of the project, including its risk allocation. For a project to proceed to implementation, it requires the approval of the PPP unit and the Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion.\n\nIn unsolicited projects, where for instance, a private player has land that can be utilized in PPP to unlock value, the first port of call will obviously be the local council or responsible ministry with a comprehensive proposal outlining its value to the state and corresponding implementation requirements, be it legal, financial or technical.\n\nShould the government body responsible be satisfied with the proposal, it will then refer it to the PPP unit for evaluation. If the PPP unit gives the go-ahead, then the government body can enter negotiations with the private party for a mutually beneficial operating contract.\n\nReporter: What are the main considerations when negotiating a PPP?\n\nVM: It is critical to understand that PPPs are not a one-size-fits-all. Each PPP will address unique issues in a manner appropriate for that particular transaction. The underlying motivation for the parties remaining, as I stated earlier, the government intends to provide infrastructure at the best cost, and the private player intends to maximise as much profit. It is always best to allocate a portion of the profit as a buffer against unforeseen events like an increase in costs, delays in the project, which also have cost consequences, technical defects etc.\n\nAnother key consideration will be the model of the PPP, whether a Build Transfer PPP, a Build Operate and Transfer, Build Lease and Transfer. The type of structure should be one most suited to address projects particular risks.\n\nThe private partner on the other hand, may also be interested in achieving as many fiscal benefits as possible, which may include duty exemptions on capital goods, investment allowances, tax breaks or special rates et cetera.\n\nSpecial attention should also be afforded to the general contract clauses, like your dispute resolution clauses. They should allow provision for negotiated settlements as a first step in this type of contract, then consider alternative methods when negotiation fails. Other key clauses are your step-in, force majeure, and termination clauses as read with the undertakings clauses.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima, we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

            "content": "By Humeyra Pamuk I Reuters\n\nU.S. President Donald Trumps administration is considering significantly expanding its travel restrictions by potentially banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable seen by Reuters.\n\nEarlier this month, the Republican president signed a proclamation that banned the entry of citizens from 12 countries, saying the move was needed to protect the United States against foreign terrorists and other national security threats.The directive was part of an immigration crackdown Trump launched this year at the start of his second term, which has included the deportation to El Salvador of hundreds of Venezuelans suspected of being gang members, as well as efforts to deny enrollments of some foreign students from U.S. universities and deport others.In an internal diplomatic cable signed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the State Department outlined a dozen concerns about the countries in question and sought corrective action.The Department has identified 36 countries of concern that might be recommended for full or partial suspension of entry if they do not meet established benchmarks and requirements within 60 days, the cable sent out over the weekend said.The cable was first reported by the Washington Post.Among the concerns the State Department raised was the lack of a competent or cooperative government by some of the countries mentioned to produce reliable identity documents, the cable said.Another was questionable security of that countrys passport.Some countries, the cable said, were not cooperative in facilitating the removal of its nationals from the United States who were ordered to be removed. Some countries were overstaying the U.S. visas their citizens were being granted.Other reasons for concern were the nationals of the country were involved in acts of terrorism in the United States, or antisemitic and anti-American activity.The cable noted that not all of these concerns pertained to every country listed.We are constantly reevaluating policies to ensure the safety of Americans and that foreign nationals follow our laws, a senior State Department official said, declining to comment on specific internal deliberations and communications.The Department of State is committed to protecting our nation and its citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process, the official said.The countries that could face a full or a partial ban if they do not address these concerns within the next 60 days are: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cote DIvoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, Ethiopia, Egypt, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Tonga, Tuvalu, Uganda, Vanuatu, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.That would be a significant expansion of the ban that came into effect earlier this month. The countries affected were Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.The entry of people from seven other countries  Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela  has also been partially restricted.During his first in office, Trump announced a ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations, a policy that went through several iterations before it was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk Editing by Bill Berkrot.\n\nEarlier this month, the Republican president signed a proclamation that banned the entry of citizens from 12 countries, saying the move was needed to protect the United States against foreign terrorists and other national security threats.\n\nThe directive was part of an immigration crackdown Trump launched this year at the start of his second term, which has included the deportation to El Salvador of hundreds of Venezuelans suspected of being gang members, as well as efforts to deny enrollments of some foreign students from U.S. universities and deport others.In an internal diplomatic cable signed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the State Department outlined a dozen concerns about the countries in question and sought corrective action.The Department has identified 36 countries of concern that might be recommended for full or partial suspension of entry if they do not meet established benchmarks and requirements within 60 days, the cable sent out over the weekend said.The cable was first reported by the Washington Post.Among the concerns the State Department raised was the lack of a competent or cooperative government by some of the countries mentioned to produce reliable identity documents, the cable said.Another was questionable security of that countrys passport.Some countries, the cable said, were not cooperative in facilitating the removal of its nationals from the United States who were ordered to be removed.

The Zimbabwe sprinting duo took the top two spots on the podium.\n\nTrailing the Zimbabweans was Garrett Kaalund of USC, who broke the 20-second barrier for the first time to claim third in 19.96 seconds.\n\nJust missing the podium was a name that may sound familiar to Big Blue Nation: Jordan Anthony.The former Kentucky wide receiver and sprinter, now competing for Arkansas, finished fourth in 20.01 seconds.\n\nThe dual-sport athlete has continued both his football and track careers with the Razorbacks since transferring in 2022.\n\nTMars McCallum, the early-season world leader from Tennessee, finished fifth in 20.16 seconds.\n\nUSCs Max Thomas followed in sixth with 20.23, Xavier Butler of Texas ran 20.39 to place seventh and Abdul-Rasheed Saminu of South Florida rounded out the heat in 20.55 seconds.\n\nAfter successfully sweeping the event in Nationals this year, he added 10 points to the team total.\n\nMakarawu helped Kentucky finish tied for eighth in the team standings with 22 total points.\n\nThe Harare native will now set his sights on the 2025 World Championships in Tokyo this September, where he will represent his native country alongside some of the NCAAs best to compete against the best athletes the sport has ever seen.\n\n",
