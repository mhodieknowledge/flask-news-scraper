The black majority was confined to communal lands and all but completely excluded from commercial farming.\n\nThis mirrored our own experience in South Africa.\n\nIt was, therefore, essential for both historical redress and food security, development and economic growth that the government embarked on ambitious reforms to facilitate the entry of black Zimbabweans into productive agriculture, including support to small-scale farmers, Ramaphosa said.\n\nHe also congratulated Zimbabwe for the measures being taken to revive the countrys agricultural sector through policy reforms, investment in irrigation and mechanisation, and empowering large and small-scale farmers.\n\nWe know that the agricultural sector has been heavily affected by the growing impacts of the changing climate.\n\nSevere drought has impacted crop yields in recent years.\n\nAdapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change are an imperative for all nations. Collaboration among countries is critical to the success of these efforts, added the South African President.\n\nHe said: Biosecurity is another area in which Zimbabwe and South Africa must step up cooperation.\n\nOutbreaks of foot and mouth disease, avian or bird flu, crop infections and others, call on us to pool our resources and strengthen our collaboration, including through our respective research institutions.\n\nThe SA President explained that technological trends in agriculture must be fully embraced to increase output and conserve resources.\n\nBy way of example, geo-spacial agriculture using earth observation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has started to feature in some sectors of agriculture in South Africa and Zimbabwe.\n\nSuch innovation will be key as we collectively build resilience in pursuit of food security, he stated.\n\nEven amidst these challenges, Ramaphosa said a constant feature at ZAS had been the commitment to use agriculture as a catalyst for economic growth, sustainable development and historical redress.\n\nThe hosting of this agriculture show resonates with the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme, which seeks to improve domestic production and marketing as well as the facilitation of regional trade in food staples.\n\nIt will also help to make our industries more competitive in the global trading market and to make use of the substantial opportunities of the African Continental Free Trade Area, he stated.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), agriculture accounts for between 60 and 80 percent of employment in the region.\n\nWe must, therefore, work towards a more enabling regulatory environment to further boost this sector.\n\nWe need increased investment in small and medium farming entities, particularly those owned and run by women and the youth.\n\nPresident (Emmerson) Mnangagwa and I recently attended the SADC Summit in Madagascar, where agricultural transformation in the region was a major point of discussion.\n\nI call on the private sectors in both Zimbabwe and South Africa to use this show to explore avenues for great collaboration that will result in more trade and investment across our borders.\n\nAgricultural cooperation is key to sustaining jobs.\n\nWe need investment in the provision of seeds, training, irrigation schemes, storage facilities and in agro-processing.\n\nThe development of road, rail and aviation infrastructure is a key catalyst to take agriculture to an even higher level, Ramaphosa added.\n\n",

I like to be biased towards the rural area where diaspora investment can come and partner with the Government in developing our rural areas. Everyone has a kumusha [home] that they came from. Everyone has roots; those people need the diaspora to play ball. It is not just about sending money for medication but also getting involved in the rural district councils, said Mupamhanga.\n\nThe forum brought together Zimbabweans based abroad and policymakers to explore investment opportunities. It was part of the two-day programme which concludes Saturday with an awards gala at the Manna Resorts.\n\nSpeaking at the same event, the UK Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Peter Vowles, said it was vital for Zimbabweans in the diaspora to plough back their experiences into local communities.\n\nMany Zimbabweans in the diaspora are building lives around the world, including in the UK. Many Zimbabweans in the UK dream or plan to return home, and as a British Ambassador, one of the great privileges is meeting British citizens with Zimbabwean heritage coming home. You are bringing back experiences, ideas, and energy that can shape Zimbabwes future, said Vowles.\n\n",
