months were suspended on condition she performs 420 hours of community service.Mutswatiwa pleaded guilty to forgery and fraud by presenting a fake Zimbabwe Schools Examinations Council (ZIMSEC) Ordinary Level certificate, in a foiled attempt to pursue a Bachelor of Dental Surgery degree in Ukraine.The court heard that the offender, who had passed only three subjects at O level, worked with accomplices to generate a forged certificate showing seven passes.The document was then fraudulently authenticated at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade to appear legitimate.The forged certificate was intended to meet admission requirements at a Ukrainian university, where she had already advanced to third year before the fraud was uncovered, said the state.Three co-accused,

More games are set to be played, the second half is just beginning and we just hope to improve.Currently Manica Diamonds sit on position 13 on the log with 20 points, twelve ahead of bottom-placed Kwekwe United.Meanwhile, rumour has it that Manica Diamonds are in talks with former Highlanders coach Kelvin Kaindu as a possible replacement for suspended Tapera.\n\nAll hope is not lost , the season is not over.
