            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nIN a grotesque tribute yesterday, President Emmerson Mnangagwa paid a solemn tribute to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the passing of former president Robert Mugabe, whom he ousted through a military-assisted operation in 2017.\n\nMugabe, Zimbabwes founding post-independence leader, died in Singapore on September 6, 2019, two years following his removal from office by Mnangagwa and his Lacoste faction, which fought a bitter succession battle against the Generation 40 faction fronted by wife Grace Mugabe, Saviour Kasukuwere, Walter Mzembi, Jonathan Moyo and Patrick Zhuwawo.In his commemorative message, Mnangagwa praised Mugabe as a freedom fighter par excellence, a veteran nationalist, and revered frontline Statesman.Today, the 6th September, 2025, His Excellency the President E.D. Mnangagwa, the Party and Government join the former First Family and the entire nation in commemorating the passing on of the late First Executive President of Zimbabwe, Cde Robert Gabriel Mugabe, said Mnangagwa.A freedom fighter par excellence, and veteran nationalist, the late Cde R.G. Mugabe, was a revered Frontline Statesman who fearlessly championed the political and economic emancipation of Southern Africa and continent of Africa.Born on February 21, 1924, Mugabe endured 11 years imprisonment at the hands of the settler colonial regime before emerging in 1975 to lead Zanu in a protracted war of independence from bases in Mozambique.Mugabe prosecuted the armed struggle, known as the Second Chimurenga/Umvukela, culminated in Zimbabwes independence in 1980.Mnangagwa described Mugabe as a true son of the soil and iconic liberation fighter, whose political astuteness shaped the First Republic.Among his landmark legacies, the Land Reform Programme redefined land ownership patterns, addressing historic injustices of colonial dispossession.His indigenisation and economic empowerment policies sought to restore dignity, self-belief, and resilience to Zimbabweans, even in the face of illegal sanctions, the 82-year-old Zanu PF leader said.Himself a beneficiary of Mugabes benevolence, Mnangagwa added that in the social sphere, Mugabe broadened access to education and healthcare for the once marginalised majority blacks.In recognition of this, Mnangagwa said, the Second Republic established a National Honours and Awards category in his name, dedicated to human capital development.Mnangagwa equated Mugabe to fallen continental giants such as Julius Nyerere, Jomo Kenyatta, Kenneth Kaunda, Samora Machel, Agostino Neto, Sam Nujoma, Joshua Nkomo, and Nelson Mandela.He was a fervent Pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to fighting apartheid, promoting African renaissance, and advancing the cause of the downtrodden across the world, Mnangagwa said.As we remember our late President, the Second Republic once again re-dedicates itself to preserving the legacy of Cde R.G. Mugabe by winding up the successful National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) and preparing NDS2 guided by the goal to have a society that is free, democratic and prosperous, which leaves no-one and no place behind through inclusive development, he added.Mnangagwa noted that his Zanu PF party and government commit to iconic Mugabes enduring mantra that Zimbabwe will never be a colony again.\n\nMugabe, Zimbabwes founding post-independence leader, died in Singapore on September 6, 2019, two years following his removal from office by Mnangagwa and his Lacoste faction, which fought a bitter succession battle against the Generation 40 faction fronted by wife Grace Mugabe, Saviour Kasukuwere, Walter Mzembi, Jonathan Moyo and Patrick Zhuwawo.\n\nIn his commemorative message, Mnangagwa praised Mugabe as a freedom fighter par excellence, a veteran nationalist, and revered frontline Statesman.Today, the 6th September, 2025, His Excellency the President E.D.

Failure to do so, the letter warned, leaves Samaritans Purse free to pursue criminal charges and civil action.The letter was copied to Zimbabwes National Prosecuting Authority, signalling possible legal escalation.Samaritans Purse, founded in 1970 and led by Franklin Graham, son of the late evangelist Billy Graham, operates worldwide delivering humanitarian aid, disaster relief, and faith-based outreach.\n\nIn a letter seen by this publication, Harare law firm Mtetwa & Nyambirai, acting on behalf of Samaritans Purse, warned Chido Madosi to immediately stop fraudulent misrepresentation of authority to act on behalf of the organisation.\n\nOur client has no presence in Zimbabwe and has not authorised you, or any person in Zimbabwe, to hold yourself out as a director or other representative of the organisation, wrote lawyer Doug Coltart.The charity, which is legally registered in the United States as a 501(c)(3) non-profit, said it was alarmed by reports that Madosi was presenting herself under various titles, including Country Disciple of Samaritan Purse based in the USA, Founder and Director, and Managing Director of an entity she called Samaritan Purse.According to the letter, she even initiated litigation and entered into contracts under the disputed name  actions that create or are likely to create the false impression of affiliation with the globally recognised aid organisation.The charity accused Madosis actions of amounting to criminal and civil wrongdoing, including fraud, passing off, and intellectual property violations.By misrepresenting yourself as being affiliated with our client, you are engaging in conduct that in our view could amount to fraudulent misrepresentation and violations of intellectual property rights and the reputation of our client internationally, the letter stated.The legal team demanded that she immediately cease and desist from using the charitys name, logo, or any variation such as Samaritan Purse, warning that soliciting funds or services under the name was a serious offence.Within seven days, Madosi must confirm in writing that she has complied.
