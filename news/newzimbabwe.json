The country is also safe and friendly.\n\nAnd a third agreed: Zimbabwe is beautiful, the lifestyle is unmatched.\n\nI grew up in Zimbabwe and also had the best childhood, someone else wrote.\n\n",

The victim later died from severe head injuries.Justice Evangelista Kabasa, sitting in Hwange, dismissed Moyos claims of provocation, describing the attack as deliberate and fuelled by revenge.Seeking revenge is a completely different story and has nothing in common with acting in the heat of the moment, she said.Whether the intention was actual or legal is neither here nor there. Murder is murder.The court heard how Moyo pursued the deceased until he caught up with him, struck him with a stone, repeatedly kicked him, and then used an axe that caused fatal injuries.Why would one use an axe on a human being and not expect that person to be fatally wounded?

It is saddening to note the number of murder cases involving gold panners.

Mawuka succumbed to his injuries the following day in hospital.\n\nThe court dismissed Mpofus defences of provocation and self-defence as highly improbable and bordered on falsehoods.\n\nMzawazi noted that all the falsehoods in the accuseds story cumulatively expose his guilt Both defences of provocation and self-defence are unsustainable and outrightly rejected.\n\nOn sentencing, the judge noted the need for deterrence.\n\nThe degree of blameworthiness is on the higher side given that a dangerous weapon was used with fatal consequences. A clear message must be sent that killings over trivialities must be stopped. Life is valuable.\n\nMpofu was sentenced to 12 years for murder and three years for culpable homicide, but the terms will run concurrently, meaning he will serve 12 years in total.\n\nThe court acknowledged his troubled upbringing and exposure to artisanal mining violence but insisted justice must balance mercy with public confidence.\n\nA deterrent sentence is necessary, so as not to shake societal confidence in the criminal justice system and to warn others of the consequences of taking the law into their own hands.\n\n",

Their whole conduct showed that they were aware of their unlawful possession.The court said the argument that they were within the 15-day window under section 77 of the Parks and Wildlife Regulations was misplaced because the provision only applies to lawfully acquired ivory.Ignorance of the law is no defence. The belief held by the appellants was not sufficient to cover their conduct with legality, the judgment stated.The judges further noted that the duos decision to travel from Lupane to Bulawayo under the cover of night and Sibandas attempt to run away from police undermined their story.If their possession was lawful, they would have behaved in a completely different way, the court said, adding that the claim of expecting a reward was not reasonably true as the offices concerned do not give out rewards.\n\nThe court ruled that their defence of intending to surrender the tusks was meritless and legally unsustainable.\n\nJustices Rita Makarau Guvava, Susan Makoni, and Felistas Chatukuta recently dismissed the appeal by Hlupani Austin Sibanda and Ellmone Nkomo, who were earlier sentenced by a Bulawayo magistrate to 11 years and 9 years imprisonment respectively for contravening section 82(1) of the Parks and Wildlife (General) Regulations.The pair was arrested in April 2024 carrying a 21.75-kilogram sack of unmarked ivory pieces.According to the court record, Sibanda attempted to flee and only stopped when detectives from the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) Minerals, Flora and Fauna Unit fired a warning shot.In their defence, the men claimed they had picked up the tusks in Lupane while herding cattle and were on their way to surrender them to Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife offices in Bulawayo for a reward.They argued that the law gave them a 15-day grace period to hand over the ivory.But the Supreme Court found their explanation implausible.The appellants did not acquire the ivory lawfully and in turn could not lawfully possess it for registration purposes.

We hope that will remain the case in the future, which is why, as we discuss increasing volumes, we have chosen to walk together with them to reach our goal of 500 million kilograms, said Masuka.While about 10 percent of Zimbabwes tobacco leaf is currently processed locally, less than one percent is made into cigarettes, a market segment Zimbabwe now seeks to enter, Masuka said.Through collaboration with China, Zimbabwe aims to ensure that the bulk of its tobacco is processed locally to create jobs, boost export earnings and strengthen the countrys industrial base, he said.Masuka added that Zimbabwe could also benefit from acquiring advanced cigarette manufacturing equipment from China to further enhance value addition and beneficiation.Patrick Devenish, chairman of the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board, said China has long been a pillar of Zimbabwes tobacco trade. He said that Zimbabwe now seeks to explore the vast Chinese market by exporting locally manufactured cigarettes to one of the worlds largest cigarette consumer markets.Cigarettes are all about branding and finding markets for those brands. The biggest market for cigarettes in the world is China. So, if we can work with China to produce more of their cigarettes, that will be better for us, and hopefully for them too, Devenish said.China has the technology, capital and experience, while Zimbabwe has raw materials, skilled farmers, land and policy support for quality tobacco production. Together, the two countries can establish joint ventures in cigarette manufacturing, nicotine extraction, shisha production and alternative tobacco product processing, he said.Devenish also noted that Zimbabwes value addition drive faces challenges, including limited access to affordable long-term financing, underutilized factory capacity and outdated equipment. Collaboration with Chinese partners, he said, could help bridge those gaps.Celani Sithole, sales and marketing manager at the Tobacco Sales Floor, one of Zimbabwes leading tobacco auction platforms, expressed optimism about increasing partnerships with China.I am looking forward to seeing more Chinese businesses participating on our tobacco platform, Sithole said.\n\nMinister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Anxious Masuka made the remarks Thursday on the sidelines of the Zimbabwe-China Tobacco Expo, which opened the same day in Harare, the countrys capital.\n\nThe two-day event brought together Zimbabwean, Chinese and other global industry stakeholders to discuss ways to enhance tobacco production, processing and value addition.Masuka said that after achieving a record tobacco output of 355 million kilograms this year, Zimbabwe now aims to process 100 million kilograms of the locally produced crop through partnerships with China.China is the biggest export market for Zimbabwean tobacco.
