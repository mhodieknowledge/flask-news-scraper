Mnangagwa, has since declared a State of Disaster and directed the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works through the Department of Civil Protection to provide state-assisted burials as well as payment of medical bills for the injured following the DNC Coach road accident in Makhado, Limpopo Province, South Africa.\n\nMeanwhile, next of kin are in the process of identifying the bodies of their loved ones to facilitate repatriation.\n\nIn this regard, the Ministry of Local Government and Public Works in collaboration with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Trade and other Government entities, are calling upon relatives of the deceased to come forward and assist in the identification process, said Garwe.\n\nHe added that buses will depart from the National Disaster Management Centre at Makombe Building in Harare on 15 October 2025 at 12:00 p.m. to transport the next of kin to South Africa.\n\nThe repatriation process will commence after positive identification of the deceased.

In the same stride, we wish speedy recovery to the injured, Garwe said.\n\nThe tragic crash occurred around 6 p.m. on Sunday along the N1 North near Ingwe Lodge after the bus veered off the road and plunged down an embankment, killing 43 passengers and injuring several others.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has thrown out a bid by two Harare men accused of defrauding a woman of her US$250,000 house under the guise of a US$30,000 loan, ruling that their ongoing fraud trial must continue because there was a case to answer.\n\nJustice Joel Mambara last week dismissed an application for review filed by Leon Zvarevashe and Nyasha Mhuru, who had sought to overturn a magistrate Ethel Chicheras decision refusing to acquit them at the close of the States case.\n\nThe pair argued that the trial court had grossly misdirected itself by placing them on their defence despite what they called a complete lack of evidence.\n\nBut Justice Joel Mambara found that although the magistrate had misstated the legal test by saying a discharge is granted only in exceptional cases, the ruling itself was sound.\n\nStrictly speaking, the magistrate did err in suggesting that a discharge is granted only in exceptional circumstances, the judge said. However, her conclusion aligned with the substance of the law; there was a case to answer.\n\nZvarevashe and Mhuru are on trial for allegedly tricking complainant Debra Mullin into signing away her Hillside house in Harare, worth about US$250,000, when she believed she was signing a loan agreement.\n\nCourt papers show that in February 2023, Mullin and her daughter approached the two men seeking a US$30,000 loan. They were made to sign documents they thought related to the loan, only to later discover it was in fact an agreement of sale transferring ownership of the property.\n\nThe State alleges the pair unlawfully and intentionally misrepresented the true nature of the documents, causing potential prejudice of US$250,000.\n\nAt the close of the prosecutions case, the defence sought an acquittal, arguing that there was no proof of fraudulent intent and that the complainant had voluntarily signed the agreement. The magistrate dismissed the application, prompting the accused to approach the High Court seeking to halt the trial.\n\nIn his judgment, Mambara ruled that the magistrates decision did not amount to a gross irregularity warranting High Court intervention before the trial concludes.\n\nThe core allegation is that the complainant was deceived about what she was signing. On this point, the complainant testified unequivocally that she believed she was signing a loan agreement, not a sale, he said.\n\nIf a court believes that testimony, then a misrepresentation is established. There was evidence linking the applicants to the alleged fraud.\n\nThe judge said the complainants testimony, the signed documents, and evidence of partial repayments all pointed to a transaction that could reasonably be found to be a sham.\n\nHe said that mid-trial interference by the High Court is reserved for the rarest of cases.\n\nThis Court will not short-circuit the normal trial and appellate process absent a truly compelling reason, Mambara J stated. The magistrates decision was one a reasonable court could reach in light of the evidence.\n\nMambara concluded that there was no gross irregularity or injustice in the lower courts handling of the matter.\n\nThe alleged misdirection in articulating the test for discharge, while noted, did not result in any substantial miscarriage of justice, he ruled. The trial must proceed to completion, and the applicants remedies, if any, lie in the normal course of trial and appeal.\n\nThe application for review was accordingly dismissed, paving the way for Zvarevashe and Mhuru to either testify or exercise their right to silence when the defence hearing resumes.\n\n",

The announcement occurred just days after the Nobel Committee in Oslo announced that Venezuelan opposition leaderMaria Corina Machadohad won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for fighting dictatorship in the South American country.\n\nThe embassy closures with the two US allies also followed weeks of escalating tensions between Caracas and Washington.\n\nVenezuela has called on the UN for support over several deadly US military strikes on vessels off its Caribbean coast, which Washington alleges were carrying drugs.\n\nSome US allies on the UN Security Council called for de-escalation and dialogue.\n\nVenezuela has said it is in a situation where it is rational to expect an armed attack against the country in the short term, and Maduro has alleged the US is seeking a change in government.\n\nWashington has not responded to this accusation but has called Venezuelas socialist leader the illegitimate head of a narco-state. The US has also announced a new counter-narcotics task force in its Southern Command, a military branch that oversees Latin America.\n\nThe governments of Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso are more aligned with that of Russia, which has supported Venezuela at the UN and accused the US of acting according to the cowboy principle of shoot first.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFormer Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) leader Nelson Chamisa said he will not participate in the 17 October planned protests against President Emmerson Mnangagwas government.\n\nThis decision, he explains, stems from the oppositions experience with the November 2017 military takeover. He says their involvement then served as a salutary lesson, teaching them not to become entangled in Zanu-PFs internal factional and succession battles.\n\nThis follows a call from ousted Zanu-PF Central Committee member Blessed Runesu Geza for a one-million-man march on Friday, aimed at protesting against Mnangagwa and his alleged corrupt cartel. Gezas accusations target a number of high-profile figures, including controversial business tycoons such as Wicknell Chivayo, Geo Pomona CEO Delish Nguwaya, Paul Tungwarara, and Kudakwashe Tagwirei.\n\nHowever, analysts suggest that the planned protest goes beyond mere accusations of corruption but points to a deeper succession war playing out between Mnangagwas faction and his deputy, Rtd General Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nChiwenga is the favourite to take over from Mnangagwa, with many believing he has been patiently waiting for his turn. Yet, his path is reportedly being obstructed by Mnangagwa loyalists, who are now calling for the incumbent to extend his term of office beyond the constitutional limit of two terms.\n\nThis echoes the experience of the opposition previously, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), as it was then known, which took to the streets in a protest that ousted former President Robert Mugabe from power, anticipating a role in a new government.\n\nThat hope proved to be short-lived. The MDC felt betrayed and used, having been abandoned by Zanu-PF and Mnangagwa himself shortly after Mugabes departure.\n\nResponding directly to calls for him and his supporters to join Fridays protests in Harare, Chamisa wrote, 2017 taught us a big lesson!.\n\nHe added that the root cause of the countrys problems lies in disputed elections, maintaining that until this issue is addressed, Zimbabwe will remain trapped in its socioeconomic and political challenges.\n\nIgnoring the 2023 stolen election is ignoring the root of our crisis. Anything that does not address the 2023 stolen election is a fraud and a waste of time. Corruption, capture, suffering  theyre symptoms of a disputed mandate and a contested government. Lets treat the cause, not the symptoms, Chamisa wrote on his X account Monday.\n\nChamisa still commands a considerable following among opposition supporters despite his resignation from the CCC in January 2024, which left the opposition in further disarray.\n\n",

The incident has reignited public debate over the conduct of some Chinese investors, with calls for government to review foreign operations after the Centre for Natural Resources Governance (CNRG) released a video exposing poor working and living conditions at a Chinese-run mine in Mashava.\n\nPrior to committing capital, undertake a comprehensive and thorough assessment of Zimbabwes political, economic, social, and legal landscape. Go beyond financial metrics to gain a good understanding of the local investment climate, business culture, community dynamics, and socio-cultural norms including traditions and customs, the embassy said.\n\nIt added: Scrutinise all project details, with a particular focus on identifying potential risks and avenues for resolving disputes, establishing robust risk management protocols from the outset. Avoid involvement in any ventures that might lead to controversies or disputes.\n\nThe embassy also called on investors to prioritise personal and asset security.\n\nImplement proactive security measures upon arrival. This includes engaging reputable professional security services, optimising physical safeguards, and developingthen regularly rehearsingcomprehensive contingency plans for possible emergencies.\n\nAmid growing criticism over some investors alleged disregard for due process, the embassy reminded its citizens to resolve disputes through legal channels and to observe firearm regulations.\n\nAdhere strictly to legal and regulatory frameworks. Compliance with Zimbabwean laws and regulations is the non-negotiable foundation of all operations.\n\nAll disputes must be resolved through proper legal channels. Proactively seek advice and assistance from qualified legal counsel. In the event of criminal incidents such as theft, burglary, or robbery, while ensuring your personal safety, your immediate priority is to report the incident to the local police without delay. Should the police be unreachable or unable to dispatch officers immediately, you should remain calm and composed, and try to avoid any direct confrontation.\n\nEnforce strict firearms control. The illegal possession of firearms is strictly prohibited. The storage and use of any legally authorised firearms must be managed with the highest level of control and in full compliance with relevant regulations.\n\nThe embassy further encouraged Chinese companies to foster goodwill through responsible community engagement and environmental stewardship.\n\nAct as a partner in Zimbabwes development. Wherever possible, engage with local communities respectfully and responsibly. Consistently uphold fair labour practices and demonstrate environmental stewardship in line with all relevant laws and regulations.\n\nCorporate Social Responsibility initiatives are strongly encouraged as visible expressions of goodwill. Such proactive efforts foster mutual trust, strengthen community relations and affirm a shared commitment to Zimbabwes broader economic development and social progress.\n\nThe statement also emphasised that any grievances or threats to personal safety must be handled lawfully.\n\nIf faced with unfair treatment or rights infringement, remain calm and rational. Meticulously collect and preserve all relevant evidence. Your primary recourse is always through the established legal framework, supported by professional legal representation.\n\nIn the face of smears or disinformation, a proactive and strategic response is crucial. Engage legal counsel and seek assistance from relevant authorities to manage the situation and protect your reputation and legitimate rights and interests.\n\nThe embassy reiterated that corruption and bribery are criminal offences both in Zimbabwe and China.\n\nUnder no circumstances should bribes be offered, accepted, or solicited. If you encounter any form of corruption, including solicitation, extortion, or abuse of power, report it promptly to the Zimbabwe Republic Police and/or Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission.\n\nIn light of growing reports of labour and human rights abuses involving some Chinese-run enterprises, the embassy urged all companies to register with it after obtaining licences from relevant Zimbabwean authorities.\n\nThis, it said, would enable the embassy to provide timely consular protection and assistance when required.\n\n",

Thats being reflected in stronger company results, a 45% rise in the dollar-based Victoria Falls stock exchange and a property boom.\n\nIts also helping the ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, which was launched in April 2024 and marked the sixth effort to establish a viable local currency after high inflation and collapsing foreign-exchange values scuppered previous attempts.\n\nIt has only weakened by 3% against the dollar this year amid tight monetary policy, a far cry from the collapses suffered by its predecessors.\n\nStill, the Harare-based asset manager warned that fragility remains with the nations unsustainable debt levels a threat.
