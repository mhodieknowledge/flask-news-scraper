            "content": " As environmental, social impact comes under spotlight\n\nBy Tichaona Zindoga\n\nA local environmental consultancy firm, SustiGlobal, has set a major milestone after clocking over US$6 billion worth of investment and infrastructure projects in its first decade in business.\n\nSustiGlobal, whichintegratesenvironmental, engineering, and development consultancy,conducted environmental and social impact assessments (ESIA) in nearly 160 major projects in the country and the region.\n\nThe uptick of investments in recent years, especially with the proliferation of Chinese investments, has increased demand for ESIAs as a key pillar for sustainability. In Zimbabwe, the Environmental Management Agency approves ESIAs for projects with significant environmental (natural or biophysical) andsocial impacts, which is a legal requirement under the Environmental Management Act.\n\nSustiGlobal founder and chairman Oliver Mutasa\n\nSince inception, we have exponentially grown to be a significant player in the sustainability consultancy industry by being clients best choice, saysSustiGlobalfounder and chairman, Oliver Mutasa.\n\nBeing a multi-faceted advisory company, we pride in our vast hands-on experience in offering environmental management, occupational health safety, quality management, baseline surveys, and GIS services that are designed tosurpass international standards and environmental capacity building of various communities and stakeholders, Mutasa says.\n\nThe firm has undertaken ESIA for 155 projects wortha cumulativeUSD 6,7 billionaccording to Mutasa. These include:\n\nWorking with Communities\n\nLocal communities are key in the undertaking of ESIAs, as they are the ones impacted by projects, some of whom leave negative footprint scarring the environment forever.\n\nSustiGlobalconsulting teams are in communities courtersy of projects that theywill be working on, they use the opportunity to fully disclose to the same stakeholders about the project in question and use the same project to train the same communities and stakeholders about their environmental rights as premised in Section 73 of theConstitution of Zimbabwe (2013), which deals with Environmental Rights which are;Right to a Safe and Healthy Environment,Duty to Protect the Environmentand States Responsibility to make laws. These trainings empower communities to hold their developers (investors) and government agencies to account and any behaviour that may affect the same communities.\n\nOver the decade, in the 155 projects thatSustiGlobal has done, about 155 communities that translate to 4,650 people have been trained in theircommunities on impacts of development on environment.The same training would equip the communities to be knowledgeable about what they should demand from future investors who may come to them.\n\nConcurrently, SustiGlobal has undertaken Social Upliftment Programmes in communities through donation of soccer and netball ballsand distribution of sanitary pads in underprivileged ruralcommunitiessorely and in partnership with other organizations. The company alsopayfees for orphans and the vulnerable children in the communities,reflecting the deep philanthropic values of the founder, who is a devout Christian and community builder and change maker.\n\nCapacity\n\nSustiGlobal partly ownsSusti Global Africa (in South Africa) as a subsidiary, in charge of projects in South Africa.To broaden its capacity, the company has partnered consulting firms in Canada, Ethiopia, Egypt, Zambia, Mozambique and South Africa in a number of projects and that is expected to continue into Europe as the company is ushered into the second decade.\n\nAs part of diversification strategy since 2022, the company has entered into civil and structural engineering space in itsdesire to contributeto thebrick-by-brickbuilding of this countryand the global south region. This strategic direction is driven by a desire toaddgoods to the services that the firm has already been offering to the market, the firm says.\n\nMutasa looks back at the past decade, noting that the company has played its part in contributing positively to Zimbabwe.\n\nWe are deeply honored to have reached this important milestone as we continue contributing to national development in our professional capacity, he said.\n\nThe journey has certainly not beeneasy,particularly given the challenging economic environment our nation has faced.\n\nHowever, through resilience and invaluable support from the government, we have persevered and achieved significant progress. As weenter our second decade in this business, we look forward to continued collaboration and support from stakeholders both locally and internationally.\n\n",

Instrument (SI) 87 of 2025, which was gazetted by Industry and Commerce Minister Mangaliso Ndhlovu last month.The SI imposed a statutory payment into the Agriculture Revolving Fund on all millers, a move that they warned could result in negative inflationary pressures.Recommendations to set it aside were ignored.Failure to do so, as a result, is set to hike bread prices by not less than 4% on the retailers side according to the National Bakers Association of Zimbabwe (NBAZ) and Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ).Maize meal, stock feed, and other related products are likely to see prices go up.The NBAZ wishes to reiterate that the sector does not have capacity to take any increases in input costs, without compromising business viability, reads a letter to Ndhlovu from NBAZ, dated October 24, 2025.Bread flour accounts for approximately 43% of the total bread production cost, if a 4% increase in bread flour is permitted, it will translate to a 2 cents increase per cost of producing a loaf, resulting in an increase in the wholesale price of bread effective on the day on which the flour price is increased.The communicated increase in flour price, compounded with the other input cost escalations will result in an overall 5 cents per loaf pass-through effect to the retailer, most likely taking the retail price of bread, above the US$1 psychological benchmark, effective 1 November 2025.Despite fuel price increases, shortages of electricity and haphazard distribution, bread prices have remained at generally a dollar across the country.Their price hike could have a ripple effect whose inflationary impact might bring back memories of the late 2000s when prices changed by the hour.GMAZ, which according to another letter in NewZimbabwe.coms possession conceded defeat upon failure to scrap the SI, has already communicated the increase to the government.Regrettably, we have failed to successfully lobby for this SI to be reversed and have no option but to comply with it, reads a letter sent to Ndhlovu dated 23 October and copied to Lands and Agriculture Minister Anxious Masuka, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube, the presidents office, and the NBAZ.Accordingly, guided by the Audit Opinion we sought, we will be making provisions of the statutory payment imposed in our costings.Therefore, the price of bread flour (and other types of flour)

This will allow families to find closure as they now have the opportunity to bury their loved ones.\n\nSouth Africas Department of Transport has previously confirmed that the crash was caused by a combination of speeding, mechanical failure, and overloading.\n\nA preliminary report into the crash revealed that the bus was overloaded by 23 passengers, half of its brakes were defective, and the driver was travelling at an unsafe speed along a steep, winding mountain pass.\n\nTransport Minister Barbara Creecy and her deputy, Mkhuleko Hlengwa, have officially received the report, which was compiled by the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC).\n\nAccording to the RTMC, a major contributing factor was the drivers excessive speed for the conditions along the mountain descent.\n\n",

In the horticulture sector, the areas of interest include blueberries, chilies, avocados, and macadamia nuts, said Midzi.He noted that with Chinas zero-tariff policy for African exports, Zimbabwe aims to further tap into the Chinese market for locally produced goods.Looking at the Chinese market, we are also aiming to promote leather products, especially exotic leather. We are also looking to promote arts and crafts from Zimbabwe, the horticultural products, and the processed foods, said Midzi.Zimbabwe is additionally seeking to export heritage-based and value-added products such as baobab wine, baobab powder, and essential oils derived from indigenous resources.We have got baobab seed oil, we have got Marula oil, which are new products that are being developed in Zimbabwe, which we are looking to promote, and we believe the Chinese market is the right market, whether for further value additions into cosmeceuticals or even just consumption by the Chinese market, he said.As Zimbabwe works to strengthen its horticulture sector, businesses in blueberry production will be represented at the expo, following the signing of a blueberry export protocol during President Emmerson Mnangagwas visit to China in September.The protocol is only fairly new, but we are hoping to generate interest so that we can get information on potential buyers in China of blueberries so that we can bring back that information to the Zimbabwean growers and promote blueberry exports to China, said Midzi, adding that Zimbabwe is also pursuing export protocols for additional horticultural products, including citrus and avocados.\n\nKupakwashe Midzi, client advisor in the export development department at ZimTrade, Zimbabwes trade promotion agency, said about 15 companies from sectors including construction, horticulture, minerals, arts and crafts, and essential oils will participate in the expo, slated for Nov. 5 in Shanghai.\n\nWhat we are expecting to benefit from CIIE is getting more business deals, generating business leads, and getting businesses or companies in China that are interested in not only buying products from Zimbabwe, but also investing in the production of the products locally, said Midzi in a recent interview with Xinhua.He said the CIIE has, over the years, served as a key platform to showcase Zimbabwean products and expand their visibility in the vast Chinese market.We are looking forward to gaining a lot of traction from the Chinese businesses as well as potential buyers in what Zimbabwe has to offer.
