Plural for the word is Zvigananda.\n\nThis is Obey Chimuka, the owner of Fossil Contracting. He has done so many projects and some people think his projects are my projectshis company is also behind the recent construction of the Mbare Musika Markethe is a Chigananda, said Tagwirei amid wild applause from the audience.\n\nChimuka, who is on the United Kingdom sanctions list, also owns Khaya Cement, formerly LaFarge.\n\nTagwirei, Chief Executive Officer of Sakunda Holdings, was at Masvingo Polytechnic College for the Leadership Success Series programme.\n\nThe utterances by Tagwirei, who doubles as Chairperson of the controversial Land Tenure Implementation Committee, did not sit well with Mnangagwas spokesperson George Charamba, who took to his shadowy X account Dhonzamusoro007 to register his disapproval.\n\nWrote Charamba, My message to Zimbabweans. We can never grow and develop when we give wealth-generating initiatives derogatory names!!!\n\nTitle is key to capitalism we live under. Simply, we must learn to play the game.
