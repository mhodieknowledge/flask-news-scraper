            "content": "IOL\n\nSouth Africa  The Free Market Foundation (FMF) has said that the Democratic Alliance (DA) had only one role to play regarding the new Expropriation Act, which is unconditional and unrelenting opposition, but with the formation of the GNU, FMF said the party has allowed itself to be ideologically co-opted and has betrayed liberals.\n\nMartin van Staden, Head of Policy at the FMF, said in a statement issued on Tuesday that the DA has charted a different course, skirting around the acts fundamental constitutional, economic, and moral deficiencies and focusing instead on some peripheral formalities.\n\nThis is a weak  and failed  attempt to show its constituency that it is still againstthe Expropriation Actwhile protecting its position in the government of national unity (GNU).\n\nLiberalisms value proposition is simple: individuals and communities  society  must chart their course. The state must secure society against coercion directed at people or their property. Beyond this, the state must be severely limited by constitutional law so it cannot utilise its incredible power to deprive society of civil liberty or property.\n\nSince the establishment of the Progressive Party in 1959, followed by the Progressive Reform Party, Progressive Federal Party, the Democratic Party, and finally the DA, the DA has been the foremost representative of this political ideology in SA. However, with the formation of the GNU, the party has allowed itself to be ideologically co-opted.\n\nVan Staden added that co-option does not always mean sharing the precise philosophical imperatives of the co-opted,arguing that the DA is not yet a Marxist-Leninist party such as the ANC.\n\nUS President Donald Trump, in his usual unrefined fashion, did SA an excellent service by speaking out in favour of property ownership. He pointed out that property confiscation is now law in SA, that a class of people in SA  property owners  is being badly mistreated, and that this amounts to a human rights violation. On all counts, like him or not, Trump is right.\n\nAnd yet the DA, among the regimes usual cheerleaders in the media and academia, felt compelled to condemn Trump for speaking the truth rather than condemn Parliament and President Cyril Ramaphosa for adopting the kinds of policies that have turned relatively prosperous societies such as Zimbabwe and Venezuela into humanitarian disasters and basket cases, he said.\n\nThe FMF said the DA has been advised repeatedly and in excruciating detail about the constitutional and constitutionalist errors in the Expropriation Act.\n\nTruthfully, this should have been the final red line for the GNU\n\nIt is a betrayal that liberals and those who understand the key role property rights play in safeguarding freedom and democracy and creating the conditions for prosperity should not soon forgive the party for.The DA was supposed to be part of the solution, not part of the problem, read the FMF statement.\n\nApproached for comment, the DA dismissed the FMF statement alleging the party has been co-opted by the ANC and betrayed its supporters on the Expropriation Act.\n\nThe partys national spokesperson, Karabo Khakhau, said she is unsure what informed the FMF statement before dismissing it as baseless.\n\nAnyone with their finger on the pulse of South African politics would know that the DA has submitted court papers challenging the Act.\n\nWe are fundamentally opposed to the Act, in principle, because it opens the door to potential abuse through expropriation without compensation, which threatens property rights. Section 12 of the Act is particularly problematic.\n\nOur legal advice is that the best chance of getting a straightforward victory is to tackle the patently unconstitutional process by which it was passed.\n\nKhakhau mentioned that even if the FMF had fundamental constitutional objections to a piece of legislation, the best court strategy would provide the best chance of victory.\n\n",

The Death Penalty Abolition Act [Chapter 9:26] outlawed the imposition of the Death Penalty.\n\nIt further placed a positive legal obligation on the Minister responsible for Justice, the Prosecutor General and the Commissioner General of Prisons to do everything within their respective competencies to ensure every prisoner under the sentence of death is brought before the High Court for resentencing, Mabiza told the gathering.\n\nMaxime Prevot, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs, European Affairs and Development Cooperation, speaking on behalf of the core group on the question of the death penalty (Belgium, Benin, Costa Rica, France, Mexico, Mongolia, Republic of Moldova, and Switzerland), hailed the recent decision of Zimbabwe to abolish the death penalty and encouraged other states to follow suit, or, pending its abolition, to impose a moratorium on its use.\n\nSwitzerland welcomed Mabizas presence at the Human Rights Council and congratulated Zimbabwe for the major step in the protection of human rights.\n\nThe High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Trk observed that 113 countries have abolished the death penalty completely.

He also did not provide details about when exactly the British firm had restarted its hunt.\n\nMH370s disappeared from radar shortly after taking off from Kuala Lumpur airport in March 2014. It was bound for Beijing, with 12 crew and 227 passengers on board. The plane has never been found, and the reason for its disappearance is unknown.\n\nWere very relieved and pleased that the search is resuming once again after such a long hiatus, Malaysian Grace Nathan, 36, who lost her mother on the doomed jet, told AFP.\n\nJaquita Gonzales, 62, wife of MH370 flight supervisor Patrick Gomes, said she hoped the resumption of the search would bring her family much-needed closure.\n\nWe just want to know where it is and what happened, she said. Memories come back like yesterday, its fresh in our heads.\n\nMarine tracking website Marinetraffic.comshowedthat the Ocean Infinity vessel was in the south Indian ocean as of 23 February.\n\nMalaysia agreed to resume the search in December 2024, with Ocean Infinity conducting the search on a no-find-no-fee basis. Lokesaidthe government would sign a contract for 18 months, in return for which Ocean Infinity would receive $70m if the wreckage was located and verified. The search would cover 15,000 sq km, Loke said.\n\nOn 8 March 2024, on the tenth anniversary of the disappearance, Australia offered the Malaysian government support for a renewed search. Eight Australians were on board the flight. But on Tuesday a spokesperson for the Australian Transport Safety Bureau said that Australian authorities were not involved in the renewed search.\n\nFlight MH370, a B777-200 aircraft, departed Kuala Lumpur at 12.41am local time on 8 March 2-14, bound for Beijing. The plane was last seen on military radar at 2.14am, heading west over the strait of Malacca. Half an hour later, the airlineannounced it had lost contact with the plane, which was due to land at its destination about 6.30am.\n\nThe families of those on board are still waiting for answers about what happened to their loved ones. Sometravelled to Madagascar in 2016to comb the beaches there for debris: pieces of the planehad been foundoff the Tanzanian and Mozambican coasts.\n\nIn January 2017, after nearly three years of searching 120,000 sq km in the southern Indian Ocean, Australian authoritiesended the underwater huntfor the wreckage. On 3 October that year, Australian investigators delivered their final report on the disappearance, saying the inability to bring closure for victims families was a great tragedy and almost inconceivable in the modern age.\n\nAmong the questions that remain is why the plane made a seemingly controlled turn off course towards the Indian ocean and, critically, why two pieces of key communication and tracking equipment on the plane went silent.\n\nTheories of what happened haveranged from a pilot gone rogue to sabotageand conspiracies that the flight was shot down or disappeared by a nefarious government agency and landed at a dark site, either because of sensitive cargo or a politically significant passenger.\n\nData recovered from a home-built flight simulator owned by the pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah,showed that someone had plotted a course to the southern Indian Ocean.\n\nOcean Infinity, based in Britain and the United States, carried out an unsuccessful hunt in 2018.\n\n",

            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nZimbabwe could clear its arrears and rework $21 billion in debt thats kept it locked out of international capital markets for more than a quarter of a century if it implements fiscal reforms, the World Bank said.\n\nBy adopting a bold set of fiscal reforms, it can turn the page on a prolonged history of macroeconomic instability, and set the foundations for a credible national budget that is efficient, able to manage unforeseen fiscal risks, and can ensure a stable and competitive currency, the World Bank said in its review of Zimbabwes public finances on Wednesday. In turn, this would open up the historic possibility of arrears clearance and debt resolution, which would release major additional resources in concessional multilateral financing for public and private investments.\n\nIt would also put Zimbabwe on a high-growth path and a more stable macroeconomic trajectory, the Washington-based lender said.\n\nThe southern African nation defaulted on debt from lenders such as the World Bank, the Paris Club and the African Development Bank in 1999. In the past three years, its made concerted efforts to exit default. Its enlisted AfDB President Akinwumi Adesina and former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano to negotiate with creditors, hired Global Sovereign Advisory, a Paris-based consultancy, and started paying reparations to farmers and nations whose land it seized in the 2000s.\n\nChanges the World Bank recommends include removing monetary and exchange-rate distortions to enable low and stable inflation, reducing the public-service wage bill by eliminating duplicate and redundant roles and doing away with value-added tax exemptions and zero-rating to increase revenues.\n\nThe nation introduced the ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, in April last year to eventually replace the dollar in local transactions. Multiple previous attempts at creating a local unit have failed and led to spiralling inflation.\n\nThe central bank has introduced a plethora of steps to support the ZiG including curbing the money supply and forcing companies to price their products in the local currency, favouring the informal sector that sells goods at the higher unofficial exchange rate.\n\nThe World Bank also urged Zimbabwe to reverse the trend toward informalization by removing macroeconomic obstacles, high compliance burden for small businesses and taxing formal transactions.\n\n",
