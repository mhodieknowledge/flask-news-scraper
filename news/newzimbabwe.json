            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nFORMER cabinet ministers Saviour Kasukuwere and Tendai Biti have pushed back against controversial businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei, describing him as the face of corruption whose rise to power will be dire for Zimbabwe.\n\nThis comes after Tagwirei launched attacks on former ZANU-PF political commissar Kasukuwere and Biti, accusing them of corruption.\n\nBiti has previously challenged Tagwireis Command Agriculture contracts when he was still a legislator.\n\nConsequently, in 2020, Tagwirei was sanctioned by the United States of America for allegedly aiding government corruption through state contracts secured by his company, Sakunda Holdings.\n\nPosting on X, Kasukuwere said Tagwireis ascent to power within ZANU-PF would betray the revolutionary partys ethos.\n\nA good fraudster is not necessarily a good politician. Trying to turn a thief into a leader is the ultimate betrayal of the revolutionary party by a reactionary leader. The game has begun, and that rimming mouth will not be opened again.\n\nWhen a frog wakes up in ZANU-PFs Central Committee, it thinks all other positions are acquired by leaping! A historic party has been reduced to a rent-seeking, positions-for-sale party. How does a whole NPC [National Political Commissar] Machacha subordinate himself to a crook? Hurombo Huroyi, wrote Kasukuwere.\n\nBusinessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei(Photo credit JEKESAI NJIKIZANA/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTagwirei, a close ally of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, is reportedly eyeing the ZANU PF leadership when Mnangagwas constitutional term expires in 2028.\n\nThe businessman has been criss-crossing the country, hosting ZANU PF events, a move political observers describe as an attempt to galvanise support within the ruling party.\n\nHe has denied ambitions to succeed Mnangagwa, instead pushing for the presidents term to be extended beyond the constitutional two-term limit.\n\nBiti, who has been vocal against Tagwireis potential rise to power, said an audit should be conducted to trace funds the businessman allegedly gained through opaque government contracts.\n\nWe stand firm on principle & on deep-rooted values that have defined us for decades. We will never allow charlatans & crooks to take over the State, to emasculate the Constitution, or to buy their way into office. Criminals must know that one day soon, Zimbabwe will rise, and crooks will fall.\n\nA New Zimbabwe must audit all Treasury Bills issued by the Government in the last 20 years. Billions have been illicitly siphoned off in opaque transactions done outside parliamentary scrutiny. One crook has been awarded more TBs than any other entity in Zimbabwe. Its time for this audit! said Biti.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) has said the lack of funding to manage elephants in its game reserves is negatively impacting elephant conservation efforts, leading to increased human-wildlife conflict.\n\nThe authority is working with a budget of US$500,000 at its biggest game reserve, Hwange National Park, against the required US$21 million to manage the ever-increasing elephant population.\n\nZimParks recently hosted a review and updating workshop on the Zimbabwe Elephant Management Plan (2021-2025) to assess implementation of the plan, emerging issues, evaluate management approaches, and exploring effective strategies from past experiences which was for the first time attended by chiefs from Hwange.\n\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, ZimParks spokesperson Tinashe Farawo said chiefs complained that their affected communities have not benefited from their proximity to the wildlife.\n\nThe chiefs expressed their concerns on the lack of tangible benefits for communities who bear the brunt of sharing borders with elephants and a relief fund for injured community people.\n\nThe traditional leaders expressed concerns over the ongoing poverty faced by these communities, worsened by crop raiding, resource competition, and incidents of injury and property damage caused by elephants, he said.\n\nThe increased elephant populations and localised overabundance have resulted in increased human-elephant conflicts.\n\nAccording to Farawo, while this is happening, ZimParks efforts to curb the crisis are dampened by a lack of resources.\n\nThe countrys elephant conservation efforts are severely under-financed, with the current budget for Hwange National Park falling below US$500,000 annually, compared to the estimated US$21 million required based on management costs in other well-managed protected areas in Southern Africa, he said.\n\nFarawo also said sustainable utilisation is hindered by various factors, including global trade restrictions.\n\nMeanwhile, while elephant poaching for ivory has declined, effective partnerships have played a vital role in enhancing conservation efforts.\n\nFarawo said elephant conservation requires collective efforts from all stakeholders.\n\nZimbabwe has the second-largest elephant population in the world, with an estimated 82,000 elephants.\n\nWhile Zimbabwe is lauded for its conservation efforts, the elephant population is growing faster than the environment can sustain, leading to human-wildlife conflict and habitat degradation.\n\n",
