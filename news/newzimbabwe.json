I feel very strong. I feel very powerful that Im doing all this work. But Im doing all this work while Im creating a baby, me and my man, were very supportive of each other, she said.\n\nCardi B said she and Diggs share the same ambition, each determined to be the greatest in their fields. She also credited Diggs with giving her a sense of stability as she readies her next album, Am I The Drama?, which includes a track called Safe.\n\nAnd he just makes me feel safe and very confident and very strong, she said. I mean, like, two weeks ago I was literally having a panic attack. I was, like, crying and crying and crying, just because I was just getting really nervous with you know, the whole album rollout  People were coming at me very hard. You know, sometimes people love you, people hate you. And people was just saying very mean things about me.\n\nShe admitted harsh criticism sometimes makes her question releasing music.\n\nAnd Im like, see, this is why I dont put music out, because its like, this is my art and this is something that I put a lotta love and time to. And its just like, sometimes, when people just rip it apart it just hurts you and it crushes you, she said.\n\nThrough it all, Cardi B  whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis Almnzar  said Diggs support keeps her steady.\n\nHe makes me feel very confident And it makes you feel like you could take over the world.\n\nShe added that she waited to announce the pregnancy until she was able to close some deals first. She also admitted she has not yet told her parents, jokingly saying she is scared of them.\n\nCardi B, who shares three children with rapper Offset, said she was reluctant to fall in love again amid their high-profile divorce. But she recalled Diggs telling her: Let me heal you. Give me a chance for me to heal you.\n\nNow that pregnancy rumors are confirmed, Cardi B used her world-famous humor to ask fans to purchase her new album: Now yall could buy my album so I can buy Pampers and diapers and all that type of stuff. I told you. Now go support my album, cause Im a mother of four now.\n\nCardi B says her sophomore album feels complete.\n\nI feel like it touch every little thing that I want to touch. And I just feel like its something that is not out there right now.\n\n",

We further propose the immediate deportation of these foreign nationals, who are bad apples amongst us, said Tendai Pinduka, a ZANU PF MP.\n\nHarare magistrate Vakayi Chikwekwe ruled that the quantity of cocaine the nine Chinese nationals were in possession of was insignificant.\n\nThe leniency of the judgement has been widely criticised, with the Zimbabwean government accused of being too soft on the Chinese, with whom it maintains a strong relationship.\n\nBy comparison, being found in possession of drugs in China is met with far harsher punishment, in some cases, a death penalty.\n\nThe judgement has been viewed as a mere slap on the wrist and one that undermines the governments stance on fighting drug abuse in communities.\n\nSurprisingly, foreign nationals were recently found in possession of dangerous drugs and cocaine, arrested, and fined a paltry US$150, which in our view is not deterrent enough. It further undermines the authority of His Excellency the President, Dr E.D. Mnangagwa, in combating the menace and scourge of drugs and substance abuse, said Pinduka.\n\nChinese nationals have been accused of committing crimes and escaping harsh sentences by leveraging their all-weather friendship with Zimbabwe.\n\n",

Yet under the current law, numerous men have been imprisoned in circumstances where paternity was disputed or later disproved.\n\nBelieve Guta\n\nFounder of Big Brains Legal Aid Trust, Guta said the current system had caused irreparable harm, including loss of liberty, reputational damage, and psychological trauma.\n\nThere is no ministry responsible for men, yet we have one for Womens Affairs. The plight of men has been neglected. Many are suffering in silence, he told the committee.\n\nHe proposed the insertion of a new subsection to the Maintenance Act: No proceedings shall be instituted unless the paternity of the child has been established by voluntary acknowledgement, court declaration, or DNA testing where paternity is disputed.\n\nGuta further suggested that Parliament introduce a statutory review mechanism to reassess past cases where men were imprisoned without conclusive proof of paternity.\n\nCiting statistics, he said the African Institute of Bio-Medical Research found that 32% of maintenance-related disputes in 2019 revealed non-biological fathers, while Global DNAs data indicated up to 72% exclusion rates in tested cases\n\n",
