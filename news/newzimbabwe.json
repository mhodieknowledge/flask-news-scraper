            "content": "By BBC\n\nTHE trial of Diego Maradonas medical staff has collapsed in Argentina after it was found that a judge involved in the case had taken part in a documentary about it.\n\nThe judge in charge of the proceedings said the trial, which began on 11 March and was expected to last until July, would have to start again.Seven members of Maradonas medical team were charged with negligent homicide relating to the former footballers death in 2020. They deny the allegations.One of the three presiding judges, Julieta Makintach, stepped down this week.Maradona, a former Napoli and Argentina midfielder, had been recovering at his home in Buenos Aires from brain surgery for a blood clot in November 2020 when he died of a heart attack, aged 60.Among the medical team on trial are a neurosurgeon, a doctor and a night nurse. They claim the retired footballer refused further treatment and should have stayed at home for longer after his operation.If convicted, they face between eight and 25 years in prison.Earlier this week, Prosecutor Patricio Ferrari accused Makintach of behaving like an actress and not a judge after she took part in a documentary about the case.As a trailer for the documentary series, called Divine Justice, was played in court, defence lawyer Rodolfo Baque shouted trash! at Makintach.Maradonas daughter Gianinna and his former partner Veronica Ojeda both cried after seeing the footage.It is a violation of court rules for unauthorised filming to take place and the documentary was being filmed without the permission of the court.Following criticism for taking part in the show, Makintach said she had no choice but to excuse herself from the case.The trial was then adjourned pending the decision on Thursday, which ultimately was to declare a mistrial.Since beginning, the trial had heard the testimony of almost 50 witnesses, including Maradonas daughters.The date for the new trial was not initially set and new judges were not nominated.\n\nThe judge in charge of the proceedings said the trial, which began on 11 March and was expected to last until July, would have to start again.\n\nSeven members of Maradonas medical team were charged with negligent homicide relating to the former footballers death in 2020.

Sometime in April 2025, he got a job to operate as a pirate taxi driver and left his wife, Mercy Madenyika in charge of the store.\n\nOn April 25, 2025, around 1000 hours, Madenyikawas approached by a neighbor and five other unidentified male adults, who bought some groceries worth US$$10using a fake US$$50 note and were given some change before fleeing from the scene.\n\nMadenyika later discovered that she had been duped and alerted her husband, the now deceased, about the matter.\n\nJuruvenge then approached some of the people among the group which had bought groceries at his tuck-shop using fake money.\n\nAn altercation arose and the now deceased, assaulted one of the men once on the face using open hands. One of them only identified as Mwazha offered Juruvenge US$100 as compensation for the inconveniences and he accepted it and went away.\n\nMwazha later proceeded to ZRP Ruwa and made a report of assault and theft against the now deceased CR 185/04/25 refers, reads the memo.\n\nOn May 27, 2025, around 1130 hours, the accused person number 078641D Constable Prince Ndavambi and Mwazha proceeded to the now deceaseds place of residence and arrested the now deceased.\n\nThey took him to Ruwa Police Station together with his sister Melisa Manyepa of Damafalls, Phase 1 whom they accused of harbouring the now deceased, the memo further reads.\n\nOn arrival at the police station, Ndavambi detained the now deceased under DB 460/25 and force-marched his sister to the back of the cabin and assaulted her on the knees using a wooden stick.\n\nThe accused person later took the now deceased from cells to the cabin where he assaulted him all over the body using a wooden stick. He ordered the now deceased and his sister to refund Mwazha his US$100.\n\nThe accused person threatened to kill the now deceased if he fails to refund the money. He also demanded another US$100 from the now deceased and his sister so that he can release them, police said in the memo.\n\nThe constable only stopped flogging Juruvenge after noticing he had become unconscious.\n\nUnperturbed, Ndavambi is said to have ordered Manyepa to contact her relatives to bring the money. She contacted her mother Elipa Jimu and others, who could not raise the required money.\n\nAccording to the police internal communication, the rogue cop then instructed a battered Juruvenge to stand up from where he was lying so that he shunts him into cells, but victim could not move. The police officer them pulled now deceased into the cell.\n\nAssailant later released victims sister to go and find money and she proceeded home. That evening, the accused called Manyepa asking her to bring food for the now deceased and she indicated that that she could not walk due to her knee injury as a result of the earlier beating.\n\nOn the same date at around 2130 hours, a cell check was conducted by the duty member, and he observed that the now deceased had difficulties in talking and breathing.\n\nAn entry was endorsed in the Occurrence Book entry number 3917/25. Officer in Charge ZRP Ruwa was advised through telephone and instructed the duty member to take the now deceased to hospital under police guard.\n\nThe now deceased was taken to Ruwa Rehabilitation Centre for medical attention where he was admitted.\n\nOn 28 May 2025 around 0615 hours, the now deceased passed away at Ruwa Rehabilitation Centre, reads the memorandum.\n\nThe informant reported the matter at ZRP Ruwa. Scene was attended by ZRP Ruwa, CID Homicide and CID Studios. The deceaseds body was inspected and following observations were made:  small bruise on the left lower limb and bruises on the right hand.\n\nThe body of the now deceased was conveyed to Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals mortuary for forensic postmortem. Next of kin Manyepa was advised and identified the body. Investigations are in progress, the memo says.\n\nThe investigations are being done under ZRP Ruwa CR 379/5/25.\n\nAccording to the now deceaseds brother, Robson Juruvenge his family is devastated by the murder, which they feel someone is trying to cover up.\n\nAfter we contested the unconvincing results of the first postmortem results, we have been told another postmortem will be done on Monday.\n\nWe have been in talks with police Commissioner Mbiri of PGHQ (Police General Headquarters). Also, we have been summoned to Ruwa Police Station this Saturday, Robson told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nHe vowed the family will leave no stone unturned in a bid to unravel the truth surrounding his brothers gruesome killing at the hands of a rogue law enforcement officer.\n\n",

This was after his company, TN Asset Management, underwrote a rights issue for the company late last year.\n\nResponding on his X (formerly Twitter) recently, Nyambirai clarified that while he cannot speak on behalf of Steward Bank or EcoCash Holdings, he vowed to push for an official disclosure via the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE).\n\nA legal notice on the change of name of Steward Bank Limited has generated a lot of interest here on X.\n\nWe shall seek the authority of the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange to publish an update on the name changes. The update shall seek to answer some of the questions that have been raised, he said.\n\nA name looked at in the abstract might be meaningless. But the way the owner carries the name gives it value. Many Zimbabwean bank names lack obvious meanings, yet their strength lies in how they deliver on their promises.\n\nThe present generation would have demanded that Henry Wells and William Fargo change names first, before they named their banks, Wells Fargo after themselves, he said.\n\nThe rebranding process, he noted, will follow stringent corporate governance procedures, including shareholder consultations.\n\nMarket watchers believe that Nyambirais challenge remains convincing the public that the new identity will uphold or surpass the banks legacy.\n\n",
