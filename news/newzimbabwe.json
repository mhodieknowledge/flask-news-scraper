            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA 21-year-old security guard from Kadoma has avoided jail time following an accidental discharge of a firearm, which resulted in the death of a miner at Sengy Mine.\n\nThe state was insisting on a murder charge, but the High Court found Anthony Mutefara guilty of culpable homicide before sentencing him to three years in jail.\n\nTwelve months of his sentence were set aside for two on condition that he does not commit a similar offence.\n\nThe remaining 24 months were suspended on condition that Mutefara performs 820 hours of community service at Mkoba Clinic.\n\nThe unfortunate incident took place last year when he was 20.\n\nIt is a proven fact that Mutefara, a recently trained security guard, was only two days at the new job when he was deployed at Sengy Mine Post in Kadoma.\n\nHe was to relieve a colleague who was going off duty.\n\nThe deceased, in the company of his two co-miners, was whiling away time sitting by the security guard cabin post.\n\nAccording to the unchallenged testimony of the accused, he had just assumed duty and was inside the cabin when the deceased unnoticeably also entered the mini room.\n\nThe deceased had entered the cabin to collect his already charged phone and to charge another as per their custom.\n\nAn inverter had been placed inside the cabin, but behind the door, for the purpose of assisting the miners coming from the underground mining shafts to recharge their mobile phones.\n\nThe inverter was positioned approximately a meter adjacent to the bed, which was also situated therein.\n\nIt is soon after the deceaseds entrance into the said room that a startling sound was heard, leading the deceaseds colleagues to scamper away for safety.\n\nIt was only after the first witness, Peter Milton, regained composure and retraced his way back to the source of the explosive sound did he find the deceased lying face up with his head protruding from the door hanging unsuspended.\n\nAccording to this witnesss testimony upon entry into the cabin to enquire, he then saw the accused astonished and in shock, holding the gun.\n\nBoth the first witness and the accused placed the deceased in a better lying position outside the cabin, reads court papers.\n\nMutefara, who was visibly shaken, was seen using his own garment to try and stabilise excessive bleeding.\n\nIn his defence, Mutefara stated that he took safety precautionary measures as soon as he was handed the gun.\n\nHe placed the gun in a safety catch or mode.\n\nSince he had just learnt that there was a bullet jammed in the barrel, he emptied the gun.\n\nThe first bullet fell under the bed but the second remained lodged.\n\nIn his effort to retrieve the fallen bullet, he placed the gun on the bed whilst bending.\n\nHe hardly noticed the entrance or presence of the deceased until he heard a loud bang.\n\nAt first, he thought it came from outside, as was the norm with explosives at the mine. He then realised that the gun had discharged on its own accord when he saw the smoke on the mouth of the barrel, signalling recent gunfire.\n\nAt the same time, he observed the deceased, who was in a bent position, falling backwards.\n\nIn convicting him, the judge said the manner in which the events unfolded portrays mere carelessness rather than recklessness.\n\nThe accuseds action of taking safety precautionary measures in a confined space borders on negligence rather than out of realisation of risk or possibility that death may ensue out of his conduct of leaving an unsupervised semi-loaded gun for a short stint of time, noted the judge before convicting Mutefara.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA psychiatric patient who had previously served jailtimefor murder has killed two more victims following hisrelease.\n\nThe accused is Jealous Tomasi, a documented psychiatric patient, who was released into the public domain after a 12-year imprisonment at Chikurubis psychiatric unit.\n\nHe had been committed to the psychiatric ward after a special verdict on a murder he committed in 2008 whilst mentally incapacitated.\n\nTwo years after his release, whilst showing some normalcy, he committed two other murders and was brought before the High Court.\n\nThis time, he stands charged with two counts of murder in terms of s47 of the Criminal Code [Chapter 9:23].\n\nThe evidence adduced shows that the relapse was caused by a lack of consistency or his total neglect to take his prescribed medication.\n\nHowever, it is apparent that he had, to a certain extent, resumed normal life and had joined some artisanal mining syndicates.\n\nIt is alleged that on the 29th of September 2022, after the accused had retired to bed in the company of his girlfriend, an altercation arose from outside his make-shift cabin at the mining site.\n\nAccused awakened and was promptly and impulsively steered into action by uninvitedly joining in the fight.\n\nSomehow, he then snapped and axed one of the culprits, the court heard.\n\nAnother neighbour who was attracted to the scene by the commotion was also savagely axed to death.\n\nTomasi was arrested after he had fled the scene, giving rise to this criminal trial.\n\nHe has been held at the Chikurubi Psychiatric Unit since the 12th of July 2023, in terms of sections 27 and 28 of the Mental Health Act [Chapter 15:12].\n\nThe affidavit compiled by the psychiatric doctor, Dr. S. W. Mazorodze, who evaluated the accused on the 25th of February, 2025 chronicles his mental history and his current mental disposition.\n\nAgainst the background of the accuseds mental history and relapse, the case proceeded as a Stated Case.\n\nA statement of agreed facts was submitted.\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Catherine Bachi-Muzavazi, sitting with two assessors, quizzed Tomasi as to ascertain, assess and confirm whether he appreciated what was going on and was fit to stand trial.\n\nWe noted that he appeared mentally stable.\n\nThis is owed to the strict supervision by the prison psychiatric staff officers who ensured and superintended adherence to the prescribed drug regime, said Muzavazi.\n\nThe judge said what is apparent is that such supervision and assistance were lacking when the accused was initially certified fit for release from the mental institution the first time around.\n\nTwo more lives were lost because of that negligence.\n\nThere is no evidence that there are people willing to take care of him or supervise him, as can be deduced from the record of proceedings.\n\nAfter release, he mingled with artisanal miners and was freelancing as an artisanal miner.\n\nMuzavazi said in the circumstances of this case, the dilemma or predicament the court finds itself in is that there is a very recent report mentioned earlier on after the accused had undergone mental treatment and evaluation certifying his fitness to be released in the custody of one John Madzengerwa, his nephew.\n\nOn the other hand, though the accused does have some lucid moments or intervals, the commission of this offence shows that there is no guarantee that he will not once again turn into a serial killer.\n\nIt will be akin to releasing a loose cannon or a time bomb waiting to explode with dire consequences.\n\nHe is a danger not only to himself but to his community and the society at large.\n\nThat being the case, we strongly feel that mental evaluation and certification by a single expert, though respected, is not sufficient.\n\nThe accused needs to go under further management and treatment, she said.\n\nAccording to the court, the authorities mentioned in s29 of the Act must comply with the provisions of s29(4) to 29(7), speaking to the mandate to place the accused before a special board which will in turn place him before the Mental Health Review Tribunal.\n\nThe court ruled that until such time the accuseds mental state has been reviewed by the Mental Health Review Tribunal and appropriate recommendations have been made in terms of the stipulated procedures as dictated by the Mental Health Act, the accused is not to be released.\n\nAccused is accordingly ordered to be returned to prison for transfer to the Chikurubi Mental institution for further management as ordered above and as prescribed by Section 29 of the Mental Health Act, ruled Muzavazi.\n\n",
