            "content": "By UK Correspondent\n\nLONDON: It is difficult to put into words the depth of our loss, but even harder to fully capture the incredible life that he lived, said Duduzile Machipisa.\n\nAs a journalist, he was passionate about telling stories that needed to be told, Duduzile added in a touching tribute to her late father and former BBC reporter Lewis Machipisa.\n\nDuduzile Machipisa\n\nHis work at BBC Africa was more than a career; it was a calling. He believed in the truth, in justice and in giving a voice to the unheard.\n\nDozens of colleagues from the BBC, the UK-Zimbabwe media fraternity, as well as family and friends attended Machipisas funeral service and burial last Thursday at the Kemnal Park Cemetery & Memorial Gardens in London.\n\nUK-based global risk solutions provider,Diaspora Insurance, sponsored the live broadcasting of the funeral service.\n\nTributes from colleagues and friends captured the fascinating contrast between the seriousness of Machipisas impactful journalism and his humble, unassuming and happy-go character.\n\nIfhakuna matata (no worries) was a person, that was Lewis; just unbothered, explained long-time friend and colleague Innocent Chifamba Sithole.\n\nLewis lived authentically  no frills, just Lewis. He represented the lighter side of life. He was sunshine and what I mean by that is you wouldnt be talking to Lewis if you were not smiling and laughing.\n\nViolet Gonda, another contemporary of Machipisa added, Lewis was a very close friend; I used to call him MaChips.\n\nHe was just a fun-loving guy and I remember the last time I saw him was at the UK Zimbabwe Achievers Awards. He is the one who made the whole event so entertaining.\n\nHe wouldnt keep quiet and was just dancing throughout the evening; that was Lewis for you.\n\nLance Guma (right)\n\nNehanda Radios Lance Guma said, The guy (Lewis) was always making us laugh.\n\nI dont remember a single event I went to and did not leave with a sore set of ribs from the laughter. He was comedy gold; he knew how to make us laugh.\n\nWhile comedy defined how Machipisa related with family and friends, his journalism was anything but; it was serious, professional, impactful and inspirational.\n\nHopewell Chinono is another veteran journalist and long-time friend who attended the funeral. Chinono was in the same class at journalism school in Harare with Machipisa between 1991 and 1993.\n\nLewis was dedicated to his work to a point where he had to leave Zimbabwe and come into exile in the United Kingdom because he was being harassed by the then (Robert) Mugabe administration.\n\nChofamba Sithole added; He (Lewis) was an inspiration to me as a young journalist in Zimbabwe. I got to know him when he was already working with IPS and covering stories for global audiences.\n\nHe quickly followed that up with the BBC, reporting from hot spots such as South Sudan as it emerged to become Africas 54thindependent nation; Lewis was there to report and record that moment in history.\n\nHis voice is well known and beloved across the African continent which he reached out to through BBC World Service programmes such as Focus on Africa and Network Africa.\n\nHe (Lewis) was a pathfinder, concluded Professor Winston Mano of the University of Westminsters School of Media and Communication.\n\nHe introduced many of us to the BBC. A humble man and keen journalist but also somebody who was the soul of the party; always up for a good laugh.\n\nMachipisa, who was 53, passed on peacefully at his home in Catford, Southeast London, on Wednesday morning, January 8, 2025. He is survived by three children Dudu, Dumi, and Chikomborero.\n\n",

For malicious damage to property, he was sentenced to six years imprisonment, two of which were set aside.

            "content": "Reuters\n\nGum arabic, a vital ingredient used in everything from Coca-Cola to M&Ms sweets, is increasingly being trafficked from rebel-held areas of war-torn Sudan, traders and industry sources say, complicating Western companies efforts to insulate their supply chains from the conflict.\n\nSudan produces around 80% of the worlds gum arabic, a natural substance harvested from acacia trees thats widely used to mix, stabilize and thicken ingredients in mass-market products including LOreal lipsticks and Nestle petfood.\n\nThe paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), at war since April 2023 with Sudans national army, seized control late last year of the main gum-harvesting regions of Kordofan and Darfur in western Sudan.\n\nSince then the raw product, which can only be marketed by Sudanese traders in return for a fee to the RSF, is making its way to Sudans neighbors without proper certification, according to conversations with eight producers and buyers who are directly involved in gum arabic trading or based in Sudan.\n\nThe gum is also exported through informal border markets, two traders told Reuters.\n\nAsked for comment, a RSF representative said that the force had protected the gum arabic trade and only collected small fees, adding that talk of any lawbreaking was propaganda against the paramilitary group.\n\nLast month, the RSF signed a charter with allied groups establishing a parallel government in the parts of Sudan it controls.\n\nIn recent months, traders in countries with lower-gum arabic production than Sudan, such as Chad and Senegal, or which barely exported it before the war, like Egypt and South Sudan, have begun to aggressively offer the commodity at cheap prices and without proof it is conflict-free, two buyers who have been approached by traders told Reuters.\n\nWhile the acacia trees that yield gum arabic grow across the Africas arid Sahel region  known as the gum belt  Sudan has become by far the worlds biggest exporter due to its extensive groves.\n\nHerve Canevet, Global Marketing Specialist at Singapore-based supplier of specialty food ingredients Eco-Agri, said it was often difficult to determine where gum supplies are coming from as many traders would not say if their product has been smuggled.\n\nToday, the gum in Sudan, I would say all of it is smuggled, because theres no real authority in the country, he said.\n\nThe Association for International Promotion of Gums (AIPG), an industry lobby, said in a January 27 public statement it does not see any evidence of links between gum [arabic] supply chain and the competing [Sudanese] forces.\n\nHowever, five industry sources said the opaque new trade in gum risked infiltrating the procurement system of global ingredients makers. Companies like Nexira, Alland & Robert, and Ingredion buy a refined version of the amber-colored gum, turn it into emulsifiers and sell it to big consumer goods firms.\n\nContacted by Reuters, Ingredion said it works to ensure that all supply chain transactions are fully legitimate and has diversified sourcing since the start of the war to include other countries such as Cameroon.\n\nNexira told Reuters the civil war prompted it to cut its imports from Sudan and take proactive measures to mitigate the impact of the conflict on its supply chain, including broadening sourcing to ten other countries.\n\nAlland & Robert, Nestle and Coca Cola did not comment. M&Ms maker Mars and LOreal did not return requests for comment.\n\nCheap gum for sale\n\nMohammed Hussein Sorge, founder of Khartoum-based Unity Arabic Gum, which served global ingredients makers before the war, said he was offered gum arabic in December by traders in Senegal and Chad.\n\nHe said the Chad-based traders wanted $3,500 per ton for hashab gum, a more expensive variety of gum arabic primarily produced in Sudan, for which he would normally expect to pay more than $5,000 per ton.\n\nThe sellers could not provide a Sedex certification, which ensures buyers a supplier meets sustainable and ethical standards, Sorge also told Reuters.\n\nSorge did not buy the gum because he feared the low price and lack of documentation was an indication it had been stolen in Sudan or exported via informal RSF-affiliated networks.\n\nSmugglers manage to smuggle gum arabic through the RSF because the RSF controls all production areas, Sorge said.\n\nSorge, who fled to Egypt after RSF forces stole his entire gum supply in 2023, shared WhatsApp messages with Reuters showing these gum traders had reached out on five separate occasions, including as recently as Jan. 9.\n\nSince October, the RSF banned exports for 12 goods to Egypt, including gum arabic, in retaliation for what it said was Egyptian airstrikes against the militia.\n\nAsked for comment, the paramilitary said it banned what it called smuggling to Egypt because it was not benefiting Sudan.\n\nA buyer, who declined to be named for safety reasons, recounted how he also was approached by shadowy gum traders.\n\nI have [acacia] seyal cleaned open quantities ready for shipping, read one WhatsApp message, reviewed by Reuters and offering a load of seyal gum, a cheaper gum arabic variety.\n\nIn subsequent WhatsApp messages, the trader proposed to schedule shipping every two months at a negotiable price of $1,950 per metric ton, lower than the $3,000 per ton the buyer said he would expect to pay for this kind of load.\n\nIn a different WhatsApp conversation with the same buyer, reviewed by Reuters, a different trader said that trucks carrying gum arabic had crossed the Sudanese border into South Sudan and Egypt.\n\nIn all instances, the gum traders could not provide a Sedex certification, the buyer said, adding that he declined the offers for fear the gum came from RSF-affiliated networks.\n\nChanging routes\n\nBefore the Sudanese civil war, the raw gum would be sorted in Khartoum and then trucked to Port Sudan, on the Red Sea, to be shipped via the Suez Canal around the world.\n\nSince late last year, however, RSF-affiliated gum arabic started to appear on sale at two informal markets on the border between the Sudanese province of West Kordofan and South Sudan, according to a buyer based in an RSF-controlled area, who declined to be named due to safety concerns.\n\nThe buyer, a major trader in the West Kordofan area, said traders collect gum from Sudanese land owners and sell them to South Sudanese traders in these markets for U.S. dollars.\n\nAll of this happens with RSF protection, which the traders pay for, the buyer added.\n\nAbdallah Mohamed, a producer who owns acacia groves in West Kordofan, also told Reuters the RSF takes a fee from the traders for protection. The paramilitary group has diversified its interests into gold, livestock, agriculture and banking.\n\nSouth Sudan Information Minister Michael Makuei, who is also the governments spokesperson, told Reuters transport of gum through South Sudan was not the governments responsibility. Calls and messages to Joseph Moum Majak, the minister of trade and industry for South Sudan, went unanswered.\n\nThe RSF also takes the product to the Central African Republic through the border town of Um Dafoog, the buyer said, adding that some goes to Chad.\n\nA wholesale buyer, based outside Sudan, told Reuters the gum was now being exported through Mombasa in Kenya and South Sudans capital Juba.\n\nArabic gum of illicit origin has also appeared on sale online. Isam Siddig, a Sudanese gum processor who is now a refugee in Britain, told Reuters his warehouses in Khartoum had been raided by the RSF after he fled in April 2023 with three suitcases of gum in tow.\n\nA year later, his gum products appeared on sale, still in his companys branded packaging, in an online Facebook group according to a screenshot shared with Reuters.\n\n",

            "content": "By Nqoba M Sibenke\n\nAs we commemorate Womens Month, it is important for us to explore some of the issues that affect women  a key area being reproductive health.\n\nThe monthly menstrual cycle is a topic less discussed in our circles, yet it presents several issues that affect both men and women. While dysmenorrhea (painful period) is a common topic, the emotional and mental health issues are less explored.\n\nPre-menstrual Syndrome (PMS) is a condition that affects a womans emotions, physical health, and behavior during certain days of the menstrual cycle, generally just before the menses. Due to its nature, PMS also affects the interactions between the patient and those around her. Causes have been linked to reactions due to the change in hormone levels that occurs during this period. The changes may alter the brains chemical composition and affect hormones responsible for emotion regulation. The chief hormones are serotonin and cortisol. A decrease in the hormone serotonin (the feel good hormone) results in depression and anxiety. A rise in cortisol (the stress hormone) results in negative emotions.\n\nThe symptoms of PMS range from mild to severe. While symptoms may be mild in some women, some experience severe symptoms. A severe form of PMS is known as pre-menstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). In the diagnostic manual (DSM iv), PMDD is classified under depressive disorders.

Under the program, they have completed their first year of studying in Zimbabwe.\n\nSpeaking at a send-off ceremony held at the Harare Polytechnic on Thursday in the capital, Harare, Zimbabwes Deputy Minister of Higher and Tertiary Education, Innovation, Science and Technology Development Simelisizwe Sibanda said the initiative marks a significant milestone in Zimbabwes international education collaboration efforts.\n\nThe long-standing partnership between Zimbabwe and China rooted in historical ties has evolved into a dynamic collaboration across multiple sectors, including education, Sibanda said.\n\nSo far, 58 students from two groups have embarked on the same fully funded program, which offers dual certification from both the Harare Polytechnic and Ningbo Polytechnic, he said.\n\nThe collaboration has already yielded positive results, Sibanda said, adding that 30 students who traveled to China under the same program in 2023 have completed their training and already secured job opportunities.\n\nThis demonstrates the programs effectiveness in bridging the critical skills gap and ensuring that graduates contribute meaningfully to Zimbabwes industrialization agenda, said Sibanda.\n\nPanashe Mudondo, one of the beneficiaries of the program, said it will equip students with the necessary skills to promote national development.\n\nWe are thankful for our governments vision and commitment to investing in our education and development. This opportunity is going to make our career path special. I hope and trust that we will bring back new ideas in different ways and become an integral part of Zimbabwes industrialization and modernization agenda, he said.\n\n",
