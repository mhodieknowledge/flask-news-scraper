ZRP officers are stationed at key intersections, including Cameroon, Jason Moyo, Rezende and Robert Mugabe streets.\n\nFurther down the city, Robert Mugabe Square has also been sealed off by anti-riot units, with driving school operators ordered to vacate the area, adding to the uneasy atmosphere.\n\nPolice have also released horses from stables, in what observers described as a show of force and panic by the authorities.\n\nIn a statement issued Thursday, the ZRP warned that any attempts to stage protests would be met with firm resistance.\n\nActs of violence, threats, vandalism, or incitement to commit crime will be severely dealt with in line with the countrys laws.\n\nAny attempts to engage in unlawful demonstrations, gatherings, or processions will be met with the full wrath of the law, read the statement from ZRP.\n\nGeza has called for nationwide demonstrations to express public anger over what he terms state capture and grand corruption by a clique of powerful businessmen allegedly protected by Mnangagwas administration.\n\nHe has also spoken out against Zanu PFs push to extend Mnangagwas rule beyond the constitutionally mandated two terms, which expire in 2028.\n\nThe protests coincide with the ruling partys National Peoples Conference currently underway in Mutare, which has been overshadowed by factional tensions between Mnangagwa and his deputy, Constantino Chiwenga.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nThe Zanu PF political landscape is increasingly volatile, and if current tensions are not carefully managed, the party could face an implosion that threatens its key structures and processes, a political analyst has warned.\n\nIn an interview withNewZimbabwe.com, political analyst Eldred Masunungure said the outcome of the ruling partys ongoing succession battle will hinge on who holds the strategic cards within the power structure.\n\nMasunungure cautioned that delegates attending the ongoing Zanu PF National Peoples Conference in Mutare must address internal divisions decisively to prevent a full-blown crisis.\n\nThe long and short of it is that the Zanu PF pot is overboiling and if not managed well, it may very well explode.\n\nIt is therefore incumbent upon the National Peoples Conference managers to sharpen their conflict resolution skills to abate a dangerous fallout, Masunungure said.\n\nThe conference, currently underway in Mutare is expected to deliberate on key issues including the ailing economy, corruption, and the 2030 agenda. However, the gathering has been overshadowed by factional wars between camps aligned to President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his deputy Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nDuring a Politburo meeting on Tuesday, Chiwenga reportedly questioned why Mnangagwa had not taken action against individuals named in a corruption dossier he presented earlier. Those implicated include controversial businessmen Wicknell Chivayo, Kudakwashe Tagwirei, and gold dealer Pedzai Sakupwanya, who are accused of stealing millions from state coffers.\n\nThe dossier has triggered a fierce backlash from Mnangagwas loyalists, including Zanu PF Secretary for Legal Affairs Ziyambi Ziyambi and party spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa, both of whom have publicly attacked the Vice President.\n\nIn response to the dossier, Ziyambi described Chiwenga as ignorant and accused him of treason, while Mutsvangwa slammed the VP for turning the presidium into a kangaroo court.\n\nCommenting on the power struggle, Masunungure said the decisive factor will be which camp is able to outmanoeuvre the other.\n\nThe critical factor depends on who is capable of outmanoeuvring the other or, to use Donald Trumps language, who has the cards?.\n\nFrom the vantage point of an outsider looking in, it appears like the incumbent Mnangagwa has most of the strategic cards courtesy of the power of incumbency, both in the party and the state.\n\nChiwengas military base has been significantly eroded and cannot be relied on to mount another military-assisted transition. The balance of evidence suggests that Mnangagwa will emerge the winner, on account of the manipulation of incumbency.\n\nRecent changes within Zanu PF have further fuelled speculation of a deliberate purge of Chiwengas allies.\n\nMnangagwa recently removed Obert Mpofu from the influential Secretary General post, reassigning him to the ICT department, and replaced him with Jacob Mudenda.\n\nWithin days, he also dismissed Zanu PF Director General Ezekiel Zabanyana, a move widely seen as an effort to weaken Chiwengas internal support base.\n\nMasunungure warned that the escalating factionalism could spill beyond the party, affecting national governance.\n\nThe fallout will most probably infect the state, its key organs and processes. More broadly, it will further deepen and widen the already worrying societal polarisation.\n\nZanu PF is expected to hold its elective congress in 2027, where the partys succession question may be resolved. Some of the resolutions from the Mutare conference are expected to be implemented in the lead-up to that crucial event.\n\n",

Its a big problem that needs to get real attention, said Munetsi.\n\nWhile there are no official statistics on the number of players defrauded by bogus agents, FIFPro has intensified awareness campaigns across Africa to help players identify legitimate representation and avoid exploitation.\n\n",

We should have 22 companies patrolling our borders, but currently there are only 15. Even these face critical shortages of personnel, vehicles and modern surveillance tools like drones, he said.\n\nThis admission paints a bleak picture of a defence force stretched thin across vast and often inhospitable border terrain.\n\nThe SANDF highlighted further challenges, citing insufficient manpower to monitor the borders shared with Zimbabwe, Botswana and Mozambique. Soldiers are required to patrol hundreds of kilometres with limited resources, and the presence of informal settlements near the Limpopo River has complicated matters, with some residents allegedly assisting illegal crossings.\n\nDakota Legoete, chair of the PCDMV, was equally candid.\n\nIf we are being honest, we dont have functioning borders  and that puts the safety of our country at risk, he said. His comments were echoed by Mr Phiroane Phala, co-chair of the JSCOD, who emphasised the need to balance diplomatic relations with neighbouring countries and the imperative of national security. We cannot allow people to enter and leave the country without control, he said.\n\nCommittee members witnessed the dilapidated state of border fences and identified several areas where illegal crossings are rampant. Soldiers stationed in these zones shared their frustrations over the lack of numbers and support, saying they are unable to effectively monitor the largely unregulated movement of people.\n\nIn response, the committees have pledged to strengthen their oversight efforts.\n\nThey are advocating for increased funding, improved coordination between departments and modernised border infrastructure. They also plan to engage key stakeholders  including the Border Management Authority, the SANDF, the SAPS and SARS  to develop a more unified response to the crisis, with particular focus on the Beitbridge border post.\n\nThe visit comes at a pivotal moment in South Africas border control strategy, underlining the urgency of interdepartmental cooperation and renewed investment in national security infrastructure.\n\n",
