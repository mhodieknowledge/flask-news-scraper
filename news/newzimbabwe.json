Kwekweza has risked a lot for this: she has been arrested several times and has reported torture and intimidation attempts. Every achievement has its price, says Kwekweza.At the end of the day, we have to choose our hard, Kwekweza told DW.If youre abducted for speaking truth to power, if youre in prison for speaking truth to power, its hard, but if youre waking up and youre living a life, a shell of a life that is limited in opportunity and possibility, that is also hard.Representative of a new generationReceiving the German Africa Prize came as a surprise, the young activist admitted.

Those lucky to face the law will be charged with violating the controversial Patriotic Act, a Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) intelligence officer told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nRecently, activist Godfrey Karembera, popularly known as Madzibaba Veshanduko, was reportedly seized by unidentified men, later found in State custody, and allegedly beaten and denied medical care, according to rights groups and independent media.\n\nPolice claim he faces charges under Zimbabwes Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act and are signalling possible use of the Patriotic Act (2023)  a controversial amendment that criminalises conduct deemed to injure the sovereignty and national interest of Zimbabwe.\n\nKaremberas detention betrays a broader climate in which dissent is met with State-linked violence, opaque charges, and expansive security laws, a senior police intelligence officer told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nOnly last week, two student activists from Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) were abducted and tortured. Lindon Zanga (21) and Malvin Madanda (29), who belong to a students union aligned to the opposition, were on November 10 abducted, tortured and dumped by unknown assailants over impending students council elections.\n\nThe recent cases of abductions and torture have reignited concern over a rising pattern targeting government critics.\n\nThese cases fit a long-standing pattern of targeted abductions and intimidation of opposition figures, students, and activists, said Lemuel Mukandawire, a human rights defender.\n\nAs rights organisations, we argue that the Patriotic Acts wording is vague and enables abuse and suppresses legitimate political organising.\n\nThough parts of the 2023 law have been challenged in court, key provisions remain in force and continue to be invoked.\n\nThe legislation, Mukandawire said, is also meant to silence activism beyond Zimbabwes borders.\n\nAuthorities from the Mnangagwa establishment are reportedly closely watching organisers ofdemonstrations inother countries against the 83-year-old Zanu PF leader, whose administration is blamed economic decay that is resulting in droves leaving the country for greener pastures.\n\nThere is a long watchlist of with names of diaspora activists such as Tanyaradzwa Emily Daka, Francis Mubani, Xoliso Sithole, Mollin Muteto, Cretah Mupfudze, Dadirayi Mukwedeya, Ralph Dube, Elizabeth Chitengo, Happiness Ncube, Edgar Mancini, Eness Mapungwana, Nkululeko Ndlovu, Melody Talent Mkwenje, Prince Justin Chihurani, Josephine Mudimbu and others, who are of interest.\n\nZimbabweans in the UK are watching closely, as authorities have hinted that the same law may be applied to those accused of coordinating political activity abroad. The police source cited meetings that took place before and after the failed demonstration in Zimbabwe, further said the police source.\n\nMeetings held in South Africa, UK in Durham led by Shepherd Yuda and Patson Muzuwa, among others, have reportedly rattled President Emmerson Mnangagwas regime accused of running down the economy and gross human rights violations.\n\nRights groups continue to call for independent investigation, medical access, and protection of fundamental freedoms as fears grow that transnational repression may widen.\n\n",

I had really closed the Zimbabwean chapter between Aliko Dangote and my country Zimbabwe. I was doing other things things for other countries for Aliko, said Mahachi.\n\nA cousin contacted me that we need to start this chapter again. I almost blocked him because of the stress that I went through in 2015. Fast forward, here we are. It was one word to Aliko and say let us try again, said Mahachi.\n\nDangote arrived in Zimbabwe last week to sign a potential US$1 billion investment deal that he committed to the country.\n\nHowever, for Mahachi, it was not a stroll in the park to convince Dangote to lend an ear to Zimbabwe for the second time.\n\nHonestly I do not want to lie. I had really closed the Zimbabwean chapter between Aliko Dangote and my country Zimbabwe. I was doing other things things for other countries for Aliko, said Mahachi.\n\nMahachi joined forces with Sikhosana and visited the Dangote Groups plant in Nigeria, which culminated in the billionaires visit to Zimbabwe last week.\n\nDangote pledged to invest several millions in Zimbabwe, targeting cement manufacturing, coal mining, power generation, and fuel pipelines from Walvis Bay, Namibia.\n\nDuring his visit, Dangote acknowledged that the economic environment had changed under the leadership of President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nSikhosana said the visit by the Dangote Industries leadership is a turning point for Zimbabwe.\n\nThe historic visit between the government of Zimbabwe and Dangote Industries, an engagement where we were honoured to advise and play a midwife. This moment not of transaction. It is a turning point. It is a declaration that Zimbabwe. A sign that the global capital is begining to listen.\n\nWe startd this journey in June 2024, no leak no whisper, no breach, said Sikhosana.\n\nAfter the signing of the multi-million-dollar deal, Dangote has already set the wheels in motion, with his team arriving in Zimbabwe this Sunday.\n\n",

The company is disputing the complaints.\n\nGiving evidence to the WRC, the workers said they were approached in Zimbabwe and paid fees of between 2,000 and 3,600 to Unity Healthcare or one of its directors in 2022 or 2023.\n\nGiving evidence, worker Nobuhle Sibanda said Unity Healthcare chief executive Londiwe Maphosa quoted her 1,000 to secure a work permit and informed her she would have to pay 3,000 in total when accommodation costs were factored in.\n\nI couldnt raise the whole amount. I raised 2,600, Ms Sibanda said in evidence. An offer letter, contract and non-disclosure agreement were sent to her after she wired the money to Ms Maphosas co-director in the firm, Bruce Magama.\n\nMost of the group flew to Ireland at their own expense in December 2023 or January 2024 after being told they were going to be starting work within weeks at a care facility that was set to open in Virginia, Co Cavan, they said.\n\nThe pay on offer was in the region of 560 a week on a base hourly rate of 15 an hour, the tribunal heard.\n\nSeveral of the workers moved into a staff house Unity had rented near the centre and training was held for some, but the jobs failed to materialise, the tribunal heard.\n\nThe company director, Mr Magama, told the hearing the centres opening had been delayed, and referred to attempts to arrange employment elsewhere for workers.\n\nHe said one healthcare firm had been willing to take staff, but Ms Sibanda said her understanding was that the other company had made it clear that it was not taking anyone from Unity Healthcare.\n\nThe tribunal was told that at one point, seven workers were living communally in the staff house, some two to a bedroom, others bedding down in its diningroom.\n\nAnother worker, Agapau Munashe Zvihari, said her mother had arranged temporary lodgings for her in Galway, but after the delays, her landlady said: We have to go to Cavan and see if you have this job.\n\nHer landlady had formed the view that the company was being run by scammers, she said. When she spoke to Ms Maphosa, she was told: You signed an NDA [non-disclosure agreement]. Why are you talking to these people youre staying with about our company?\n\nMs Chiwaridzo said the workers at the staff house were scared to talk.\n\nMs Maphosa  who was married to Mr Magama, the witness said  came to the house on one occasion and shouted at us for answering questions from another worker about the opening of the centre.\n\nSome of the workers were able to earn small amounts of money cleaning houses or doing childminding, the tribunal heard.\n\nSeveral workers gave evidence that the company undertook to pay them 100 a week while they were waiting for work, but that this arrangement stopped after three weeks, and some further small ad hoc sums were given to some who complained about financial circumstances.\n\nHowever, others said they received no money at all from the company which had brought them to the Republic for work.\n\nMs Chiwaridzo said the workers living at the staff house pooled their resources to try to pay for electricity, food and heating. It was just not enough, she said.\n\nUnder questioning by Mr Magama, she said the businessman had been sending money for food from January to March 2024 and making some contributions to the heating bill, but not consistently.\n\nMs Chiwaridzo said she needed a letter of no objection from Unity Healthcare, as the sponsor of her work permit, to release her and allow her to take up another employment contract.\n\nIt took from first asking in March 2024 to October that year to get the letter  by which time two job offers had fallen through, she said.\n\nBrenda Mubaiwa said she had left kids at home to come to to the Republic and work, but had only ever been paid 300 by Unity Healthcare. Ms Mubaiwa said that to pay for her son to sit exams, her mother had resorted to borrowing money.\n\nThe workers were giving evidence to the WRC on Thursday. The matter has been adjourned by adjudication officer Breiffni ONeill, who will hear the evidence of a ninth complainant at a later date.\n\nPretty Ndawo and Sylwia Nowakowska of the MRCI appeared for the workers. Mr Magama appeared on his own as respondent.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTOP beverages manufacturer, Delta Corporation Limited has commended the stable ZWG local unit four spurring sales volumes across the group.\n\nThe ZWG currency has sustained stability for most part of 2025, sustaining an exchange rate premium of US$1:ZWG27 since its last major depreciation in September 2024. The conditions have necessitated a tight monetary policy stance and a commitment to maintain the grip on money supply.Presenting the groups performance for the half years period ended September 30 2025, Delta board chairman, Todd Moyo acknowledged the positive impact of stable exchange rates on product sales.The Group benefited from a relatively stable operating environment during the half-year period under review. Consumer spending remained strong, driven by a stable ZWG exchange rate, the record-breaking tobacco marketing season, increased mining activities and the firm mineral prices, particularly gold.Diaspora remittances are also benefiting from the firming of cross exchange rates such as the Rand and Pound, our key source markets, he said.During the period, group revenue for the half year at US$514 million increased by 32% compared to the prior year, reflecting volume growth across the Zimbabwe business units and the inclusion of Schweppes as a subsidiary.The revenue growth was weighed down by the price moderations in the Sparkling Beverages business, which partly absorbed the sugar tax to maintain volume and competitiveness. The proportion of domestic sales undertaken in foreign currency was 92% during the period under review.Moyo said the Zimbabwe Gold (ZWG), was relatively stable during the half year, reducing the level of rate estimation for compliance with IFRS and IAS 21. The rates used at the reporting date were within the ranges allowed by the monetary regulations.Profit After Tax (PAT) surged by nearly 83% to US$75,05 million for the six months ended September 30, 2025, largely driven by robust revenue growth of 32% and a sharp decline in exchange losses.Lager beer volumes rose 21%, supported by stronger consumer incomes and stable pricing.The sorghum beer category expanded 16%, buoyed by firm demand from mining communities and commercial agriculture, while sparkling beverages registered an 11% increase, reflecting modest recovery amid sugar tax pressures.Delta subsidiary, African Distillers Limited, delivered the strongest outturn, with overall volumes up 43%led by wine (59%), ready-to-drink beverages (47%) and spirits (36%).\n\nThe ZWG currency has sustained stability for most part of 2025, sustaining an exchange rate premium of US$1:ZWG27 since its last major depreciation in September 2024.
