            "content": "By Business Insider\n\nCHINAS push to globalize its currency, the yuan, is gaining traction in Africa, with the continent emerging as a strategic testing ground for Beijings broader de-dollarization ambitions.\n\nIn a recent milestone, the central banks of China and Egypt signed a series of agreements to increase yuan use in bilateral trade and investment.\n\nThe deals, signed during Chinese Premier Li Qiangs visit to Cairo last week, were praised by Peoples Bank of China governor Pan Gongsheng as a key step in advancing economic ties between the two countries.\n\nKey provisions include electronic payment cooperation such as expanding Chinas UnionPay system in Egypt, and enabling cross-border yuan-denominated transactions for banks operating in the China-Egypt TEDA Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone.\n\nThese financial operations will be processed through the Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), Chinas alternative to the SWIFT network, thereby reducing reliance on Western financial systems.\n\nWith this development, Egypt now joins a growing list of African nations, including South Africa, Nigeria, and Angola, that are actively incorporating the yuan into their trade and financial dealings with China.\n\nChinas growing currency ambition in Africa\n\nThe expansion of the yuan across Africa is part of Chinas broader strategy to challenge the dominance of the U.S. dollar.\n\nThis move aligns with the continents gradual shift away from Western financial systems toward a China-Russia-led coalition under BRICS, reflecting a strategic effort to diversify trade and currency frameworks.\n\nChina-Africa trade reached $282 billion in 2023, cementing Chinas 15-year run as the continents top trading partner. The surge has boosted renminbi use in cross-border deals and reserve holdings.\n\nBeyond Egypt, where the central banks recently signed agreements to deepen yuan usage in trade and investment, China has steadily advanced its currency diplomacy across Africa.\n\nAs early as 2015, South Africa signed a 30 billion yuan swap deal to improve trade liquidity. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) explained that the three-year agreement was designed to facilitate trade and investment and serve as a buffer for short-term balance of payment pressures.\n\nEarlier this year, Nigeria and China renewed their bilateral currency swap deal valued at 15 billion yuan (3.19 trillion), three years after the initial agreement expired.\n\nThe Peoples Bank of China said the renewed three-year pact aims to promote bilateral trade and investment facilitation.\n\nIn Angola, a key oil supplier to China, the yuan is increasingly being used in energy and infrastructure transactions, with the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), Chinas alternative to SWIFT, being integrated into the financial system.\n\nLauren Johnston, a senior research fellow at the AustChina Institute and China-Africa expert, told the South China Morning Post that Africa offers a strategic testbed for Beijings currency goals.\n\nAfrica is a continent where trade with China is important, but it is also one where many countries struggle to access sufficient foreign currencies such as the euro or US dollar, she noted.\n\nJohnston added, For China, there may be a chance to test the internationalisation of the RMB via a few countries in Africa first, where volumes might be small on a global scale and Chinas footprint in the region relatively large.\n\nThese efforts mark a broader rebalancing of global financial influence, with China positioning the yuan as a viable alternative in Africas evolving economic landscape.\n\n",

And the number increases as time goes on.\n\nSo we are saying 1,300 plus more each year, which means a large number of children are dying, said Machawira.\n\nHe also noted that for many children born with heart problems, receiving treatment after the age of two has limited impact, as they would have already been debilitated by the illness.\n\nOutside of the two camps with Egyptian specialists, Machawira said Parirenyatwa Hospital has performed around 55 open heart surgeries from June 2023 to date.\n\nZimbabwe has limited capacity to offer open heart surgeries due to a lack of resources and personnel while most patients with heart-related ailments cannot afford treatment abroad, where costs can be as high as US$15,000.\n\n",
