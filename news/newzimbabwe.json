Of course, that means a lot of it was negative. But lets keep the things that werent. Formal education is a legacy. Hospitals are a legacy. Electricity generation is a legacy. Hot water is a legacy. Shall we get rid of all of that in the name of decolonization?\n\nUniversities are a legacy. Are we going to get rid of the universities? Science  are we going to get rid of science? No. And one thing I learned in Singapore is that they have become an unbelievable country.\n\nI mean, Zimbabwe started its independence in a much stronger position than Singapore. Yeah, at about the same time. Look at Zimbabwe now. Look at Singapore.\n\nWhat is the difference? And I went there and looked very hard to see why Zimbabwe had gone back to trading with cattle and goats, swapping things in a barter system for other goods, said Zille.\n\nZimbabwe has endured economic hardships, with bouts of inflation and the failure of its local currency, which has characterized its malaise.\n\nThe government has blamed the economic decline on sanctions imposed by the United States.\n\nZille said Zimbabwe failed to replicate Singapore alsoa former British colony.\n\nSo, what did they get right in Singapore? A lot of things. One of the things they got right is that they didnt tear down everything they inherited from the British.\n\nThey took those institutions and built them up into some of the best in the world. Thats what I was saying  take what you inherit from the past, even if a lot of the past was bad, she said.\n\n",

Mangeyi also put it that the complainant and accused do not reside at the same residence and prayed for court to grant him US$50 bail, among other reporting conditions.\n\nState did not oppose bail, but proposed a review of the quantum of bail to US$100. The prosecution also averred that stringent bail conditions were only necessary if there were fears an accused person might abscond or interfere with State witnesses.\n\nRegional Magistrate Ignatius Mugova remanded accused person on free bail to January 10, 2025 for routine remand. The ruling sparked frenzied celebrations among the sizeable crowd of Karurus followers, who packed the courtroom in solidarity with the cleric.\n\nCircumstances are that sometime in 2019 complainant was staying at the Staff Quarters section of Chikonohono with the pastors family.\n\nIt is alleged that accused person and complainant would play games on a mobile phone and the former took advantage to fondle and have sexual intercourse with the girl without her consent.\n\nCourt further heard accused person threatened complainant with unspecified action if she disclosed the rape encounters to anyone as this would ruin his marriage and career.\n\nThe sexual violations are said to have continued from 2019 up to September 2024 when the matter came to light.\n\nThe victim was referred to Chinhoyi Provincial Hospital for medical examination and an affidavit can be produced in court as an exhibit.\n\nThe state submitted that the accused person acted unlawfully.\n\n",

As we traverse in our Presidents mantra ofleaving no one and no place behind she said.\n\nThe top government official said the slated projects by PLZ were aimed at addressing some of the most pressing challenges facing our communities in the Goromonzi district such as the community health project, the vocational training project, the womens empowerment project and energy equity project.\n\nMunzverengwi said these initiatives will help create jobs, and stimulate local economies in the pursuit to improve the provincial GDP and will go a long way in improving the livelihood of our general populace in the district, the province and the nation at large.\n\nI am also delighted that PLZ found it prudent and sensible to also give hampers to eighty-four elderly-headed households from the villages surrounding the PLZ plant. This complimentary gesture is plausible, giving Christmas to the befitting vulnerable elderly beneficiaries.\n\nThe hampers for the elderly are essential in ensuring that our seniors receive the nourishment they need to maintain a healthy well-being. Many elderly individuals experience loneliness and isolation and through programs like food hampers distribution there is a sense of community and social connection, she added.\n\n",
