            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nAS the Zanu PF annual conference kicks off this week, the ruling party is urging discipline within its rank-and-file amid social media claims alleging plans to heckle Vice President Constantino Chiwenga during the event, as the succession debate intensifies.\n\nChiwenga is widely regarded as the frontrunner to succeed President Emmerson Mnangagwa in 2028 when his second term expires. However, his path to the presidencywhile seemingly straightforwardis reportedly being obstructed by Mnangagwas loyalists, who are pushing for an extension of the Presidents tenure to 2030.\n\nAmong these loyalists is a group of controversial business figures, including convicted businessman Wicknell Chivayo, Paul Tungwarara, and Kudakwashe Tagwirei, who have publicly and repeatedly pledged to support Mnangagwas continued leadership beyond 2028.\n\nIn recent days, social media has been awash with claims that Zanu PF youths are being bussed to Mutare, Manicaland province, for the sole purpose of booing Chiwengaa development seen as a sign that the succession battle is escalating.\n\nZanu PF Director of Communication, Farai Marapira, dismissed the allegations, insisting that the partys conference would not be used to heckle senior leaders, as attendance is restricted to vetted delegates.\n\nWe are not going to a rally. We are going to a conference. This is not a free for all. This is a meeting of delegates. This is a meeting of leadership. There is no time to heckle. This is just once again social media trying its best to push agendas on us as Zanu PF. But of course it will fail, he said.\n\nMarapira further stated that those promoting claims of planned disruption were ignorant of the partys internal procedures.\n\nThis issue of being bussed to boo, how are they going to enter when they are not accredited? We are not accrediting crowds, we are accrediting delegates. This is mischief being created by people who are ignorant of the ways of the party and how it conducts its conferences, Marapira said.\n\nThe alleged plans to heckle Chiwenga come against the backdrop of his sustained stance against corruption, which he has consistently described as a threat to national security. Chiwenga has publicly condemned prominent businessmenamong them Chivayo, Tungwarara, Tagwirei, and Delish Nguwayathough without naming them directly, referring instead to the group as Zvigananda a deragatory term for plunderers.\n\nLast month, Chiwenga reportedly presented a detailed corruption dossier during a Zanu PF Politburo meeting, implicating Nguwaya, Chivayo, Tagwirei, and Tungwarara. Analysts claim the dossier was so damaging that President Mnangagwa had to abandon his planned trip to the United States, where he was scheduled to lead Zimbabwes campaign for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA SUPERVISOR at China Zhuhe Mining, identified as Zilu, has been charged with murder by police after allegedly killing a local man, Fungai Nhau, on Thursday.\n\nIt is alleged Zilu fired live ammunition at the deceased in the fatal shooting which occurred in Mutoko, Mashonaland East province.The mining company claims that Nhau, along with accomplices, invaded the mining premises with the intention of committing a crime, including theft. They say Zilu fired warning shots into the air to deter the would-be robbers.The mining firm further stated that Nhaus body was discovered a kilometre away from the company premises, having been abandoned by his accomplices.Zilu, the supervisor, is said to have rushed to the scene where the body was found and spoke with the deceased, who purportedly confirmed he had been injured during the attempted robbery and then deserted by his colleagues.At approximately 7am the same day, local workers on the early shift discovered a critically injured gangster about 1kilometre from the crime scene. They promptly reported the matter to Mr. Zilu, the local translator who also served as the direct supervisor.Mr. Zilu rushed to the scene immediately; upon questioning the gangster, the latter admitted to being injured during the robbery and abandoned at the scene by his accomplices. Mr. Zilu immediately arranged to report the case to the police, but unfortunately, the gangster had already passed away when the police arrived, part of the companys statement reads.However, China Zhuhe Minings version of events starkly contrasts with the police charge sheet for Zilu, thereby raising suspicion of a cover-up attempt.Accused person is an employee of Zhuhe Mining Investments, Mudzi and he is the security supervisor. On the 09th of October 2025 at around 0030hrs, the accused person was on duty when he observed the now deceased Fungai Nhau who was with his friends going towards carbon room where pregnant carbons are kept.He then suspected them to be thieves and fired ten live rounds towards the direction of the now deceased. This resulted in the bullet hitting the now deceased on the left lower back.The now deceased sustained an entry gunshot wound which resulted in the bullet lodging inside the body. The now deceased was carried by his friends for considerable distance of about a kilometre before they abandoned him.At about 0700hrs on the same day, the now deceaseds body was discovered by mine workers who then alerted the police. The body of the now deceased was conveyed to Mutoko Hospital where it was pronounced dead by a doctor. The fire arm used by the accused person in the shooting of the now deceased is held as an exhibit, part of the police charge sheet for Zilu reads.Renowned lawyer Fadzayi Mahere has questioned why the China Zhuhe Mining supervisor took the law into his own hands and why he failed to report the incident to the police for seven hours.The companys statement leaves more questions than answers. If only warning shots were fired into the air as alleged, how was a person killed? Why did the company officials take the law into their own hands instead of calling @PoliceZimbabwe?If this version is to be believed, why were the police not called for a good 7 hours yet the company officers knew theyd fired shots at people whom they spuriously conclude were robbers and gangsters? Is there any regret for the needless loss of life? Why are early Police reports suggesting the murder victim was a worker as opposed to a gangster as curiously alleged by the company?Mahere has urged the police to leave no stone unturned in their investigations, insisting that the perpetrator must face the full force of the law.The Mutoko incident highlights the ongoing tensions between local communities and Chinese investors.This is not an isolated incident; reports indicate that throughout the country, Chinese nationals are experiencing friction with local communities concerning working environments and conditions, safety protocols, and allegations of harassment.These tensions are further exacerbated by Chinese mining operations which, it is claimed, demonstrate a disregard for historical landmarks and sites of cultural significance to local populations. Recent inquiries have focused on the alleged destruction of Mutares Christmas Pass.Last week, former Cabinet Minister Fortune Chasi commented that the core issue lies not with the Chinese themselves, but with local individuals and leadership figures who are granting mining licences enabling Chinese companies to mine indiscriminately across the country, and who are failing to adequately oversee these activities within their respective jurisdictions.\n\nIt is alleged Zilu fired live ammunition at the deceased in the fatal shooting which occurred in Mutoko, Mashonaland East province.\n\nThe mining company claims that Nhau, along with accomplices, invaded the mining premises with the intention of committing a crime, including theft.

This resulted in the bullet hitting the now deceased on the left lower back.The now deceased sustained an entry gunshot wound which resulted in the bullet lodging inside the body.

            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo l IOL\n\nActionSA has slammed Home Affairs Minister Dr Leon Schreibers decision to extend the validity of the Zimbabwean Exemption Permits (ZEPs) until 28 May 2027, describing it as another sign of indecision and weakness from the government.\n\nIn a statement, ActionSA parliamentary chief whip Lerato Ngobeni MP said the extension showed the governments unwillingness to confront South Africas immigration crisis head-on.South Africa does not need endless extensions. We need decisive leadership, firm timelines, and an unwavering commitment to the rule of law, Ngobeni said.She said while ActionSA supports a humane and orderly approach to immigration, the ongoing pattern of temporary measures has eroded public confidence, undermined border integrity, and perpetuated inequality between citizens and foreign nationals.Ngobeni said the ministers justification that consultations with the Immigration Advisory Board were still ongoing offers no comfort to South Africans who have waited years for decisive action.There is still no clear, time-bound plan to resolve this long-standing issue, leaving our borders porous and our immigration system in disarray, she said.ActionSA has called on Schreiber to publish a comprehensive transition plan with firm deadlines for the conclusion of consultations and implementation of immigration reforms. The party also urged the strengthening of the Border Management Authority and improved internal enforcement to curb illegal immigration.Ngobeni said every further delay deepens social tensions, weakens accountability, and tells law-abiding South Africans that their government lacks the political courage to lead.On Thursday, IOL reported that the Helen Suzman Foundation welcomed the extension of both the Zimbabwean and Lesotho Exemption Permits, saying it would prevent potential humanitarian harm and allow time for a more sustainable policy framework to be developed.According to the Foundation, the extension will allow current ZEP and LEP holders to remain lawfully in South Africa while the minister conducts nationwide consultations. This follows a 2023 Pretoria High Court ruling in which HSF successfully challenged a previous decision to terminate the ZEP programme without prior notice or public consultation.The ministers directive clarifies that ZEP and LEP holders cannot be arrested, detained, or deported under section 34 of the Immigration Act due to an invalid exemption certificate. Holders may also freely enter or depart South Africa under immigration regulations and will not need to produce a valid exemption certificate when applying for another visa category under section 10(2) of the Act.\n\nIn a statement, ActionSA parliamentary chief whip Lerato Ngobeni MP said the extension showed the governments unwillingness to confront South Africas immigration crisis head-on.\n\nSouth Africa does not need endless extensions.
