Now, eight months later, we are treating more complicated conditions in much younger patients, he said.The head of Cardiothirac Surgery Department at Parirenyatwa Hospital Dr. Simukayi Machawira said there were no complications during the just-ended camp.Im happy to report that the outcomes have been very positive, he said.During the visit, the specialists were preparing their last patient for surgery.Deputy minister of Health Sleiman Kwidini said he is happy that Zimbabwe is now able to perform open-heart surgeries.This is a major breakthrough for our healthcare system. Previously, we were not conducting these types of open-heart surgeries locally.Now, we have reached a milestone. All these major operations that we are witnessing are now being done in our own hospitals, Kwidini said.Egyptian Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Ms. Salwa Mowafi said Egypt is committed to working with Zimbabwe to improve the health of those living with heart ailments.Many patients in Zimbabwe die of heart- relating ailments as they cannot afford to get treatment abroad with costs going up to as much as US$15,000.Zimbabwe conducted its maiden open-heart surgeries in June 2023 while paediatric procedures started in November 2023.\n\nThe initiative has brought relief to parents of children with congenital hearts problems, who have been struggling to raise funds for these complex procedures which are usually done abroad.\n\nParents who spoke to NewZimbabwe.com during the tour of the surgical camp said the quotations of between US$15 000 and US$20 000 for treatment in other countries were beyond their reach and expressed their gratitude for the free services.There was no way I was going to raise such an amount and Im happy that my daughter was selected during the screening process, said Nyarai Chachoka from Tynwald in HarareEach year, around 4,000 children in the country are born with congenital heart conditions that require open-heart surgery while the nation currently has a waiting list of between 500 and 600 adults with rheumatic heart disease in need of the medical procedure.The second paediatrics surgical camp was facilitated by Egyptian and local cardiac specialists with support from Cimas, Gift of Life International in collaboration with Rotarians, Harare Central, the government, National Oil and Infrastructure Company (NOIC), Avenues Clinic, Simbisa Brands, and other well-wishers.Open heart surgeon Dr Hisham Shawky said this will be a rolling programme.During our first visit in November, we handled simpler cases.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE trial of former Agriculture Deputy Minister Douglas Karoro took a new twist on Friday with the investigating officer contradicting the States case.\n\nKaroro is accused of fraud, which allegedly led to 700 bags of fertilizers meant for beneficiaries in Mbire under the Presidential Input Scheme being taken from the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) Mushumbi depot.Karoro has denied the allegations saying he is a political victim, denying ever conniving with anyone or ever visiting the GMB Mushumbi depot where the fertilizers were allegedly taken.Chief Inspector Violet Chikuni, who investigated the matter told Regional Magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa that there was no misrepresentation that was made to GMB Mushumbi.Instead, she said, misrepresentation was made to GMB Aspindale where alleged fake Compound D fertilisers were allegedly swapped with Ammonium Nitrate, which was then taken back to GMB Mushumbi.This was a direct contradiction to the States case that had been presented and argued from the onset that the alleged misrepresentation was made to GMB Mushumbi resulting in 700 bags of fertilisers being siphoned.The defence led by Admire Rubaya showed her the charge sheet which was being used in court against the former parliamentarian and three others and she confirmed there was no allegation that misrepresentation happened at GMB Aspindale or that fake fertilisers were used to conduct the alleged swap.There was no misrepresentation at Mushumbi. Misrepresentation happened at GMB Aspindale where fake fertilisers were swapped for AN, she said.Chikuni claimed Karoro sold the fertilizers and received US$10,000 for his own use. She however conceded that there was no evidence of Karoro communicating or transacting with the alleged buyer of fertilizers.Cornered by the defence, she conceded she ought to have obtained call records and triangulation reports for the alleged communication with the buyer and his people in Mushumbi.She, further, found it difficult to prove the sale after the defence asked her to provide evidence that money exchanged hands to which she responded saying there was no documentary evidence.Chikuni further claimed Karoro phoned officials at GMB Aspindale to have them release the AN fertilizer in exchange of Compound D as a cover up to the allegations.She was asked to provide call history between Karoro and GMB officials for the alleged phone calls which she did not have.The defence said her lack of evidence before the court shows that she was being used and misused by Karoros political rivals Now Gumbo and Takesure Chikwamba, who were identified in open court by Rubaya as having proceeded to court to ensure that she tows the line.The two, Gumbo and Chikwamba, who are Zanu PF District Coordinating Committee chairman and security secretary respectively, were seated in court when they were blasted for fabricating the case against Karoro and contaminating evidence by conducting their parallel investigations which include getting documents at GMB Mushumbi.The defence said Chikuni launched her investigation based on contaminated evidence given to her by Karoros foes in Mushumbi.This came after she told the court that she got to know about the allegations through an informer whom she could not name.The top cop said she was prepared to lose the case than divulge the informers name.She alleged that the informer was a GMB Mushumbi employee resulting in the defence arguing that she investigated the matter taking evidence from a poisoned well.It was put to her that there was nothing for her to hide as Chikwamba told the court in the previous session that he was the one who took the report to the police.The matter continues on August 5.\n\nKaroro is accused of fraud, which allegedly led to 700 bags of fertilizers meant for beneficiaries in Mbire under the Presidential Input Scheme being taken from the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) Mushumbi depot.\n\nKaroro has denied the allegations saying he is a political victim, denying ever conniving with anyone or ever visiting the GMB Mushumbi depot where the fertilizers were allegedly taken.Chief Inspector Violet Chikuni, who investigated the matter told Regional Magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa that there was no misrepresentation that was made to GMB Mushumbi.Instead, she said, misrepresentation was made to GMB Aspindale where alleged fake Compound D fertilisers were allegedly swapped with Ammonium Nitrate, which was then taken back to GMB Mushumbi.This was a direct contradiction to the States case that had been presented and argued from the onset that the alleged misrepresentation was made to GMB Mushumbi resulting in 700 bags of fertilisers being siphoned.The defence led by Admire Rubaya showed her the charge sheet which was being used in court against the former parliamentarian and three others and she confirmed there was no allegation that misrepresentation happened at GMB Aspindale or that fake fertilisers were used to conduct the alleged swap.There was no misrepresentation at Mushumbi.
