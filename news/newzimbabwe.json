            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE United Kingdom (UK) has removed former Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) boss Isaac Moyo, police Commissioner General Godwin Matanga and former army commander Anselem Sanyatwe from its sanctions list.\n\nMinister of State for Midlands and former Minister of State Security, Owen Ncube and the Zimbabwe Defence Industries (ZDI) have also been removed from the list.\n\nAnnounced in a statement Tuesday, the four top officials and ZDI had been under sanctions for various human rights-related abuses.\n\nMoyo headed the dreaded CIO from 2017 until his exit earlier this year, taking charge of operations that included intimidation, abduction and assault of opposition politicians, human rights activists and journalists.\n\nNcube has been accused of being the godfather of mining gangs in the Midlands. He was fingered as the main man behind violent attacks that claimed the life of an opposition supporter in Kwekwe, in the run-up to the 2018 elections.\n\nThe UK announces the delisting of sanctions against individuals Owen Ncube, Isaac Moyo, Godwin Matanga, Anselem Sanyatwe, and the entity Zimbabwe Defence Industries (ZDI), reads a statement on the UK governments website.\n\nThe revocations follow a similar move from the European Union in February 2025, when they delisted their last remaining entity (ZDI) whilst renewing their existing Zimbabwe sanctions framework.The US also removed a number of designations in March 2024.\n\nZDI was listed by the UK soon after late President Robert Mugabe chucked out the European Union (EU) observer mission ahead of the 2002 elections.\n\nIt stood accused of providing arms used in the abuse of ordinary Zimbabweans.\n\nThe recent round of removals will be taken as a triumph for President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who has been on an overdrive courting the West.\n\nOver recent years, the EU, UK and America have eased restrictions on Zimbabweans and entities that had been fingered in corruption and human rights abuses.\n\n",

Since 2021 to date, only four of the seven vehicles have been delivered, leaving three outstanding, Guvamatanga said.\n\nHe told PAC the company had made an undertaking to deliver the outstanding vehicles by the 2nd of July 2025.\n\nThe ministry has also returned to pass a request for the outcome of the debatement hearing to enable the initiation of federal protection against the supplier if they fail to deliver in July.\n\nAlso, the ministry has ensured that no prepayments are made to suppliers of vehicles before delivery.\n\nPayments are only made for vehicles that are already delivered.\n\nIn the event that the supplier is set to receive an advance payment, the ministry will ensure that a bank guarantee equivalent to the requested payment value is provided by a registered commercial bank, said the Finance secretary.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nLISTED transport and logistics concern, Unifreight Africa Limited says the countrys tough economy added to high licensing fees is making operations very tough.\n\nIndustry has since raised similar concerns with the government over the years, now with several promises to deal with the problem being made. Several value chains in the economy are clogged with very costly, repetitive licensing fees, choking the ease of doing business.\n\nEchoing similar sentiments recently, Unifreights CEO, Richard Clarke, bemoaned the exorbitant licensing fees affecting transport sector players in the country.\n\nIn the transport sector specifically, operating costs in Zimbabwe are significantly higher than in neighbouring countries, which continues to squeeze margins. For example, fuel in Zimbabwe remains the most expensive in the region at around US$1,58 per litre, compared to about US$1,01 in Zambia. Vehicle registration and licensing fees are also exorbitantly high at roughly US$1,560 locally versus just US$132 in Zambia, he said.\n\nAdditionally, he said, diesel imports carry heavy duties (approx. USD 0.55 per litre)withexporters being forced to surrender 25% of foreign earnings for conversion into local currency (ZWG), which cannot be freely converted back to US$ at market rates.\n\nClarke said the combination of these challenges, added to currency volatility, liquidity constraints, inflationary pressures and a shortage of long-term financing in the local market, led many businesses to tighten their belts, creating a knock-on effect across supply chains.\n\nThe company said compounding cost pressures is the ongoing liquidity crunch in the banking sector prompting many financial institutions to pull back on lending, forcing companies, including Unifreight and our customers, to rely on shorter-term and more expensive financing.\n\nThese factors make operating a cross-border fleet out of Zimbabwe less attractive and more costly than regional competitors, Clarke said.\n\nMeanwhile, during the period, Unifreight Africa Limited delivered a strong start to 2025, with significant revenue growth in Q1.\n\nTotal revenues for the quarter surged by over 30% compared to the same period last year, reflecting robust demand and the success of recent strategic initiatives. Annual turnover rose from US$20.4 million in 2023 to US$24 million in 2024, and is forecast to reach US$32 million in 2025.\n\n",
