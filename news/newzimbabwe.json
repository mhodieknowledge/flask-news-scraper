As I confuse thyself in the bars of the prison that is my mind.\n\nThis journey has been a tapestry woven with threads of trials and triumphs. Each moment a stitch in the fabric of the collective nation called GAFA, said Winky D.\n\nIn this tumultuous year, Winky D discovered flickers of joy amid the shadows. As the year 2024 drew to a close, he faced significant hurdles that threatened to overwhelm him.\n\nOne of the most challenging moments was losing his beloved venue, the Harare International Conference Centre (HICC), known affectionately as paJabuna, where he has hosted his iconic New Years Eve shows.\n\nDespite securing the place as early as May 2024, the venue was in a biased manner given to gospel musician Everton Mlalazi, who has strong ties to the Zanu PF acolyte Kudakwashe Tagwirei.\n\nThis unexpected setback was a heavy blow for the artist, who expressed, Amidst the tempest, we found flickers of joy and connection through music. Towards the end, I faced hurdles that overwhelmed my feeble heart.\n\nAnxiety gripped me as I pondered how to close this chapter on a high note, said the dreadlocked artist.\n\nThe loss of the HICC venue was described as sabotage, yet, amidst this uncertainty, a beacon of hope emerged as his loyal fans in the United Kingdom and Bulawayo embraced his last shows of the year.\n\nYour presence at my live shows in the UK and Bulawayo became the beacon of light during dark hours!\n\nDances on the edge of uncertainty, anxiety and excitement fought within me. But you, the Gafas, sang along. Hope flickered anew.\n\nYour unwavering loyalty and vibrant enthusiasm reminded me of the profound unbreakable bond we have shared over the years.\n\nBefore the HICC debacle, Winky D in 2023 faced a ban on State media over Eureka Eureka, only to be unbanned in 2024 according to NewZimbabwe.com sources.\n\nHowever, certain songs from Winky Ds Eureka Eureka album, such as Ibotso and Dzimba Dzemabwe, remain banned.\n\nDuring his 2023-2024 New Years Eve concert, Winky D acknowledged the impact of the blackout on his music.\n\nFrom 2004 up until 2024, 2023 was the most difficult year for me musically, said Winky D.\n\nI could not get an interview on the radio for the show. I only had the internet and dreams and then you (fans), he further said.\n\nAs the new year dawns, the GAFA, stands ready to embrace whatever challenges and triumphs await, thanking his fans for their love and loyalty towards him and his Vigilance Band.\n\nEach note I play and every lyric I sing is dedicated to you. Your energy fuels my creativity and commitment to our cause. Thank you for being my strength during these trying times.\n\nYour support transcends words; it is a lifeline that propels me forward. Together, let us carry this momentum into the new year, embracing both challenges and triumphs that might await us on the horizon.\n\nHappy Twenty Twenty Strive, he wrote.\n\n",

Do you think they would fail to love you for your goodness or for your excellent deeds? Do you think that even God Himself would fail to add blessings on top of others? Out of respect for you, we give you honor; your dignity will forever be associated with your name. Your actions increase the glory of Gods goodness, said Jah\n\nThe award-winning artists praises to Chivayo have alienated the very fans who have supported him through thick and thin, many of whom are disillusioned by the rampant corruption that has plagued their lives.\n\nBELOW IS JAH PRAYZAH SHONA STATEMENT CONVERTED TO ENGLISHYou were born with an open hand that uplifts the orphans, the widows and less privileged.

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nEVEN though public health facilities continue providing HIV and AIDS medication with more players tackling the endemic, dealing with the condition, sexual reproductive health and rights (SRHR) issues, focus on the subject seems to be taking a dead seat, an activist has said.\n\nMartha Todhlana told media health practitioners during a Media and Science Cafe Programme in Harare recently that it was sad to note HIV counselling issues had declined with a lot of people now out of support programmes and no longer getting some health services such as health checks and or monitoring.\n\nOnce the universal programme started to say anyone who tests can just test and treat, I think issues of counselling have declined and also people not seeing the need for being in support groups.\n\nYou will find that currently, a lot of people who are in support groups now are those who tested some years back, before we had the programme as it is, but those who started treatment in the test and treat programme, a lot of them are not in support groups because they dont see the need.\n\nI think a positive is that public health facilities continue providing HIV medication and there are more players tackling HIV, tackling sexual and reproductive health and rights, SRHR, but sadly I think focus on HIV seems to be taking a dead seat, Todhlana said.\n\nAll this, according to her, has been attributed to several reasons amongst them a weak psycho-social support system, a shift in funding which is now more focused on young people and to a certain extent, the emergence of non-communicable diseases that are on the increase.\n\nMany people with HIV are struggling with non-communicable diseases, which are not properly managed, and some non-communicable diseases come with extreme pain. Those sharing their experiences indicate that the pain management approach is almost close to none.\n\nI think this is linked to funding and there is a focus on young people, which is good, especially adolescent girls and young women.\n\nWe have seen an improvement on the PrEP issues, but the realities that we consider as we get into 2025 include sadly that HIV stigma and discrimination persists, the level of domestic funding for health and particularly HIV is worryingly too low, Todhlana, who tested HIV positive in 2003 added.\n\nShe explained further: And the continued focus on young people or the 0-49 age group ignores the effect of HIV successes, which means people are ageing with HIV.\n\nBecause when we celebrate the success, by the way I turned 16 last week and Im already out of the 0-49 age group and I get my treatment from the public health sector and it is very obvious that you are autistic outside, but I see so many people who are even older than me, living with HIV and getting their treatment and then you are left to your own individual and without the proper care and support.\n\nI think the HIV facility used to be linked to a robust psycho-social support system, but a lot of times I see that this is no longer available and also it was still for people who are more than 49.\n\nAccording to Todhlana, her worry is the upkeep of the young adults born with HIV.\n\nI keep worrying about who is looking after them and the language we still use around young people is being reckless. We say Im a 2,000 reckless, but we call, and they are putting themselves in situations where they can get HIV. They are putting themselves at risk, but we forget that there is that cohort of young people who were not reckless.\n\nShe said many of those who were born with HIV or might have got it from breast milk before we know what we know now are quite a big number in our population who are in this cohort.\n\nSo, when I talk of people ageing with HIV, I include these young people. And then people diagnosed in their adulthood, like me, we have more than 20 years of treatment and Im increasing in number.\n\nTodhlana spoke of ART side effects saying a lot of lives were being lost because of less attention and monitoring to those taking ARVs.\n\nOn the packaging of the ARVs, the side effects are written, they are very clearly written there to say your kidneys will be affected, your liver will be affected, you know, a whole lot of organs will be affected so they need to be monitored regularly.\n\nBut I, I think the reason they are not being monitored is because when they were doing the monitoring there was external funding to do that and once the external fund has left, then it is no longer there because our labs are no longer eternally being funded.\n\nShe also raised issues to do with menopause and social isolation issues to those living with HIV.\n\nMenopause is coming much earlier for women with HIV than for those who do not have HIV. Maybe 10 years or so earlier.\n\nAnd then also the social isolation at times. With social isolation, I havent been to church for three years now. Im someone who enjoys going for Sunday services and going for midweek services. I havent been inside a church for the past three years.\n\nI was diagnosed of HIV in 2000, then diagnosis of arthritis in my spine in 2008, that was five years after starting ARVs in 2003. But the ARVs we were taking, were too many, at least three tablets three times a day, compared to one tablet once a day. You see how our researchers continue to improve. Today we have progressed to one tablet every 24 hours.\n\nShe stated that research studies are very important.\n\nClinical research and social research have been very important to the response to HIV. And also Im hoping to see that theres also media doing their research as well, as media, to make sure that they contribute to the body of knowledge that is building on our HIV response, she explained.\n\nTodhlana has a daughter, now at university, born without HIV to a mother living with HIV.\n\nShe gave credit to GALZ for the support given during her most difficult time of life.\n\n",

I shed no tears, said Manyenyeni.\n\nFormer Harare mayor, Bernard Manyenyeni\n\nI disowned this misplaced mantra some years ago when I was still leading this council.\n\nAs usual, there was a sustained attempt to carry the empty noises onto as late as last night (31 December).\n\nManyenyeni did not wholly heap the blame on council, but he raised issues with laws which govern councils, central government interference, a lack of infrastructure and questioned the readiness of residents and ratepayers to embrace change.\n\nThe mess, he said, must be blamed on a 2013 directive by the Local Government ministry to pardon debts amounting to US$300 million, owed to council.\n\nAnother directive to award bosses at local authorities hefty allowances was also fingered as another reason for the financial woes facing CoH.\n\nBoth affected his tenure, he alleged.\n\nThe ex-premier highlighted that had those directives not been issued, at least US$2 billion would have been realised by council.\n\nAdded Manyenyeni: This was close to 30 months revenues  with zero compensation from the government.\n\nHCC has not yet recovered from both the direct and indirect pains of those ministerial signatures.\n\nMy own estimate is that the indirect costs of just those two directives add another US$2 billion minimum hemorrhage to Harare City Council.\n\nUntil there is convergence of power with willpower in what must be done, there is no room for positive dreams for the city.\n\nNightmares will be the order of the broad day. Until the key ingredients of running even a normal city are restored, forget about a world-class city.\n\nManyenyeni further poked holes into the dream by questioning the manner of governance at Town House where top officials continue facing arrests on spurious allegations of corruption, abuse of office and various other crimes.\n\nHe mocked it, saying CoH could just be targeting a world record.\n\nMunicipalities draw a lot of support from the goodwill they carry, he said.\n\nHCC has a poor record, world record loading. Among other sore red flags, you cannot imagine any capital city whose Mayors and Town Clerks have been arrested in office more than the Zimbabwe capital in the last 20 years.\n\nIn our media age, how many negative stories pop up when anything about Harare City Council is searched on the web? How many good ones?\n\nLet the dead dream be buriedI shed no tears.\n\n",

His argument is that he was not served with a letter of dismissal, he only saw the letter on social media, said COZWA.\n\nCOZWA proceeded to make sensational claims that the polices Support Unit, Alpha Troop had been put on standby to forcibly remove him from office.\n\nNational police spokesperson, Commissioner Paul Nyathi was not picking calls when NewZimbabwe.com reached out to him inorder to shed light on the matter.\n\nHowever, an invitation from Nyathis office calling on journalists to attend a handover-and-takeover ceremony on January 3, 2025, circulated Thursday, seemingly conveniently timed to diffuse reports of the unfolding drama at PGHQ. The historic event will take place at Mukushi Depot, formerly Morris Depot this Friday.\n\nMatanga took over from Augustine Chihuri, who fled the country after the November 2017 coup that toppled late President Robert Mugabe before President Emmerson Mnangagwa assumed office.\n\nChihuri was perceived to have been a member of Zanu PFs losing G40 faction whose members also fled and are now scattered across the region.\n\n",

At one point, it had one of the highest lion population densities in Africa, according to African Parks.\n\nMurombedzi said the boy used his knowledge of the wild and survival skills to stay alive.\n\nTinotenda survived his ordeal by eating wild fruit. He also dug small wells into dry riverbeds with a stick to access drinking water  a skill taught in the drought-prone area.\n\nMembers of the local Nyaminyami community started a search party and beat drums each day to try and guide him back home.\n\nBut ultimately, it was park rangers who managed to find him.\n\nOn his fifth day in the wild, Tinotenda heard a rangers car and ran toward it, narrowly missing it, the MP said.\n\nLuckily, the rangers returned, spotted fresh little human footprints, and searched the area until they found him.\n\nThis was probably his last chance of being rescued after 5 days in the wilderness, said the MP.\n\nThe park is over 1,470 sq km (570 sq miles) and is home to zebras, elephants, hippos, lions and antelope.\n\nAcross social media, people have been praising the young boy for his resilience.\n\nThis is beyond human comprehension, one person wrote on X.\n\nAnother user wrote: Hes going to have one hell of a story to tell when he gets back to school.\n\n",
