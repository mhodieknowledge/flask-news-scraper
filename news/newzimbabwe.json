            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nRescue workers are racing to save lives and repair damage wrought by Tropical Cyclone Chido in a string of islands across the southwestern Indian Ocean.\n\nThe official death toll in the French territory of Mayotte, an archipelago off the coast of Mozambique that was hit the hardest, was 22 as of Tuesday morning, along with 1 400 injuries, local official Ambdilwahedou Soumaila told Radio France Internationale. But authorities say the number of dead is likely to rise into the hundreds in the worst storm to hit the area in nearly a century.\n\nFrance instituted a curfew from 10 pm to 4 am local time starting Tuesday and President Emmanuel Macron said he would travel to Mayotte in coming days and decree a day of national mourning, while the US State Department has said its ready to offer assistance.\n\nFrances interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, arrived in the capital Mamoudzou on Monday, as the nation rushed hundreds of soldiers and firefighters to assist in recovery efforts. He said the island is totally devastated\n\nThe storm developed in the Indian Ocean from Dec. 7 to 8, hitting Agalega, a dependency located 1,000 kilometers north of Mauritius on December 11, before intensifying north of Madagascar, slamming into the French territory of Mayotte and making landfall in Mozambique on Sunday.\n\nChido hit Mauritius Agalega atoll last Wednesday at more than 200 kilometers per hour, a force that damaged equipment designed to record wind speed, Mauritius Prime Minister Navinchandra Ramgoolam told lawmakers Tuesday. The islands are home to an India-financed and constructed airstrip and jetty.\n\nApproximately 95% of buildings including homes, the hospital, the police and the national coast guards facilities in the north island have been destroyed, he said in response to a parliamentary question. Around 98% of the infrastructure are completely damaged in the south of the island.\n\nThere were no casualties, he said.\n\nThe storm then hit the densely populated Mayotte. Around one-third of the territorys 320,000 residents live in shantytowns, whose sheet-metal roofs are vulnerable to high winds. Mayotte is Frances poorest territory and is heavily dependent on aid from Paris.\n\nChido made landfall in northern Mozambique on Dec. 15 south of Pemba port, dumping more than 250 millimeters of rain in 24 hours. At least 34 people died, with more than 35,000 houses completely or partially destroyed, according to a preliminary assessment from the southeast African nations disaster management institute on Tuesday.\n\nThe storm weakened as it moved inland and will dissipate near Zimbabwe later on Tuesday, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in a report.\n\nMozambique has been rocked by weeks of protests against what opposition leader Venncio Mondlane said were fraudulent elections on Oct. 9. Mondlane was set to announce a new round of demonstrations on Monday, but Chidos wreckage prompted him to postpone these until December 23, by when the Constitutional Council is due to validate the election results.\n\n",

The foreign currency shortages in the region continued resulting in significant payment delays in Zambia and Malawi, he said.\n\nHe said during the period, the group had a difficult year and was not able to deliver the expected level of financial performance as the ongoing transformation of the business was severely impacted by the changes in the economic environment.\n\nThe bold and defensive decisions taken to scale back investment in the Paper segment during the year resulted in significant losses in the Paper divisions after taking into account once-off restructuring costs and under-recoveries.\n\nThe energy storage, timber and stationery businesses delivered resilient performances as they remain foundationally strong but power shortages during the period exacerbated product availability challenges in the peak season.\n\nRevenue for the year decreased by 11% from the prior year due to product availability challenges and the deliberate scaling down of Paper production.\n\nGross profit margins at 44% improved by 2 percentage points benefiting from the change in sales mix with the slowdown of the low-margin paper volumes. Operating expenses increased as currency movements drove service providers to move to hard currency and hedge against further value loss.\n\nThe Group was relentless in its drive to fix, strengthen and reposition the business. Overall short-term bank debt was reduced substantially as proceeds from property disposals were applied towards loans. Finance costs remained relatively high, reducing by 6% from the prior year.\n\nWe anticipate that the market conditions will remain unpredictable and challenging as the underlying economic problems are being addressed.\n\nThe Board remains confident that the ongoing restructuring efforts and decisions taken will see the gradual strengthening of the Group and increased agility in taking of opportunities identified in all our business units, added Wushe.\n\n",

It is a fundamentally discriminatory law. It criminalises the victim and that on its own is problematic so you (women) must grab the bull by the horns and confront the courts on a real argument, he said.\n\nEdna Masiiwa the director of Women Action Group said the law is outdated having been enacted in 1977.\n\nIt is a law that does not serve todays woman, she said.\n\nZimbabwean abortion law is currently highly restrictive, with stringent requirements for the limited grounds on which abortion is allowed, based on very archaic legislation enacted in Rhodesia with no contemporary proven benefit for women and society at large.\n\nDespite the existence of permissible circumstances for abortion outlined in the Termination of Pregnancy Act, access to safe and legal abortion remains a challenge for many women, especially the rural and poor given the strenuous legal and administrative barriers.\n\n",
