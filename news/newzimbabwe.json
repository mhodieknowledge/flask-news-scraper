            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nJustice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi told the National Assembly on Wednesday that there is no law prohibiting tinted vehicle windows.\n\nHis remarks followed an announcement by Presidential Secretary Tafadzwa Muguti claiming that tinting had been banned, which sparked confusion and questions from legislators seeking clarification on the legal framework behind the directive.\n\nDuring the Question and Answer session, Zanu PF Zvimba East MP Kudakwashe Mananzva asked, We heard that it is now a criminal offence to tint car windows. Is it illegal to put some tint on your car?\n\nIn response, Ziyambi clarified: The law allows tinting on a vehicle, provided it does not obstruct the drivers clear line of vision. For side windows, we have not yet reached a final agreement together with Hon. (Felix) Mhona, Hon. (Kazembe Kazembe), and other stakeholders.\n\nDangamvura-Chikanga MP Prosper Mutseyami pressed further, asking whether Mugutis announcement represented government policy or his personal opinion.\n\nZiyambi stressed that only Information Minister Jenfan Muswere, Information Secretary Nick Mangwana, and Presidential Spokesperson George Charamba are authorised to speak on behalf of government. The moment someone speaks on behalf of the whole government without that authority, it becomes a mistake,he said.\n\nKuwadzana East MP Charlton Hwende revealed that some drivers had been fined by police following Mugutis announcement.\n\nZiyambi responded: There is no policeman who enforces social media announcements without a Statutory Instrument. Policemen enforce the law by quoting Statutory Instruments. If anyone was given a ticket, they have the right to go to court, and the court will take corrective measures. Our policemen are orderly; they do not do that.\n\nMP Gladys Hlatywayo questioned how government planned to address the policy discord that had caused confusion and public outcry. Ziyambi replied that the role of MPs was to provide oversight, not to set policy.\n\nEarlier, Charamba took to X (formerly Twitter) to clarify that Mugutis announcement was a miscommunication by an unauthorised official.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nPolice in Limpopo have arrested a 51-year-old Zimbabwean man who had been on the run after a violent love triangle turned deadly at Wegdraai Village, Maleboho.\n\nOn Wednesday morning,IOL reported thatthe horrific incident occurred on Monday at around 11 pm.\n\nThe suspect, who is the elder brother of a 20-year-old man arrested earlier this week, was cornered in the Alldays policing area on Tuesday night while attempting to flee the country.\n\nProvincial police spokesperson Colonel Malesela Ledwaba confirmed the arrest: The suspect, who had been on the run, was arrested at about 9 pm after he was found hiding in a truck headed towards Zimbabwe. Upon arrival, he was found carrying a bag of clothes in an attempt to flee the country. Like his younger brother, he was also found to be in the country illegally.\n\nThe case stems from the violent confrontation late on Monday after the brothers allegedly received information that the 55-year-old victim was romantically involved with the elder brothers girlfriend. They stormed into a homestead where the victim and a 38-year-old woman were present.\n\nOn arrival, a confrontation ensued, during which the elder brother allegedly attacked the man with an axe and severely injured the woman, said Ledwaba.\n\nParamedics certified the 55-year-old man dead at the scene, while the injured woman was rushed to hospital for urgent treatment.\n\nPolice swiftly arrested the younger brother at his home, where they recovered the bloodied axe, which he had allegedly tried to wash in an effort to destroy evidence. He was also confirmed to be an undocumented foreign national.\n\nBoth suspects  aged 20 and 51  face charges of murder, attempted murder, defeating the ends of justice, and contravention of the Immigration Act. They are scheduled to appear before the Senwabarwa Magistrates Court on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile,Limpopos provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe,welcomed the swift arrest and applauded community members for helping police track down the fugitive.\n\nThis was a brutal act of violence. We call upon communities to continue working closely with the police. We will not tolerate such despicable behaviour, and no one is above the law, said Hadebe.\n\n",

            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo | IOL\n\nAdvocate Dali Mpofu, a senior member of theuMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party led by former president Jacob Zuma, has castigated deepening divisions among Africans, and called for development on the continent and the free movement of people.\n\nThe seasoned legal counsel was speaking at the launch ofZimbabwean veteran opposition politician Job Sikhalas book, Footprints in the Chains: The Life Story of Job Sikhala, in Johannesburg. Zimbabwean journalist and commentator Hopewell Chinono also attended and addressed the event.\n\nThe guest of honour at the Joburg event,Mozambican main opposition leader Venncio Mondlane, was allegedly blocked by Mozambican authorities from attending physically, but he addressed the event virtually.\n\nIn his address, Mpofu said Africans today are heavily dividedalong lines they cannot explain.\n\nIn the song (that was sung at the book launch event) somebody was talking about makwerekwere (a commonly used derogatory slur in South Africa against foreign nationals, particularly those from other African countries). We have allowed ourselves to be divided along lines that we also cannot even explain ourselves, said Mpofu.\n\nHow can we havemakwerekwerehere in Africa? Just tell me, how many people know that people of Matabeleland actually come from here? The entire Matabeleland  they come from here literally.\n\nMatabeleland is a vast region in southwestern Zimbabwe, named after the indigenous Ndebele people who reside there. It is divided into three modern-day provinces: Matabeleland North, Matabeleland South, and the city-province of Bulawayo.\n\nMpofu also referred to the sharing of languages among different groups of Africans found in different nations.\n\nThat is not a coincidence, we do not ask ourselves why? Why is that so? It is becauseMziilikaziwho moved from here, is the same person who was fighting alongside Shaka, and this is not a long time ago. It is less than 200 years ago. In historical terms, that is not a long time.\n\nBecause of those wars, Mzilikazi actually moved from what we call KZN (KwaZulu-Natal) now and lived here, in Gauteng, for a long time until the so-called Voortrekkers came and then it is only then that he moved across the Limpopo. So the very same people, who 200 years ago were sitting together in KZN are now calling each other  this one is makwerekwere. We must wake up as Africans, we really must, said the former chairperson of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF).\n\nHe said oppressors have used borders to divide Africans.\n\nWe worship things that have been imposed on us. Who came up with the borders? Was it us? In 1884 there was a meeting in Germany with white people only, not a single African. Not one African, I think even the people that were serving tea were white. And those people decided to cut our continent into pieces as they liked.\n\nIf my village and Jobs village, if they decided and cut it, he is now in another country and I am now in another country. They didnt care, they were cutting it according to the riches of the continent, said Mpofu.\n\nWhy is it that in the United States, you have 51 states and can move around without borders? Why are we as Africans not asking those questions? The answer is this: the only reason we are fighting is that we are not economically developing our continent.\n\nMpofu said if Africa was developing as a continent, there would be no need for the extensive restrictions on peoples movement.\n\nPeople do not move because they hate their homes. They move because of economic factors. That happens everywhere. I am here because of economic factors. I come from the Eastern Cape. So you can call me kwerekwere as well, said Mpofu.\n\n",

During the liberation struggle, many Zimbabweans settled in Mozambican territory, especially in the central province of Manica, where both countries share a border.\n\nAccording to Levi  who was speaking to reporters on Monday, in Maputo, minutes after the end of a courtesy meeting granted to Zimbabwes Deputy President, Kembo Dugish Mohadi  the Deputy President came to Mozambique on a mission related to the monuments built in Mozambique to commemorate the deaths of Zimbabwean citizens.\n\nThe Prime Minister explained that the Zimbabwean mission will be accompanied by experts, including archaeologists, who will gather the necessary information to provide Zimbabweans with more information about their historical journey towards independence.\n\nMohadi, for his part, said that during the meeting, both countries discussed several issues, highlighting concern for creating better conditions for both peoples, Mozambicans and Zimbabweans.\n\nWe also discussed what we should do to improve the lives of our people economically; and we emphasized that, yes, we have our independence, we have our parliaments, we have our judiciary.

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nA PARLIAMENTARY Public Accounts Committee (PAC) analysis report has revealed that government lost millions of United States (US) dollars due to collusion between the Zimbabwe National Road Administration (ZINARA) officials and truck drivers at the border posts.\n\nPAC conducted an analysis of the Zimbabwe National Road\n\nAdministration (ZINARA) based on the findings of the Auditor Generals report on State-Owned Enterprises and Parastatals for the year ended December 31, 2023.\n\nThe analysis which exposed rampant corruption at ZINARA was crucial for ensuring transparency and accountability in the management of public resources.\n\nThe Auditor General reported that ZINARA improperly released 11 vehicles with ZWL $10.1 million in unpaid overload fees due to a lack of policies without any evidence of payment plans or proof of payment.\n\nThe PAC Committee, in its analysis, noted with concern the high risk of revenue loss due to potential collusion between truck owners and ZINARA officials, as evidenced by the improper release of the 11 vehicles.\n\nZINARA Finance Director, Adam Zvandasara, informed the Committee that the Vehicle Inspection Department (VID) acts as ZINARAs agent for the collection of abnormal, overload, and transit fees. The overload fees were determined and paid at VID.\n\nAccording to Zvandasara, if overloaded vehicles cannot pay on the spot, they are referred to ZINARA for payment plans. ZINARA reviews the paperwork to determine whether to release the vehicle upon fulfilment of the payment plan, with the Finance department signing off on the payment plan and following up on recovery.\n\nTo date, 52% (ZWL $5,284,507,00) of the outstanding amount has been recovered, leaving a balance of ZWL $4,964,363.50. Efforts to recover the remaining amount are ongoing, Zvandasara told the Committee during an oral evidence hearing session, read part of the PAC analysis report.\n\nAlso among the raised issues by the AGs report was the tollgate evasion, where road users bypassed tollgates using unauthorised routes.\n\nThe Committee noted that the manual system used by ZINARA was prone to corruption, as evidenced by the supervisors delayed submission of evasion lists.\n\nZINARA is transitioning from manual to automated flagging.\n\nWhile the manual system provided an audit trail, the new system ensures greater accuracy and accountability.\n\nCCTV cameras are used to validate data on flagged vehicles. The delay in migration was due to the complexity of system development and continuous improvement requests, the Committee analysis report showed.\n\nThe committee had recommended that the ZINARA Board should investigate the supervisors conduct and submit findings by the end of July 2025.\n\nIt also recommended that ZINARA should install a computerised system for recording tollgate evasions by August 2025, with evasion lists submitted to the Auditor General within one week of flagging\n\nAnother concern, regarding the Auditor Generals report, involved transit coupons where the Eskbank Tollgate had obsolete transit coupons, last used in 2018, which were not recorded in the register.\n\nThe coupons lacked security features and were intended for manual ticketing during system downtime.\n\nZvandasara highlighted that the manual coupons were historically used during power outages or system failures.\n\nPAC noted the risk of pilferage due to the lack of security features on the transit coupons.\n\nZINARA should introduce regular spot checks to ensure system integrity beginning 31 October 2025.\n\nIt should also implement additional security measures for transit coupons by 31 October 2025, read part of the PAC analysis report.\n\n",
