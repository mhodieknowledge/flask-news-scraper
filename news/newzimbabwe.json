I thank my support staff and most of all the players and their families who supported them through this journey.\n\nSince his appointment last year in March, Benade has remained unbeaten in all the matches he has played.\n\nHe added that he is now looking forward to the challenge that is ahead.\n\nIts a challenge to take on.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA Harare pastor has been spared from serving a 20-year jail term after the High Court quashed his conviction and sentence, having found that the lower court erred in finding him guilty.\n\nJeane Pierre Dusabe was jailed by a Harare magistrate for allegedly raping and indecently assaulting a minor girl he took custody of after her parents divorced back in 2014.\n\nThe rape only emerged ten years later, when the girl got married, with a formal report being made later in 2023.\n\nThe court heard, Dusabe was aged 39 while the girl was aged 12 years when the offence was allegedly committed.\n\nThe allegations in count one were that the appellant indecently assaulted the complainant once at a house in Harare.\n\nOn the second count, it was alleged that on dates unknown to the prosecutor between the years 2014 and 2022 and at different places in Harare and Masvingo, the appellant hadsexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent on several occasions.\n\nDusabe was charged with one count of rape and another of indecent assault.\n\nThe complainantstestimony was that sometime in 2014 Dusabe touched her private parts when her aunt was away on a trip to South Africa.\n\nShe was having swimming lessons conducted by Dusabe in a pool at her home in Mandara, together with her sister, who was also a minor.\n\nOn the same day, around midnight, the appellant came into the room, got into the blankets, and got on top of her.\n\nShe awoke to find the appellant on top of her before he raped her while covering her mouth.\n\nShe said after this incident, the appellant had sexual intercourse with her without her consent several times at different homes they stayed in.\n\nShe also said sometime in 2015 on unknown dates and in Hateld, the appellant would occasionally transport her to and from school using his commuter omnibus. It is alleged that during these times, the appellant would take advantage of the complainant and have sexual intercourse with her without her consent at a bushy area in Arlington.\n\nThe complainant also told the court a quo that sometime in March 2022, on an unknown date, she fell sick and sought the appellants help.\n\nShe said Dusabe suggested to her that they go to Masvingo to a doctor whom he knew who could treat her.\n\nWhilst there, Dusabe had sexual intercourse with her four times without her consent, after his relatives, whom they had found at his house, had left for Harare.\n\nThe alleged rape only surfaced after her husband confronted her over her virginity when they got married.\n\nShe told her that Dusabe had raped her several times.\n\nThe husband then told church members in 2022 but a formal report was made two years later.\n\nThe trial court found Dusabe guilty of rape and indecent assault before sentencing him to 20 years imprisonment.\n\nAggrieved, he mounted the present application, complaining that the lower court erred in convicting him when there was no evidence linking him to the alleged crimes.\n\nDusabe proved that his wife never visited South Africa in 2014 by producing her passport.\n\nThree relatives testified that Dusabe never resided at a house with a functional swimming pool.\n\nHis lawyer said the lower court was wrong in finding that the delay in reporting the rape was reasonable when one considers the manner in which the offence surfaced and material discrepancies in the evidence of the complainant.\n\nHe also said the alleged rape in Masvingo took place when the complainant was already married and that she failed to disclose it, then was therefore unreasonable.\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Christopher Dube Banda upheld Dusabes appeal, ruling that the report of rape does not meet the requirements for admissibility.\n\nThe trial court erred in failing to make findings on material aspects of the case.\n\nThe delay in reporting the alleged rape and indecent assault and the circumstances under which the disclosure was made render the complaint doubtful and unreasonable.\n\nConsequently, the State evidence led is not reliable and safe to convict on.\n\nThe appellants story is convincing.\n\nThe State failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe evidence that was placed before the court did not meet the required threshold when regard is had to the evidence of the State witnesses.\n\nOn that basis, this court is obliged to interfere with the findings of the trial court.\n\nThe evidence being unreliable, it was unsafe to convict the appellant on its basis.\n\nAccordingly, the court finds that the States concession was properly made. The appeal succeeds. As a result, it is ordered that the appeal against both conviction and sentence is upheld.\n\nThe court a quos conviction and sentence be and is hereby set aside and in its place is substituted the following; The accused is found not guilty and acquitted, the judge ruled.\n\n",
