It was registered on 28 August 2012.\n\nHowever, allegations are that despite a protracted legal battle which saw the Supreme Court order of 6 February 2025 recognising Tecla Barangwe as the legitimate leader of MPAWUZ, Rigava, in his capacity as the NEC Medical chairperson, has teamed up with other top officials to block the trade unionist.\n\nWe suspect that he is well aware of the surging MPAWUZ membership and the possibility of Barangwe eventually taking over the NEC Medicals helm, asource at the NEC Medical told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nA letter dated June 19, 2025, written by the Labour Ministrys acting registrar M.T Maphaka seen by NewZimbabwe.com, revealed that Rigava has defied the governments directive on the matter.\n\nThe NECs defence that Barangwe could not be co-opted into NEC because the accreditation process for the year 2025 had lapsed was dismissed as inferior after the industry organs failure to produce evidence on how the framework is applied.\n\nSubsequently, the Director of Labour Administration Mr Vusani wrote requesting documents used in accreditation proceedings and remains unanswered by the NEC, said Maphaka.\n\nIn any case, the Ministry emphasised that none of these issues raised above supersedes or diminishes the authority of the Supreme Court Judgment, which explicitly recognises Ms Barangwe as the rightful leader of MPAWUZ and grants her authority to represent the union and its members in NEC meetings.\n\nBy this letter, the NEC is hereby directed to ensure that the legitimate leadership of MPAWUZ is recognised and accorded due representation in the NEC. Your prompt attention to the matter will be highly appreciated, the Ministry ordered.\n\nContacted for comment, Rigava initially developed cold feet and directed the publication to another official at the NEC Medical.\n\nIam away. Urgently talk to Mr Mutukwa. He will handle your questions, he said.\n\nAfter being pressed further to respond to the matter in his capacity as the NEC Medical chairperson, he said, NEC Medical has been to court on the same allegations and was found not guilty.\n\n",
