Management is hopeful the Authorities will continue to intervene in this matter to promote fair competition in the operating environment, said the company.\n\nDuring the period, Farm & City Centre (FCC) sales volumes increased by 9% compared to the comparative period prior year on the back of the agro sectors rebound following the prior years drought.\n\nNotwithstanding increased competition, the entity continued to enjoy the fruits of mutually beneficial relations with its suppliers for key revenue drivers, which have continued to guarantee the businesss stability. The entity continues to implement enhanced product diversification strategies.\n\nIn the same reporting period, Agrifoods sales volumes increased by 13.9% during the quarter against a comparative prior year period, attributable to improved aggregate demand for its products.\n\nManagement remains focused on growing Agrifoods market share notwithstanding increased competition in the feed sector. The business remains responsive to evolving market dynamics and customer needs, with focused engagement and adaptive strategies deployed across operations.\n\nDuring the quarter, Victoria Foods sales volumes declined by 3% compared to the same period the prior year, influenced by grain shortages caused by the drought from the prior year and the late start of the maize harvest.\n\nGoing forward, the Group anticipates the FY2025 economic outturn to remain challenging, influenced by liquidity constraints and reduced aggregate demand. Ongoing cost containment measures will continue to be implemented, added CFI.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nA Political analyst has said Julius Malemas call for Zimbabweans in South Africa to seek employment in their home country signals a policy shift to align the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) with the aspirations and interests of the majority of South Africans.\n\nAddressing supporters at an EFF rally in Seshego, Limpopo, over the weekend, Malemastressed that South Africans must be prioritised for job opportunities, particularly within local municipalities.\n\nMalema emphasised that while Zimbabweans are welcome in South Africa, it is unjust for locals to be sidelined in their communities.\n\nWhen we say we want jobs where we pay for services, we are not saying we dont want Zimbabweans. We are saying we should be given first preference before everyone else to get jobs,Malema said.\n\nWe dont disagree that Zimbabweans should be given jobs, but they should be given jobs in their municipalities in Harare and other areas, so we have opportunities to get jobs in our municipalities.\n\nMalemasremarks come amid ongoing controversy in the Polokwane Municipality, where Mayor John Mpe has been accused of awarding tenders to foreign-owned companies, including one allegedly linked to a Zimbabwean partner of municipal manager Thuso Nemugumoni.\n\nMpe denied the allegations and defended the municipalitys procurement processes, stating that there is nothing unlawful about awarding tenders to foreign-owned companies if they comply with the law.\n\nKenneth Mokgatlhe, a political analyst and commentator, weighed in on the apparent EFF policy shift: Although this is not the first time Malema made similar remarks regarding the Zimbabwean question, this was the most direct address from him to them. In the past, he would tell them to go and vote to fix their situation.\n\nHe and his party had previously claimed that foreigners are not really stealing jobs from South Africans. We now know from [former EFF deputy Floyd] Shivambu that Malema did not engage his fellow executives on the immigration policy, which was responsible for their electoral decline in the past general elections.\n\nMokgatlhe said that there were now more voices which many disgruntled South Africans are associating with against illegal immigration.\n\nFor you to stay relevant and speak to the issues affecting the electorate, you have to tell them what they want to hear. He knows that he fumbled, but his ego wont let him come to the public and acknowledge weakness on his side, Mokgatlhe said.\n\nHe would rather silently make a policy shift to align his party with the aspirations and interests of the majority of South Africans. The EFF will not afford to ignore or speak against its citizens because immigration is one of the immediate global challenges for most countries that are stable in the world.\n\nHowever, Malema insisted that government projects funded by taxpayers must benefit South Africans first.\n\nHis comments take on greater significance against the backdrop of South Africas staggering youth unemployment crisis.\n\nAccording to recent statistics, 62.4% of young people aged 15 to 24 are unemployed, with the broader youth unemployment rate for those aged 15 to 34 sitting at 46.1%. For the 25 to 34 age group, the unemployment rate is 40.4%.\n\nThese figures, which have steadily worsened over the past decade, have raised alarms among economists and labour experts, who warn that the country is facing a generation excluded from economic participation.\n\nMalema said that it is unacceptable for South Africans to remain jobless while foreign nationals receive tenders and employment through municipal structures. He urged communities to resist and question such decisions and to demand accountability from local leaders.\n\nHis latest comments signal a shift from his earlier stance on foreign nationals and open border policy.\n\nIn 2022, Malema had defended the right of Zimbabweans to work in South Africa, while still calling for locals to be prioritised.\n\nWe want Zimbabweans to work in SA. They should make no apologies about hiring Zimbabweans or any other African brother or sister. But they must be considerate that there are locals who must at all times be given preference, he said at the time.\n\nIn previous years, Malema has also spoken out against xenophobia and expressed support for Pan-African unity.\n\nDuring a Heritage Day address in 2022, he urged South Africans not to discriminate against Zimbabweans or other African migrants.\n\nWe must never speak about heritage but refuse to want Zimbabweans or any person from another African country. You will see a Zimbabwean and see an African  this is my brother, this is my sister, he said.\n\nHe also encouraged Zimbabwean nationals in South Africa to participate in their countrys democratic process, even offering buses to transport them home to vote. Malema went as far as urging Zimbabweans to vote out the ruling ZANU-PF party, which he accused of plunging the country into economic ruin.\n\nHowever, another political commentator, Anda Mbikwana, cautioned: While political leaders often express their views within the broader context of national policy and sovereignty, such statements must be approached with both sensitivity and a commitment to regional unity.\n\nMigration across our borders is a complex issue, rooted in economic, social, and historical dynamics that require thoughtful, humane, and collaborative solutions, Mbikwana said.\n\nAny discourse on the matter should avoid fuelling division or xenophobia and instead focus on sustainable development, mutual support, and inclusive growth across the region.\n\n",

The absence of law enforcement has turned bus ranks into zones of terror. Women and girls are no longer safe. The governments efforts to curb tout activity remain inconsistent and ineffective.\n\n",
