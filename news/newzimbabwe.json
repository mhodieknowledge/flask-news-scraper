            "content": "By James Muonwa\n\nTHE lenient sentence handed a 20-year-old unlicenced driver, who ran over and killed a Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) student, has elicited mixed reactions from the court of public opinion.\n\nCUTs School of Hospitality and Tourism student, Tanatswa Chinyama (21), tragically lost her life while four other students were left nursing varying degrees of injuries following the accident on the fateful morning of November 17, 2024, near the railway crossing adjacent Sips Bar, Chinhoyi.Takudzwa Gwenzi, the man behind the steering wheel, was spared a custodial sentence when he recently appeared before Chinhoyi Magistrate Kudzanai Kapurura facing three charges; culpable homicide, driving without a drivers licence and negligent driving.The court found Gwenzi guilty of all charges and sentenced him to 24 months improvement with six months suspended for three years. The remaining 18 months were set aside on the condition that he performs 360 hours of community service.During court proceedings prior to sentencing, defendants lawyer, Knight Tafadzwa Rwodzi put up a spirited argument to keep his client out of prison.He argued that in the circumstances, the degree of negligence was moderate or ordinary considering the accident happened around 4am when visibility was still poor and the pedestrians, who are also victims, were not wearing reflective clothing.Rwodzi further submitted that a truck approaching from the opposite direction flashed its headlamps to high beam hence reduced his clients vision.The intense dazzling light from this truck caused a temporary blindness culminating into the accident, the defence lawyer submitted in court.The lawyer also averred that the victims were themselves negligent.The victims were walking and some standing in the midst of the road thereby obstructing the accused to enjoy his right of way. If these pedestrians intended to cross the road, they should have done so on designated crossing point or when it was safe to do so, Rwodzi said.The victims are all adults, and greater care was expected of them whenever they walk on public roads.The accident having happened closer to Sips Bar at around 0400hours, there is highly likelihood that these pedestrians were drunk as they were standing in the midst of the road.In mitigation, Rwodzi expressed remorse that a life was lost while the other parties suffered injuries due to the actions of his youthful client, now a vendor orphaned in childhood hence lacked strict parental guidance.He is of youthful age, that is 20 years, not married and no kids. He is a first time offender, who readily admits the charges and should be treated differently from those who deny and found guilty after a full-fledged trial.He lost his mother when he was still a teenager and he was taken care of by his maternal grandmother whom with age, might not have taken a firm grip in nurturing him into a responsible adult person.Court also heard that Gwenzi was full of guilt for causing a persons death and injuring four others.Ever since he committed this offence, his entire life is full of guilt and he sometimes attempts to commit suicide. He is also a victim of this incident as he needs to undergo extensive counselling, said the defence counsel.He added that Gwenzi displayed Ubuntu when he contributed money towards the now deceaseds funeral and medical expenses for the injured.He showed contrition for committing the offence and assisted the deceaseds family with a sum of US$500, which they accepted.he pledged to buy beasts in the name of sacrificial offering for the lost soul, further submitted the lawyer, before pleading with the magistrate to impose a fine or community service.In the aftermath of the sentencing, social media was inundated with mixed reactions with some frowning upon the lenient sentence while others felt Gwenzi, being a young offender, was supposed to be given a second chance.Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) legal counsel Rutendo Mudarikwa said the sentence was in sync with the diversion route the justice system had adopted to keep young first-time offenders out of prison.The courts are wary of passing custodial sentences to young offenders who dont have previous criminal records.In this instance, although negligent driving caused a fatality, the court pursued the diversion route so that young offenders are spared imprisonment. Its a balancing act, said Mudarikwa.A renowned Chinhoyi-based lawyer, who requested anonymity, told NewZimbabwe.com that courts consider various factors when determining sentences, hence the public must be aware of mitigating circumstances that could result in passing of lighter, non-custodial sentences.Generally sentencing is discretionary on the part of the sentencing court and is a result of a consideration of several factors which include (i) the nature and circumstances of the case (ii) the personal circumstances of the accused and (iii) societys interests (retribution), said the lawyer, who preferred anonymity.Now in this case, the offender was youthful, and maybe a first offender, who should be spared the rigours of imprisonment hence he may be turned into a criminal if sent to jail and learn from hardcore criminals.Further, in culpable homicide one is punished for negligence which carries lighter consequences than cases to do with intention. A fine or community service are available for culpable homicide.What accounted in favour of the offender is his youthfulness and being a first offender. The penal justice system seeks to rehabilitate and only punish when rehabilitation has failed, added the top legal practitioner.Another revered lawyer, Mike Mutsvairo of Mushonga-Mutsvairo & Associates, opined that the offender was driving without a valid drivers licence hence this alone aggravated the circumstances.On a charge and conviction of culpable homicide arising out of a driving offence where an accused was driving without a drivers licence, the sentence ranges from imprisonment for life, a shorter prison term, a fine or both.The absence of a drivers licence aggravates the offence so is the running away from the scene. So, the trial court must first make a finding on the degree of negligence before assessing the appropriate sentence S v Chitepo 2017 (1) ZLR 237 H and Manhenga vs S, HH-62-15, said Mutsvairo.The finding must be anchored on a sound factual basis. If this was not done then the sentence imposed would not be in accordance with justice. If it was and going by the summary of facts by the NPA (National Prosecuting Authority), my view is that the accused should have been found guilty of gross negligence or recklessnessRecklessness in traffic cases means no more than gross or aggravated form of negligence or where the driving shows a complete or wilful disregard for the safety as well as rights of other road users.Loss of life due to an accident is an aggravating factor, so are the injuries suffered by the other four (4), which are likely to be serious and permanent.Absence of a drivers licence is a separate offence and adds to the seriousness of the culpable homicide charge. So is running away from the scene of the accident. This would point to imprisonment being the appropriate punishment, said the top lawyer.Any other sentence would only come into play if there are special circumstances that made the accused drive the vehicle, for example driving under duress or having a medical emergency e.g. transporting someone with a life-threatening medical condition to hospital.If there were no special circumstances, the sentence imposed fails to recognise the seriousness of the crime and society loses its confidence in the criminal justice system, especially in a society where fatal road accidents have become prevalent and endemic.The facts as narrated by the NPA shows that a deterrent sentence was necessary. The accused can consider himself extremely fortunate that he was treated with such excessive leniency.The sentence is disturbingly inappropriate and not in accordance with the requirements of the law. It is not in accordance with real and substantial justice and the NPA ought to file an appeal against the sentence imposed unless if there are facts warranting the sentence imposed that were not made public, said the senior counsel.The Passengers Association of Zimbabwe (PAZ) described the ruling as woefully inadequate and deeply unjust.We are appalled by a justice system that seems to prioritise the perpetrator over the victims, effectively rendering the latter invisible and voiceless.This ruling perpetuates the notion that the lives of ordinary citizens, particularly the vulnerable, are of little value, said PAZ national coordinator Tafadzwa Golaiti.PAZ is lobbying for an appeal of the ruling, as well as a broader review of how road traffic fatalities are prosecuted.We demand a more just and equitable outcome that acknowledges the gravity of this tragic incident and holds the perpetrator accountable, said Goliati.The Ministry of Justice as well as Parliament were urged to address what PAZ terms systemic failures in the legal handling of road traffic crimes.\n\nCUTs School of Hospitality and Tourism student, Tanatswa Chinyama (21), tragically lost her life while four other students were left nursing varying degrees of injuries following the accident on the fateful morning of November 17, 2024, near the railway crossing adjacent Sips Bar, Chinhoyi.\n\nTakudzwa Gwenzi, the man behind the steering wheel, was spared a custodial sentence when he recently appeared before Chinhoyi Magistrate Kudzanai Kapurura facing three charges; culpable homicide, driving without a drivers licence and negligent driving.The court found Gwenzi guilty of all charges and sentenced him to 24 months improvement with six months suspended for three years.

It is not in accordance with real and substantial justice and the NPA ought to file an appeal against the sentence imposed unless if there are facts warranting the sentence imposed that were not made public, said the senior counsel.The Passengers Association of Zimbabwe (PAZ) described the ruling as woefully inadequate and deeply unjust.We are appalled by a justice system that seems to prioritise the perpetrator over the victims, effectively rendering the latter invisible and voiceless.This ruling perpetuates the notion that the lives of ordinary citizens, particularly the vulnerable, are of little value, said PAZ national coordinator Tafadzwa Golaiti.PAZ is lobbying for an appeal of the ruling, as well as a broader review of how road traffic fatalities are prosecuted.We demand a more just and equitable outcome that acknowledges the gravity of this tragic incident and holds the perpetrator accountable, said Goliati.The Ministry of Justice as well as Parliament were urged to address what PAZ terms systemic failures in the legal handling of road traffic crimes.\n\nThe court found Gwenzi guilty of all charges and sentenced him to 24 months improvement with six months suspended for three years. The remaining 18 months were set aside on the condition that he performs 360 hours of community service.\n\nDuring court proceedings prior to sentencing, defendants lawyer, Knight Tafadzwa Rwodzi put up a spirited argument to keep his client out of prison.He argued that in the circumstances, the degree of negligence was moderate or ordinary considering the accident happened around 4am when visibility was still poor and the pedestrians, who are also victims, were not wearing reflective clothing.Rwodzi further submitted that a truck approaching from the opposite direction flashed its headlamps to high beam hence reduced his clients vision.The intense dazzling light from this truck caused a temporary blindness culminating into the accident, the defence lawyer submitted in court.The lawyer also averred that the victims were themselves negligent.The victims were walking and some standing in the midst of the road thereby obstructing the accused to enjoy his right of way. If these pedestrians intended to cross the road, they should have done so on designated crossing point or when it was safe to do so, Rwodzi said.The victims are all adults, and greater care was expected of them whenever they walk on public roads.The accident having happened closer to Sips Bar at around 0400hours, there is highly likelihood that these pedestrians were drunk as they were standing in the midst of the road.In mitigation, Rwodzi expressed remorse that a life was lost while the other parties suffered injuries due to the actions of his youthful client, now a vendor orphaned in childhood hence lacked strict parental guidance.He is of youthful age, that is 20 years, not married and no kids. He is a first time offender, who readily admits the charges and should be treated differently from those who deny and found guilty after a full-fledged trial.He lost his mother when he was still a teenager and he was taken care of by his maternal grandmother whom with age, might not have taken a firm grip in nurturing him into a responsible adult person.Court also heard that Gwenzi was full of guilt for causing a persons death and injuring four others.Ever since he committed this offence, his entire life is full of guilt and he sometimes attempts to commit suicide. He is also a victim of this incident as he needs to undergo extensive counselling, said the defence counsel.He added that Gwenzi displayed Ubuntu when he contributed money towards the now deceaseds funeral and medical expenses for the injured.He showed contrition for committing the offence and assisted the deceaseds family with a sum of US$500, which they accepted.he pledged to buy beasts in the name of sacrificial offering for the lost soul, further submitted the lawyer, before pleading with the magistrate to impose a fine or community service.In the aftermath of the sentencing, social media was inundated with mixed reactions with some frowning upon the lenient sentence while others felt Gwenzi, being a young offender, was supposed to be given a second chance.Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) legal counsel Rutendo Mudarikwa said the sentence was in sync with the diversion route the justice system had adopted to keep young first-time offenders out of prison.The courts are wary of passing custodial sentences to young offenders who dont have previous criminal records.In this instance, although negligent driving caused a fatality, the court pursued the diversion route so that young offenders are spared imprisonment. Its a balancing act, said Mudarikwa.A renowned Chinhoyi-based lawyer, who requested anonymity, told NewZimbabwe.com that courts consider various factors when determining sentences, hence the public must be aware of mitigating circumstances that could result in passing of lighter, non-custodial sentences.Generally sentencing is discretionary on the part of the sentencing court and is a result of a consideration of several factors which include (i) the nature and circumstances of the case (ii) the personal circumstances of the accused and (iii) societys interests (retribution), said the lawyer, who preferred anonymity.Now in this case, the offender was youthful, and maybe a first offender, who should be spared the rigours of imprisonment hence he may be turned into a criminal if sent to jail and learn from hardcore criminals.Further, in culpable homicide one is punished for negligence which carries lighter consequences than cases to do with intention. A fine or community service are available for culpable homicide.What accounted in favour of the offender is his youthfulness and being a first offender. The penal justice system seeks to rehabilitate and only punish when rehabilitation has failed, added the top legal practitioner.Another revered lawyer, Mike Mutsvairo of Mushonga-Mutsvairo & Associates, opined that the offender was driving without a valid drivers licence hence this alone aggravated the circumstances.On a charge and conviction of culpable homicide arising out of a driving offence where an accused was driving without a drivers licence, the sentence ranges from imprisonment for life, a shorter prison term, a fine or both.The absence of a drivers licence aggravates the offence so is the running away from the scene. So, the trial court must first make a finding on the degree of negligence before assessing the appropriate sentence S v Chitepo 2017 (1) ZLR 237 H and Manhenga vs S, HH-62-15, said Mutsvairo.The finding must be anchored on a sound factual basis. If this was not done then the sentence imposed would not be in accordance with justice. If it was and going by the summary of facts by the NPA (National Prosecuting Authority), my view is that the accused should have been found guilty of gross negligence or recklessnessRecklessness in traffic cases means no more than gross or aggravated form of negligence or where the driving shows a complete or wilful disregard for the safety as well as rights of other road users.Loss of life due to an accident is an aggravating factor, so are the injuries suffered by the other four (4), which are likely to be serious and permanent.Absence of a drivers licence is a separate offence and adds to the seriousness of the culpable homicide charge. So is running away from the scene of the accident.

It is not in accordance with real and substantial justice and the NPA ought to file an appeal against the sentence imposed unless if there are facts warranting the sentence imposed that were not made public, said the senior counsel.The Passengers Association of Zimbabwe (PAZ) described the ruling as woefully inadequate and deeply unjust.We are appalled by a justice system that seems to prioritise the perpetrator over the victims, effectively rendering the latter invisible and voiceless.This ruling perpetuates the notion that the lives of ordinary citizens, particularly the vulnerable, are of little value, said PAZ national coordinator Tafadzwa Golaiti.PAZ is lobbying for an appeal of the ruling, as well as a broader review of how road traffic fatalities are prosecuted.We demand a more just and equitable outcome that acknowledges the gravity of this tragic incident and holds the perpetrator accountable, said Goliati.The Ministry of Justice as well as Parliament were urged to address what PAZ terms systemic failures in the legal handling of road traffic crimes.\n\nThe lawyer also averred that the victims were themselves negligent.\n\nThe victims were walking and some standing in the midst of the road thereby obstructing the accused to enjoy his right of way. If these pedestrians intended to cross the road, they should have done so on designated crossing point or when it was safe to do so, Rwodzi said.The victims are all adults, and greater care was expected of them whenever they walk on public roads.The accident having happened closer to Sips Bar at around 0400hours, there is highly likelihood that these pedestrians were drunk as they were standing in the midst of the road.In mitigation, Rwodzi expressed remorse that a life was lost while the other parties suffered injuries due to the actions of his youthful client, now a vendor orphaned in childhood hence lacked strict parental guidance.He is of youthful age, that is 20 years, not married and no kids. He is a first time offender, who readily admits the charges and should be treated differently from those who deny and found guilty after a full-fledged trial.He lost his mother when he was still a teenager and he was taken care of by his maternal grandmother whom with age, might not have taken a firm grip in nurturing him into a responsible adult person.Court also heard that Gwenzi was full of guilt for causing a persons death and injuring four others.Ever since he committed this offence, his entire life is full of guilt and he sometimes attempts to commit suicide. He is also a victim of this incident as he needs to undergo extensive counselling, said the defence counsel.He added that Gwenzi displayed Ubuntu when he contributed money towards the now deceaseds funeral and medical expenses for the injured.He showed contrition for committing the offence and assisted the deceaseds family with a sum of US$500, which they accepted.he pledged to buy beasts in the name of sacrificial offering for the lost soul, further submitted the lawyer, before pleading with the magistrate to impose a fine or community service.In the aftermath of the sentencing, social media was inundated with mixed reactions with some frowning upon the lenient sentence while others felt Gwenzi, being a young offender, was supposed to be given a second chance.Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Services (ZPCS) legal counsel Rutendo Mudarikwa said the sentence was in sync with the diversion route the justice system had adopted to keep young first-time offenders out of prison.The courts are wary of passing custodial sentences to young offenders who dont have previous criminal records.In this instance, although negligent driving caused a fatality, the court pursued the diversion route so that young offenders are spared imprisonment. Its a balancing act, said Mudarikwa.A renowned Chinhoyi-based lawyer, who requested anonymity, told NewZimbabwe.com that courts consider various factors when determining sentences, hence the public must be aware of mitigating circumstances that could result in passing of lighter, non-custodial sentences.Generally sentencing is discretionary on the part of the sentencing court and is a result of a consideration of several factors which include (i) the nature and circumstances of the case (ii) the personal circumstances of the accused and (iii) societys interests (retribution), said the lawyer, who preferred anonymity.Now in this case, the offender was youthful, and maybe a first offender, who should be spared the rigours of imprisonment hence he may be turned into a criminal if sent to jail and learn from hardcore criminals.Further, in culpable homicide one is punished for negligence which carries lighter consequences than cases to do with intention. A fine or community service are available for culpable homicide.What accounted in favour of the offender is his youthfulness and being a first offender. The penal justice system seeks to rehabilitate and only punish when rehabilitation has failed, added the top legal practitioner.Another revered lawyer, Mike Mutsvairo of Mushonga-Mutsvairo & Associates, opined that the offender was driving without a valid drivers licence hence this alone aggravated the circumstances.On a charge and conviction of culpable homicide arising out of a driving offence where an accused was driving without a drivers licence, the sentence ranges from imprisonment for life, a shorter prison term, a fine or both.The absence of a drivers licence aggravates the offence so is the running away from the scene. So, the trial court must first make a finding on the degree of negligence before assessing the appropriate sentence S v Chitepo 2017 (1) ZLR 237 H and Manhenga vs S, HH-62-15, said Mutsvairo.The finding must be anchored on a sound factual basis. If this was not done then the sentence imposed would not be in accordance with justice. If it was and going by the summary of facts by the NPA (National Prosecuting Authority), my view is that the accused should have been found guilty of gross negligence or recklessnessRecklessness in traffic cases means no more than gross or aggravated form of negligence or where the driving shows a complete or wilful disregard for the safety as well as rights of other road users.Loss of life due to an accident is an aggravating factor, so are the injuries suffered by the other four (4), which are likely to be serious and permanent.Absence of a drivers licence is a separate offence and adds to the seriousness of the culpable homicide charge.

So, the trial court must first make a finding on the degree of negligence before assessing the appropriate sentence S v Chitepo 2017 (1) ZLR 237 H and Manhenga vs S, HH-62-15, said Mutsvairo.The finding must be anchored on a sound factual basis. If this was not done then the sentence imposed would not be in accordance with justice. If it was and going by the summary of facts by the NPA (National Prosecuting Authority), my view is that the accused should have been found guilty of gross negligence or recklessnessRecklessness in traffic cases means no more than gross or aggravated form of negligence or where the driving shows a complete or wilful disregard for the safety as well as rights of other road users.Loss of life due to an accident is an aggravating factor, so are the injuries suffered by the other four (4), which are likely to be serious and permanent.Absence of a drivers licence is a separate offence and adds to the seriousness of the culpable homicide charge. So is running away from the scene of the accident. This would point to imprisonment being the appropriate punishment, said the top lawyer.Any other sentence would only come into play if there are special circumstances that made the accused drive the vehicle, for example driving under duress or having a medical emergency e.g. transporting someone with a life-threatening medical condition to hospital.If there were no special circumstances, the sentence imposed fails to recognise the seriousness of the crime and society loses its confidence in the criminal justice system, especially in a society where fatal road accidents have become prevalent and endemic.The facts as narrated by the NPA shows that a deterrent sentence was necessary. The accused can consider himself extremely fortunate that he was treated with such excessive leniency.The sentence is disturbingly inappropriate and not in accordance with the requirements of the law. It is not in accordance with real and substantial justice and the NPA ought to file an appeal against the sentence imposed unless if there are facts warranting the sentence imposed that were not made public, said the senior counsel.The Passengers Association of Zimbabwe (PAZ) described the ruling as woefully inadequate and deeply unjust.We are appalled by a justice system that seems to prioritise the perpetrator over the victims, effectively rendering the latter invisible and voiceless.This ruling perpetuates the notion that the lives of ordinary citizens, particularly the vulnerable, are of little value, said PAZ national coordinator Tafadzwa Golaiti.PAZ is lobbying for an appeal of the ruling, as well as a broader review of how road traffic fatalities are prosecuted.We demand a more just and equitable outcome that acknowledges the gravity of this tragic incident and holds the perpetrator accountable, said Goliati.The Ministry of Justice as well as Parliament were urged to address what PAZ terms systemic failures in the legal handling of road traffic crimes.\n\nHe lost his mother when he was still a teenager and he was taken care of by his maternal grandmother whom with age, might not have taken a firm grip in nurturing him into a responsible adult person.\n\nCourt also heard that Gwenzi was full of guilt for causing a persons death and injuring four others.Ever since he committed this offence, his entire life is full of guilt and he sometimes attempts to commit suicide.

So, the trial court must first make a finding on the degree of negligence before assessing the appropriate sentence S v Chitepo 2017 (1) ZLR 237 H and Manhenga vs S, HH-62-15, said Mutsvairo.\n\nThe finding must be anchored on a sound factual basis. If this was not done then the sentence imposed would not be in accordance with justice. If it was and going by the summary of facts by the NPA (National Prosecuting Authority), my view is that the accused should have been found guilty of gross negligence or recklessness\n\nRecklessness in traffic cases means no more than gross or aggravated form of negligence or where the driving shows a complete or wilful disregard for the safety as well as rights of other road users.\n\nLoss of life due to an accident is an aggravating factor, so are the injuries suffered by the other four (4), which are likely to be serious and permanent.\n\nAbsence of a drivers licence is a separate offence and adds to the seriousness of the culpable homicide charge. So is running away from the scene of the accident. This would point to imprisonment being the appropriate punishment, said the top lawyer.\n\nAny other sentence would only come into play if there are special circumstances that made the accused drive the vehicle, for example driving under duress or having a medical emergency e.g. transporting someone with a life-threatening medical condition to hospital.\n\nIf there were no special circumstances, the sentence imposed fails to recognise the seriousness of the crime and society loses its confidence in the criminal justice system, especially in a society where fatal road accidents have become prevalent and endemic.\n\nThe facts as narrated by the NPA shows that a deterrent sentence was necessary. The accused can consider himself extremely fortunate that he was treated with such excessive leniency.\n\nThe sentence is disturbingly inappropriate and not in accordance with the requirements of the law. It is not in accordance with real and substantial justice and the NPA ought to file an appeal against the sentence imposed unless if there are facts warranting the sentence imposed that were not made public, said the senior counsel.\n\nThe Passengers Association of Zimbabwe (PAZ) described the ruling as woefully inadequate and deeply unjust.We are appalled by a justice system that seems to prioritise the perpetrator over the victims, effectively rendering the latter invisible and voiceless.This ruling perpetuates the notion that the lives of ordinary citizens, particularly the vulnerable, are of little value, said PAZ national coordinator Tafadzwa Golaiti.PAZ is lobbying for an appeal of the ruling, as well as a broader review of how road traffic fatalities are prosecuted.We demand a more just and equitable outcome that acknowledges the gravity of this tragic incident and holds the perpetrator accountable, said Goliati.The Ministry of Justice as well as Parliament were urged to address what PAZ terms systemic failures in the legal handling of road traffic crimes.\n\nThe Passengers Association of Zimbabwe (PAZ) described the ruling as woefully inadequate and deeply unjust.\n\nWe are appalled by a justice system that seems to prioritise the perpetrator over the victims, effectively rendering the latter invisible and voiceless.This ruling perpetuates the notion that the lives of ordinary citizens, particularly the vulnerable, are of little value, said PAZ national coordinator Tafadzwa Golaiti.PAZ is lobbying for an appeal of the ruling, as well as a broader review of how road traffic fatalities are prosecuted.We demand a more just and equitable outcome that acknowledges the gravity of this tragic incident and holds the perpetrator accountable, said Goliati.The Ministry of Justice as well as Parliament were urged to address what PAZ terms systemic failures in the legal handling of road traffic crimes.\n\nWe are appalled by a justice system that seems to prioritise the perpetrator over the victims, effectively rendering the latter invisible and voiceless.\n\nThis ruling perpetuates the notion that the lives of ordinary citizens, particularly the vulnerable, are of little value, said PAZ national coordinator Tafadzwa Golaiti.PAZ is lobbying for an appeal of the ruling, as well as a broader review of how road traffic fatalities are prosecuted.We demand a more just and equitable outcome that acknowledges the gravity of this tragic incident and holds the perpetrator accountable, said Goliati.The Ministry of Justice as well as Parliament were urged to address what PAZ terms systemic failures in the legal handling of road traffic crimes.\n\nThis ruling perpetuates the notion that the lives of ordinary citizens, particularly the vulnerable, are of little value, said PAZ national coordinator Tafadzwa Golaiti.\n\nPAZ is lobbying for an appeal of the ruling, as well as a broader review of how road traffic fatalities are prosecuted.We demand a more just and equitable outcome that acknowledges the gravity of this tragic incident and holds the perpetrator accountable, said Goliati.The Ministry of Justice as well as Parliament were urged to address what PAZ terms systemic failures in the legal handling of road traffic crimes.\n\nPAZ is lobbying for an appeal of the ruling, as well as a broader review of how road traffic fatalities are prosecuted.\n\nWe demand a more just and equitable outcome that acknowledges the gravity of this tragic incident and holds the perpetrator accountable, said Goliati.The Ministry of Justice as well as Parliament were urged to address what PAZ terms systemic failures in the legal handling of road traffic crimes.\n\nWe demand a more just and equitable outcome that acknowledges the gravity of this tragic incident and holds the perpetrator accountable, said Goliati.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice as well as Parliament were urged to address what PAZ terms systemic failures in the legal handling of road traffic crimes.\n\nThe Ministry of Justice as well as Parliament were urged to address what PAZ terms systemic failures in the legal handling of road traffic crimes.\n\n",

Inmates survive on a single meal daily.\n\nDuring a Question-and-Answer session, Zemura queried government policy on the issue.\n\nIs it government policy for people who are in jails to sleep without warm clothes and blankets, without eating, especially during this winter period?\n\nI am asking because it seems as if it is now a pattern (norm) people do not have jerseys, blankets and others\n\nZemura was interrupted by the Speaker for using an unacceptable language or word (slang)- pattern.\n\nI meant to say, has it become a norm now in Zimbabwe that those who are in jails, whether sentenced or not, suffer from pneumonia as a result of catching a cold? They sleep on dry, cold floors without blankets and mattresses, said Zemura without naming the jail (s).\n\nActing Leader of Government Business in Parliament Anxious Masuka responded that government provided those in prisons with basics but due to the economic challenges, the MP should be specific so that the government can deal with the issues she raised.\n\nGovernment, in its plans, takes those who have been incarcerated for rehabilitation so that they can be reintegrated into society. During the process, the government provides for the basics like food, shelter and clothing.\n\nHowever, when there are challenges, I request that if there is a specific jail, then that communication should be brought forward so that we will be able to address it properly, Masuka said.\n\nThe Speaker urged the MP to name those prisons without blankets and food.\n\nThe question should address the jails that do not have blankets, Mudenda said.\n\nBefore he could finish his statement, Zemura shouted all jails.\n\nMudenda posed a question to the MP before advising her to put her question in writing and to be specific.\n\nDid you go to all the jails, Hon. Member? Please put it in writing and be specific as to which jails where there are no blankets, said Mudenda.\n\nMost prisons that were visited by a Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs had no blankets and food for inmates.\n\nPrisoners complained over a poor diet, surviving on boiled cabbage and sadza once or twice a day.\n\nAt Chikurubi Maximum Prison, besides being overpopulated, inmates revealed that they had no blankets and most were using blankets supplied by their families or the churches and well-wishers. The majority of prisoners was wearing tattered prison garb.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nLEGISLATORS must ensure that public resources are equitably channelled towards programmes designed to improve the livelihoods of the citizenry, Speaker of Parliament, Jacob Mudenda, has said.\n\nOfficially opening a capacity building workshop for Members of Parliament on Budget Analysis for the Public Accounts and Budget and Finance committees respectively in Bulawayo this weekend, Mudenda said the two committees,charged with the sacred responsibility of demanding unwavering standards on the value-for-money across every tier of government expenditure must be actively involved in every step of the budgetary processes, moving beyond perfunctory examination to critical analysis of the national budget.In the past, analysis of the National Budget has been done by others, leaving you as mere spectators in decisions that directly affect the welfare of the people you are sworn to serve.Today, you begin the process of becoming the lion that writes its own story through the mastery of rigorous budget analysis. As the saying goes: Until the lion learns to write, every story will glorify the hunter, Mudenda said.According to the Speaker, pro-poor budgeting, which revolves around a fundamental question regarding every budget allocation: Will this directly improve the life of the poorest family in your constituency?Mudenda highlighted that there was need by members to employ Artificial Intelligence (Al) through database analytics in order to unravel the political economy undergirding the daily lives of the people.He told them that the approach was in consonant with Nelson Mandelas affirmation that: Overcoming poverty is not a task of charity, it is an act of justice. It is the protection of a fundamental human right, the right to dignity and a decent life.This pro-poor approach should align the budget to the Sustainable Development Goals and Agenda 2063, particularly the forte of the elimination of poverty, achieving zero hunger and ensuring sound health and well-being for all.Also, of importance, proficiency in budget analysis demanded a comprehensive understanding of the Public Finance Management (PFM) framework.The PFM system is built on strong legal and institutional foundations which delineate every stage of the budget process namely, from the initial planning and preparation, approval, implementation and expenditure, to the final monitoring and evaluation level of due analysis.Centrally, the framework places fiscal oversight on the committees responsibility to exercise with probity the budgetary processes. This is where you, as Parliamentarians, must step forward to fulfil your hallowed responsibility.The role of Parliament in budget oversight is not a matter of political convenience, executive benevolence or sheer happenstance. It is a constitutional mandate that forms the very juridical foundation of the budgetary processes, stated Mudenda.He reminded members that the Constitution did not just permit them to scrutinise public expenditure but, also commanded them to do so because they must ensure that public resources were expended on programmes designed to improve the livelihoods of the citizenry with greatest equity.The Constitution speaks with crystalline clarity. Section 119(3) states that: all institutions and agencies of the State and government at every level are accountable to Parliament, said the Speaker.Beyond the legal framework which anchors the Select Committees financial oversight, Mudenda said committees must have an appreciation of the national budget matrix.Section 298 provides for principles of public financial management which should act as the beacon for Parliamentary oversight on how public funds ought to be expended prudentially for the sake of democratic accountability.Equally, Section 299 complements Section 298 by specifically obligating Parliament to monitor and oversee expenditure by all State institutions.The primary objective of budget analysis was to identify opportunities for improving the quality and quantity of public spending in counterbalance to the available revenues.Furthermore, international protocols have established standards that can assist in measuring whether Budget allocations truly prioritise the needs of the vulnerable people.The Abuja Declaration calls for 15% of the National Budget to be allocated to health, while the Dakar Declaration of 2000 and the Incheon Declaration require 20% of government expenses to be allocated to education. In the same vein, the Maputo Declaration sets a target of 10% for the agriculture sector, the Speaker explained.However, sometimes these international standards were not met because of negative economic imperatives that may be obtaining in those countries.Mudenda told members that the budget analysis must be guided by the Bill of Rights as provided for in Chapter 4 of the national Constitution.The need to take cognisance of the climate change impact phenomenon, as more resilient, climate-proof infrastructure development demands robust budgetary allocations was of profound importance.\n\nOfficially opening a capacity building workshop for Members of Parliament on Budget Analysis for the Public Accounts and Budget and Finance committees respectively in Bulawayo this weekend, Mudenda said the two committees,\n\ncharged with the sacred responsibility of demanding unwavering standards on the value-for-money across every tier of government expenditure must be actively involved in every step of the budgetary processes, moving beyond perfunctory examination to critical analysis of the national budget.\n\nIn the past, analysis of the National Budget has been done by others, leaving you as mere spectators in decisions that directly affect the welfare of the people you are sworn to serve.Today, you begin the process of becoming the lion that writes its own story through the mastery of rigorous budget analysis.

It is the protection of a fundamental human right, the right to dignity and a decent life.\n\nThis pro-poor approach should align the budget to the Sustainable Development Goals and Agenda 2063, particularly the forte of the elimination of poverty, achieving zero hunger and ensuring sound health and well-being for all.Also, of importance, proficiency in budget analysis demanded a comprehensive understanding of the Public Finance Management (PFM) framework.The PFM system is built on strong legal and institutional foundations which delineate every stage of the budget process namely, from the initial planning and preparation, approval, implementation and expenditure, to the final monitoring and evaluation level of due analysis.Centrally, the framework places fiscal oversight on the committees responsibility to exercise with probity the budgetary processes. This is where you, as Parliamentarians, must step forward to fulfil your hallowed responsibility.The role of Parliament in budget oversight is not a matter of political convenience, executive benevolence or sheer happenstance. It is a constitutional mandate that forms the very juridical foundation of the budgetary processes, stated Mudenda.He reminded members that the Constitution did not just permit them to scrutinise public expenditure but, also commanded them to do so because they must ensure that public resources were expended on programmes designed to improve the livelihoods of the citizenry with greatest equity.The Constitution speaks with crystalline clarity.

May Allah accept him in Aljannatul Firdaus, Amin, he said on X.\n\nThe former Nigerian president had been in the United Kingdom since April 2025 for what was initially described as a routine medical check-up. However, he reportedly fell ill shortly after his arrival and remained hospitalized until his death.\n\nA former military ruler from 1983 to 1985 and Nigerias elected president from 2015 to 2023, Buhari was a key figure in Africas political landscape.\n\nHis presidency was marked by a strong anti-corruption campaign, efforts to combat insurgency, and major infrastructure investments, though also criticised for economic hardship, human rights concerns, and repeated medical absences abroad.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE streets of Leeds in the United Kingdom (UK) roared with the sound of resistance this Saturday as Zimbabwean nationals and solidarity groups marched 15 kilometres through the city in a protest against tyranny by President Emmerson Mnangagwa back home.\n\nOrganised by the Zimbabwe Human Rights Organisation (ZHRO), the demonstrations went ahead undeterred by recent threats from Mnangagwas government, with participants singing revolutionary songs and chanting calls for democratic change, standing defiant in the face of intimidation.\n\nThe walk came in the wake of chilling warnings from Zimbabwean authorities, who have vowed to apply the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Amendment Act (2023) against anyoneinside or outside Zimbabwewho tarnishes the image of the so-called Second Republic. Despite this, participants in Leeds said they would not be silenced.\n\nWe are not afraid, said one marcher.\n\nWe will continue to speak out against corruption, nepotism, and oppression.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) recently confirmed that Blessed Runesu Bombshell Geza, a leading figure in Zimbabwean demonstrations and stay-aways, is now on Interpols watchlist. But rather than deterring action, his listing appears to have further galvanised exiled Zimbabweans and international supporters.\n\nThe march saw enthusiastic participation from a broad coalition of groups, including members of Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), ZAPU, Mthwakazi Republic Party, and others who joined ZHRO in calling for regime change. Under the blazing summer heat, the spirited crowd kept its energy high, drumming and singing all the way.\n\nThere was a roar and thunder in Leeds when drums were beaten by Ettar Mhlanga and Patson Muzuwa, who electrified the atmosphere with energetic drum beating thereby spurring the crowd in a determined move showing that the diaspora community is no longer willing to remain silent.\n\nAmong the organisers of the walk were, Pamela Magwizi, Mgcini Victor Hlophe, Regina Mahowo, Happiness Ncube, Phylis Melody Magejo, Josephine Jenje-Mudimbu and John Burke.\n\nZHRO members in attendance included, Samuel Jambaya, Moses Mbano, Alwyn Mbano, Shepherd Yuda, Shepherd Mungu, Salius Sibanda, Dickson Chikwizo, Henry Makambe, Pretty Ncube, Dadirayi Mukwedeya, Genius Mamwadu, Victor Simon, Denis Gwasira, Philile Dube, Fransisca Chiduku, Ettar Patience Mhlanga, Evy Kangandi, Charles Kanyimo, Tarisai Mapondera, Sandra Chidemo, Jamie Hunter, Milton Bingwa, Dumisani Nyathi, Nobukhosi Dube, and Eness Mapungwana.\n\nCoordinators Petty Ziramba, Patson Muzuwa, Mavis Mutsvangwa and Shepherd Yuda said the Leeds demonstration was part of a global wave of resistance.\n\nIn Canada, solidarity protests were led by activist Mellisa Tonderai Tagarira, while in the United States, 19-year-old Bethel Princess Chiyangwa led a demonstration alongside Panashe Vongai Trish Sivindani. In South Africa Jabulani Ndlovu lead a team of 40 people in their quest to be heard.\n\nThe protestors vowed to continue their campaign until real democratic reform is achieved in Zimbabwe.\n\nFear is no longer an option. We will not stop until our country is free, said one participant.\n\n",
