            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nIN a grotesque tribute yesterday, President Emmerson Mnangagwa paid a solemn tribute to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the passing of former president Robert Mugabe, whom he ousted through a military-assisted operation in 2017.\n\nMugabe, Zimbabwes founding post-independence leader, died in Singapore on September 6, 2019, two years following his removal from office by Mnangagwa and his Lacoste faction, which fought a bitter succession battle against the Generation 40 faction fronted by wife Grace Mugabe, Saviour Kasukuwere, Walter Mzembi, Jonathan Moyo and Patrick Zhuwawo.In his commemorative message, Mnangagwa praised Mugabe as a freedom fighter par excellence, a veteran nationalist, and revered frontline Statesman.Today, the 6th September, 2025, His Excellency the President E.D. Mnangagwa, the Party and Government join the former First Family and the entire nation in commemorating the passing on of the late First Executive President of Zimbabwe, Cde Robert Gabriel Mugabe, said Mnangagwa.A freedom fighter par excellence, and veteran nationalist, the late Cde R.G. Mugabe, was a revered Frontline Statesman who fearlessly championed the political and economic emancipation of Southern Africa and continent of Africa.Born on February 21, 1924, Mugabe endured 11 years imprisonment at the hands of the settler colonial regime before emerging in 1975 to lead Zanu in a protracted war of independence from bases in Mozambique.Mugabe prosecuted the armed struggle, known as the Second Chimurenga/Umvukela, culminated in Zimbabwes independence in 1980.Mnangagwa described Mugabe as a true son of the soil and iconic liberation fighter, whose political astuteness shaped the First Republic.Among his landmark legacies, the Land Reform Programme redefined land ownership patterns, addressing historic injustices of colonial dispossession.His indigenisation and economic empowerment policies sought to restore dignity, self-belief, and resilience to Zimbabweans, even in the face of illegal sanctions, the 82-year-old Zanu PF leader said.Himself a beneficiary of Mugabes benevolence, Mnangagwa added that in the social sphere, Mugabe broadened access to education and healthcare for the once marginalised majority blacks.In recognition of this, Mnangagwa said, the Second Republic established a National Honours and Awards category in his name, dedicated to human capital development.Mnangagwa equated Mugabe to fallen continental giants such as Julius Nyerere, Jomo Kenyatta, Kenneth Kaunda, Samora Machel, Agostino Neto, Sam Nujoma, Joshua Nkomo, and Nelson Mandela.He was a fervent Pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to fighting apartheid, promoting African renaissance, and advancing the cause of the downtrodden across the world, Mnangagwa said.As we remember our late President, the Second Republic once again re-dedicates itself to preserving the legacy of Cde R.G. Mugabe by winding up the successful National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) and preparing NDS2 guided by the goal to have a society that is free, democratic and prosperous, which leaves no-one and no place behind through inclusive development, he added.Mnangagwa noted that his Zanu PF party and government commit to iconic Mugabes enduring mantra that Zimbabwe will never be a colony again.\n\nMugabe, Zimbabwes founding post-independence leader, died in Singapore on September 6, 2019, two years following his removal from office by Mnangagwa and his Lacoste faction, which fought a bitter succession battle against the Generation 40 faction fronted by wife Grace Mugabe, Saviour Kasukuwere, Walter Mzembi, Jonathan Moyo and Patrick Zhuwawo.\n\nIn his commemorative message, Mnangagwa praised Mugabe as a freedom fighter par excellence, a veteran nationalist, and revered frontline Statesman.Today, the 6th September, 2025, His Excellency the President E.D.

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nDESPITE efforts being made by the Zimbabwean authorities to revamp the countrys health situation, an opposition member of the National Assembly Ransome Makamure has urged the government to declare the public health a state of emergency.\n\nMoving a motion in Parliament this Thursday, Makamure told the acting Speaker that despite the Constitution of Zimbabwes provision of right to health care for all citizens, the majority were finding it difficult to access basic health care services.\n\nMakamure stated that section 76(4) of Zimbabwes Constitution obliges the State to take reasonable measures, within the limits of available resources to achieve the progressive realisation of the right to health care, but this was not the case on the ground.\n\nI urge the government to declare public health a state of emergency with a focus on maternal care and chronic diseases and to mobilise both domestic and international support as a matter of urgency.\n\nThis House beseeches the government to declare the current public health situation a state of emergency so that the requisite resources can be mobilised to mitigate the challenges faced whilst the government ensures that the Finance ministry disburses all outstanding budgetary allocations due to the Health and Child Care ministry, Makamure said.\n\nThe MP highlighted that the countrys health system had collapsed whilst the constitutional right to health care was now a privilege, only being accessed by a few.\n\nThe health crisis, according to Makamure, reflected structural under-funding where Zimbabwe currently spends less than 40 dollars per patient annually, far below the Abuja Declaration target of 86 dollars per patient.\n\nThe public healthcare system is in critical decline with over 250 preventable deaths recorded at major referral hospitals in 2024 alone, largely due to persistent shortage of essential medicines and basic equipment including oxygen, painkillers, antibiotics, gloves, surgical supplies and even clean water, said Makamure.\n\nThe acting Speaker cautioned the MP saying, as much as we want to do our debates in a free and open space, it is important to do that with some level of decorum that will not necessarily tarnish this House or cast aspersions that are unnecessary for our country.\n\nI am not talking about things that I read, I am talking about things that our people are experiencing out there, Makamure responded.\n\nThe acting Speaker did not agree, saying Our hospitals have not collapsed, people are still being cured. Yes, we might have problems but let us put it in that perspective.\n\nThe MP further alleged that at most public referral centres, patients were routinely asked to bring their own painkillers, cotton wool and surgical gloves, highlighting the depth of under-funding and resource scarcity.\n\nAt Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo, repeated breakdowns of major equipment have left patients, particularly cancer patients, without treatment for extended periods, effectively turning a diagnosis into a death sentence for many.\n\nAcross central, provincial and district hospitals, patients often sleep on the floor due to a lack of beds and hospital kitchens frequently run out of food, forcing some patients to go hungry while recovering from illness or surgery.\n\nMany hospital buildings and infrastructure have deteriorated significantly. Peeling paint, leaking roofs, broken windows, blocked plumbing and outdated equipment dominate once functional health institutions Makamure added.\n\nThe legislator told the acting speaker that the current physical decay did not inspire hope in patients, but deepened despair, reinforcing the perception that the lives do not matter to those in power and Parliament included.\n\nThis dire situation reflects systematic or systemic neglect where under-investment, poor planning and misplaced priorities have reduced public health facilities to places of suffering.\n\nThe MP stated that the erosion of basic standards in patient care was not only a humanitarian crisis but a direct violation of Zimbabwes right to health and dignity.\n\nThe late Alex Magaisa (may his soul rest in peace) said: a State that cannot provide basic healthcare to its people cannot call itself sovereign, the MP told the house.\n\nHe said the government was failing to guarantee the most basic condition of life, which is health.\n\nFigures speak for themselves, said Makamure before Zanu PF Chief Whip Pupurai Togarepi chipped in; We cannot allow the gentleman, whoever he is, to continue lying. Here at this Parliament, if he wants to go to the clinic here, he is going to be treated.\n\nSo, for him now to start attacking the State to the point of saying we cannot call ourselves sovereign, is he supposed to be a Zimbabwean or we are dealing with some foreigner? Togarepi fumed.\n\nWe are not taking what he is saying lightly. We do not want you to come here and parade your hatred of our institutions.\n\nWe need people who are honest when they debate. We have challenges, nobody can run away from that. We are a developing country after all. We do not want somebody to come here and dramatise things that are not there.\n\nOpposition MP Shakespear Hamauswa intervened on a point of order.\n\nWe saw on social media a publication by Hon. Minister Machakaire, when he visited Parirenyatwa Hospital lamenting the situation at our hospitals, that was then followed by the visit of His Excellency, President E. D. Mnangagwa.\n\nIf you have a situation in a country which requires the visitation of number one of that country, then it means that situation is in a state of emergency, MP Hamauswa told the acting speaker.\n\nThe acting speaker however, reminded Hamauswa that Zimbabwes public health situation was functional with efforts being done to correct the healthcare system.\n\nMakamure went further giving examples of institutions experiencing challenges.\n\nAs of March 2025, Zimbabwes rural health system remains in a dire state, exposing deep structural and policy failures. According to the Zimbabwe Association of Doctors for Human Rights (ZADHR), over 75% of rural clinics lack electricity.\n\nThe doctor-to-patient ratio stands approximately at one doctor saving 4,300 people nationally.\n\nThe government has failed to implement meaningful reforms, perpetuating inequality and avoidable loss of life in under-served regions, he said.\n\nHe even went further to expose the poor remuneration of health workers.\n\nSalaries for public health workers remain dismally low, ranging between USD250 and USD284 a month, barely enough to survive, comparing that to USD540 which was being earned during the Inclusive Government.\n\nHe said the poor remuneration and lack of career growth, training or incentives for healthcare workers had driven more than 4,000 health professionals, including 2, 600 nurses, to leave the country in search of greener pastures.\n\nIf you look at non-communicable diseases, public hospitals lack diagnostic equipment, cancer screening services and those who are diagnosed with the disease spend years on the waiting list.\n\nMakamure alleged there was no clear public record of how much was spent on procuring cancer machines or whether those machines are fully functional.\n\n",
