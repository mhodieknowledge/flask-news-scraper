            "content": "BBC\n\nMusician Chris Brown says hes suing a film studio over a documentary released last year which included accusations of sexual assault.\n\nChris Brown: A History of Violence was released by Warner Bros in October and featured testimony from an anonymous dancer who claimed he raped her on a yacht in 2020.\n\nIn a statement, the Forever singers lawyers say the film is defamatory, and her claims were baseless and sensationalised, accusing Warner Bros of recklessly damaging his reputation.\n\nAs well as Warner Bros, the lawsuit also names production company Ample. Neither firm responded when contacted for comment by BBC Newsbeat.\n\nChris Browns lawyers say he is seeking $500m (405m), after filing the complaint at a court in Los Angeles on Tuesday.\n\nThe statement goes on to say that his lawyers had told producers the allegations  which also included evidence tampering  were misleading and discredited but that Warner Bros proceeded to release the documentary without regard for Mr Brown, prioritising profits over journalistic integrity.\n\nIn a copy of the complaint, seen by BBC Newsbeat, Chris Browns lawyers cast doubt on the dancers reliability as a witness and highlight three claims in the documentary which they say are false.\n\nThese include a comment that he has a predisposition for punching women in the face, the dancers allegation he raped her and a claim he manipulated or deleted texts between them before sharing them with police.\n\nLawyers say the documentary states in every available fashion that he is a serial rapist and sexual abuser.\n\nThe allegations are said to have caused him emotional distress as well as significant harm to [his] reputation, career and business opportunities.\n\nThe documentary has, they say, irreparably tarnished [his] career and standing in the public eye.\n\nChris Brown first faced allegations from the dancer, known in court and in the documentary as Jane Doe, in 2022 when she sued him for $20m (14.9m).\n\nHer lawsuit claimed he drugged and raped her during a party on a yacht at a property owned by Sean Diddy Combs in Miami, Florida.\n\nBut the case was reportedly dismissed by a judge.\n\nThe 35-year-old has had a history of well-documented legal troubles.\n\nIn 2014, hepleaded guilty to punching a man outside a hotelin Washington DC while he was taking a photo with two women.\n\nTwo years later,a model claimed he assaulted her at a Las Vegas casino, however police said there was not enough evidence to bring charges.\n\nA court also ordered him tostay away from ex-girlfriend Karrueche Tranin 2017 after she claimed he threatened to kill her.\n\nLast years documentary also examined other allegations against Chris Brown including a rape inquiry in Paris  in which he was released without charge  and assaulting then-girlfriend Rihanna in 2009, which he pleaded guilty to.\n\nHis lawyers say hes never been found at fault for any type of sexual crime.\n\nTheir [Warner Bros and Amples] actions undermine not only Mr Browns decade-long efforts to rebuild his life but also the credibility of true survivors of violence, his lawyer Levi McCathern says.\n\nChris Brown says a portion of any damages would be donated to survivors of sexual violence.\n\n",

Hes got a chance to invite me to the table of dialogue.\n\nEPA Daniel Chapo has promised to heal divisions created by the election\n\nIn his interview with the BBC, Chapo said he wanted to govern in an inclusive way, and to introduce reforms to address concerns about the electoral law, human rights and freedom of expression.\n\nHe said talks were currently taking place with opposition parties represented in the new parliament, and they would later be widened to include all segments of society.\n\nChapo added that he wanted to form a government that was open to all Mozambicans, but he wanted to stress that the profile of the people is very important.\n\nAsked whether he believed Mondlane qualified to serve in government, Chapo replied: It will depend because there is a team that is right now considering that, on the profile of the people, their competencies, their meritocracy, the patriotism  all these pre-requisites that Im alluding to.\n\nIf the team reaches the conclusion that these people have the right profile, they will be part of the government. Those who do not have that profile will not take part.\n\nAged 47, Chapo was chosen by Frelimo, which has been in power since independence 49 years ago, as its candidate to rally young voters affected by high unemployment, and fed up with the partys decades-long rule.\n\nHe told the BBC that he wanted both local and foreign investment to increase in Mozambique in order to make the economy more dynamic.\n\nThis would help create jobs for young people so that they could build their homes, establish their families and stabilize their lives.\n\nMondlane, 50, was seen to have considerable support among young people after he rallied them during the election campaign with the slogan Save Mozambique  this country is ours.\n\nHe contested the poll as an independent after breaking away from the main opposition Renamo party.\n\nA small party that backed his candidacy won a few parliamentary seats in the election.\n\n",

Yesterday after inauguration, Donald Trump made nearly 100 such decisions for the American people that resonated with many on the globe while offending some but putting America first, far-reaching decisions on gender ( recognizing male and female only; A complete Reset to Genesis), exiting Paris Climate Agreement ( a wasteful annual travel expedition for most governments with huge delegates appetite), exiting WHO ( whose disastrous COVID lock downs created more tender barons and impoverished billions) etc.\n\nI am still consumed with analysing the rest of the decisions but they are all cutting wasteful and unnecessary expenditures for the American public while bringing the factories and jobs home!\n\nZanu PF is pushing for the extension of Mnangagwas term in office and to delay the 2028 elections by two years, a move which Mzembi described as completely unproductive.\n\nIn Zimbabwe regrettably we are consumed with one decision called 2030, a completely unproductive, divisive and selfish decision on self-perpetuity and entitlement, and it shall be so for the next two years waking up to this energy-sapping medieval decision that will put us into an election mode hardly two years after emerging from one and three years to the next.\n\nWhen are we going to be making historical decisions like being the first country to mount our flag on Mars? What a mess ! Mzembi wrote on his X account.\n\nZimbabwe has been grappling with high inflation, unemployment, and persistent power shortages and critics have been saying that the government mostly focuses on perpetual electioneering at the expense of governance and development.\n\n",

ZNCC said It seemed that inflationary pressures had been contained as reflected in the month-on-month ZWG and US$ inflation rates.\n\nWhilst inflation statistics from ZimStat show that the US$ inflation rate for October 2024 was 0,7%, the ZiG inflation rate significantly increased. The ZWG month-on-month inflation rate was 37,2% in October 20124, gaining 31.4 points on the September 2024 rate of 5,8%.\n\nThis means that prices as measured by the all items ZWG CPI, increased by an average of 37,2% between September and October 2024, ZNCC added.\n\n",

They must never be insulted by the presiding persons, said Malaba.\n\nAccording to the State-run daily, The Herald, National Council of Chiefs president Mtshane Khumalo blamed the failure to have these training sessions as the reason behind some chiefs behaviour.\n\nNumerous other traditional leaders have been caught offside.\n\nAdded the ZLHR after the release of the video last year: Chief Nyamaropas conduct betrays a contemptuous and demeaning attitude towards women and purveys and perpetuates such attitude considering his position of influence and the fact that the incident is on tape and has been widely disseminated across various social media platforms.\n\n",

Pursuant to the above, the Company has placed the Monomotapa Hotel on the market for sale, said the statement.\n\nThe impending negotiations, if successful, will constitute a transaction, accordingly, the company would be seeking the approval of its shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meeting to be convened at the appropriate time.\n\nShareholders and the investing public are therefore advised to exercise caution when dealing with the Companys securities until advised of the conclusion of the said ongoing processes, said African Sun.\n\nLast year, African Sun Limited, a hospitality group, called off the highly publicised sale of its two properties, the Beitbridge Express Hotel and Great Zimbabwe Hotel in Masvingo, which were to be sold for a combined US$6.9 million to TD Hotels and Leisure (Private) Limited, a rising local hospitality company.\n\nInitially, African Sun had stated that the sale was intended to generate capital by offloading assets deemed non-essential to the groups future.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nAT LEAST ten Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) officers and Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) operatives based in Gokwe are under investigation after going on an extortion spree in which they netted US$2,030 from small businesses.\n\nThe case, filed with ZRP Gokwe last week, is being investigated under RRB numbers 6248660-63. No arrests have been made yet.\n\nAccording to a police memo sent to the Officer Commanding Gokwe District by the Officer in Charge Gokwe and gleaned by NewZimbabwe.com, the ten are being charged with Criminal Abuse of Duty as Public Officials as defined in Section 174 of the Criminal law [Codification and Reform] Act.\n\nAccording to the memo detective constables Tafadzwa Siwela, Daniel Chishapira and Batsirayi Madhongo, detective sergeant Takunda Vhezha, assistant inspector Chinyani John, police intelligence officer Edias Mugabe, CIO operatives Hungwe and Chatikobo, and two others are being investigated.\n\nThe crew was made up of security details who claimed to their victims that they were part of the CIOs crack Ferret Force sent to rural Gokwe to investigate abuses of the Exchange Rate Act and the smuggling of goods.\n\nHungwe and Chatikobo stand accused of collecting US$760 between October last year and January 4, 2025, from Wonderson Tamande whom they accused of not having enough papers to stay in Zimbabwe. Tamande is an Ethiopian national.\n\nThey also accused him of having smuggled goods in his possession.\n\nChatikobo was to follow this up with another US$200 in connivance with Chishapira and Madhongo after staging the arrest of Tamandes shopkeeper. According to the memo, the shopkeeper had used an illegal exchange rate in selling bread to them.\n\nThey demanded a US$1,000 bribe before eventually settling for US$200.\n\nThe three were to demand a US$80 protection fee from Fantasy Zambuko who owns Fantasy General Dealer on January 2, 2025, after notifying him of an anti-smuggling operation they were supposed to initiate in the area.\n\nThe continued spree saw Chatikobo going on to collect US$300 from Tamande after demanding US$3,000 before he roped in Chinyani to take another US$140.\n\nOn another occasion, a team of four males and a female-identifying themselves as part of the Ferret Team approached another Gokwe businessman Tafadzwa Nyakudzambara and extorted US$300.\n\nOn January 8, 2025 Chatikobo, Chishapira, Mugabe, alongside two others identified as Mukamuri and Mushonga approached Simbarashe Ziwaya and extorted US$250.\n\nAll four victims filed complaints with the police on January 14 this year.\n\n",
