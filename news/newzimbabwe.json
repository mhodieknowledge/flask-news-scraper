            "content": "BBC\n\nRapper A$AP Rocky has been found not guilty of firing a gun at a former friend.\n\nA jury in Los Angeles acquitted the musician, whose legal name is Rakim Mayers, on two felony assault charges that carried up to 24 years in prison.\n\nTerell Ephron claimed the Grammy-nominated hip-hop star opened fire at him during an argument on a Hollywood street on 6 November 2021, grazing his knuckles with one of the shots.\n\nMr Mayers, who is also a fashion mogul and the longtime partner of pop star Rihanna, denied the charges, arguing that the weapon was a prop gun and that his former friend, who calls himself A$AP Relli, was only after money.\n\nAs the first not-guilty verdict was read on Tuesday, the court rang with screams and clapping. Mr Mayers rushed towards his family and Rihanna, who were seated behind him. He dived over a wooden barrier to embrace them.\n\nRihanna had been a repeated presence in court during the trial, and for Tuesdays verdict, brought along their two sons, two-year-old RZA and one-year-old Riot.\n\nMr Mayers also hugged his lawyers and appeared to have tears in his eyes as the second not-guilty verdict was read.\n\nThank God for saving my life, Mr Mayers said aloud. He thanked members of the 12-person jury.\n\nThe rapper was arrested on the two felony assault charges after a heated argument with his former friend in the heart of Hollywood.\n\nMr Mayers and Mr Ephron have known each other since high school in New York and were part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective.\n\nTheir friendship cooled as A$AP Rockys career took off.\n\nAuthorities said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November 2021, a day after the pair had a disagreement, outside a hotel about a block from the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nAn altercation ensued.\n\nMr Mayers was alleged to have pulled out a gun from his waistband and pointed it at Mr Ephron, telling him: Ill kill you right now.\n\nHe looked me in my eyes and pointed the gun at me, Mr Ephron testified.\n\nMr Ephron said he told the rapper to fire the weapon, but Mr Mayers started walking away. As he left, Mr Ephron followed, shouting at him.\n\nProsecutors alleged that at this point, Mr Mayers once again pulled out the gun and fired multiple shots, with one bullet said to have grazed Mr Ephrons knuckles.\n\nMuch of the trial hinged on whether the firearm in question was a harmless prop gun, as Mr Mayerss defence said, or a real weapon capable of causing harm, as Mr Ephron and prosecutors alleged.\n\nThe weapon has not been recovered by authorities.\n\nJurors were able to watch some footage of the altercation because parts were captured on surveillance video, including audio of gunfire, but no video evidence directly showed any shooting.\n\nMr Ephron took two days before reporting the incident to authorities and brought shell casings he said he had retrieved from the scene.\n\nBut police who responded to reports of a shooting in the area did not locate any shell casings. Mr Ephron, who said he returned with his girlfriend hours later, said he knew exactly where to look, but no surveillance footage corroborates his account.\n\nHe was not admitted to hospital in Los Angeles and instead went for medical treatment after flying back to New York.\n\nLawyers for Mr Mayers suggested that Mr Ephron had planted the shell casings to frame the rapper.\n\nThe trial was marked by emotional and combative exchanges, particularly when Mr Ephron  the trials star witness  took the stand.\n\nAt one point, Mr Ephron called Mr Tacopina  a defence attorney for Mr Mayers  annoying, which led to a reprimand from the judge.\n\nAnother witness, A$AP Twelvyy, was asked by prosecutors about a photograph showing Mr Mayerss bed with the letters AWGE emblazoned on the furniture.\n\nWhen asked what that stood for, Mr Mayers unexpectedly interrupted the proceedings and yelled, Dont say! Twelvyy ultimately refused to elaborate.\n\nOutbursts from defendants during trials are uncommon, especially in front of a jury.\n\nHowever, for a criminal suspect on trial to interject and instruct a witness not to answer a prosecutors question during cross-examination is something nearly unheard of in a court.\n\nThe rapper is set to release his first solo album in nearly a decade and is scheduled to co-headline Los Angeles Rolling Loud festival in March 2025.\n\nAdditionally, he stars alongside Denzel Washington in Spike Lees upcoming film Highest 2 Lowest, due to be released the coming months.\n\n",

Therefore, the total amount paid in lieu of fines is R680 000 while the 322 employees were taken for further processing as per immigration requirements, she said.\n\nMeths response showed that Eastern Cape led the pack with 34 employers that flouted the laws and were fined a collective R340 000, followed by Mpumalanga with 15, Limpopo eight, KwaZulu-Natal five, and two in the Western Cape.\n\nShe also said of the 322 foreign employees that were arrested, the largest number, 163, were from Limpopo.\n\nThe Western Cape came second with foreign nationals at 43, Eastern Cape and Gauteng at 34 each, Mpumalanga 30, KwaZulu-Natal 16, and Free State two.\n\nIn a separate response to another set of questions, Meth said her department received 6 255 work permit applications between April 2023 and March last year.\n\nShe said the role of her department was to make recommendations on corporate work visa applications regarding the availability of local labour in various categories.\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs makes final decisions or waive any recommendation made by any of these three departments after following their final internal processes or after consulting further with other departments such as those in the security cluster.\n\nShe added that of the 60 corporate applications her department received and processed, 5 383 were rejected.\n\nA total of 872 work visas for migrant workers were recommended.\n\nThe applications were mainly from foreign nations from Zimbabwe with 445, Lesotho with 250, Mozambique 86, and Namibia 70.\n\nThe applications were for mining, agriculture, and education and training.\n\n",

We produced and paid, but we have now reached a point where we can no longer sustain it.\n\nIn addition to suspending the Lisbon route, LAM also canceled flights between Maputo and Harare, Zimbabwe, and between Maputo and Lusaka, Zambia, due to the same reason.\n\nFor the 1,080 passengers who had already purchased tickets for the flights, Cossa said, LAM will make alternative travel arrangements through agreements with other operators.\n\nOnce we have restructured and consolidated our position, we will look toward intercontinental and regional operations, the spokesperson added.\n\nThe decision to suspend international routes aligns with LAMs 100-Day Governance Plan, which seeks to assess operational performance and strengthen the quality of domestic and regional services, Cossa said.\n\nFor years, LAM has struggled with operational challenges, including a reduced fleet, lack of investment, and non-fatal incidents linked to poor aircraft maintenance.\n\nIn February, the Mozambican government approved the sale of a 91 percent state-owned stake in LAM to public companies, aiming to raise 130 million dollars for the acquisition of eight new aircraft and the airlines restructuring.\n\n",

These internal divisions have spilled into the public domain, fracturing the ruling party.\n\nSeveral government ministers, including Jenfan Muswere, Daniel Garwe, and Tinoda Machakaire, are among those backing the move to disregard the constitution by allowing Mnangagwa to remain in power until 2030.\n\nIn a recent sermon, Angel who is theAmbassador at Large to Europe and the Americas, condemned the calls by these cabinet ministers, describing them as retrogressive and damaging to Mnangagwas reputation.\n\nWe should be talking about targets for this road. Target next week. Target next week for this one. Target next week for that hospital. Target next week for this one.\n\nIf the president has already said he is not interested in [extending his term], focus on when we are putting a road here. Some of these politicians are the ones that give good people bad names because they party at night, but we, the public, get the hangover.\n\nYou dont have a place to stay. People are arguing over stupid things. Is it 2030? Is it 2033? Is it 2024? Shut up. Lets just do the work. I normally dont comment on this.\n\nWhy do you speak for the man who has already said, Im not going there. Im not interested in that? Just do your thing, said Angel.\n\nAngel made headlines in 2023 following the release of Al Jazeeras Gold Mafia documentary which exposed him as a key player in the money laundering and gold smuggling syndicate. In the expos he offered to assist undercover journalists pretending to be Chinese gangsters with money to launder.\n\nI look at the political dialogue in this country, where people are fighting. They are fighting. Who said hes going to 2030? Who said hes going to 2018? Who said hes going until 2033? From both sides, something is wrong, he added.\n\nWhile Muswere, Garwe, and Machakaire have been vocal in their push for the term extension, their performances in their respective ministerial roles have come under scrutiny for delivering lacklustre results.\n\nTheir calls also contradict Mnangagwas public declaration that he will not run for the presidency in the next elections, scheduled for 2028.\n\nHowever, Mnangagwas refusal has been questioned, as he has not publicly rebuked the faction aligned with him.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nHARARE Mayor Jacob Mafume has exposed a can of worms regarding how Council executives embezzled over US$1 million to purchase the latest vehicles in an inexplicable scheme.\n\nMafume made these revelations on Tuesday as he concluded his testimony before the Commission of Inquiry, which is investigating the operations of the Harare City Council.\n\nIn 2023, the Harare City Council (HCC) executive, led by the then Town Clerk Hosiah Chisango, purchased Toyota Fortuners using remittances from Harare City Parka subsidiary of the HCC.\n\nMafume revealed that the vehicles are being used by top officials, and no action has been taken to explain the purchase, which was made without the Councils approval.\n\nThat is one of the biggest challenges because last year City Parking brought to the City Council about a million. When we started asking where that US$1 million went that is where the problem began and I am told that the US$1 million was used to purchase executive cars or Fortuners and so forth, said Mafume.\n\nMafume told the Commission, led by retired Justice Maphios Cheda, that the purchase of the top-of-the-range vehicles was made when the Council was dissolved before the elections.\n\nIt happened towards 2023. Towards the elections. City Parking used to enforce one by-law which is the parking by-law then we made a resolution for them to enforce another by-law to give them two.\n\nThe sharing of the revenue was that they collect the revenue and we get 50 percent of that. Now because it was the first time they implemented that by-law, it raised US$2 million and the US$1 million was then remitted to the City Council.\n\nWe were going to the elections and the City Council dissolved. When we came back we said what happened with that US$1 million because we had earmarked it for doing the parking and all that. We were told that it was used. What it was used for and how it was used and we then learnt that purchases of vehicles for the Executives had been done in the time whilst we had the electioneering, he said.\n\nThe chaos currently reigning at the Town House has been attributed to the lack of a functioning Electronic Resource Planning (ERP) system.\n\nThe absence of an ERP system has resulted in financial mismanagement and unaccounted leakages of funds by the City Council.\n\nThe Commission of Inquirys evidence leader, Thabani Mpofu, revealed that executives at the Council are spending US$125,000 per year on holidays. The Town Clerk is entitled to one international trip per year, while other executives are entitled to a regional trip.\n\nThese holidays are paid for using ratepayers money, which the Council has claimed it does not have, hence the poor service delivery in the city.\n\nWhen questioned about the astronomical figures, Mafume professed ignorance, stating that he was shocked by the amounts.\n\nFrom the figures, I will have no right to dispute those figures they do not come through me. I have no access to that. I am actually shocked at the figures and the information because they come at a time when we as Councillors are being asked and everybody is being asked to tighten their belts. Others are loosening, said Mafume.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commission of Inquiry has completed its public hearings. The Commission will compile a report, which will be presented to President Emmerson Mnangagwa upon finalisation.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nZimbabwes efforts to clear landmines and explosive remnants of the war have been delayed due to a lack of funding and disruptions by the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe landmines were put in by Rhodesian colonial forces during the fight for independence in the 1970s to stop freedom fighters from moving to and from Zambia and Mozambique.\n\nThe government has been working towards achieving a landmine-free environment by December 2025 however the deadline has been pushed to 2028 due to financial challenges.\n\nSpeaking at the national stakeholders dialogue on humanitarian demining and mine victim assistance Tuesday, Defence Minister Oppah Muchinguri said changes in financial support from international donors have affected the demining project.\n\nOur projection was to complete demining by December 2025. This is no longer realisable due to challenges associated with the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and fluctuation in funding from the international donor community.\n\nAs a result, we are working on submitting another three-year extension request to the Secretariat of the Treaty.\n\nThe funding gap as at September 2024 and completion of mine clearance in Zimbabwe by 2028 was US$23.79 million. Muchinguri said.\n\nShe addedthatthe government will keep funding the demining project.\n\nOn its part, the Government of Zimbabwe will continue to fund the National Mine Clearance Unit which requires a minimum of US$2,000,000 per year.\n\nIt is our hope that deliberations during this workshop will help unlock funding for mine action in Zimbabwe as completion of mine clearance hinged on sustained funding from the government and current and new donors.\n\nCompletion of mine clearance in Zimbabwe will not only help enhance safety and security in affected communities but will also go a long way in unlocking sustainable socio-economic development, she added.\n\nSince 1980, landmines have killed or injured over 1,500 people, while more than 120,000 livestock have also died as a result.\n\nThese minefields are in six provincesMatabeleland North, Mashonaland West, Mashonaland Central, Mashonaland East, Manicaland, and Masvingocovering 310,650 square kilometers.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Commercial Workers Union of Zimbabwe (CWUZ) has implored the government to compel the informal retail sector to comply with appropriate employment standards if beneficial formalization is to see the light of day.\n\nThe calls come shortly after regional retailer Choppies Enterprise Limited (Choppies) and British multinational professional services and fast-moving consumer goods firms, PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited and Unilever plc indicatedthey wouldshut downoperations in Zimbabwe.\n\nFirms like cement manufacturer Khayah Cement Limited and clothing retailer Truworths Limited entered corporate rescue in December and August 2024, respectively.\n\nEven the most resilient brands like OK Zimbabwe which have stood the test of rough economic periods in Zimbabwe are now struggling to fill up their shelves.\n\nThe retail sector has blamed the rapid growth of informality in Zimbabwe as chief among the causes prompting unfair competition which is now pushing the formal sector out of business. The shadow economy is also enjoying easy access to foreign currency and tax evasions.\n\nIn a bid to ease informalisation of the sector, Finance Minister, Mthuli Ncube this week recommended a raft of measures which include the adoption of e-money and use of bank accounts for all businesses.\n\nBut speaking to NewZimbabwe.com, CWUZ General Secretary, Cuthbert Chikwekwete implored the government to consider compelling the informal sector to abide by appropriate labour standards if formalization is to subsist.\n\nThe formalization agenda cannot be complete if players in the shadow economy are not compelled to follow the retail sectors set standards. These tuck shop owners continue to enjoy easy operating conditions such as underemployment where they hire two or three employees and overwhelm them with mammoth tasks. Their employees are often not allowed to join trade unions and most of the business owners resist becoming a part and parcel of the National Employment Council, he said.\n\nThe workers leader also criticized the informal sector for subjecting short-staffed workers to long hours of work with poor remuneration.\n\nOne would note that at a time when OK Zimbabwe and Spar entities are contributing immensely to fiscus through Pay As You Earn (PAYE), the informal sector which creams off a huge chunk of the retail sectors profits is not injecting anything at all. The revenue leakages through the sector could be larger than anticipated, he said.\n\nChikwekwete added that there is an urgent need for the government to join hands and compel all informal players to contribute towards the fiscus and Social Protection of their workers as the nation journeys towards formalization.\n\n",
