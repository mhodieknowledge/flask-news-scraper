            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA Harare man, Moses Ruvheneko, was on Thursday remanded in custody following his court appearance on charges of attempting to disarm a security officer guarding Zimbabwe House, the official residence of President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nRuvheneko, of no fixed abode, is facing two charges, criminal trespass and disorderly conduct in a public place in violation of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act [Chapter 9:23].\n\nRuvheneko appeared before Harare magistrate Ruth Moyo, who ordered that he undergo a mental examination.\n\nProsecutors told the court that on November 4, 2025, at around 3pm, Ruvheneko unlawfully walked along Chancellor Road, where pedestrians are prohibited opposite Zimbabwe House. He reportedly approached a security officer manning the main gate and suddenly attempted to snatch his SKS rifle while shouting, Where is ED? I want to see ED.\n\nA scuffle ensued as the guard wrestled with Ruvheneko before another officer, Private Mupfumira, intervened to subdue him. During the struggle, the accused was injured on his left hand by the bayonet attached to the firearm.\n\nThe accused was arrested while in the process of committing the offence, and there are eyewitnesses who will testify linking him to the crime, the State told the court.\n\nHe was later taken to Five Avenue Police Station, where a report was filed. The State opposed bail, arguing that Ruvheneko has no known address or relatives and may interfere with witnesses if released.\n\n",

            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nGIFFORD Sibanda, the Ibhetshu LikaZulu spokesperson, has resigned from the once vibrant pressure group following revelations that Secretary General Mbuso Fuzwayo is now working hand in glove with Zanu PF to ensure President Emmerson Mnangagwas ambitions for a term extension are realised.\n\nThe group, which in the past was declared a public enemy with some of its members arrested and locked up for standing up to the Zanu PF government, is the second applicant in a Constitutional Court application veiled as an attempt to stop Mnangagwas 2030 plan.\n\nSengezo Tshabangus lawyer, Nqobile Sithole and Method Ndlovu are representing Fuzwayo and Ibhetshu LikaZulu.\n\nAccording to reports, Sibandas resignation emanates from knowledge that Fuzwayo has been tasked to challenge the illegal attempts to have Mnangagwa hang on, and lose.\n\nThis will thereby open avenues for Zanu PFs resolution to extend his second term actionably without any legal hindrances and possible challenges.\n\nThis, however, remains unconfirmed as Fuzwayos number was not going through when NewZimbabwe.com sought to get his comment on the allegations. His WhatsApp number was also not receiving messages.\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that I tender my resignation from Ibhetshu LikaZulu, effective immediately, reads Sibandas letter to Fuzwayo.\n\nThis decision comes after deep reflection on the current direction and approach the organisation has taken in the struggle against Zanu PF.\n\nUnfortunately, I find that this route diverges from my own beliefs, principles, and the foundational values that Ibhetshu LikaZulu has long stood for.\n\nThis is not an easy decision. Ibhetshu LikaZulu has been a home of conscience and courage  a movement that stood firmly with the oppressed and gave voice to the voiceless.\n\nSibanda and Fuzwayo had been comrades in arms for years, in the trenches against first late President Robert Mugabe and his harsh Zanu PF regime to the current.\n\nA resolution by Zanu PF last year mandated the partys secretary for justice to initiate the process that will extend Mnangagwas second and final term, which is supposed to end in 2028. The party wants it lengthened to 2030.\n\nThe involvement of exiled former minister in Mugabes government, Jonathan Moyo, has raised the stakes as he is a known strategist and thinker.\n\nThe resolution, which has threatened to split the revolutionary institution and riddled it with factional fights, was reinforced at its recent Peoples Conference hosted in Mutare.\n\n",
