We believe that the universitys failure to address the needs of both students and lecturers has led to this impasse.\n\nA demotivated lecturer cannot provide quality education, and it is essential that their concerns are addressed, read the letter further.\n\n",

Then we agreed to proceed with the deal, he said.\n\nAccording to Basera, Chimombe and Mpofu were advanced ZW$1,9 billion, which was equivalent to US$7,9 million.\n\nHe said the two then told the ministry that they had managed to mobilise 32,000 goats and they had kept them in holding pens.\n\nHe said when representatives went to confirm, they were shocked to find less than 3,000 goats in the holding pens.\n\nBasera said the ministry wanted Chimombe and Mpofu to pay back the money or supply the goats as agreed.\n\nAnother option was to call for a guarantee.\n\nHearing continues Friday with the duos lawyers cross-examining Basera.\n\n",
