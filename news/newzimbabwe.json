Trying to turn a thief into a leader is the ultimate betrayal of the revolutionary party by a reactionary leader. The game has begun, and that rimming mouth will not be opened again.\n\nWhen a frog wakes up in ZANU-PFs Central Committee, it thinks all other positions are acquired by leaping! A historic party has been reduced to a rent-seeking, positions-for-sale party. How does a whole NPC [National Political Commissar] Machacha subordinate himself to a crook? Hurombo Huroyi, wrote Kasukuwere.\n\nBusinessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei(Photo credit JEKESAI NJIKIZANA/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nTagwirei, a close ally of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, is reportedly eyeing the ZANU PF leadership when Mnangagwas constitutional term expires in 2028.\n\nThe businessman has been criss-crossing the country, hosting ZANU PF events, a move political observers describe as an attempt to galvanise support within the ruling party.\n\nHe has denied ambitions to succeed Mnangagwa, instead pushing for the presidents term to be extended beyond the constitutional two-term limit.\n\nBiti, who has been vocal against Tagwireis potential rise to power, said an audit should be conducted to trace funds the businessman allegedly gained through opaque government contracts.\n\nWe stand firm on principle & on deep-rooted values that have defined us for decades. We will never allow charlatans & crooks to take over the State, to emasculate the Constitution, or to buy their way into office. Criminals must know that one day soon, Zimbabwe will rise, and crooks will fall.\n\nA New Zimbabwe must audit all Treasury Bills issued by the Government in the last 20 years. Billions have been illicitly siphoned off in opaque transactions done outside parliamentary scrutiny. One crook has been awarded more TBs than any other entity in Zimbabwe. Its time for this audit! said Biti.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) has said the lack of funding to manage elephants in its game reserves is negatively impacting elephant conservation efforts, leading to increased human-wildlife conflict.\n\nThe authority is working with a budget of US$500,000 at its biggest game reserve, Hwange National Park, against the required US$21 million to manage the ever-increasing elephant population.\n\nZimParks recently hosted a review and updating workshop on the Zimbabwe Elephant Management Plan (2021-2025) to assess implementation of the plan, emerging issues, evaluate management approaches, and exploring effective strategies from past experiences which was for the first time attended by chiefs from Hwange.\n\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, ZimParks spokesperson Tinashe Farawo said chiefs complained that their affected communities have not benefited from their proximity to the wildlife.\n\nThe chiefs expressed their concerns on the lack of tangible benefits for communities who bear the brunt of sharing borders with elephants and a relief fund for injured community people.\n\nThe traditional leaders expressed concerns over the ongoing poverty faced by these communities, worsened by crop raiding, resource competition, and incidents of injury and property damage caused by elephants, he said.\n\nThe increased elephant populations and localised overabundance have resulted in increased human-elephant conflicts.\n\nAccording to Farawo, while this is happening, ZimParks efforts to curb the crisis are dampened by a lack of resources.\n\nThe countrys elephant conservation efforts are severely under-financed, with the current budget for Hwange National Park falling below US$500,000 annually, compared to the estimated US$21 million required based on management costs in other well-managed protected areas in Southern Africa, he said.\n\nFarawo also said sustainable utilisation is hindered by various factors, including global trade restrictions.\n\nMeanwhile, while elephant poaching for ivory has declined, effective partnerships have played a vital role in enhancing conservation efforts.\n\nFarawo said elephant conservation requires collective efforts from all stakeholders.\n\nZimbabwe has the second-largest elephant population in the world, with an estimated 82,000 elephants.\n\nWhile Zimbabwe is lauded for its conservation efforts, the elephant population is growing faster than the environment can sustain, leading to human-wildlife conflict and habitat degradation.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nLocal property developer Leengate (Private) Limited has been ordered by the High Court to vacate within 30 days land on which quarrying operations were taking place at Rainham Farm after it emerged that the company encroached on someones property.\n\nLeengate was being sued by Mitchell Corporation Private Limited for encroaching on its Stand No 643.\n\nIn the present application, Mitchell Corporation applied for a summary judgment in an action for eviction and removal of structures.\n\nAccording to the applicant, Leengate or its agents erected buildings or other structures on the applicants land without any legal right, permission, or lease agreement.\n\nMitchell Corporation sought a summary order for the ejectment of Leengate and anyone claiming through it from the property, as well as the demolition or removal of all structures erected on the land.\n\nLeengate wanted the matter to go to a full trial.\n\nThe second respondent, Zvimba Rural District Council, is the local authority for the area; it was cited given its administrative interest in the land, though no specific relief beyond its formal citation is sought against it.\n\nLeengate denied having encroached into Mitchell Corporations land and claimed that one LLH Engineering Projects (Pvt) Ltd  is the true occupier/builder on the land in question.\n\nLeengate claimed that the applicant sued the wrong party.\n\nZvimba RDC did not file any opposing affidavit and took a neutral position, indicating it will abide by the Courts decision.\n\nAfter hearing the parties High Court judge, Justice Joel Mambara, ruled in favour of the applicant and ordered Leengate and its agents out before slapping the developer with costs on a legal practitioner-client scale.\n\nThe judge said it was noteworthy that Leengate provided virtually no detail about LLH Engineering Projects (Pvt) Ltd, apart from naming it as the alleged occupier.\n\nThe opposing affidavit does little more than assert the structures belong to LLH, not us. It does not explain the relationship (if any) between the first respondent and LLH Engineering  for example, whether LLH is a completely independent third party that coincidentally built on Stand 643, or perhaps a subcontractor or business partner of the first respondent in the Rainham development project.\n\nThe first respondent did not tender any affidavit from LLH Engineering, nor any documentary proof (such as an agreement, a council lease, or correspondence) indicating that LLH Engineering was authorised by the Council or anyone else to build on Stand 643. One would expect that if LLH Engineering truly and independently moved onto Stand 643, the first respondent could at least describe how that came about  especially since Leengate itself is involved in development projects in the same locale (indeed, the Rainham Park housing development has been linked to Leengate in the background).\n\nThe stark absence of any supporting detail or third-party confirmation raises serious doubt about the genuineness of this defence, said the judge.\n\nMambara said Leengates mere pointing of the finger at a non-party, without more, is arguably the kind of bald or sketchy averment that fails to pass muster as a bona fide defence.\n\nIt is therefore an appropriate exercise of this Courts discretion to order costs against the first respondent on the legal practitioner and client scale.\n\nSuch an order ensures that the applicant is more fully indemnified for the legal expenses it incurred due to the first respondents conduct, and it serves as a rebuke of the first respondents abuse of the court process.\n\nThe applicant should not be out of pocket for having to chase a party that had no valid defence and yet refused to concede.\n\nMambara said the applicant met the requirements for summary judgment, and the first respondent has failed to establish a bona fide defence or triable issue.\n\nThe first respondent, Leengate (Private) Limited, and all persons claiming occupation through the first respondent, be and are hereby ejected from Stand 643 Rainham Farm, Zvimba District, Mashonaland West.\n\nThis eviction encompasses the removal of any employees, contractors, agents, or associates of the first respondent, and includes any other entity (such as LLH Engineering Projects (Pvt) Ltd) or persons who occupy the property under or through the authority of the first respondent.\n\nThe first respondent shall, within 30 days of service of this order upon it, remove all structures, buildings, materials, plant, equipment and installations that it or anyone acting on its behalf (or through it) has erected or placed on Stand 643 Rainham Farm.\n\nThe removal shall be carried out safely and without avoidable damage to the land, and the site shall be restored, as far as reasonably possible, to its original condition prior to the first respondents occupation, said the judge.\n\nMambara also ruled that in the event that Leengate or those claiming occupation through it have not vacated the property or have not fully complied with paragraph 2 within the stipulated 30-day period, the Sheriff of the High Court or his lawful Deputy is hereby authorised and directed to evict the first respondent and any other unlawful occupiers from Stand 643 Rainham Farm.\n\nThe Sheriff was further authorised and directed to demolish, dismantle and/or remove any structures or materials remaining on the property that were erected or placed thereon by the first respondent or its agents, and to restore possession of the property to the applicant.\n\nHe said the Sheriff may enlist the assistance of the Zimbabwe Republic Police and/or the second respondent (Zvimba Rural District Council) to the extent necessary to carry out this order and ensure compliance in a peaceful and safe manner.\n\nThe RDC was ordered to cooperate with and facilitate the enforcement of this order to the extent that any administrative action or permission on its part is required.\n\nDuring the hearing, in support of its claim, the applicant proved that for instance, in mid-2024 when the encroachment was discovered, communications were exchanged involving the council and the first respondent.\n\nNotably, an email dated 15 July 2024 from the Council addressed to the applicant and copied to a representative of the first respondent (one K. Bhunu)  confirmed that a council inspection had found a durawall (boundary wall) built by the occupier of adjacent Stand 179 was indeed encroaching onto the applicants Stand 643.\n\nThe Council in that email reported the encroachment and indicated that the occupier of Stand 179 had been instructed to rectify the anomaly (remove or realign the wall).\n\nThe following day, 16 July 2024, the applicants legal practitioners sent a letter of demand to Leengate formally complaining of the encroachment.\n\nIn response, by 27 July 2024, Leengates legal practitioners replied in writing  effectively acknowledging the encroachment and proposing a resolution.\n\nIn that letter, Leengates lawyers confirmed they also represented LLH Engineering Projects (Pvt) Ltd (a company closely associated with the first respondent) and explained that these two companies held the adjacent Stands 179 and 644, with the applicants Stand 643 lying between them.\n\nThe letter further indicated that those entities were operating a quarry on Stand 179 and proposed a compromise arrangement: they suggested a re-pegging (boundary adjustment) that would reduce the applicants land in order to cure the encroachment, with the first respondent financing the re-survey, or alternatively an outright purchase of Stand 643 from the applicant.\n\nIn essence, Leengate at that stage offered to compensate for or eliminate the encroachment by realigning property boundaries or buying the land, implicitly conceding that an encroachment had occurred.\n\nDespite these discussions and the first respondents written undertakings to rectify the situation, nothing was actually done on the ground to remove the offending structures or resolve the issue.\n\nEventually, frustrated by the lack of concrete remedial action, the applicant issued a summons out of this Court (leading to the present proceedings).\n\nLeengates plea to the summons, however, painted a very different picture.\n\nIn its plea, Leengate denied that it was encroaching on the applicants land  offering little more than bare denials, and notably made no mention of LLH Engineering or the earlier communications and admissions.\n\nAfter the applicant filed this summary judgment application, in its opposing affidavit to the application, Leengate then raised the new defence that LLH Engineering Projects (Pvt) Ltd, not Leengate, was the party responsible for the structures on Stand 643.\n\nThe court said this shift in position  from tacitly acknowledging encroachment and attempting a compromise, to later denying any responsibility and blaming a third party marred Leengates defence.\n\n",
