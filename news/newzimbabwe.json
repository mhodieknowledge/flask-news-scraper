            "content": "BBC\n\nHuge crowds of mourners in Kenya fled screaming after police fired gunshots and tear gas in a stadium where they had gathered to see the body of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga.\n\nSeveral people at the arena, located in the capital Nairobi, were reportedly injured in the chaos as security officers sought to disperse the surging crowds.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether the police were using live ammunition or rubber bullets.\n\nOdingas body was flown back from India, where he died on Wednesday morning. Thousands of supporters had earlier travelled to the countrys main airport to receive the coffin, in an outpouring of grief that forced a brief halt to flights.\n\nThe authorities said mourners had gained access to restricted areas, prompting a precautionary closure that lasted about two hours.\n\nFrom the airport, thousands of people moved in a procession to escort the vehicle carrying the body to the stadium, about 10km (six miles) from the city centre.\n\nBecause of the unexpectedly large crowds, the public viewing ceremony for Odingas body was moved to Nairobis Moi International Sports Centre in the Kasarani neighbourhood, rather than inside the parliament building where it was initially scheduled to take place.\n\nThe convoy arrived to a packed stadium, with more people waiting outside.\n\nMinutes afterwards, a large crowd breached a gate in the arena, prompting the police to fire tear gas. Masses of mourners rushed towards the exits in response.\n\nA BBC reporter at the scene also saw men in civilian clothing beating protesters with batons.\n\nAt least three people were visibly injured and one had a serious head wound, the AFP news agency reported.\n\nAfter the chaos had settled, government officials and dignitaries were able to view it the coffin.\n\nA stream of supporters had earlier gathered at Lee Funeral Home, where the body was first expected, and around parliament.\n\nI came here at six in the morning. We have been at the airport to welcome Baba [Odingas nickname], one mourner had told the BBC near the airport.\n\nWe are sad, we have been left as orphans. He is our father.\n\nMotorcycle rider William Otieno Adoyo said he was a Baba die-hard.\n\nWe want to see Baba, how do we know its him in the casket? Let them show us and well be contented, he told the BBC.\n\nMourners have been carrying twigs and palm branches, a symbol of mourning and grief among the Luo ethnic group that Odinga belonged to.\n\nThe state funeral will be held at the Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi on Friday and on Saturday his body will be transported to Kisumu, a city in western Kenya on the shores of Lake Victoria  his political stronghold.\n\nMembers of the public will get a chance to view the body before he is buried on Sunday at his farm in Bondo, about 60km west of Kisumu.\n\nAccording to the family, it was Odingas wish to be laid to rest within the shortest time possible, ideally within 72 hours.\n\nThe 80-year-old former prime minister collapsed during a morning walk in India on Wednesday morning and he was taken to Devamatha Hospital, about 50km (30 miles) east of the port city of Kochi.\n\nA seven-day period of mourning has been declared. Odinga will also be accorded a state funeral with full military honours, Kenyan President William Ruto said.\n\nHe was towering figure in Kenyan politics and for many years was the countrys main opposition leader, losing five presidential campaigns, most recently three years ago.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nSelf-imposed Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) Secretary General Sengezo Tshabangu is spearheading a plan to suspend the 2028 general elections, a move that would effectively extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas stay in power.\n\nAccording to Ziyambi, the proposal contained in a document titled Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) seeks to amend Section 92 of the Constitution to allow for the suspension of general elections.\n\nIf enacted, the amendment would pave the way for Mnangagwas term to be extended beyond the constitutional limit.\n\nZiyambi, however, dismissed claims linking Jonathan Moyo and businessmen Kudakwashe Tagwirei and Pedzai Sakupwanya to the alleged plot, insisting that the initiative originated from Tshabangu.\n\nThe BBI is an opposition document which was initially brought to my attention by the leader of the opposition in Parliament, Sengezo Tshabangu, in the company of a General Khumalo from the Vice Presidents Office.\n\nAs a Party, we should appreciate the relationship with the opposition, which has been beneficial to us. There is no proof whatsoever that the BBI Project is being funded by the named individuals. It appears the author is more seized with it and would have assisted us by unpacking it further, said Ziyambi.\n\nThe move has deepened tensions within Zanu PF, angering a faction backing Vice President Constantino Chiwenga as Mnangagwas successor.\n\nThis has created a tense atmosphere at the National Peoples Conference, which is being held in Mutare and is expected to cement last years resolution number one, extending Mnangagwas term.\n\nZiyambi further defended the BBI, describing it as a nation-building initiative rather than a treasonous plot.\n\nIt is surprising how the writer got hold of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) document if it was meant for Parliament. This tendency of stalking officials who are carrying out their duties is regrettable.\n\nThere is nothing treasonous about improving a political system. This BBI, which is being referred to, is not strange to us, and its actually promoting nation building and cohesion as compared to the authors divisive and inciteful document, said Ziyambi.\n\n",

            "content": "ESPN\n\nZimbabwesNate Landmanset a franchise tackles record for theLos Angeles Ramsin their 17-3 win over theBaltimore Ravensas Week 6 saw African players dominate on defense.\n\nTheSeattle SeahawksJaxon Smith-Njigbawas the one shining light on offense this week, but after coming flying out of the blocks at the start of the season, wide receivers with ties to the continent generally had a more quiet round.\n\nArguably more than any before, this week showed that the NFLs attempts to grow the sport in Africa are bearing fruit  both in terms of developments on and off the field.\n\nThe impenetrable Landman  born in Harare  set a Rams franchise record with 17 total tackles in their win over the Ravens, including a quarterback hit and eight solo tackles.\n\nA convert from rugby, former Colorado Buffaloes linebacker Landman had arguably the best game of his American football career in the Rams win. His defining moment came on the stroke of half-time, as he contributed to two crucial stops within 10 yards of the end zone, as well as another earlier tackle in the same drive which saw the Rams held up over the course of eight plays.\n\nAt the time, the scores were deadlocked at 3-3. The Rams defense, led by Landman, prevented the Ravens from taking control at a crucial point in the game. In the third quarter, the Rams themselves took charge and never looked back.\n\nWhat a stop by our guys, really buckling up there,Landman told Tom Bradyfor Fox Sports after the legendary quarterback selected him as his LFG Player of the Game. Thats the pride of the defense right there, how you play goal line, and we rose up to the occasion. Way to set the tone for the rest of the game.\n\nSmith-Njigba, who has ties to Sierra Leone through his grandfather, is on a run where everything he touches turns to gold  and much of what he touches turns to touchdowns.\n\nThe wide receiver scored a 61-yard touchdown in the Seattle Seahawks 20-12 win over theJacksonville Jaguars. It came at a crucial time, too, as the Seahawks had been 6-3 behind midway through the second quarter before he crept in behind the defense and latched onto aSam Darnoldpass.\n\nAlthough Landman walks away with Africas MVP honors this week as far as we are concerned, Smith-Njigba is the most likely candidate from the continent to be in the running for NFL MVP a the end of the season.\n\nSmith-Njigba made a total of eight catches for 162 yards. Although there were many other moments worth celebrating from players with ties to Africa in week 6  notably a hugely impressive 72-yard kick return fromKene Nwangwu(ties to Nigeria) in theNew York Jets defeat to theDenver Broncos there was ultimately nobody who could top Smith-Njigba in terms of a notable single play.\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nUchenna Nwosu who has family ties to Nigeria  got 1.5 sacks for the Seahawks in their win over the Jaguars.\n\nNigeria-born duoDavid OnyemataandRuke Orhorhoroeach picked up a sack as theAtlanta Falconsupset theBuffalo Bills24-14.Charles Omenihu who has ties to Nigeria through his parents  got one for theKansas City Chiefsas they gained a crucial 30-17 win over theDetroit Lions.\n\nEyioma Uwazurike who also has parental ties to Nigeria  made a sack for the Denver Broncos in their narrow win over the New York Jets.\n\nOdafe Oweh raised in a Nigerian household in New Jersey  also had a memorable Sunday as he got a sack on debut for theLos Angeles Chargersin their 29-27 win over theMiami Dolphins. Oweh was recently traded from the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nWeek 6 was one to remember for African-born players, with few if any that can compare in recent memory. Landman (born in Zimbabwe), Onyemata, Orhorhoro (both born in Nigeria) and Paye (born in Guinea) all had performances to remember.\n\nThere was a crucial development off the field, too, as Nigerian International Player Pathway (IPP) Program standout Basil Chijioke CJ Okoye was officially signed to the Baltimore Ravens active roster from their practice squad shortly before his third straight NFL regular season appearance.\n\nOkoye and the Ravens may have ended up on the losing side against Landmans Rams, but he  just as much as the Zimbabwean  will remember the weekend for years to come.\n\n",

The bottles of medication were found on the accident scene, a few kilometres outside Makhado.\n\nThe inquiry comes as police explore potential contraventions of the countrys drug laws. According to the SAPS statement, Section 22A of the Medicines and Related Substances Act in South Africa makes it a crime to possess certain scheduled medicines without proper authorization.\n\nProvincial commissioner of police in Limpopo, Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe. Image: SAPS\n\nLegally, someone is only permitted to possess and carry the quantity of medicine you have been prescribed by an authorized prescriber. Carrying a large quantity of medicine without exception is illegal, provincial police spokesperson, Colonel Malesela Ledwaba said.\n\nWhile the lawful owner of the medication has not yet been identified, police are treating the find seriously as their investigation into the cause of the fatal crash continues.\n\nThe tragedy occurred on Sunday, October 13, when a cross-border bus, reportedly travelling from Gqeberha to Zimbabwe and Malawi, veered off the mountainous road on the N1 and plunged down an embankment. The death toll rose to 43, with scores of other passengers injured.\n\nAlthough for now the lawful owner of the bottles of medication is not yet identified to get the explanation regarding its origin, the police have, in the meantime, opened an inquiry for further investigation, said Ledwaba.\n\nAnyone or the lawful owner of the medication is requested to contact the nearest police, call the SAPS toll-free number 08600 10111 or use the My SAPS App.\n\nVisuals seen on television news channels showed bottles of what appears to be BronCleer spewed among the luggage at the crash scene. The images and videos have sparked outrage, with many social media users accusing foreign nationals of looting South Africas health system.\n\nOn Tuesday,IOL reported that health authorities have moved to quash viral social media claims that South Africas public healthcare system is distributing BronCleer, a codeine-based cough syrup, insisting the medication is strictly controlled and only available through private or illegal channels.\n\nThe clarification comes amid a police bust in Kimberley that uncovered a stash of unregistered medicines  including BronCleer  being sold unlawfully by unlicensed operators.\n\nCity of Tshwanes MMC for Health Services, Tshegofatso Mashabela, has dismissed claims circulating on social media about public healthcare facilities in South Africa distributing BronCleer, a codeine-based cough syrup.\n\nMashabela clarified that BronCleer is a controlled substance and not included in the official formularies or procurement lists of any government hospitals or clinics.\n\n",

This prompted the ZWPSL, led by chairperson Chido Chizondo, to request written confirmation of Magayas support and proof that funds had been deposited into the clubs account.\n\nDespite reportedly meeting these conditions, the league remained silent, later indicating that the matter had been referred to the ZIFA national board.\n\nThe saga came to an end on Wednesday morning when Maningi Queens announced that their bid for readmission had been officially rejected.\n\nWe would want to announce that MYSA has now been formally dismissed from the ZWPSL following our request to rejoin, despite finding a big sponsor willing to help us now and in the following seasons.\n\nIt is a very sad day for womens football as the livelihoods of many young players, support personnel, and the technical team are at immediate risk. Moreover, this situation could seriously derail the momentum of womens football development in the country at a time when there is a national push towards grassroots football, girl-child mass participation, and rebuilding Zimbabwean football, read part of the Maningi Queens statement.\n\nThe club further criticised what it described as unprofessional conduct by some womens football administrators in handling their case.\n\nIt is also very worrying how constitution violations have become a disturbing habit among some individuals entrusted with leadership positions in womens football across the country. This continues to highlight a growing culture in which personal interests and unilateral decision-making overshadow the principles of accountability, transparency, and fairness.\n\nWe are stronger together and we hope that one day ZIFA will roll out urgent reforms and stronger oversight mechanisms to protect our loved sport and the vulnerable.\n\n",
