            "content": "By AFP\n\nUS President Donald Trump cut short a meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday and said the Ukrainian leader is not ready for peace with Russia in an extraordinary meltdown in the Oval Office that threw question marks over chances for a truce.\n\nZelensky was meant to be making a full White House visit to sign a US-Ukrainian deal for joint exploitation of Ukraines mineral resources, as part of a post-war recovery in a US-brokered peace deal.\n\nInstead, an ugly clash blew up almost immediately in the Oval Office where Trump and Vice President JD Vance shouted at Zelensky, accusing him of not being thankful for US help in the three-year war against Russian invasion.\n\nTrump berated Zelensky, telling him to be more thankful and that without US assistance Ukraine would have been conquered by Russia.\n\nYoure either going to make a deal or were out, Trump added.\n\nAnd if were out, youll fight it out and I dont think its going to be pretty.\n\nZelensky left in his motorcade shortly after, without holding a planned joint press conference. The resources deal was left unsigned, the White House said.\n\nTrump took to his Truth Social platform to castigate Zelensky saying he disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office.\n\nZelensky is not ready for peace, Trump wrote.\n\nHe can come back when he is ready for peace.\n\nCompromise row\n\nThe extraordinary meltdown came after Trump said Ukraine will have to make compromises in a truce with Russia, which has occupied swaths of Ukraine, destroying entire cities and towns along the way.\n\nYou cant do any deals without compromises. So certainly, hes going to have to make some compromises, but hopefully they wont be as big as some people think, Trump said.\n\nBut showing Trump pictures of war atrocities and referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Zelensky said there should be no compromises with a killer on our territory.\n\nCrazy Russians, he said, deported Ukrainian children and committed war crimes during their three-year invasion of his country.\n\nThe dramatic public breakdown in the long-tense relationship between Zelensky and Trump came after their meeting  in front of a large group of journalists  had appeared to get off to a friendlier start.\n\nZelensky had said, I think President Trump is on our side.\n\nTruce talks in doubt\n\nThe clash left in doubt efforts led by Trump to cast himself as mediator in the war.\n\nThe leaders of France and Britain also came to the White House this week, seeking to persuade Trump not to take the Russian line and to bolster US support for Ukraine in a future truce.\n\nAfter the drama in the White House, Polands Prime Minister Donald Tusk told Zelensky: You are not alone.\n\nTrump has alarmed Kyiv and European allies with his abrupt U-turn in US policy, ending what had been full-throated support for Ukraines attempt to defeat the Russian invasion and casting himself as a mediator between Putin and Zelensky.\n\nTrump said in the Oval Office that he had spoken on numerous occasions to Putin  more than has been publicly reported beyond the lengthy call between the two leaders earlier this February.\n\nSpeaking before the shouting match erupted, Trump told Zelensky that a truce is fairly close.\n\nThe US leader also said that the proposed minerals deal would be very fair.\n\nThe proposal was to give Washington financial benefits for helping Ukraine in a truce, even if Trump has repeatedly refused to commit any US military force as a back-up to European troops who might act as peacekeepers.\n\nDictator without elections\n\nThe clash came after Trump has flip-flopped in his tone on Zelensky.\n\nTrump called him a dictator last week and has repeatedly blamed Ukraine for Russias February 2022 invasion and echoed a series of Kremlin talking points about how the war started.\n\nBut on Thursday, Trump said at a joint press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer: I have a lot of respect for him.\n\nWere going to get along really well, he said.\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly expressed admiration for Putin, said this week he trusts Putin to keep his word on any ceasefire.\n\nSenate Democrats accused Trump and Vance of siding with Putin.\n\nThey are doing Putins dirty work. Senate Democrats will never stop fighting for freedom and democracy, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer posted on social media.\n\nDisgraceful, said Senator Chris Van Hollen.\n\nAs tensions between Moscow and Washington escalated, Russias assault on Ukraine continued.\n\nRussian infantry were on Friday storming the Ukrainian border from the Russian region of Kursk, near areas of the region that were seized last summer by Ukrainian forces, Kyiv said Friday.\n\n",

Hes just a journalist practicing his profession, which is constitutionally protected, just like you guys are doing here, broadcasting to the public at home.\n\nYou cant be accused of inciting the public for broadcasting what Im saying right now.\n\nI am the one who should be brought before the courts, not the journalists who transmit the information. So, Im disappointed in that regard, but this is the reality that we are in right now, Ncube said.\n\nThe media entrepreneur said he was disappointed that Mhlanga was denied bail, pointing to selective application of the law and also accused the court of failing to appreciate that there should be freedom of the press.\n\nHe also accused Mnangagwa of controlling the judiciary, noting that the President literally owns the courts.\n\nI think fundamentally important is the fact that there wasnt any indication that the court realises that youre dealing with freedom of expression and press freedom, and that Blessed did not say any of the stuff that he is alleged to have said.\n\nUnfortunately, President Mnangagwa owns the courts. They have said they own the military; they own the police, they will do as they please. We will continue; I mean, Im sure the lawyers will do what is right, but what we saw happening today is not fair; It is not justice, and our Constitution does not support what has just taken place here, Ncube said.\n\nMhlanga was denied bail by Harare Magistrate Farai Gwitima, who ruled that he was likely to interfere with witnesses who are his subordinates.\n\nThe magistrate also said his release will jeopardise peace in Zimbabwe, among other reasons.\n\nHis lawyer Chris Mhike said he will be filing an appeal at the High Court as soon as possible.\n\nMhlanga will be back in court March 14 for routine remand.\n\n",

This is very important because when you look at these committees, they play an oversight role.\n\nWhen issues are discussed in a chamber like this, decisions are made at that level. But when decisions do not originate from there, we create room for corruption. We create room for the bleeding of council resources, said Akili.\n\nGeo Pomona was established in 2022 after a Dutch waste management firm, Geogenix BV, secured a US$350 million waste-to-energy deal with the city.\n\nGeo Pomonas operations with Harare have been a source of contention among residents amid new information that the firms local focal person, Delish Nguwaya, and President Emmerson Mnangagwas son, have 50-50 percent shares in the company.\n\nInitially, Town House opposed granting permission for Geo Pomona to take over its dumping sites but has since changed its stance, agreeing to work together to clear the dump sites.\n\nGeo Pomona Waste Management will collect 650 tonnes of refuse daily at a rate of US$40 per tonne.\n\nDespite objections from residents, Geo Pomonas projects have been dubbed a model to emulate in other cities by the government.\n\nMafume, once a vocal critic of Geo Pomona, told residents that private partnerships such as this one will transform the CoH.\n\nLet us be clear, there are certain things that can be done better if we work with the private sector. I do understand that initially, the dump site was an issue of contention, even for me, but if you go there now, the place is clean.\n\nThe place has no smell. The place has been effectively managed. If you remember, we, as the residents or as the city council at that time, said we would not pay, and the payment was done from the central fiscus. They have sorted the place out, and the residents did not have to pay.\n\nThat is a model that seems to work. We might have issues with it, but those are issues that we can address, said Mafume.\n\n",

I have learnt that freedom is free. It comes at a cost and sometimes a painful one.\n\nI have learnt that free speech, free talk is not free and, therefore, we must never stop at anything to achieve it. It must be achieved in our generation, not the next.\n\nIt is clear to me that without acting we wont achieve anything so act we must. I will take the lead; therefore, I have instructed my lawyers to take action.\n\nI have learnt that justice is a myth but just a tool used by those in power to entrench self. At law school Munyaradzi Gwisai told me that you can never understand law fully unless you understand its origins.\n\nI fully agree, save to add that you will never fully understand it until its applied to you unjustly and with impunity by the social elites.\n\nThere is a mile of difference between writing about injustice and experiencing it. My friends and I now have the benefit of it both. L Madhuku says law is law coz its law. Just or unjust. My experience teaches me that an unjust law is no law.\n\nDear friends, prison is meant to break you. It is meant to change you. I have learnt quite to the contrary. Prison makes you more resolute. I am stronger and I identify more with you ever than before.\n\nThey say when you are arrested you are alone. Thats not true. I was never alone; your voices were with me. I stood proud in the dark hours, my wife, my family were with me. I thank you.\n\nTo those behind my persecution, including prosecution aiding and abetting injustice, I wish to say the sun will set. It wont last forever. I am and I remain Dhara B.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nPRESTIGIOUS Anglican-run institution, Peterhouse Boys School (PHB) has once again torched a storm on the back of rampant allegations of victimisation of black teachers and learners in favour of the whites.\n\nIn 2020, the private school made headlines for similar allegations following an outcry by black teachers and students, who experienced segregation bordered on racial grounds.\n\nRecently, some disgruntled staff members at the institution anonymously told NewZimbabwe.com that all was not well at one of the countrys elite schools after recently appointed Head of Studies at the school was tasked to cleanse black teachers by levelling trumped up charges.\n\nA number of black teachers are currently undergoing hearings while some have been dismissed and replaced by white teachers on flimsy charges. Imagine the institution is recruiting teachers from as far as Australia despite vast local talent available.\n\nIt appears that the school has an unwritten strategy to attract more white students. They want to follow the trend at other schools with more white by the tactic of eliminating black teachers who are now seen as a stumbling block to attract such a clientele, one insider alleged.\n\nAnother insider alleged that teaching conditions are tougher for black teachers, who are often loaded with more work but are given lesser periods to teach their subjects in a development suspected to be aimed at setting up to fail the students and subsequently justify dismissals.\n\nOn the other hand, white staffers often enjoy lighter loads and more teaching periods for their subjects to justify their efficiency in results outcomes.\n\nAt the core of the problems bedeviling the revered institution is also the issue of dismal Ordinary and Advanced Level performance at Peterhouse Boys in the 2024 sitting after allegedly scoring a 77.6% as compared to 96% plus for the Peterhouse Girls School.\n\nThe insiders contend that all is well at the girls division because there are more white teachers and students compared to the boys division, where there are more blacks prompting suspicion that the need to get rid of blacks is causing the mayhem.\n\nBlack teachers are alleged to be earning a gross salary of less than US$1,500 raising suspicions that the white teachers coming from as far as Australia and the UK could be earning much higher.\n\nThe schools top management has been very economical with information on the actual pass rates at Porterhouse Boys School. So far, it appears that three different sets of pass rates were shared with parents, the teachers and school administration.\n\nI hear the PHB parents sent a letter of complaint over the dismal performance and the rector sent out an email apologising and confirming the bad performance, another insider alleged.\n\nSome of the disgruntled management members now suspect that the poor performance could be influenced by the racial bias in the employment pattern, which is favouring the white teachers even when they are not so competent.\n\nContacted for comment and challenged to share his side of the story on the cocktail of allegations, Peterhouse Group of Schools Rector, Jon Trafford said the institution upholds the highest standards of transparency as he dismissed the concerns.\n\nThe Peterhouse Group is not in the habit of disclosing information which may impinge on the privacy of its staff. There are very clear policies within the school relating to the management of staff welfare and well-being.\n\nOn examination results, the school has always been entirely transparent with its results and the details of these have been circulated to parents. There should be no, at all three levels of public examination, confusion with respect to our 2024 results, Trafford said.\n\nHe noted that any suggestion there is a relationship between fees and examinations results would be tenuous and lacks insight into the determinants of academic success within schools.\n\nWe value feedback but, equally, understand that not all the information, in the public domain, may represent the facts on the ground within the school, added Trafford.\n\n",

They have made it clear that we must lead the charge in ensuring that the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe steps down immediately, and we are in agreement, said Mathibela.\n\nWe have countless reasons to justify this.

First game in the league. You start that with a win. You can not ask for much. What is important for us is we have taken off.\n\nI must admit it was difficult, and we always knew it was going to be difficult. Despite having a galaxy of stars in our team and I think it is important to understand that football is a process, said Ndiraya after the match.\n\nScottland face Harare giants CAPS United Im their next game at Rufaro.\n\n",
