            "content": "IOL\n\nThe death toll fromSundays horrific bus crash on the N1 north near Makhado(formerly Louis Trichardt) has risen to 42, Limpopo Premier Dr Phophi Ramathuba confirmed.\n\nMost of the victims were Zimbabwean and Malawian nationals travelling home from Gqeberha (Port Elizabeth) in the Eastern Cape.\n\nThe DNC bus reportedly veered off a mountainous section of the N1 and plunged down an embankment. Emergency services, including paramedics, transport officers, and law enforcement officials, responded swiftly, recovering the deceased and transporting injured passengers to nearby hospitals.\n\nPremier Ramathuba is scheduled to visit the crash site at 11 am on Monday to meet the multi-disciplinary emergency team for updates. She will later address the media and visit hospitals where the injured are receiving care.\n\nThis is a heartbreaking tragedy. Losing so many lives in one incident is painful beyond words. On behalf of the Limpopo Provincial Government, we extend our deepest condolences to the affected families, including those in Zimbabwe and Malawi. We wish a full and speedy recovery to all survivors. Our thoughts and prayers are with them during this difficult time, Ramathuba said.\n\nEarlier, Limpopo Transport MEC Violet Mathye confirmed that the deceased included a 10-month-old baby. She said driver fatigue or a possible mechanical fault could have caused the bus to lose control, though investigations are ongoing.\n\nThe N1 freeway was temporarily closed following the crash. Motorists were advised to use alternative routes: from Makhado to Musina via the Witvlag turnoff, and from Musina to Makhado via the Williespoort turnoff.\n\nThe tragedy follows reports that the bus carried passengers from Zimbabwe and Malawi who were returning home for personal reasons. Rescue operations continued late into Sunday evening, with law enforcement and transport officials coordinating efforts alongside disaster management teams.\n\nThe Limpopo government is also providing psychosocial support to survivors and working with consular services from Zimbabwe and Malawi to assist affected families. Traffic authorities and the South African Police Service continue to investigate the cause of the crash.\n\n",

As we speak, as the Zanu PF leadership and well-wishers, we have raised almost US$4 million, with US$2 million coming from the leadership, Muchinguri-Kashiri was quoted saying.\n\nThey have surpassed all our expectations, so thank you to Zanu PF Manicaland. Last week, I reported that we only had 5 percent (of preparations) to attend to, to make sure that we are 100 percent ready.\n\nI can safely say we are good to go. Everything is 100 percent ready. We are all ready to go. The first is the well-furnished main hall. The offices were also not quite ready, but now they are ready, well-furnished, and we are very happy, said Muchinguri-Kashiri.\n\nShe hinted that the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) had been ordered to ensure uninterrupted power supplies throughout the conference. All roads leading to the venue have been rehabilitated, while enough food has also been made available.\n\nThe party national chairperson added that leftovers after feeding 5,000 delegates will be donated to hospitals, orphanages and other institutions that require assistance, as is tradition.\n\nAll the food; in fact, we can feed 10,000 people from the donations that were made, she said.\n\nThe traditional Zanu PF indaba brings together the nations top leaders and thousands of provincial leaders to discuss and endorse decisions. This time around, expectations are high that a faction behind President Emmerson Mnangagwas term extension will use the event to rubber-stamp the position.\n\nMnangagwa, now aged 83, is Zanu PFs First Secretary giving him the mandate to lead all meetings during the National Peoples Conference at Mutare Polytechnic College this week.\n\nThis weeks Zanu PF itinerary at the annual showcase begins with a Politburo meeting tomorrow, Tuesday, followed by a Central Committee sitting on Wednesday, with both being held in Harare.\n\nOther highlights during the conference will include commissioning of the Mega Market Milling Plant by Mnangagwa as well as opening of the Ministry of Health and Child Care-constructed National Pharmaceutical Warehouse situated at Victoria Chitepo Provincial Hospital.\n\nThe octogenarian leader will also launch the national tree-planting initiative by leading the exercise at the site where the new Zanu PF Provincial offices will be built, adjacent to the conference venue.\n\n",

The situation has now reached a defining moment tasvika kumagumo (we have reached the end), Geza said.\n\nEmmerson has chosen to betray the people of Zimbabwe, aligning himself with his criminal cartels, the Zviganandas. He has opted for corruption, looting and open normalisation of thievery within our very government.\n\nEmmerson has chosen to brutally mutilate our Constitution, massacring the rights of Zimbabweans to the dignity of life through his corrupt machinations. He is the Godfather of corrupt elements, the outspoken ex-guerrilla fighter said.\n\nWe want an uprising from Plumtree to Mutare, from Zambezi to Limpopo. Everyone must flood the streets  Mnangagwa must go, Geza said in the video.\n\nThe call comes as Zimbabwe faces growing political uncertainty, with reports of internal divisions in the ruling Zanu PF party and rising frustration over economic hardships.\n\nGeza noted that the time was ripe for masses to act decisively and end Mnangagwas tyranny and plunder of national coffers put at a staggering US$7 billion.\n\nThe time for our suffering has ended. Today marks the final steps to dismantle this madness. We will nolonger standby and let Emmerson and his Zviganandas rob our people of the future and sacred right to vote in 2028. We will nolonger tolerate the resolution seeking to postpone elections, somehow said to represent the will of the people. This is the gravest insult to the dignity of Zimbabweans.\n\nGeza urged Zimbabweans from all walks of life to participate in streets demonstrations set for next Friday coinciding with the climax of the Zanu PF Annual National Peoples Conference set for Mutare Polytechnic, from 13 to 18, 2025.\n\nOn Friday, 17 October, fellow Zimbabweans, lets say no to State capture by (Kuda) Tagwirei, (Wicknell) Chivayo and their fellow Zviganandas.\n\nLets say no to the looting of our State resources, when civil servants are poorly paid, lets say no to the looting of billions when our people die in hospitals without medication, when our women give birth in open spaces.\n\nThis country doesnt belong to Emmerson, his wife and criminal cartels, declared Geza, who is largely viewed to be bidding for Vice President Constantino Chiwenga to take over the presidency come 2028.\n\nThe struggle must continue until every Zimbabwean is free from tyranny, Geza said.\n\n",
