Gunundu emphasised that the tournament is not just a game, but a platform to support the next generation of agribusiness leaders.\n\nProceeds will benefit two key initiatives: the ZAS Master Farmer Training Programme, designed to equip farmers with critical skills and boost their confidence, and the ZAS Scholarship Programme, which offers financial assistance to students pursuing diplomas in agriculture, horticulture, and animal science, he said.\n\nIn addition to the tournament, attendees will be treated to a thrilling performance by the international Backsplit Performance Bikers, known for their high-energy, precision biking displays.\n\nGunundu described the event as a unique mix of sport and agricultural advocacy, promising an unforgettable experience while highlighting the bright future of Zimbabwes agricultural community.\n\n",

Until and unless section 8 of the Immigration Act is declared unconstitutional and such declaration is confirmed by the Constitutional Court, the courts hands are tied.\n\nThe provision gives immigration authorities up to 14 days to verify an individuals identity, nationality and antecedents.\n\nThe Chief Immigration Officer opposed Mupenzis release, stating that his nationality was still under investigation and that none of the documents he presented substantiated his claim to refugee status.\n\nApplicants identity and nationality status have been questioned by the countrys security apparatus, the court was told.\n\nThe judge acknowledged Mupenzis complaint over not being given reasons for his detention, but made it clear that release was not the remedy. Whilst applicant might have a genuine grievance that he was not furnished with reasons for the arrest and detention forthwith, I am not persuaded that the remedy for that is his immediate release, she said.\n\nThere was no order regarding costs.\n\n",
