            "content": "The Premier League is the richest and most competitive football league in the world. But the local administration has decided to undergo its biggest transformation in decades. They consider implementing a form of salary cap, known as anchoring. It wont allow clubs to pay new players more than several times the revenue of the lowest-earning club in the league. This financial transformation can potentially reshape the Premier League and the world of football overall. But this is not the only change to be expected in modern football. The busy schedule also required an immediate solution. Read on to learn more about upcoming changes.\n\nAnchoring the Premier League\n\nThe new salary cap will link how much a club can spend on wages to the earnings of the leagues lowest-earning club. The idea is to create financial parity, preventing a few elite clubs from outspending everyone else by huge margins. This transformation promises to have a huge impact on the national league, so every reliableinternet betting serviceis currently assessing potential changes to the betting markets and odds.\n\nThe Premier League has always been a huge financial power in professional sports. Manchester City, Liverpool, and Chelsea are the top clubs, attracting the best players with massive contracts. Yet critics argue that this growing wealth gap has ruined competition, making it hardly possible for smaller clubs to reach the top. Should the anchoring proposal pass or not? It will definitely tie top clubs hands when negotiating salaries. The so-called Big Six clubs have expressed concerns that the new system would limit their ability to attract elite players, potentially damaging the reputation of the national league in the world.\n\nThe financial reform is the main topic for discussion in the Premier League. Meanwhile, other countries are discussing player overload, which is slowly becoming a serious issue. The football calendar has been expanded, with domestic, continental, and international competitions. The Club World Cup now requires teams to play up to seven matches to reach the final. Meanwhile, the Champions League format has expanded to include additional matches on the group stage. The World Cup continues welcoming new teams, increasing the total number of matchups.\n\nThe busy schedule means exciting matches for fans. But it also means more injuries among players. Not everyone can handle the pressure. Cole Palmer from Chelsea played 55 games last season. At the beginning of the new season, the 23-year-old player has already reported a groin injury that would keep him on the bench for weeks. Ousmane Dembl is also struggling with a few muscle injuries this season.\n\nAt the European Football Clubs (EFC) General Assembly, club representatives discussed possible solutions to the existing problem. They considered increasing the substitute allowance from five to six. They also discussed the idea of expanding the team registration limit from 25 to 28 players. The team will be able to rotate players more frequently, which will reduce fatigue and the risk of injury. Not everyone agrees that this could be the right solution to the problem. The Professional Footballers Association (PFA) in the UK has expressed skepticism, arguing that larger teams might not actually reduce mental fatigue. All players must attend training, travel to play matches, and remain mentally engaged throughout the season. If someone ends up without playtime, they still have to be physically and mentally prepared.\n\nOnce thing is clear: if the situation doesnt change, some players may take radical action. In Manchester United, they have already expressed its dissatisfaction with the current situation. They have even explained their failure to qualify for the main European championships with the massive fatigue among players. Will they go on strike? Or will they find other ways of solving the problem? We will know soon!\n\nThe new salary cap and the attempt to survive a busy schedule are two critical issues. The Premier League must decide whether to stay with the current system or move toward fairness and transparency. The anchoring system, if approved, would redefine financial norms in the worlds most expensive league. Increasing substitute allowance and registration limit could also be the first step toward a more reasonable football calendar. After all, player health is more important than commercial gains.\n\nYet, both measures involve a certain risk. Restricted expenses can make football less attractive to global players. Minor adjustments to squad rules may not be enough to protect players from burnout. So far, one thing is clear: change is coming. The decisions made in the coming months will shape the future of football for decades. The Premier League, once the gold standard of wealth and competition, could soon be the testing ground for a new era in world football.\n\n",

            "content": "ByElmond Bandauko, The Conversation\n\nThe informal sector hasbecome a dominant source of livelihoodsfor urban residents in African cities. Within this sector, street trading is one of the most visible and vital components of urban economies.\n\nIn Zimbabwes capital city, too, street traders, selling clothing, snacks, fruits and vegetables, household goods, electronics and many other products, are a dominant feature in the economy. As in most African cities, the majority of Harares traders operate without licences, and they are often victims of municipal raids and displacements. Yet, despite this hostile environment, street trading continues to flourish.\n\nHow do traders organise themselves in such a difficult setting? Who decides who sells where? And how is order maintained in a space where the states control is weak or repressive?\n\nI am an urbangeographerwhose work focuses onurban informalityand governance in African cities. These questions are at the heart of astudythat was part of my doctoral research onurban governance and the spatial politics of street traders in Harare. I am especially interested in how the urban poor wield their individual and collective agency to challenge urban exclusion.\n\nDrawing on interviews and focus groups with traders in Harares central business district, the research explores the invisible systems of informal governance that regulate access to trading spaces. The study shows that street trading is structured by its own internal rules, norms and power relations.\n\nInformality is not the absence of order. It is a different kind of order, rooted in everyday negotiation, social trust, and the shared struggle to survive in an unequal city.\n\nI concluded that city authorities and others should recognise that these informal governance systems are legitimate, and can even be useful when it comes to formalising activities in the city. Ignoring them could lead to conflict and deeper inequalities.\n\nZimbabwes economy as a whole has been unstable over the past four decades. As a result, the informal economy has become very important. The relationship between urban authorities and street traders has always beenantagonistic, however. That conflict has been the focus of most of the research on street trading. Harares city officials, like those in many other African cities, often treat traders as illegal, criminal, or a threat tomodern urban order.\n\nMy research takes a different view: I shift attention away from state repression to the everyday systems of organisation and control that traders themselves have developed.\n\nI conducted 19 semi-structured interviews and three focus groups with traders, to learn about their individual strategies and shared social mechanisms for keeping order on the streets.\n\nTraders in Harare use informal governance mechanisms  unwritten rules, social norms and personal relationships  to decide who can occupy which space, for how long, and under what conditions. These community-based systems are built on mutual recognition and trust, but also shaped by hierarchy, gender and seniority.\n\nThe interviews reveal that the most important rule for maintaining order is consistency. Traders often stay in the same spot for years  sometimes decades  to build customer loyalty and to assert their informal claim.\n\nAs one vendor explained:\n\nI stay in the same spot so that people always know where to find me  When everyone sticks to their usual place, it reduces disputes.\n\nThis practice, described by another scholar, Asef Bayat, as quiet encroachment, involves small, everyday acts of claiming space without formal permission. Over time, these acts become socially recognised by other traders and even by local residents or shopkeepers. If a new vendor tries to take over someones space, existing traders usually intervene before conflict escalates.\n\nAs one woman put it:\n\nNo one can just occupy the space without our permission.\n\nThis peer-enforced control system maintains order but also reinforces informal hierarchies.\n\nAlthough there are no official leaders, senior traders  those with long experience or strong social influence  often act as custodians of space. They mediate disputes, mentor newcomers and enforce unspoken rules.\n\nNew entrants typically undergo an informal street apprenticeship, during which they learn how to operate, when to display goods, how to evade municipal police, and whom to approach for protection. Newcomers cannot simply choose a spot and start selling. They must seek the approval of those already established. This process reflects an internalised authority system rooted in social norms rather than written law.\n\nThe study also uncovers how social capital  networks of trust, kinship and friendship  plays a central role in accessing space.\n\nMany traders gain their first selling spot through relatives or friends who are already part of the informal economy. In this way, street trading becomes an intergenerational practice, often inherited from parents or grandparents.\n\nOne participant explained that her grandmother had traded in the same area for decades, and when she lost her formal job, she joined the family business. Others said they felt morally obliged to reserve a deceased vendors spot for their children or relatives.\n\nHowever, these systems are not equal or fair. Power among traders is unevenly distributed. Long-term vendors and those with strong social connections often dominate lucrative areas, while newcomers (especially young people, women and persons with disabilities) struggle to gain a foothold.\n\nFor example, male traders often control spots near busy transport hubs, which are more profitable but also riskier. Women, who are concerned about safety or need to balance caregiving duties, tend to occupy less visible areas. One visually impaired trader said he relied on others to protect his spot, showing how trust and vulnerability shape spatial access.\n\nThere are also reports of traders using aggressive tactics to defend their territory. Some long-time vendors admitted to chasing away new sellers or even tipping off municipal officers to get competitors arrested. These practices reveal how informal governance can both protect livelihoods and reproduce exclusion.\n\nMy study shows that power in Harares informal economy is not only top-down, from the state to the traders, but also horizontal, negotiated among the traders themselves.\n\nThose with seniority or strong networks act as gatekeepers, deciding who can sell where. Women traders often face verbal or physical harassment from male counterparts but also develop their own strategies of resistance: confronting aggressors, forming alliances, or using moral arguments about fairness to defend their right to trade. These acts of quiet defiance demonstrate that informal governance is a site of both control and agency.\n\nWhat emerges from this research is a more nuanced picture of Harares informal economy. Street traders are not simply victims of a repressive state or chaotic actors in an unregulated market. They are also self-organising agents who build complex systems of order, reciprocity and social regulation in the absence of formal protection.\n\nAt the same time, these systems are not utopian. They involve competition, hierarchy and exclusion. Informal governance is both a survival mechanism and a structure of power.\n\nUnderstanding this duality is crucial for policymakers who wish to design fairer urban policies.\n\nAssistant Professor of Human Geography, University of Alberta\n\nThis article was originally published byThe Conversation.\n\n",

They threatened and ordered him to leave Zimbabwe, having been falsely branded an enemy of the State.\n\nThe letter adds: This designation was based on the unsubstantiated claim that he is an operative of Rwandas National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS), allegedly deployed to target Rwandan refugees who settled in Zimbabwe post 1994.\n\nNsengimana insists he is a legitimate refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo, lawfully residing in Zimbabwe since 2014, and has no links to Rwandan intelligence.\n\nHe alleges that he told the alleged CIO agents that certain Rwandan refugees who settled in Zimbabwe just after the 1994 Rwandan genocide were the ones who were just seeing shadows and were on a frolic of their own, giving the security agents in Zimbabwe false information for purposes of weeding out of Zimbabwe other refugees like Desire Nsengimana who they regarded as threats in business circles, the letter states.\n\nHis lawyers further argue that there was nothing to the allegations as it was a simple case of jealousy and rivalry wherein his detractors sought and still seek to equate his business acumen with state sponsorship.\n\nFollowing the alleged abduction, Nsengimana was reportedly handed over to Immigration Compliance Officer Machona, who ordered him to report to the Immigration Department the following day.\n\nSubsequent to his kidnapping, he was then handed over to one Immigration Compliance Officer Machona who then instructed him to visit the Immigration Department Offices the next day, the 11th of June 2025. He was then advised by Machona that he was going to be detained at Harare Remand Prison as a prohibited person for deportation to Rwanda, the lawyers said.\n\nThe letter further claims that Machona advised him that his arrest and subsequent detention was not up to the Immigration Department, but some powerful members of the Central Intelligence Organisation connected to a clique of refugees from Rwanda. Mr. Nsengimana was perplexed by such abuse of State apparatus in the name of State Security, yet he is not even a danger to the Republic of Zimbabwe.\n\nNsengimana is now appealing to the ZICC to investigate the alleged abuse of authority by State and immigration officials, which he believes is being driven by jealousy and commercial rivalry among refugee business operators in Harare.\n\n",
