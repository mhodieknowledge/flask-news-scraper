            "content": "AFP\n\nIn a field of paprika plants in the heart of Zimbabwe, fourth-generation farmer Daniel Burger and relative newcomer Miriam Mupambawashe discuss the quality of the crop.\n\nBurger, 36, and Mupambawashe, 59, are neighbours and partners in efforts to revive the countrys once-flourishing agriculture sector cut down by a ruinous land reform drive in the 2000s.\n\nThe reform distributed land from the white minority, which still owned most of the best farmland 20 years after independence in 1980, to the black majority.\n\nAround 4,000 white-owned farms were confiscated, some with deadly violence.\n\nMupambawashe was among thousands who received land. Though she initially knew little about farming, her small subsistence plot now thrives.\n\nOther farms failed or were abandoned, with some new tenants unschooled in agriculture and others  including politicians who were handed land  uninterested.\n\nThere were food shortages and Zimbabwe soon required international aid.\n\nThere was a bit of a tough period through the 2000s and, unfortunately, I think it sort of refuelled racial tensions to an extent, Burger told AFP.\n\nBut being so passionate about farming was the motivator for me to move forward, he said.\n\nMupambawashe moved to the area from the southern city of Bulawayo, around 200 kilometres (125 miles) away.\n\nWhen we first came here in 2001, it was a forest and there was nothing built, she said.Some of the white farmers were angry but we managed to talk to each other in good faith and move forward.\n\nThey never let us down and said, You grabbed the farm, lets see if you can do it. But instead they brought their own tractors and equipment to come and help, which we felt was a nice gesture.\n\nIt was hard in the beginning, especially after irrigation equipment was stolen, and the early failures were embarrassing, Mupambawashe said.\n\nBut today her plot does so well that she only needs to buy in sugar and cooking oil.\n\nBurger leases land from her and lends tractors and expertise.\n\nHis familys land was among the few hundreds that were not seized in the 2000s.\n\nNonetheless, For a long time we became wound up in compensation, said Burger, vice-president of the Commercial Farmers Union of Zimbabwe (CFU) that represents mostly white farmers.\n\nBut it wasnt our purpose. Our purpose was driving agriculture and current agricultural affairs forward, he said.\n\nThis year, some farm owners whose land was confiscated received the first compensation payments after decades of waiting.\n\nThe process has been complex and divisive.\n\nThe government committed to compensation as part of an effort to settle arrears and reform the economy in order to be able to regain access to international credit lines cut two decades ago.\n\nIt announced in 2020 the creation of a fund that would pay out US$3.5 billion for infrastructure on farms but not the land, which it says was taken by force by colonial settlers.\n\nUnable to raise cash, the government in 2023 changed the offer to one percent in cash and the remainder in US dollar denominated treasury bonds.\n\nIn April, the first payments were made to 378 of 780 farmers approved for this scheme.\n\nDeon Theron, who represents the Compensation Steering Committee group of former white farmers, says the introduction of the bonds has annulled the original deal and negotiations need to start over.\n\nThe bonds are unsecured and there is limited recourse in the event of non-performance by government, he told AFP.\n\nThe general feeling amongst the farmers is firstly frustration that after 20-odd years we still have not received anything, Theron said.\n\nBut the Property and Farm Compensation Associationsaid its members would take what is on offer.\n\nThe bonds are under international guarantee, said leader Harry Orphanides, adding that digging in and seeking more from the government would be futile.\n\n",

But I think following that intervention, there is now a very marked improvement.\n\nAccording to Guvamatanga, some MDA officers were involved in the scandals involving the loss of millions of dollars by the government.\n\nAnd we did emphasise that there will be an action taken against the accounting officers in the event that they continue with this practice following the intervention of closure, added Guvamatanga.\n\nCommittee chairperson Charlton Hwende requested to have the list of those companies that defaulted on delivery.\n\nWe will provide the list. It is available, said Guvamatanga.\n\nRegarding defaulters, Guvamatanga said, Its the same companies, they change directors, they go and change directors, they get another contract, you know, and its the same players.\n\nSo when we present it for the identity of the companies, we then see the same players all over. We are now calling them, bringing them to where you must bring your bank statements. \n\nThose same people become the directors of the new company. They are then given another tender, which they flout. Three, two years later, they change the name of the company, but they remain with the same directors, Guvamatanga said.\n\n",

            "content": "It has been a disappointing period for fans of Mexican soccer, as the premier soccer gaming option hasnt had the licensing rights for the Liga MX since FIFA 22.\n\nThe leagues absence has been a big miss for gamers, especially those that wish to play as some of the major teams from the region such as Club America and Tigres.\n\nHowever, there could yet be good news on the horizon for Liga MX fans as the competition is set toreturn to the EA Sportsfranchise in time to be included in the upcoming release later this year.\n\nPrevious Partnership Ends\n\nThe reason for Liga MXs exclusion from recent EA releases is due to the competitions ongoing partnership with Konami, meaning that it was only able tofeature in theeFootballseries.\n\nThat has been a major blow for fans of the competition, especially considering that the quality of the Konami titles has diminished compared to the offerings provided by EA Sports throughout modern history.\n\nHowever, it was revealed on the site of the eFootball series that Liga MX is no longer listed as an official partner for the title, which signals the end of their three-year agreement.\n\nWhile it has not yet been officially announced that the competition will return to the EA series, there is an expectancy that one of the worlds most popular leagues will once again feature in the worlds most popular soccer gaming title.\n\nWhy is Liga MX So Important?\n\nThe absence of Liga MX clubs in the EA Sports game would have been felt by the developer, especially considering the popularity of the competition across the Americas. The Mexican league is very popular in Americas, as you can see in mostLiga MX betting apps.\n\nWith no Liga MX clubs licensed, sales of the game in Mexico have diminished, with many fans opting to instead play as their favorite clubs in the eFootball series. Gaining licensing rights for the competition is vitally important for the long-term success of the EA Sports game, as the tournament is one of the most followed across the Americas.\n\nThat is reflected by the fact that Liga MX is second to only the Premier League in terms of average viewing figures in the United States. Not only that, but the atmospheric stadiums available to players in Mexico offer players a unique environment to play matches.\n\nThere are also important factors that should be considered when it comes to the stadium licenses, as EA FC will have the rights to include all major arenas that will be used for next summers World Cup. However, the title of the competition will need to be different due to the ending of the agreement between EA Sports and FIFA.\n\nWhen Was Liga MX Last in an EA Sports Game?\n\nIt has been a long wait for Liga MX fans, as the competition hasnt been included an EA Sports series since FIFA 2022. The absence was felt by fans in the proceeding years, as it greatly reduced the number of teams available to players.\n\nHowever, its return is likely to appease the vast majority of gamers that like to experience and play with new teams that they wouldnt typically come across. It is also a further reminder that EA Sports are committed to offering the most authentic and comprehensive soccer gaming experience to their customers.\n\nOther Teams That Will Miss Out on EA FC 26\n\nThere will be a host of teams that will miss out on being included in the upcoming release of EA FC 26. Among those include teams that have been relegated from the bottom available tiers in the title. That includes English clubs such as Carlisle United and Morecambe.\n\nHowever, Barnet will replace one of the teams following their promotion from the National League. Two of the biggest teams in world soccer will also be likely to be missing in the title this year. EA has been missing Italian teams in recent editions of the title, and once again, it appears unlikely that either Inter Milan or AC Milan will be licensed in time to feature in the 2026 title.\n\nWith the World Cup fast approaching, there will also be major concerns that some of the biggest national teams in the world are also not licensed. The most notable of those is Brazil, who havent been licensed in the EA Sports series since FIFA 23.\n\nBelgium was unlicensed in EA FC 25, but featured in the previous edition of the title. Other nations that could make the World Cup but are unlikely to be licensed in time for the release this year include Australia, Canada, China, and Turkey. The latter of the nations hasnt featured in an EA Sports series title since FIFA 2021.\n\nWhen is EA FC 26 Released?\n\nSoccer fans still face a lengthy wait before the upcoming title in the EA Sports series is released, as EA FC 26 isnt set to hit shelves until late September.\n\n",
