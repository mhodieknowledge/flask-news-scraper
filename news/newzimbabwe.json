            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has urged members of the public to report any suspected bogus traffic roadblocks, warning that rogue officers found conducting such operations will face disciplinary action.\n\nThis follows growing public concern over the increasing number of police roadblocks, particularly in cities such as Harare, where some motorists have complained about encountering several checkpoints within short distances in some cases less than 10 kilometres apart.\n\nIn a statement issued on Thursday, national police spokesperson, Commissioner Paul Nyathi called on the public to alert authorities if they come across suspicious roadblocks.\n\nIn this regard, members of the public are encouraged to engage the Commissioner General of Police or the respective Provincial Command if there are concerns about unusual roadblock deployments in certain areas. Disciplinary action will be taken against any police officer who conducts roadblock duties in a manner which is not in conformity with police set standards, said Nyathi.\n\nHe emphasised that official police roadblocks are not conducted randomly, explaining that, under traffic regulations, they are typically located within a 30 to 50-kilometre radius and are subject to close supervision to prevent misconduct and corruption.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police Command reiterates that all police roadblock schedules are submitted by Station, District and Provincial Police Commanders to the Police General Headquarters Operations Department for guidance and clearance.\n\nThe policy of the Zimbabwe Republic Police is that no roadblocks are manned within a 30 to 50 kilometre radius of each policing area, whether in urban or rural set up. The police officers conducting roadblock duties are supervised by Station, District and Provincial Commanders to prevent cases of indiscipline or corruption and ensure quality service to the public, he said.\n\nCommissioner Nyathi further explained that exceptions to these guidelines may occur when the police respond to national events or urgent security situations.\n\nHowever, the public should take note that police roadblocks are heightened or increased during public order situations, national events, or special operations such as reacting to an immediate incident or scene involving moving criminals or stolen property. Soon after, the situation has to revert back to the ideal scenario.\n\nThe ZRP has faced growing criticism in recent years over reports of police officers accepting bribes from motorists, particularly commuter operators in major cities such as Harare and Bulawayo. Several officers have been caught on camera allegedly taking money from public transport drivers and other motorists, further fuelling public mistrust.\n\n",

In the event of failure, Council will remove the car shells at a cost to lessees or owners of the cars, said Moyo.\n\nMoyo said failure to comply would result in the removal of the vehicles at the owners expense.\n\nIn the event of failure, Council will remove the car shells at a cost to lessees or owners of the cars.\n\nThe CoH will take the vehicles and shells to a junkyard or site for disused vehicles where they will be stored awaiting disposal or auctioning, said Moyo.\n\nThe city urged residents to report any abandoned or derelict vehicles to help authorities enforce the cleanup.\n\nWe urge residents to come forward with information on abandoned and broken-down vehicles dumped at overnight cars parks, streets and open spaces so that the CoH takes action, said Moyo.\n\n",

Instrument (SI) 87 of 2025, which was gazetted by Industry and Commerce Minister Mangaliso Ndhlovu last month.The SI imposed a statutory payment into the Agriculture Revolving Fund on all millers, a move that they warned could result in negative inflationary pressures.Recommendations to set it aside were ignored.Failure to do so, as a result, is set to hike bread prices by not less than 4% on the retailers side according to the National Bakers Association of Zimbabwe (NBAZ) and Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ).Maize meal, stock feed, and other related products are likely to see prices go up.The NBAZ wishes to reiterate that the sector does not have capacity to take any increases in input costs, without compromising business viability, reads a letter to Ndhlovu from NBAZ, dated October 24, 2025.Bread flour accounts for approximately 43% of the total bread production cost, if a 4% increase in bread flour is permitted, it will translate to a 2 cents increase per cost of producing a loaf, resulting in an increase in the wholesale price of bread effective on the day on which the flour price is increased.The communicated increase in flour price, compounded with the other input cost escalations will result in an overall 5 cents per loaf pass-through effect to the retailer, most likely taking the retail price of bread, above the US$1 psychological benchmark, effective 1 November 2025.Despite fuel price increases, shortages of electricity and haphazard distribution, bread prices have remained at generally a dollar across the country.Their price hike could have a ripple effect whose inflationary impact might bring back memories of the late 2000s when prices changed by the hour.GMAZ, which according to another letter in NewZimbabwe.coms possession conceded defeat upon failure to scrap the SI, has already communicated the increase to the government.Regrettably, we have failed to successfully lobby for this SI to be reversed and have no option but to comply with it, reads a letter sent to Ndhlovu dated 23 October and copied to Lands and Agriculture Minister Anxious Masuka, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube, the presidents office, and the

This will allow families to find closure as they now have the opportunity to bury their loved ones.\n\nSouth Africas Department of Transport has previously confirmed that the crash was caused by a combination of speeding, mechanical failure, and overloading.\n\nA preliminary report into the crash revealed that the bus was overloaded by 23 passengers, half of its brakes were defective, and the driver was travelling at an unsafe speed along a steep, winding mountain pass.\n\nTransport Minister Barbara Creecy and her deputy, Mkhuleko Hlengwa, have officially received the report, which was compiled by the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC).\n\nAccording to the RTMC, a major contributing factor was the drivers excessive speed for the conditions along the mountain descent.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nBUSINESS couple Clark Clever Makoni and Beverly Aisha Ndonda Makoni, accused of defrauding former Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor Gideon Gono, have approached the High Court seeking to overturn a ruling by Regional Magistrate Stanford Mambanje, which dismissed their application for discharge.\n\nIn their court papers, the couple accuses the magistrate of grossly misdirecting himself and creating new charges by placing them on their defence despite what they say is a State case barren of evidence.They cite Mambanje and Prosecutor General Loice Matanda-Moyo as first and second respondents respectively.The first respondent grossly misdirected himself by ignoring that neither the main nor the alternative charge disclosed a valid offence, the application reads.The courts reasoning was so outrageous in its defiance of logic that no sensible court applying its mind could have arrived at it.The Makonis, represented by Admire Rubaya of Rubaya and Chatambudza Legal Practitioners, argue that their prosecution is a failed fishing expedition.The State is acting like a soccer player who has dived at the centre circle of a soccer pitch and clamouring to the referee to be awarded a penalty. This is clearly unacceptable and untenable, the application states.The couple is jointly charged with fraud and corruptly using a false document after allegedly altering company directorship details of Valley Lodge (Pvt) Ltd in 2017. The State alleges they removed Ayoob Omar and Mohammed Hussein Omar as directors and replaced them with their own names to take control of the lodges accounts.But the applicants say the State failed to prove any misrepresentation, intent, or prejudice.There is no way the accused persons can be placed onto the defence in circumstances where the essential elements of the offence of fraud have not been set out, they said.As it stands, the charge of fraud is barren as it lacks the essential averments required to make it a valid one.They also accused the magistrate of overstepping his judicial role.This Honourable Court has no discretion to usurp the States responsibilities as the dominus litis and proceed to recreate new particulars and averments for the alleged charge of fraud, the couple argued.It must avoid the temptation of making a bidding for the State. It laid its bed, it must lie on it.The couple further claims the States witnesses exonerated them by confirming that Valley Lodges directorship had not changed since 2009, contradicting the fraud allegations.There was a clear concession by all the critical witnesses that the directors of Valley Lodge (Pvt) Ltd have remained the same as from 2009 till today, they submitted. This concession clearly exonerated the accused persons.They also argue the State failed to prove that they withdrew any funds from the lodges bank account, allegedly amounting to US$70,000.The State never led any evidence showing that there was any withdrawal from the account in question, the defence stated. There were no withdrawal slips nor any documentary evidence to that effect.Makoni and Ndonda further challenge the authenticity of the alleged fraudulent CR14 form, saying it was never proven to have been authored or signed by them.None of the witnesses said they saw any of the accused creating or signing the alleged CR14 in issue. The State failed to prove as a matter of fact that the accused authored the document, they said.They dismissed the case as baseless.A criminal trial is not a fishing expedition. The accused persons should not be put to their defence hoping that along the way they will convict themselves out of their own mouths. This is a classical failed fishing expedition where the State has failed to even catch a small frog or a kapenta.The couple wants the High Court to review and set aside Mambanjes ruling and substitute it with a verdict of not guilty, arguing that the magistrates decision was rendered without jurisdiction and cannot stand.The matter is yet to be heard.\n\nIn their court papers, the couple accuses the magistrate of grossly misdirecting himself and creating new charges by placing them on their defence despite what they say is a State case barren of evidence.\n\nThey cite Mambanje and Prosecutor General Loice Matanda-Moyo as first and second respondents respectively.The first respondent grossly misdirected himself by ignoring that neither the main nor the alternative charge disclosed a valid offence, the application reads.The courts reasoning was so outrageous in its defiance of logic that no sensible court applying its mind could have arrived at it.The Makonis, represented by Admire Rubaya of Rubaya and Chatambudza Legal Practitioners, argue that their prosecution is a failed fishing expedition.The State is acting like a soccer player who has dived at the centre circle of a soccer pitch and clamouring to the referee to be awarded a penalty.

This is a classical failed fishing expedition where the State has failed to even catch a small frog or a kapenta.The couple wants the High Court to review and set aside Mambanjes ruling and substitute it with a verdict of not guilty, arguing that the magistrates decision was rendered without jurisdiction and cannot stand.The matter is yet to be heard.\n\nBut the applicants say the State failed to prove any misrepresentation, intent, or prejudice.\n\nThere is no way the accused persons can be placed onto the defence in circumstances where the essential elements of the offence of fraud have not been set out, they said.As it stands, the charge of fraud is barren as it lacks the essential averments required to make it a valid one.They also accused the magistrate of overstepping his judicial role.This Honourable Court has no discretion to usurp the States responsibilities as the dominus litis and proceed to recreate new particulars and averments for the alleged charge of fraud, the couple argued.It must avoid the temptation of making a bidding for the State. It laid its bed, it must lie on it.The couple further claims the States witnesses exonerated them by confirming that Valley Lodges directorship had not changed since 2009, contradicting the fraud allegations.There was a clear concession by all the critical witnesses that the directors of Valley Lodge (Pvt) Ltd have remained the same as from 2009 till today, they submitted. This concession clearly exonerated the accused persons.They also argue the State failed to prove that they withdrew any funds from the lodges bank account, allegedly amounting to US$70,000.The State never led any evidence showing that there was any withdrawal from the account in question, the defence stated. There were no withdrawal slips nor any documentary evidence to that effect.Makoni and Ndonda further challenge the authenticity of the alleged fraudulent CR14 form, saying it was never proven to have been authored or signed by them.None of the witnesses said they saw any of the accused creating or signing the alleged CR14 in issue.
