            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe case in which businessmen Moses Mpofu and Mike Chimombe are accused of defrauding the government of US$7 million in a botched presidential goats scheme Monday took a new twist after former Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture John Basera acknowledged that they only partly failed to meet the contractual agreement.\n\nBasera was being cross-examined by Mpofus lawyer, Advocate Tapson Dzvetero, when he confirmed that the duos company, Blackdeck, had managed to meet their first-year target of a five five-year deal.\n\nBasera told High Court judge Justice Pisirayi Kwenda that Blackdeck supplied 3,595 goats against 3,113, which was written in their agreement.\n\nThe former permanent secretary also confirmed that the company had unforeseen challenges in mobilising the goats locally.\n\nWe had green, red and buffer zones because of Foot and Mouth Disease. If I remember well, we had made a recommendation of not transporting goats from one province to another province, but to do intra-province distributions because of Foot and Mouth Disease, he said.\n\nBasera confirmed that when the Agriculture Ministry asked Blackdeck to supply 500 goats for a launch project in Chipinge, the company delivered.\n\nDzvetero also asked him to confirm that there were also other incidents where the company wrote to the company to supply the goats for other launches, and he said this was correct.\n\nThe court heard that the ministry was supposed to call the guarantor or go for arbitration in cases of conflicts as outlined in the agreement but the ministry did not do so.\n\nBasera said wthat when he left the ministry, plans were being made to call the guarantor.\n\nThe court also heard that the ministry instead went on to request the supply of more goats under the presidential goat pass on scheme despite the conflict which arose.\n\nThe state alleges Blackdeck submitted fraudulent documents to win the US$87 million deal.\n\nIt is alleged that the two were given an advance payment of US$7 million, which they failed to account for, and they both deny the charges.\n\nTrial continues Tuesday.\n\n",

Such conditions are known to severely affect canine behaviour and are especially dangerous when present in certain breeds, particularly those already classified as high risk or dangerous, the SPCA said.\n\nThe SPCA further warned the public against crossbreeding dangerous dog breeds, explaining that such animals require specialised handling skills that many owners may lack, potentially leading to tragic outcomes.\n\nWe strongly caution the public against the ownership, breeding, and cross-breeding of dangerous dog breeds. These animals require specialised handling, socialization and containment responsibilities that, if neglected, can result in tragic consequences such as these, the SPCA added.\n\nThe organisation urgedthe public to approach its offices for assistance with appropriate animal care, advice, or if they wish to surrender their animals.\n\n",

I survived because I could swim, he told the BBC.\n\nAnother resident, Saliu Sulaiman, said the floods had left him homeless and destroyed some of his cash business profits.\n\nI lost at least $1,500 to the floods. It was the proceeds from the sale of my farm produce the previous day. I contemplated going back into the room to get it, but the pressure of the water scared me.\n\nSome local residents have said that the flooding was so devastating because a nearby dam had burst, however the authorities have not confirmed this.\n\nOn Sunday, the National Emergency Management Agency (Nema) announced it had started the process of providing relief packages to people affected.\n\nThe agencyadded in a post on Facebookthat roads and bridges were also affected by the flood, which has had a knock-on effect on the local economy and traffic.\n\nThe Nigerian Red Cross alsoreleased a statement on Fridaysaying the floods had caused significant loss of life and widespread distress.\n\nFloods are not uncommon during the Nigerian rainy season, which lasts from April until October.\n\nIn 2024, Nigeria experienced flooding from heavy rain which caused deaths and drove people from their homes.\n\nThere was also severe flooding in 2022, when more than 600 people died and 1.3 million were displaced.\n\n",
