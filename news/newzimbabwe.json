They marched him into the yard where they confronted Rusike who is employed at the farm as the internal security guard and they disarmed him of his CBC shotgun, force-marched him to the front guardroom.\n\nThey also confronted Zhakata who is a security guard, they struck him several times on the head with iron bars before they tied both his hands and legs with cable tiers, the State alleges.\n\nThe court heard that two of the security guards were left under the guard of two of the accused persons, armed with a pistol and an iron bar as the rest force-marched the other security guard to the main house.\n\nOn approaching the main entry, the accused allegedly cut the key on the burglar screen with a bolt cutter, forced open the main door and entered the house.\n\nThey allegedly went on to force open the kitchen door and force-marched the guard to Geralds bedroom where they met him in the passage and demanded cash.\n\nFearing for his life, he surrendered cash, US$18,000, a Sarsilmaz pistol loaded with eight rounds and two phones.\n\nThe accused persons then demanded to be shown the safe and on their way, they passed through Vimbais bedroom where they demanded cash and safe keys and she surrendered cash, US$1,100, a Chubb safe key and a Samsung Galaxy A35 without a SIM card.\n\nThey took her to the main bedroom where she opened the safe and surrendered cash US$55,000.\n\nWhilst the accused persons were still in the bedroom, Elphas Maruta, who was armed with a rifle loaded with four rounds, got information of the robbery and advanced towards the house and fired two shots towards the accused persons who also fired back three shots before they fled from the scene with the stolen property, Mutsokoti further told the court.\n\nAccording to the State, the stolen goods and properties amounted to US$74,000.\n\n",

Pride Mkono described Mnangagwas appointments as simple coup-proofing.\n\nGeza, widely believed to be under the protection of Chiwenga, has been in hiding for over three weeks and riling up the masses through social media to rise up and depose Mnangagwa even before he finishes his second term.\n\nThe argument being put forward by Geza is that Mnangagwa has been corrupted by elements he keeps around him. The outspoken former Central Committee member in Zanu PF who has been publishing videos periodically, is campaigning for Chiwenga to take over power.\n\nMondays protest turned into a stay away, after people excused themselves from the fight and chose to watch and follow online. Only about 98 were arrested for participating in a gathering with the intent to promote violence.\n\n",

It raised concerns about the persistent shortage of judges, which contributes to significant delays in the administration of justice, particularly in high-profile cases related to human rights violations and corruption.\n\nThe State Party must take immediate steps to prevent and eradicate all threats, intimidations and other forms of undue influence on the judiciary by the executive branches of government and to ensure in law and in practice the full independence and impartiality of judges, including by adopting procedures for the selection, appointment, promotion, sanction and removal of judges that are transparent and impartial, the report added.\n\nWhile commending the measures taken by the State party to enhance judicial efficiency and reduce case backlogs through the rollout of the Integrated Electronic Case Management System and the decentralisation of the High Court, the Committee noted the barriers to accessing this system due to low smartphone and internet coverage, high data costs and digital literacy gaps, particularly in rural communities.\n\nThe report also challenged the Statepartyto elucidate all cases of enforced disappearances and conduct impartial and thorough investigations without delay, ensuring that the victims and their relatives are informed of the progress and results of the investigation.\n\nIt called for the identification of those responsible and ensuring that they are prosecuted and, if convicted, punished with appropriate penalties that are commensurate with the gravity of their crimes and that victims of enforced disappearance and their families are provided with full reparation.\n\nThe experts said the government should allocate sufficient human and financial resources to the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission to enable it to discharge its mandate effectively and independently, including plans to enhance its field presence in full compliance with the principles relating to the status of national institutions for the promotion and protection of human rights (the Paris Principles).\n\n",

We know all about this corruption.\n\nWhere you are now goinginto politicsdo not undermine me. You are conniving with Mnangagwa to become president  now you want to lead the country through the back door, said Geza.\n\nZANU PF is at loggerheads, with one faction pushing for Mnangagwa to retain the presidency beyond 2030, while another supports Chiwenga to succeed the octogenarian leader.\n\nTagwirei has been accused of benefiting from his close ties to Mnangagwa through lucrative government contracts.\n\nHe secured a multimillion-dollar deal to construct the Mbudzi Interchange flyover and has expanded his business empire into mining while maintaining a near-monopoly in the fuel sector.\n\nAdditionally, Tagwirei has been leading the Command Agriculture programme and currently chairs the Land Tenure Implementation Committee.\n\nGeza accused Tagwirei of seeking to reverse the land reform programme.\n\nWhere have you ever seen a genuine programme being overseen by two banks? This issue of trying to reverse the land reform programmeleave it, added Geza.\n\nEfforts to get a comment from Tagwirei were futile as he had not responded to questions sent to him by the time of publishing.\n\n",

In Zimbabwe, they come ahead of possible uprising given how unpopular the Zanu PF regime has become, said Mkono.\n\nYou will probably see a lot of other deployments in other state security agencies. This is not shocking; Mnangagwa knows that his exit is closer.\n\nIt is a sign that his regime is panicking. This regime consolidation is coming at a time when factionalism has ripped apart the ruling party.\n\nGeza had, in publicly shared addresses, called on state security agents to stand with the people in unseating Mnangagwa, who wants to stay in power beyond his constitutionally mandated two terms.\n\nHe promised better working conditions and improved wages, comparing his promises to the US$50 allowance given to the officers.\n\nDespite his promises, truckloads of button-stick-wielding anti-riot officers could be seen crisscrossing Harare, Masvingo and Bulawayo.\n\n",
