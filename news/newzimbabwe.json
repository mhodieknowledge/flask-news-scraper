            "content": "By Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThis story was originally published byGlobal Press Journal.\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  A year ago, all 16 checkout lanes were packed at OK Zimbabwe supermarket in Harare, one of the major retailers in the country. Customers queued shoulder to shoulder, their carts filled with Zimbabwes pantry essentials. Today, just two tills are open. They serve only a handful of customers who pick from whats available on half-empty shelves.\n\nAcross Zimbabwe, the situation is the same in many retail shops. While some are still holding on, their shelves are increasingly empty, with branches closing one by one. Others have folded operations entirely, unable to compete with informal traders.\n\nIt never used to be like this, says Mercy, who has worked for OK Zimbabwe for over 10 years and asked not to be referred to by her full name for fear of losing her job. People are not coming to buy from us.\n\nZimbabwes formal retail sector struggles to hang on due to a combination of factors that have been gradually escalating. At the heart of the issue is the countrys unstable currency system. In 2024, the government introduced Zimbabwean gold, or ZiG, meant to be a stable successor to the unreliable Zimbabwean dollar. The ZiG, which is tied to gold and foreign reserves, would  the government hoped  curb inflation and restore confidence in a local currency, which has long been in competition with the much-preferred United States dollar.\n\nZimbabwean gold surpassed many peoples expectations,but it was no magic cure for the countrys economic turmoil.In the black market, whose unofficial exchange rates most people use, the currency was in short supply and struggled to hold value. Six months after its introduction, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe slashed the official exchange rate by more than 40%, trying to bring it closer to the black market rate.\n\nMeanwhile, the government also put restrictions on formal retailers. It required them to price their goods within the official exchange rate and criminalized selling above the rate. This led to price hikes.\n\nRetail customers turned to informal markets where they could pay in the US dollars they still preferred, and at the more reasonable black market exchange rate.\n\nOnce busy, many formal retailers across Zimbabwe have folded operations amid economic turmoil, an unstable currency system, and increased competition from the informal sector.Photo credit: Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nInstability is likely to continue, as US dollars become scarce following the pullout of aid from the United States, much of it funnelled through the US Agency for International Development,which has been a key source of foreign currency inflows in Zimbabwe.\n\nMirriam Masikati, who once preferred supermarkets for their quality of goods, says she gets more value at these informal markets. It is worrying that I might buy fake products without knowing, but the prices are pushing us to these informal markets, says the mother of three.\n\nAlthough the government in April repealed the requirement that formal retailers price their goods within the official exchange rate, after nearly one year the damage had already been done. Major retailers like Spar Zimbabwe and N Richards Group folded some branches in parts of the capital. A statement by the Confederation of Zimbabwean Retailers in January indicated that some shops had reduced their space by 60%.\n\nAnd in April, OK Zimbabwe issued a loss warning, laying out a goal to raise US$30 million and explaining the financial challenges it has experienced in the last six months, including difficulty maintaining stock, paying suppliers and meeting other financial obligations.\n\nIn contrast, business is booming for informal traders  who are a significant part of the informal sector that makes up an estimated 65% of Zimbabwes economy and contributed about 72% to the countrys gross domestic product in 2024. They already had a good slice of the market. They now capture a larger share.\n\nThat share could grow further. Informal traders often sell out due to high demand, says Admire Musa, a cashier at one such shop in Harare. The success has attracted other Zimbabweans to open similar shops, he says.\n\nManufacturers, who once supplied formal retailers on credit, also are turning to informal traders, who pay in US cash, according to a 2024 report by the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce.\n\nThis also allows manufacturers to bypass the banking system and avoid taxes, says Brains Muchemwa, an economist. Such high levels of back-channel commerce could be a problem for the country, he says. It significantly reduces the governments tax revenue, as informal traders do not comply with regulations, he adds.\n\nA 2022 report by the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority indicates that less than 0.5% of the money made in the informal sector is collected as tax revenue.\n\nIt is worrying that I might buy fake products without knowing, but the prices are pushing us to these informal markets. Mirriam Masikati\n\nThe government has tried to address the growing levels of informalization. In February, it issued a monetary policy requiring that all businesses use point-of-sale machines. This would bring informal trade into regular banking channels.\n\nBut Muchemwa is skeptical. The informal sector thrives because it can avoid the burdens of regulations, he says. Without stable policies and an encouraging trading environment, the governments efforts will not yield anything, he says.\n\nProsper Chitambara, also an economist, says the country needs tax reforms that make it easier and cheaper for businesses to formalize. He points to Brazil and Uruguay as successful examples where simplified tax regimes and supportive laws have reduced informality.\n\nFor Muchemwa, the solution is simple. As long as we defy the logic in terms of managing the economy, in particular printing money and coming up with policies that are not sensible, it will continue to present challenges for this economy, he says.\n\nThe countrys struggling economy is a chance for retailers to adapt, says Mthandazo Mlotshwa, chief operating officer for Zapalala Supermarkets. Though Zapalala closed some of its branches, Mlotshwa remains optimistic and doesnt see the informal market as a threat. Still, regulation and stable currency rates are needed, he adds, and the government is taking steps in that direction.\n\nMeanwhile, Mercy and other workers in retail remain anxious about their future. Everyone is demotivated, some have lost their jobs, and for us who remain the salaries are not coming on time and sometimes you get a portion of your salary, she says, her voice lowered in frustration.\n\nGamuchirai Masiyiwais a Reporter-in-Residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.\n\nGlobal Press Journal delivers bold, investigative and in-depth explanatory reporting on the worlds most urgent issues.\n\n",

The aim of layering is to create a trail that is difficult to trace back to the original source of funds.\n\nRaymond Singathini Chigogwana\n\nThe Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) said it was investigating the issue.\n\nI can tell you right now we have some documents which we want to show the three gentlemen and I hope I am not prejudicing investigations, but I want Zimbabwe to know that we have not been sitting on this investigation, ZACC chairperson Michael Reza told reporters.\n\nWe have collected certain facts and when that information comes on the form 242 and if everything goes according to plan, we will use this to go to court. You will see detailed information with facts, figures and numbers. You will see those things, mark my words.\n\nZACC also interviewed Mike Chimombe and Moses Mpofu, Chivayos former business partners. Chimombe and Mpofu were later detained over a different case after their fallout with Chivayo.\n\nMost of the money laundering activities on this case happened between Zimbabwe and South Africa, with Johannesburg being the centre of action.\n\nSouth African companies and banks are believed to have been deeply involved in the funds deposits and transfers.\n\nChigogwana, who has assets in Zimbabwe and South Africa, has been in banking for nearly 30 years  he worked for Zimbank (ZB Bank), BancABC, the now-defunct Premier Bank (Ecobank) where he was Managing Director, and currently Access Finance Group as chief executive and majority shareholder.\n\nAccess Finance, a money transfer hub, has operations in Harare and Johannesburg.\n\nThe SAFIC report found that Chigogwana received about R60 million from Chivayos labyrinth of companies through the Johannesburg-based Kumba Group (Pty) Ltd, which got R28,875,000, and via Agile Venture Capital (Pty) Ltd that obtained R31,000,300. Chigogwanas interests in Kumba were represented by former Access Finance senior executive Elton Chitondo before he resigned from the company, according to company documents.\n\nCurrently, Refiloe Etsane, Access Finance chief strategy officer, represents Chigogwanas interests in Kumba as a director.\n\nIn Agile, Chigogwana is a director himself.\n\nWicknell Chivayo\n\nThe report shows Chigogwanas companies were conduits of transferring some of the money for Chivayo for different activities and also changing it from one currency to another.\n\nChigogwanas companies would charge transaction fees and reap the arbitrage dividend from that.\n\nWhen Chivayo received millions in Johannesburg in rands, he would approach companies like Chigogwanas convert it back into United States dollars, the original currency of operation, for use in Zimbabwe and elsewhere.\n\nMuch of the transactions were conducted via Hawala transfer, by which no physical movement of currency takes place.\n\nThe Zimbabwean government paid R1.2 billion to Ren-Form CCC, the South African company which won the elections printing tender in 2023, which in turn transferred a huge part of the funds  R800 million  to Chivayo, their broker in the deal.\n\nRen-Form has confirmed Chivayo is their broker.\n\nRen-Form did not directly address the money trail outlined in the SAFIC report but maintained its relationship with Chivayo was above board.\n\nChivayo reportedly spent some of the funds on luxury goods and properties in South Africa, Zimbabwe, United States, United Kingdom, China, and Dubai, United Arab Emirates.\n\nHe has reportedly spent at least R36.5 million on luxury vehicles with some Zimbabwean media reports claiming that vehicles were later donated to politically connected individuals.\n\nApproached for comment, Chivayo has told media that his agreements with Ren-Form are commercial and confidential, while payments are not legally untenable.\n\nChivayo denied any wrongdoing.\n\nLarge sums of money were paid into Chivayos personal and business bank accounts through his companies, Intratrek Holdings (Pty) Ltd, Edenbreeze (Pty) Ltd, Dolintel Trading Enterprise CC, and WC Trading (Pty) Ltd.\n\nAbout R232 million went through these companies.\n\nEdenbreeze alone received R156 million.\n\nIntratrek Holdings and Dolintel handled most of the R800 million.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nHEALTH and Child Care deputy minister Sleiman Kwidini, Wednesday told Parliament that citizens are very happy with the service delivery in public hospitals, dismissing concerns raised over the collapsing sector as just social media.\n\nKwidini was speaking during a question-and-answer session in the National Assembly.\n\nThis follows Youth Empowerment Minister Tinoda Machakaires plea on social media for President Emmerson Mnangagwa to make time and see firsthand the dire state of public hospitals.\n\nZimbabwes healthcare system has collapsed over the years, suffering a massive brain drain, lack of equipment, poor conditions and demotivated workers among several other issues.\n\nDespite petitions to the government for an urgent redress and protests by healthcare professionals, there has been little to no action, with hospitals now becoming death traps.\n\nZanu PF Chivi South MP Felix Maburutse sought clarification from Kwidini regarding what Machakaire wrote on X (Twitter) about the situation in government health institutions.\n\nSocial media is portraying a negative picture of the status of our healthcare. May the minister update the House on the government policies and programmes that have been done so far and the roadmap in improving healthcare? Maburutse said.\n\nResponding to the MP, Kwidini said, On the part of the social media, indeed, people on social media always talk about what is not happening in the ministry but as the ministry, we are doing wonders since 2018, to make sure the citizens receive quality care.\n\nWhat we are doing is only known by the patients, not the social media participants. As we speak right now, our citizens are very happy with the service delivery that we are giving. As we speak, in the first 100 days said Kwidini before being interrupted by oppositionlegislator Charlton Hwende.\n\nHe must just concentrate on responding to the legitimate issues that people are raising, said Hwende.\n\nThe deputy minister proceeded amid interjections from the opposition bench.\n\nI was on the way to say the complaints were coming from social media. No actual person has come to the Ministry to complain directly to the Minister.\n\nNevertheless, as we speak and as I said, the ministry has improved a lot in terms of service delivery. As we speak, from the first 100 days of the first quarter of 2025, we managed to change some hospital equipment in the sixty-three districts; that is, x-ray machines, theatre beds and so forth.\n\nWe are working on other equipment that will be installed as soon as possible, Kwidini told the August House.\n\nKwidini added that the ministry had tried its best, working hand in hand with the Finance ministry to make sure all medicines and other sundries were availed.\n\nHe also gave the excuse that Zimbabwe does not produce or manufacture most of the drugs and sundries.\n\nWhen we place orders, they are sourced out of the country. They take three to six months to be supplied but I assure this House that in the shortest period of time, we will see improvements.\n\nEverything is now well known that our social media is attacking the Ministry of Health, especially on issues of visitors, not the beneficiaries of the treatment like the patients, he added.\n\nKwidini even assured the acting Speaker Tshuma that if people moved around asking patients who were receiving treatment at government health centres, they were very happy with the service which they were receiving.\n\nOther MPs differed with Kwidinis response.\n\nWe know what is in these hospitals. There is growing inequality. Most people who cannot access quality health services are those who cannot afford.\n\nSo, the societal differences are born out of poverty for most people who go to our hospitals and are told that you have to go and buy a bandage, you have to go and get this medicine, they cannot afford it, Marondera Central MP Caston Matewusaid.\n\nThe acting speaker, Joseph Tshuma dismissed the opposition MP saying, if the source of the complaints is from the media, print or whatever and is not verifiable, that cannot be regarded as a source of information.\n\nIf it was based on social media or any other media source, that cannot be debated as a verifiable source, said Tshuma.\n\nHowever, Tshuma was challenged by Mbizo MP C. Madzivanyika.\n\nIf we say we cannot rely on social media to validate issues of national interest, I do not think it is sustainable Mr. Speaker.\n\nThe Minister of Youth raised this issue of problems in the hospitals on his Twitter account and the Minister of Health and Child Care used the Twitter account to respond.\n\nTwitter has verified accounts and unverified accounts. The Minister of Health and Child Cares Twitter account has a blue tick, which indicates that it is a verified account. The same applies to Hon. Machakaires X handles. Above all, Mr. Speaker, can we be furnished with the Order that says social media is not acceptable?\n\nThe matter was not concluded as Tshuma told the house that the matter could only be resolved with both ministers present in Parliamentfor further interrogation and verification purposes.\n\n",

We need to make sure that the pitch is ready for match, added Magwizi.\n\n",
