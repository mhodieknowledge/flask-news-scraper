            "content": "By Sports Reporter\n\nAFTER scoring a consolation goal from the bench against Algeria in a 3-1 defeat, Warriors midfielder Tawanda Chirewa has reportedly left the camp ahead of Mondays match against Qatar.\n\nThe 22-year-old player is reported to have had a fallout with new Warriors coach Mario Marinica, who is alleged to be exhibiting unprofessional conduct towards the players.Marinica is alleged to be insulting players in camp. Among those whom he allegedly attacked are goalkeeper Washington Arubi, Emmanuel Jalai, and Chirewa.Inside sources within the camp have revealed that senior players have since launched a formal complaint to the Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) regarding the coachs conduct.In addressing Chirewas issue, ZIFA has since released a statement clarifying Chirewas withdrawal from the squad ahead of Mondays match against Qatar.ZIFA wishes to inform the nation, the media fraternity, and all that midfielder Tawanda Chirewa has been granted permission to leave the national team camp, as had been agreed prior to the player joining the camp.This decision was reached with the full blessing and consent of ZIFA, after Wolverhampton Wanderers formally requested an opportunity for the player to be assessed by their new technical team as part of their internal preparations for the season ahead.ZIFA emphasises that this development is not a withdrawal, nor does it reflect any dispute or disagreement. Instead, it represents a professional and mutually respectful alignment between the national association and the players parent club, an alignment that prioritises the athletes long-term development while safeguarding Zimbabwes national football interests, read part of the statement.Meanwhile, senior players in the Warriors are said to have threatened to retire from playing international football if Marinica doesnt change his attitude and approach.\n\nThe 22-year-old player is reported to have had a fallout with new Warriors coach Mario Marinica, who is alleged to be exhibiting unprofessional conduct towards the players.\n\nMarinica is alleged to be insulting players in camp.

What is going on? Can I have an explanation from the Whips? Mudenda asked.\n\nZanu PF Chief Whip Pupurai Togarepi informed the Speaker that three committees were away.\n\nAs per your directive in this House, there should not be more than two Committees at a moment a week, but sometimes they just go without even advising the Whips. I am supposed to concur with those who arrange these outreaches. When I came in, I realised there were a few members only to be told that these committees would have gone out without my knowledge. We need to sit down with the administration to ensure that we protect attendance.\n\nResponding, Mudenda emphasised that parliamentary attendance must take precedence.\n\nWhile the public hearings are critical, and I do not know why they should arise after we have had public hearings on the Pre-Budget. There is no excuse why these committees should be out. Absolutely no excuse. The priority is for members to be here in the House as representatives of the people. You are the voice of the people who are not able to be in this august House.\n\nNow, if you are not there, how is their voice going to be heard? So, this must stop forthwith from next week. No committees should go out unless absolutely necessary.\n\nIn recent weeks, MPs have been making what observers describe as outrageous demands, claiming that their allowances are insufficient to meet their personal needs. Lawmakers earn extra money when travelling through additional allowances.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nCBZ Holdings, Zimbabwes largest financial services group by assets and deposits, has posted a 10% increase in profit after tax for the nine months ending 30 September 2025, reaching ZWG1.11 billion, up from ZWG1.01 billion in the same period last year.\n\nPresenting a trading update for the nine months ended 30 September 2025, CBZ Group Chief Legal Advisor and Governance, Rumbidzayi Jakanani, said the growth recorded comes as the countrys macroeconomic environment stabilises, with the ZWG holding steady against the US dollar and inflation easing into single digits.\n\nCBZ Group Chief Legal Advisor and Governance, Rumbidzayi Jakanani\n\nThe Group recorded a profit after tax of ZWG 1.11 billion, representing a 10% increase from ZWG1.01 billion recorded in the same period of the previous year. Total income amounted to ZWG4.23 billion, 58% above the ZWG 2.68 billion reported in the prior year, reflecting stable performance, she said.\n\nWhile the increase in profits may seem modest, it reflects CBZHs strong cost control and strategic diversification, as the bank navigates a period of monetary tightening and stable gold-backed reserves. This stability has allowed CBZH to focus on organic growth rather than hedge against extreme inflation volatility.\n\nTotal income surged 58% to ZWG 4.23 billion, up from ZWG 2.68 billion in 2024, with non-funded income contributing a significant 65% (ZWG 2.75 billion), reflecting a 54% increase year-on-year. This jump in non-interest income underscores CBZHs advantage in transactional banking, supported by its leading deposit base and robust digital channels, which have thrived amid growing electronic payment adoption and a stable exchange rate.\n\nFunded income also grew 66%, reaching ZWG 1.46 billion, as the bank selectively lent into higher-yielding sectors while maintaining strong asset quality, unlike some competitors who have struggled in volatile periods.\n\nThe balance sheet expanded 13% to ZWG 38.93 billion, with deposits rising by 25% to ZWG 27.09 billion. This strong growth in customer deposits has enabled CBZH to maintain a healthy loan-to-deposit ratio while maintaining high liquidity levels. The banks focus on stable, low-cost retail and corporate deposits has helped shield it from risks associated with short-term interbank funding.\n\nCapital adequacy remains strong, with all divisions meeting regulatory requirements. The bank is also planning fresh capital injections for its growth subsidiaries, positioning it for future opportunities in a fragmented market.\n\nLooking ahead, the global economy is expected to record moderate growth on the back of easing inflation, improving financial conditions, and technological productivity gains. The local economy is set to continue on the positive growth trajectory, supported by expected better rainfall season, higher prices for gold, improved energy supply, coupled with the ongoing fiscal reforms that will enhance the ease of doing business, added Jakanani.\n\n",
