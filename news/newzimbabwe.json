            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) has urged businesses to adapt to the emerging reality of sustained inflation decline and adjust their prices in line with the current deflationary trends.\n\nZimbabwes annual inflation, measured in the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency, fell sharply to 32.7% in October from 82.7% in September 2025, with analysts projecting a further drop to between 15% and 20% by December 2025.\n\nQuoting Ben Bernanke, former Chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, CZI noted that deflationary patterns are not artificially induced but stem from underlying economic realities.\n\nThe sources of deflation are not a mystery. Deflation is in almost all cases a side effect of a collapse of aggregate demand a drop in spending so severe that producers must cut prices on an ongoing basis in order to find buyers, the industry lobby group said in its report.\n\nCZI highlighted that ZiG month-on-month inflation has been on a downward trajectory for three consecutive months, dropping to -0.4% in October 2025 from -0.2% in September 2025, the lowest inflation rate recorded so far this year.\n\nHowever, the organisation cautioned that local traders may remain hesitant to reduce prices due to historical fears of economic volatility. It warned that price stickiness, the resistance of market prices to decrease despite changes in the broader economy, could negatively impact market efficiency if left unchecked.\n\nDeflation, the CZI explained, means that goods and services are becoming cheaper in ZiG terms, which benefits consumers in the short term by increasing their purchasing power.\n\nIt also means that consumers who kept ZiG balances in their bank accounts are now able to purchase slightly more goods than what they could have bought in August 2025. If this momentum is maintained, it could significantly enhance confidence in the ZiG, said the CZI.\n\nThe industry body added that the steep fall in inflation largely reflects the fading effects of the September 2024 devaluation, which had sharply driven up the Consumer Price Index (CPI). With month-on-month inflation now well contained, CZI expects further easing in the coming months.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Volker Trk, says that worldwide 90% of cases involving the murder of journalists have gone unresolved amid calls for member states to put in place watertight measures to protect media practitioners.\n\nWhile Zimbabwe has recorded improvements in recent years, as shown by the countrys leap ten places up the Reporters Without Borders 2024 World Press Freedom Index, local journalists still face different types of persecution, including arbitrary arrests, harassment and intimidation prompted by a blend of a hostile legal framework.\n\nJournalists Blessed Mhlanga and Faith Zaba, both from Alpha Media Holdings (AMH), were recently arrested and detained in 2025 on charges of transmitting data messages inciting violence and undermining the authority of or insulting the President, respectively.\n\nAnother UNESCO 2025 report revealed that 63% of women journalists in Zimbabwe have experienced technology-facilitated gender-based violence (TFGBV), including hate speech and cyber harassment, contributing to self-censorship.\n\nOver the past decade, more than one thousand journalists have been killed, in both peacetime and war. In Gaza alone, my Office has documented the killing of 252 journalists since 7 October 2023. And in nearly nine out of ten cases, those who kill journalists around the world have not been brought to justice. This culture of impunity fuels further attacks and undermines freedom of expression, civic space, and ultimately, peace, Trk said.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner made the remarks in a video message to mark the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists, which is commemorated annually on November 2.\n\nHe said journalists who expose injustice and give voice to the voiceless are human rights defenders, yet, across the globe, governments, corporations and criminals threaten, harass and detain them as well as subjecting them to arbitrary detention, to transnational repression, and even murder.\n\nThe UN official said the emergence of new journalisms have been weaponised to amplify abuse, distort reality, and intensify harm including deepfake sexual images, AI-generated defamatory content, and the amplification of misogynistic hate speech through algorithmic tools and bots.\n\nWomen journalists are targeted not only for their reporting, but also because of their gender. They face harassment, sexual violence, and coordinated online attacks designed to silence their voices and strengthen patriarchal norms. Nearly three in four women journalists report that they have been subjected to online violence. This may lead them to self-censor, to leave their jobs, or to live in fear, said Trk.\n\nThe UN official said his office is working to address these challenges by monitoring, documenting and reporting violations against journalists, including online, and advocating with States and technology companies guided by the dimensions of GBV online.\n\nStates have a legal obligation to prevent, investigate, and punish all attacks against journalists  including those that take place online. Technology companies also have responsibilities to respect human rights and to pursue accountability for people who use their platforms and products to perpetrate abuses.\n\nTo end impunity for crimes against journalists, we need stronger, more determined political will, better legal frameworks, and accountability mechanisms that respond to todays digital world, added Trk.\n\n",

When we fought for our independence, we were all based in Tanzania, so to us it is something we would not want to see.\n\nI am quite convinced that they will be able to sit down, iron out their differences and move forward.\n\nChiwengas statement came barely a day after Mnangagwa showered praises on Samia in a congratulatory message posted on his social media platforms.\n\nExpressing his heartfelt congratulations, Mnangagwa described Hassan as a visionary whose victory reflected the trust and confidence Tanzanians had in her.\n\nAnalysts have likened Hassans electoral triumph to late President Robert Mugabes 2008 run-off election, where he did not have any contender after overseeing the bludgeoning of opposition supporters, ordinary villagers and other sections of the Zimbabwean population, Zanu PF suspected to have voted for late democracy icon Morgan Tsvangirai in the initial race.\n\nHassan used a familiar method of banning opposition rallies and detaining opposition figures, such as her rival Tundu Lissu, who is currently facing treason charges.\n\nHer inauguration was a stark contrast to her first, when she took over from late President John Magufuli or her second after winning her first term.\n\nThe event was held in military barracks, under tight security, with none of the usual pomp and fanfare from members of the public, as they were barred.\n\n",
