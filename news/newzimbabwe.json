The remaining 15 months were converted to 825 hours of community service.\n\nMakamba and Mukwamba were each sentenced to 12 months imprisonment, with three months suspended, and the balance converted to 315 hours of community service each.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE 14th edition of the Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba ended on a high note Friday with key stakeholders seizing the Mines and Minerals Development Bill as a golden opportunity to end rampant injustices bedeviling the nation.\n\nDespite the Southern Africa nation being endowed with a cocktail of precious minerals, the majority of the populace generally feels that very little benefits from the extractive sector have been of benefit to them.While millions worth of minerals are siphoned from the country, villagers have endured environmental destruction, broken infrastructure and dust inhaling related diseases with no resources to solve the problems.The gazetting of the Mines and Minerals Bill in June this year presented a window of hope to millions of citizens, who have endured decades of being sidelined under the colonial eras Mines Act.But at the 2025 Environmental Social Governance Conference hosted by Silveira House and the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Organisation (ZELO) during the ZAMI, several participants implored the government to expeditiously address all the problems bedeviling the mining sector through the Bill.Silveira House programmes manager, Dr Alois Madhekeni said his organisation as a faith based entity believes in the promulgation of legislation, which places human dignity at the core.That principle is expected to determine the manner in which both corporations and the government conduct their operations. So, in this case as corporations rush into the mining sector, the question is how is the dignity of the human person and that of communities being protected?He emphasised that mining should not leave the communities worse off economically, socially, health-wise, technologically and culturally as he implored the adoption of a rights-based perspective to mining.If we see these values embedded in the Minerals Amendment Bill, then we will be happy. Our role now as Silveira House is to ensure that communities have access to the document, they analyse it and are geared to adequately provide input, added Madhekeni.ZELO emphasised on the need to put in place a strong legal infrastructure as the gateway to sustainable mining activities across the country.The Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC) implored the government and corporates to be guided by the Biblical guidance, which talks about Godly fairness in enjoying the earth and its gifted abundance.However, the Mines and Mining Development Deputy Minister, Polite Kambamura said gazetting of the MMB is a gesture by the government to engage citizens on the contentious matter.It is a show by the government on its commitment to transparency and inclusivity, leaving no one behind. The Bill was prepared to enhance Zimbabwe as a friendly investment destination, which is investor ready .To make sure that community challenges are dealt with once and for all we brought sustainability into the Bill, he said.Kambamura added that the legal instrument responds to the ever-changing global and local environment. It will open up room for the drafting of the mining policy and cover all the issues which speak to mining.\n\nDespite the Southern Africa nation being endowed with a cocktail of precious minerals, the majority of the populace generally feels that very little benefits from the extractive sector have been of benefit to them.\n\nWhile millions worth of minerals are siphoned from the country, villagers have endured environmental destruction, broken infrastructure and dust inhaling related diseases with no resources to solve the problems.The gazetting of the Mines and Minerals Bill in June this year presented a window of hope to millions of citizens, who have endured decades of being sidelined under the colonial eras Mines Act.But at the 2025 Environmental Social Governance Conference hosted by Silveira House and the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Organisation (ZELO) during the ZAMI, several participants implored the government to expeditiously address all the problems bedeviling the mining sector through the Bill.Silveira House programmes manager, Dr Alois Madhekeni said his organisation as a faith based entity believes in the promulgation of legislation, which places human dignity at the core.That principle is expected to determine the manner in which both corporations and the government conduct their operations.

Our country Zimbabwe is, indeed, on a reversible journey towards vision 2030.\n\nThis modern infrastructure serves as a source of pride for the veterans of the liberation struggle, who fought so that all our people can have a higher quality of life, he said.\n\nThe project will provide 300 residential flats and 750 student apartments.\n\nThe project also provided over 3 000 job opportunities benefiting members of the Zvishavane community and others.\n\nThe local community also benefitted from upgraded water and sanitary systems as well as improved road networks following the introduction of the project.\n\nWork resumed in March last year and has been completed.\n\nMnangangwa said project is a symbol of national unity and progress, adding his government will continue pushing towards achieving such high-quality projects countrywide.\n\nThis is the standard and work we must uphold across all our entities.The residential flats are investments in the dignity of our people through quality living space.\n\nMnangagwa also said the success of this project demonstrates the power of private public partnerships, further applauding the PSPF and its partners.\n\nFirst Mutual Wealth provided the land, while the majority of the capital, approximately 97%, was invested by the PSPF, with First Mutual acting as project manager, according to Douglas Hoto, chairman and group chief executive officer of First Mutual Holdings.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nThe Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) have announced a dramatic venue change, in an unexpected twist in the lead-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers next month.\n\nTheir pivotal clash against South Africas Bafana Bafana, originally slated for South African soil, will now take place at the Obed Itani Chilume Stadium in Francistown, Botswana, on October 10, 2025.\n\nThis decision comes about because Zimbabwe have issues with hosting international matches at home due to a FIFA ban stemming from stadium concerns.\n\nZimbabwe have previously held their home qualifiers in South Africa, specifically utilising popular venues such as Orlando Stadium. The transition to Botswana is seen as a move to create a more logistical and fan-friendly environment for their supporters.\n\nLocal sources from the Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) report that the decision aims to make the match more accessible for both the Warriors fans. The move is significant as the fixture serves as a milestone in South Africas quest for World Cup qualification.\n\nAs it stands, South Africa leads the standings in Group C with 17 points from eight matches, putting them in pole position for qualification. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe languishes at the bottom with only four points, a stark reflection of their struggleshaving won merely two of their last 27 qualifiers since 2010.\n\nThis latest venue change adds further intrigue to a match that, while less critical for Zimbabwes aspirations, could serve as a defining moment for a Bafana squad looking to solidify their World Cup journey.\n\nThe Obed Itani Chilume Stadium, which boasts a capacity of 26,000, has been recognised as a reliable venue, previously hosting Namibia during their World Cup qualifiers, thus demonstrating its capability to cater to international football standards.\n\nThis choice of location not only provides a neutral ground but also enhances accessibility for Zimbabwean fans, who usually faced no challenges attending matches in South Africa.\n\nDespite Zimbabwes elimination from World Cup contention following a disappointing series of resultsincluding losses to Benin and Rwandathis encounter with the Bafana is unlikely to diminish local interest. Providing a stage to showcase talent, the upcoming match may serve more as a platform for national pride and a precursor to the upcoming 2025 Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nHowever, the venue shift has left many fans puzzled; while the location changes, Zimbabwes hopeless position in the qualifiers is still unchanged. The decision ultimately raises questions about ZIFAs administrative strategy, especially as Zimbabwe prepares to face South Africa, Nigeria, and Lesotho, a task that seems more metaphorical than consequential.\n\nThe president of the Botswana Football Association, Tariq Babitseng, confirmed the hosting arrangement, emphasising the significance of this contest for Bafana as they aim for a win to bolster their World Cup bid.\n\nWith anticipation building, all eyes will be on Francistown this October, regardless of the unpredictable journey Zimbabwes Warriors have faced in their World Cup qualifiers.\n\n",
