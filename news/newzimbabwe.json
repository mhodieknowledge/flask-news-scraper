Though she initially knew little about farming, her small subsistence plot now thrives.\n\nOther farms failed or were abandoned, with some new tenants unschooled in agriculture and others  including politicians who were handed land  uninterested.\n\nThere were food shortages and Zimbabwe soon required international aid.\n\nThere was a bit of a tough period through the 2000s and, unfortunately, I think it sort of refuelled racial tensions to an extent, Burger told AFP.\n\nBut being so passionate about farming was the motivator for me to move forward, he said.\n\nMupambawashe moved to the area from the southern city of Bulawayo, around 200 kilometres (125 miles) away.\n\nWhen we first came here in 2001, it was a forest and there was nothing built, she said.Some of the white farmers were angry but we managed to talk to each other in good faith and move forward.\n\nThey never let us down and said, You grabbed the farm, lets see if you can do it. But instead they brought their own tractors and equipment to come and help, which we felt was a nice gesture.\n\nIt was hard in the beginning, especially after irrigation equipment was stolen, and the early failures were embarrassing, Mupambawashe said.\n\nBut today her plot does so well that she only needs to buy in sugar and cooking oil.\n\nBurger leases land from her and lends tractors and expertise.\n\nHis familys land was among the few hundreds that were not seized in the 2000s.\n\nNonetheless, For a long time we became wound up in compensation, said Burger, vice-president of the Commercial Farmers Union of Zimbabwe (CFU) that represents mostly white farmers.\n\nBut it wasnt our purpose. Our purpose was driving agriculture and current agricultural affairs forward, he said.\n\nThis year, some farm owners whose land was confiscated received the first compensation payments after decades of waiting.\n\nThe process has been complex and divisive.\n\nThe government committed to compensation as part of an effort to settle arrears and reform the economy in order to be able to regain access to international credit lines cut two decades ago.\n\nIt announced in 2020 the creation of a fund that would pay out US$3.5 billion for infrastructure on farms but not the land, which it says was taken by force by colonial settlers.\n\nUnable to raise cash, the government in 2023 changed the offer to one percent in cash and the remainder in US dollar denominated treasury bonds.\n\nIn April, the first payments were made to 378 of 780 farmers approved for this scheme.\n\nDeon Theron, who represents the Compensation Steering Committee group of former white farmers, says the introduction of the bonds has annulled the original deal and negotiations need to start over.\n\nThe bonds are unsecured and there is limited recourse in the event of non-performance by government, he told AFP.\n\nThe general feeling amongst the farmers is firstly frustration that after 20-odd years we still have not received anything, Theron said.\n\nBut the Property and Farm Compensation Associationsaid its members would take what is on offer.\n\nThe bonds are under international guarantee, said leader Harry Orphanides, adding that digging in and seeking more from the government would be futile.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/the-new-broadcasting-services-amendment-act-a-legal-analysis/",
            "content": "By Mlondolozi Ndlovu\n\nThe Broadcasting Services Amendment Act No.2, 2025 (Hereinafter referred to as the Act/ Amendment Act) represents a significant shift in Zimbabwes media regulation landscape.\n\nPromulgated as part of broader media law reforms, the amendment aims to align the Broadcasting Services Act [Chapter 12:06] with constitutional principles, technological advancements, and regional best practices.\n\nHowever, while the Act introduces commendable improvements, it also raises substantial concerns regarding media independence, digital rights, and regulatory integrity.\n\nOne of the most notable improvements is the formal recognition of online broadcasting services and digital platforms.\n\nThe Amendment marks an important step in modernising Zimbabwes media regulation by formally recognising internet-based broadcasting such as podcasts, streaming platforms, and social media live streams.\n\nThis is a timely and progressive reform, considering that audience habits have shifted dramatically toward digital content consumption.\n\nBy acknowledging the role of online platforms, the Amendment Act attempts to align Zimbabwes media law with 21st-century realities, where traditional radio and television are no longer the sole or even primary sources of information for many, especially the youth.\n\nThis recognition potentially creates space for digital content creators, entrepreneurial media startups, and community-driven online platforms to operate within a regulated environment. It may also encourage foreign investment and technological innovation in the media space, particularly if it enables licensing frameworks that are fair, transparent and inclusive.\n\nHowever, this alignment is not without risks. While the Act seeks to align with internet and technological developments, it went about it the wrong way by failing to provide a clear and narrow definition of what constitutes an internet broadcasting service.\n\nThis vagueness opens the door to regulatory overreach, where citizen journalists, bloggers, and even social media users could be subjected to licensing requirements meant for large-scale broadcasters.\n\nThe potential for selective enforcement is high, especially in politically sensitive periods such as elections, turning what should be for protective measure into a tool for digital censorship and surveillance.\n\nTherefore, internet-based broadcasting must be anchored in robust safeguards that ensure digital rights, freedom of expression, and non-discriminatory regulation. Without these, the modernisation risks becoming a digital leash, rather than a progressive leap forward.\n\nThe Amendment Act makes a notable attempt to diversify Zimbabwes broadcasting landscape by expanding the categories of services recognised under law.\n\nIn addition to traditional formats such as public, commercial and community broadcasting, the Act now formally includes subscription management services, internet-based broadcasting, webcasting, satellite uplinks, and datacasting services.\n\nThis is a progressive development that reflects the changing nature of global media, where convergence between telecoms, broadcasting, and digital content platforms is increasingly the norm.\n\nBy formally acknowledging these new categories, the Act opens the door for new entrants, especially in the digital and pay-TV sectors, and provides legal recognition for content distributed online.\n\nThis could stimulate competition, technological innovation and audience choice, while also giving a regulatory identity to previously grey areas of media activity such as podcasting and over-the-top services.\n\nIt is also commendable that community broadcasting remains prioritised with clearer licensing and funding support mechanisms introduced to enhance linguistic and cultural inclusion, especially in rural and underrepresented communities.\n\nThe Amendment Act makes a modest but important attempt to enhance womens representation in media governance structures. Specifically, the Act mandates that at least three of the seven BAZ Board members be women.\n\nWhile this quota signals progress, its impact will depend heavily on implementation, transparency in selection processes, and whether these appointments translate into real influence over policy decisions. Meaningful representation goes beyond numbers, it requires creating space for womens voices in content creation, regulation, and media leadership.\n\nOn the other hand, the promotion of community broadcasting services marks a potentially transformative step for inclusive media. The Act provides for a licensing framework that encourages grassroots participation, particularly by marginalised and rural communities. The Amendment Act also states that community broadcasters must predominantly use languages spoken by their target community and ensure community participation in content creation and station governance.\n\nOne of the most glaring flaws in the Amendment Act is the continued lack of institutional independence of the Broadcasting Authority of Zimbabwe (BAZ).\n\nWhile the Act claims to improve regulatory transparency and promote democratic media governance, Section 4 entrenches executive dominance by giving the President sole power to appoint all members of the BAZ Board, merely after consultation with the Minister and the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders.\n\nThis language is intentionally weak; consultation does not require agreement, rendering both the Minister and the Committee effectively powerless to influence the final appointments.\n\nIn practice, this means that the BAZ Board can be composed entirely of individuals handpicked by the executive, with no meaningful public scrutiny, parliamentary oversight, or stakeholder participation. This setup completely undermines the credibility, neutrality, and public trust that a broadcasting regulator must have in a democratic society. Instead of serving the public interest, such a board is highly vulnerable to political patronage, and its decisions especially regarding licensing, content regulation, and sanctions risk being driven by partisan interests rather than constitutional principles.\n\nThis framework violates Section 61 (3) of the Constitution which explicitly requires that broadcasting regulation be exercised by an independent body free from government or political control. By placing appointment powers squarely in the hands of the President, the Act defies the letter and spirit of this constitutional safeguard.\n\nIt also contradicts international best practices such as those outlined in the African Charter on Broadcasting (2001), which calls for the media regulator to be institutionally, functionally, and politically independent.\n\nThe dangers of this arrangement are not hypothetical. Zimbabwes broadcasting history is littered with examples of state-aligned media monopolies, selective licensing, and the exclusion of dissenting voices all enabled by a regulatory body beholden to political elites. Under this amendment, the same system is simply rebranded, not reformed.\n\nThe Act mandates that all motorists pay the ZBC radio license before obtaining vehicle insurance, regardless of whether they use ZBC services. While ostensibly intended to support public broadcasting, in reality, this measure is coercive and opaque.\n\nThe issue is the fact that ZBC is not subject to clear public accountability or independent audit regarding how the collected fees are used. Without legal guarantees of transparency in how these funds are allocated, the measure risks eroding public trust and the system will just resemble a state-sanctioned revenue scheme.\n\nMoreover, funnelling public money exclusively to ZBC an institution historically criticised for political bias, further undermines the principles of public service broadcasting.\n\nA plural funding model where revenues are distributed among a variety of public and community broadcasters could ensure broader support for media diversity and fairness.\n\nA particularly troubling aspect of this provision is the lack of clear, published criteria for obtaining an exemption certificate.\n\nWhile the Act provides a declaration form allowing motorists to swear their vehicle is not equipped with a radio receiver, it does not define how exemption applications are assessed, who qualifies, or what verification procedures are in place.\n\nThis opens the door to inconsistent, subjective or even discriminatory application of the law by ZBC or affiliated agencies. Section 6 of the Amendment Act introduced a provision that requires the BAZ to invite broadcasting license applications at least once every year, subject to the availability of band spectrum. At first glance, this appears to be a progressive step toward greater regulatory consistency and transparency.\n\nMandating an annual call for applications could in theory, create opportunities for new entrants, especially community broadcasters and independent players who have long been excluded from the media landscape.\n\nHowever, this provision is ultimately a mixed bag, and the potential for misuse far outweighs the intended benefits. The conditional phrase subject to the availability of band spectrum is vague, unqualified, and easily exploitable.\n\nIt gives BAZ a built-in excuse to delay or withhold licenses indefinitely, without providing any technical evidence, audit mechanisms or public justification. This loophole hands disproportionate discretion to the regulator, allowing it to arbitrarily block new broadcasters under the guise of spectrum scarcity.\n\nIn reality, spectrum scarcity is no longer a credible justification in the digital era. Advances in digital broadcasting and spectrum sharing technologies have vastly expanded the capacity to accommodate multiple broadcasters within the same frequency range.\n\nOther African countries like Kenya and Tanzania have used digital migration as a chance to open up space for diverse, community-based, and digital-first broadcasters. Zimbabwe, by contrast, appears to be using it to tighten control.\n\nThe progressive element requiring at least one public call for applications per year is undermined by the Authoritys control over timing, criteria, and technical justifications.\n\nApplicants have no right to apply proactively, they are entirely dependent on the Authority initiating the process, which can be delayed indefinitely using the spectrum line as a cover.\n\nThis turns what should be an open licensing framework into a closed, selective, and politically filtered process. Consequently, Section 6 of the Amendment Act merely disguises arbitrary licensing under a technical pretext.\n\nIn conclusion, while the Act introduces some welcome reforms, such as recognising digital broadcasting and expanding service categories, it ultimately falls short of delivering genuine media reform. The continued lack of regulatory independence, vague digital provisions do undermine democratic values.\n\nMlondolozi Ndlovu is the interim MISA Harare Advocacy Chairperson.
