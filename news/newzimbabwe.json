            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, we understand the Minister for Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs recently issued Statutory Instrument 76 of 2025, aiming to digitise titledeedsin Zimbabwe, why now?\n\nVM: Thank you\n\nI think there is a need to understand these legal developments in context. The Deeds Registry is probably one of the most important offices in our country, housing and keeping records of our security documents, including property titles, charitable or family trusts, and financial security instruments such as mortgage bonds. Established through the Deeds Registry Act of 1960, consecutive governments, through various regulations made several attempts over the years to maintain utmost security over the documents and their registry in changing times.\n\nRecent cases alleging in deed registration processes either through collusion with staff members in the deeds registration process or outright forgery, case in point, the Matumbuka case, have necessitated further security measures in line with International best practices, already undergoing implementation in other jurisdictions like South Africa, Namibia, Australia and the United Kingdom. I mention these countries because a significant number of our diaspora are residents there.\n\nHence, these new regulations\n\nReporter: What will be the new look of the digital title deed?\n\nVM: The idea is to standardise the title deeds to be issued going forward. This will include the titles being on special security paper supplied by a single supplier so it is easily identifiable and verifiable. Further, how the title deed will be drawn up will also be prescribed for the conveyancers, this will include font size, type of ink, what happens when the alterations are on the deedet cetera.\n\nThe digital copy will be maintained at the deeds office, and a physical copy with the above features issued to the deed owner.\n\nThe import is to reduce the options for fraud.\n\nReporter: What happens to the title deeds that were issued before the statutory instrument publication?\n\nVM: That is a good question. The new regulations acknowledge the new securitised deeds and the old title deeds, which refer to the deeds people are holding in Zimbabwe as of this date.\n\nThe idea is to integrate the current title deeds to become securitised deeds within 24 months.\n\nThis means that the holders of current title deeds are required to submit their original title deeds and documents to the deeds registry within 24 months so that they are validated. The Registrar will then check whether the documents comply with the regulations. Once the documents are validated, the Registrar will issue the securitised deed on special paper to the holder of title and a digital copy will be maintained at the Registrars office.\n\nWe are anticipating a supporting implementation framework from the Registrars office on how the process will be implemented in actual terms, including the attendant fees.\n\nReporter: What other measures have also been introduced to ensure that the securitised deeds system is secure?\n\nVM: The regulations prescribe that lawyers follow strict identity procedures when drafting deeds and power of attorney. There is a requirement that the documents be notarised. Digital log-ins on the system will be traceable for any person dealing with a particular property in the securitised system, which will allow for a digital footprint should any work be attended to on a particular securitised deed.\n\nLong and short, it will be easier for the authorities to identify when and by who should a complaint be made on a certain deed.\n\nIn addition, criminal sanctions for fraud have been included in the regulations which target Registry or government employees who collude with or assist fraudsters to tamper with deeds.\n\nReporter: Mr. Madzima, what is your personal view on the new system?\n\nVM: I believe the system will go a long way in modernising our deeds registration system by improving security and transparency, thereby reducing instances of fraud involving the deeds office or peoples property titles. It will also assist property practitioners in verification of title processes as it will be more efficient and reliable from away from the manual paper system to a digital and more efficient system.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have to end here because of our time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nEXPERTS last week unpacked the Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill to legislators and mining stakeholders amid calls to consider provisions that ensure small-scale indigenous miners are prioritised due to their significant output ahead of foreigners.\n\nAlso topical was the issue of Cadastre Registry and funding of artisanal miners in the sector.\n\nMembers of Parliament (MPs) warned of chaos if some parts of the proposed law, alleged to be pro-foreign investors than local people, were not amended as expected by the generality of the populace.\n\nAccording to Mines Committee Chairperson and Bindura South MP Remigious Matangira, the Bill must have Zimbabweans as priority and not foreigners.\n\nArtisanal miners are producing 60% of all these minerals especially gold. To my surprise, they are not even mentioned in in the Bill.\n\nThe small-scale miner has been restricted now to 48 hectares onlyStill, the view is favouring the foreign minds.\n\nOur Bill should not want to take investors to be the foreign people that come into the country as investors. It is good to be us, we are good to graduate, to be the owners of our land, our culture, and gradually they will move forward, Matangira said amid applause from other MPs.\n\nOf concern to the Mines Committee chairperson was the Cadastre Registry system structure as presented by the government legal counsel.\n\nThe Cadastre Registry establishes a Mining Cadastre Registry headed by the Secretary of Mines and it mandates the disclosure of beneficial ownership of mining rights, empowering the Registrar to demand sworn declarations and cancel titles where beneficial owners are not properly disclosed.\n\nThe system creates the Mining Cadastre Register as the definitive record of all mining rights and titles in Zimbabwe, accessible online for public inspection.\n\nMatangira, warned:: You know we are coming in with a Cadastre system. It will cause more serious issues than we ever saw.\n\nHe urged the Bill to amended to speak to what the people of Zimbabwe are making for their minerals.\n\nNyanga North MP Supa Mandiwanzira also chipped in suggesting that the\n\ncountry has a fantastic opportunity to shape the mining sector that could make millionaires and billionaires out of blacks as part of the resources that are available home.\n\nTheres no mining that takes place in this country without the traditional leadership. It does not matter where that investor is coming from.\n\nYou have to have consultation with the traditional leadership, but theyre not being represented on the mining affairs board.\n\nI would like them in adjustment that the traditional leaders are appointed to that specific board.\n\nMandiwanzira added, there is something heartbreaking happening in our country, which I think this law must impress.\n\nThere is nothing technologically innovative about a heaping fence or processing fence and taking that money outside the country. We are seeing alluvial, chrome mining, alluvial gold mining even on the rivers being done by foreigners. Basic thing that does not need technology.\n\nThe investors from outside must bring technology to do things we cant do. This law must restrict alluvial mining, river mining, whether its chrome or gold, to indigenous people\n\nMandiwanzira called for exclusive, prospective license (EPL) period to be limited from 12 years to only six.\n\nIf you have not found anything in 12 years, what are you still doing there? I believe that this period must not be extended to 12 years. I think it must come to six years, said Mandiwanzira.\n\nOn traing Mandiwanzira said, Whats happening in this country is heartbreaking. A lot of foreigners are approaching people who are holding claims because our people are desperate.\n\nThey are giving away these claims in return for 10% of what comes out of there. That money is not building our country. Its being shipped outside the country.\n\nBut if our people are training to understand that the value they are giving away is far more than what these guys are bringing, We would not have those things that are heartbreaking taking place.\n\nThis Bill must provide the necessity to educate all our people about the relevance and the criticality of mining.\n\nWe saw a big deal happen in the sale of Prospect Mining to Huayo Cobalt in China, $450 million.\n\nIts money that has exchanged hands outside of our territory, no tax accrual to our country. But this, what is about with assets being sold, this law does not address how that is going to be handled to ensure that the exchange of ownership of assets, whether it is on the Australian Stock Exchange, the London Stock Exchange or the Canadian Stock Exchange, benefits the tax collection in our own country. I did not see any provision of that in this situation, the MP said.\n\nAnother MP spoke of value addition and the beneficiation.\n\nHow practically are we putting some measures to make sure that there is no continuous mining without value addition and proficiency?\n\nSpeaker Jacob Mudenda spoke about several issues as he gave his personal opinion.\n\nExploration needs to be done as a compelling exercise. Where are the minerals?.\n\nHe spoke of value addition and benefiation, artisanal miners resource development (provision of a fund) , indigenisation and authorisation of the mining industry and the Cadastre system, which he said, were a must in the Bill to be included.\n\nArtisanal miners are producing 60% and fund them so that they can go to 90% in the end.\n\nThe Cadastre system, the Bill does not create the harm. The Cadastre system is going to be harmonised nationally. We should have one Cadastre system that can be used by not only the Mines and Mining Development ministry, but a new contract that must have access to that, and other ministries that are involved in the development of issues that should be used and therefore, they should be clearly engaged with this affair generally, in terms of the mapping.\n\nIt is very important. As long as the Cadastre system is not in place, then we have not started, said Mudenda.\n\n",
