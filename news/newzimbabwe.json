There were 44 rejected ballots.\n\nVoter apathy characterised the plebiscite, with turnout pegged at 17,2% of Glen View Souths registered voter population of 31 519.\n\nThe seat fell vacancy after the death of Grandmore Hakata.\n\nCommenting on Zanu PFs by-election victory, award-winning journalist and political observer, Hopewell Chinoono blamed the divided opposition for the result, suggesting the alternative is dead.\n\nToday, Glen View is in the hands of Zanu PF for the first time in 25 yearsnot because Zanu PF has done anything fantastic, but because it faces an opposition built around a popular personality, not ideas or a cause.\n\nMany of us think of ourselves as educated, but education is not the certificates we holdit is the ability to use the knowledge we gained from school to think and compute ideas, said Chinoono.\n\nWhat is happening today was predicted on this page in 2022; that without a structured opposition with a Constitution, Zanu PF would pounce.\n\nBut as usual, I was insulted and told about a plan called strategic ambiguity. What happened to the plan?\n\nZanu PF will be in power with a huge majority post 2028 if things remain the way they are. Reality does not hero-worship personalitiesit favours common sense.\n\nThe reality of politics is that if it is hinged on personalities rather than ideas and a cause, the regime becomes stronger because it either buys or immobilises those personalities.\n\nThe MDC survived as long as it did because Morgan Tsvangirai, for the most part, was not threatened by those more educated or more talented than himhe was secure. The pastor is not.\n\nTsvangirai understood the importance of structures and of allowing leaders at various levels to be independent and strong.\n\nWhat you saw in Glen View is the beginning of the total end of the 1999 project, he added.\n\nThe current opposition leaders are the best thing that has ever happened to Zanu PF, Chinoono opined.\n\nWhy would you not want people who are hero-worshipped yet do nothingwho cannot even speak-out about corruption or draconian laws against the citizens?\n\nWhenever you see infighting in Zanu PF, it means there is no opposition to speak of. We are in the worst period Zimbabwe has experienced since 1999. The citizens must be told the truth; 2028 is gone save for a miracle!\n\nThe oppositions emphasis on personalities rather than ideas and causes is a recurring issue that has weakened the opposition and strengthened the regime.\n\nChinoono further stated that the lack of a clear and consistent message from the opposition on critical issues like corruption and draconian laws is a reflection of a failed leadership.\n\nIt is strange that you have adults who defend the mediocrity of their leaders, it is mind boggling as it is sad to watch! It is like watching a man self-harm yet you cant do anything about it! Continue to fool yourselves!\n\n",

Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator in Sudan Clementine Nkweta-Salami.\n\nEl-Fasher is under the control of the military, which has fought the RSF since Sudan descended into civil war two years ago, killing more than than 24,000 people, according to the United Nations, though activists say the number is likely far higher.\n\nThe camps were attacked again on Saturday, Nkweta-Salami said in a statement. She said that nine aid workers were killed while operating one of the very few remaining health posts still operational in Zamzam camp.\n\nThis represents yet another deadly and unacceptable escalation in a series of brutal attacks on displaced people and aid workers in Sudan since the onset of this conflict nearly two years ago, she said.\n\nNkweta-Salami didnt identify the aid workers but Sudans Doctors Union said in a statement that six medical workers with the Relief International were killed when their hospital in Zamzam came under attack on Friday.\n\nThey include Dr. Mahmoud Babaker Idris, a physician at the hospital, and Adam Babaker Abdallah, head of the group in the region, the union said.It blamed the RSF for this criminal and barbaric act.\n\nThe offensive forced about 2,400 people to flee the camps and el-Fasher, according to the General Coordination for Displaced Persons and Refugees, a local group in Darfur.\n\nZamzam and Abu Shouk shelter more than 700,000 people who have been forced to flee their homes across Darfur during past bouts of fighting in the region, Nkweta-Salami said.\n\nLate last month, the Sudanese military regained control over Khartoum, a major symbolic victory in the war. But the RSF still controls most of Darfur and some other areas.\n\nThe two camps are among five areas in Sudan where famine was detected by the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification, IPC, a global hunger monitoring group.\n\nThe war has created the worlds largest humanitarian crisis, with about 25 million people  half of Sudans population  facing extreme hunger.\n\n",

            "content": "By IOL\n\nANOTHER day, another slay, and this time, Tyla is front and centre on the April cover of Nylon magazine, continuing her reign as one of the most stylish stars on the planet.\n\nAt just 23, the South African singer is not only delivering bangers on stage but serving fashion fantasy in every editorial shoot. This latest spread is no different: bold looks, sharp silhouettes, and that effortless cool only she can pull off.\n\nTylas feature comes hot off the heels of an impressive list of magazine covers. In just over a year, shes graced the pages of British Vogue, Elle US, Billboard, Cosmopolitan, BeatRoute, T Magazine from The New York Times, and Dazed.\n\nEach shoot has spotlighted her meteoric rise from Johannesburg girl to global It-girl, never shying away from showcasing her roots.\n\nNylon magazine is considered a cool-girl staple in the fashion and pop culture world not necessarily massive like Vogue or Elle, but highly influential among Gen Z and millennial readers.\n\nIn her interview, Tyla opens up about the whirlwind of fame and how her family is riding the wave alongside her. She shared a funny moment when a fan DMd her with a photo, not of her, but of her mum.\n\nThey ask me for pictures, too, Tyla, her mother told her. Fame, it seems, runs in the family now. But its not all glitz and red carpets.\n\nTyla is taking her artistry seriously and isnt afraid to shake things up.\n\nOne day, youre going to get that Tyla rap song, she teased, hinting that theres much more to her than catchy Amapiano hooks and glossy visuals.\n\nShes taking her time with her next album, wanting to showcase a fuller picture of who she is beyond what people expect.\n\nIm excited to show people that Im more diverse than they think. I want to take my time with my artistry and give whatever feels right for that moment.\n\nWhen asked where shed take fans to understand her music better, she didnt hesitate: the CBD in Johannesburg. Its the chaos, the culture, the sound of taxis, shouting, and local music blaring from every corner that inspired her growing up, and that energy still pulses through her dance tracks.\n\nYou can hear our music playing loud. You can hear our accents, people shouting, taxis driving crazy. I would take people there because that feels like how my dance music feels, I think, she said.\n\nOn the topic of representation, Tyla shared her dreams of seeing African music  pure and unfiltered  become just as global as pop.\n\nI would love to see an African artist even if the artist isnt born and raised on the continent make African music without pop influences, just true African music. I would love to see that be as global as pop music is one day, she said.\n\nNot watered down, not reshaped to fit a Western mould. And even if shes not the one to push it all the way, shes rooted in who she is.\n\nIm an African girl, and Im always going to be, she added.\n\n",
