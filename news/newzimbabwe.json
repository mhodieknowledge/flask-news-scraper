I am consulting. I am building. I am assembling a new strategy and a citizens team that will carry and pivot this nation unto greatness and stardom, Chamisa wrote on his X account, Thursday.\n\nHe described his departure from the CCC as disembarking from a ship that was leaking and could have jeopardised the democratic project he is striving to realise in Zimbabwe.\n\nI left CCC but not the mission. All because CCC was never the destination. It was just the vehicle meant to take us to the New Zimbabwe. When that vehicle was compromised, it became necessary to step out and prepare a better, cleaner, fit-for-purpose vehicle, he explained.\n\nChamisa further acknowledged the mistakes he made during his time at the helm of the CCC.\n\nOur approach in 2023 was not the same as 2018, because in the fight against oppression, no strategy is cast in stone. This is a battle to save lives and to save a nation. We sometimes miss. We sometimes omit. We commit. We adjust. We correct. We keep moving forward until we win. And win we must.\n\nNone of this would have been possible without you.\n\n",

She therefore has no capacity to interfere with members of the ZRP investigating this case.\n\nThe accused is a fit candidate for bail. She is a mother of two and the solebreadwinner of her family.\n\nIn addition to her children, she also takes care of a niece who is totally dependent on her and also her mother, aged 70.\n\nMhike said Zaba is of fixed abode, adding that she is employed as an editor.\n\nShe needs to go back to work soon after she recuperates from her current ill health.\n\nThe accused before you is an award-winning journalist well respected in Zimbabwe Media, commercial, human rights and philanthropic circles, he said.\n\nCourt was also told of her other colourful accolades in media circles, including being the Secretary General of the Zimbabwe National Editors Forum (ZINEF), a mentor, and a member of the Women in News organisation, as such a responsible person to be trusted with freedom.\n\nThis shows she is a distinguished member of the society, Mhike said.\n\nThe lawyer also said Zaba did not give the police trouble when she was arrested.\n\nShe made every effort to honour the request by the police for her to attend at the police station.\n\nShe voluntarily walked into Harare Central Police Station in the company of her lawyer.\n\nIt is regrettable that the police did not allow her to go home after the recording of her warned and cautioned statement, he said.\n\nCitizens who honour and respect authorities ought to be spared from harsh prison realities. As indicated, the accused is not feeling well and the veracity of that submission is documented.\n\nHowever, Mhike raised a complaint against the police, saying, Our complaint is that the accused was detained overnight even in the face of comprehensive medical documentation confirming that she was on bed rest on the order of a medical doctor.\n\nJambawu said police officers and some of Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) employees are lined up to testify against Zaba.\n\nZaba is represented by Mhike andNontokozo Dube Tachiona.\n\n",

            "content": "The success of digital betting platforms increasingly depends on the quality of payment solutions. In Africa, fast and reliable transactions are not just an option  they are essential. Payment providers now play a central role in how users deposit, withdraw, and manage funds on betting sites.\n\nIn markets like Liberia, mobile wallets and local payment apps make up most transactions. Platforms like the1xbet.com.lr.work with providers that allow instant transfers and reduce dependency on traditional banks. This makes betting more accessible, especially in rural areas where bank coverage remains limited.\n\nHow Payment Integration Shapes the User Experience\n\nDigital users expect smooth onboarding. A delay in depositing funds can push users away. Fast approval, low fees, and multiple payment formats create a trusted environment. In Liberia, mobile-first habits influence every aspect of digital interaction, including gaming and financial platforms.\n\nPlatforms integrate local mobile money services, bank APIs, and QR-based payments. This meets user needs for flexibility and control. Betting apps that support these services gain more traction and better user ratings. One example is thehttp://1xbet.com.lr/en/mobile, which combines fast financial access with clear interfaces and fast response times.\n\nPayment solutions also influence retention. Players are more likely to return if they can access winnings quickly and safely. Delays or failed withdrawals hurt trust and slow down platform growth. Well-integrated providers reduce these risks by ensuring seamless communication between systems.\n\nLive Features and Analytics in Real-Time Systems\n\nAs live betting grows, real-time transaction capability becomes a top feature. Users want to place a bet, receive confirmation, and monitor the odds without lag. This requires payment systems that update instantly and handle high volumes.\n\nIn Liberia, internet speed may vary, so efficient systems matter more. Betting platforms must adjust for regional connection limits. At the same time, they need to deliver smooth live markets. Users engaged inlive betting on 1xBet liberiaexpect fluid betting without financial or technical blocks.\n\nPayment data is also valuable. Platforms usedata analyticsto track trends, monitor risk, and personalise offers. Fast systems provide accurate snapshots of user spending. This allows companies to improve service, manage limits, and flag unusual activity before it becomes a problem.\n\nFeatures That Make Payment Providers Competitive\n\nTo serve betting platforms well, providers need more than fast processing. They must be safe, affordable, and compatible with mobile use. The following features are essential:\n\nThese features improve platform reputation. Users rate apps based not just on games or odds but also on how easy it is to manage money. Payment issues are a top reason users delete betting apps. Efficient providers directly improve user satisfaction.\n\nThe Future of Betting Will Be Payment-Driven\n\nDigital entertainment depends more than ever on financial tools.Betting platformsthat want to grow must offer advanced payment integration from the start. In Africa, where mobile usage outpaces traditional banking, this matters even more.\n\nIn Liberia, the next step may be partnerships between providers and telecom networks. These deals can unlock free data, discounted fees, or exclusive offers. For users, this means greater value and faster service. For platforms, it means more loyal customers.\n\nWith trusted payment services, digital betting can grow responsibly. Providers will remain key to making this market secure, accessible, and scalable for every new user.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/how-to-avoid-common-traps-in-basketball-betting/",
            "content": "Basketball betting is fast-paced and full of opportunities. It also brings risks, especially for those who follow teams without checking the numbers. Many new bettors focus only on form or recent wins, missing the deeper data that shapes match outcomes.\n\nPlatforms used across West Africa are improving, making more data and tools available to players. The1xbet.gm.offers features that help users avoid basic mistakes, such as incomplete stats or delayed updates. However, even with the best tools, players must understand where they can go wrong.\n\nUnderstanding the Most Frequent Errors\n\nStatistics and movement drive basketball markets. Many players forget this and base their bets on recent headlines or team reputation. Others rush bets without reviewing lineups or injury reports. This creates losses that could be avoided with basic preparation.\n\nAnother mistake is ignoring game context. Back-to-back matches, travel schedules, and motivation levels all affect performance. If you skip this step, you are betting in the dark. Using reliable sources and updated platforms reduces that risk.\n\nSome users turn to mobile tools for quick access. With thehttp://www.1xbet.gm/en/mobile, bettors track odds, match updates, and team status in one space. This makes it easier to react before odds change.\n\nKey Areas That Often Mislead Bettors\n\nTo reduce poor outcomes, players must spot the typical traps. Below are key reasons why many basketball bets fail:\n\nIn Gambia, many betting fans join group chats or online forums. These help discuss picks and point out match-day alerts. However, it is also easy to be misled by hype or rumours. Balance is key.\n\nTools and Bonuses That Support Better Picks\n\nModern apps and platforms now offer advanced support. Players can check injury reports, betting trends, and odds comparisons. These tools help filter emotions from real value.\n\nBettors who rely on verified features get better results. For example, users can explore new offers throughsports betting on 1xbet gambia, where live games and data updates run smoothly. This system helps avoid stale information.\n\nMany users also join with promo offers. One common method is to use a promo code for extra rewards, which adds bonus funds or reduced limits. These offers are useful if used carefully, especially during tournaments.\n\nRules and Requirements Often Overlooked\n\nSome bettors face losses not from the match, but from misunderstanding platform rules. Cash-out restrictions, time-limited bonuses, and game-type exclusions often surprise users. Always checkwagering requirementsbefore using bonuses or placing combo bets.\n\nUnderstanding rules is just as important as picking the right team. You might win a bet but lose the reward if the conditions are not met. Most platforms explain this clearly, but many players skip the small print.\n\nSerious bettors use notebooks, spreadsheets, or app tools to track their habits. This helps identify weak spots and reduce repeated mistakes.\n\nLearning from Data and Planning Ahead\n\nGood bettingis based on observation. Top bettors do not just follow trends. They study how teams perform under pressure, which players close out games, and how coaches rotate their squads.\n\nIn basketball, second-half scores often differ from first-half stats. Smart users adjust at half-time or shift their focus to live markets. Data tools can guide that process and suggest alternate bets.\n\nKeeping a long-term view also protects players from emotional bets. After a loss, the goal is not to recover instantly but to reset with better decisions.\n\nFinal Thoughts on Smarter Basketball Bets\n\nAvoiding common traps begins with discipline. Successful basketball betting does not depend only on luck. It comes from research, updated tools, and reading each game correctly.\n\nReliable apps support fast access and clear navigation. This saves time and helps make quicker decisions. Matching those tools with basic strategy improves results.\n\nFrom injury reports to betting limits, the smallest details can decide the outcome. Learning to manage them builds confidence, consistency, and better outcomes over time. In Gambia and beyond, basketball bettors who plan well enjoy the game more and win more often.\n\n",

Parts of Harare and its surrounding suburbs were especially hard hit, and in the aftermath, attention fell on the unreliability of the capital citys aging infrastructure. The government ultimately secured a US$144 million loan from China Exim Bank to overhaul the citys water treatment network.\n\nThe promised upgrades never came, but now, the city wants ratepayers to foot the bill with a water levy introduced in March.\n\nThe loaned funds were supposed to upgrade water treatment plants, and pump stations, and roll out prepaid meters for 500,000 households.\n\nNow, almost two decades later, citizens are being asked to repay a loan they say brought them no benefit.\n\nIf the water situation had improved, maybe it would make sense, says Prudence Hanyani, who was born and raised in Mabvuku, a suburb of the capital city that falls in its service area. We never saw infrastructure development or better services. So what exactly are we paying for?\n\nHarares daily water production has steadily declined over the years due to a mix of deferred maintenance, contamination, and leaky pipes and valves in the distribution network, according to a 2015 World Bank report. In 2005, the city produced approximately 600 megaliters each day  thats 600 million liters, or 158.5 million gallons, enough to fill 240 Olympic-size swimming pools. By 2008, daily output dropped to around 400 megaliters, then fluctuated between 400 and 600 megaliters over the next few years. However, by February this year, the supply had fallen further to just 350 megaliters per day.\n\nHarare needs more than three times that amount, some 1,200 megaliters per day (317 million gallons), to meet the needs of residents and businesses, says Hardlife Mudzingwa, director of the advocacy group Community Water Alliance.\n\nWhat was a government responsibility is now being offloaded onto ordinary households already grappling with economic hardship, says Mudzingwa, who has petitioned the government to account for how the money was used.\n\nTaps in Mabvuku ran dry around the year 2000, Hanyani says, and residents havent had running water since. With six children to care for, she now spends up to US$3 a day to buy water for drinking, cooking, cleaning and sanitation, an added burden in a country where the average monthly household income fell to just US$88 in 2024. Now an additional water levy of US$1 is expected from her each month.\n\nPrudence Hanyani collects water from a disused chicken brooder where she stores her household supply. Hanyani, who has lived without running water for over two decades, now faces a new government-imposed water levy tied to a failed Chinese loan project that promised but never delivered improved infrastructure.

Key projects, such as the Harare water and sewer upgrade and major dam developments, have been financed through loans, particularly from China Exim Bank. But many of these projects, including the Harare upgrade, stalled after loan disbursements were suspended due to contract breaches.\n\nZimbabwe turned to China for loans in the early 2000s primarily due to limited access to more established financing sources, following years of economic sanctions, political isolation and a deteriorating credit rating. China emerged as a willing lender, offering infrastructure loans and investments under its Belt and Road initiative and Zimbabwes Look East policy. However, the country has faced challenges in repaying these loans, leading to significant arrears.\n\nIn 2018, China Exim Bank provided a US$153 million government concessional loan for the expansion of the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport. While the project aimed to increase the airports capacity from 2.5 million to 6 million passengers annually, it was hampered by delays and financial mismanagement. By the end of 2021, Zimbabwe had accumulated $3 million in arrears on the loan.\n\nSimilarly, the Victoria Falls Airport Renovation and Expansion Project relied on a US$149.9 million loan, issued in 2012. The project was completed in 2016, but Zimbabwes arrears still ballooned to US$54 million by the end of 2021.\n\nThe Chinese water and sewer loan came at a time when various partners were funding infrastructure upgrades in the sector, Mudzingwa says. Following the 2008 cholera outbreak, international development partners including the United Nations Childrens Fund, the African Development Bank and the World Bank stepped in with additional support. In Harare, much of that funding was frittered away as the city failed to consult with residents in project planning or install systems to track revenue, manage budgets and detect fraud and waste. As a result, there has never been clarity on how exactly the money was used, even as millions of Zimbabweans have been left without access to safe, reliable water.\n\nThe China Exim Bank water loan had an 11-year repayment term with a four-year grace period and variable interest set at roughly 3.5%.\n\nAlthough the project officially began in 2013, progress quickly stalled when Zimbabwes failure to repay an earlier loan prompted the bank to freeze disbursements. The earlier loan was for planned renovations to the dormant state-owned steel enterprise Ziscosteel, which were never completed. Harare City Council spent US$8 million from the water treatment loan on 25 luxury vehicles. The council claimed the cars were necessary for service delivery, but the lender disagreed. By 2017, only half the loan had been released, and disbursements remained frozen through 2020.\n\nAs of 2021, the Harare water project alone accounted for nearly US$67 million in unpaid debt. Across its portfolio, Zimbabwe owed China Exim Bank more than US$260 million in arrears spanning numerous sectors, from telecommunications to airports to defense.\n\nWe are the ones drinking water, says Harare Mayor Jacob Mafume. Surely if Harare residents are drinking the water, they should pay for it themselves instead of asking the tax dollar of some Chipinge resident busy chasing a big frog.\n\nWard 16 councillor Denford Ngadziore is calling for an audit. If there are people who misused the money, they should be prosecuted. I presented this solution in the full council meeting, but other councilors disagreed with me, he says. We cannot make residents pay the loan without a clear report on how the loan was used.\n\nViolet Razau carries a bucket of water to her home in Mabvuku. Like many residents in this suburb of Harare, she has relied on makeshift sources for years. Despite having received no benefit from a long-stalled water project funded by a Chinese loan, residents are now expected to repay it through monthly levies. Credit: Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nMafume insists that everything was done above board, arguing that the Land Rover Defenders and Amarok pickup trucks purchased for the project were not, in fact, luxury vehicles and that the utility has been hampered by its inability to purchasewater treatment chemicals, which cost some US$3 million a month, according to the mayors office. By and large, the equipment that was bought is there for anyone to go and see. And the good thing is that the new pumps and the old pumps, you can see the difference in performance, he says. Look at the old pumps, they look like they can explode at any time. So the work that the Chinese did on the plant speaks for itself.\n\nMudzingwa argues that the loan acquisition process itself was flawed because a section of Zimbabwes 2013 Constitution says that any international treaty signed or carried out by the president or on the presidents behalf is not legally binding unless it is first approved by Parliament.\n\nHe says the provision reinforces the principle of legislative oversight in the treaty-making process. The agreement was ratified by council in December 2013, but by then, the money had already been spent. Ratification should have come first, he says.\n\nMudzingwa also disputes the mayors contention that promised equipment upgrades were made. Theres no visible infrastructure to justify the cost. Now, residents are being asked to pay for a loan they didnt benefit from. Thats unfair, he says.\n\nMudzingwa worries the levy sets a precedent for ordinary citizens to foot the bill for loan projects characterized by improper procedure, opaque spending and unaccountable leadership.\n\nZimbabwes experience mirrors similar challenges seen in other countries reliant on Chinese infrastructure financing. Zambia canceled US$1.6 billion in undisbursed Chinese loans in 2022 amid a mounting debt crisis, while Sri Lanka was forced to award a Chinese company a 99-year lease on a newly-built port after defaulting on construction loans China had provided.\n\nBack in Mabvuku, the water struggle remains deeply personal.\n\nViolet Razau, a hairdresser and mother of two, has lived in the area since 1998. As a child, I watered our garden with a hose. My 13-year-old son has never seen that. Now, I dont even get a drop from council taps, so why should I pay?\n\nFor Hanyanis 70-year-old mother, Precious Mudimu, age has made the crisis harder. I cant carry water buckets. I rely on others, but theyre not always around. Im old, I cant work to pay levies, she says. This place feels like a desert.\n\nLinda Mujuruis a Reporter-in-Residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.
