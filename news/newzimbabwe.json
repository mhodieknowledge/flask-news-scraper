May they possess the insight to listen to the voices of their electorate, addressing their concerns with genuine care and appropriate assistance.We turn to Proverbs 11:14, which says, Where there is no counsel, the people fall; but in the multitude of counsellors, there is safety.Let us pray that our leaders surround themselves with wise counsel and make decisions that reflect the best interests of those they serve. They must remember their sacred duty as bastions of the rule of law, upholding the trust placed in them by the people.It is imperative that they do not become consumed by the cycle of elections, but rather invest their time in fulfilling their electoral promises, embodying the values they espoused in their manifestos.Heavenly Father, we ask You to grant our president and all leaders the capacity to lead with empathy and compassion. May they recognise the weight of their responsibilities and act in accordance with Your will.We pray that they govern with integrity, transparency, and a commitment to the common good, demonstrating the love and service that You call us to.PrayerDear Lord,We ask for Your guidance and wisdom to fill the hearts of our leaders. Help them to listen and respond to the needs of their people with grace and integrity. May they honour the trust bestowed upon them and serve as true representatives of justice and mercy.Strengthen them to act not just in their own interest, but for the welfare of all. We pray that they lead by example, embodying the principles of empathy and the rule of law.

During the process, the government provides for the basics like food, shelter and clothing.However, when there are challenges, I request that if there is a specific jail, then that communication should be brought forward so that we will be able to address it properly, Masuka said.The Speaker urged the MP to name those prisons without blankets and food.The question should address the jails that do not have blankets, Mudenda said.Before he could finish his statement, Zemura shouted all jails.Mudenda posed a question to the MP before advising her to put her question in writing and to be specific.Did you go to all the jails, Hon.
