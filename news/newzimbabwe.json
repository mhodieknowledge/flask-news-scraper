A considerable amount of resources was invested to guarantee its success. It is unlikely that an operation of this scale could have achieved its goals without substantial financial support.\n\nFor the record Mr Kudakwashe Tagwirei put in a total of 5 million litres of fuel, food and other provisions for soldiers as requested by the then CDF, General Chiwenga. Furthermore, he put in one million litres of fuel and US$1.6 million to the Party.\n\nTherefore, the success of Operation Restore Legacy cannot be attributed to a few individuals. Any such assertions are aimed at distorting the historical narrative for personal and political gain, said Ziyambi.\n\nTagwirei, who is a benefactor of ZANU PF, has recently been accused of using his proximity to President Emmerson Mnangagwa to acquire government tenders.\n\nThe controversial entrepreneur has also been the subject of attacks by former ZANU PF member and fugitive Blessed Geza, who has accused him of capturing the state and perpetuating corruption.\n\nTagwirei has remained mum on the allegations of corruption.\n\nZiyambi said the removal of Mugabe was a collective effort, warning a clique backing Chiwenga to desist from claiming heroism.\n\nIt is denied that only a few individuals, particularly the writers of this document, sacrificed their lives for the attainment of Operation Restore Legacy. Zimbabweans from all walks of life rose and participated in and supported Operation Restore Legacy.\n\nLet us acknowledge the collective effort that made Operation Restore Legacy possible and desist from claiming heroism for work done by many, said Ziyambi.\n\n",

            "content": "AP\n\nInside a white tent with a wooden fireplace in the middle, about two dozen African girls slipped off their shoes, sat on mattresses and prepared to pour their hearts out.\n\nThey held hands and their chants of its so nice to be here echoed through the tent before they set about discussing sexuality, child marriage, teen pregnancy, gender bias, education, economic empowerment and the law. Nothing was off limits.\n\nThe girls hangout in rural northeasternZimbabweis a revival of Nhanga, the local term for girls bedroom, an ancient traditional space once used to prepare adolescent girls for marriage. Across rural Zimbabwe, girls are now reinventing the centuries-old practice as a peer-led movement to resist child marriage, which is rife in the southern African nation.\n\nThis is a safe space, every girl feels free, said 18-year-old Anita Razo, who joined at 14 and now mentors younger girls.\n\nIn traditional homesteads, a round thatched hut served as Nhanga, a female-only room where girls were taught obedience, how to please husbands and moral education. It reinforced patriarchal expectations.\n\nToday, the practice is being flipped. The new Nhanga is a cultural innovation dealing with modern problems, and where girls candidly tackle subjects still sensitive in many conservative homes, said Nokutenda Magama, a programs officer with Rozaria Memorial Trust, a nonprofit that works to empower rural girls and women and is behind the Nhanga revival.\n\nSessions include practical skills like poultry raising, farming and soap making.\n\nThe trust organizes gatherings by age group, from girls as young as five to women over 35, ensuring an age-appropriate curriculum and mentorship across generations. Elders, including senior government officials, are sometimes invited.\n\nThe reinvention comes against worrying statistics. One in three girls in Zimbabwe marries before 18, according to the United Nations Childrens Fund, calling it a national emergency demanding urgent action. Its a similar situation across East and southern Africa. Child marriage rates soar to above 40% in central and West Africa, with Niger, at 76%, the highest globally, according to UNICEF.\n\nZimbabwe and many other African countrieshave outlawed child marriage, evenoverturning laws prohibiting abortion for girls under 18, but poverty, lethargic enforcement and cultural and religious customs keep it alive.\n\nFor Samantha Chidodo, the revival offered a path back. Now 26 and a final-year law student, she was forced into an abusive marriage at 17 to a man nearly a decade older.\n\nAll I wanted was to play and think of my future. Suddenly I had to be a mother and wife, she said at a camp that blended tent sessions with a girls and goals soccer tournament.\n\nI didnt even know what to do. I would be dead asleep, oblivious that I needed to breastfeed. A woman next door would take the crying baby, feed him and return him to the sleeping teen mother, she recalled.\n\nAfter two years, she walked away, enduring stigma as neighbors warned others not to associate with her. With support from Rozaria Memorial Trust, she returned to school and became one of the modern Nhanga pioneers.\n\nInitially we were only about 20 girls. Almost 90% of us did well, some went to college, others started projects. The community began to see our power, and encouraged their children to join, she said. Nhanga is now seen as cool.\n\nToday, more than 200 girls in her village participate. Many schools across Zimbabwe have adopted the model, which has spread to Zambia and Sierra Leone and reached African Union and United Nations forums.\n\nBecause child marriage is often rooted in culture and religion, girls sought the backing of chiefs and village heads  custodians of local customs.\n\nXmas Savanhu, a local village headman, said leaders now enforce rules against early marriage. Offenders must pay a cow as a fine held in trust by the chief for the girls education. This ensures she can return to school without financial worries, he said, noting that culprits are also reported to police. Chiefs also partner with NGOs to help young mothers resume their studies.\n\nDespite progress, poverty and entrenched attitudes persist, said Enet Tini, a teacher and girls mentor whose school adopted the model.\n\nShe welcomeda government policy allowing girls to return to school after giving birth, but noted parents are often reluctant. The gap that we have lies with the adults. They view pregnancy or child marriage as indiscipline so they think the girls should be punished, she said, highlighting the importance of girls-ledinitiatives to change attitudes among themselvesand the community.\n\nNyaradzai Gumbonzvanda, deputy executive director at U.N. Women and founder of the Rozaria Memorial Trust, called child marriage essentially rape and sexual exploitation and a worldwide problem, but much higher in Africa, where laws alone cannot end it.\n\nLaws are important  but it is critically essential to reach to the girls themselves, to do the shift in the social norms in our communities, said Gumbonzvanda, who started Rozaria Memorial Trust in 2007 in honor of her late mother, who was married at 13.\n\nHer message that solutions must involve girls themselves alongside policymakers and traditional leaders resonates with Razo, the young mentor.\n\nIf we can pressure each other into behaving badly, then we can also influence each other to act positively, Razo said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has hit back at his deputy Constantino Chiwenga, accusing him of incitement and treason in a fiery response to a corruption dossier presented to the politburo, a move that further exposes the deepening succession battle within Zanu PF.\n\nMnangagwa, through newly appointed Zanu PF Secretary for Legal Affairs Ziyambi Ziyambi, dismissed Chiwengas dossier, which bemoaned alleged party capture and internal rot, describing it as fundamentally flawed and evidence of ignorance of party procedures.\n\nIn light of the foregoing, the document is fundamentally flawed, and its averments lack merit. It is my considered opinion that the document should be disregarded due to its material shortcomings and lack of appreciation of Party procedures and the national Constitution.\n\nAt its core, the document advocates for the unlawful removal of a constitutionally elected President, which is palpably treasonous. The document not only undermines the President but also the economy and individuals who work hard to support the Party.\n\nOne wonders whether the placement under sanctions of some of these individuals was not a result of such reckless utterances. Such reckless utterances have cost our economy, His Excellencys goodwill in the international fora, and individuals who have been unduly placed under sanctions, and in the end, no investor would want to invest in our country, said Ziyambi.\n\nIn his dossier, Chiwenga reportedly expressed strong opposition to the partys resolution to extend Mnangagwas tenure beyond the constitutionally mandated two terms, arguing that such a move undermines both the Constitution and party unity.\n\nZiyambi countered the argument, saying Chiwengas stance reflected a lack of understanding of Zanu PFs internal processes.\n\nIndeed, the President is a constitutionalist who has not deviated from the Constitution at any time. However, if the people have spoken, should the President disregard the will of the people? The author is patently disregarding the resolutions, and seems unaware of the provisions of Article 6, Section 34, subsections (2) to (5) of the Party Constitution, which outline the powers and functions of the National Peoples Conference.\n\nThe above assertion could be a result of the authors ignorance of the quoted legal provisions. However, such ignorance may be excusable for non-legal persons. What is being referred to as the 2030 Agenda derives from the 2024 resolutions of the Conference. Given the underlying circumstances, any attempt to destabilise the Government on the basis of such falsehoods is tantamount to treason, said Ziyambi further.\n\nThe heated exchange comes as Zanu PF prepares for its National Peoples Conference in Mutare this week, expected to be dominated by growing tensions between Mnangagwa and his deputy.\n\nParty insiders say the conference could set the tone for a bruising internal power struggle as political lines have clearly been drawn.\n\n",

            "content": "By The Conversation\n\nCritical mineralssuch as lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper, rare earth elements, and platinum group metals are essential for modern technologies. They are key to industries ranging from electronics and telecommunications to renewable energy, defence, and aerospace systems.\n\nThe global demand for these minerals has been growing, as has the competition for them.\n\nThe supply and production of these minerals is largely concentrated in the global South. Most of the worlds cobalt is produced in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). It produces almostthree-quartersof the global cobalt output. Australia produces nearly half of the worlds lithium.Chile accounts for another quarter of global lithium production, with China following at 18%.\n\nChina dominates the supply chain through massive investments in mining operations, particularly in Africa.It is responsible for refining 90% of rare earth elements and graphite, and 60-70% of lithium and cobalt. The United States and European Union  long-term trading partners with African nations  have also adopted policies to secure access to Africas resources.\n\nThe question is what African countries are doing to take advantage of this demand for these critical minerals, especially to drive their own development.\n\nAs developmentresearcherswe address this question in aspecial publicationon the rising significance of critical minerals in Africa by theIndian Council of World Affairs. In anotherpublication, we look at how emerging resource diplomacy may reinforce Africas position in the global economy as a mere source of raw materials.\n\nWe recommend that African countries determine for themselves how to benefit from this global competition. This includes developing national strategies that emphasise local value addition and benefits. Also, national strategies should begin positioning African countries to gain from their resources beyond value addition.\n\nThe competition for Africas critical minerals underscores the urgency of governance reforms and regional cooperation to transform mineral wealth into sustainable prosperity, avoiding another resource curse.\n\nA Chinese-led New World Order is emerging to counter the US-led Western influence. Eastern and global South countries demonstrate this shift through groupings likeBRICSand South-South cooperation in technology and development. China has strengthened its influence in the global South through initiatives such as theBelt and Road Initiative.\n\nLaunched in 2013, the Belt and Road Initiative is an ambitious infrastructure project that connects continents by land and sea. Since then,over 200 agreementshave been signed with over 150 countries and 30 international organisations. The initiative has expanded Chinas access to resources. This is often in exchange forinfrastructure developmentthat links mining regions to ports.\n\nIn Africa, China has invested heavily in mining and infrastructure. Its firms have spent aboutUS$4.5 billionin lithium projects in Zimbabwe, the DRC, Mali, and Namibia. Chinas strategic focus includes resource-rich countries such as the DRC, Zimbabwe, Zambia, South Africa and Ghana.\n\nChina recentlymarked the 80th anniversaryof the end of World War II with a military parade. The parade projected Chinas military strength withPresident Xi warning that China is unstoppable.\n\nChina is emboldened by its influence and access to critical minerals. This has strengthened its ability to acquire military hardware and other advanced technologies.\n\nAfrica holds about 30% of the worlds critical mineral deposits, making it central to geopolitical contest. The US and EU have sought agreements to secure supplies and reduce reliance on China.\n\nThe EU hasstrategic partnershipson minerals with the DRC, Rwanda, Namibia and Zambia. China hasbilateral agreementswith eleven African countries in the mining sector. The US also has atrilateral agreementwith the DRC and Zambia. Its purpose is to support an integrated value chain for electric vehicle (EV) batteries. It also recently signed a Minerals for Peace deal with the DRC and Rwanda to help end decades of conflict in eastern Congo.\n\nAlthough African countries need support to turn their resources into prosperity, our research found that these partnerships risk reinforcing Africas marginal position in the global value chain. They often reproduce conditions reminiscent of colonialism: dependency, resource extraction, and power imbalances.\n\nOur research argues that the struggle between the US-led and Chinese-led world orders will hinge on a few things. One is control over emerging technologies. These include renewable energy, defence, aerospace, and AI  all of which depend on critical minerals. Expanded access to, and control of, these minerals and their supply chains will be a key determinant of global power.\n\nCompetition between the US and China for critical minerals will intensify. Yet it is crucial that African countries remain neutral. They must engage only in meaningful, mutually beneficial partnerships that genuinely advance their countries and its economies.\n\nAfrican countries must explicitly define their priorities in the extractives sector. Without clear strategies, external powers will continue to dictate Africas future. The continent will be locked into dependency rather than enabling it to capture real value from its mineral wealth.\n\nFinally, rather than just competing for Africas critical minerals, China, the US, and the EU should equitably engage with African countries in the extractives sector to ensure just development across the continent.\n\nLecturer in Sustainability and Fellow of Indo Pacific Research Centre, Murdoch University\n\nAssociate Professor, Development Studies, Murdoch University\n\nPostdoctoral Researcher, Universit di Torino\n\n",

When peers explain, the message sticks. These ambassadors know the slang, they know the platforms and they know the fears.\n\n Sister Shelly Majira, Kuwadzana Polyclinic\n\nCervical cancer is the most common cancer among women in the country, accounting for almost a third of all female cancer diagnoses, and its the single deadliest cancer in Zimbabweans of any sex. Its also preventable with a dose of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine  and thats a fact these young health ambassadors are trying to spotlight in WhatsApp groups and through community campaigns. Their work is reshaping health conversations, tackling stigma and ensuring that prevention is a priority for future generations.\n\nTapiwanashe Nyezana, 25, a youth health ambassador at Kuwadzana Polyclinic in the capital, Harare, speaks passionately about the importance of vaccinating young girls before they reach adulthood. I want to see children grow up healthy and capable of fulfilling their dreams. Good health is the foundation of a successful life, which motivated me to take on this role. I believe that young girls deserve the opportunity to be protected from cervical cancer through vaccination before they reach adulthood, she said.\n\nTapiwanashe Nyezana outside Kuwadzana Polyclinic.

We urge young girls and their parents to act promptly and ensure children have access to vaccines, because cervical cancer is preventable through vaccination, Nyezana said.\n\nBarbra Mangwiro, a vendor near Kuwadzana Polyclinic, previously believed vaccines had negative side-effects  after hearing deceptive rumours that they served hidden agendas. However, after receiving vaccine education from young health ambassadors and nurses, her perspective shifted.\n\nI used to think vaccines were harmful, but after learning about their importance, I allowed my children to be vaccinated at school when the Ministry of Health rolled out its vaccination programmes, she said. I encourage mothers to make sure their children, particularly girls, are vaccinated at an early age against cervical cancer because vaccines are important.\n\nBarbra Mangwiro a parent and a vendor near Kuwadzana Polyclinic.

Those targets stipulate that by the time they are 15 years old, 90% of girls should have received all recommended HPV vaccinations; by the time they are 35, and again 45 years old, 70% of women should have had a high-performance cervical cancer test; and 90% of women who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer or precancer should receive the proper care and treatment. WHO created the Elimination Planning Tool (EPT) to assist countries in meeting these goals based on the unique health needs of their populations.\n\nIn Zimbabwe youth ambassadors play a crucial role in translating this elimination strategy to the local level, according to the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Health and Child Care, Dr Aspect Maunganidze. Youth campaigners spread accurate information, address myths, and encourage early protection for girls aged 1014 years.\n\nLocal clinics are critical in our primary health care service delivery, and training youth advocates is fully aligned with our national HPV vaccination strategy, which aims to raise awareness, improve acceptance, and increase coverage.\n\nTheir efforts are essential as we work toward the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem, Dr Maunganidze said.\n\nDr. Aspect Maunganidze, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health and Child Care.

Dr Maunganidze explained, The single-dose schedule is equally effective as the two-dose schedule, easier to deliver, and improves coverage by reducing missed doses.\n\nIn Kuwadzana, a high-density suburb of Harare, health workers are tapping into the power of peer influence to boost HPV vaccination among young girls. According to Sister Shelly Majira of Kuwadzana Polyclinic, the suburb has a population of 103,198, which includes 34,778 children under the age of 15. Among them, 10,630 are girls aged 10 to 14  the target group for the HPV vaccine in Zimbabwe.\n\nSister Shelly Majira explains HPV at Kuwadzana Polyclinic.

These young peer educators are trained in basic health communication, myth-busting and digital advocacy. Sister Majira, who supervises the ambassadors, emphasises the value of empowering youth to lead.\n\nWe realised that when health workers visit schools, children listen but often forget. When peers explain, the message sticks. These ambassadors know the slang, they know the platforms and they know the fears, she explained.\n\nSister Majira notes that one of the major barriers to vaccination is parental misconceptions. Many parents mistakenly believe that the HPV vaccine is intended for family planning. This perception contributes to low walk-in numbers at clinics.\n\nFrom January to May, only seven to 17 girls per month came for HPV vaccination at the clinic. However, when we engaged in school outreach programs, we saw a remarkable increase118 vaccinated in June and 357 in July. This shows that vigorous outreach, supported by our youth ambassadors, is key to reaching more children, she said.\n\nMonica Mutuma, one of the youth health ambassadors, explained that their work focuses on engaging young girls, and educating them about the importance of early vaccination to protect against cervical cancer. We share information on staying protected, fight against misinformation, and encourage vaccination while its still early.\n\nI can confidently say that around 70% of people we interact with are welcoming us, which shows we are making headway against misinformation.\n\n Monica Mutuma, youth health ambassador\n\nHowever, the final decision usually rests with the parents. Some of them used to believe the vaccine is for family planning or that it could cause infertility, she said.\n\nDespite encountering challenges  including a shortage of resources for creating flyers and accessing tools for data collection  Mutuma is optimistic about the impact of peer-led education. We are grateful to Sister Majira and her team for equipping us with the knowledge and skills to respond to questions during our outreaches and at the clinic. I can confidently say that around 70% of people we interact with are welcoming us, which shows we are making headway against misinformation, she added.\n\nPushing back against misinformation means making strides towards a safer future. In July, ten-year-old Keila Mazarura came home and told her mother, Ido Togaresei, about an HPV vaccination session that would be taking place at the school. In times past, Togaresei said, misconceptions would have caused her to forbid her child from receiving the jab. But lately its grown easier to access the facts. I permitted her to get the dose, Togaresei toldVaccinesWork.She was so happy about it, because it is her health that matters.\n\nThis article was originally published onVaccines Work.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has dismissed a contempt of court application filed by former police officer Tatenda Shiri, who sought to have top police officials, including Commissioner-General Stephen Mutamba, jailed for allegedly defying a reinstatement order.\n\nJustice Fatima Maxwell sitting at the Harare High Court ruled that Shiris application was without merit, finding that the police bosses could not be held in contempt because they lacked the authority to reinstate him, and because the order he relied on was under legal challenge.\n\nFirst and second respondents do not have the authority to reinstate the applicant. They cannot be committed to civil imprisonment for failing to do an act which is beyond their mandates, said the judge.\n\nShiri, who once served under the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP), had been discharged after being convicted of violating the Police Act [Chapter 11:10].\n\nHe appealed his dismissal, arguing he was never given a fair hearing, and later won a default court order reinstating him to the force without loss of salary and benefits.\n\nHowever, despite the court order, the ZRP and the Police Service Commission allegedly failed to act, prompting Shiri to file for contempt, accusing the police leadership of being in wilful and mala fide defiance of a lawful order.\n\nThrough his lawyer Mugiya, Shiri argued that civil contempt is the wilful and mala fide refusal or failure to comply with a court order, insisting that the respondents were deliberately ignoring the judgment.\n\nBut the police, represented by F. Chimunoko from the Attorney Generals Office, opposed the bid, saidthe reinstatement order was a default judgment and had since been challenged through an application for rescission.\n\nIt is ill-advised for the applicant to seek to enforce an order which is being challenged, the police argued, warning that executing the order would impede justice if it is successfully rescinded.\n\nMaxwell agreed, noting that the pending rescission proceedings meant the police could not be said to have acted in bad faith.\n\nThe existence of a court case challenging the very order they are alleged to be in contempt of removes the mala fides. If their application for rescission fails and they still do not comply, then the respondents would indeed be acting wilfully and mala fide, he ruled.\n\nThe judge further said the contempt application was procedurally defective, as Shiri had failed to personally serve the respondents as required by law.\n\nShiri, who was dismissed following disciplinary proceedings within the police force, has been fighting to regain his job since last year.\n\nHis reinstatement order  granted in HCH 1269/24  remains suspended pending the outcome of the rescission applications filed by the ZRP and the Police Service Commission.\n\n",
