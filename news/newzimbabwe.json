Why is it so often the missing link between poor inspection outcomes and outstanding governance? And how can digital tools like ComplyPlus help organisations embed CPD into daily practice rather than scramble for certificates before inspections?\n\nIn this article,Dr Richard Duneexplores why CPD should be treated as a compliance function, not a side project  and how integrating it into digital compliance systems, governance frameworks, and workforce planning can drive measurable improvements in care quality, safety, and leadership effectiveness.\n\nContinuing professional development (CPD) is the ongoing process of building and maintaining the knowledge, skills, and behaviours required to deliver safe, effective, person-centred care or learning support.\n\nIts not a single training session or a course to tick off before revalidation. True CPD is structured, continuous, evidence-based, and strategic.\n\nThe following are the core components of CPD:\n\nIn practical terms, CPD is how providers ensure their staff are competent, confident, and compliant, not just when inspectors arrive, but every day.\n\nHealth and social care operate in a fast-changing environment: new treatments, new legislation, and emerging technologies are constantly reshaping how care and education are delivered.\n\nWithout regular, relevant training, staff quickly fall behind, placing organisations at risk of:\n\nAcross England and other regulated jurisdictions, CPD is not optional. Its embedded in multiple laws, standards, and frameworks.\n\nThe following are the key laws, inspection standards, and professional body requirements that make continuing professional development a legal and regulatory necessity:\n\nIn regulated environments, incomplete or disorganised CPD records are one of the most common reasons for enforcement action or inspection failure.\n\nAfter a recent episode of ourComplyPlus Presentspodcast, many providers asked: What counts as legitimate CPD? The answer is simpler than you think:\n\nIf an activity is relevant to your role, has learning outcomes, is evidenced, and reflected on  it counts.\n\nBelow are some of the valid CPD activities that are accepted by regulatory and professional bodies:\n\nThe following activities do not count as valid CPD activities:\n\nWhen CPD is approached strategically, it fits into a wider governance and compliance cycle, monitored through atraining management system(TMS) or other regulatory compliance software.\n\nThe following are the six-step CPD governance process:\n\nWhen tracked digitally, this process becomes seamless, transparent, and inspection-ready.\n\nGone are the days of filing cabinets and spreadsheet trackers.

            "content": "By Kudzai Tamary Chikiwa | Global Voices\n\nZimbabwes public debt servicing crisis has had far-reaching consequences for the countrys healthcare system. With a significant portion of thenational budgetdedicated to debt repayment, the healthcare sector has been left underfunded and understaffed. This has resulted in a shortage of critical equipment, medicines, and healthcare personnel, ultimately affecting the quality of care provided to patients.The story of Memory Ncube, a Zimbabwean motherand her baby, Tendai, is a tragic illustration of the human cost of this crisis.\n\nIn the quiet moments, Memorys mind wanders back to the day her world shattered. Her preterm baby girl, Tendai, had been fighting for her life, struggling with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). In a bid to save the new life, Memory was transferred from rural Zvishavane district hospital toMpilo Central HospitalinBulawayo, Zimbabwes second-largest city. This was not because the doctors in Zvishavane were incompetent, but because they lacked the necessary equipment, including a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine.\n\nFull of hope that her child would make it, Memory traveled 185 kilometers (114.954 miles) toMpilo Central Hospital, which is one of the referral hospitals for patients from the Southern region of Zimbabwe. Recently, the hospital received a lifeline in the form of a donation from theHigherlife Foundation, which provided critical equipment, including CPAP machines, suction machines, monitors, jaundice meters, and phototherapy machines. Prior to this donation, the hospital had been grappling with a shortage of equipment, often resulting in premature deaths of patients.\n\nHowever, tragically for this family, when she arrived at the hospital, it was too late, and her daughter had died. She sobbingly recalled her babys death:\n\nMy heart breaks when I think of what happened to my daughter. If only there was equipment at the hospital, I was not going to travel all this way with a critical baby. I wish the government knew the devastating impact of not servicing public hospitals.\n\nZimbabwes public debt servicing has become a suffocating burden, squeezing the life out of the healthcare system. Witha total public debt of approximately USD 21.53 billion, with much of it owed to the World Bank, China, France, and other international creditors, the governments debt repayment obligations are consuming a significant chunk of the national budget. In the 2025 budget, theMinistry of Health and Child Carewas allocated ZWD 27.8 billion (approximately USD 1.039 billion), just 7.1 percent of public spending, which falls short of theAbuja Declarations 15 percent allocation target.\n\nTheAbuja Declarationis a commitment made byAfrican Unionmember states, including Zimbabwe, in 2001 to allocate at least 15 percent of their national budgets to improve the healthcare system.\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncube has defended the move, saying,\n\nWe need to go through some period of austerity, but the same builds us towards prosperity.\n\nHowever, for Memory and countless other mothers, the prosperity promised seems a distant dream. Memorys baby is just one of many newborns who die before they reach one month in Zimbabwe. The neonatal mortality rate in Zimbabwe stands at37 deaths per 1,000 live births, a grim statistic that reflects the human cost of inadequate healthcare funding.\n\nCommunity Working Group on Health ZimbabweExecutive Director Itai Rusike concurred that the health sector remains distressed due to public debt servicing. He explained:\n\nShortages in healthcare personnel, inadequate infrastructure, high disease burden, and expensive specialist services continue to affect service delivery. These systemic issues are compounded by low public spending on health and weak financial protection mechanisms. Unfortunately, its the poor who suffer the most.\n\nHe emphasised the need for increased investment in building a robust and accessible health system, particularly in rural areas. He noted:\n\nAchieving universal health coverage requires strong public funding and a commitment to treating healthcare as a fundamental right.\n\nTo challenge economic injustice and notorious austerity measures, organizations like theEconomic Justice for Women Projectare educating women on public finances. The project aims to empower women with knowledge about public debt and its impact on service delivery, enabling them to advocate for change. Director Margaret Mutsamvi said:\n\nIssues to do with public debt seem complicated and elitist, but we are now going down to communities to educate them. We take time to explain to them the nexus between public debt servicing and service delivery. This can help them challenge the status quo from an informed perspective.\n\nMutsamvi reiterated that when a government introduces austerity measures in favor of public debt servicing, its the ordinary citizens who suffer.\n\nRight now, our health system is in shambles because a huge chunk of money is put towards clearing external and internal debt. The ordinary people suffer; this is why we have a high neonatal mortality rate in Zimbabwe. Women are the most affected, as they bear the brunt of austerity measures.\n\nShe added:\n\nWhen the government is prioritising public debt servicing it affects public hospitals. This is why there is a rise of privatisation of health facilities, mushrooming of private hospitals, clinics and pharmacies. Sometimes we have seen cases where there are no painkillers in hospitals and its even worse in rural areas. When the government is not funding, Its a woman who is paying for it.\n\nShe continued:\n\nWomen bear the pain of losing a child, caring for the sick at home and going through all the emotional stress. This is unpaid carework.\n\nThe story of Memory and her baby, Tendai, is a heartbreaking reminder of the human cost of Zimbabwes debt crisis. It is a call to action for policymakers to prioritize the health and well-being of the nations most vulnerable citizens.\n\n",
