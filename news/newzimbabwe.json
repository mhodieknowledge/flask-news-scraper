            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nAMALGAMATED Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) has vowed to fight government over what it terms illegal elevation of the retirement age.\n\nARTUZ president, Obert Masaraure said his organisation will not sit and relax whilst civil servants rights are trampled upon by President Emmerson Mnangagwas administration.\n\nThe elevation of the retirement age of civil servants is illegal on the front of the right to collective bargaining.\n\nIf you go through the Constitution of Zimbabwe, particularly Section 203 (i) (b), states that the conditions of service shall be fixed by the Commission but following through what is set out in Section 65 (v) were the right to bargaining so where a retirement age is part of the whole retirement package for the civil servants.\n\nThis cannot be unilaterally fixed by a bunch of people from the employers side wherever they meet in Cabinet or wherever they meet, we do not care, Masaraure said.\n\nHe added: As long as they have not engaged the employee side to then say, what is rational of this particular change, we find such a change both inappropriate and illegal.\n\nThat is why we are up against it.\n\nGovernment recently extended the retirement age from 45 years to 55 for police officers whilst the military will be allowed to retire at 65 from 50 with an allowance to get to 70 years.\n\nwe understand that the ruling elites are locked in power tussles. We however have a responsibility to fight for labour justice and right to education. Our responsibilities will not be shelved to allow factions of the ruling elites to settle their power issues. We will continue with the fight demanding urgent solutions to the questions of the day.\n\nWe are getting ready to push back against underpayment and the illegal elevation of the retirement age, Masaraure wrote on social media.\n\nDuring an interview with NewZimbabwe.com this Wednesday, Masaraure argued that factionalism had taken centre stage in the ruling Zanu PF party causing destructive decisions which do not take into consideration youths, who are supposed to be given a chance to occupy the few available jobs in the country.\n\nMost young graduates are unemployed as government amid government failure to create jobs for those churned out of universities and colleges yearly.\n\nWe look at the rate of unemployment of our young people and realise that this government cannot create jobs.\n\nWhy then do they want to keep old people occupying the little jobs that are there in the Republic, Masaraure queried.\n\nThere are issues to do with mental capacity of the person to say as we grow old, we get incapacitated. So why are we not giving the best brains; young people who are fresh graduates an opportunity to provide services to the people of Zimbabwe?\n\nWe need to build a strong State bureaucracy and that needs competent people who are highly energetic and young, but if we are going to be retaining our old friends in the interest of power retention, we are sabotaging the agenda of national development and unfortunately this is the path that has been chosen by the regime.\n\nWe will be protesting against it and rejecting it, and it will be reversed, Masaraure vowed.\n\nFundamentals such as the life expectancy of Zimbabweans which is now below 60 are some of the issues to include when a government changes laws or policies, said the trade unionist.\n\n",

            "content": "By Agencies\n\nJOSEF Fritzl has demanded a house with a basement if he is released from prison, as he continues to pursue an early release from prison.\n\nFritzl, 89, is demanding a house with a basement if he wins his freedom, as his lawyers try to use his dementia as a reason to secure his early release from prison.\n\nThe convicted rapist infamously fathered seven children with his daughter Elisabeth over 24 years, while entrapping her as a sex slave for 24 years in the basement of their Austria family home.\n\nSince he was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2009 he has been held in high-security psychiatric detention at Stein prison.\n\nBut because of his dementia, doctors might declare Austrias most famous prisoners unfit for imprisonment next year.\n\nHis lawyer, Astrid Wagner, told German press that every day he dreams of having his own house or apartment.\n\nMs Wagner told the Heute talk show that Fritzl doesnt care where exactly his life will be outside, though last year the criminal said he wanted to move to the UK and roam the highlands of Scotland.\n\nMs Wagner added that the 89-year-old no longer feels confident driving after so many years without practice, so he wants to live near a train connection.\n\nBut the main thing the rapist demanded was that the apartment or house must have a basement.\n\nThe eerie demand, considering that he imprisoned his daughter in a basement for 24 years, is apparently so he can store his files and documents.\n\nYou know, I have so many files, documents and memories, Fritzl said.\n\nIn fact, his cell is currently piled high with many folders and boxes filled with papers.\n\nLast year, public officials in Krems, a town West of Austrian capital Vienna, confirmed Fritzl will be placed under guardianship due to his declining mental state.\n\nThis means the court will appoint someone to make decisions on Fritzls behalf after he has been deemed unable to make them on his own.\n\nBut Fritzls lawyer, Astrid Wagner, informed Austrian media that she would be fighting the process as she considers the appointment of an adult to manage his affairs as not tenable  on the basis that he has no business to attend to and does not own any property.\n\nWagner says there is no necessity nor justification for appointing an adult representative, despite the fact Fritzl has beginning dementia and delusional episodes.\n\nFritzl has been transferred from Steins correctional facility to a cell in the normal prison following a decision by a three-member panel in the Krems Regional Court.\n\nBut the sex-offender pensioner was denied a general conditional release from normal prison in mid-May, with authorities deeming it not possible for special preventive reasons.\n\nThey said that future freedom from crime cannot be guaranteed due to the unprecedented criminal energy in connection with the convicted crimes.\n\nFritzl reportedly plans to move to the UK if he is ever released from prison.\n\nWhen I get released, it is not Austria I want to stay [in], rather I want to emigrate to the UK. Above all I want to roam free on the wild Highlands of Scotland, he said according to the Sun.\n\nFor me the lush green fields of Wales are also very, very appealing, but the main thing is its to the United Kingdom I am headed.\n\nFritzls crimes involved rape, coercion and imprisonment, keeping his daughter and her children trapped in a basement for years as he raped her thousands of times.\n\nElisabeth was abused from the age of 11, and was locked in the cellar from the age of 18 until she was 42.\n\n",

But as a sitting head of intelligence, he was untouchableuntil now, said Matinyarare.\n\nThis removal is proof that President Mnangagwa is armed with enough intelligence to act decisively against those working against the nation of Zimbabwe.\n\nIt signals the beginning of a critical cleanup within our security apparatus.\n\nNo reasons were given for Moyos removal as head of the dreaded CIO in Chief Secretary to the President and Cabinet Martin Rushwayas statement, however.\n\nMatinyarare, who has numerous defamation cases before Zimbabwean and South African courts, proceeded to accuse Moyo of fighting the Zimbabwe Anti-Sanctions Movement (ZASM)s efforts to fight for the removal of restrictive measures imposed on local individuals and companies.\n\nMatinyarare leads the ZASM in his capacity as chairperson.\n\nThe greatest opposition to our anti-sanctions and anti-GMO campaigns came not from foreign enemies, but from the very institution that should have been our greatest allythe CIO, said Matinyarare.\n\nNonetheless, despite this betrayal, we found critical support from counter-forces within the system who defied the DGs orders and followed higher orders to help us fight for Zimbabwe.\n\nA few of those who initially stood with us in the fight against sanctions, were later turned against us in the anti-GMO fight, as they aligned themselves with smugglers of toxic GMOs, forex externalisers, and economic saboteurs on the instruction of Moyo and his inner circle.\n\nRumour has it that the DG and his close personal circle had been put on a hefty retainer by some of the GMO smugglers to destroy me, for daring to fight against their smuggling and forex externalisation operations.\n\nNow that Moyo is gone, we hope the President clears out the remaining elements of his corrupt regimethose on foreign payrolls, those on the payrolls of those sabotaging our economy, our currency, and the Presidents agenda to rebuild Zimbabwe.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/president-carters-legacy-in-zimbabwe/",
            "content": "By Pamela Tremont, U.S. Ambassador to Zimbabwe\n\nU.S. President Jimmy Carters commitment to health, human rights, and peace worldwide will feature during his funeral proceedings in Washington, D.C. today. Eulogies from President Joe Biden and others will extoll Carters achievements both during his four years in the White House and his 44 years of philanthropy that followed. Carter, the longest-living of any U.S. president, was a ubiquitous, positive presence in our world for nearly half a century  building homes for the poor, monitoring elections around the globe, delivering humanitarian relief to those in need  often with his wife of 77 years, Rosalynn, by his side.\n\nThose are the familiar themes that will be beamed from the Washington National Cathedral around the globe today.\n\nHere in Zimbabwe, the story is more personal. As Carter would recall years later, What most people dont realize is, I spent more time on Zimbabwe than I did the Middle East. Historian Andrew DeRoche describes how Carter directed his future UN Ambassador, Andrew Young, on Inauguration Day to go to Africa and get some sense of what African leadership expected. Nearly four years later, President Carter would hear directly from Robert Mugabe himself when he visited the White House. The new Prime Minister of independent Zimbabwe appreciated the people of the United States who in our hour of need came to our support and thanked President Carter who stood firm on a matter of principle.\n\nPresident Carters principled leadership is the legacy he leaves for us. As President Carter said, during Prime Minister Mugabes visit to the White House, Today we stand with Zimbabwes efforts toward economic development and toward stability in your own country and the realization of the legitimate hopes and dreams of the people whom you lead. Those words are as true today as they were 45 years ago.\n\nOur commitment today to Zimbabwes economic development is rooted in President Carters principled leadership on human dignity. It is part of why last year we graduated more than 100 women from the Embassys Academy for Women Entrepreneurs, whose Zimbabwe alumnae now number more than 500 strong. These businesswomen, who own companies in security, agriculture, mining, and financial services  to name just a few  join a global network of entrepreneurs with increased knowledge and access to scale their successful ventures. Likewise, USAIDs Feed the Future programs trained nearly 3,200 young farmers last year to commercialize their farming businesses. On average, they tripled their annual incomes. The peanut farmer from Plains, Georgia turned president would be proud.\n\nThe legacy of President Carters principled leadership in public health contributes to Zimbabwes stability. His foundation  The Carter Center  championed the near elimination of the guinea worm disease, which afflicted 3.5 million people across 21 countries in 1986 but was reduced to just over a dozen cases in 2023. In that same spirit, we work every day with Zimbabwean partners on issues of clean water and sanitation. The United States continues to support Zimbabwe to strengthen water quality monitoring systems to prevent cholera outbreaks. In 2024, USAID helped improve water access for more than 97,000 people and nearly 37,000 livestock. Likewise, as The Carter Center battles malaria in Haiti and the Dominican Republic, U.S. initiatives through USAID and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention helped reduce the incidence of malaria in Zimbabwe by 40 percent in the last 15 years. Support from the American people makes available 800,000 mosquito nets, 1.2 million malaria rapid test kits, and nearly 100,000 life-saving antimalarial medications as our teams on the ground train health care workers and educate communities about malaria prevention and early treatment.\n\nFinally, President Carter believed in the hopes and dreams of the people of Zimbabwe. His elevation of human rights as a foreign policy priority of the United States demonstrated his view that might did not make right. He believed, as we do, that countries that respect human rights are more stable, more secure, and more peaceful. In the economic sphere, President Carter signed into law the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act that, to this day, remains a cornerstone in the global fight against corruption. He campaigned on the need for legislation to prohibit corporate bribery, which is both ethically repugnant and competitively unnecessary, erodes public confidence, and harms our relations with other countries. His support for Historically Black Colleges and Universities in the United States helped those institutions strengthen their academics, infrastructure, and research. Our EducationUSA and consular officers celebrate that legacy as we facilitate study and exchange in the United States for thousands of young Zimbabweans today and develop partnerships between institutions of higher learning in our two countries.\n\nJimmy Carters principled leadership and legacy encourage us all to think about how we can contribute to our communities and embody the idea that one principled person can make a positive change. As the first U.S. president to visit Sub-Saharan Africa and the only to visit Zimbabwe in his many trips to the continent post presidency, Jimmy Carter and his principles will continue to inspire our partnership with the people of Zimbabwe.\n\n",
