It is a serious initiative that will be supported by the ZRP.\n\nGovernment efforts to rid the CBD of illegal vendors and dirt, Operation Chenesa Harare, have failed to deal with the problem, compounded by Zimbabwes high unemployment rate.\n\nGraduates are part of those selling food stuffs, clothes, vegetables, fruits and second-hand clothes on the streets of Harare as job opportunities continue to get scarce.\n\nThey are constantly fleeing from marauding council vehicles, which confiscate their wares and arrest them. These vehicles operate with impunity, disobeying all traffic laws to arrest elderly women selling tomatoes and young boys selling sweets.\n\nAttempts to clean up Harare go back as far as Operation Murambatsvina in the early 2000s, with numerous more in between then and 2024.\n\nLast year, health services director Prosper Chonzi confessed that the Harare City Council had failed to deal with illegal vending because of the state of Zimbabwes economy.\n\nThe general economy is playing against us; we have been playing hide and seek after vendors, and it is not working, said Chonzi.\n\nI am not happy with the vending situation in the city. It is plain against what we are trying to achieve.\n\n",

Under this project, 650,000 prepaid water meters will be installed in major cities.\n\nThe residents associations pointed out that since the initial prepaid water metering project in Harare was unsuccessful, there is growing uncertainty over whether the true aim of privatisation is to improve water services or to benefit politically connected individuals.\n\nThis raises more questions than answers, leaving uncertainty about whether the goal is to create opportunities for politically connected individuals or to genuinely improve water services.\n\nWe emphasize that installing prepaid water meters will not address the root governance issues that have long undermined water service delivery in Harare.\n\nFundamental problems of transparency and accountability within both the City of Harare and the central government must be resolved first.\n\nThis forced privatisation of water services poses significant public health risks and endangers human lives, the statement added.\n\nThe associations also accused Harare Mayor Jacob Mafume of pushing for a water services takeover without citizen input or full council approval.\n\nRegrettably, rather than engaging in a consultative process, the Harare Mayor has taken a leading role in facilitating the takeover of water services without involving citizens or securing full council resolutions.\n\nThe residents associations further warned that water privatisation will ultimately fail, wasting public funds and putting residents health at risk.\n\n",

            "content": "TimesLive\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa has slammed Afrikaner-interest lobby groups AfriForum and Solidarity as unpatriotic for instigating the diplomatic rift between Pretoria and Washington through fearmongering over South Africas expropriation law.\n\nHowever, he said, whether their actions amounted to treason was best left to law enforcement to decide.\n\nRamaphosa was replying to questions from MPs in parliament on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nHis remarks come as the US has taken multiple actions against South Africa including cutting funding from the Presidents Emergency Plan for Aids Relief (Pepfar) and key officials such as US state secretary Marco Rubio snubbing South Africas G20 events.\n\nANC MP Lufefe Mkutu asked Ramaphosa for his views on AfriForum and Solidaritys attempt to hijack South Africas foreign policy and whether he agreed that the meddling by the organisations constituted treason.\n\nI have expressed my concern and my disappointment at what AfriForum and Solidarity have been doing in spreading misinformation about their own country in the US and I regard that as being unpatriotic, Ramaphosa replied. Because when you are a patriot of a country, the best you do is resolve the problems you have in the country rather than begin to damage the sovereignty of your country by running off to other countries and expecting them to take action against your own country.\n\nRamaphosa said he believed that the organisations instigated the action being taken against South Africa by the Trump administration.\n\nHe said this only sought to spread racist statements about South Africa when the country was focused on redressing past inequalities, but did not name it as treason.\n\nThe fact whether that it is treasonous or not is a matter that, obviously, our law enforcement agencies need to look at. The National Prosecuting Authority needs to look at that. But I take a dim view  in fact a very negative view  of what has ensued as they run around the world badmouthing their own country, putting their country into disrepute  by misinformation.\n\nRamaphosa said the US remained a strategic and historic partner to South Africa, which maintained its active engagements with the US through political, diplomatic and economic channels.\n\nAfter the election of President Trump in November last year, I had a telephone call with him to congratulate him and to reaffirm our commitment as SA to strengthening relations between our two countries.\n\nHe said South Africa will continue to engage the US to correct the mischaracterisation by AfriForum and Solidarity and restore ties between the nations through various channels. He expressed confidence that the diplomatic and political efforts at smoothing things over would succeed.\n\nWe have taken note of an executive order and recent statements by the current US administration about SA and aspects of our domestic and foreign policy. We have expressed concern about the mischaracterisation of the situation in our country and certain of our laws and policy positions.\n\nDA MP George Michalakis asked Ramaphosa what he would say to the car workers and farm workers who would lose jobs when Agoa [the African Growth and Opportunity Act] goes and South Africa can no longer participate in the preferential trade act of the US.\n\nRamaphosa replied saying a number of countries in Africa had been given the opportunity to participate in Agoa, had their participation withdrawn and have had to find ways in which they could enhance their exports.\n\nParticipation in Agoa is not at our behest. It is at the behest of the US and what we seek to do, and have done for many years, is to demonstrate that we are a good trading partner to the US and, indeed, to many countries around the world, he said.\n\nThere is going to be a review of the Agoa process and last year you might recall we held the Africa and US Agoa forum here in our own country and we were able  together with other African countries  to demonstrate that we do derive value from Agoa, but we also give value.\n\nWe export, but we also import from the US. So it is a two-way process as it is with many countries around the world. As it is now, we continue, not only in anticipation of an Agoa initiative, but we continue to expand our export market for a variety of goods around the world, Ramaphosa said.\n\nThe president said Deputy President Paul Mashatile was going to Japan with a ministerial delegation to open up more market space for South African goods in the east.\n\nSimilar visits are planned for the Middle East, Europe and China to foster similar ties.\n\nWe do not take the opportunity that we have, as it is called the African Growth Opportunity Act, lightly. But we also want to demonstrate that, yes, we also have value to add. When I spoke to President Trump  I informed him that we value participating in Agoa but I also informed him that we also sell critical minerals to the US and the relationship is fairly balanced.\n\n",
