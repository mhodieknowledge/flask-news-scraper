Response teams and local teams will work to find the people who may be infected and need to receive care, to ensure everyone is protected as quickly as possible,WHO added in a statement.\n\nDR Congo had a stockpile of treatments, including 2,000 doses of the Ervebo vaccine, effective to protect against this type of Ebola, the global health body said.\n\nThe last Ebola outbreak in DR Congo was three years ago, killing six people.\n\nAn outbreak in 2018-20 was far deadlier, claiming more than 2,000 lives.\n\nThe virus, which is thought to have originated in fruit bats, was first detected in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now DR Congo.\n\nPeople are infected when they have direct contact through broken skin, or the mouth and nose, with the blood, vomit, faeces or bodily fluids of someone with Ebola.\n\n",

General Assembly that begins Sept. 22, according to an internal State Department memo seen by The Associated Press.\n\nWhile the potential restrictions are still under consideration and the circumstances could change, the proposals would be another step in the Trump administrationscrackdown on visas, including a wide-ranging review of those already holding legal permissions to come to the U.S. and those seeking entry to head to the U.N. meeting.\n\nThe movements of Iranian diplomats are severely limited in New York, but one proposal being floated would bar them from shopping at big, members-only wholesale stores like Costco and Sams Club without first receiving the express permission of the State Department.\n\n",

His elder brother, Jonas Makhura, is facing charges of murder, attempted murder, and contravening the Immigration Act.\n\nThe younger sibling was arrested shortly after the attack, and police recovered the axe allegedly used in the crime. The elder brother was later tracked down in the Alldays policing area, allegedly attempting to flee the country.\n\nHe was found hiding inside a truck headed towards Zimbabwe and carrying a bag of clothes in an attempt to escape, Ledwaba said.\n\nBoth suspects appeared before the Senwabarwana Magistrates Court on Wednesday. They were remanded in custody until 15 September 2025, when the matter will be heard at the Maleboho Periodical Court.\n\nMeanwhile,Limpopos provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe,welcomed the swift arrest of the brothers and applauded community members for helping police track down the alleged killers.\n\nThis was a brutal act of violence.
