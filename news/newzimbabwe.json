My Government is committed to weeding out irresponsible mining stakeholders who cause pollution, environmental degradation, and damage to critical infrastructure.\n\nAs we welcome investors into our jurisdiction, we expect them to adhere to the Constitution and laws of our country, while also respecting our people, customs, and culture, he said.\n\nHowever, citizens have urged the government to make the Mines and Minerals Bill available in vernacular languages to ensure easier understanding and interpretation, especially within mining communities.\n\n",

It is the generational consensus that Tagwirei must make it because he is young, said Mliswa.\n\nWe have given our liberators time to liberate us from an economic point of view but they have not done what we expected them to do, they have done their best but it is about time that we took over.\n\nWe do not have liberation history but we have economic ability to be able to transform the country and equally transform its fortunes.\n\nMliswa, who was fired from Zanu PF in 2015, has emerged as one of Tagwireis fervent supporters, frequently laying into Chiwenga.\n\nChiwenga is pushing for Tagwireis arrest on a string of corruption allegations. His attempts to get the partys stamp, however, fell by the wayside as he was advised to report all of the alleged graft to Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) or the police.\n\nTagwireis meteoric rise is being supported by claims that he financed the 2017 coup that toppled late leader Robert Mugabe and governments agriculture programme, Command Agriculture.\n\nAdded Mliswa: It is a generational consensus which you cannot stop.\n\nThat is the reason why the opposition moved from the late Morgan Tsvangirai to Nelson Chamisa. Now Zanu PF has moved to Tagwirei.\n\n",

            "content": "Finance in Africa\n\nZimbabwe is among the two African nations  alongside Zambia  that are again absent from the Top 100 African Banks 2025 list, according to African Business Magazine.\n\nTheannual ranking, which measures banks financial strengthbased on Tier 1 Capital  the sum of a banks core equity, reserves, and retained earnings  features banks from 20 African countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo, Togo, Mozambique, Cte dIvoire, Angola, and Gabon.\n\nAccording to the London-based IC publication, Zimbabwes exclusion stems from years of economic shocks, hyperinflation, and currency instability that have eroded the balance sheets of local banks and diminished investor confidence.\n\nGrowth has been stronger since the COVID-19 pandemic, and the World Bank forecasts a 6% increase in GDP this year, so the countrys banks could re-enter our rankings if the economic environment continues to improve, African Business said. Sound government and governance will be key.\n\nDespite recent signs of recovery, Zimbabwes financial sector remains fragile. With a population of about 17 million, the country has faced some of the worlds highest inflation rates, a volatile exchange-rate regime, and frequent shifts in its monetary framework  from the launch of the ZiG (Zimbabwe Gold) currency in April 2024 to ongoing struggles with dollarisation.\n\nAlthough the World Bank classifies Zimbabwe as a lower-middle-income country, its economy continues to be constrained by policy inconsistencies, low foreign investment, and chronic power shortages.\n\nIn 2024, the Bank said GDP growth slowed to 1.7% largely due to drought-induced agricultural declines and energy supply disruptions.\n\nZimbabwe continues to be in debt distress, with high and unsustainable public debt that limits its access to international financing. Due to the accumulation of external arrears and legacy debts, total public debt reached $23.2 billion in 2024 (72.9% of GDP), the multilateral lender said in a recent report.\n\nThe country has been in non-accrual status to the World Bank since 2000 and is also in arrears to the African Development Bank and the European Investment Bank.\n\nBut last July, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube projected that growth would rebound to around six percent in 2025, supported by improved crop yields and stronger commodity prices. However, according to International Monetary Fund data, inflation remains above 30%, while access to credit is still limited.\n\nThese structural weaknesses have made it difficult for Zimbabwean banks to meet the capitalisation thresholds required to compete with their peers across the continent.\n\nIn contrast, Mauritius has positioned itself as one of Africas leading financial centres. The government, through the Mauritius International Financial Centre, is leveraging the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to facilitate cross-border trade and attract regional investment.\n\nThe Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) remains the largest nonSouth African lender, with Tier 1 capital of $1.5 billion, up from $1.4 billion last year. Six Mauritian banks are now ranked among Africas top 20. Angola and Mozambique each contributed three banks, while Namibia had two.\n\nMCB operates across Kenya, Madagascar, Mozambique, Seychelles, and South Africa, and has expanded internationally to Dubai, France, and the Maldives.\n\nIt has also embraced technology by adopting a unified Temenos banking platform and introducing AI-driven credit scoring to strengthen lending and manage non-performing loans.\n\nSouth Africas financial giants once again dominate the Southern African rankings, occupying the top six positions. Despite the rise of digital-first banks, none have yet broken into the regional top 20.\n\nStandard Bank remains the largest lender in Africa, while Absa Bank recorded the highest growth in Tier 1 capital, rising from $4.7 billion in 2024 to $5.6 billion in 2025.\n\nThe combined capital of the top 20 banks in Southern Africa climbed from $37.4 billion to $40.4 billion over the past year, though growth was largely concentrated among the biggest players.\n\nIn West and Central Africa, total Tier 1 capital fell from $15.6 billion to $14.9 billion as lenders grappled with macroeconomic headwinds. Nigeria still dominates the region with 12 banks on the list, followed by Cte dIvoire (3), Ghana (2), and one each from Togo, Gabon, and the DRC.\n\nAccess Bank has overtaken FirstBank and now trails Zenith Bank, which ranks as the biggest lender in the region. Ecobank Transnational remains the largest non-Nigerian bank, followed by BGFI Gabon, whose Tier 1 capital surged to $1.3 billion from $844 million in 2024.\n\nAfrican Business noted that Nigerias banking sector continues to evolve through waves of consolidation driven by the Central Bank of Nigerias new capital requirements.\n\nIn March 2024, the CBN raised minimum capital thresholds to 500 billion ($333 million) for international banks, 200 billion ($134 million) for national banks, and 50 billion ($33 million) for regional and merchant banks.\n\nNorth Africa remains the continents most financially robust region, led by Egypt and Morocco.\n\nEgypts National Bank of Egypt tops the regional table with $7.3 billion in Tier 1 capital, followed by Moroccos Attijariwafa Bank ($6.2 billion), Banque Centrale Populaire ($5.2 billion), and Egypts Banque Misr ($4.8 billion).\n\nMoroccan banks continue to benefit from early expansion into sub-Saharan Africa, boosting profits and cross-border connections. BCP, which operates in 32 countries (18 in Africa), reported a 16.8% increase in half-year profit to 3.5 billion dirhams ($386 million) in 2025.\n\nKenya continues to drive East Africas banking growth, led by Equity Bank ($1.9 billion), KCB Group ($1.7 billion), and Co-operative Bank of Kenya ($927 million)  all ranking among the fastest-growing institutions by Tier 1 capital.\n\nEthiopia isalso emerging as a rising player, with six banks now in the East African top 20, following banking-sector liberalisation. The countrys rapid 9% annual economic growth and large population of 135 million position it for further expansion as deregulation opens space for domestic and foreign lenders.\n\n",
