            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFormer Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) leader Nelson Chamisa said he will not participate in the 17 October planned protests against President Emmerson Mnangagwas government.\n\nThis decision, he explains, stems from the oppositions experience with the November 2017 military takeover. He says their involvement then served as a salutary lesson, teaching them not to become entangled in Zanu-PFs internal factional and succession battles.\n\nThis follows a call from ousted Zanu-PF Central Committee member Blessed Runesu Geza for a one-million-man march on Friday, aimed at protesting against Mnangagwa and his alleged corrupt cartel. Gezas accusations target a number of high-profile figures, including controversial business tycoons such as Wicknell Chivayo, Geo Pomona CEO Delish Nguwaya, Paul Tungwarara, and Kudakwashe Tagwirei.\n\nHowever, analysts suggest that the planned protest goes beyond mere accusations of corruption but points to a deeper succession war playing out between Mnangagwas faction and his deputy, Rtd General Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nChiwenga is the favourite to take over from Mnangagwa, with many believing he has been patiently waiting for his turn. Yet, his path is reportedly being obstructed by Mnangagwa loyalists, who are now calling for the incumbent to extend his term of office beyond the constitutional limit of two terms.\n\nThis echoes the experience of the opposition previously, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), as it was then known, which took to the streets in a protest that ousted former President Robert Mugabe from power, anticipating a role in a new government.\n\nThat hope proved to be short-lived. The MDC felt betrayed and used, having been abandoned by Zanu-PF and Mnangagwa himself shortly after Mugabes departure.\n\nResponding directly to calls for him and his supporters to join Fridays protests in Harare, Chamisa wrote, 2017 taught us a big lesson!.\n\nHe added that the root cause of the countrys problems lies in disputed elections, maintaining that until this issue is addressed, Zimbabwe will remain trapped in its socioeconomic and political challenges.\n\nIgnoring the 2023 stolen election is ignoring the root of our crisis. Anything that does not address the 2023 stolen election is a fraud and a waste of time. Corruption, capture, suffering  theyre symptoms of a disputed mandate and a contested government. Lets treat the cause, not the symptoms, Chamisa wrote on his X account Monday.\n\nChamisa still commands a considerable following among opposition supporters despite his resignation from the CCC in January 2024, which left the opposition in further disarray.\n\n",

With so much focus on his fashion, its easy to wonder: Is he a music artist or a fashion icon?\n\nBut his artistry and influence suggest hes more than capable of balancing both worlds  and now, with Vuka up for Grammy consideration, the spotlight may finally shift toward his musical achievements.\n\nFor being on the list of the artists considered, Oscar responded, Thank you to everyone who keeps on streaming the music, attending shows, and getting merch, youre appreciated.\n\nOscars journey into music wasnt part of the original plan. After matriculating, his parents offered him a choice: a new car or R100,000 in cash. He chose the money and used it to invest in DJ equipment. With his entrepreneurial parents full support  and encouragement to pursue formal education  he began his career, carefully tracking every cent spent. Their belief in his vision laid the foundation for his success, and he remains deeply grateful for it.\n\nBeyond the decks and designer fits, Oscar is also a devoted family man. In a recent podcast, he opened up about his love for his family and his role as a father.\n\nI just want to keep inspiring the youth, guiding them, and helping them avoid the mistakes we made, he shared, looking forward to the next chapter of his journey.\n\nOscar Mbo is also the founder and lead voice behind The Ashmed Hour, a popular entertainment podcast that blends music and thoughtful conversation  showcasing not only his talent but his depth as a creative.\n\nNow, with Vuka being considered for a Grammy,Oscar Mbostands at the edge of a new era.

A group of military personnel and politicians planned to assassinate me.\n\nI was forced to find a safe place to protect my life.\n\nThere is only one way to resolve these issues; that is to respect the constitution in force in the country.\n\nAFP via Getty Images Young people spearheaded nationwide rallies demanding a fairer deal for citizens\n\nOver the weekend, CAPSAT, a powerful army unit that helped install Rajoelina into power in 2009 moved to undermine him by declaring itself in command of all the armed forces, while some of its officers joined protesters on the streets of the capital, Antananarivo.\n\nFollowing a meeting of military commanders on Monday, the new Chief of Army Staff installed by CAPSAT, Gen Demosthene Pikulas, assured the public that the security forces were working together to maintain order in the island nation.\n\nBy Monday evening, the general was at state TV headquarters trying to resolve the crisis, according to a statement from the presidency.\n\nSpeaking on condition of anonymity, a senior leader in Madagascars largest opposition party, TIM, told the BBC that Madagascar was now effectively being run by the army unit.\n\nThe TIM party has also said that it plans to bring impeachment proceedings against Rajoelina for abandonment of post.\n\nSeveral of Rajoelinas inner circle have fled to nearby Mauritius. They include former Prime Minister President Richard Ravalomanana and the businessman Maminiaina Ravatomanga.\n\nDespite its abundant natural resources, Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world. About 75% of people there live below the poverty line, the World Bank says, while data from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) shows just over one-third of people have access to electricity.\n\nThe protests began over anger with repeated water and power cuts, then escalated to reflect wider dissatisfaction with Rajoelinas government over high unemployment, corruption and the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nAt least 22 people were killed and more than 100 injured in the first few days of the protests, according to the UN, although the government has rejected these figures.\n\nEyewitnesses describe security officers opening fire on protesters with live ammunition. In one case,a newborn baby diedfrom smoke inhalation after being exposed to tear gas.\n\nMadagascar has been rocked by multiple uprisings since it gained independence in 1960, including mass protests in 2009 that forced then-President Marc Ravalomanana to step down and saw Rajoelina ushered into office.\n\nAged just 34 at the time, Rajoelina became Africas youngest leader  going on to govern for four years, then returning to power again after the 2018 election.\n\nRajoelina was born into wealth and, before entering politics, had made a name for himself as an entrepreneur and DJ  setting up a radio station and an advertising company along the way.\n\nBut his sharp-suited, baby-faced appeal soon waned, as allegations of cronyism and entrenched corruption became unshakeable.\n\n",

An order that there shall be no order as to costs is appropriate in the circumstances, Justice Deme ruled.\n\nDr Saidi remains barred from practising general medicine and must first lodge an appeal through the Health Professions Authority before seeking constitutional redress.\n\n",

Walter Musona, Bill Antonio, Emmanuel Jalai, and Brendon Galloway also returned to the starting eleven.\n\nThe first half offered little excitement, with both sides struggling to create clear chances. Zimbabwe suffered an early setback when Gerald Takwara was forced off with a head injury, replaced by Godknows Murwira.\n\nIn the second half, Nees introduced Nakamba for Fabisch, followed by Khama Billiat and Daniel Msendami for Walter Musona and Tawanda Chirewa, respectively.\n\nMsendami nearly made an impact in the 88th minute but missed a golden opportunity to put the Warriors ahead. Lesotho capitalised deep into stoppage time when Hlompo Kalake fired past Chipezeze in the 93rd minute to seal victory.\n\nThe defeat piles more pressure on Nees, who has managed just two wins, both against Namibia, since his appointment in July.\n\n",
