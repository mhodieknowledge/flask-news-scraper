            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZanu PFs internal power struggles have escalated dramatically, with party spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa publicly rebuking Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, accusing him of turning the presidium into a kangaroo court.\n\nThe confrontation reportedly followed Chiwengas demand for President Emmerson Mnangagwa to take action against individuals named in a corruption dossier he presented to the Politburo.\n\nSources told NewZimbabwe.com tensions were high during the meeting. Chiwengas allies initially rallied behind him before retreating when questions were raised about the motives behind his dossier.\n\nThe document reportedly implicates several prominent businessmen closely associated with Mnangagwa, including Wicknell Chivayo, Delish Nguwaya, Kudakwashe Tagwirei, Pedzai Sakupwanya, and Paul Tungwarara.\n\nThe group is accused of siphoning millions from state coffers, calling for their immediate arrest,a move that has deepened divisions within the ruling party.\n\nOur Vice President decides to turn the Presidium into a kangaroo court. An inquisitive court.KutongaPresident citing that document which was authored by Kasukuwere and his colleagues, Mutsvangwa told journalists at a press briefing in Harare, Thursday, expressing his disapproval of Chiwengas actions.\n\nMutsvangwa claimed that everyone in the Politburo professed ignorance about the origins of the dossier, with the exception of Chiwengaleading to speculation that the Vice President is acting alone.\n\nHefurther suggested that the incident had served as a reminder to Chiwenga that he is merely a Presidential appointee and lacks independent powerandshould conduct himself accordingly.\n\nIt reminded the Presidium that you are appointees of the President like us. You have no powers as the Presidium. And it was one person among these Presidium members who was championing that document. All these other people were just being dragged along.\n\nThe Politburo asked who penned the document, do you accept the ownership individually? All other members of the Presidium said we dont know where it came from. So it zeroed in on the Vice President.\n\nChiwenga has consistentlyslammed corruption, describing it as a national security threat. He has also repeatedly warned those who amass wealth through unscrupulous means to watch their backs, suggesting that their day of reckoning is coming.\n\nThe individuals named in the dossier are alleged to be securing government tenders through corrupt practices. These allegations are not new, but their formal presentation within the Politburo has brought the issue to a head.\n\nFor instance, Chivayo previously defrauded ZESA of US$5 million in the Gwanda Solar Power project through his Intratek Company, and failed to deliver on the project.\n\nTagwirei has been linked to the over US$3 billion Command Agriculture scandal and is also implicated in the recent dossier alleging that approximately US$3.2 billion has been stolen from state coffers. Meanwhile, Paul Tungwarara secured a tender to drill 10,000 boreholes under the Presidential Borehole Drilling Scheme, but was recently criticised by Parliament for failing to deliver.\n\nThe government has acknowledged that it is losing US$2 billion annually due to corruption and illicit financial dealings, making the current accusations all the more damaging and increasing the pressure on Mnangagwa to take action.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nHuge crowds of mourners in Kenya fled screaming after police fired gunshots and tear gas in a stadium where they had gathered to see the body of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga.\n\nSeveral people at the arena, located in the capital Nairobi, were reportedly injured in the chaos as security officers sought to disperse the surging crowds.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether the police were using live ammunition or rubber bullets.\n\nOdingas body was flown back from India, where he died on Wednesday morning. Thousands of supporters had earlier travelled to the countrys main airport to receive the coffin, in an outpouring of grief that forced a brief halt to flights.\n\nThe authorities said mourners had gained access to restricted areas, prompting a precautionary closure that lasted about two hours.\n\nFrom the airport, thousands of people moved in a procession to escort the vehicle carrying the body to the stadium, about 10km (six miles) from the city centre.\n\nBecause of the unexpectedly large crowds, the public viewing ceremony for Odingas body was moved to Nairobis Moi International Sports Centre in the Kasarani neighbourhood, rather than inside the parliament building where it was initially scheduled to take place.\n\nThe convoy arrived to a packed stadium, with more people waiting outside.\n\nMinutes afterwards, a large crowd breached a gate in the arena, prompting the police to fire tear gas. Masses of mourners rushed towards the exits in response.\n\nA BBC reporter at the scene also saw men in civilian clothing beating protesters with batons.\n\nAt least three people were visibly injured and one had a serious head wound, the AFP news agency reported.\n\nAfter the chaos had settled, government officials and dignitaries were able to view it the coffin.\n\nA stream of supporters had earlier gathered at Lee Funeral Home, where the body was first expected, and around parliament.\n\nI came here at six in the morning. We have been at the airport to welcome Baba [Odingas nickname], one mourner had told the BBC near the airport.\n\nWe are sad, we have been left as orphans. He is our father.\n\nMotorcycle rider William Otieno Adoyo said he was a Baba die-hard.\n\nWe want to see Baba, how do we know its him in the casket? Let them show us and well be contented, he told the BBC.\n\nMourners have been carrying twigs and palm branches, a symbol of mourning and grief among the Luo ethnic group that Odinga belonged to.\n\nThe state funeral will be held at the Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi on Friday and on Saturday his body will be transported to Kisumu, a city in western Kenya on the shores of Lake Victoria  his political stronghold.\n\nMembers of the public will get a chance to view the body before he is buried on Sunday at his farm in Bondo, about 60km west of Kisumu.\n\nAccording to the family, it was Odingas wish to be laid to rest within the shortest time possible, ideally within 72 hours.\n\nThe 80-year-old former prime minister collapsed during a morning walk in India on Wednesday morning and he was taken to Devamatha Hospital, about 50km (30 miles) east of the port city of Kochi.\n\nA seven-day period of mourning has been declared. Odinga will also be accorded a state funeral with full military honours, Kenyan President William Ruto said.\n\nHe was towering figure in Kenyan politics and for many years was the countrys main opposition leader, losing five presidential campaigns, most recently three years ago.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nThe US has downplayed claims that Hamas is violating the ceasefire deal with Israel by not returning all the bodies of dead hostages.\n\nOnly nine of the 28 dead hostages have been returned, with Hamas saying it needs time and specialised equipment to recover the others from the ruins of Gaza.\n\nThe latest wo bodies returned on Wednesday have been identified as Inbar Hayman and Sgt Maj Muhammad al-Atresh, the Israel Defense Forces said early on Thursday.\n\nThe row over the return of dead hostages has led Israel to limit promised aid supplies to Gaza, but two senior advisers to US President Donald Trump have said plans to demilitarise the Strip and build a new transitional government are under way.\n\nIn an update on the implementation of Trumps 20-point peace plan, the advisers told reporters that the US government did not so far believe Hamas had broken the agreement by not retrieving more remains.\n\nThe advisers argued that Hamas had acted in good faith by returning all living hostages and was working with various interlocutors to find and return the remains of the others.\n\nHamass armed wing said in a statement it was committed to the deal but had returned all the bodies of hostages it was able to reach.\n\nOne senior US adviser said the recovery of all the bodies could take weeks because of the level of destruction in Gaza.\n\nHe said rewards might be offered for Gazan civilians who gave information and that Turkish experts were expected to join the search.\n\nConfirming the return of two more deceased hostages on Thursday, the IDF said Hayman was 27 when she was killed by Hamas on 7 October 2023 at the Nova festival. Her body was taken into the Gaza Strip.\n\nSgt Maj al-Atresh, who was 39, fell in combat on the same day, the IDF said.\n\nHamas is required to fulfill its part of the agreement and make the necessary efforts to return all the hostages to their families and to a dignified burial, it added.\n\nIn a statement, the Hostages Families Forum said: The families of the hostages and of those released embrace the families of Inbar Hayman and Muhammad al-Atresh, whose loved ones came home yesterday for proper burial in Israel.\n\nAlongside the grief and the understanding that their hearts will never be whole, the return of Inbar and Muhammad, may their memories be a blessing, brings some measure of comfort to families who have lived with agonising uncertainty for over two years.\n\nWe will not rest until all 19 hostages are brought home.\n\nHamas is required to return all 28 dead hostages as part of thefirst phase of the Gaza peace plan.\n\nBut Hamass armed wing said in a statement the remaining bodies require significant efforts and specialised equipment to search for and retrieve, and we are making a great effort to close this file.\n\nEarlier, Israel said it would not compromise on hostage returns, saying the mission is not complete.\n\nIsraels defence minister said he had instructed the IDF to prepare a comprehensive plan to defeat Hamas in Gaza in the event of a renewal of the war.\n\nAfter meeting senior generals on Wednesday, Israel Katz said the military must be prepared to act if Hamas refuses to implement the peace plan.\n\nThe latest repatriations came after Israel said one of four bodies returned by Hamas on Tuesday was not one of the missing hostages.\n\nUN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcherhas urged Israel to immediately open all border crossings into Gazafor humanitarian aid, as called for in the ceasefire plan.\n\nIn a post on X, Fletcher said Hamas must make strenuous efforts to return all the bodies of the deceased hostages.\n\nHe added: As Israel has agreed, they must allow the massive surge of humanitarian aid  thousands of trucks a week  on which so many lives depend, and on which the world has insisted.\n\nHe called for a genuine, practical, problem-solving approach to removing remaining obstacles and said withholding aid from civilians is not a bargaining chip.\n\nTrumps ceasefire plan, which both Israel and Hamas accepted, envisaged the handover of all 48 hostages would be completed by noon on Monday. Hamas returned all the 20 living hostages on Monday.\n\nBut the US-brokered ceasefire agreement appears to acknowledge that Hamas and other Palestinian factions may not have been able to find all hostage remains before the initial deadline on Monday.\n\nUnder the agreement, Israel also agreed to hand over the bodies of 15 Palestinians in return for every deceased Israeli hostage.\n\nSo far, Israel has returned the bodies of 90 Palestinians in exchange for the Israeli hostages remains.\n\nMeanwhile in Gaza, residents report growing concern about the durability of the ceasefire  and food prices have surged as Palestinians stockpile food.\n\nTraders and suppliers in the enclave have been hoarding food items to create shortages and drive up profits, fearing that the war could resume, local residents told the BBC.\n\nEvery time we start to feel safe, new threats appear, and we fear the war will start all over again, says mother-of-six Neven Al-Mughrabi, a displaced resident from Gaza who lives in Khan Younis.\n\nI lost my house in Gaza City, I decided to stay here with my family because I dont trust the ceasefire and were sick of displacement.\n\nShe added that a trader in Khan Youniss main market said demand for flour, oil and sugar had surged within hours. Despite the sudden rise of prices by about 30%, people are buying as if they dont trust the calm will last long, everyone is afraid aid will stop, Neven says.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA High Court has found a Harare nurse, Bridget Makaza, guilty of deliberately shooting her husband three times as he slept in their Strathaven home, in what the judge described as a calculated act of vengeance fueled by jealousy and deceit.\n\nJusticeEmelia Muchawa, sitting with assessors Mhandu and Barwa, ruled that Makaza planned and executed the murder of her husband, Macloud Zvavovaviri Mapanga, in May 2018 before fabricating a fake robbery to conceal the crime.\n\nThe accused unlawfully and with intent to kill, executed her husband while he slept, Justice Muchawa said in a damning finding. She aimed at the upper part of his body and delivered three fatal shots on the shoulders and neck, then staged an armed robbery to cover her tracks.\n\nThe court heard that the accused used a .38 Amadeo Rossi revolver with an erased serial number, which she had smuggled into Zimbabwe from South Africa after claiming she travelled there to buy medication.\n\nAccording to the State, on the night of May 14, 2018, the accused waited until her husband was asleep before firing three bullets, two in the shoulders and one grazing the neck. She then screamed Thief! Thief!, claiming robbers had broken in and stolen US$12,000.\n\nProsecutor B. Murevanhema said, There were no robbers. There was no break-in. The story was a fabrication to mask premeditated murder.\n\nPolice investigations uncovered inconsistencies in her story. The house had no signs of forced entry, and the firearm, gloves and metal objects were later recovered from a swampy area in Belvedere after the accused led detectives to the spot.\n\nThe nurse initially went to Mabelreign Police Station to lodge a false report of armed robbery. After being arrested and granted bail, she fled the country through South Africa and remained on the run until her re-arrest in December 2024 when she returned to Zimbabwe, claiming she missed her children.\n\nDuring the rial, the accused claimed she shot her husband in self-defence, saying he had accused her of witchcraft and attempted to attack her with the same gun.\n\nThe gun went off during a scuffle. I never intended to kill him, she told the court, further alleging years of abuse and marital rape.\n\nHowever, the judge dismissed her account as a lame and incredible fabrication, noting that forensic evidence showed the gun could not have discharged accidentally.\n\nA revolver requires deliberate trigger pressure. It cannot fire itself, said forensic expert Admire Mutizwa, whose testimony was pivotal in discrediting the self-defence claim.\n\nEvidence showed that Mapanga had multiple wives, up to eight, a fact the accused never accepted. While the court acknowledged possible emotional and sexual abuse, it found no credible proof of sustained physical violence.\n\nThe accused lied to everyone, the police, the neighbours, and even the court, Justice Muchawa noted. She lived a lie from the night of the shooting until her arrest. Her story about robbers was a deliberate deceit to obstruct justice.\n\nThe court concluded that Makaza procured the murder weapon in South Africa, smuggled it into Zimbabwe, and waited for an opportune moment to kill her husband.\n\nShe was methodical. She retrieved the gun while her husband was asleep and fired at close range, the judge said. Her conduct before, during, and after the murder shows beyond doubt that this was a planned execution.\n\nThe court found her guilty of murder with actual intent.\n\nSentencing is expected to follow.\n\n",

This prompted the ZWPSL, led by chairperson Chido Chizondo, to request written confirmation of Magayas support and proof that funds had been deposited into the clubs account.\n\nDespite reportedly meeting these conditions, the league remained silent, later indicating that the matter had been referred to the ZIFA national board.\n\nThe saga came to an end on Wednesday morning when Maningi Queens announced that their bid for readmission had been officially rejected.\n\nWe would want to announce that MYSA has now been formally dismissed from the ZWPSL following our request to rejoin, despite finding a big sponsor willing to help us now and in the following seasons.\n\nIt is a very sad day for womens football as the livelihoods of many young players, support personnel, and the technical team are at immediate risk. Moreover, this situation could seriously derail the momentum of womens football development in the country at a time when there is a national push towards grassroots football, girl-child mass participation, and rebuilding Zimbabwean football, read part of the Maningi Queens statement.\n\nThe club further criticised what it described as unprofessional conduct by some womens football administrators in handling their case.\n\nIt is also very worrying how constitution violations have become a disturbing habit among some individuals entrusted with leadership positions in womens football across the country. This continues to highlight a growing culture in which personal interests and unilateral decision-making overshadow the principles of accountability, transparency, and fairness.\n\nWe are stronger together and we hope that one day ZIFA will roll out urgent reforms and stronger oversight mechanisms to protect our loved sport and the vulnerable.\n\n",
