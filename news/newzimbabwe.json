            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nComedienne Mai TT, has, in a shocking twist, publicly apologised to businesswoman Shingirayi Ziwange Jere, who slapped her with a US$100,000 defamation lawsuit.\n\nShingirayi is the wife of CAPS United owner and Zanu PF legislator, Farai Jere.\n\nThis marks a notable departure from the socialites past approach to public disputes, where she rarely apologises.\n\nI would like to offer my deepest and most sincere apology to Hon. Farai Jere and his wife, Mrs. Shingi Ziwange-Jere, for the posts made on social media regarding you. I regret the hurt and distress caused and take full responsibility for my actions.\n\nIt was never my intention to bring harm or disrespect. I acknowledge the damage done. Please accept this apology with genuine remorse, said Mai TT in a Facebook post.\n\nThe lawsuit followed Mai TTs Facebook posts on June 9, where she accused Jere of threatening her, orchestrating assaults, and manipulating the justice system.\n\nThe businesswoman represented by lawyer Admire Rubaya labelled the claims unfounded, fabricated and portrayed her as a criminal queenpin.\n\nIn addition to the lawsuit, Jere lodged a criminal complaint under Zimbabwes Cyber and Data Protection Act, citing cyberbullying, harassment, and spreading false information.\n\nBefore the public apology, Mai TT said she had accepted that certain conflicts cannot be won.\n\nI have never created a fake account or utilised a ghost account to attack anyone, as I believe in expressing myself directly and honestly. However, when I respond to someone who has initially attacked me, I am often perceived as being in the wrong.\n\nI am willing to accept that there are certain conflicts that cannot be won. I often wonder what I have done to provoke such behaviour, but I recognise that some individuals will fabricate reasons to criticise me.\n\n",

The hostels are characterised by raw sewage and a lack of water, amid a ballooning number of residents.\n\nCHRA said the situation is likely to worsen, with HCC failing to take responsibility for renovating the flats.\n\nThe court had ruled that the city must take immediate action to restore dignity and protect public health by upgrading the dilapidated and unsanitary Mbare hostels, which have long suffered from broken sewer systems, water shortages, and unsafe living conditions.\n\nNow, instead of complying with the judgment, the City of Harare is fighting to reverse the ruling, raising alarm bells among housing rights advocates and public health experts. This move threatens to deepen the housing and hygiene crisis already faced by thousands of Mbare residents, many of whom live in overcrowded, hazardous environments, said CHRA.\n\n",
