            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Harare Municipal MedicalAidSociety (HMMAS) has lost a case in which it was claiming a refund of US$138,000 from former Zanu PF legislator Munyaradzi Kereke following a failed purchase of his Fortress Hospital in Ruwa.\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Jacob Mafusire dismissed the application by HMMAS, describing the demand as opportunistic.\n\nThe plaintiff has failed to prove any aspect of its case.\n\nThe first defendant destroyed the plaintiffs case completely. The plaintiff has no case. This suit is manifestly opportunistic. The defendants are entitled to judgment, he said before throwing out the claim.\n\nHMMAS had sued Kereke and Briward Trading (PVT) seeking a refund in the sum of US$138,000 plus interest.\n\nThe plaintiff also sought anorder confirming the cancellation of anagreement of sale between itself andKereke.\n\nIt also wanted the court to declare that itpaid the full purchase price forthemedical institution,Fortress Hospital.\n\nHMMAS had claimed that in November 2014, it purchased Fortress Hospital from the defendants via two agreements.\n\nIt said one was for the immovable property, Stand 9653 Ruwa Township, upon which the hospital is built.\n\nThe other, on the same day, granted the plaintiff the right of first refusal for the movables and other assets associated with the hospital.\n\nThe defendants (Kereke and Briward Trading) were represented by their agent, Newton Madzika\n\nThe plaintiff was represented by its former Chief Executive Officer, Evaristo Rukasha.\n\nThe purchase price for the immovable property was US$800,000. The purchase price for the equipment and fittings was US$650,000.\n\nHMMAS said itduly paid the purchase prices.\n\nThe US$800,000 was paid in two tranches, US$700,000 through a bank then known as Kingdom/Afrasia, now defunct, and the balance through a firm of legal practitioners, Muza & Nyapadi, the conveyancers appointed to transfer title in the immovable property, reads court papers.\n\nThe US$650,000 for the assets was subsequently paid through Madzika.\n\nIt was alleged that on 21 March 2022, Kereke connived with Rukasha, who, in an act of abuse of office, signed an acknowledgement of debt on behalf of the plaintiff for US$400,000 in favour of the defendants, allegedly as outstanding amounts for Fortress Hospital.\n\nRukasha, it was alleged, caused some payments to be made in terms of the acknowledgement of debt.\n\nThe payments were irregular because the plaintiff had fully paid for the hospital.\n\nFollowing disciplinary proceedings, Rukasha was dismissed from employment.\n\nRelying on the acknowledgement of debt aforesaid, the first defendant, through threats, fraudulent misrepresentations and intimidation, coerced or manipulated the plaintiff into signing an agreement on 31 August 2023.\n\nAccording to the 31 August 2023 agreement, the purchase price was US$1,138,900, of which US$866,900 was acknowledged to have been paid, leaving a balance of US$272,000 outstanding.\n\nHMMAS said it had since paid US$138,000 in various instalments before its newly reconstituted Board, led by one Zacharia Murerwa, considered that the 31 August 2023 agreement was unlawful and unenforceable by reason of the fact that it had been induced by fraud or duress\n\nThus, initssuit the plaintiffsoughtconfirmation that it bought and paid for Fortress Hospital long back in 2014, that it is entitled to get transfer of the immovable property and all the assets associated with the hospital, and that the payment of US$138,000 aforesaid that it had made to the defendants allegedly under an unlawful agreement, should be refunded.\n\nKereke challenged the claim.\n\nHe said it took more than 8  years for the defendants to finally have access to the deposit of US$700,000 aforesaid.\n\nHe also said the defendants have never received the balance of US$100,000.\n\nHe said on the plaintiffs instructions, Muza andNyapadi diverted the plaintiffs payment for something else.\n\nKereke also said the amount of $650,000 allegedly paid by the plaintiff through Madzika, or his trusts, allegedly towards the assets for Fortress Hospital, was never received by the defendants.\n\nKereke said the pleadings are inelegant.\n\nHe also said it has been quite a mission to stitch together a coherent narrative from the divergent versions of the facts as presented by the parties.\n\nThe High Court found no favour with the plaintiff, ruling that Kereke had managed to defend himself well.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nDespite President Emmerson Mnangagwas repeated promises to provide free basic education, dozens of pupils were turned away from government schools for failing to pay fees as the second term kicked off.\n\nThe Information Ministry Permanent Secretary, Nick Mangwana, on Tuesday reported that some schools in Chegutu were going against government policy and sending pupils home over unpaid fees.\n\nContrary to Govt policy, some schools in Chegutu are sending students home over non-payment of fees. Some parents struggle with recent fee hikes and added expenses for winter uniforms. Govt directive is clear: no child should be sent home due to fee non-payment, Mangwana wrote.\n\nMangwana added that while the government recognises that the fees contract is between the school and the parent, schools should not exploit this position.\n\nSchools cannot use a childs future to extort money out of a parent, much to the detriment of the learner. Schools have other means of debt recovery at their disposal, the same way as any other creditor, he said.\n\nThe issue was not only confined to Chegutu, as the same was noted in some government schools nationwide.\n\nIn an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Obert Msaraure, President of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) said that the government was failing the education system.As we predicted, our schools are once again opening to chaos. Chaos born out of policy inconsistencies, neglect of education, corruption and incompetence. It is strange for the government to be complaining about learners being sent back home for failing to pay fees, Masaraure said.\n\nMasaraure reminded the government of its constitutional duties, adding that even Zanu PFs previous election manifestos were predicated on free education for learners.Government is responsible for providing state-funded education in line with s75 of the constitution and our more elaborate Education Act. The election manifesto of the ruling ZANU PF party for two thousand and twenty-three spoke to state-funded education.\n\nGovernment should be releasing education grants to all learners across the country on an equity basis. Issuing instructions to heads not to send back learners is cynical, cruel and hypocritical. Public schools do not operate in the air. Just like the elite schools where ministers children get elite education, our public schools need teaching and learning materials.\n\n",

            "content": "Once, playing at a casino meant getting dressed, going out, and settling in for hours at the tables. For plenty of players, that was part of the magic, from the atmosphere to the sense of occasion. But times have changed. Todays players want something different. They want flexibility, ease, and most of all, speed. Thats why mobile casinos have stepped in and taken over  and why they arent giving the market back anytime soon.\n\nIn the modern world, everything competes for attention. People expect to do things quickly and on their terms. Streaming shows, ordering food, and messaging friends  it all happens in an instant. Casino gaming has followed suit. Online platforms likeBetway casinohave made it possible for players to enjoy their favorite games without being tied to a desktop or traditional casino floor. Slots, roulette, blackjack, and newer favorites like Aviator are now just a tap away.\n\nThis shift isnt just about going mobile for the sake of it. Its about making the experience fit into real life. Players no longer need to plan their gaming sessions around big blocks of free time; Whether its during a lunch break, while commuting, or unwinding after a long day, mobile casinos adapt to a players schedule. That kind of convenience has changed how people engage with games.\n\nBut speed matters just as much as accessibility. Mobile casinos thrive because they offer fast-loading games that get straight to the action. Nobody wants to wait through endless animations or clunky menus. Aviator, for example, is designed perfectly for mobile play. The concept is simple  watch the multiplier rise, decide when to cash out, and try to stay ahead of the crash. Its easy to grasp, fast to play, and perfect for those short bursts of entertainment that mobile users often prefer.\n\nPlatforms like Betway understand this balance. They have invested in delivering smooth, responsive gameplay that works seamlessly across devices. Menus are clear, loading is quick, and nothing gets in the way. The result? Players dive straight into the game without wrestling with slow screens or clunky menus. Its smooth, simple, and exactly how it should be.\n\nAnother major factor is choice. Mobile casinos today arent limited in the way they once were. Modern platforms offer hundreds, sometimes thousands, of games right at your fingertips. Whether youre a fan of classic slots or prefer newer concepts like crash games, theres always something ready to play. This variety ensures that mobile players get the same rich experience they would expect from a traditional online casino, if not more.\n\nWhat ties all of this together is trust. Players need to feel confident that mobile play doesnt mean sacrificing security or fairness. Thats why established names like Betway continue to lead. Their platforms offer not only speed and convenience but also the reliability and transparency players expect. From encrypted transactions to clear game rules, everything is designed with user confidence in mind.\n\nIn the end, the rise of mobile casinos isnt a temporary trend. Its a response to what players want today. Fast, flexible, and user-focused gaming experiences are here to stay. Whether youre chasing multipliers in Aviator or spinning the reels, mobile platforms have proven they can deliver  wherever and whenever you choose to play.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/why-the-nhs-must-make-innovation-its-top-priority/",
            "content": "By Dr Richard Dune\n\nAn in-depth look at the fourth shift the NHS urgently needs, moving from research to reality to strengthen care across all system parts.\n\nWhen people across Africa think of the UKs National Health Service (NHS), they often think of excellence, world-class teaching hospitals, cutting-edge medicine, and free care at the point of delivery. For many Zimbabweans in the diaspora, the NHS is not only a place of work but also a lifeline for their families and communities. But beneath that reputation lies a system now in critical flux, and the stakes have never been higher.\n\nWith the dissolution of NHS England, budget pressures on Integrated Care Boards (ICBs), and uncertainty over future innovation funding, we are seeing the end of a chapter in British healthcare. Yet this moment also offers a unique opportunity: to reshape the NHS into something more resilient, equitable, and innovative, particularly for the communities that have often been overlooked.\n\nEarlier this year, the Wellcome Trust issued a powerful directive: make research and innovation the fourth strategic shift in the NHS. This new shift should sit alongside three long-standing goals:\n\nBut heres the truth: the other three shifts cant succeed without the fourth. The system will continue to buckle under pressure without innovation in everyday NHS practice, especially outside major hospitals.\n\nMany Zimbabweans working in health and social care across the UK are not based in elite hospitals like Cambridge or Imperial. They work in care homes, GP practices, district nursing, home care services, and mental health support roles. Yet innovation and research funding rarely reach these corners of the system.\n\nIf we truly believe that healthcare happens in the community, research and innovation must follow. But today, those working on the frontlines often lack:\n\nThis is where the disconnect lies, and where the opportunity begins.\n\nThe NHS isnt just struggling with inertia; its navigating a storm:\n\nAnd yet, innovation cant be an afterthought. It must be a daily part of delivering care, from the inner-city clinic in London to the remote outreach teams in Cornwall.\n\nTo moveFrom Research to Reality, we need five bold changes, especially in community and primary care settings:\n\nThis is not about research for its own sake. Its about:\n\nFor those of us from Zimbabwe and across Southern Africa, this conversation matters more than we might think. Many of us are part of the NHS workforce. Some of us are carers, nurses, consultants, therapists, or tech innovators. We see the cracks in the system every day, but we also see the possibilities.\n\nInnovation is not just the responsibility of those in power. Its a shared duty, especially for those on the frontline, those building health and social care businesses, and those leading change in community settings.\n\nWhat lessons can Zimbabwe and the wider region draw from this? That innovation in healthcare doesnt have to wait for billion-pound hospitals. It can start in clinics, mobile health units, digital tools, and grassroots participation. Just like the NHS must now reimagine itself from the ground up, many African systems have the opportunity to leapfrog legacy issues and build responsive, community-led health models using research, data, and locally relevant solutions.\n\nFor those working in or with the NHS, this is also a moment to shape the system from within, by championing local trials, sharing insights, and refusing to let bureaucracy block progress.\n\nAs the NHS evolves in this new post-structure era, lets not wait for permission to innovate. Lets build a system where research is part of daily life, not a distant concept confined to academia. Because without this fourth shift, the other three wont just stalltheyll collapse.\n\nAnd for the NHS, diaspora communities who rely on it, and global health systems looking on,there is no future without innovation.\n\nDr Richard Dune is the CEO of LearnPac Systems, a leading UK provider of edtech and compliance software solutions for regulated sectors.

Well be opening it to traffic in May 2025. Stay tuned for the grand opening!! reads a post on the ministrys X handle.\n\nThe Trabablas Interchange, built at a staggering US$88 million, was once a notorious traffic bottleneck. It was transformed into a multi-level interchange aimed at easing traffic congestion and boosting regional trade.\n\nWhile the development promises improved infrastructure and economic benefits, it has faced criticism over its high cost, safety concerns, and a questionable renaming after President Emmerson Mnangagwa, whose wartime nickname was Trabablas.\n\nSituated in the heart of Harare, where Simon Mazorodze, Chitungwiza, and High Glen roads converge, the massive infrastructure project has been taking shape for years.\n\nAccording to government, the roadworks are a critical junction along the Harare-Beitbridge highway and touted as a game-changer for easing traffic congestion and boosting regional trade.\n\nThe Mbudzi roundabout, as it was previously known, was a notorious bottleneck in Harare. During peak hours, commuters faced agonizing delays as vehicles from western Chitungwiza, surrounding suburbs, and the Harare-Masvingo highway converged in a chaotic snarl.\n\nHeavy regional traffic heading to and from South Africa exacerbated the gridlock. For years, the roundabout was a daily struggle for motorists and a barrier to efficient transport along one of Zimbabwes most vital trade routes.\n\n",
