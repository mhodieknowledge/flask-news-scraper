            "content": "The East African\n\nZimbabwes plans to drop the US dollar in five years is already causing jitters in an economy that has suffered nearly two decades of currency volatility and bouts of record hyperinflation.\n\nHarare has set 2030 as the target to stop using the US dollar, which has been the dominant foreign currency for the past 16 years, after it was forced to abandon its own.\n\nZimbabwe first announced on August 6, 2024 that its Cabinet had approved a roadmap to adopt the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) as the sole currency. The gold-backed ZiG was launched last year, the countrys sixth attempt at mooting a stable currency in 25 years.\n\nThe central bank concedes that businesses are nervous about the plan to return to a mono-currency regime, so much that banks are now avoiding long-term lending beyond that date.\n\nJohn Mushayavanhu, Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor, said he would announce a comprehensive de-dollarisation roadmap in November, in what is seen as a desperate attempt to calm nerves.\n\nDr Mushayavanhu said the roadmap would focus on the need to preserve foreign currency accounts and the existing US dollar-denominated contracts, with considerations made to ensure business continuity and certainty.\n\nThe central bank says it is working on modernising the ZiG banknotes with re-designing and producing improved banknotes to increase the acceptance of the new currency.The roadmap will undoubtedly encapsulate the need to maintain the current stability, preserve the foreign currency accounts and existing USD-dominated contracts, Dr Mushayavanhu said as he presented the 2025 mid-term monetary policy statement.\n\nConsideration will always be made to ensure that there is business continuity and certainty.The Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI), the countrys largest business grouping with membership from the manufacturing, trade, transport, information technology, education and professional services, said the success of the de-dollarisation strategy would hinge on controlling inflation.Low levels of inflation will help build trust in the currency, which might also encourage greater usage of ZiG in transactions, CZI said. This could also boost the likelihood of a gradual de-dollarisation process leading to a ZiG mono-currency regime by 2030. The high annual inflation level creates pricing uncertainty, making it difficult for businesses to set prices, forecast costs or even negotiate contracts.\n\nThe team advised the authorities to urgently introduce measures to increase demand for the ZiG and institute other reforms if the de-dollarisation plan is to succeed.The mission emphasised the need to continue strengthening the monetary and foreign currency market framework in line with IMF staff recommendations, said Wojciech Maliszewski, head of the IMF team.\n\nThis should be complemented by measures to enhance the demand for ZiG in the domestic economy- most notably, increasing the share of Treasurys operations (revenues and expenditures) in ZiG. To reduce any uncertainty weighing on financial intermediation, the authorities should provide more clarity on the implications of the transition plan, including clarifying that the use of a mono-currency will be limited to domestic transactions, allowing for bank deposits to remain dominated in both currencies.\n\nOver a year since the introduction of the ZiG, the country is still heavily reliant on the US dollar, with the central bank indicating that only 40 percent of transactions are in local currency.\n\nEconomic analysts say the new currency is being undermined by the same factors that thwarted previous efforts to re-establish a sole currency. These include a lack of confidence in the banking sector and the local economy, as well as the large scale of the unregulated informal economy, which according to the World Bank is the largest in the world.\n\nJohn Lagat, Imara Asset Management CEO, said the ZiG was destined for extinction just like the other currencies before it because it was being rendered irrelevant by the market.There is so little ZiG around  thanks to the very tight monetary policy  that it is easier simply to use US dollar cash or bank cards. We continue to believe that way too much time and energy is spent on dealing with and discussing the ZiG, despite its limited use, that it would be better simply to scrap it and move on, he said.\n\nHe added that the ZiG was largely used in Harare while in the southern parts of the country people favoured the South African rand.On our recent travels around, it would appear that the South African rand is the favoured currency in the southern parts of Zimbabwe, whilst the US dollar is king further north. Indeed, it is only in the capital Harare that the ZiG is used to any extent. The civil servants continue to receive part of their remuneration in ZiG, which they attempt to spend in the formal shops since the formal economy has no use for it.\n\nAccording to the IMF, only four out of 85 countries that were surveyed during the 1980 to 2001 period succeeded in de-dollarisation, which makes Zimbabwes attempt to return to a mono-currency regime an uphill task.\n\nZimbabwe started facing acute currency problems in 1997 when the local dollar crashed dramatically that year after Robert Mugabes regime paid unbudgeted pensions to former fighters of the countrys liberation struggle.\n\nThe crisis deepened when Zimbabwe sent troops to the Democratic Republic of Congo to protect Laurent Kabilas under siege regime.\n\nA chaotic land reform programme that began in the year 2000 proved to be the final nail on the coffin for the local currency as it led to the countrys international isolation and economic collapse.\n\nBy the time Mugabes government abandoned the Zimbabwe dollar in 2009 when the inflation rate peaked at 79.6 billion percent in mid-November. Hyperinflation only ended after the adoption of the US dollar.\n\n",

            "content": "The Star\n\nGolden Moyo* is a lay preacher in rural Zimbabwe. In 2018, after decades of hiding his sexual orientation, Moyo came out to his family and friends and his parish as gay.\n\nAttitudes to sexual and gender minorities in Zimbabwe are highly conservative. Those found guilty of consensual same-sex sexual activity could face up to one years imprisonment and a fine. The southern African countrys anti-homosexuality law was first introduced by the British during its colonisation of Zimbabwe.\n\nAccording toHuman Dignity Trust, the country has noted consistent reports of discrimination and violence being committed against LGBTQIA+ people in recent years, including assault, sexual violence, harassment, blackmail, and the denial of basic rights and services.\n\nMoyos decision has not been without consequence. News of his sexuality soon went viral (with)people deliberating upon it, he says. There was alsoaprotest at the churchs headquarters.\n\nSays Moyo: They were saying things like this is against our culture. This is against our religion. This is against our lawsThey say it is strange. It is not part of us and did not originate from our own people. (That) its a Western thing. When the noise started, (with) people protesting, you really need people who stand up to say, No, this thing isnotWestern. Its our own thing. It hasalwaysbeen in our midst.\n\nFor Moyo, as with an increasing number of LGBTQIA+ persons across the country, social media is an essential tool in a continued push for a break from the narrative that homosexuality  and queerness, more broadly  is a Western import.\n\nMoyos social media accounts on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and X (formerly, Twitter) has a combined following of just under 10 000 people. He also uses Clubhouse for the (weekly) LGBTQIA+ fellowship.\n\nMoyo says he first realised the power of social media during the Covid-19 pandemic. We could not gather as Christians, so we used to worship via social media. I realised that this is a thing that can quickly spread the message to othersI thought of it as a way that my voice can also be heard.\n\nTanatswa Gumbo, communications officer for the countrys largest queer rights organisation, Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe, says LGBTQIA+ people definitely have become more visible on social media. Image: Supplied\n\nTanatswa Gumbo, communications officer for the countrys largest queer rights organisation,Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe (GALZ), says LGBTQIA+ people definitely have become more visible on social media.\n\nLGBTQIA+ persons, particularly activists, have really been visible and have really become more outspoken in terms of challenging conservative attitudes towards LGBTQIA+ people. Especially the claims of homosexuality being un-African; not being Christian, says Gumbo.\n\nResearch conducted by Princess Sibanda and Gibson Ncubefoundthat, for queer Zimbabweans, online spaces represent a powerful act of resistance, a way for queer Zimbabweans to claim their right to exist and express themselves.Its like theyre sending love letters to the world, saying that queer love is just as important and beautiful as any other kind of love.\n\nZimbabwe is, of course, only one of numerous African states to have inherited homophobic laws and attitudes as a result of colonisation. The end of colonial rule has, however, seen some countries (such as Uganda, Nigeria, Kenya and Namibia) place added restrictions on the rights of LGBTQIA+ persons.\n\nGhana is one such country. The West African state inherited its first anti-homosexuality law during British rule.Section 104 of the countrys Criminal Code of 1960  seen largely as an after-effect of the colonial era  carries with it a sentence of up to three years imprisonment for men found guilty of consensual same-sex relations.\n\nGhanas latest anti-LGBT law, thePromotion of Proper Human Sexual Rights and Ghanaian Family Values Bill (commonly known as the Anti-LGBT Bill), is particularly draconian and has been described asbrutal, harsh, and unjust.\n\nIn 2021,Angel Maxine, Ghanas only openly transgender musician and queer rights activist, penned a song, titledKill the Bill, in protest against the Anti-LGBT Bill. In addition to using her music as a tool for awareness-raising, Maxine also relies heavily on social media to try and effect change.\n\nIf social media was availableduring the colonial days, Im sure a lot of people would have been educated by now, and we would (not be in) this era that we are in, Maxine says, in reference to the increasing queerphobic rhetoric sweeping across the continent. Because even though some of us are on social media, we are still living in our colonial days; still carrying the colonial thinking. But there are also people who are using social media who have broken free from this colonialism. In Africa, we have made use of social media positively to educate people.\n\nMaxine is nowliving in Berlin, having fled Ghana as a result of persecution based on her gender identity and her queer rights activism. The distance from her home country makes her rely on social media even more.\n\nSometimes when the grounds become very hard and difficult for us to meet in person, social media is where we can meet. I am currently in Germany, but Im communicating with people in Ghana through social media.\n\nAlex Kofi Donkor, the executive director of LGBT Rights Ghana, says LGBTQIA+ Ghanaians are creating social media content that challenges the narrative that queerness is a Western import. Image:Supplied\n\nAlexKofi Donkoris the founder and executive director of LGBT Rights Ghana. I would say most of the mobilisation and most of the engagement at the initial stages (of establishing LGBT Rights Ghana)] was through social media. Even as of now, most of the mobilisation is done via various social media platforms, says Donkor.\n\nAside from activists utilising social media for policy and attitude reforms, there are also individual members of Ghanas LGBTQIA+ communities who, Donkor says, are putting content out there that challenges the status quo and challenges so many thoughts that Ghanaians have around LGBTQIA+ issuesthat its a Western import.\n\nAs could be expected, given the repressive contexts in which this content is created, there are downsides to proudly sharing pro-LGBTQIA+ content.\n\nA recent example of this was when a queer South African undertook the social media campaign, #ShowGhanaLove. Ostensibly meant as a show of solidarity with queer Ghanaians, the campaign had the opposite effect, as anti-queer politicians used the resultant public outrage to add pressure on the Ghanaian government to expedite the passing of theAnti-LGBT Bill.\n\nSays Donkor: People tend to react quickly when (LGBTQIA+ content) is openly or obviously put out there. People tend to react in a very negative way.\n\nGhanaian human rights activist, Angel Maxine, sees social media as an integral tool in raising awareness. Image: Eemmax Experience\n\nAngel Maxine is nonplussed by negative comments. Social media is a safe space for me, even though the comments and all those things arent 100% safe, it is a safe space for me, she says.\n\nSocial media, she adds, resulted in what she sees as her biggest success as an activist: the collaboration with fellow musicians,Wanlov the Kubolor and Sister Deborah, which led to her song,Wo Fie.\n\nWo Fiemeans your home, Maxine explains. We all come from homes, whether (we are) LGBTQIA or not. A queer person could be your brother, could be your sister. So we just have to love, respect and accept queer people for who they are. Religion is not our culture. The Bible is not our culture. The only culture that has been imported to Africa is hate.\n\nAs to whether she says a point at which she might rely less on social media as a tool for her activism, Maxine says firmly: No, no. I dont think I see that happening.\n\nBack in his home in rural Zimbabwe, Moyo echoes the same sentiment.\n\nYou know, he sighs, to get the church to accept us, we have attended the meetings, the synods, the meetings in the archdiocese, the councils, but it was of no useSo, theres no other way, since we have been blocked on top. So, we are saying this is the time to make our voices heardMaybe changes may comeOur people still believe its a Western influence. A taboo in our culture. Yet, we are saying its our own thing. So, we will keep on fighting, no matter how hard it gets.\n\n* Not his real name\n\n* Carl Collison is a journalist, photographer, filmmaker, and researcher.

            "content": "Lesley Hope| The Conversation\n\nThere are33 million smallholder farmersin sub-Saharan Africa, making up 80% of the total farmer population. These farmers cultivate small plots of land of less than two hectares and dont make much money, as they generally sell their produce in local markets. They usually lack the funds needed to process their crops into a product that could sell for a higher price, and they struggle to get into supply chains where they could sell for higher prices. Agricultural economist Lesley Hopehas researched what is neededfor women smallholder farmers to switch toagroecology environmentally friendly farming that works with nature  and develop thriving businesses at the same time.\n\nWomen make upover halfof sub-Saharan Africas 33 million smallholder farmers. They dont just grow crops  they also work in agroprocessing (making crops into other products) and marketing. Women farmers generally havedeep-rooted knowledgeof local ecosystems, traditional farming and ways to grow and store seeds. However, theycannot easily accessproductive resources such as land, agricultural equipment or finance.\n\nThis is why a set of farming practices that use natural inputs at a lower cost can help women smallholder farmers to build more productive farms. For example, agroecology involves environmentally friendly practices that include:\n\nAgroecology also supports local markets and a shorter chain for food from the farm to the table. In this way it reduces peoples dependency on buying food at prices that are influenced by the global market. It also means that smallholder farmers do not rely on the global market for purchase of fertilisers and pesticides for their production activities.\n\nAnother advantage of using agroecology is that livestock, fruit trees and several different crops can be farmed at the same time. This means farmers do not need to buy nearly as much as they can often grow enough to feed their families. A diverse food systemalso copes betterwith climate change.\n\nAgroecology also offers women the opportunity to create:\n\nAgroecology already falls in line with women farmers practice of backyard farming. It encourages women to use that expertise to feed their families a wider variety of foods and sell the surplus.\n\nAgroecology is practised all over Africa. In east Africa (Uganda, Tanzania)women-led cooperativesgrow organic coffee.\n\nFor example, organic farming practices based on traditional knowledge are common inKenya and other parts of east Africa. In southern Ethiopia, Burkina Faso, Senegal, Ghana and Niger,agroforestryis widely practised.\n\nSmallholder farmers in Zimbabwe and Zambia practiseconservation agriculture, an environmentally friendly farming approach that improves and maintains soil health and productivity by not disturbing or digging the soil, and by sowing a layer of different permanent cover crops.\n\nIn Cameroon, integrated pest management strategies likebiopesticidesand pest-resistant crop varieties are common. Biopesticides are types of pesticides made from natural extracts. They are environmentally friendly and have no negative impact.\n\nIn Senegal, women agroecologists have become influential and able to attract funding to improve their farms. Women inMali and Ghanaproduce bioenergy and seeds fromJatropha curcas, a plant that treats infections and muscle pain.\n\nAgroecology is also practised in South Africa, where women smallholder farmersplant trees with cropsto reduce water pollution.\n\nDespite this, many women smallholder farmers are stillseen as farmers wives, rather than farmers in their own right, and dont get the support they should.\n\nFirst, as this years president of theGroup of 20 most powerful nations, South Africa could use its position to influence policies that support the transition to agroecology. These include investing in agroecological markets, supporting womens businesses, and protecting womens rights through giving them more access to productive resources.\n\nAgroecology is a must in the current era where climate change makes it difficult to grow enough food for everyone. Given that many African women are already involved in agriculture, it makes sense for them to lead the move to agroecology.\n\nThese steps need to be taken:\n\n(1) Women farmers need to be connected to customers. Dedicated agroecological market infrastructure must be set up where women farmers can sell their crops. This can include markets for cooperatives and digital platforms that are designed around women farmers needs.\n\n(2) Once theyre connected to the market, the women farmers must get support to successfully compete with other businesses. Philanthropies and development agencies can support community-based and gender-sensitive processing hubs such as millers, driers and organic packaging. These are critical to support the women farmers to fully transition to agroecology.\n\n(3) Produce needs to becertified as organicwith an agroecological product label. This increases the markets that women smallholder farmers can sell to, and builds consumer trust. Organic certification projects can be set up by the government, philanthropic organisations, development agencies, non-governmental organisation and other groups interested in empowering women smallholder farmers through agroecology.\n\nLesley Hope\n\nLecturer: Department of Agricultural and Resource Economics, School of Agriculture and Technology, University of Energy and Natural Resources\n\n",

The company anticipates the plant to reach a sustained steady-state of operation, enabling Zulu to target overall plant availability of 22 days per month, as was originally projected as the required availability to meet target production levels.\n\nDuring the next seven days, we expect to be able to take a final decision on how soon, if at all, the purchase of the secondary spodumene float section should proceed, said Premier.\n\nAt the same time, plans are progressing with the two remaining plant issues requiring longer-term solutions, the replacement of the original OEM-supplied sorters that are not fit for purpose and completion of the tantalum recovery circuit. In regard to the tantalum circuit, we have had interest from several parties seeking to purchase tantalum and potentially assisting with the cost of the circuit.\n\nPremier has struggled to keep its spodumene production plant operating optimally since it set it up some two years ago.\n\nAs a result, it missed the target to make the first spodumene shipment to Chinese offtaker, Canmax Technologies (Canmax), by March 2023.\n\nThree months later, it declared force majeure, but Canmax contested the declaration and demanded repayment of the $35mn it provided to Premier to build the processing plant.\n\n",
