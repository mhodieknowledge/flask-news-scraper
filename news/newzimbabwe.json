            "content": "By AFP\n\nFIRST impressions can be deceptive, but Kirsty Coventry showed that behind a sunny disposition she will have the mettle to deal with the trickiest of people and situations when she succeeds Thomas Bach as president of the International Olympic Committee (IOC) on Monday.\n\nLooming large on the horizon of the 41-year-old Zimbabwean  the first woman and African to occupy the post of the most powerful single figure in sport is US President Donald Trump.With Los Angeles hosting the 2028 Olympics, Trump will feature often on Coventrys agenda.Trump has not been shy in giving public dressing downs to world leaders  notably Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his South African counterpart Cyril Ramaphosa.Judging by Coventrys initial response, after a crushing first-round victory in the presidential election in March, she may have Trumps measure.Navigating Challenges and Embracing Failure: Lessons from Coventrys CareerI have been dealing with, lets say, difficult men in high positions since I was 20 years old, she said, adding communication will be key.Unlike Trump, though, Coventry embraces the word failure, for it helped forge her stellar career.Everythings scary. Embrace that. You have to fail, Coventry told the swimming team at her American alma mater Auburn University last year.Ive learned the best lessons by failing, and I have failed at many things. Life has a really good way of humbling you.At the same time that steely resolve comes to the surface when winning is at stake.I was banned from playing card games with the family, because they didnt like to deal with me when I lost, she said.A Glance at Coventrys CV Suggests Failure in Her Life Has Been RelativeCoventry, who had the Olympic rings tattooed on a leg after her first Games in 2000, is a two-time Olympic gold medallist and she has contributed seven of Zimbabwes overall Games medals tally of eight.She has accrued domestic political experience, as she was Zimbabwes Minister for Youth, Sport, Arts and Recreation from 2019 to this year.That attracted some flak as she was serving in a government whose election in 2023 was declared to be neither free nor fair by the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ).I dont think you can stand on the sidelines and scream and shout for change, she said in her defence.I believe you have to be seated at the table to try and create it.Her record as a minister has been heavily criticised by the Zimbabwean arts community in particular.Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, whose predecessor Robert Mugabe labelled Coventry a golden girl and awarded her $100,000 after she came back with a gold medal from Beijing in 2008, hit back.Whoever was not impressed by her can appoint someone else when they become president, said the 82-year-old.Very hard timesIn 2004, Coventry gave an insight into why she would later accept such a poisoned chalice and how whites in Zimbabwe have to perform a delicate balancing act.Zimbabwe is my home, she said after returning to a heroines parade after winning her first gold medal at the Athens Olympics.Its where I was born. Its my culture. I will always represent Zimbabwe. Colour doesnt matter to me.I think every country goes through bad years and good years.Coventry had a largely urban upbringing.
