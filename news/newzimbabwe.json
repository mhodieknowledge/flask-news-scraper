            "content": "A federal judge has ordered half a dozen federal agencies to immediately reinstate probationary employees fired last month as part of the Trump administrations effort to rapidly shrink the federal workforce, calling the effort a sham.\n\nThe preliminary injunction issued from the bench Thursday by US District Judge William Alsup requires the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury to rehire the employees. The judge said that he might extend the order to cover other federal agencies at a later time.\n\nAlsup, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, said he was making the ruling because he believes the Office of Personnel Management unlawfully directed the agencies earlier this year to lay off the probationary employees, who generally have been on the job for less than a year.\n\nThe judge said the order is effective immediately: This is the order and it counts.\n\nThe Justice Department indicated Thursday that it will appeal the ruling to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe ruling came in a case brought by labor unions and others challenging OPMs role in the firings, which affected thousands of employees and sent shockwaves through various federal agencies, some of which later rehired some of the workers.\n\nAlsup was highly critical of the administrations justification for firing the employees. OPM had provided agencies with a template termination letter that cited the employees performance as the reason they were being let go. But the judge said that rationale was the governments attempt to end-run federal law setting up specific rules for reducing the federal workforce.\n\nThe reason that OPM wanted to put this based on performance was at least in part in my judgment a gimmick to avoid the Reductions in Force Act, the judge said. Because the law always allows you to fire somebody for performance.\n\nIt is a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well thats a lie, he added. That should not have been done in our country. It was a sham in order to try to avoid statutory requirements.\n\nFederal probationary employees have typically been in their positions for one year, but some jobs have two-year probationary periods. The employees may be new to the federal workforce, but they also could have been recently promoted or shifted to a different agency.\n\nAlsups ruling is one of the most significant yet in cases testing the administrations authority to quickly reduce the number of federal employees  a key priority that has been central to the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe White House called the ruling absurd and unconstitutional.\n\nA single judge is attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the Executive Branch. The President has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch  singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the Presidents agenda, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statementposted on X by another White House aide.\n\nIf a federal district court judge would like executive powers, they can try and run for President themselves, Leavitt said.\n\nA second federal judgeruled later Thursday, in a similar case brought in Maryland by Democratic state attorneys general, that probationary employees laid off en masse by the Trump administration must be temporarily reinstated. That judges temporary restraining order, which will last two weeks, applies to 18 agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental Protection Agency and the US Agency for International Development.\n\nThe preliminary injunction came after Alsup unloaded on the Justice Department for not making the acting head of the Office of Personnel Management available to testify about the Trump administrations decision to fire scores of probationary employees.\n\nHe had ordered acting OPM Director Charles Ezell to testify during Thursdays hearing, where he would likely face tough questions from attorneys representing the labor unions that are challenging his agencys role in the firings.\n\nBut the Justice Department refused to make him available and instead withdrew a declaration Ezell submitted last month that had served as the governments only evidence in the case.\n\nYoure afraid to do so because you know cross-examination will reveal the truth, Alsup told DOJ attorney Kelsey Helland. I tend to doubt that youre telling me the truth.\n\nAlsup told the DOJ attorney Thursday: You cant just say, heres a declaration, you have to accept it without question when there is a question.\n\nYoure not helping me get at the truth. Youre giving me press releases  sham documents, the judge said, referring to documents submitted by the DOJ to the court that they say shows how the agencies were making the termination decisions themselves.\n\nThe declaration from Ezell said that OPM did not direct other agencies to terminate probationary employees  the central issue in the case brought by labor unions and others.\n\nHelland pushed back strongly on the judges assertion, and argued during the hearing that the agency heads had sought to cull their workforce on their own, not at the direction of OPM.\n\nI respectfully disagree that we have submitted false evidence, he said at one point, adding later: Decisions on these employment actions were made by these agencies and were fully endorsed by their political leadership.\n\nThe Trump administration has been targeting probationary workers because they have fewer job protections and can be dismissed more easily. While they generally cannot appeal their termination to the Merit Systems Protection Board, they can if the action stemmed from partisan political reasons or marriage status. Also, they are protected from prohibited personnel practices.\n\nPart of Thursdays hearing concerned whether the employees at issue in the case have the option of appealing their firing to the MSPB, something Alsup had initially understood was possible. But the judge said he wanted the parties to submit more written legal arguments on the issue before he decides how to factor it into his ruling.\n\nOne former probationary employee who wasfired last monthfrom the IRS, an agency within the Treasury Department, told CNN that he and his colleagues were thrilled with the ruling.\n\nEveryone on the group chat is celebrating, the former IRS employee said, referring to a text chat where his former colleagues have been consoling each other in recent weeks.\n\n",

Instead of harassing vendors, the government must first of all restore economic growth and create the promised millions of jobs and by doing so, all vendors will vanish overnight, he said.\n\nDzimiri begged the government and councils to accept that the informal economy has become the biggest employer in the country and, therefore it needs to be carefully treated.\n\nHe said the ILO acknowledged the importance of the informal economy, and this years 113thSession of the International Labour Conference will have a discussion on innovative approaches to tackling informality and promoting transitions towards formality in order to promote decent work.\n\nWhat is more hypocritical for the government is that it has been encouraging people to go into self-help projects and declaring them as an eyesore now is extremely insensitive. In fact, most of the vendors are mere workers of chefs and street barons who give them wages to sell in the streets. There is also a possibility that the government is acting to appease businesses that have been losing profits to vendors, Dzimiri said.\n\nThe ZCTU added that local authorities and the central government must provide alternative places of trading where there is decency instead of reactionary policies that are inconsiderate.\n\n",

            "content": "Agency\n\nA citizen of Zimbabwe, Tatenda Banga on Thursday pleaded guilty in U.S. District Court in Seattle to two federal felonies related to his illegal border crossing in the wilderness area between Canada and Western Washington.\n\nAccording to acting U.S. Attorney Teal Luthy Miller, Banga, 30, was observed twice in 2024 on surveillance cameras near Hozomeen, Washington in the North Cascades.He pleaded guilty to being an unlawful alien in possession of firearms and possession of controlled substances with intent to distribute.\n\nHis sentencing is scheduled in front of U.S. District Judge Jamal N. Whitehead on June 12.\n\nAccording to the plea agreement, on January 3, 2024, the U.S. Border Patrol detection technology captured an image of an armed person entering the United States near the north end of Ross Lake near Hozomeen, Washington. The image shows a person, later identified as Banga, crossing over the border with a longarm shotgun. Later that day Banga is seen defacing another camera near the border.\n\nPersonnel from the Border Patrol and the National Park Service responded and searched for the person pictured in the surveillance, but the subject fled into the woods and was not located. Agents did find a loaded 12-gauge Winchester shotgun that appeared to match the gun in the surveillance image that the subject left behind during his flight from law enforcement. The gun was traced to a firearms dealer in Montreal, but no fingerprint records matching those on the gun were found at the time.\n\nOn December 27, 2024, the National Park Service alerted Border Patrol to suspected cross-border activity. A National Park Service canoe was discovered near Ross Dam with a machete and food wrappers inside the canoe. RCMP cameras provided an image of someone with a headlamp and backpack moving toward the U.S./Canada border.\n\nWhile driving Highway 20 (the North Cascades Highway) near the south end of Ross Lake, Border Patrol agents noticed Banga walking on the side of the highway. Bangas appearance matched the appearance of the individual from the RCMP surveillance images. Banga was contacted for an immigration inspection and had no documents to establish that he had legally crossed into the U.S. or that he was legally present in the U.S. When Banga was taken into custody he was found to have scales, gelatin capsules and about 1.4 pounds of MDMA in his possession.\n\nIt was then that Border Patrol Agents recognized Banga as being the same individual who was recorded defacing cameras in the area nearly a year prior. Border Patrol Agents reran the fingerprints found on the shotgun that was recovered on the U.S. side of the border back in January 2024, and the fingerprints on the gun matched to Banga. Information on Bangas phone also linked him to the shotgun. Banga admits that he unlawfully entered the U.S. while armed with the shotgun.\n\nBeing an unlawful alien in possession of a firearm is punishable by up to 15 years in prison. Possession of a controlled substance with intent to distribute is punishable by up to 20 years in prison. Judge Whitehead will determine the actual sentence after considering the sentencing guidelines and other statutory factors.\n\nThe case was investigated by the U.S. Border Patrol Blaine Sector Anti-Smuggling Unit, National Park Service, and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations (ICE HSI). The case is being prosecuted by Assistant United States Attorney Dane A. Westermeyer and Special Assistant United States Attorney Katherine Collins.\n\n",
