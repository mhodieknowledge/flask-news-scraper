            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nFor the first time in Zimbabwes history, intersex persons have taken the government to court, demanding legal recognition of their rights and protection from decades of systemic exclusion.\n\nThe High Court application, filed under case number HCH4743/25, seeks a declaratory order compelling the state to officially recognise intersex people as a distinct category under Zimbabwean law.\n\nAmong their demands are the introduction of a third sex marker on birth certificates, IDs, and passports, procedures to amend sex markers on documents, and a ban on non-consensual, non-essential surgeries on intersex minors. They also want full access to rights such as dignity, education, healthcare, and equality under the Constitution.\n\nThe case has seven applicants, including two minors denied education and social services because their documents did not reflect their lived realities. One adult applicant was subjected to irreversible surgery as a child, leaving them with lifelong health complications and mismatched identity papers.\n\nThe minors are being represented by their legal guardians.\n\nThe Health Law and Policy Consortium (HLPC) and the Intersex Community of Zimbabwe (ICoZ) have also joined the case as institutional applicants. Cited as respondents are the Registrar-General, the Ministers of Home Affairs, Health, and Justice, and the Attorney General.\n\nIn his founding affidavit, Tinashe Mundawarara, HLPC board chairperson, argued that failure to issue accurate identity documents violates childrens constitutional rights.\n\nSection 81 (1)(c) specifically guarantees every child the right to a birth certificate, he said. By failing to ensure that intersex children are issued birth certificates that reflect their unique biological reality, the respondents deny them a fundamental right and create barriers to accessing essential services such as healthcare and education.\n\nHLPC programs coordinator Dorcas Chitiyo added: This case seeks to address the systematic legal and administrative failures that have perpetuated exclusion, discrimination and harm against intersex persons in Zimbabwe.\n\nICoZ director Kudakwashe Murisa said intersex people have endured silence and invisibility for too long.\n\nThis case is historic. For the first time, the Zimbabwean legal system is being challenged to recognise the rights of intersex individuals as equal human beings under the Constitution, they said.\n\nMurisa stressed that the matter goes beyond individual struggles.\n\nThis case is not just about one individual. It is about an entire community that has been made invisible for too long. It is about ensuring that no intersex child will endure what so many others have suffered in silence.\n\nAs an intersex person, Murisa described the personal toll of mismatched documents: Being intersex, I have to explain myself each time I want to use my identity documents. This is because they dont match with the sex I was assigned at birth.\n\nThe matter is yet to be heard.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nAs the succession battle within Zanu-PF intensifies, President Emmerson Mnangagwa has moved to stave off any potential coup by awarding more than 700 senior army officers top-of-the-range, all-terrain vehicles, his spokesperson George Charamba has confirmed.\n\nMnangagwas decision follows his absence from the United Nations General Assembly amid intelligence reports suggesting the possible arrest of his loyalists, controversial business tycoons Kudakwashe Tagwirei, Wicknell Chivayo, Delish Nguwaya, and Paul Tungwarara.\n\nThe four were reportedly named in a corruption dossier Vice President Constantino Chiwenga presented at the recent Zanu-PF politburo meeting in Harare.\n\nHaunted by the spectre of November 2017, Mnangagwa appears to be taking no chances, seeking to appease the military, the traditional kingmakers in Zimbabwean politics.\n\nHis Excellency the President today handed over 102 vehicles to the ZDF in order to capacitate the Defence Force. All told, the ZDF will get over 700 vehicles, the first ever time that ZDF has received such a consignment within a short-time bracket, Charamba announced on his X account on Monday.\n\nThe timing has raised eyebrows, with many viewing the gesture as a clear coup-proofing strategy.\n\nCharamba defended the move, framing it as a fulfilment of service conditions for senior officers: The vehicles, which are part of the conditions of service for senior army officers, plug a gap in conditions of service for officers, some of whom had gone for a couple of years without a full set of their entitlements.\n\nHowever, he also revealed the allocation is structured as a loan. In public sector parlance, these vehicles are called personal issue service vehicles. What that means is that the vehicle is personal to the haver, who is also allowed to buy the vehicle after a stipulated time.\n\nThe development has already sparked public scrutiny, with critics demanding clarity on the source of funds and whether the purchase was accounted for in the 2025 national budget.\n\nObservers warn Zimbabwe is increasingly resembling a mafia-style economy where political elites distribute vehicles and perks like candy to loyalists and strategic allies in order to cling to power.\n\n",
