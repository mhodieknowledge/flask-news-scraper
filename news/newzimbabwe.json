The midfielder has become a key figure at Molineux, particularly following the departure of last seasons star man, Matheus Cunha, to Manchester United.\n\nDespite the cup success, Wolves have endured one of their worst starts in Premier League history, losing all five of their opening league matches. They now turn their attention to a tough weekend fixture away to Tottenham in London.\n\n",

The group achieved an 18% growth in overall sales volume, with food sales up 18%, driven by strong yoghurt and tomato sauce sales, Chiromo said.\n\nNational raw milk production also increased by 3.9% year-on-year, from 55.1 million litres to 57.3 million litres.\n\nDZLs beverages segment surged by 28%, buoyed by exceptional performances from Pfuko and Cascade, alongside a recovery in tea due to improved availability.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has ordered Arosume Property Development (Pvt) Ltd to be joined in a bitter property dispute involving businesswoman Farai Olivia Mashonganyika and the Minister of Local Government, ruling that the developer has a direct and substantial interest in the contested Carrick Creagh land.\n\nDelivering judgment on September 5, 2025, Justice Siyabona Musithu said, The applicant not only has a substantial interest in the issues raised in HCH 884/24 concerning the property, but the applicants rights in the said property will be affected by any judgment that may be rendered without its involvement.\n\nHe said that excluding Arosume from the ongoing litigation would risk an incomplete determination of the matter.\n\nRule 32(12) bestows upon the court the discretion to order any person whose presence before the court is necessary to ensure that all issues in dispute may be effectually and completely determined, he said.\n\nThe case centres on stand 91 Kidron Valley Road, Carrick Creagh Estate, Borrowdale, transferred to Mashonganyika under Deed of Transfer 5690/2011. In 2022, the Ministry of Local Government moved to cancel her title deed, accusing her of failing to pay over US$520,195 in development costs and claiming she was not a member of the Sally Mugabe Housing Cooperative, which was part of the project.\n\nArosume, the developer in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) with the State and the cooperative, argued it was deliberately excluded when Mashonganyika filed a review application challenging the ministrys cancellation order. The firm alleged that the deed was fraudulently obtained and that it had already filed an urgent application to block Mashonganyika from building on the land.\n\nMashonganyika, however, insists she bought the property legitimately in 2011, paying US$4,000 directly to the ministry after previously being misled by Arosume to part with US$10,000. She maintains the government acted unlawfully by cancelling her deed without a court order.\n\nA deed of transfer confers real rights of ownership which cannot be terminated without a court order, she argued in her opposing affidavit.\n\nShe further accused the ministry of acting at Arosumes behest, alleging connivance between the developer and government to wrestle away her property.\n\nJustice Musithu dismissed her objections, finding that Arosumes interest arose from the tripartite PPP agreement governing Carrick Creagh. He noted that Mashonganyika herself had acknowledged the existence of a dispute with the developer in earlier court filings.\n\nThe dispute is much broader than the mere administrative process that the first respondent claims she wants regularised, the judge said. Any judgment affecting the property will also impact the developers rights under the tripartite arrangement.\n\nThe court granted Arosumes joinder, directing the company to file its opposing papers in the main matter (HCH 884/24) within five days. The question of costs was deferred to that case.\n\nThe ruling paves the way for a full trial in which the High Court will weigh competing claims of fraud, non-payment, and unlawful cancellation in one of Harares most high-profile land battles.\n\n",

There is palpable prosperity being delivered to Zimbabwe and the membership of ZANU PF is happy with that man. They have not seen anything to blemish him. They say if it aint broke, do not fix it.

It is not good for that member. I am not talking to him, I am talking about people who are urging him on.\n\nTo survive a war is a matter of lucky and once you survive and you begin to see virtue in yourself then you are not respecting those who you left behind. We never fought the war as generals. We fought as commanders.

His co-accused, Mthulisi Moyo, was acquitted for lack of evidence.\n\nAll the deceased had done was ask that you give away a monkey. He died because of such a flimsy reason, Justice Kabasa said in her ruling. Why would one use a lethal weapon to stab a human being several times and aim at vital organs if the intention is not to kill?\n\nThe court dismissed Sizibas claim of self-defence, pointing out that the victim was fleeing when attacked.\n\nA person fleeing is no danger to anyone. The ones pursuing are the danger to the one fleeing. What self-defence is that when the victim is attacked from the back?\n\nThe judge condemned the growing use of knives in violent disputes among artisanal miners.\n\nThe use of knives is becoming worrisome and gold panners appear to take knives as the weapon of choice. People ought to respect the sanctity of life. Life is a gift which ought not to be taken away at the hands of another.\n\nSiziba, who left the victim to bleed to death by a riverbank and lied that he was alright, showed no remorse, the court said.\n\nHanding down sentence, Justice Kabasa stressed that deterrence was necessary.\n\nAt 21 you are not so young to deserve a reduction of an otherwise appropriate sentence. There was nothing youthful in your conduct. The presumptive penalty is 20 years. We find no reason to depart from that.\n\nSiziba was jailed for 20 years, while Moyo walked free after being given the benefit of the doubt.\n\n",

Fellow G7 states Germany and Italy were also absent.\n\nBelgium, Luxembourg, Malta, Andorra and San Marino are also due to recognise a Palestinian state, after the UK, Canada, Australia and Portugal announced recognition on Sunday.\n\nInternational pressure is ramping up on Israel over the unfolding humanitarian crisis in Gaza and settlement building in the West Bank.\n\nIsrael has said recognition would reward Hamas for the Palestinian armed groups 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken hostage.\n\nMore than 65,000 Palestinians have been killed by Israel since, according to Gazas Hamas-run health ministry. Israeli forces are currently carrying out a ground offensive aimed at taking control of Gaza City, where a million people were living and a famine was confirmed last month.\n\nThe French leader told the conference that the time had come to stop the war and free the remaining Israeli hostages held by Hamas. He warned against the peril of endless wars and said right must always prevail over might.\n\nThe international community had failed to build a just and lasting peace in the Middle East, he said, adding that we must do everything in our power to preserve the possibility of a two-state solution that would see Israel and Palestine side by side in peace and security.\n\nSaudi Arabias Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud also addressed the UN, on behalf of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.\n\nHe reiterated that a two-state solution was the only way to achieve lasting peace in the region.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the EU would set up a new financial instrument to work on Gazas reconstruction.\n\nWe must all do more, she told the UN General Assembly. This is why we will set up a Palestine Donor Group.\n\nUN secretary general Antonio Guterres referred to the situation in Gaza as morally, legally and politically intolerable and said a two-state solution was the only credible path for peace between Israelis and Palestinians.\n\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas  who was blocked from attending the UN General Assembly in person after the US revoked his and other Palestinian officials visas  addressed the conference via videolink.\n\nHe called for a permanent ceasefire and said Hamas could have no role in governing Gaza, calling for the group to surrender their weapons to the Palestinian Authority (PA).\n\nWhat we want is one unified state without weapons, he said.\n\nAbbas also condemned Hamass 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel and addressed Israelis, saying: Our future and yours depends on peace. Enough violence and war.\n\nReuters Israel has been bombarding Gaza City as its forces push deeper into the city\n\nMacron said France was ready to contribute to a stabilisation mission in Gaza and called for a transitional administration involving the PA that would oversee the dismantling of Hamas.\n\nHe said France would only open an embassy to a Palestinian state when all the hostages being held by Hamas are released and a ceasefire had been agreed.\n\nIsraels ambassador to the UN, Danny Dannon, spoke to reporters shortly before Macrons announcement.\n\nDannon said a two-state solution was taken off the table after the 7 October attack and called this weeks talks at the UN a charade. He also refused to rule out Israel annexing the occupied West Bank.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has insisted there will be no Palestinian state to the west of the River Jordan, and President Isaac Herzog said recognising one would only embolden the forces of darkness.\n\nAhead of Macrons announcement, the Palestinian and Israeli flags were displayed on the Eiffel Tower on Sunday night. A number of town halls in France also flew Palestinian flags on Monday, despite a government order to local prefects to maintain neutrality.\n\nPro-Palestinian protests also took place in some80 towns and cities across Italy, where Giorgia Melonis government said recently it could be counter-productive to recognise a state that did not exist.\n\nIn Germany, the government has said Palestinian statehood is not currently up for debate, and Foreign Minister Johann Wadephul explained as he left for New York on Monday that, For Germany, recognition of a Palestinian state comes more at the end of the process. But this process must begin now.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nUS comedian Jimmy Kimmel will return to his late-night talk show on Tuesday after he was suspended for making jokes relating to the death of conservative influencer Charlie Kirk.\n\nDisney, which owns the US broadcast network that airs Jimmy Kimmel Live, said on Monday that it suspended the show because it felt some of the comments were ill-timed and thus insensitive.\n\nWe have spent the last days having thoughtful conversations with Jimmy, and after those conversations, we reached the decision to return the show on Tuesday, Disney said.\n\nThe comics abrupt suspension came after threats by the federal tv regulator to revoke ABCs broadcast licence, sparking nationwide debates over free speech.\n\nUS President Donald Trump had welcomed Kimmels suspension and suggested that some TV networks should havetheir licences taken awayfor negative coverage of the president.\n\nTrump did not address Kimmels reinstatement when a reporter asked about it during a White House event on Monday.\n\nSinclair, the largest ABC affiliate group in the US, said on Monday it will replace Jimmy Kimmel Live! with news programming across its ABC affiliate stations from Tuesday.\n\nDiscussions with ABC are ongoing as we evaluate the shows potential return, it added.\n\nSinclair previously called Kimmels remarks inappropriate and deeply insensitive at a critical moment for our country and said it would not lift the suspension before having formal discussions with ABC.\n\nNexstar Media, one of the biggest owners of TV stations in the US, also said last week it would not air Kimmels show for the foreseeable future. It has not yet commented on Kimmels reinstatement.\n\nCritics and First Amendment advocates railed against ABCs decision last week as censorship and a violation of free speech.\n\nKimmel, who has hosted the late-night programme since 2003 and hosted four Oscars ceremonies, has not yet publicly addressed the suspension or the fallout.\n\nThe row started after Kimmel said in his monologue on 15 September that the Maga gang were desperately trying to characterise this kid who murdered Charlie Kirk as anything other than one of them and trying to score political points from it.\n\nHe also made fun of Trumps reaction to the influencers murder, showing a clip of the president responding to a question about how he was mourning the death by changing the subject to construction of a new White House ballroom.\n\nKimmel compared the response to how a four-year-old mourns a goldfish.\n\nBrendan Carr, the Trump-appointed chair of broadcast regulator theFederal Communications Commission (FCC), threatened to act against ABC and its parent company Disney over Kimmels remarks.\n\nThe spat comes as Vice President JD Vance and other White House allies have been pushing a national campaign to punish anyone who has criticised Kirk in the wake of his death.\n\nHours after Mr Carr made his initial remarks about Kimmels monologue, Nexstar said it would not air Kimmels show for the foreseeable future.\n\nSinclair followed suit and ABC announced that it would indefinitely suspend the programme and demanded an apology from Kimmel, as well as a donation to Kirks non-profit organization Turning Point USA.\n\nMr Carr thanked Nexstar for doing the right thing and said he hoped other broadcasters would follow its lead. Nexstar is currently seeking FCC approval for its planned $6.2bn (4.5bn) merger with Tegna.\n\nAnna Gomez, the sole Democrat on the FCC, said on Monday that she was glad to see Disney find its courage in the face of clear government intimidation.\n\nMs Gomez also thanked Americans across the ideological spectrum who protested this blatant attempt to silence free speech and vowed to combat these efforts to stifle free expression.\n\nABCs decisionto suspend Kimmelwas met with protests in California and lambasted by the writers and actors guilds, lawmakers and the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) alike, who argued that the suspension violates free speech rights and spurs a chilling effect.\n\nKimmels late-night colleagues, including Jon Stewart, John Oliver and outgoing CBS host Stephen Colbert, rallied behind him and hundreds of celebrities and Hollywood creativessigned on to a letterbacking Kimmel.\n\nBen Stiller, Jennifer Aniston, Meryl Streep and Robert DeNiro are among those who called Kimmels suspension a dark moment for freedom of speech in our nation.\n\nCritics have also called for the cancellation of Disney+, Hulu and other Disney-owned subscription services to cut into the entertainment conglomerates bottom line over it decision to suspend Kimmel.\n\n",
