They then went into a room and the accused person then went out and returned at around midnight.\n\nThe accused person asked her to have sexual intercourse with him, and she refused and told him that she was tired.\n\nProsecutors alleged Chidziva then pleaded with the teen, promising her a job outside Zimbabwe and she complied.\n\nThe 16-year-old then returned to Ushewokunze, where she was chased away by her friends mother because she had not slept at home the previous night.\n\nThe court heard that she then went and stayed with her cousin in Budiriro 1, but her aunt had already filed a missing persons report at Budiriro Police Station.\n\nShe later presented herself to the police, where she narrated her ordeal leading to Chidzivas arrest.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nSkeem Saam knows how to grip viewers with a storyline and the latest revolving around the adulterous affair of DJ Thomas and Mapitsi Maputla has been no different.\n\nThe pair, both radio presenters at Berry FM, have been entangled in an illicit relationship. The twist? Mapitsi is a married woman and her husband, Tbose, has no idea whats been going on behind the scenes.\n\nThat is, until the affair was accidentally exposed, live on air, thanks to Kamos meddling.\n\nIn an interview with IOL Entertainment, the actors behind the characters Tiisetso Thoka andMogau Keebine, shared that when they first read the script of how their characters secret would be exposed, had quite a reaction.\n\nI immediately had goosebumps thinking of the aftermath, said Thoka.\n\nIt meant the whole of Turf would know about the affair and the chances of Thomas losing his radio gig were high.\n\nKeebine was just as shocked and worried about how the characters would recover from such a huge blow, being exposed on the whole community radio station.\n\nIt was a very exciting time to be reading the script I was shocked and I was also very proud of how the writers just didnt go the conventional route of, you know, them being caught in the act, they exposed themselves, said Keebine.\n\nThe storyline was a challenge for both actors and they both prepared for it by reading up on scenarios on how people felt or reacted when they were caught cheating or when they caught their partner cheating.\n\nFor Keebine, who is married in real life, the storyline brought personal challenges. She had to prepare her family ahead of the episodes, reassuring them that it was all just a role. She also admitted she disagreed with her characters actions.\n\nI had to put my feelings about what Mapitsi and Thomas were doing aside and play the role of a broken-hearted, lonely, married woman with two kids who was finding affection from someone else.\n\nThe radio station setting added an element of pressure on the characters they had to act professionally when on air, even on days they were not getting along off-air. Eventually it put so much pressure on the affair because of our fights, said Thoka.\n\nMapitsi is already dealing with the pressures of her personal life. When herhusband Tbosecame back from overseas, it wasnt all smooth sailing, he didnt find her attractive, her wardrobe choices.\n\nHe was kind of almost borderline agreeing with the listenership of the radio station, and you put that together with having just been pregnant and having had a baby, explains Keebine.\n\nTheres insecurities about weight and physical appearance, and theres obviously like a disconnect between Mapitsi and Tbose an emotional disconnect between them at the time.\n\nI guess, you know, Thomas came in at a time when Mapitsi was very emotionally vulnerable and feeling lonely in her relationship.\n\nThe radio stations audiences emphasise on appearance after having a baby was an added pressure.\n\nI think the main pressure came from what was happening in her personal life because I think if Mapitsi had felt more reassured and more connected to Tbose as her husband, things probably wouldnt have gotten to where they did, said Keebine.\n\nAudiences have been loving the storyline, many have been waiting for the day DJ Thomas and Mapitsi get caught.\n\nOn Facebook, posts about the storyline have been flooded with comments, and on the week of the big expose May 12  16, the median rating pull was around 3.7 million viewers and Fridays fiery episode pulled around 4.3 million.\n\nThoka reveals that the real-life audience reactions have been crazy. Its funny how most people take this seriously and think its real life. More than 50 people have approached him and told him how disgusted they are by what he is doing with Mapitsi.\n\nIm used to handling such situations because its not the first time it has happened. Mostly, I avoid going out in the public, he said.\n\nThrough social media, Keebine got mixed reactions to Mapitsi cheating, from women understanding where the character was coming from and disappointment from men, who were hurt by their respectable Makotis change of ways.\n\nThere was a huge group of other women who were like, we cannot wait to see Mapitsis downfall when all of this is revealed, because I am not representing women well.\n\nI liked that as much as, you know, its not nice to hear about the character that youre playing, but I like that women are standing up for their character as women and saying that, no, we are not like this. This is a bad representation of most of us, even though it is what happens.\n\nThe adulterous storyline is not without lessons, Keebine says it reminds us that it will always end in tears.\n\nBe careful, tread lightly, and also be aware of your emotional state, so that you dont fall into the trap of unintentionally catching feelings for someone who youre not supposed to be looking at in that kind of way, from Mapitsis perspective, said Keebine.\n\nYou cant expect a person to be the way you envision them to be according to your expectations. Human beings have feelings and make mistakes too, adds Thoka. But it also tells us about the results of those mistakes. How your decisions can alter your life so drastically.\n\nAs the scandal continues to unfold, viewers remain glued to their screens, wondering: Will Mapitsi andTbosereconcile? Will DJ Thomas still go through with paying Lobola for his girlfriend? And will the listeners of Berry FM and the people of Turfloop, ever forget what happened live on air?\n\n",

Mudenda said.\n\n",
