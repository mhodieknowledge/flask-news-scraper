The projected surplus will continue to be supported by improvements in merchandise exports and remittances, he said.\n\nThe MPS shows that the financial soundness metrics indicate that the banking sector is safe and sound despite some issues of prudential concern at a few institutions.\n\nAs at June 30, 2025, 17 out of 19 banking institutions reported core capital above the minimum regulatory capital requirements and the non-performing loans ratio stood at 2.89% compared to 3.37% as at 31 December 2024.\n\nOfficial records also show that during the same period, remittances rose to US$635,2 million signaling a 7,1% increase compared to the same period last year.\n\nTo year end, remittances are projected to increase by 4.9% from US$2.6 billion in 2024 to US$2.7 billion in 2025, sustaining a positive current account balance. Given the strategic importance of the diaspora community, the Government seeks to strengthen their role in the development of the country.\n\n",

While in college, I launched a movie business through a deal with my university, which ignited my passion for entrepreneurship.\n\nDuring my industrial work experience, I started a condiments buying and selling business that eventually grew to the point of exporting to Zambia. After college, I briefly worked at Telecel, TelOne, and Zuva Petroleum in various managerial roles.\n\nThe leaders at TelOne and Zuva greatly influenced my development as a manager and leader, and I am grateful for their mentorship. My wife, who is also my business partner, has played a significant role in my journey. I am a firm believer in God, and I recognise that I wouldnt be where I am today without His mercy.\n\nQN:Walk us through how you launched your businesses and what inspired the journey.\n\nRM:I started my first business while in college by seizing a unique opportunity to run a movie venture. This experience taught me the importance of innovation and calculated risks. On industrial attachment at Dairibord, I started buying and selling condiments from work and exporting to Zambia.\n\nMy condiments business later flourished, allowing me to reinvest and explore further opportunities in education and technology, which ultimately led me to energy and the construction and real estate sectors, where I recognised significant potential to do much more across Africa.\n\nQN: What has managed to sustain your firms in this difficult economic environment?\n\nRM:Our resilience is rooted in our commitment to quality and innovation. We embrace learning and quickly adapt to change. By identifying the critical need for housing and infrastructure in Zimbabwe, we have focused on developing clusters and high-rise flats that maximise space and align with market demands. This strategic focus has enabled us to thrive even in challenging economic conditions.\n\nQN: You have expanded outside of the country. How has that experience been, and how are the firms performing abroad?\n\nRM:Expanding beyond Zimbabwe has been a rewarding experience, allowing us to tap into new markets and diversify our portfolio. Our firms abroad are performing well as we adapt our strategies to local needs while maintaining the high standards weve established. The Chartered Institute of Customer Management is now operating in 13 countries across Africa.\n\nQN: Your portfolio spans construction (Picco), education, energy, and more. How do you identify opportunities across such diverse sectors, and whats your strategy for scaling them?\n\nRM:Identifying opportunities across diverse sectors requires a keen understanding of market dynamics and trends. My previous work experience informs many of my ventures.\n\nI focus on thorough research and analysis to pinpoint market gaps. My strategy for scaling involves building strong partnerships, nurturing relationships, leveraging technology, and maintaining a customer-centric approach to meet the evolving needs of our clients.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Labour Court has dismissed an appeal by Watershed College Trust against an arbitral award in favour of a former probationary teacher, ruling that the institution clearly aprobated and reprobated its contractual obligations and acted unlawfully by issuing notice of termination after the expiration of the probation period.\n\nIn a judgment delivered by Justice Samuel Kudya, the court found that while the arbitrator erred in concluding that the teacher, Jenipha Madziva, had become a permanent employee, the substantive award of damages for unfair dismissal remained valid.\n\nWatershed College Trust had challenged the arbitrators ruling on five grounds, including the claim that Madziva was erroneously classified as a permanent employee and that damages were improperly awarded in US dollars. However, Justice Kudya found that only one of the grounds had merit and upheld the rest of the arbitrators findings.\n\nThe employer clearly aprobated and reprobated by writing in the probation contract that it did not intend to extend it, yet it was doing exactly that which it said it did not intend to do, the judge ruled.\n\nThe dispute arose when the school employed Madziva on a fixed-term probation contract, which was due to expire on 31 March 2023.\n\nOn that very day, the school issued a notice stating it would not be extending her contract.\n\nThe arbitrator ruled that this amounted to unlawful termination and awarded damages, prompting the appeal.\n\nKudya criticised the colleges handling of the matter, stating, Had the employer indeed intended to give notice for the termination of the probation contract, it should have done so before its expiration.  It was not remiss for the arbitrator to conclude that once parties were in the April to December phase of the contract, they were now operating in the main contract.\n\nHe added that the colleges attempt to treat the contract as terminated while simultaneously letting it roll into the next phase of employment cannot pass the unreasonableness test laid out in Hama v NRZ.\n\nOn the matter of prejudice, the court noted that unfair dismissal need not be measured by harm suffered.\n\nPrejudice is indeed not a prerequisite to find unlawful termination, Kudya said, affirming the arbitrators position that the dismissal was inherently unfair.\n\nAddressing the employers objection to the damages awarded in US dollars, the court reaffirmed Zimbabwes multi-currency framework.\n\nThere was nothing remiss by making the order which the arbitrator made.  If the employer wants to pay what was ordered using the rate of the local currency at the date of payment, nothing stops it from doing so.\n\nThe judge further dismissed the employers contention that the arbitrator had wrongly quantified the damages.\n\nIt was unnecessary to try to find out what was due when it was apparent on the contract. The res ipsa loquitur principle applies.\n\nThe judge upheld the appeal relating to the employees classification as permanent.\n\nHe ruled that the arbitral award stands, but with the correction that Madziva was not a permanent employee.\n\nWatershed College Trust was ordered to pay costs on the ordinary scale.\n\n",
