Cde Tagwirei is a party member in Harare Metropolitan Province. He is a strategist in business. He is a visionary business leader.\n\nSo, the proposal was put forward by members of the Central Committee, and the PCC unanimously agreed to recommend him for co-option into the Central Committee of ZANU PF. We are going to submit this recommendation to the partys Secretary-General, Dr Obert Mpofu, as the official position from Harare Province, said Masimirembwa.\n\nTagwirei has been accused of benefiting from his close ties to Mnangagwa through lucrative government contracts.\n\nHe secured a multimillion-dollar deal to construct the Mbudzi Interchange flyover and has expanded his business empire into mining while maintaining a near-monopoly in the fuel sector.\n\nTagwirei has been leading the Command Agriculture programme and currently chairs the Land Tenure Implementation Committee.\n\nMasimirembwa added that Tagwirei has been a staunch supporter of the ruling party.\n\nCde Tagwirei has been supporting the party, and this is the time for him to participate from within, particularly in championing economic empowerment, he said.\n\nTagwirei has also been at the centre of threats from militant war veteran Blessed Geza, who has accused him of being an oligarch.\n\n",

He said the introduction of new tax regulations, a restrictive monetary policy framework, and exchange rate volatility choked the smooth flow of operations.\n\nThe introduction of the Zimbabwe Gold currency in April initially stabilized both the exchange rates and inflation. However, by September 2024, rapid depreciation led to substantial devaluation, causing pricing distortions within formal trade that stifled performance, he said.\n\nHe said the introduction of the sugar content surtax fiscal policy adjustments, including the VAT reclassification of milk products, and the increased Intermediated Money Transfer Tax (IMTT) on US$ transactions, resulted in significant cost increases.\n\nThis necessitated price increases, particularly across the beverages portfolio, that negatively impacted competitiveness and consumer demand. Consequently, a price rollback to pre-surtax pr pricing was implemented, leading to margin erosion.\n\nOperational inefficiencies stemming from inconsistent availability of utilities increased production costs and disrupted output while supply chain challenges hindered material procurement, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, during the period, the group achieved a consolidated volume growth of 10% driven by a strong performance in the Liquid Milks and Foods categories, though constrained by a marginal 1% growth in Beverages.\n\nThe liquid milks 20% significant year-over-year growth was due to an increased raw milk supply, with notable market share gains across Chimombe, Steri and Lacto. Food sales volumes rose 47%, led by Yummy yoghurt and ice cream, while improved product availability bolstered Rabroy Tomato Sauce sales.\n\nBeverages realized only 1 % growth, impacted by subdued Pfuko Maheu performance due to pricing challenges from sugar tax and VAT adjustments. US$ sales volume rose to 83% of total volume, up from 79% in the corresponding prior year period.\n\nThe group continues to navigate a complex and volatile environment characterized by evolving regulatory policies and currency fluctuations. High input costs, an onerous tax burden and pricing pressures remain key challenges, added Sachikonye.\n\n",
