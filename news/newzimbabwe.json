            "content": "AP\n\nThe program known as PEPFAR is one of the most effective and popular U.S. foreign aid projects in history, and the government says it has saved the lives of over 25 million people around the world with HIV.\n\nBut despite years of bipartisan support, PEPFAR has faced a severe threat as the Trump administration dismantles most U.S. foreign aid.\n\nPEPFAR on Tuesday appeared to be spared a $400 million cut as Republicans acted in rare defiance of a request by President Donald Trump. But governments, health experts and people with HIV around the world are alarmed by the effects of other U.S. aid cuts and chaos that are already disrupting the crucial supply of HIV drugs  which are meant to be taken daily.\n\nHeres a look at PEPFAR and how it affects millions of people globally.\n\nToday, many babies are born infection-free to mothers with HIV  the U.S. State Department says PEPFAR has been responsible for 5.5 million such births  and most people around the world no longer see an infection as a death sentence.\n\nGovernments in Africa and elsewhere had even begun to worry about complacency as people, especially youths, took the widespread availability of HIV drugs for granted. In another significant step forward, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved for use the worlds only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV.\n\nBut the abrupt U.S. aid cuts have health officials in developing countries warning of a return to the early days of the AIDS pandemic, when drugs were nonexistent or severely limited and clinics were filled with the dying. PEPFAR was launched in 2004 in response to those grim scenes.\n\nAlso known as the U.S. Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the program has partnered with nonprofit groups to provide HIV medication  including the preventative PrEP  to millions around the world. It has strengthened national health care systems, cared for children orphaned by AIDS and provided job training for people at risk. It has played an important role in testing for and tracking HIV infections.\n\nHIV/AIDS has no cure, and it has killed over 40 million people globally over the years. Now the U.N. agency on AIDS is warning that analysis suggests 4 million additional AIDS-related deaths between now and 2029, including 300,000 additional childrens deaths, if programs permanently lose PEPFARs support.\n\nSince PEPFARs creation by Congress and Republican President George W. Bush, the program has largely enjoyed support across the political spectrum  and gratitude from countries whose health systems have been poorly equipped to care for millions with HIV.\n\nBut misinformation has crept in. The Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative Washington think tank, accused the Biden administration of using PEPFAR to promote its domestic radical social agenda overseas. Conservatives claimed there were efforts to integrate abortion with HIV/AIDS prevention, a claim the Biden administration denied. Similar claims linger under the Trump administration.\n\nTrump and his officials also claim widespread waste and fraud as they seek to dismantle U.S. foreign aid. But PEPFAR has been repeatedly scrutinized. Last year, the government said the State Departments Office of Inspector General had conducted 80 audits, inspections, and special reviews that included oversight of PEPFAR programs, including 21 thematic reviews and audits specifically focused on PEPFAR.\n\nThe $400 million proposed cut to PEPFAR still could be restored, in part or in full, as the bill on spending cuts faces a final vote in the Senate, a vote in the House of Representatives and Trumps signature before a Friday deadline.\n\nWe must stay vigilant, International AIDS Society President Beatriz Grinsztejn said in a statement Wednesday after PEPFAR appeared to be spared.\n\nNo matter what, countries and health experts say it will be impossible to fill the funding gap left by the overall U.S. withdrawal of billions of dollars in aid for the global HIV response, including via PEPFAR.\n\nLast month, a UNAIDS report said the abrupt cuts have destabilized supply chains, led to the closure of health facilities, left thousands of health clinics without staff, set back prevention programs, disrupted HIV testing efforts and forced many community organizations to reduce or halt their HIV activities.\n\nSouth Africa, where more people live with HIV than anywhere else in the world, has said 12 specialized HIV clinics that were funded by the U.S. have had to close down and over 8,000 health workers in its national HIV program are out of work.\n\nNow health workers there and elsewhere are trying to track down an unknown number of people who have lost access to HIV medication. The stakes are deadly. Stopping the drugs allows the virus to start multiplying again. HIV can rebound to detectable levels in peoples blood in just a few weeks, putting sexual partners at risk. The virus could even become drug-resistant.\n\nIt has really been hectic for us, said Mbonisiwe Hlongwane, manager of the HIV program at the Bertha Gxowa public hospital in Germiston, east of Johannesburg. And the uncertainty only continues.\n\n",

Our appeal suspends the High Court Ruling. He then insists that the party has no leader but if we are to implement the High Court ruling it means the default position is that we fall back to the Extraordinary Congress position.\n\nWhere Senator Mwonzora was elected President and Komichi returns his chairman position and Mudzuri as Deputy National chairman, but unfortunately, Komichi has already formed his party so automatically he has lost his right to return his position, said Damba.\n\nMudzuri and other disgruntled MDC-T members won their court challenge seeking to nullify Mwonzoras 2022 election as party leader. The High Court ordered the MDC-T to return to pre-election structures and convene an extraordinary congress. Mwonzora has since filed an appeal with the Supreme Court.\n\nDamba said Mudzuris latest actions were disruptive, coinciding with the Epworth by-election campaign.\n\nUnfortunately, our case us still before the courts and please note that it is not us who approached the courts but its them, so we are simply pursuing the legal route that they initiated.\n\nUnfortunately, Mudzuri is so wayward that he called for a press conference today, and nobody knows what he wanted to announce.\n\nThe MDC is a party with a constitution and all meetings are structured around certain office bearers, not the chaotic manner in which he wants to do it and he decided to do it at a time we are campaigning in Epworth North Ward 6 By Election. He intends to disrupt our by-election campaign so that Zanu-PF wins the seat, said Damba.\n\n",

Revenue decline was contained at 9,1% over the prior year, at USD30.7 million against USD33.7 million in 2023, the group said.\n\nThe company said the operating environment for the year ended 5 January 2025 was characterised by exchange rate volatility and incessant inflationary pressures on the back of liquidity challenges in both the local and foreign currencies, which persisted throughout the year.\n\nThe impact of the El Nio-induced drought in the 2023/2024 agricultural season, the worst in the last 43 years, resulted in below-average agricultural output. That, combined with retrenchments reported across various sectors, especially in retail branches, negatively impacted disposable incomes, resulting in subdued sales volumes during the period, compared to the prior year, the group said.\n\nGoing forward, management intends to right-align business overheads to attain volumes in the context of depressed demand and float flexible credit offerings, which will be maintained to stimulate increased expenditure.\n\nThe Group will continue to expand its geographic footprint through the opening of new stores in strategic locations.
