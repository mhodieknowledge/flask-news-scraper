            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nERIC Niyonsaba, a Ugandan national and businessman, has demanded retraction of articles on popular site Bus Stop TV and Zim Times, both of which accused him of harbouring and financing Rwandese Intelligence Service operatives killing suspects of the 1994 genocide.\n\nNiyonsaba, who owns Fresh Kambucha Zimbabwe, gave the two publications 12 hours to act, in letters sent on May 23 by his lawyer Admire Rubaya.Failure, he said, will result in his client instituting legal proceedings, to get managers of both publications arrested and prosecuted for malicious damage to his clients image and that of his company.The letter was also copied to Police Commissioner General Stephen Mutamba.Circumstances are that the two produced a report indicating Niyonsaba as one of many Ugandan nationals running cover companies, including tuckshops, that were financing Rwandan secret service operatives in an operation targeting suspects of the world infamous 1994 genocide.The article was titled Kagame intelligence agents allegedly involved in killings of genocide suspects in Zimbabwe.The statement that you published on your website is defamatory and was understood by a reasonable reader, follower or social media user that our client is an illicit business which is a front for the Rwandan Intelligence services which houses terrorists and criminals who are killing people allegedly connected to the Rwanda 1994 genocide, said Rubaya in the letter.You have actively discouraged your followers and other social media users from purchasing the product (Fresh Kambucha), thereby potentially harming our clients reputation and business interests.He has no connection whatsoever to the Rwandan Intelligence Services or any of the individuals that you alleged he works with to fund the alleged extra judicial killings.He does not house any terrorists who are allegedly conducting the alleged extra judicial killings and that he is not involved in spying for the Rwandan Intelligence Services.Further allegations that Fresh Kambucha had not undergone rigorous tests to prove its safety, were said to have significantly affected Niyonsabas business.Added Rubaya: Our client has a traceable record of clean and well manufactured Kambucha drinks, which have been scientifically tested to the extent that no adverse report has been authored by the relevant authorities.Our client is a genuine international investor who originates from the great country of Uganda, which is led by the African son Yoweri Kaguta Museveni. He is lawfully in Zimbabwe and is just but a pure businessman who is creating employment for Zimbabweans and contributing to the national fiscus.Our clients reputation has been severely damaged and now on the verge of losing many lucrative contracts and has the real risk of being declared the enemy of the peace-loving Zimbabwean government and being called a person of interest by the Zimbabwean law enforcement agents.We enjoin you to take these allegations seriously, failing which you will only have yourselves to blame.In the event that you fail to retract the defamatory statement as demanded our client shall proceed to issue summons and claim damages for defamation as well as lodge a criminal complaint against those who run the website and/or your social media pages without any further notice to you.\n\nNiyonsaba, who owns Fresh Kambucha Zimbabwe, gave the two publications 12 hours to act, in letters sent on May 23 by his lawyer Admire Rubaya.\n\nFailure, he said, will result in his client instituting legal proceedings, to get managers of both publications arrested and prosecuted for malicious damage to his clients image and that of his company.The letter was also copied to Police Commissioner General Stephen Mutamba.Circumstances are that the two produced a report indicating Niyonsaba as one of many Ugandan nationals running cover companies, including tuckshops, that were financing Rwandan secret service operatives in an operation targeting suspects of the world infamous 1994 genocide.The article was titled Kagame intelligence agents allegedly involved in killings of genocide suspects in Zimbabwe.The statement that you published on your website is defamatory and was understood by a reasonable reader, follower or social media user that our client is an illicit business which is a front for the Rwandan Intelligence services which houses terrorists and criminals who are killing people allegedly connected to the Rwanda 1994 genocide, said Rubaya in the letter.You have actively discouraged your followers and other social media users from purchasing the product (Fresh Kambucha), thereby potentially harming our clients reputation and business interests.He has no connection whatsoever to the Rwandan Intelligence Services or any of the individuals that you alleged he works with to fund the alleged extra judicial killings.He does not house any terrorists who are allegedly conducting the alleged extra judicial killings and that he is not involved in spying for the Rwandan Intelligence Services.Further allegations that Fresh Kambucha had not undergone rigorous tests to prove its safety, were said to have significantly affected Niyonsabas business.Added Rubaya: Our client has a traceable record of clean and well manufactured Kambucha drinks, which have been scientifically tested to the extent that no adverse report has been authored by the relevant authorities.Our client is a genuine international investor who originates from the great country of Uganda, which is led by the African son Yoweri Kaguta Museveni.

attempting to fraudulently takeover his company.\n\nClark and Beverly Makoni have dismissed all allegations and maintained that witnesses being brought forward against them were using hearsay evidence.The two have now demanded appearance of Gono as a star witness, whom they say is the only one who knows what happened on the day they entered into an agreement.He is expected to make an appearance on June 13, 2025.None of the witnesses that have been presented at court has indicated any knowledge of the relationship between the complainant and defendant.The State said it will lead evidence from Investigating Officer Eric Chacha before closing its case.On Friday, the State brought in Fadzai Chiro, a former accountant at Valley Lodge, the business in question, who stated that the two parties were managing the business.She said she had never met Beverly and had only seen her in court for the first time.The State alleges that the couple forged a CR14 form in which Clark appointed himself director and company secretary and Beverly as his deputy.It is also alleged that they misrepresented to the bank that they were the new shareholders and wanted to change signatories to bank accounts.The State alleges that the couple then fraudulently took over the complainants company and gained access to its bank accounts and stole the alleged money.The witness, Chiro, said she had no knowledge of the allegations and got to know about them when her statement was recorded.\n\nClark and Beverly Makoni have dismissed all allegations and maintained that witnesses being brought

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nDESPITE threats of termination of contracts, University of Zimbabwe (UZ) lecturers remain defiant, cranking up pressure on government and the institution to increase, tenfold, their salaries to US$2,500 per month.\n\nThe lecturers, who have been on industrial action for a month, are pressing ahead with picketing, vowing not to return to class until government accedes to their demand for an upward review of their paltry earnings.UZ administrators responded heavy-handedly, threatening to replace the striking lecturers, with reports indicating that the adjunct tutors would be earning US$3 per hour.The Association of University Teachers (AUT) spokesperson, Obvious Vengeyi, blasted UZ for failing to attract applications for the posts.It is true that the University of Zimbabwe has hired experts to replace the real experts, who are on a lawful and constitutional strike, demanding a restoration of their salary to pre-October 2018 rates, whereby a junior lecturer got US$2,250 per month before it was slashed to only US$230, which they are currently getting.The so-called experts are hired as adjunct lecturers. That means they are not replacing the real experts. It was the university administrations hope that they would get hundreds of them so that the university would return to normal business.Unfortunately, the experiment failed spectacularly. The whole university failed to attract more than 10 across all its 11 faculties. All 10 are not qualified to teach at high school. They were pulled from the streets and from churches. It is a joke, to say the least, said Vengeyi.Last week, UZ was further plunged into chaos after the Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) staged a flash demonstration, demanding the return of lecturers.The students criticised the UZ administration for pressing ahead with examinations when they had little lecture time. The striking lecturers have disassociated themselves from overseeing examinations.Vengeyi told NewZimbabwe.com that the situation at UZ is dire and might deteriorate if the institution and the parent government arm Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education  do not address their grievances.The university is paying only US$5.50 per hour. It is not even enough for transport and lunch. The AUT, therefore, did not see any reason to interfere with their process. The situation at UZ as of today is pathetic. There are no classes taking place until we receive US$2,250. That demand must be met.If that is not met, then there is no graduation this year. Block 4 should have started on Monday, 19 May, but it failed. Nothing is happening. Remember too that Block 3 failed.

extortion and criminal abuse of duty.\n\nThe trio is accused of soliciting bribes from two complainants in connection with the release of an impounded truck and to influence the proceedings of an ongoing criminal case.According to the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC), in March 2025, one complainant leased her truck for transporting agricultural goods from Honde Valley to Harare.On March 26, the truck was impounded by Tivafukidze and Masase, at a road block in Marara area on suspicion of transporting smuggled goods, said ZACC in a statement.The trucks cargo owners were also arrested at that time.After the incident, Chavarika, who was prosecuting the related case, allegedly contacted one of the complainants on April 3, summoning her to Hauna.There, Tivafukidze and Chavarika who are stationed at Mutasa Police Station allegedly demanded a US$500 bribe to secure the trucks release.The complainant initially paid US$170 in cash and then transferred an additional US$100 via Ecocash the following day.Despite assurances from Chavarika that the truck would be released by April 9, it was instead directed to the ZIMRA compound at Forbes Border Post.Further demands for an additional US$300 were allegedly made to secure the acquittal of the cargo owners detained during the initial incident.This prompted the complainants to report the alleged misconduct to ZACC.Following an undercover operation, the three officials were arrested at the Mutasa Magistrate Court, during which US$200 in cash was recovered from Chavarika.They have since appeared before Mutare Provincial Magistrate Enia Ndiraya and are currently out on US$100 bail each.Trial commences on June 5.\n\nThe trio is accused of soliciting bribes from two complainants in connection with the

            "content": "Hydroponics has revolutionized gardening and farming by eliminating the need for soil, allowing plants to grow faster, healthier, and more efficiently. At the heart of every successful hydroponic system lies a critical factor: hydroponic nutrients. These nutrient solutions are the life source for plants, replacing the traditional minerals and organic matter found in soil.\n\nUnderstanding hydroponic nutrients  how they work, how to manage them, and how to optimize their use  is key to achieving strong yields and healthy plants. Whether youre just starting with hydroponics or scaling up to a commercial setup, mastering nutrients is a must.\n\nIn hydroponic systems, plants depend entirely on the grower for their nutritional needs. Unlike traditional farming, where soil acts as a buffer and nutrient reservoir, hydroponics delivers nutrients directly through water. This direct delivery means plants absorb essential elements faster and more efficiently, leading to faster growth cycles andbigger harvests.\n\nHydroponic nutrients include a mix of macronutrients like nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), along with secondary elements such as calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. Trace minerals like iron, manganese, boron, and zinc are equally vital, supporting photosynthesis, cell structure, and root development.\n\nBy precisely controlling nutrient levels, growers can tailor feeding schedules to each plants growth stage, dramatically improving outcomes.\n\nNot all nutrient solutions are created equal. Some are designed for general use, while others are tailored for specific crops like leafy greens, herbs, or fruiting plants. The choice of nutrients also depends on the type of hydroponic system being used  for instance, deep water culture (DWC) systems often need slightly different nutrient balances than drip irrigation setups.\n\nBeginners often start withpre-formulated hydroponic nutrients, which offer balanced profiles for a range of plants. Advanced growers might customize their own blends to fine-tune nutrient delivery. Monitoring factors like electrical conductivity (EC) and pH ensures that plants are receiving exactly what they need without risking deficiencies or toxicities.\n\nGrowers serious about optimizing their setups often turn to top hydroponic nutrient techniques to maintain peak system performance and avoid common pitfalls.\n\nStarting with hydroponic nutrients can seem overwhelming at first, but it becomes second nature with practice. Beginners should focus on understanding three key aspects: nutrient types, concentration levels, and pH control.\n\nPre-mixed nutrient solutions specifically formulated for beginners offer a reliable starting point. Many are labeled according to plant type or growth stage (vegetative vs flowering), making selection easier. Monitoring pH is equally important, as incorrect levels can lock nutrients out, even if they are present in the solution.\n\nTo simplify the learning curve, new growers can explore guides likehydroponic nutrients for beginners, where step-by-step instructions make it easy to avoid mistakes and build strong foundational skills.\n\nMastering the basics early ensures a smoother, more productive journey into the world of hydroponic gardening.\n\nSuccessful hydroponic gardening doesnt stop at adding nutrients to water; it requires consistent monitoring and adjustments. EC meters and pH testing kits are essential tools for keeping nutrient solutions within the ideal range.\n\nAs plants absorb nutrients and water evaporates, concentrations can fluctuate. Without careful monitoring, plants may face nutrient deficiencies, stunted growth, or salt buildup in the system. Regularly checking solution strength, topping off water levels, and flushing systems, when necessary, ensures a stable environment for roots to thrive.\n\nAutomated nutrient dosing systems are becoming increasingly popular, especially for larger or commercial hydroponic operations. These smart systems help maintain ideal conditions with minimal manual effort.\n\nIncorporating hydroponic nutrient balance strategies into regular garden management improves long-term success and plant vitality.\n\nEven experienced growers can make errors when it comes to nutrients. Overfeeding, underfeeding, or failing to monitor pH can all lead to disappointing harvests. Recognizing the signs of imbalance  such as yellowing leaves, slow growth, or nutrient burn  is critical for quick intervention.\n\nOne useful strategy is implementing a simple feeding chart and adjusting based on plant response rather than blindly following general schedules. Also, regularly cleaning and sterilizing equipment prevents salt buildup and contamination, two often-overlooked nutrient management issues.\n\nHydroponic success isnt about having perfect systems from the start; its about observing plants, learning from each cycle, and refining techniques over time.\n\nTechnology is transforming how growers manage nutrients. Innovations like real-time nutrient monitors, AI-assisted dosing systems, and environmentally friendly nutrient sources are making hydroponic gardening more sustainable and scalable.\n\nAs hydroponic systems become smarter and more automated, the growers role evolves into that of a manager and optimizer. Learning hydroponic nutrient fundamentals today sets gardeners up for long-term success as these technologies become more widespread.\n\nBy understanding and mastering hydroponic nutrients now, growers position themselves at the forefront of a greener, smarter future for agriculture and food production.\n\n",
