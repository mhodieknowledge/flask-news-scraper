The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. This week we want to discuss regulatory sandboxes for fintech start-ups in Zimbabwe. What is a regulatory sandbox, and why is it necessary for fintech start-ups in Zimbabwe?\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nYour question is in 2 parts, I will start by explaining what a fintech is before I attempt to explain a regulatory sandbox for the fintech industry and why it is necessary for fintech start-ups in Zimbabwe.\n\nA fintech is a company that relies mainly, if not solely, on technology and cloud services to provide financial services to its customers. It is not limited by the need to have your traditional brick and mortar to be able to provide these services. Services that may be provided by such fintech solutions include payments, savings, investments, borrowing of finances and many others. The idea being to make it easier and accessible for the consumer to transact and benefit from such services.\n\nSandboxes, on the other hand, are controlled or isolated testing environments that allow innovators to test their new product or service without the burdensome requirement of complying with all applicable regulations affecting that particular product.\n\nAnd now to the why of your question. Complying with financial regulations may in some instances prove to be expensive for a start-up fintech company and the use of a sandbox allows the start up to speed up entry into the market, identify and hopefully mitigate, if not remedy, any risk that would have potentially bedevilled the start-up following a straight to market launch in the absence of a sandbox.\n\nReporter: What is the difference thenbetweena regulatory sandbox and an innovation hub?\n\nVM: Innovation hubs, in general terms, involve the sharing of ideas between innovators and or with their regulators, which may include guidance on regulations by the regulators as they work on providing solutions to the problems in that sector. Sandboxes allow for the actual experimentation of how the product will work in a live market without necessarily being subjected to the obligation of adhering to prevailing regulations for market entry.\n\nReporter:Is Zimbabwe conducive for a Fintech sandbox?\n\nVM: Well, these fintech sandboxes are a common trend in the world and particularly in Africa. Traditionally, Zimbabwe has proved to be adaptive to new methods of utilizing financial technology. The country remains conducive because the economy is heavily reliant on cash for transactions and a significant percentage of the population is unbanked and operating their businesses outside the formal financial channels, providing such sandboxes encourages more innovators to bring out products that may mop the unbanked liquidity into the formal market with the added benefit of including this unbanked demography into the beneficial financial services offered to the formalized market.\n\nReporter:In Zimbabwe, which laws regulate fintech sandboxes?\n\nVM: We have the Fintech Regulatory Guidelines of 2021 from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, which, among other things, provide guidance and requirements for potential participants to test their products in a live environment while at the same time prioritizing consumer safety and protection.\n\nThe guidelines also encourage collaboration between the startup fintechs and the traditional financial sector, in which the innovative technology intends to improve by the launch of their product.\n\nWe also have the Securities and Exchange Commission of Zimbabwe Regulatory Sandbox guidelines of 2024 which are aimed at facilitating capital market fintech innovations.\n\nReporter: What are the real benefits of the sandbox and is it useful?\n\nVM: Besides the obvious benefit of reducing the cost to the innovator in the testing phase, which is about 24 months, it allows constant interaction between the innovator and the regulator, creating an environment where the regulator understands the operations of the fintech product. This will prove highly useful should there be a need to lobby for policy changes to accommodate disruptive technology.\n\nI am also personally of the view that the sandbox allows for easier fundraising as there will be a clear blueprint of how the product works, plus the common hurdle of regulatory approval will have been passed and consumer appetite tested.\n\nReporter: How is an innovator assured that the innovation will not be distributed to competitors during the application and testing periods?\n\nVM: The Reserve Bank guidelines on Fintech Regulatory sandbox provide that all information provided by the innovator will be treated as confidential and any disclosure to any third party will first require the approval of the innovator unless the disclosure has been ordered by a court order or under any law.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima, we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

Community volunteers are going to be required for optimum spraying coverage.\n\nIt is, therefore, important for residents in and around Mbare Flats and other areas to be aware of the factors that lead to such infestations. Residents are also urged to help control the spreads through extensive community participation.\n\nSpraying alone will not solve this problem. Bed bugs hide in small crevices on beds, sofas, wardrobes, walls e.t.c thus regular physical cleaning is required where chemicals cant reach, said Gama.\n\n",

            "content": "By CNN\n\nUNITED States federal prosecutors added two additional criminal charges against music mogul Sean Diddy Combs, one month before he is set to go to trial in New York on sex trafficking charges.\n\nProsecutors charged Combs with one additional count of sex trafficking and one additional count of transportation to engage in prostitution relating to Victim-2, according to a superseding indictment filed Friday. Authorities allege that conduct occurred between 2021 and 2024.\n\nCombs was previously charged with racketeering conspiracy and transportation to engage in prostitution related to three victims and one count of sex trafficking related only to Victim-1. He now faces five federal charges.\n\nJury selection for his trial is scheduled to start on May 5. Combs has pleaded not guilty.\n\nWhen reached for comment, lawyers for Combs said, These are not new allegations or new accusers. These are the same individuals, former long-term girlfriends, who were involved in consensual relationships. This was their private sex life, defined by consent, not coercion.\n\nThey allege Combs and his associates used his position of power to coerce women, often under the pretense of a romantic relationship, into engaging in sex acts, according to the indictment.\n\nProsecutors said during these encounters, known as Freak Offs, women were drugged and forced to have sex with male prostitutes. The Freaks Offs often lasted days and were video recorded, the indictment alleges.\n\nCombs lawyers have maintained no crimes were committed and the sexual encounters were consensual and part of a long-term relationship.\n\nCombs is also accused of reacting violently when his authority was threatened. On one occasion, the indictment says, Combs allegedly dangled a victim over an apartment balcony and was involved in kidnapping and arson.\n\nProsecutors also revealed in a new court filing that four accusers are expected to testify at the trial.\n\nVictim-1, who was Combs long-term girlfriend, is planning to testify under her real name. Prosecutors have asked that three other alleged victims be allowed to testify under pseudonyms.\n\nThis case has already received an exceptional amount of media coverage, which will presumably only increase as trial proceeds. Permitting these measures will prevent unnecessary public disclosure of the victims identities, and the harassment from the media and others, they wrote in a court filing Friday.\n\nIn addition, prosecutors said, publicizing the names of these three victims will cause them significant embarrassment, anxiety, and social stigma. The accusers have said they are concerned that their testimony would impact their personal relationships and future employment, the government said.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the accusers identities are known to Combs and his lawyers.\n\nJudges have allowed accusers to testify using nicknames or pseudonyms in other high-profile cases, including the sex trafficking trial of Ghislaine Maxwell, Jeffrey Epsteins former girlfriend and accomplice.\n\n",

And guess when it happened? When those kids were little.\n\nWhen asked about Michelles comments, Barack told CBS Mornings: Let me just say this: it sure helps to be out of the White House. And to have a little more time with her.\n\nMichelle  when our girls were growing up, that was priority number one, two, three and four. And so, I did not fully appreciate, I think, as engaged of a father as I was, the degree of stress and tension for her, knowing that not just me and Michelle were under scrutiny and in this strange environment, but that we were raising our daughters in a kind of situation that just wasnt normal.\n\nMichelle met Barack in 1989 when she was 25 and he was 28, while both were working at the Sidley Austin LLP law firm in Chicago.\n\nThe former president asked Michelle on a date within a month of meeting, and they became engaged in 1991.\n\nThey married the following year and later had two daughters, Malia in 1998 and Sasha in 2001.\n\nBaracks political career began in earnest in 2004 when he was elected as an Illinois state senator, bringing the family into the public eye.\n\nIn 2008, he was elected the 44th president of the United States and won re-election in 2012.\n\n",

However, time and again, the government has been its own worst enemy, shooting itself in the foot with policies and practices that deter investors.\n\nNvidias supercomputers, powered by graphic processing units, or GPUs (the workhorse chips behind AI), will be deployed at Cassavas data centres in South Africa from as early as June, with plans to roll them out across the companys other facilities in Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, and Nigeria.\n\nThis is a clear indication that, where AI development is concerned, South Africa will be punching above its weight in the coming years.\n\nSpeaking in Kigali, Rwanda, at the Inaugural Global AI Summit on Africa, Masiyiwa was blunt about his reasons for side-lining Zimbabwe and other African nations due to their less-than-stellar business environments.\n\nMasiyiwa emphasised the need for African leaders to cultivate a pro-investor ecosystem.\n\nI cannot overemphasise the need for our leaders to create an ecosystem for investment because people like me stepping forward and going out to raise billions of dollars to buy these chips, we can only go to where it is investor friendly, he said.\n\nHe added, underlining his point with a stark warning: We wont come back and tell you your investment environment doesnt work. We just walk away. So, weve got to talk to each other.

            "content": "By Bloomberg\n\nA LIQUIDITY crunch in Zimbabwe is deepening the economys embrace of the US dollar and undermining the bullion-backed currency introduced by the government almost a year ago.\n\nThe ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, which began trading on April 8, is the southern African nations sixth attempt since 2009 at replacing the dollar with a functional local currency. It has not gone well.\n\nIn September, after persistent weakness against the dollar, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe devalued the ZiG by 43%, raised the key interest rate to 35% from 20% and increased cash reserve requirements to steady the currency. It has depreciated almost 4% this year.\n\nThe stability measures have led to an economy swimming in dollars, said Eddie Cross, a Harare-based independent economist and former monetary policy committee member.\n\nThe liquidity crunch has now killed the ZiG, he said.\n\nThe ZiG has retreated as a currency of trade and effectively we have dollarized.\n\nThe tight monetary policy stance has fuelled a slump with stocks plunging on Harares main exchange, consumer prices falling 0.1% in March and ZiG supply scant on the unofficial market.\n\nThe ZiG is being used to settle mostly minor transactions including utility and tax payments and a portion of civil servant wages. The rest is paid in dollars. The currency cannot be used to pay for essentials including fuel, rent and medicines.\n\nThe highest denomination ZiG banknote is worth about $7.50  enough to buy six loaves of bread.\n\nDespite being backed by more than $550 million in gold and cash reserves, used as a selling point to win public trust, its limited use in salient sectors of the economy makes differences with its failed predecessors seem cosmetic, said Jacques Nel, head of Africa macro at Oxford Economics.\n\nIt would have taken something special to convince Zimbabweans that this time is different, he said.\n\nBumpy ride\n\nNot even the more than 30% surge in the bullion price since the gold-backed currencys adoption has helped.\n\nPart of the problem is that the level of hard currency reserves backing it are woefully inadequate, because the nation has been locked out of capital markets since a debt default in 1999, said Hasnain Malik, an emerging-market strategist at Tellimer in Dubai.\n\nIts demise should be no surprise, he said.\n\nStill, policymakers dont plan to loosen their tight monetary stance or ditch the ZiG. Last week, the central bank kept the key rate at 35% and added that it would remain vigilant to any emerging risks to inflation and exchange rate stability.\n\nIts going to be a bumpy ride, but we are fully committed, Innocent Matshe, the RBZs deputy governor told business leaders on Feb. 13 in the capital, Harare.\n\nThe currencys survival depends on the ruling partys support, said Tony Hawkins, an independent economic consultant in Harare and former economics professor at the University of Zimbabwe.\n\nHistory has shown that every new currency in Zimbabwe has a shorter lifespan than its predecessor and with the ZiG not really being used it could be headed for the same fate, he said.\n\nWhat else is the ZiG used for except arbitrage opportunities and to pay civil servants, Hawkins, said.\n\nI cant see the ZiG surviving that long.\n\n",

I also stated that the Presidents family were involved.\n\nOn Tuesday I requested a meeting with the President and told him that I recognised that I should not have involved his family, and I apologised unreservedly.\n\nHe expressed concern about the substance of my general allegations on the magnitude of corruption and asked that I substantiate this. I agreed to provide him with a dossier of what I understand is going on. On the issue of his children being involved, he asked who was implicated and I identified 3 (three) of his sons.\n\nOn Wednesday I returned to State House to discuss this further with the three men involved and I outlined what I was hearing but could not provide firm evidence to support these allegations and rumors. I again apologised and said I would withdraw my statement on this matter, reads the letter.\n\n",

The driver informed the police that he does not have keys for the trailers. Police forcibly opened the trailer and conducted a search, and they found bags containing items suspected to be explosives, said provincial Hawks spokesperson, Warrant Officer Lethunya Mmuroa.\n\nAfter the discovery, Mmuroa said police called the Musina-based Bomb Technicians, Hawks Serious Organised Crime Investigation, and Local Criminal Record Central for further assistance.\n\nMmuroa added that when the units arrived, they thoroughly searched the truck for the second time.\n\nAs a result, the team found 16 reels of detonating fuse explosives, 2182 superpowers, and 90 blasting cartridges explosives. The suspect was arrested.\n\n",
