            "content": "By Farai Matiashe, Al Jazeera\n\nHarare, Zimbabwe Guy Watson-Smith felt hurt and betrayed when his 5,000-hectare (12,355-acre) farm in Beatrice, in Zimbabwes Mashonaland East province, was violently invaded by three armed men in the early 2000s.\n\nThe then-51-year-old white commercial farmer was not just losing his land; he was leaving behind hundreds of workers and their families, many of whom he had known since childhood.\n\nWe cried, the 75-year-old told Al Jazeera.\n\nOn the morning of September 18, 2001, Watson-Smith, his two farm managers, and his unwelcome visitors sat at a table on the patio.\n\nWatson-Smiths wife, Vicky, offered them a cup of tea.\n\nBut the message was simple: leave or die.\n\nHis family was given two hours to pack.\n\nThey fled to the capital, Harare, 54km (33.5 miles) away, seeking refuge at his father-in-laws home in the Avenues, an inner-city suburb.\n\nWatson-Smiths ordeal was not an isolated incident.\n\nAcross the country, war veterans armed with pistols led similar land grabs, together with their children and with assistance from the polices elite units.\n\nThe invasions were part of the chaotic Fast Track Land Reform Program (FTLRP), launched under President Robert Mugabe in 2000 to reclaim land from about 4,000 white farmers and redistribute it to landless Black Zimbabweans.\n\nBut instead of redressing past injustices, Zimbabweans say it fuelled economic and land insecurity as mainly governing party loyalists benefitted from the reclamations.\n\nMore than two decades on, a struggling agricultural sector haunts Zimbabwe, leaving the question of land ownership unresolved, even as the government has begun to paycompensationto white farmers.\n\nWhen land was seized from white farmers in the early 2000s, it was forcibly and sometimes violently taken, with at least seven people killed in the process.\n\nHowever, Zimbabwes land struggles did not begin with Mugabes FTLRP or even the countrys independence in 1980. The tensions stretch back over a century to the arrival of white British settlers in 1890.\n\nWhen the British arrived, they invaded Mashonaland areas and took mining rights from the locals under agreements that the local leadership did not understand.\n\nThey then expanded control, violently displacing Black people from their fertile ancestral lands.\n\nForced into barren areas with poor soil, low rainfall and tsetse flies, Black Zimbabweans struggled to farm or raise cattle.\n\nBy the 1950s, land was formally divided along racial lines, with white settlers holding the most fertile areas.\n\nThis deep injustice fuelled the liberation struggle.\n\nRevolutionary groups like ZANU and ZAPU took up arms, and from 1964 to 1979, land was at the heart of the Rhodesian Bush War  also known as the Second Chimurenga, during which Black Zimbabweans fought for independence from the white minority government.\n\nThe 1969 Land Tenure Act, which escalated Black land evictions, was a breaking point.\n\nFor many fighters, reclaiming the land became not just about survival, but about identity and economic freedom.\n\nThe war ended with the Lancaster House Agreement drawn up and signed in London in December 1979, setting the stage for Zimbabwes first democratic elections.\n\nOn April 18, 1980, after Mugabes victory, Zimbabwe gained independence from Britain. The Lancaster agreement barred Mugabes government from forcibly seizing land, allowing only voluntary transfers under a willing buyer, willing seller system from 1980 to 1990.\n\nMany war veterans felt betrayed.\n\nThey had fought for liberation, expecting immediate land redistribution, but years of slow negotiations left them frustrated. From 1990 to 2000, land reclamations took place by the government compulsorily buying land from white commercial farmers using funds from donors, including Britain.\n\nHowever, the process became politicised as some senior politicians and elites redistributed land among themselves instead of to the poor. Some of the funds were allegedly loaned to ruling ZANU-PF party loyalists and not used for the intended purposes of land redistribution. This raised accusations of corruption, causing some donors to cut funding.\n\nBritain, which had initially committed 20 million pounds ($26.6m at the current rate) to fund the land reform programme, withdrew support in 1997.\n\nThe United Kingdom said it could no longer accept responsibility for colonial injustices and would not fund a programme plagued by corruption and elite capture.\n\nDonor funding helped the Zimbabwean government buy land from white commercial farmers, enabling about 50,000 Black farmers to receive land. But the programme was ultimately underfunded and fell far short of the targeted 8 million hectares (19.8 million acres).\n\nIn February 2000, under mounting pressure from furious war veterans, Mugabe attempted to amend the constitution to allow land seizures without compensation.\n\nWhen the referendum failed, the war veterans and their families took matters into their own hands by invading farms. Soon, Mugabe officially followed suit by launching the FTLRP.\n\nAt that time, the minority white population, which made up about 4 percent of the country, owned more than half the land in Zimbabwe.\n\nFor months, Watson-Smiths land, where he grew tobacco, maize, paprika, groundnuts and Rhodes seed for export, remained untouched until the day a powerful war hero with the ZANU-PF set his sights on it.\n\nWatson-Smith was in Harare, where he worked as the Mashonaland East provincial chairman of the Commercial Farmers Union, a body representing white commercial farmers, when he learned that his farm had been invaded by retired General Solomon Mujuru, a former commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces and top ZANU-PF figure in the province.\n\nEfforts to move their assets like tractors and vehicles went in vain, Watson-Smith said, as the invaders allowed only his wife to take their personal belongings, like photographs and furniture, from the house before leaving.\n\nEven the courts offered little protection.\n\nThough Watson-Smith won a High Court ruling to reclaim his assets, Mujurus thugs chased away the sheriff sent to enforce the order.\n\nWatson-Smith and his family were lucky to escape their farm unharmed. But they were still afraid. On December 21, 2001, they fled through the Beitbridge border post to South Africa, later moving to France to start a new life.\n\nBefore the farm invasions, Zimbabwe produced enough to feed itself and for exports to Southern Africa and Europe. Agriculture was the backbone of the economy, employing much of the countrys workforce. Some Black Zimbabweans had also risen to the top, managing farms.\n\nInitially, Mugabes land expropriation programme was meant to redistribute land to disadvantaged Black Zimbabweans to boost equity and agricultural development.\n\nBut under the cover of correcting colonial injustices, powerful officials seized productive farms from both white and Black farmers.\n\nKondozi Estates in eastern Zimbabwe was one of the farms seized by senior ZANU-PF figures in 2004.\n\nThe land in Manicaland province was co-owned by Black Zimbabwean Edwin Moyo and the white de Klerk family.\n\nAt the time, it was a vital exporter of fresh produce, particularly high-quality beans, gooseberries, corn, mangetout and sugar snaps to European retailers like Tesco and Sainsburys.\n\nIt employed hundreds in Mutare, and its destruction was a death blow to the local economy.\n\nThe same pattern repeated itself on other farms, locals say, with Black owners without strong ties to the ZANU-PF continuing to face evictions.\n\nIn 2021, human rights defender and lawyer Siphosami Malunga lost his farm to ZANU-PF secretary-general Obert Mpofu.\n\nThough Zimbabwes lower courts later ruled in his favour and he is back on his farm awaiting a High Court decision, the battle over its ownership rages on.\n\nLand reform was necessary, 53-year-old Malunga told Al Jazeera.\n\nThe colonial project dispossessed Blacks, pushing them on to barren land while whites took the best farms. But the way reform was handled enriched the elite while leaving ordinary Zimbabweans with nothing.\n\nMugabe once campaigned for a one man, one farm policy. Yet his allies ignored it. Even his wife, Grace Mugabe, amassed at least 15 farms.\n\nMost of the beneficiaries of the FTLRP were ZANU-PF loyalists, experts note.\n\nRejoice Ngwenya, a political analyst based in Harare, said Mugabes land reform was not about Black empowerment.\n\nIt had motives: firstly, to pacify war veterans that were agitating for more recognition; secondly, to punish white commercial farmers who were supporting the opposition. The man was insecure, he told Al Jazeera.\n\nIf you promise to not expropriate Black-owned farms, you should not touch Moyo or Malungas farms. But ZANU-PF does not care, he remarked.\n\nVivid Gwede, another Harare-based political analyst, said land ownership has been used as a tool to punish disloyalty or reward loyalty to the governing party.\n\nOn account of politics, some Black farmers have had their land invaded, he said.\n\nUnlike white commercial farmers who spent decades learning the land, most of the ZANU-PF-aligned farmers who took over had no farming experience.\n\nThe new owners were people who had spent most of their lives in the bush fighting against white colonialists, experts note, while many Black farm workers who had experience managing white-owned farms did not benefit from land reclamations.\n\nAs a result of the chaotic and violent invasions, knowledge of agricultural practices was also not passed on.\n\nSoon, the Southern African nation with a once-thriving agricultural economy began to face a food crisis, later compounded by climate change.\n\nFor years, many Zimbabweans have depended on food aid from donors like the United Nations World Food Programme. In April 2024, the government declared a national disaster as a severe El Nino-induced drought left more than half of Zimbabwes 15.1 million people facing hunger.\n\nThe crisis exposed the countrys collapsed agricultural sector. Before land seizures, white commercial farmers and Black farmers like Moyo had irrigation schemes to mitigate droughts. ZANU-PF dismantled these systems, leaving the country vulnerable.\n\nZimbabwes collapse in agricultural productivity stems not just from poor planning, but from a deeper culture of impunity, experts say.\n\nAcross the country, though court orders were issued to stop farm invasions and evictions of white commercial farmers, these were ignored. Since 2000, former farmers have filed hundreds of legal cases, trying to reclaim their assets, with little success.\n\nThe 2013 constitution promised compensation, but only for farm improvements, not the land itself.\n\nWhen Emmerson Mnangagwa took power in a 2017 military coup, he inherited a shattered economy, abandoned and poorly managed farms, food shortages, and soaring unemployment.\n\nDesperate for solutions, he reached a $3.5bn compensation deal with white farmers in 2020, hoping to mend relations with the West and lift US economic sanctions imposed in 2001. But the plan stalled.\n\nIn October 2024, the government set aside $20m to compensate a handful of foreign white farmers from Denmark, Switzerland, the Netherlands and Germany whose investments were affected by the land reform programme.\n\nThis month, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube announced that the government had paid $3.1m to white former farmers who lost land during Zimbabwes land reform.\n\nHowever, the Compensation Steering Committee (CSC), a domestic body representing white farmers, criticised the compensation as a token gesture andrejectedthe deal, saying it wants negotiations instead.\n\nWere willing to talk, but they [the government] are not talking to us, Ian McKersie, chairman of the CSC told Al Jazeera.\n\nIn response, Nick Mangwana, permanent secretary in Zimbabwes Ministry of Information, told Al Jazeera there are factions among the white farmers. If they speak, they are speaking for themselves, they do not represent the mainstream, he said. It is preposterous [to reject the deal]. It does not make sense.\n\nMangwana also denied that there are ongoing land seizures, such as the case of Malunga, whose farm was taken in 2021. These are just disputes  It is not a land invasion. There is no land invasion in Zimbabwe, he said.\n\nNow in France, Watson-Smith runs a real estate business.\n\nBut back in Zimbabwe, his once-productive Alamein Farm has fallen into disuse; its land is now less vibrant than it used to be.\n\nAfter General Mujuru, who was one of Zimbabwes most feared men, seized Watson-Smiths farm, he turned it into a hunting ground. Following Mujurus death in 2011, his wife, former Vice President Joice Mujuru, kept the land but struggled to maintain it.\n\nMeanwhile, Kondozi Estates, the major part-Black owned farm taken by ZANU-PF elites, also fell into decay. A visit this year revealed abandoned equipment and overgrown fields.\n\nAcross the country, seized farms remain untended.\n\nDuring the land reform, farmers were given long-term leases. But banks refused to recognise these leases as collateral, making it impossible for farmers to secure loans.\n\nIn late 2024, President Mnangagwa ordered the Ministry of Lands to stop issuing permits and leases in favour of title deeds. But experts warn this is problematic as it does not address the land dispute between resettled farmers and dispossessed white commercial farmers.\n\nIf the government issues title deeds on land already under existing historic title deeds, its unlawful, Willie Spies, a lawyer assisting dispossessed Zimbabweans, told Al Jazeera.\n\nA legitimate process requires compensating former farmers fairly before transferring ownership.\n\nNew farmers have already benefitted from state subsidies, including a 2007 mechanisation programme that distributed tractors and harvesters without repayment.\n\nZimbabwes debt now stands at $21bn, according to the World Bank  $13bn owed to international creditors and $8bn in domestic debt. Some of the domestic debt is a result of the agricultural subsidies, which ended up benefitting political elites and not the poor rural farmers.\n\nCorruption runs deep, said Malunga, who is still awaiting a final court decision about ownership of his farm.\n\nAgricultural subsidy programmes were hijacked by the elite, enabling grand corruption and theft of billions, he said.\n\nWhile title deeds could offer land security to the new farm owners, he warned: This risks creating a privileged Black landowning class.\n\nWatson-Smith notes that although title deeds helped farmers like him by open[ing] the doors to credit for irrigation, dams and every farm improvement, giving title deeds to new farm owners without addressing past injustices is meaningless.\n\nIt might impress Zimbabwean banks, but international lenders wont recognise stolen property, he said.\n\nOnce the backbone of Zimbabwes economy, agriculture is now crippled by corruption, mismanagement and political greed, farmers say.\n\nMeanwhile, the scars of the land grabs remain, both for displaced former farmers and a nation still grappling with the fallout.\n\nAs many white farmers live in self-exile abroad, many common Black farmers are in limbo, facing off against senior politicians in the battle for land ownership.\n\nFor now, Malunga is back on his farm, growing tomatoes and other crops. But he remains unsettled.\n\nPending the decision of the High Court, we are in occupation, he said, knowing his future is uncertain until the judge decides.\n\n",

            "content": "By Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe and Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThis story was originally published byGlobal Press Journal.\n\nGOROMONZI DISTRICT, ZIMBABWE  Darlington Mutakura struggled with the Goromonzi districts housing system for almost 20 years. With a dream of owning a house someday in this semi-urban area near Harare, he faithfully paid his US$13 annual fee on the Rural District Councils waiting list for a decade after moving to the area in 2007.\n\nFinally, hope came, not from the council but his sister. She had long ago acquired some land from traditional leaders in her village in the area, about a half-hours drive east of Harare. From that, she carved out a portion for him.\n\nIn 2017, Mutakura built a small two-room cottage on the land and at last thought that he wouldnt have to pay rent anymore.\n\nBut five years later, council officials slapped him with an official letter: Notice to reorganise the illegal settlement and payment of penalty fees.\n\nMutakura wasnt the only resident to receive this letter. The council letter threatened to demolish structures and relocate households for what it called proper planning of the area. The council considered Mutakura and others who obtained land through the traditional system to be illegal settlers.\n\nThe traditional method of land acquisition, like Mutakuras, is deeply woven into Zimbabwes rural traditions, and protected by law. Still, he and others were each charged a penalty of US$1,500. Some village heads, including Christopher Tafirenyika, warned their villagers not to pay the penalties because the council had not engaged village leaders and it was unclear what the money was for.\n\nThat warning rang true for Mutakura, who ended up paying the fine but still doesnt know whether hell be able to stay on the land that he says he acquired legally.\n\nIt doesnt make sense to pay a 1,500-dollar fine and still own nothing, he says.\n\nAs the region transitions from rural to urban, traditional land distribution systems face increasing pressure, creating conflicts over land ownership. Steep penalties like those imposed in the Goromonzi region come to communities already struggling with increasing economic instability.\n\nA US$1,500 fine is beyond the reach of many who live in this area. According to thelatest available data,the average monthly household income in rural Zimbabwe in 2024 was US$88, a drop from US$116 in 2023.\n\nEven if a settlement is deemed illegal, a national law sets the penalty at US$300 or up to a year in jail. Nowhere does it authorize a US$1,500 charge.\n\nA delicate balance\n\nAcross rural Africa,land traditionallypasses through inheritance, customary allocations, or local purchase, and these processes have been led by traditional village leaders.\n\nLand is not individually owned, but held collectively according to traditional practices and lineage, with access regulated by the communitys customary rule, says Dzikamai Bere, national director of Zimbabwe Human Rights Association.\n\nAccording to the 1998 Traditional Leaders Act, chiefs and headmen oversee settlement rights and are also responsible for admitting new settlers in the areas they manage. Additionally, all land allocation and subdivision should be done with the approval of the village head.\n\nTraditional leaders have always had the main authority to distribute land, following customary rules while working with the local government council. The council officially grants land use rights but  under the Communal Lands Act that codifies these unwritten rules  the government body must work with traditional leaders and respect local customs.\n\nThis delicate balance between tradition and government once ruled rural land rights in Zimbabwe.\n\n[In the 1980s], the village court would meet and find a place for someone who needed land. Wed take the matter to the chief, discuss it with other men in the village, make sure we respected land boundaries, and then register with the rural district council under the chiefs instruction, says Tafirenyika.\n\nBut around theearly 2000s,Tafirenyika says he watched this system begin to crumble. Land management in Zimbabwe underwent significant changes due to the governments fast-track land reform program, which aimed to redistribute land from white commercial farmers to black Zimbabweans, particularly those living in communal areas managed by traditional leaders.\n\nTafirenyika says the Rural District Council now allocates land in Goromonzi, and traditional leaders are powerless  even though the laws that allow people to obtain land through the traditional route have not changed.\n\nMirriam Kwenda, 70, inherited her land from family. After her husband died, the soil fed her three children. Now its vanishing before her eyes. She says that part of what was her farmland is now subdivided into housing that the council is selling.\n\nNow the council pegged all the land, and I dont know which one is mine, she says.\n\nAnd Mutakura worries about whether hell have anything to leave for his children.\n\nWe are living a borrowed life, a life of fear, he says.\n\nLinda Mujuruis a Global Press Journal reporter-in-residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.\n\nGamuchirai Masiyiwais a Global Press Journal reporter-in-residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.\n\nGlobal Press Journal delivers bold, investigative and in-depth explanatory reporting on the worlds most urgent issues.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nUS Senior Advisor for Africa Massad Boulos has said that President Donald Trump values Africa, despite announcing sweeping aid cuts that have caused considerable humanitarian distress across the continent.\n\nTrump announced the aid freeze on his first day in office in January in line with his America First foreign policy, while Trumps recent tariffs have raised fears of the end of a trade deal between the US and Africa meant to boost economic growth.\n\nBut Mr Boulos told BBCs Newsday that Africa was very important to Trump and downplayed reports that the US was planning to close some of its missions in the continent.\n\nHe highly values Africa and African people, Mr Boulos added.\n\nThe aid cuts have affected health programmes across Africa, including shipments of critical medical supplies, including HIV drugs.\n\nThe majority of the US Agency for International Developments (USAID) programmes, which provided health and humanitarian assistance to vulnerable nations,have since been terminated.\n\nEight countries  six of them in Africa, including Nigeria, Kenya and Lesotho could soon run out of HIV drugsfollowing the US decision to pause foreign aid, the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned.\n\nThere are fears that nearly six million more Africans could be pushed into extreme poverty next year following the aid cuts,according to the Institute for Security Studies(ISS)  a pan-African think-tank.\n\nEarlier this month, eight people, including five children, died after walking for hours to seek treatment for cholera in South Sudan after aid cuts by the Trump administration forced local health clinics to close, the international charity Save the Children reported.\n\nBut Mr Boulos said those reported deaths could not be directly linked to the US aid cuts and said they were needed to ensure the money was being well used.\n\nIt is absolutely necessary [for the US] to review some of these programmes for much more efficiency and transparency, Mr Boulos said.\n\nWe have to make sure the [aid funds] are going to the right place and that we are getting the desired outcome, he added.\n\nMr Boulos, whose son is married to Trumps daughter, Tiffany, said several US companies had expressed an interest in exploiting minerals in the Democratic Republic of Congo, followinghis recent trip to the resource-rich central African nation.\n\nDR Congo, home to vast natural reserves like lithium which is essential for battery and electric vehicle production, has been battling Rwandan-backed M23 rebels, who have seized large areas of territory this year.\n\nCongolese President Flix Tshisekedi believes US involvement in extracting the minerals could help quell the violence that has plagued the east of the country for nearly 30 years. Currently, DR Congos mineral wealth isdominated by Chinese firms.\n\nMr Boulos said his country was also interested in exploring minerals in neighbouring Rwanda, but called on the country to first withdraw its troops from DR Congo and stop its support for the M23. Rwanda denies involvement in the conflict.\n\nAsked if the US was only interested in benefiting economically from Africa and not its welfare, Boulos said our job is to promote the US interests and promote our strategic partnerships.\n\nTrump is also determined to end wars and establish peace across the world, the envoy said, citing the conflict in Sudan as a big concern for the US government.\n\nMr Boulos, who has served as Washingtons senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs since December, also visited Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda in his trip.\n\nHe has business interests in Africa, including in a Nigeria-based company that distributes motor vehicles and equipment in West Africa.\n\nThe Lebanese-born businessman said Trump felt it was time to end the unfair advantage taken by other international players of Africa.\n\nResponding to reports in the US media that the Trump administration was planning to close most of its diplomatic missions in Africa, Mr Boulos said this was not very accurate, adding: Africa is very important to Trump.\n\nOn the trade tariffs announced by Trump, Mr Boulos said they had zero net-effect for most African countries as they touched on small trade volumes from the continent.\n\nMany countries have lined up for negotiations and at the end of the day we want fairness and a win-win solution, he added.\n\nThe small southern African country of Lesotho was hit by the highest of the most recently announced tariffs  50%  before they were paused for 90 days.\n\nIt has used theAfrican Growth and Opportunity Act (Agoa)to become a major exporter of textiles, including jeans, to the US. This trade accounts for more than 10% of Lesothos national income.\n\nAgoa was set up by former Us President Bill Clinton in 2000 to encourage trade and investment in Africa but analysts fear that it is unlikely to be renewed by the current, Republican-dominated Congress.\n\n",

Shes perfect and hilarious.\n\nLumley described the Nevermore atmosphere as intoxicating, adding: Its wonderful. I get to wear many, many huge wigs, one on top of the other  and lots of quite constraining clothes, so I love it.\n\nMeanwhile, Buscemi described Principal Dort as a bit of a mysterious figure, adding: Something about him is not right, but he loves the school and he has real outcast pride.\n\nThe first series of Wednesday was Netflixs biggest hit to date, and cemented Ortega as a major screen star. She has since appeared in Beetlejuice Beetlejuice, Death of a Unicorn and Scream XI.\n\nIn the trailer, Wednesdays mother Morticia (Catherine Zeta-Jones) notes its the first time her daughter has returned to school willingly.\n\nFor her part, Wednesday describes returning to school as like returning to the scene of the crime, noting that she already knows where the bodies are buried.\n\nLater, the young Addams daughter is seen attending a macarbre tea party for a group of dolls.\n\nWherever theres murder and mayhem, Wednesday reflects, you will always find an Addams.\n\nThe trailers reference to mayhem could hint at a previously reportedcameo appearance from Lady Gaga,who recently released an album of that name.\n\nNetflix will be hoping the series replicates the success of the first. Its decision to split the new season in half is likely due to efforts to retain subscribers, refresh its platform and increase the hype around the show.\n\nWednesdayStranger Things (season four)AdolescenceMonster: The Jeffrey Dahmer StoryBridgerton (season one)The Queens GambitBridgerton (season three)The Night AgentFool Me OnceStranger ThingsSource: Netflix\n\nSource: Netflix\n\n",

The win also marks Zimbabwes first Test win in over four years, with the last one coming against Afghanistan in Abu Dhabi in March 2021.\n\nThe chase was Zimbabwes highest successful fourth-innings effort  surpassing 162 against Pakistan in 1998  and marked just their fifth Test win away from home.\n\nIn a tense final innings chasing 174, Zimbabwe stuttered in the middle after a 95-run opening wicket stand but successfully chased down the target to secure a 1-0 lead in the series.\n\nOn Day 1, Bangladesh won the toss and chose to bat first, but Zimbabwes bowlers quickly put them under pressure by removing both openers within the first 10 overs. A 66-run third-wicket stand between skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto and Mominul Haque provided some resistance and turned out to be the highest partnership of the innings.\n\nHowever, the rest of the batting lineup crumbled, thanks to impressive three-wicket hauls from Blessing Muzarabani and Wellington Masakadza, along with two wickets each for Victor Nyauchi and Wessly Madhevere. As a result, Bangladesh were bowled out for a modest total of 191.\n\nZimbabwes batters carried the momentum forward, putting Bangladesh under pressure with a solid display. Brian Bennett led the charge with a quickfire 57 off 64 balls, while veteran Sean Williams anchored the innings with a well-crafted 59 off 108 deliveries.\n\nDespite a five-wicket haul from Mehidy Hasan Miraz and a three-wicket effort from Nahid Rana, Zimbabwe managed to post a total of 273. Though not massive, it was enough to secure a healthy 82-run lead at the end of the first innings.\n\nDespite an early wicket in their second innings, Bangladesh began strongly with the bat. Mominul Haque and Mahmudul Hasan Joy put together a solid 60-run stand for the first wicket, followed by a 65-run partnership between Haque and skipper Najmul Hossain Shanto.\n\nShanto played a composed knock of 60 off 105 balls, while Jaker Ali contributed a steady 58 off 111. Just as Zimbabwe seemed to be slipping, their bowlers turned the tide, taking the last five Bangladesh wickets for just 61 runs. Blessing Muzarabani was the standout performer, claiming a brilliant six-wicket haul as Bangladesh were bundled out for 255.\n\nZimbabwe looked to be cruising towards victory with a strong start in the chase, with openers Ben Curran and Brian Bennett piling up 95 runs before losing their first. However, Bangladesh clawed their way back into the contest, thanks to Mehidy Hasan Mirazs five-wicket haul once again that turned the game in the hosts favour.\n\nDespite the pressure and a few nervy moments, Zimbabwe held their breath to edge past the finish line, sealing a thrilling three-wicket win. It marked their first Test victory over Bangladesh in seven years and the first in over four years against any side for Zimbabwe.\n\nThe two sides are set to face off again in Chattogram, with the second Test beginning on April 28.\n\n",
