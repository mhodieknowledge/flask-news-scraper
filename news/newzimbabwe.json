Response teams and local teams will work to find the people who may be infected and need to receive care, to ensure everyone is protected as quickly as possible,WHO added in a statement.\n\nDR Congo had a stockpile of treatments, including 2,000 doses of the Ervebo vaccine, effective to protect against this type of Ebola, the global health body said.\n\nThe last Ebola outbreak in DR Congo was three years ago, killing six people.\n\nAn outbreak in 2018-20 was far deadlier, claiming more than 2,000 lives.\n\nThe virus, which is thought to have originated in fruit bats, was first detected in 1976 near the Ebola River in what is now DR Congo.\n\nPeople are infected when they have direct contact through broken skin, or the mouth and nose, with the blood, vomit, faeces or bodily fluids of someone with Ebola.\n\n",

What I request is that the Hon. Member should bring the paperwork which talks about the prevalence of homicide cases.\n\nIf we respond to such a question without evidence that this is happening, this is an issue which does not augur well, said Ziyambi.\n\nIn recent months, the country has been witnessing murder cases related to gun violence. They have been attributed to the proliferation and ownership of guns by individuals.\n\nIn May this year, the Zimbabwe Republic Police raised concern about the increase in illegal firearms, which is in contravention of the Firearms Act Chapter 10.09.\n\nZiyambi further said the government does not tolerate homicide cases.\n\nGovernment does not want to see homicide cases happening because it is a criminal offence. It is one offence which had a capital punishment life in jail. In the past, it used a death sentence which was given to an offender.\n\nSo, when we look at the issues to do with homicide, you would find that when criminals hear that there are punitive penalties that have been given to perpetrators of homicide, then this would discourage others.\n\nI want to urge the Hon. Member to put in writing his question so that we get clarity and that we also clarify, he said.\n\n",

Benin is a very stubborn and disciplined team, and they usually dont concede. So its going to be a very tough encounter for us, but we have to grind out a positive result.\n\nThe Warriors will be without vice-captain Marshall Munetsi for the Benin clash.
