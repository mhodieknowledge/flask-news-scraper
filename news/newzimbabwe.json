            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nZANU-PF is reviving fading calls for President Emmerson Mnangagwa to extend his rule beyond the constitutionally stipulated two-term limit, with senior officials leading the agenda ahead of the partys conference later this year.\n\nThe ruling party appears divided, with one faction pushing for Mnangagwas continued leadership while another reportedly backs his deputy, Constantino Chiwenga, to succeed him.\n\nMashonaland Provincial Chairperson Daniel Garwe told ZANU-PF supporters in Marondera on Sunday that extending Mnangagwas term was the top priority.\n\nBalance brought forward is vision 2030, resolution number 1, because we are not done with it. That is what we are going with to the districts saying that vision balance brought forward is resolution number 1 because we have not yet fulfilled it then we focus on the other following resolutions.\n\nThat is the guidance that we have here. It is not an insult to anyone, it does not restrict ones opinion, but it is encouraging that we should have the same vision, said Garwe.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa has repeatedly refused to be drawn into discussions about extending his rule, insisting he is serving his final term.\n\nHowever, last years ZANU-PF conference resolved to prolong his tenure despite his public objections.\n\nTo extend Mnangagwas presidency, ZANU-PF would need to overcome constitutional hurdles, including amending Section 91(2), which bars him from running for another term, and Section 382(7), which prevents him from benefiting from such an amendment.\n\nWriting recently on the microblogging platform X, former cabinet minister Tendai Biti vowed that the opposition would resist ZANU-PFs attempts to extend Mnangagwas term.\n\nThey remain unrelenting on their quest for the vulgar 2030 Agenda. They think they can bribe anyone and everyone. The citizen is not anyone and everyone. We will fight back and resist the emasculation of our constitution, rule of law and our dignity, said Biti.\n\n",

He stopped Egyptian opponent Mahmoud Atef (5-3) via TKO (strikes) with just 10 seconds remaining in the opening round.Im feeling great  what an experience to fight in front of my home crowd, my people, friends and family after all these years, said Ndebele, who last fought on South African soil at BRAVE CF 19 in 2018 before forging an international career with the Bahrain-based promotion.I know a lot of people didnt know who Nkosi is. Im just glad they got to see a glimpse of it today. This is only the beginning. That crowd reaction was something else. These are the moments I dream of.When I was backstage, I told my corner, Let me enjoy this moment. I visualise things like this  a huge crowd, and me being happy, and going crazy.To experience that and connect with the fans I just wanted to connect with them more. This is the first time Ive ever experienced such a crowd, a packed arena, a sold-out venue.Ndebele looked composed from the first bell, controlling every aspect of the fight inside the PFL SmartCage. Atef lacked the firepower to trouble the South African and became increasingly hesitant as the strikes piled up.Even when the Egyptian attempted to grapple, Ndebele stayed composed, expertly managing the exchanges with calculated movement, breath control, and positional dominance.Eventually, Ndebele dragged Atef to the canvas and unleashed a flurry of strikes to the body and head. The referee was left with no choice but to wave it off with 10 seconds left in the first round, triggering wild celebrations as chants of Nkosi rang out across the arena.This is only the beginning. More spectacular victories are coming! said a jubilant Ndebele. I am meant for greatness, and this journey with PFL Africa is the path to that greatness.The PFLs African tournament will span four events across the continent in 2024. The new PFL Africa franchise forms part of the organisations global expansion and features 32 fighters from 15 African nations, all competing across four divisions for the inaugural PFL Africa title and a shot at greater opportunities within the PFL system.Saturdays show also included the PFL Champions Series: Road to Dubai card, featuring some of the worlds top MMA talent. Global stars AJ McKee, Corey Anderson, Dakota Ditcheva, Johnny Eblen, Takeshi Izumi, Akhmed Magomedov, and Costello van Steenis all featured under the Grand Arenas bright lights.Following the nights results, the semi-final matchups in the bantamweight division will see Ndebele face Zimbabwes unbeaten Simbarashe Hokonya (6-0), while Boule Godogo (4-0) takes on Karim Henniene (5-0).Saturdays event also hosted the opening round of the heavyweight bracket.

Once we have five or six we will be able to embark on a larger programme and also train our own perfusionists locally, Machawira said.From June 2023 to date, Parirenyatwa Hospital has performed around 55 open heart surgeries.The situation at the referral hospital reflects the state of all public health institutions in Zimbabwe, if not worse and these are the hospitals on which poor people rely.President Emmerson Mnangagwas government has long neglected general hospitals, which now face crumbling infrastructure, shortages of equipment and medicines, and a critical staff shortage due to brain drain occasioned by meagre salaries and poor working conditions.\n\nThis is happening at a time when around 4,500 children are born yearly with congenital heart defects that require open heart surgery while the nation has a waiting list of up to 600 adults suffering from rheumatic heart disease, who also need to undergo the same procedure.\n\nIn addition, the hospital, which handles critical medical cases from across the country, lacks a dedicated cardiothoracic ICU, severely limiting its capacity to perform life saving surgeries on a regular basis.Besides patients requiring open heart surgeries, all other life-threatening illnesses are dealt with in the same single ICU.Speaking to NewZimbabwe.com, specialist cardiovascular and thoracic surgeon Dr. Simukayi Machawira bemoaned lack of trained personnel and resources saying they were limiting the rate at which the life-saving surgeries must be done.At the moment at Parirenyatwa we just have one ICU that addresses the whole hospital, not just cardiothoracic.Ideally, we should have an independent cardiothoracic ICU with 10 beds, then that way we can operate everyday without any impediment.So, this is what we are working towards, we want a fully functional unit, Machawira said.The situation is further worsened by a dire shortage of specialised staff, with the hospital currently relying on only one trained perfusionist, a critical member of the surgical team responsible for operating heart-lung machines during open-heart procedures.We still have one perfusionist, I am happy to say we have secured training for two perfusionists in Tanzania, hopefully we will get a training opportunity for another one in Kenya.

And the number increases as time goes on.\n\nSo we are saying 1,300 plus more each year, which means a large number of children are dying, said Machawira.\n\nHe also noted that for many children born with heart problems, receiving treatment after the age of two has limited impact, as they would have already been debilitated by the illness.\n\nOutside of the two camps with Egyptian specialists, Machawira said Parirenyatwa Hospital has performed around 55 open heart surgeries from June 2023 to date.\n\nZimbabwe has limited capacity to offer open heart surgeries due to a lack of resources and personnel while most patients with heart-related ailments cannot afford treatment abroad, where costs can be as high as US$15,000.\n\n",
