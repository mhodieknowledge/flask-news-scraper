We filed a lot of complaints regarding the problems and risks posed by his dogs. Unfortunately, the more you reprimanded him, the more he would show his arrogant side, said one neighbour.\n\nWhen NewZimbabwe.com visited Bluffhill, a ramshackle kennel in which Mupinga kept his four dogs, the perimeter wall too short to secure the dangerous animals.\n\nEfforts to lobby authorities over the viciousness of the pitbulls fell on deaf ears, with officials turning a blind eye to Mupinga.\n\nElijah Machara, who was the first to find his uncles body, said the death had shaken the family.\n\nI was told by a neighbour to come and check on an unconscious body. When I got closer, I found Uncle Samuel dead. He had a deep cut on his neck, and my worst fear became reality  he was dead, said Machara.\n\nMachara is the latest victim in a rising number of fatal pitbull attacks, raising concerns about the safety and coexistence of pitbulls and people.\n\nAn estimated 12 countries worldwide have banned pitbull ownership, and there are growing calls for Zimbabwe to impose similar restrictions.\n\nHarare Mayor Jacob Mafume, in a social media post, said the City Council is working on regulating pitbulls.\n\nWe have raised concerns. We will explore whether, as council, we can stretch our mandate. Our position is that such dogs are dangerous and must be banned or strictly regulated  like how one would regulate a firearm, said Mafume.\n\n",

Sammons says the two teams will go into that match on an equal footing.\n\nI think South Africa have a great chance of taking that World Test Championship final. Two evenly matched teams. Its going to be a really good game and ultimately it will be decided by the batting unit that can fare best against two quality bowling attacks, he predicted.\n\nThe former Proteas batting consultant is also quite excited to be facing his native nation over the next few days.\n\nThis will also serve as good preparation for the official test series that the neighbours will play at the end of this month in Bulawayo.\n\nThe next four days against South Africa offer our team an amazing opportunity to prepare for what promises to be an exciting and challenging winter, with two tests against the same team and another two against New Zealand.\n\nSo the guys are really looking forward to the challenge and obviously the learnings that will come from it.\n\nIt is good for this group and for Zimbabwean cricket in general that theres so much test cricket available for them this year and obviously towards the end of last year. Its where your fundamentals are tested, and as a young group of players, its where youre going to take the greatest amount of learnings, concluded Sammons.\n\nZimbabwe played a one-off test match against England almost two weeks ago, and were ruthlessly beaten by an innings and 45 runs.\n\nThe coach admitted that the occasion got the better of his team, and says that there was a lot of anxiety among the players.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nThe Umkhonto Wesizwe (MK) partys announcement on Tuesday thatFloyd Shivambu had been removed from his position as Secretary-Generalduring a press briefing has ignited debate about the stability and governance of the MK party, which has long been perceived as a volatile and informal organisation.\n\nDuring a tense press briefing in Durban, the party said the decision follows an internal investigation into Shivambus recent trip to Malawi, which officials say contravened the partys constitution and raised questions about leadership discipline within the organisation.\n\nAccording to MK party officials, Shivambus visit to Malawi to meet withfugitive pastor Shepherd BushirisEnlightened Church was the catalyst for his dismissal.\n\nThe partys statement confirmed that the trip was unauthorised and inconsistent with its constitutional guidelines, which explicitly prohibit members from engaging in activities that could undermine the partys integrity or expose it to external scrutiny.\n\nThe partys leadership cited the trip as emblematic of deeper systemic issues, namely, a leadership style characterised by unpredictability, casual decision-making, and a lack of institutional discipline.\n\nIndependent political analyst Sandile Swana weighed in on the implications of Shivambus removal, drawing parallels to the leadership patterns associated with former President Jacob Zuma.\n\nI have observed that part of the HR strategies of Jacob Zumawhere even when he was the President of the State, ministers and top officials were often removed abruptlymirror what we are seeing in the MK party, Swana said.\n\nIts a pattern of instability and informal governance. Leadership positions are often shifted overnight, with little transparency or consistency.\n\nSwana further argued that this informal style fosters an environment where leadership is unpredictable.\n\nThe character of the MK partys leadership resembles Zumas era  characterised by casualness and personal loyalty rather than institutional stability.\n\nThis creates a fragile political landscape where alliances are fleeting, and leadership is often driven by personal whims rather than strategic planning, he added.\n\nSanet Solomon, a political analyst from the University of the Free States Department of Political Studies and Governance, expressed concern about Shivambus removals broader implications.\n\nThe decision to recall Shivambu was not entirely unexpected, especially given the controversy surrounding his Malawi trip, she said.\n\nSuch actions risk alienating voters and could negatively impact the partys prospects in upcoming elections.\n\nSolomon criticised MKs apparent lack of precise succession planning, noting that the partys leadership operates casually and informally.\n\nThis pattern of instability suggests a leadership style that is personal rather than institutional, which can be detrimental to the partys credibility and long-term viability, she warned.\n\nThe ousting of Shivambu has raised questions about the future direction of the MK party. Analysts speculate the party may be heading into profound introspection or further instability.\n\nSome political commentators suggest that the leaderships decision to remove Shivambu rather than confront him publicly reflects a strategic attempt to avoid further internal dissent.\n\nHowever, critics argue that such moves only deepen the perception of disorder within the MK party, especially given the partys history of leadership upheaval and infighting.\n\nSwana pointed out the parallels between MKs leadership chaos and Zumas style of governance, adding another layer of complexity.\n\nThe informal and personal nature of MKs leadership echoes Zumas approach  where loyalty and personal connections often trump institutional norms, Swana said.\n\nThis could indicate that the party is becoming a mirror of Zumas political style, which may have long-term consequences for its stability.\n\n",

Hundreds of families fled their homes.\n\nAccording to the Zimbabwe Migrants Support Network (ZiMSN) chairperson Chris Mapingure, 127 people have now opted for voluntary repatriation after appearing in the Kirkwood Magistrates Court on Monday.\n\nThe Zimbabwean consulate is arranging transport back to Zimbabwe.\n\nMapingure condemned the arrests coming so soon after the xenophobic attacks. People had lost loved ones and some lost their property. Most lost their travel documents and will need time and money to replace the documents. This is unfair and unfortunate. People were supposed to be given an opportunity to collect their belongings and time to mourn and bury the dead.\n\nPolice spokesperson Captain Andre Beetge told GroundUp that the arrests were conducted by immigration officers from the Department of Home Affairs and the South African Police Service only provided the holding cells.\n\nThe deadly xenophobic attacks last weekend are under investigation by police. There have been no arrests.\n\nWarrant officer Majola Nkohli told GroundUp charges of intimidation and conspiracy to commit crime had been added to the docket. There is information coming out, some in the form of voice notes, which have been elements of intimidation and conspiracy to commit crime during the unrest, Nkohli said.\n\nThe leader of the South African National Civic Organisation (SANCO) in the Sundays River Valley, Patrick Bayeni, said the situation in Addo has calmed down and it is safe for the remaining Zimbabwean families to return.\n\nWe have members on the ground there to monitor the situation and assure whoever wants to return to come back without any fear, he said.\n\nHe said the father of the South African man whose murder triggered the violent revenge attacks has also urged the community not to harm immigrant community members.\n\nGroundUp sent questions to the Department of Home Affairs and Minister of Home Affairs Leon Schreiber but had received no response at the time of publication.\n\n",
