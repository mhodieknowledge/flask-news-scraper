Why do they want to partner on this facility, which is almost complete? he said.\n\nIn 2022, giant energy company Sakunda Holdings approached council with an offer to have a lease agreement on the facility, but was turned down.\n\n",

Police brutality and political purges targeting opposition members and concerned citizens are rampant. Vital institutions are being hijacked by individuals to serve their interests, and undermining the foundations of our society, he said.\n\nThe opposition leader accused the governments policies of creating a stark divide, leaving the majority impoverished and the economy on a freefall, which has escalated citizens hardship.\n\nWe also discussed the internal instability in Zanu PF and its potential to further destabilise the country. We are preparing for all possible outcomes, and we are determined to ensure that any power vacuum is filled by a government that represents the will of the people, he added.\n\n",

Baba challenged us both that day to do bigger things for Africa stuff you guys can now do!\n\nThe turning point came when he attended a panel discussion where multiple speakers claimed Africa would remain a mere consumer of AI because the cost of computing power was beyond the continents reach.\n\nSitting there, I thought to myself, If Aliko can raise $19 billion, surely I should be able to raise a few billion dollars to get AI Compute started in Africa. After all, we already have most of the key components right here in our own companies!\n\nMasiyiwa revealed that when he later mentioned his idea to Dangote and their mutual friend, Prof Benedict Oramah, the President of Afreximbank, they both encouraged him to pursue it.\n\nWhen I mentioned this to Aliko the next time we met, this time together with our friend Prof Oramah of Afreximbank, they were egging me on to do it.\n\nMy brother, you got this. Its your field now. If you cant do it, then who? Aliko joked before adding: Dont forget Nigeria!\n\nProf [as we call Prof Oramah] as usual just said, We are always there for you as Afreximbank, even though you will also have to go global for such funding. Thats how he has spoken to me for over 30 years now,Masiyiwa said.\n\nNow, in partnership with Nvidia, Masiyiwas Cassava Technologies is launching Project Mufungi, an initiative that will establish high-performance AI computing infrastructure across Africa.\n\nOur AI factory provides the infrastructure for this innovation to scale, empowering African businesses, startups, and researchers with access to cutting-edge AI infrastructure to turn their bold ideas into real-world breakthroughs. And now they dont have to look beyond Africa to get it,Masiyiwa said.\n\nThe move also comes amid increasing interest in Africas digital infrastructure from global technology firms.\n\nWith backing from partners like Nvidia and Afreximbank, the project is expected to catalyze further investments in Africas digital economy, helping to close the AI divide between the continent and the rest of the world.\n\n",

The civic money not exceed US$1 per child, reads part of the letter.\n\nHowever, ARTUZ has vehemently criticised the Ministry of Educations use of civic days as a fundraising strategy, arguing that these celebrations have been reduced to partisan Zanu-PF events.\n\nThey maintain that, whilst many value the sacrifices made in liberating Zimbabwe, they can no longer associate themselves with these events. To ARTUZ, the situation smacks of political opportunism.\n\nARTUZ further suggested that the independence celebrations would provide fertile ground for Mnangagwas supporters, the 2030ists, to further their agenda of keeping him in power beyond his constitutional term limit, which is expected to end in 2028.\n\nIt is unethical and illegal for the government to force schools to fund the partisan junket dedicated to the violation of the constitution, ARTUZ wrote on X.\n\nZimbabwes schools are severely underfunded because of governments neglect. The parents are bearing the burden of funding education in violation of section 75 of the Constitution which mandates the government to provide state funded basic education.\n\nIt is cruel for Mnangagwas government to extract from the incapacitated schools. We urge school heads to refuse to participate in this illegality. We stand ready to defend our schools from abuse.\n\nFormer Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) party spokesperson commented that Zanu-PF has reduced key events into internal partisan programmes, making it difficult for other citizens to participate.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the state and the party are conflated.

            "content": "AFP\n\nWorld Athletics said on Tuesday it had approved the introduction of a cheek swab test to determine if anathlete is biologically female.\n\nSebastian Coe, the president of the international track and field federation, said the test, whose introduction was given the green light by the World Athletics Council, was a really important way of protecting the female category.\n\nIts important to do it because it maintains everything that weve been talking about, and particularly recently, about not just talking about the integrity of female womens sport, but actually guaranteeing it, Coe said in a press conference after the Council met over two days in Nanjing, China following the World Indoor Championships.\n\nWe feel this is a really important way of providing confidence and maintaining that absolute focus on the integrity of competition, he added.\n\nWorld Athletics has not fixed a date for the introduction of the test, but it is expected to be in place for the outdoor World Championships in Tokyo this September.\n\nCoe said the decision to introduce the swab testing was taken after a wide consultation on the proposal.\n\nOverwhelmingly, the view has come back that this is absolutely the way to go, Coe said, adding that the swab test was not considered to be overly intrusive.\n\nHe said he was confident that the policy could stand up to legal challenge, but added: You accept the fact that that is the world we live in.\n\nI would never have set off down this path to protect the female category in sport if Id been anything other than prepared to take the challenge head on.\n\nWeve been to the Court of Arbitration on our DSD (difference of sex development) regulations.\n\nThey have been upheld, and they have again been upheld after appeal. So we will doggedly protect the female category, and well do whatever is necessary to do it. And were not just talking about it.\n\nWorld Athletics is looking at cheek swab tests but is also considering using blood spot tests.\n\nThe test for the SRY gene, which is almost always on the male Y chromosome and is used as a highly accurate proxy for biological sex, would need to be taken just once by an athlete during their career, the federation says.\n\nCoe warned during his campaign to be elected International Olympic Committee president that we run the risk of losing womens sport unless the female category was protected.\n\nThe Briton finished third in the race last week which was won byKirsty Coventry, the former Olympic swimmer from Zimbabwe.\n\n",
