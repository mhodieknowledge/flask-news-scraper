Chinas clear assessment and policy response to the current international situation at the political and security level, and it contributes Chinese wisdom and a stabilizing force to resolving international security dilemmas.Muchinguri-Kashiri made the remarks on Friday at a reception held by the Chinese embassy in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, ahead of the 76th anniversary of the founding of the Peoples Republic of China, which falls on Oct. 1.We wish to reaffirm our governments support for the recently announced Global Governance Initiative and all the other initiatives spearheaded by China, she said.Muchinguri-Kashiri said relations between Zimbabwe and China have soared, which is evidenced by the elevation of ties to an all-weather community with a shared future during Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwas recent visit to China.The two leaders concurred that the five-star ironclad friendship has steadily deepened and has set an example for solidarity and coordination between China and Africa as well as the Global South, she said.Over the years, the level of economic cooperation between our two countries has soared to greater heights as evidenced by the implementation and commissioning of various programs in the health, energy, agriculture, infrastructure development, and ICT sectors, among others, said Muchinguri-Kashiri.She said the two countries have signed three protocols to facilitate the export of Zimbabwean citrus, avocados, and blueberries to China, and the southern African country is looking forward to more products entering the Chinese market.She also applauded China for providing scholarships to Zimbabwean students and training to professionals, noting that education, scientific and technological development are key drivers to enhance Zimbabwes capabilities in all sectors of the economy.Let us work closely together to further consolidate and drive forward the excellent and mutually beneficial cooperation between our two friendly nations and achieve new milestones in our bilateral relations, Muchinguri-Kashiri added.\n\nThe GGI reflects Chinas clear assessment and policy response to the current international
