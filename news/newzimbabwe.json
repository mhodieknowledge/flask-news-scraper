            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) has denied allegations of cruelty towards two lions housed at Chinhoyi Caves in Mashonaland West province.\n\nVisitors to the Ramsar world heritage site at Chinhoyi Caves have raised concern online over the unfavorable conditions the two lions one named Dingani, a 13-year-old male, and Laila, a 6-year-old female are being kept. They say the enclosure is too tiny while at times the stressed animals go without food and water.In response to the growing online concerns of poor animal welfare, ZimParks said plans are afoot to engage relevant teams and partners to address the issues raised.ZimParks acting spokesperson Tamiriraishe Mudzingwa said the two lions are receiving sufficient care and treatment despite being kept in separate enclosures.ZimParks remains committed to maintaining the highest standards of hospitality, safety, and conservation, the authority said.At present, there are two lions at Chinhoyi Caves: Dingani, a 13-year-old male, and Laila, a 6-year-old female.The two lions are currently housed separately, a decision made purely for their safety and wellbeing. This arrangement follows the males aggressive behaviour toward the female, and our teams are managing a gradual and carefully supervised reintroduction process, said Mudzingwa.The statement follows a plethora of social media posts alleging that two lions housed at Chinhoyi Caves are malnourished, poorly fed, and sometimes go without water. Critics also claimed the enclosures were too small, with some commentators describing the conditions particularly for the female lion as animal cruelty.ZimParks assured the public that its teams are monitoring the animals closely and that ongoing improvements are being made to address public concerns.\n\nVisitors to the Ramsar world heritage site at Chinhoyi Caves have raised concern online over the unfavorable conditions the two lions one named Dingani, a 13-year-old male, and Laila, a 6-year-old female are being kept.

            "content": "By Irish Times\n\nCARE workers from Zimbabwe, who allege they paid thousands of euro each to a recruiter to secure work permits, have told a tribunal of living in freezing shared accommodation without their wages after the jobs they were promised in the Republic failed to materialise.\n\nTestifying to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) this week, one of the workers said she was threatened with having her work permit cancelled when she asked about going to another job she was offered.Another said she was left without income for months and had to eventually leave a staff house when the landlord arrived, threatening to change the locks.Shingirirai Chiwaridzo, Nombeko Hlabangana, Brenda Mubaiwa, Tatenda Ncube, Allen Phillip Ndhlovu, Nicola Sibanda, Nobuhle Sibanda and Agapao Munashe Zvihari are each pursuing complaints under the Payment of Wages Act 1991 against their former employer, Unity Healthcare Services Ltd.The Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland (MRCI), which is representing the six women and two men, says they are owed months of unpaid wages each, plus repayment of sums allegedly charged to procure their work permits. The company is disputing the complaints.Giving evidence to the WRC, the workers said they were approached in Zimbabwe and paid fees of between 2,000 and 3,600 to Unity Healthcare or one of its directors in 2022 or 2023.Giving evidence, worker Nobuhle Sibanda said Unity Healthcare chief executive Londiwe Maphosa quoted her 1,000 to secure a work permit and informed her she would have to pay 3,000 in total when accommodation costs were factored in.I couldnt raise the whole amount. I raised 2,600, Ms Sibanda said in evidence. An offer letter, contract and non-disclosure agreement were sent to her after she wired the money to Ms Maphosas co-director in the firm, Bruce Magama.Most of the group flew to Ireland at their own expense in December 2023 or January 2024 after being told they were going to be starting work within weeks at a care facility that was set to open in Virginia, Co Cavan, they said.The pay on offer was in the region of 560 a week on a base hourly rate of 15 an hour, the tribunal heard.Several of the workers moved into a staff house Unity had rented near the centre and training was held for some, but the jobs failed to materialise, the tribunal heard.The company director, Mr Magama, told the hearing the centres opening had been delayed, and referred to attempts to arrange employment elsewhere for workers.He said one healthcare firm had been willing to take staff, but Ms Sibanda said her understanding was that the other company had made it clear that it was not taking anyone from Unity Healthcare.The tribunal was told that at one point, seven workers were living communally in the staff house, some two to a bedroom, others bedding down in its diningroom.Another worker, Agapau Munashe Zvihari, said her mother had arranged temporary lodgings for her in Galway, but after the delays, her landlady said: We have to go to Cavan and see if you have this job.Her landlady had formed the view that the company was being run by scammers, she said. When she spoke to Ms Maphosa, she was told: You signed an NDA [non-disclosure agreement]. Why are you talking to these people youre staying with about our company?Ms Chiwaridzo said the workers at the staff house were scared to talk.Ms Maphosa  who was married to Mr Magama, the witness said  came to the house on one occasion and shouted at us for answering questions from another worker about the opening of the centre.Some of the workers were able to earn small amounts of money cleaning houses or doing childminding, the tribunal heard.Several workers gave evidence that the company undertook to pay them 100 a week while they were waiting for work, but that this arrangement stopped after three weeks, and some further small ad hoc sums were given to some who complained about financial circumstances.However, others said they received no money at all from the company which had brought them to the Republic for work.Ms Chiwaridzo said the workers living at the staff house pooled their resources to try to pay for electricity, food and heating. It was just not enough, she said.Under questioning by Mr Magama, she said the businessman had been sending money for food from January to March 2024 and making some contributions to the heating bill, but not consistently.Ms Chiwaridzo said she needed a letter of no objection from Unity Healthcare, as the sponsor of her work permit, to release her and allow her to take up another employment contract.It took from first asking in March 2024 to October that year to get the letter  by which time two job offers had fallen through, she said.Brenda Mubaiwa said she had left kids at home to come to to the Republic and work, but had only ever been paid 300 by Unity Healthcare. Ms Mubaiwa said that to pay for her son to sit exams, her mother had resorted to borrowing money.The workers were giving evidence to the WRC on Thursday. The matter has been adjourned by adjudication officer Breiffni ONeill, who will hear the evidence of a ninth complainant at a later date.Pretty Ndawo and Sylwia Nowakowska of the MRCI appeared for the workers.

An offer letter, contract and non-disclosure agreement were sent to her after she wired the money to Ms Maphosas co-director in the firm, Bruce Magama.Most of the group flew to Ireland at their own expense in December 2023 or January 2024 after being told they were going to be starting work within weeks at a care facility that was set to open in Virginia, Co Cavan, they said.The pay on offer was in the region of 560 a week on a base hourly rate of 15 an hour, the tribunal heard.Several of the workers moved into a staff house Unity had rented near the centre and training was held for some, but the jobs failed to materialise, the tribunal heard.The company director, Mr Magama, told the hearing the centres opening had been delayed, and referred to attempts to arrange employment elsewhere for workers.He said one healthcare firm had been willing to take staff, but Ms Sibanda said her understanding was that the other company had made it clear that it was not taking anyone from Unity Healthcare.The tribunal was told that at one point, seven workers were living communally in the staff house, some two to a bedroom, others bedding down in its diningroom.Another worker, Agapau Munashe Zvihari, said her mother had arranged temporary lodgings for her in Galway, but after the delays, her landlady said: We have to go to Cavan and see if you have this job.Her landlady had formed the view that the company was being run by scammers, she said. When she spoke to Ms Maphosa, she was told: You signed an NDA [non-disclosure agreement]. Why are you talking to these people youre staying with about our company?Ms Chiwaridzo said the workers at the staff house were scared to talk.Ms Maphosa  who was married to Mr Magama, the witness said  came to the house on one occasion and shouted at us for answering questions from another worker about the opening of the centre.Some of the workers were able to earn small amounts of money cleaning houses or doing childminding, the tribunal heard.Several workers gave evidence that the company undertook to pay them 100 a week while they were waiting for work, but that this arrangement stopped after three weeks, and some further small ad hoc sums were given to some who complained about financial circumstances.However, others said they received no money at all from the company which had brought them to the Republic for work.Ms Chiwaridzo said the workers living at the staff house pooled their resources to try to pay for electricity, food and heating. It was just not enough, she said.Under questioning by Mr Magama, she said the businessman had been sending money for food from January to March 2024 and making some contributions to the heating bill, but not consistently.Ms Chiwaridzo said she needed a letter of no objection from Unity Healthcare, as the sponsor of her work permit, to release her and allow her to take up another employment contract.It took from first asking in March 2024 to October that year to get the letter  by which time two job offers had fallen through, she said.Brenda Mubaiwa said she had left kids at home to come to to the Republic and work, but had only ever been paid 300 by Unity Healthcare. Ms Mubaiwa said that to pay for her son to sit exams, her mother had resorted to borrowing money.The workers were giving evidence to the WRC on Thursday.

The conditions have necessitated a tight monetary policy stance and a commitment to maintain the grip on money supply.Presenting the groups performance for the half years period ended September 30 2025, Delta board chairman, Todd Moyo acknowledged the positive impact of stable exchange rates on product sales.The Group benefited from a relatively stable operating environment during the half-year period under review. Consumer spending remained strong, driven by a stable ZWG exchange rate, the record-breaking tobacco marketing season, increased mining activities and the firm mineral prices, particularly gold.Diaspora remittances are also benefiting from the firming of cross exchange rates such as the Rand and Pound, our key source markets, he said.During the period, group revenue for the half year at US$514 million increased by 32% compared to the prior year, reflecting volume growth across the Zimbabwe business units and the inclusion of Schweppes as a subsidiary.The revenue growth was weighed down by the price moderations in the Sparkling Beverages business, which partly absorbed the sugar tax to maintain volume and competitiveness. The proportion of domestic sales undertaken in foreign currency was 92% during the period under review.Moyo said the Zimbabwe Gold (ZWG), was relatively stable during the half year, reducing the level of rate estimation for compliance with IFRS and IAS 21. The rates used at the reporting date were within the ranges allowed by the monetary regulations.Profit After Tax (PAT) surged by nearly 83% to US$75,05 million for the six months ended September 30, 2025, largely driven by robust revenue growth of 32% and a sharp decline in exchange losses.Lager beer volumes rose 21%, supported by stronger consumer incomes and stable pricing.The sorghum beer category expanded 16%, buoyed by firm demand from mining communities and commercial agriculture, while sparkling beverages registered an 11% increase, reflecting modest recovery amid sugar tax pressures.Delta subsidiary, African Distillers Limited, delivered the strongest outturn, with overall volumes up 43%led by wine (59%), ready-to-drink beverages (47%) and spirits (36%).\n\nThe ZWG currency has sustained stability for most part of 2025, sustaining an exchange rate premium of US$1:ZWG27 since its last major depreciation in September 2024.

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nSpeaker of Parliament Jacob Mudenda has directed Parliamentary Portfolio Committees to stop undertaking unnecessary trips that have left the National Assembly nearly empty during sittings, depriving constituents of representation.\n\nMudenda expressed displeasure after noticing numerous empty seats on both the left and right benches, as many legislators were away on committee trips.\n\nI notice on both sides, on my right and on my left, there are a few members of Parliament. What is going on? Can I have an explanation from the Whips? Mudenda asked.\n\nZanu PF Chief Whip Pupurai Togarepi informed the Speaker that three committees were away.\n\nAs per your directive in this House, there should not be more than two Committees at a moment a week, but sometimes they just go without even advising the Whips. I am supposed to concur with those who arrange these outreaches. When I came in, I realised there were a few members only to be told that these committees would have gone out without my knowledge. We need to sit down with the administration to ensure that we protect attendance.\n\nResponding, Mudenda emphasised that parliamentary attendance must take precedence.\n\nWhile the public hearings are critical, and I do not know why they should arise after we have had public hearings on the Pre-Budget. There is no excuse why these committees should be out. Absolutely no excuse. The priority is for members to be here in the House as representatives of the people. You are the voice of the people who are not able to be in this august House.\n\nNow, if you are not there, how is their voice going to be heard? So, this must stop forthwith from next week. No committees should go out unless absolutely necessary.\n\nIn recent weeks, MPs have been making what observers describe as outrageous demands, claiming that their allowances are insufficient to meet their personal needs. Lawmakers earn extra money when travelling through additional allowances.\n\n",
