            "content": "By Chipo Sabeta\n\nCelebrated gospel artist Mathias Mhere is set to headline the Free to Worship Legacy Concerts in Australia, a series of worship events bringing together believers from around the world for nights of praise, unity, and celebration.\n\nSupported byDiaspora Insurance, the highly anticipated concerts will be held across three major cities next month: Melbourne on November 7, Sydney on November 8, and Perth on November 9, marking one of the most significant international tours for the Free to Worship movement.\n\nFree to Worship began as a small group of passionate singers united by a common mission: to worship God freely. Over the years, the choir, part of ZAOGA Forward in Faith Ministries International (FIFMI),has grown into a globally recognised ensemble of gifted vocalists and musicians who embody the energy, unity, and faith of FIFs vision.\n\nThrough dedication, teamwork, and steadfast partnerships,including long-standing support from Diaspora Insurance,Free to Worship has transformed from humble beginnings into a global phenomenon. The groups mission is to demonstrate that when people are truly free to worship, lives are changed, hearts are healed, and nations are uplifted.\n\nDiaspora Insurance CEO Jeff Madzingo (left), ZAOGA Forward in Faith Australia Bishop Masaka (centre), and Free to Worship Chairman Tawanda Sarireni (right) were recently pictured at the FIFMI Australia Believers Convention, celebrating the enduring partnership between Diaspora Insurance and Free to Worship.\n\nFor over a decade,Diaspora Insurancehas been a faithful partner of the movement, supporting its efforts to spread hope and faith through music.\n\nKnown for their powerful and spirit-filled concerts, Free to Worship events have become landmark gatherings on the FIF calendar, drawing thousands of worshippers across cities and nations. Each concert brings an atmosphere of revival, joy, and community through original music, dynamic praise, and heartfelt worship that transcends cultures and languages.\n\nWe have been praising God from our humble beginnings until now, when we are having sold-out shows, said Chairman Tawanda Sarireni. With Free to Worship concerts selling out and packing arenas over three consecutive years, there has been a longing to see the group live by many overseas fans.\n\nFree to Worship\n\nBeyond the stage, Free to Worship also serves as a training ground for young believers, helping them discover and nurture their God-given musical talents. Many alumni have gone on to inspire others in both local and international ministries, carrying the same anointing and excellence that define the group.\n\nSarireni said the choir continues to unite worship leaders, gospel singers, and instrumentalists from various churches and nations, strengthening the message of unity in faith.\n\nFounded by the late Archbishop Ezekiel Guti, Free to Worship continues to shine as a vessel of praise, reminding believers everywhere that music, faith, and devotion can transform communities and touch nations.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal) to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans living in the diaspora. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. You spoke on sustainable infrastructure development at the CEOAfrica AnnualRoundtable in Victoria Falls. What is your position on sustainable infrastructure development in the African context, considering that Africa is a low global contributor to world pollution?\n\nVM: Thank you\n\nAs a point of correction, I spoke on legal considerations for unlocking finances for sustainable infrastructure development. My focus was really on the different mechanisms available to unlock finance for funding infrastructure projects in Zimbabwe, the continent and around the world.\n\nTo your question, sustainable development is a global reality despite various individual contrary views on whether it is necessary or fair. There is a plethora of legislation and policy entrenched in financing institutions that fund global development projects. They (the financial institutions) have, as a prerequisite, the condition that the projects be conscious of ESGs, being environmental, social impact and governance considerations.\n\nA debate on its necessity, especially as 54 separate African countries, is in my view, an uphill task and the logical thing will be for each to benefit from the funds available and develop the individual countries for the collective benefit\n\nReporter:Lets then start with the continental position. What legal and financial instruments are available for infrastructure development that is sustainable?\n\nVM: We have a number of funds that promote infrastructure development that are premised on sustainability by taking into consideration the environment and social impacts. An example will be Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA), Green Climate Fund and even the African Development Bank also prescribes infrastructure projects to establish sustainability.\n\nThis is not just a continental requirement, even when unlocking global international finance, institutions are guided by the Equator Principles and International Finance Corporation performance standards, which have at their core, requirements for the financing institution to satisfy itself that the projects being funded are environmentally sustainable.\n\nIf we were to also look East, being global financial giants, China in 2021 also implemented the Green Development Guidelines for Overseas Investment and Cooperation and is also considering sustainability in its funding mechanisms.\n\nTo the second part of your question on sustainable infrastructure development, on the continent, we are guided by the African Union Agenda 2063 being a blueprint of Africas structural transformation.\n\nFurther, we also have the Programme for Infrastructure Development (PIDA) with a priority action plan or mandate to give preference to cross-border projects in energy, water and transport, among other things. These projects, as you can see at face value, have serious environmental and social considerations.\n\nThen there is the African Free Trade Organisation, which makes sustainable infrastructure a treaty-based obligation. The harmonisation of the continental laws and individual state laws is now a legal and economic necessity.\n\nReporter: Before discussing what the position in Zimbabwe is, what are the things investors generally consider when investing in infrastructure development?\n\nVM: Well like in every investment transaction, the investor is concerned mainly with whether he or she will attain enforceable rights, whether or not there are predictable timelines within the project and key to all, whether the project has taken into consideration and mitigated against any potential environmental and social impact, allowing maximum protection to the potentially affected.\n\nReporter: What is then our Zimbabwe position in terms of sustainable infrastructure development?\n\nVM: I will reiterate what I said at the CEO roundtable conference, my view is that our laws in terms of sustainable infrastructure development are well developed and competitive on the continent.\n\nSustainability is a constitutional, legislative and policy question in Zimbabwe as it is covered by all pillars of the prescriptive and guidance laws in our country.\n\nOur weakness is that the laws are fragmented and found in various statutes that address the different areas where sustainability is a question. Although the Environmental Management Act is the overarching legislation, aligning with the prescriptive terms of our constitution, other legislation like your Water Act, Electricity Act, ZIDA and many other have sustainability considerations.\n\nThe National Development Strategy 2, commencing in 2026, has put sustainable development goals at the core of its policy.\n\nCountries like Kenya have managed to amalgamate these laws into a single reference legislation, making them more attractive to sustainable infrastructure development financing. Although we have a National Climate Policy, our National Climate Management Bill, which will harmonise these laws, is going through the legislative processes with the objective of having a national reference point.\n\nReporter: Would you then advise that ESGs be part of all sustainable infrastructure development plans for investors? If yes, what would your reasons be?\n\nVM: With the risk of sounding like a broken record, international finance can mostly be accessed by companies that can show project environmental and social impacts, including mitigation and remediation options.\n\nIt therefore widens the areas where the developer can access development finance.\n\nInclusion of ESG considerations future proofs projects because most African countries, with Zimbabwe included, are incorporating or perfecting the laws that deal with climate issues.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr Madzima. We have to end here because of our time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nMOVEMENT for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Douglas Mwonzora has described President Emmerson Mnangagwa as an ungrateful man, as Zanu PFs controversial push to extend the presidents tenure beyond 2028 continues to face mounting opposition.\n\nDespite Mnangagwa publicly rejecting the idea of a term extension beyond the constitutionally mandated two terms, Zanu PF has been spearheading a plan to amend the Constitution to enable him to remain in power.\n\nThe ruling party is reportedly seeking to amend Section 91(2), which bars Mnangagwa from running for a third term, and Section 328(7), which prevents a sitting president from benefiting from such an amendment.\n\nAddressing the media in Harare recently, Mwonzora stopped short of saying Mnangagwa has overstayed his welcome at the helm of the country.\n\nWhy should we give President Mnangagwa who is 83 with another term? He has been Minister since 1980 and he has been President, first completing the tenure of President Mugabe and the two terms that he has been given. He needs to be an ungrateful man to seek anything beyond that, said Mwonzora.\n\nAt the just-ended Zanu PF Peoples Conference in Mutare, the ruling party resolved to fast-track constitutional amendments that would allow Mnangagwa to continue his tenure beyond 2028.\n\nMwonzora said the country has seen no tangible improvement under Mnangagwas leadership, who took over from long-time ruler Robert Mugabe following the 2017 military coup.\n\nThere is nothing special that we have received from his presidency at all. Zimbabweans continue wallowing in poverty, although they say that there is economic development in Zimbabwe. Average Zimbabweans have become poorer. Some Zimbabweans cannot afford a meal a day every day and there is a lot of unemployment, so why should we have a term? said Mwonzora.\n\nAccording to a leaked corruption dossier allegedly authored by Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, Zanu PF is plotting to smuggle a document into Parliament titled the Breaking Barriers Initiative (BBI), which seeks to postpone elections and extend the tenure of the National Assembly until 2030.\n\nThe BBI is reportedly being packaged as a national stability project aimed at helping Zimbabwe move away from the toxic cycle of elections.\n\nMwonzora, however, warned against tampering with the 2013 Constitution, which was overwhelmingly endorsed by citizens in a national referendum.\n\nMDC was an active participant in the drafting of the constitution and it heard the views of the people of Zimbabwe. The people of Zimbabwe want a limited term. Somebody rules the country, is given a second term if possible, then they go home. So we remain opposed to the so-called 2030 agenda, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTigere Property Fund (Tigere REIT) has announced plans to expand its portfolio through the acquisition of two prime retail properties, the Greenfields Retail Centre and Phase 1 of the Zimre Park Retail Centre, for a combined value of approximately US$25.1 million.\n\nThe REIT said the proposed acquisitions are subject to unitholder approval and will be fully funded through the issuance of 770.5 million new Tigere REIT units.\n\nThis marks Tigere REITs second acquisition since its initial public offering (IPO), following the successful purchase of Highland Park Phase 2. The move aligns with the funds strategy of securing high-quality, income-generating real estate assets supported by long-term, US dollar-denominated leases, a key driver for stable returns and capital growth.\n\nThe total acquisition consideration reflects the combined net asset value (NAV) of the target properties. Upon completion, Tigere REITs total units in issue will increase to 1.84 billion, with the newly issued units representing 41.8% of the enlarged unit base.\n\nThe implied issuance price per unit for the transaction stands at US$3.26 cents, representing a 2.536% premium over Tigere REITs NAV per unit of US$3.18 as of June 30, 2025.\n\nThe bulk of the transaction involves the Greenfields Retail Centre, acquired on a leasehold basis. The property, whose development began in December 2024, features 54 tenants across 14,000m of gross lettable area (GLA) and is currently fully occupied.\n\nTigere REIT said the acquisitions will further strengthen its portfolio of high-quality retail assets, supporting consistent returns and sustainable long-term growth for investors.\n\n",

            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nCONSTITUTIONAL law expert Professor Lovemore Madhuku has trashed Zanu PFs attempts to illegally extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas second term to 2030.\n\nDespite initially professing ignorance, analysts believe it is now clear Mnangagwa wants to hang on beyond his constitutionally mandated two terms using a combination of possible legal lacuna, manipulation of constitutional provisions and monetary rewards for Parliamentarians.\n\nMadhuku, who is strongly opposed to the idea, was speaking to online news platform 263Chat.\n\nWe do not know how they intend to do it; they have not indicated how they would want to amend the constitution but what is very clear is that it is not possible to ensure that when the presidents term ends in 2028, he remains in office beyond 2028, said Madhuku.\n\nThere is no legal mechanism of doing it as it currently stands.\n\nPassed as a resolution at Zanu PFs Bulawayo congress in 2024, extending Mnangagwas term has dominated Zimbabwean politics since then, further dividing an already fragile society that is still traumatised by late President Robert Mugabes lengthy stay in power.\n\nMugabe was in power for 37 years, eventually losing power in a military-backed coup in 2017.\n\nWith Section 91 (2) limiting Presidents stay in office to two five-year terms and demanding a referendum to change it, Zanu PF is understood to have devised a way around it, completely avoiding the general populations involvement.\n\nAdded Madhuku: The kind of amendments they are talking about are not possible without a referendum. There are a few things you can amend without going for a referendum but if you want to tamper with the term of office of the president, the exercise of executive powers or the structure of the state, you cannot avoid a referendum.\n\nThis idea of avoiding a referendum means that they know that this proposal is not popular with the people.\n\nExiled former government minister, Jonathan Moyo, who is behind a document (Breaking Barriers Initiative) said to not just map the way for Zanu PF but suspend elections, believes Mnangagwas term can legally be lengthened without going to a referendum.\n\nA well-respected think-tank, Moyos work with Zanu PF indicates a party determined to extend Mnangagwas term, which will mean shutting the door of succession on his deputy Constantino Chiwenga, who is eagerly waiting for a shot at the presidency.\n\nThe Constitutions sole presidential term limit on the officeholder lies in Section 91(2)s two-term bar, which would remain untouched by a term length amendment to Section 95(2)(b), said Moyo on X.\n\nAmending section 95(2)(b) to seven years, for instance, would simply recalibrate this flexible duration, enabling the extension to 2030 via a two-thirds vote in each House in Parliamentfree from the dictates of sections 328(6) (9).\n\nProfessor Lovemore Madhuku\n\nAttempts to extend Mnangagwas stay are part of factional fights within the ruling party.\n\nMnangagwas continued stay will be a boon for his preferred successor, businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei, who recently joined the partys powerful Central Committee.\n\nFor Chiwenga, it would mean going back to the drawing board, or as some have predicted, planning and executing another coup as he did in 2017.\n\nIt is wrong for any political party on its own to want to impose a constitution on the people, added Madhuku.\n\nTerm limits are actually imposed to limit very good presidents. They were invented to ensure that a person would not remain in office merely because they were doing wellwhich is why some of the best presidents have had to leave.\n\nTerm limits are for good presidents; you do not need term limits for a poor president who will obviously be removed in an election.\n\n",
