Honourable Sikhala was subsequently arrested and is currently detained at Pretoria central prison, the groups spokesperson Silenkosi Moyo said.\n\nThe NDWG said its legal team was actively engaged on-site to secure the opposition leaders defence.\n\nWe categorically maintain that the explosives found do not belong to him, the statement added.\n\nAs the National Democratic Working Group, we stand unwaveringly beside our leader and reaffirm our commitment to defending him through all legal means available.\n\nThe group appealed to the public to keep Sikhala in their thoughts and prayers during what it described as challenging times.\n\nSikhalas arrest in South Africa comes less than a year after his release from detention in Zimbabwe, where he was arrested for allegedly inciting public violence. Rights groups and opposition figures previously accused the Harare government of persecuting him for his political activism.\n\nSikhala remains one of the most vocal critics of Zanu PF, continuing to speak out against corruption and human rights abuses in Zimbabwe.\n\nHis latest arrest has sparked fresh concern among Zimbabweans in the diaspora and raised questions about the circumstances surrounding his detention in South Africa.\n\nOn the other hand, other sections of the Zimbabwean society accuse Sikhala of being involved in crime, and celebrated his arrest in Pretoria.\n\n",
