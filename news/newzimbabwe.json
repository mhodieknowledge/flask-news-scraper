South Africa has become the destination for many, with a large number living and working there, some without legal documentation.\n\nSpeaking on theSABC programmeFace The Nation, Hamadziripi explained that the movement of Zimbabweans to South Africa has historical roots.\n\nMigration from Zimbabwe to South Africa is not a recent phenomenon. It is historical, and we can go back many years to see this pattern. Zimbabwe is not the only country with nationals who come to South Africa. Migration is an individual decision, driven by various factors. Even in countries considered the best to live in, people migrate for better prospects,Hamadziripi said.\n\nWhen asked about theZimbabwean governmentsresponsibility in addressing the economic challenges that force citizens to leave, Hamadziripi noted:\n\nThe government of Zimbabwe is taking all measures it can to improve the economic situation in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe influx of Zimbabweans into South Africa has sparked controversy over the years, with concerns about the strain on the countrys resources. In August 2022, Limpopos then-Health MEC, Phophi Ramathuba, made headlines for her remarks about Zimbabwean migrants overburdening the provincial healthcare system.\n\nRamathuba told a Zimbabwean patient at a Bela Bela hospital that South Africas healthcare system was not a charity. She added that foreign nationals were not accounted for in the provincial budget.\n\nHer comments drew widespread backlash, with the Zimbabwean embassy expressing dismay and urging diplomatic dialogue to resolve the issue.\n\n",

I saw her, I saw her. She can just do it now, rather than sitting there, she can just do it now. Can you ask her to do it now?\n\nBlood pressure check dispute\n\nThe tension escalates as the patients camera pans to a second nurse, who is accused of neglecting to check the patients blood pressure.\n\nIn the exchange, the nurse claims, I dont check BP, prompting the patient to ask, What do you do?\n\nThe nurses reply, I sleep, move around, and eat a lot, draws a sharp rebuke from the patient, who comments on the nurses weight: That is why you are fat.\n\nPatients frustration and nurses defiance\n\nThe patient, growing frustrated, states, They said she must write me a transfer. She is not No, I came here what time? I cant wait anymore. Write me a transfer, let me go to the doctor.\n\nThe nurse, however, refuses, responding defiantly, I wont write you a transfer. Shout as much as you want, let everyone hear you. I wont write you. Take a pic, here, sue me, post me, I will sue the f*** out of you.\n\nPublic outcry and calls for accountability\n\nThe video has since ignited a firestorm of reactions online, with many expressing outrage at the nurses unprofessional behaviour.\n\nCritics have called for accountability and urged health authorities to investigate the incident thoroughly.\n\nMeanwhile, others argued that the patient was very rude.\n\nBroader implications for healthcare\n\nSouth Africas healthcare system has long faced scrutiny over allegations of poor treatment and strained resources, particularly for foreign nationals seeking medical care.\n\nIn 2022, the then Limpopo Health MEC Phophi Ramathuba stirred significant controversy when a video surfaced of her telling a woman that migrants from Zimbabwe placed a huge strain on the provincial healthcare system.\n\nThis latest incident has intensified debates about the quality of service and the treatment of non-citizens in the countrys healthcare facilities.\n\n",

            "content": "By VOA\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  Zimbabwes ruling party says it will initiate steps to amend the constitution so President Emmerson Mnangagwa can run for a third term in the 2028 elections. The opposition is strongly opposed to amending the 2013 constitution, which limited presidents to two five-year terms.\n\nIn an interview with VOA, Ziyambi Ziyambi, Zimbabwes minister of justice, legal and parliamentary affairs, said the government is ready to move forward once lawmakers introduce the bill to amend the constitution.\n\nIs there a prohibition in amending anything in the constitution? Ziyambi said. The only prohibition, the only clause that I know in the constitution, it says any electoral amendments have to be done six months before an election for that amendment to be used in the coming election. Anything else Im not aware.\n\nLovemore Madhuku, a law professor at the University of Zimbabwe and an opposition leader, said it will be difficult though not impossible for the ruling Zanu-PF party to change the constitution in time for its leader to run in the 2028 election.\n\nLegally, yes you can go through the steps, Madhuku said. The steps will require a publication of the first bill, give Zimbabweans a 90-day period to debate it. Thereafter, take it to parliament. It must get a two-thirds majority, and thereafter there must be a referendum. That alone tells you that it is very difficult. It cannot be assumed that since Zanu-PF has a two-thirds majority [in parliament], they will obtain the two-thirds majority.\n\nDouglas Mwonzora, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change party, said the MDC will campaign vehemently against the bid to have Mnangagwa stand for a third term.\n\nMwonzora, who is a lawyer, said one referendum will not suffice for Mnangagwa to stand in 2028.\n\nThey will need another referendum, Mwonzora said. This time specifically, stating whether or not President Mnangagwa must stand again and these two referendums must not be within six months of one another.\n\nWe will campaign for a no vote again not because we have anything personal against President Mnangagwa, we think that President Mnangagwa after his term should go and rest, we think its time for other leaders, so we will campaign no in that regard.\n\nBut Ziyambi said Zanu-PF will overcome all obstacles in the way of Mnangagwas third term.\n\nZanu-PF is a mass party. Our structures are to the grassroot from village level, so when we are doing resolutions, thats where they start, Ziyambi said. Its not the top leadership that say that they want anything.\n\nZiyambi said Mnangagwa said he has been clear that he wants to abide by the constitution, but the push for the resolution to allow him to run for a third term is coming from the grassroots level.\n\nPresident Robert Mugabe ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years before Mnangagwa, a former army general and Mugabes vice president took power in a 2017 coup.\n\nMnangagwa is 82 years old and is currently the fifth oldest head of state in Africa.\n\n",

Mellon Auditorium beneath towering 62-foot columns.\n\nClad in black tie and ball gowns, guests noshed on miniature lobster rolls and Trumps favored McDonalds burgers and fries, according to social media posts and two attendees who spoke to Reuters.\n\nIn addition to Snoop Dogg, the entertainment lineup featured rappers Rick Ross and Soulja Boy, the attendees said. One of many Washington celebrations ahead of Trumps Monday swearing-in, the crypto gala marks a stunning turnaround for an industry that has been in the Biden administrations crosshairs.\n\nTwo years ago, it looked to be on the brink of extinction amid the collapse of FTX. Trump, who did not attend the gala, courted crypto campaign cash with promises to be a crypto president, and is expected next week to issue executive orders aimed at reducing crypto regulatory roadblocks and promoting widespread adoption of digital assets.\n\nThere were a lot of dark years, said Les Borsai, co-founder of the crypto investment adviser Wave Digital Assets, who flew in from Los Angeles.\n\nIf this signifies what the future looks like  I think thats the optimism weve been waiting for.\n\nSwag included Make Bitcoin Great Again red baseball caps, and American flag pins with the symbol for Gemini, an event sponsor and crypto exchange founded by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who backed Trumps campaign.\n\nSOLD OUT\n\nTickets sold out at $2,500 each for general admission, the balls website said, but for a cool $100,000, VIP packages provided face time with tech entrepreneur David Sacks, Trumps incoming crypto czar and the galas emcee, according to attendees and crypto media outlets.\n\nAbout 1,500 people attended. Several other officials from Trumps incoming administration were also present, the attendees said.\n\nOther sponsors included the digital asset division of Robinhood, MicroStrategy and Crypto.com, according to the event website.\n\nSponsors had cocktails named in their honor.\n\nLast night was truly a testament to how mainstream crypto has become, said JP Richardson, CEO of Exodus, which co-hosted the ball.\n\nWhile the industry was reveling, Trump on Friday night expanded his cryptocurrency interests, which already include World Liberty Financial, by launching a digital token branded with an image from his attempted assassination in July.\n\nThe price of that meme coin was around $27 by Saturday afternoon, giving it a market capitalization of about $5.5 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.\n\nWorried about fraud and money laundering, President Joe Bidens regulators cracked down on crypto companies, suing exchanges Coinbase, Binance, Kraken and dozens more in federal court.\n\nTrumps crypto policy team is taking shape, with his crypto-friendly Securities and Exchange Commission chair pick Paul Atkins expected to forge major crypto policy changes.\n\nThe crypto voter showed up in the election and this event signifies a turning point for crypto policy in the United States, Jonathan Jachym, global head of policy at Kraken, said in a statement.\n\nBitcoin, the worlds largest cryptocurrency, hit new records above $107,000 in December on excitement over Trumps policy changes.\n\nWe are proud to support the Crypto Ball  and look forward to supporting the new administration to advance innovation in digital assets, said a spokesperson for Crypto.com, adding the companys president of North America, Matt David, attended.\n\nRepresentatives for the Trump administration, Robinhood, MicroStrategy, Gemini and the events other two hosts, BTC Inc. and Stand With Crypto, did not immediately comment.\n\nSacks did not immediately return an emailed request for comment.

That was the one opportunity in our view that was unreasonable to expect people to exit the mine, he said.\n\nAccording to Rutledge, government was provided with clear information on the underground conditions and those trapped in shaft 11 were unable to exit without assistance.\n\nMoving forward, he said the commission will also look at seeking constitutional damages as this action was a violation of rights.\n\nAccording to police, 246 illegal miners have been rescued from the North West mine.\n\nThe operation was undertaken by different specialists health-care professionals led by acting Deputy Director General for Hospitals and Clinical Support, Agisanang Portia Tlou, Chief Director for Hospitals and Clinical Support Services Zenzo Ndabula, and Chief Director for Dr. Kenneth Kaunda district, Phil Maboe.\n\nNational police spokesperson, Colonel Athlenda Mathe, said nine illegal miners had been taken for medical check-ups while the rest were taken in police custody.\n\nThe illegal miners are from; Mozambique, Lesotho, Zimbabwe with at least five being South African.\n\n",

It was common knowledge that fishing couldnt be done in the afternoon because fish would see the nets and wouldnt enter. This act of faith led to a miraculous catch.\n\nThe power of Gods word lies in its ability to transcend human understanding. Its not about conventional or scientific logic or reason; its about trusting in the One who speaks.\n\nAs Romans 1:17 says, The just shall live by faith. Faith is the language of Gods operation, and its the only way to please Him (Hebrews 11:6).\n\nJesus emphasizes the importance of faith in Mark 11:22-24. He tells His disciples to have faith in God and assures them that whatever they ask for in prayer, believing theyll receive it, will be theirs. This is not just a suggestion; its a command. Jesus wants us to trust Him completely, without questioning His ways.\n\nBut how do we develop this kind of faith? The answer lies in Gods word. As Psalm 119:160 says, The entirety of Your word is truth.\n\nWe must immerse ourselves in Scripture, allowing its truth to transform our minds and hearts. We must learn to trust Gods word, even when it seems foolish or contradictory to our scientific knowledge or circumstances.\n\nSo, lets approach Gods word with faith, not questioning its logic or reasonableness. Lets talk to Him through His word and prayer, trusting that He will guide us and bless us. Lets cast our nets deeper into the waters of Gods blessings, trusting in His word and His faithfulness.\n\nAs we close, remember that faith is not a feeling; its a choice. Choose to trust Gods word today, and watch Him work miracles in your life.\n\nPRAYER:\n\nDear Heavenly Father, we thank You for the power of Your word. Help us to trust in You, even when Your ways seem foolish to us. Give us the faith to take You at Your word, and may we experience the miraculous blessings that come from obeying Your instructions.\n\nMay Your word be our guide, our comfort, and our strength. In Jesus name, we pray.\n\nAMEN.\n\n",
