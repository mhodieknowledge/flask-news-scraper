The recent significant investments in our national road infrastructure, including the ongoing Bulawayo-Victoria Falls Road rehabilitation and upgrading project, are vital for economic growth, tourism and public safety, said the government.To protect this critical infrastructure and ensure its longevity, the ministry said there will be zero tolerance for overloaded vehicles.Going forward, any truck found to be overloaded on the Bulawayo Victoria Falls Road, or any other major highway, will be subject to severe penalties and fines as prescribed by the countrys laws. This enforcement is not limited to the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls corridor as it applies to all major highways across Zimbabwe to preserve the national road network.Overloading severely damages road surfaces, leading to premature potholes, structural failures, and increased public expenditure on repairs. It also poses a serious safety risk to all road users.We urge all transport operators and drivers to comply with stipulated axle limits. Regular checkpoints and weighbridges will be operational to ensure adherence, the ministry added.\n\nSpeaking at the official opening of the ninth Parliaments second session back in 2019, President Emmerson Mnangagwa revealed a whopping US$2,5 billion on road infrastructure projects, a figure which has definitely multiplied since the government has sustained the infrastructure projects.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, the MoTID said owing to the need to safeguard investments, stiffer penalties will be imposed going forward.This serves as a formal notice to all motorists and transport operators regarding the strict enforcement of axle load regulations on Zimbabwes major highways, with immediate effect.
