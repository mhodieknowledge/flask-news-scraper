            "content": "By BBC News\n\nA FORMER girlfriend of Sean Diddy Combs, testifying for a second day at his criminal trial under the pseudonym Jane, described how she felt pressured to engage in sexual encounters with male escorts while he watched, despite her expressing they upset her.\n\nShe also alleged a network of employees helped procure drugs for the lengthy encounters, known as hotel nights or freak-offs, that left her in pain and with frequent infections.Prosecutors have charged Mr Combs, 55, with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution.He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.At the beginning of the trial, now in its fifth week, defence attorney Teny Geragos said the government had overstepped with its charges and are trying to portray consensual sex between adults as evidence of crimes.With Janes testimony, prosecutors are seeking to provide evidence that the music moguls activities were criminal.In one hotel night encounter in New York in 2023, Jane testified that she invited a male sex worker to fly from Atlanta, Georgia, to New York City to join her and Mr Combs for an encounter at the Trump International Hotel.Jane paid for his ticket, she testified, and afterward, she worked to ensure that an envelope containing several thousand dollars was left for the escort at the front desk.On another occasion, the woman testified that Mr Combss chief of staff Kristina Khorram allegedly instructed her to pick up drugs from Los Angeles to bring to Mr Combs Miami mansion.Ms Khorram has been named by prosecutors in court as a co-conspirator to Mr Combs, and could potentially testify.Sean Diddy Combs: Who is the US rapper accused of sex trafficking?Jane told the court that she picked the package up from a member of Mr Combs security, put it in her check-in luggage and flew to Miami, where she discovered it contained ecstasy.She also said she often saw Mr Combs call his assistants and security to bring drugs to the hotels where they had their encounters with escorts.One of the charges Mr Combs faces is racketeering. In order to prove that, prosecutors have to show that he was running a criminal enterprise and conspiring to commit crimes.Jane testifies about a financial love contractBy the time of the 2023 New York encounter, Jane said she realised she no longer wanted to participate in these hotel nights. The pair had been together since 2021.During the trip, the two began bickering about them and she told Mr Combs she was done with this, she said.Mr Combs was defensive, she said, but told her they didnt have to continue. Still, later that night, she joined him for one.Prosecutors asked the woman several times why she stayed in a relationship with Mr Combs, even as she described feeling disgusted, repulsed after one rare encounter where she did not take drugs, which she said she took to make them seem less real.A federal prosecutor asked why she arranged the hotel night in New York if she had just told Mr Combs she no longer wanted to participate.Jane paused for a long time, at first saying it was hard to answer. She wanted to make her partner happy, she said.Prosecutors introduced the pairs financial ties. At the time, Mr Combs was paying Janes $10,000 per month rent, which he continues to do to this day.Jane testified that the pair made a love contract in which Mr Combs agreed to give her a monthly $10,000 allowance for two years. The rapper would hold the money over her head if she resisted hotel nights, she testified.She said one week, she was planning an all-star party with male escorts from their previous encounters.Mr Combs said he was hyped, but Jane eventually tried to back out. Prosecutors showed the jury texts between the two, where Jane sent photos to prove she was not feeling well.Mr Combs responded with messages she interpreted as threats to cut her off financially.In 2024, near the end of their relationship, Mr Combs told her that he had not known the hotel night encounters upset her and that she had not told him.But in reviewing her messages and notes from their relationship, Jane said she realised she expressed her unhappiness.In one exchange, she told Mr Combs she was upset that he had spent time with another woman after only engaging in a hotel night with her.I need a breather and a break from you, she texted him in November 2021.This doesnt make me feel good at all, your intentions are in plain sight.She also testified on Friday that the hotel nights took a physical toll on her.She told the court that she frequently contracted infections, and felt pelvic pain 100% of the time following the encounters.Jane recalled she probably did not tell Mr Combs about these physical issues because I just didnt want to indicate any negativity, she said.Earlier in the trial, R&B singer Cassandra Cassie Ventura took the witness stand, describing similar drug-fuelled sex encounters with Mr Combs, who she dated for more than a decade.She will continue to face questioning next week, with Mr Combs defence attorneys likely to be grilling her extensively about her time with the rap mogul.\n\nShe also alleged a network of employees helped procure drugs for the lengthy encounters, known as hotel nights or freak-offs, that left her in pain and with frequent infections.\n\nProsecutors have charged Mr Combs, 55, with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution.He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.At the beginning of the trial, now in its fifth week, defence attorney Teny Geragos said the government had overstepped with its charges and are trying to portray consensual sex between adults as evidence of crimes.With Janes testimony, prosecutors are seeking to provide evidence that the music moguls activities were criminal.In one hotel night encounter in New York in 2023, Jane testified that she invited a male sex worker to fly from Atlanta, Georgia, to New York City to join her and Mr Combs for an encounter at the Trump International Hotel.Jane paid for his ticket, she testified, and afterward, she worked to ensure that an envelope containing several thousand dollars was left for the escort at the front desk.On another occasion, the woman testified that Mr Combss chief of staff Kristina Khorram allegedly instructed her to pick up drugs from Los Angeles to bring to Mr Combs Miami mansion.Ms Khorram has been named by prosecutors in court as a co-conspirator to Mr Combs, and could potentially testify.Sean Diddy Combs: Who is the US rapper accused of sex trafficking?Jane told the court that she picked the package up from a member of Mr Combs security, put it in her check-in luggage and flew to Miami, where she discovered it contained ecstasy.She also said she often saw Mr Combs call his assistants and security to bring drugs to the hotels where they had their encounters with escorts.One of the charges Mr Combs faces is racketeering.

            "content": "By Franny Rabkin l TimesLive\n\nTHE Supreme Court of Appeal has rejected an appeal by the minister of Home Affairs against the Johannesburg High Court order on Zimbabwe Exemption Permits (ZEPs), which give about 180,000 Zimbabweans a special dispensation to lawfully remain in South Africa.\n\nThe judgment also clears the path for the Zimbabwean Immigration Federation to return to court and argue that it is only Parliament, and not the Home Affairs minister, which can decide whether to extend the ZEP regime.In 2023, the Johannesburg High Court set aside a decision by former minister Aaron Motsoaledi to terminate the ZEP regime and to reconsider his decision, following a fair process.The SCAs judgment on Friday said that counsel for the minister told the court that the order is being implemented, and  the minister is following a fair process.But the federation wants to go back to court to argue that ZEP holders and their children enjoy constitutional rights in South Africa. If these are to be limited, only Parliament may do so  by enacting a law of general application, says the SCAs judgment.The SCA did not give a view on whether that argument was correct, but it rejected an appeal by the minister that would have prevented the federation from ever making it.When the High Court gave its order, the federation was one of the parties in the litigation, along with the Helen Suzman Foundation (HSF). Theirs were two separate cases, which were heard together.While the federation and the HSF both wanted similar orders, at that time, from the High Court, their grounds were different. And while the HSF asked the court for a final order, the federation only sought an interim interdict  it wanted to argue its main case at a later date. The court gave a final order, as sought by the HSF, and also the interim interdict sought by the federation.The minister had already tried, and failed, to appeal against the HSF order.In this case, the minister approached the SCA on appeal, saying the interim interdict was redundant since the court had already granted a final order to the HSF.In Fridays judgment, the SCA disagreed.

in Morocco Friday evening.\n\nZimbabwes senior mens soccer side struggled to keep position in the first few minutes of the game hence helping Burkina Faso to create several chances.Les Etalons managed to score its first goal of the match in the 23rd minute, thanks to Wydad AC midfieder Stephane Aziz Ki, who fired in a far post shot which Zimbabwe goalkeeper Washington Arubi failed to stop.Eager to respond, the Warriors quickly re-organised and created a clear chance, which saw them winning a free kick on the edge of the box after Burkina Faso broke a promising attack by fouling Tawanda Maswanhise.Despite getting the half chance, Zimbabwes effort from the free kick was a disapointment as it was nowhere near a goal.The Warriors were then quickly punished in the 29th minute by Cyrique Irie,.who gave Burkina Faso a comfortable 2-0 lead.Having gone to the break trailing 2-0 Warriors coach Michael Nees made tactical changes in the 63rd minute as he brought in a trio of Tawanda Macheke, Sean Fusire and Daniel Msendami,.who came in for Khama Billiat, Mason Mushore and Maswanhise.However, this did not pay off as Burkina Faso remained resolute at the back hence they got a 2-0
