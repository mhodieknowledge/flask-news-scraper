            "content": "By Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThis story was originally published byGlobal Press Journal\n\nLand reforms gave Zimbabweans farms  but contract tobacco deals have handed power to private companies.\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  Zimbabwes tobacco sector was once on the brink of collapse. Now, its booming again. Last year alone, it earned the country close to US$1 billion in revenue.\n\nBut though the crop is one of the countrys top exports and production has soared, small-scale contract farmers say they see little profit due to restrictive financing agreements.\n\nThe tobacco boom, farmers say, is keeping them in debt.\n\nGift Ngoma is among them. When he lost his clerk job eight years ago, tobacco farming was the only way he could feed his family. But fertilizer, seeds and labor proved expensive. Even money from the few cows he sold wasnt enough.\n\nLike many rural Zimbabweans, hed gotten land  about 3.5 hectares (9 acres)  through traditional tenure. But those who secured land that way often lack a title deed. For Ngoma, formal credit was out of the question.\n\nNgoma knew of local farmers who had entered agreements with private companies. The deals looked good at first: Each planting season, a company provided farmers with seeds and fertilizer on credit. Theyd offer technical support throughout the season. In return, farmers sold enough of their crop to the company and used part of the revenue to cover what they owed.\n\nNgoma signed on with Premium Leaf Zimbabwe, a subsidiary of Premium Tobacco  a global company headquartered in Dubai.\n\nThe company provided him with seeds and some money for labor. Once harvest came, he sold enough tobacco to the company to pay off his debt. But over time, he says, this agreement came to feel like a trap. The seeds and other inputs are overpriced, he says, and theres little money left over to find true success as a farmer.\n\nGift Ngoma, a tobacco farmer, waits to sell his crop in Harare. He turned to farming after losing his formal job, but he says contract agreements have trapped him in debt. He now advocates for land rights and alternative financing.

The industry brings in hundreds of millions of United States dollars each year and contributes nearly 10% of Zimbabwes gross domestic product. It accounts for 30% of all exports and over 50% of agricultural exports. In 2024, Zimbabwe was the worlds third-largest exporter of raw tobacco, accounting for 10% of global exports, behind Brazil and India.\n\nSources: International Trade Centre; Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency; UN COMTRADE\n\nBut smallholding farmers dont feel that success. In December 2024, the government announced plans to issue title deeds to beneficiaries of the land reform program, which would give farmers a chance to use their land as collateral and rely less on contract farming. But for now, many still rely on tobacco contracts.\n\nWe are in a cycle of oppression, Ngoma says. There is poverty in contract farming. Its as if we are laborers on our farms.\n\nWhen Global Press Journal reached out to Premium Leaf Zimbabwe for comment, they said it was the companys policy to protect the privacy of our farmers and operational integrity. Tian Ze and British American Tobacco did not respond to several requests for comment.\n\nTobacco farmers Chamu Rukwere and Rudo Nedziwe grade their harvest at home in Rusape, Zimbabwe. While contract farming connects them to global markets, they say it strips away the autonomy land reform was meant to provide.

The majority black population was confined to degraded, overcrowded communal areas.\n\nIn 2000, then-President Robert Mugabe launched the controversial Fast Track Land Reform Programme. The government redistributed millions of hectares of land from about 6,000 large, white-owned farms to more than 168,000 black-owned farms, according to a Human Rights Watch report.\n\nThe reforms were rushed, controversial and violent, but they brought a new agrarian structure. Tobacco, at the time one of the most valuable crops and dominated by white-owned farms, shifted to small-scale operations by the new landowners.\n\nBut the new generation of farmers didnt have access to traditional bank credit since they didnt hold deeds to their land. Tobacco production dropped dramatically, from over 197,000 tons in 1998 to about 44,000 tons in 2006.\n\nSource: Food and Agriculture Organization; The Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development; Tobacco Industry & Marketing Board Election Commission of India, New Delhi\n\nFarmers needed support, and into the vacuum stepped contract schemes, mostly by Chinese agribusinesses such as Tian Ze. They supplied seeds, fertilizers and technical support in exchange for crop guarantees, price control and access to global markets. Ultimately, those contracts played a key role in the post-reform tobacco boom.\n\nContract schemes now dominate Zimbabwes tobacco farming, says Emmanuel Matsvaire, acting chief executive officer of the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board. In the 2024-25 season alone, the board recorded a total of 106,555 small-scale growers, he says, and about 89% of these are contract farming. In the 2025 season, the board licensed 43 companies to contract tobacco farmers.\n\nThe countrys economy has long struggled and local financing is generally limited, Matsvaire says. These companies fill the gap.\n\nBut farmers say the fine print works against them.\n\nSeeds and fertilizer are overpriced, Ngoma says. For half a hectare, he receives seven bags of fertilizer for US$65 each. At the shops, the same bag costs about US$40. Many farmers dont have ready cash to buy directly from shops, so they rely on private companies to provide fertilizer and other inputs, even if it means paying more when harvest comes.\n\nPiles of tobacco await processing in Rusape, Zimbabwe. Though tobacco is one of the countrys top exports and production has soared, small-scale contract farmers say that thanks to restrictive agreements, they see little profit. Photo credit: Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nBecause of poverty, we continue to be dependent, Ngoma says.\n\nOnce contract farmers pay back the debts, very little is left. In some cases, the total earnings dont even cover the debt, Ngoma says, which forces them to grow tobacco for the same company the next season.\n\nThe companies control the whole process, including land use, Ngoma says, adding that at times they bring in agricultural experts who dictate seed types, planting times and farming methods, completely disregarding local farming knowledge.\n\nPeter Neshumba, 36, began contract farming for Premium Leaf Zimbabwe in 2024. He says these companies go as far as controlling whether farmers can plant anything else. They want full devotion for their crops, he says. Until harvest, the land essentially belongs to them.\n\nIf a farmer doesnt stick to the rules, the company might refuse to buy their crop or leave them without a contract the next season, he says.\n\nA contract analyzed in a 2023 study in Oikos, a journal published by Zimbabwe Ezekiel Guti University, shows just how tobacco contracts lock small-scale farmers into risky debt. The 2019-20 Tian Ze contract required farmers to repay loans before seeing any profit, even requiring some to put their property on the line as collateral.\n\nThese arrangements undermine Zimbabwes land reforms, says George Seremwe, the president of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Growers Association. The reforms were meant to redress colonial imbalances, but contract farming introduces new vulnerabilities for small-scale farmers as they cede control of their land to contracting companies.\n\nBut Nelson Marongwe, an independent land expert who has researched tobacco farming and land rights, doesnt think so. The contracts are valid, he says, and address a production gap.\n\nBut it needs to be for a limited period, he says, as there is a risk of farmers losing autonomy and companies abusing their bargaining power.\n\nTobacco farmer Peter Neshumba waits for payment after selling his crop to Premium Leaf Zimbabwe in Harare. He says contract farming controls nearly every aspect of production, leaving farmers with little say over their land until harvest. Photo credit: Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThe tobacco board is trying to make these arrangements fairer to farmers, Matsvaire says. The government is implementing a framework to ensure farmers receive a fair share of profits, receive inputs in time and arent burdened with overpriced or substandard inputs. The framework will also set a minimum input package for farmers.\n\nMatsvaire adds that this farming season, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe has mandated that tobacco farmers retain 70% of their earnings, in US dollars to protect them from exchange-rate losses.\n\nBut Ngoma says other issues, like land control and alternative financing methods, still need to be addressed.\n\nOne solution, Marongwe, the land expert, says, is to secure rural land rights for all farmers, which would expand access to other financing options.\n\nSeremwe says farmers need fairer terms, but the solution is not to abandon contract farming, since the country needs the foreign investment.\n\nDespite the challenges, Neshumba plans to keep contract farming. He doesnt have financing alternatives. When he started, he hoped for better returns. Now that Im in it, he says, I feel used.\n\nFor farmers like Ngoma, the goal is self-financing.\n\nContract farming, he says, is a bondage.\n\nLinda Mujuruis a Reporter-in-Residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.

            "content": "BBC\n\nThe people of Malawi are set to vote for their next leader, following a turbulent five years involving economic turmoil, natural disasters and the shock death of the nations vice-president.\n\nCurrent President Lazarus Chakwera is vying for a second term, his main rival being Peter Mutharika, an octogenarian who has also held office in the southern African nation once before.\n\nTransparency and fairness are key talking points ahead of the vote, given that the result of Malawis 2019 presidential election was overturned in the courts due to widespread irregularities.\n\nPolling day is Tuesday 16 September 2025.\n\nThe 7.2 million registered voters will be taking part in three elections:\n\nAFP/Getty Images Lazarus Chakwera (L) and Peter Mutharika (R) have faced each other at the ballot before\n\nAmong the 17 hopefuls there are two clear front-runners.\n\nChakwera and Mutharika will square off against each other at the polls for the fourth time  though the third time ended up not counting.\n\nMutharika first defeated Chakwera in 2014, but when he was declared winner over Chakwera in the next election in 2019 the result was annulled. Chakwera won the re-run the following year.\n\nLazarus Chakwera  Malawi Congress Party (MCP)\n\nChakwera, a former theology lecturer and preacher, had no political experience when he emerged as leader of the MCP in 2013.\n\nWhen he ran for president in 2014 he was unsuccessful, but in 2020 he triumphed,beating the incumbent, Mutharika, in that unprecedented re-run.\n\nChakweras time in office has been marred by economic turmoil and allegations of corruption. The 70-year-old did, however, reintroduce train services in Malawi for the first time in over three decades. He has also overseen major road construction across the country.\n\nPeter Mutharika  Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)\n\nMutharika, an 85-year-old former lawyer and law lecturer, led Malawi from 2014 to 2020.\n\nHe is the brother of the late President Bingu wa Mutharika, who died in office in 2012.\n\nLike Chakwera, Mutharika is also burdened by corruption allegations and links to economic crises. However, his supporters would argue that the current high inflation rate (around 27%) is proof that Mutharika managed the economy better than his successor.\n\nMutharikas age may count against him this election  speculation about his health is rife, especially as he has rarely been seen out in public during the campaign period.\n\nOther contenders garnering attention are former presidentJoyce Banda(Peoples Party), current Vice-PresidentMichael Usi(Odya Zake Alibe Mlandu)and former reserve bank governorDalitso Kabambe(UTM).\n\nThe economy\n\nMalawi has long been one of the poorest countries in the world, butthe past few years have been especially punishing.\n\nThe country wasdevastated by Cyclone Freddythat killed hundreds of people in 2023, then a drought swept across southern Africa the following year. Food prices skyrocketed due to a short supply of crops, pushing many Malawians into extreme poverty.\n\nEconomists also put Malawis current inflation problems partly down to the shortage of foreign currencies  known as forex  in the banks.\n\nIn addition, Malawi has beenforced to devalue its currencyand was recently crippled by fuel shortages and nationwide power outages.\n\nCorruption\n\nWhen Chakwera came to power, he vowed to to clear the rubble of corruption that has long plagued Malawian politics. His administration says it has excelled in this area, but critics  including the influential Catholic Church  say this is not the case.\n\nScepticism was sparked last year when the director of public prosecutions dropped corruption charges against high-profile figures.\n\nAdditionally, Malawis anti-graft agency, the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB), has been without a director since former boss Martha Chizuma left more than a year ago.\n\nTo some, the failure to appoint a new head actively hinders the fight against corruption.\n\nBut previous administrations have also been dogged by graft allegations. For instance, the ACBaccused Mutharika of receiving a kickback from a contractto supply food to the police  he denied any wrongdoing.\n\nBandas reputation was dented by a scandal dubbed cashgate which happened under her watch. She was cleared by the ACB of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe former vice-presidents death\n\nIn June last year, Vice-PresidentSaulos Chilima died in a plane crash. Popular with the youth, Chilima led the UTM party and could have been a key contender in the upcoming elections, especially as he had fallen out with the president.\n\nAlthough two investigations  one carried out by Germanys aviation accidents agency and another by a Malawi government-appointed commission  did not find evidence of foul play, some Malawians remain suspicious of the authorities.\n\nOpposition parties have been fuelling this scepticism during their campaigns, referring to Chakweras party as the Chikangawa Party (Chikangawa Forest being the site of the plane crash).\n\nAFP/Getty Images Hundreds in Malawi lost their lives to Cyclone Freddy\n\nMalawi was governed by the MCP from its independence in 1964 until the countrys first multi-party poll in 1994.\n\nSince the shift from a one-party state, the United Democratic Front, the DPP, the Peoples Party and the MCP have all enjoyed stints in power.\n\nChakweras victory with the MCP in 2020 was one of the most significant moments in the countrys political history.\n\nA general election had taken place the year before and Mutharika was declared the winner.\n\nHowever,the Constitutional Court annulled the election, saying there had been widespread tampering, including the use of Tipp-Ex correction fluid on results sheets.\n\nJudges ordered a re-run for 2020, and Chakwera won with 59% of the vote after having teamed up with Chilima.\n\nAlthough Mutharika branded the re-run unacceptable, the Constitutional Court gained international acclaim for safeguarding democracy and refusing to be influenced by presidential power.\n\nFollowing the controversy of the 2019 election, Malawi implemented a new system, where a candidate must gain more than 50% of the total votes to win the presidency in the first round.\n\nThere is a strong possibility that this years candidates will not reach this threshold in the initial poll, meaning a run-off election will have to be held.\n\nThe MCP and DPP will likely try to bring other, smaller parties on board in order to secure a majority in the second time round.\n\nThe courts actions following the 2019 vote have given some Malawians faith in the electoral process.\n\nHowever, over the past months, a number or civil society organisations and opposition parties have accused the electoral commission of favouring the MCP, alleging that its top management has links to the governing party. The commission has firmly denied being biased.\n\nA protest in June calling for the resignation of the commissions top officials was attacked by masked, machete-wielding men, leading to concerns about freedom of expression in the run-up to the election.\n\nThe assault was not an isolated incident  there have been numerous reports of politically motivated violence ahead of the general election.\n\nThe outcome of the presidential election will be announced by the end of 24 September.\n\nThe parliamentary results will be announced by the end of 30 September.\n\n",
