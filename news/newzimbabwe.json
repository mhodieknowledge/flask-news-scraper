Between January and July 2015, one of Mwanandimais bank accounts received nearly R679,000.\n\nLopdale Services and Investments was paid R14.65 million in the period between August 2015 to December 2019, while an additional R396,100 was also transferred.\n\nMwanandimai set up supplier accounts resembling existing ones, directing payments to accounts linked to himself and created a fake employee, who as part of ETUs Discovery Medical Aid Scheme, led to fraudulent contributions totalling R160,845 from September 2017 to April 2020.\n\nETU also paid R239,819 for his medical aid contributions to Bestmed from November 2016 to April 2020, without deducting these amounts from his salary.\n\nETU also covered his cellular phone accounts, with no recovery from his salary and he set up three debit orders on the entitys account.\n\nMwanandimai manipulated bank master data and payroll records to gain unauthorised benefits.\n\nHe initially had viewing rights on the banking system but was subsequently granted payment loading access after he requested further authorisation, according to court papers.\n\nMwanandimais actions were discovered after a new accountant was hired and audited the accounts, and established that he misappropriated over R17m, with about R6.8m, the capital debt, confirmed.\n\nIn September 2020, he acknowledged the use of funds from ETU and confirmed that the amount owed corresponds to the outstanding balance specified in the signed acknowledgment of debt.\n\nThe debtor (Mwanandimai) is truly and lawfully indebted and legally bound to the creditor (ETU) in the amount of six million seven hundred and ninety-seven thousand seven hundred and fifteen rand and sixty cents (R6 797 715.60), reads the acknowledgment of debt.\n\nIn the acknowledgment of debt, he admitted that he stole several millions of rand from ETU and that the total amount stolen was in excess of the capital debt. He did repay certain of the money which he stole.\n\nHis lawyers indicated that he was willing to settle the amount outstanding of R1.777m but could only afford an amount of R100,000 a month due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the July 2021 looting unrest, which has affected his business.\n\nIn a letter dated October 11, 2021, Mwanandimai offered to pay over R10.9m, starting January 31, 2022, over a period of 72 months, which is less than the outstanding balance of R17.1m.\n\nA certificate of balance indicating an amount of R17.1m was issued after all transactions were confirmed by the relevant banks, but Mwanandimai has not made any payments since June 2021.\n\nLast Thursday, Acting Judge Sanet van Aswegen found that Mwanandimai did not manage or disclose his estate with sufficient transparency, and that supporting documentation was provided only at the hearing, despite the prior submission of both an answering affidavit and a supplementary answering affidavit.\n\nIn my considered opinion, the interests of justice are best served by the court exercising its discretion to grant a final sequestration order.\n\nThe issuance of such an order would benefit all the creditors by invoking the pertinent provisions of the Insolvency Act, thereby facilitating an investigation of the estate for their advantage, the acting judge declared.\n\nETU also filed a fraud case with the Yeoville police station in September 2020.\n\nMwanandimais legal representative did not respond to requests for comment while attempts to contact ETU were unsuccessful.\n\n",

            "content": "FAO\n\nAt the 13th Annual National Agribusiness Conference, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) re-affirmed its role as a key technical partner in building resilient, market-driven horticultural value chains, supporting Zimbabwes Vision 2030 through infrastructure development, standards compliance, and climate-smart agriculture.\n\nThe conference held during the Zimbabwe Agricultural Show, convened senior government officials, agribusiness leaders, development partners, and farmers under the themeBuilding Resilient and Market-Driven Horticultural Value Chains.\n\nRepresenting the United Nations in Zimbabwe, FAO Subregional Coordinator for Southern Africa and Representative to Zimbabwe, Patrice Talla delivered remarks on behalf of UN Resident and Humanitarian Coordinator Edward Kallon, emphasizing the alignment of the conferences objectives with the Zimbabwe UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework.\n\nThe UN Cooperation Framework is our collective blueprint for supporting Zimbabwes development aspirations. Building resilient and market-driven horticultural value chains is not just an agricultural goal, it is a pathway to inclusive economic growth, food security, and climate resilience, said Mr. Edward Kallon.\n\nWe commend the Government of Zimbabwe for its leadership and re-affirm the UNs commitment. Our support to the Government and people of Zimbabwe will continue to be guided by the current Zimbabwe UN Cooperation Framework (2022-2026) aligned with the NDS-I, and in the next Cooperation Framework, whose roadmap is in progress for 2027-2030 to complement NDS-II. Working hand-in-hand with national stakeholders, we shall deliver for Zimbabwe on Vision 2030 to become upper middle-income society and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, added Mr. Kallon.\n\nHorticulture is emerging as a cornerstone of Zimbabwes export strategy, contributing over USD 120 million annually through high-value crops such as blueberries, citrus, macadamia, and cut flowers. With the government targeting a USD 2.5 billion horticulture industry by 2030, the sector is poised for rapid expansion. Stakeholders attending the ANAC acknowledged that unlocking this potential requires strategic partnerships, coordinated investment, compliance with international standards and access to finance complemented by robust market intelligence.\n\nFAOs interventions in Zimbabwe are directly addressing these needs by playing a central role in shaping resilient and market-responsive value chains. Through strategic investments in infrastructure, food safety, digital extension, and climate-smart practices, FAO is supporting producers to meet global standards and unlock export potential. FAOs commitment to inclusive financing and good agricultural practices underscores its leadership in transforming horticulture into a driver of sustainable growth and rural empowerment. FAO has also facilitated the establishment of a USD 6.2 million Seed Revolving Fund managed by AFC Land and Development Bank funded by the African Development Bank.\n\nFAO is proud to be the lead technical agency supporting agrifood systems transformation in Zimbabwe. FAOs mandate is rooted in empowering producers, especially women and youth, with the tools and knowledge to thrive in competitive markets. Through strategic partnerships and innovation, we are helping Zimbabwe build a horticulture sector that is resilient, inclusive, and globally recognized, said Talla.\n\nThe conference highlighted the importance of regional integration, with the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) offering new opportunities for intra-African trade. FAOs upgrading of human health laboratories is enhancing pest and disease surveillance and food safety testing, critical components for accessing regional and international markets.\n\nAllow me to reaffirm Governments unwavering commitment to the agricultural sector. Together we are turning challenges into opportunities, policies into action, aspirations into reality. May this conference inspire new partnerships, practical solutions, and bold investments that will sustain Zimbabwes agricultural renaissance, said Honourable Vice President of Zimbabwe, Dr. CGDN Chiwenga in a keynote address read on his behalf by the Minister of Defence, Honourable Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri.\n\nThe 13th ANAC concluded with a call for bold leadership, coordinated action, and sustained partnerships. FAO reaffirmed its commitment to walking alongside Zimbabwe on its journey toward a resilient, market-driven horticulture industry that uplifts rural livelihoods and strengthening the national agriculture economy.\n\n",

            "content": "Jamaicans.com\n\nOn April 17, 1980, reggae icon Bob Marley stepped onto the stage at Rufaro Stadium in Harare to perform at Zimbabwes independence celebration. His songZimbabwerang through the air as a newly free nation celebrated the end of colonial rule. But the story behind the song goes deepershaped by Marleys connection to Africa, the liberation struggle, and a few musical friends in Ethiopia.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Marley frequently visited Ethiopia, drawn by his Rastafarian beliefs and support for African unity. During one visit toAddis Ababa, he was introduced to a group of African musicians working for the United Nations. One of them was a Zimbabwean jazz musician and poet who had formed a band calledThe United Nations Jazz Band. They werent reggae artists, but Marley took interest in their talent and their roots.\n\nThe band and Marley developed a musical friendship. Though coming from different genres, they began to experiment with blending Marleys reggae style with traditional African rhythms. One day, Marley shared that he had been working on a song about Zimbabwes independence. He believed freedom for the country was near and wanted to create something special to support that moment.\n\nThe musicians helped shape the song, bringing in African influencesespecially Shona soundsand Marley welcomed their input. The result wasZimbabwe, a track filled with powerful lyrics like,Every man got a right to decide his own destiny.It was included in Marleys 1979 albumSurvival, which carried strong messages of resistance and African liberation.\n\nWhen Zimbabwes independence was officially declared in April 1980, Marley was invited to perform at the celebration. The new government couldnt afford to pay him, but Marley didnt hesitate. He paid for everything himself, including flying in his band and sound equipment fromLondon.\n\nThat night at Rufaro Stadium, 40,000 people gathered, including world leaders like Prince Charles and Indira Gandhi. As Marley performedZimbabwe, thousands more tried to enter the stadium, and police used tear gas to control the crowd. Still, Marley stayed on stage and kept singing. His commitment to the people never wavered. To make up for those who couldnt see the first concert, he performed again the following nightthis time for over 100,000 people.\n\nMarleys presence meant more than entertainment. He stood with Zimbabwe at a turning point in its history. His performance wasnt just a showit was a statement of unity, freedom, and African pride. His song had become the unofficial anthem of Zimbabwes struggle and victory.\n\nEven after Marleys death in 1981,Zimbabweremains one of his most powerful and politically significant songs. It symbolizes not only a nations independence but also the power of music to inspire and unite people across borders.\n\nFor Zimbabweans, Marleys gift was unforgettablea reggae anthem that echoed their journey, struggles, and hope for the future.\n\n",
