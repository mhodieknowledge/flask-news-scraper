            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTEN people, including senior citizens aged over 70, appeared in court Saturday accused of attempting to participate in an unsanctioned demonstration dubbed the One Million Man March against President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nThe accused are Rose Chirenje (65) of Sandton, Westgate; Nyarai Chigudu (52) of Glen View 3; Kenesia Jera (62) of Whitecliff; Edward Mandikutse (69) of Sunningdale 3; Dexter Jena (69) of Muredzo Farm, Wedza; and Hazvinei Machingura (69) of Makomo Extension, Epworth.Others are Stephen Chagwiza (48) of Eastview; Jacob Masaraure (75) of Lodia Farm, Chivhu; Mapengo Mapengo (57) of Chizhanda Township, Mutoko; and Joephrey Chigwerewe (70) of Huyuyu, Mutoko.The group appeared before Harare magistrate Caroline Kuhudzayi charged with participating in a gathering with intent to promote public violence, breaches of peace or bigotry in violation of Section 37(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act [Chapter 9:23].Prosecutors allege that on October 17, 2025, the accused, acting on calls by political activist Blessed Runesu Geza, gathered near Africa Unity Square in Harare intending to take part in the planned One Million Man March against Mnangagwas government.According to the State, Geza had earlier urged citizens through Facebook and WhatsApp to demonstrate against the President, accusing him of betraying the people of Zimbabwe and aligning himself with economic saboteurs,. derogatorily referred to as Zviganandas.Police said the group was intercepted at the corner of George Silundika Avenue and Sam Nujoma Street, where they were allegedly singing and dancing to a protest song with the lyrics Zvigananda chera mwena nguva yakwana, chera mwena zvigananda  loosely translated as Economic saboteurs, your time is up.Detectives from CID Law and Order Harare arrested the first six suspects at the scene and later apprehended four others, Chagwiza, Masaraure, Mapengo and Chigwerewe, who were allegedly found hiding in a silver Toyota Probox (AGG 1898) parked at Corner Sixth Street and Kwame Nkrumah Avenue.Investigators claim that stones, boulders and other missiles were found hidden near the protest site.In his sworn affidavit opposing bail, Detective Sergeant Lovemore Chisi of CID Law and Order argued that releasing the accused could threaten national peace and security.The nature of the offence suggests a propensity for inciting or engaging in further public disorder, he said.Releasing the accused could reignite unrest or embolden others.Chisi also warned that the accused might abscond trial given the lengthy custodial sentence they face if convicted.The group was remanded in custody to Monday for their bail application hearing.Police said investigations were ongoing and that several other suspects linked to the planned march remain at large.\n\nThe accused are Rose Chirenje (65) of Sandton, Westgate; Nyarai Chigudu (52) of Glen View 3; Kenesia Jera (62)

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE newly elected Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) secretary general, Tirivanhu Marimo has called on the countrys working class to urgently strategise and build a strong front in the wake of deepening poverty.\n\nThe clarion call comes at a time when salaries have been at their record lowest with most mid-level professionals taking home an average of US$300 per month, which is way below the practical cost of living.Also, protection of workers has massively deteriorated as many now forgo their rights for fear of losing their jobs.Speaking at a labour forum co-hosted by the Labour Economics and Development Research Institute of Zimbabwe (LEDRIZ) and the Friedrich Erbert Stiftung (FES), Marimo said the time has come for labour unions to join hands and fight against rising worker poverty.We may wear different jackets, but the pain of poverty and exploitation is the same. Our divisions only serve those who benefit from a weakened working class. We must reclaim the spirit of unity that once made labour the heartbeat of this nation. Because when workers speak with one voice, governments listen, employers tremble, and society begins to shift, said Marimo.He said the truth is that workers in Zimbabwe are under siege and reeling under the pressures of eroded wages, broken social protection which has rendered collective bargaining a ritual without any power.The labour leader bemoaned the huge toll of informality on decent work on the back of the rising debt stock, which he said is further worsened by the huge inequality gap. He said despite pensioners having contributed their all in nation building, they continue to be paid peanuts.If the TNF is to mean anything, it must be a platform of equality, not a rubber stamp for anti-worker policies. If the Public Service Bill is to pass, it must protectnot silencethe voice of public servants. And if the informal economy is to grow, it must do so with rights, with dignity, and with recognition, he added.\n\nThe clarion call comes at a time when salaries have been at their record lowest with most mid-level professionals taking home an average of US$300 per month, which is way below the practical cost of living.\n\nAlso, protection of workers has massively deteriorated as many now forgo their rights for fear of losing their jobs.Speaking at a labour forum co-hosted by the Labour Economics and Development Research Institute of Zimbabwe (LEDRIZ) and the Friedrich Erbert Stiftung (FES), Marimo said the time has come for labour unions to join hands and fight against rising worker poverty.We may wear different jackets, but the pain of poverty and exploitation is the same.

            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nVICE President Constantino Chiwenga has said Zimbabwes wealth should benefit all Zimbabweans and not just a few privileged individuals.\n\nThe ruling Zanu PF party second-in-charges remarks come days after the leaking of his explosive dossier wherein he demanded the immediate arrest of a number of the countrys super rich businessmen.\n\nChiwenga, who was speaking at the ongoing Zanu PF Annual Peoples Conference in Mutare, urged attendees not to forget why they went to war and that there were colleagues who sacrificed their lives for every Zimbabwean to benefit.\n\nOur theme captured the central task before us, that is to build a people centred economy that empowers every Zimbabwean and ensures that our national wealth benefits all and not just a privileged few. Economic empowerment must be genuine, said Chiwenga as he introduced President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nWe must always remember that we are not the alpha and omega of Zimbabwes journey, ours is to carry forward the torch passed to us by those who gave everything without expectation of reward, he further warned.\n\nChiwenga is in a tight and tense race against businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei to replace Mnangagwa in 2028 although there are concerted efforts to illegally extend the 83-year-old Zanu PF leaders term in office to 2030.\n\nHaving described Tagwirei, shadowy character Wicknell Chivayo and some of their associates as Zvigananda, a colloquial Zimbabwean term that means criminals, Chiwenga reportedly dropped a dossier last month detailing how billions of US dollars were being siphoned by the monied clique.\n\nThat was to be later dismissed in this weeks Politburo where Mnangagwa stood his ground and defended Tagwirei, who has been identified as the preferred successor be it in 2028 or 2030.\n\nChiwenga, who sensationally revealed that late liberation war hero General Josiah Tongogara knew that he would not see an independent Zimbabwe, said the much talked about 2030 Agenda must be understood as their duty for future generations rather than their own.\n\nHe added: Some of them like our late commander General Josiah Magama Tongogara knew they would not see a liberated Zimbabwe. He was told openly when the day comes that this country is going to be free, you will die, but he still fought until the last day.\n\nThey fought for the future, not for themselves, Vision 2030 therefore must be understood in the same light. It is about a Zimbabwe we will bequeath to generations to come.\n\nFactional fights within Zanu PF have now pitted Mnangagwa against Chiwenga in a clear repeat of what transpired between the former and his predecessor Robert Mugabe before the 2017 coup.\n\nQuestions about whether Chiwenga still wields influence within the military, an arm that was instrumental in toppling Mugabe, while Tagwireis financial muscle has proven enough a threat for him.\n\nEven staunch critics such as Christopher Mutsvangwa, who for a time reportedly dreamt of taking over from Mnangagwa, are now strongly behind the Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) elder, Tagwirei.\n\n",
