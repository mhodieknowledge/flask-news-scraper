It is shocking that after the speaker had been served with the court papers, he went on to make the arrangement.\n\nAs a party, we are operating in a normal democracy where the rule of law is respected when we have such a situation, we approach the courts, said Madzimure.\n\nCCC has been fragmented following Tshabangus reign of terror in the opposition in which he recalled elected officials resulting in then leader Nelson Chamisa dumping the opposition party.\n\nAfter the announcement in Parliament, CCC legislator Darlington Chigumbu registered his displeasureover the changes.\n\nI feel that as a Member of Parliament from this side, my rights are being infringed upon. I feel that what is happening in Parliament is not acceptable, said Chigumbu.\n\n",

Following the scrapping of the Zimbabwe dollar and the introduction of the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency in April, Tangandas valuation dropped to US$21.67 million, marking a loss of approximately US$112.62 million in market value since its ZSE listing.\n\nBut in a major climb down this week, Tanganda informed its shareholders that the decision for a full-scale migration will no longer be the case.\n\nReference is made to the Cautionary Announcements published on 28 October 2024 and 18 November 2024 regarding the proposed migration of Tanganda listing from the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) to the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange (VFEX) and the subsequent capital raise by way of a Renouncable Rights Offer to raise approximately US$7,7 million.\n\nThe Directors no longer recommend the migration of Tangandas listing to VFEX. Instead, they propose the creation of a class of shares to be known as Class A ordinary shares, which will be subsequently listed on the VFEX as a Secondary listing, the company said.\n\nThe company said a capital raise by way of a Renounceable Rights Offer to raise US$8 million will follow soon after the issuing, listing and allotment of Class A ordinary shares to the existing ordinary shareholders in proportion to their shareholding in the company.\n\nTanganda believes such initiatives are intended to enhance the companys capital structure, diversify shareholder offerings and ensure liquidity of the companys shares.\n\nFurther details regarding the transactions will be provided in a Circular to shareholders that is being finalized.\n\nThe transactions, if successful, may have a material effect on the Companys share price. Accordingly, shareholders are advised to exercise caution when dealing in the Companys shares, the company added.\n\n",

Indeed, we are currently spending much more money than what Harare spends cleaning our polluted water, he said.\n\nHe said in the recent past, the local authority once roped in officials from the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) and the Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) to stop mining activities along Mazowe River in an operation which worked briefly before it resurfaced again.\n\nThe local authority has since tabled plans to draw water from Masembura Dam using a pipeline which runs straight to the Bindura Waterworks. The plans were arranged about two years ago and we are now awaiting government approvals, he said.\n\nThe project is set to establisha 25-kilometre water pipeline from Masembura Dam to the capital of Mashonaland Central Province.\n\nThe government and Freda Rebecca Mine are part and parcel of the tripartite arrangement. The collaboration, which involves the government, will lead to the construction of a self-contained smart city at Bharasi Farm, about 10 kilometres from the Central Business District.\n\nRecords also show that obsolete equipment has dogged the Towns efforts to maintain a steady water supply over the years.\n\n",

Just like we did before Globe & Phoenix Primary collapsed, we are calling upon law enforcement agents to intervene and #SaveDalnyPrimary from collapse, said ARTUZ led by Obert Masaraure.\n\nIllegal artisanal mining is leaving a trail of ecological and infrastructure destruction in the said community. We are worried that when schools open in January 2025, Dalny Primary will be no more\n\nDalny 2 Primary has an enrollment of over 600 learners attended to by 22 patriotic teachers. If Dalny Primary School collapses when schools are open these lives can potentially be lost.\n\nThe closest school to Dalny Primary is Dalny 1 Primary which already accommodates 1 500 learners. There is no room for the 600 learners from Dalny 2. If Dalny Mine 2 Primary School is allowed to collapse 600 learners will be out of school, ARTUZ further said.\n\nThe teachers body said Zimbabwe already has a shortage of over 3,000 schools, and cannot afford to lose a great facility such as Dalny Primary School.\n\nIn 2023, Dalny Mine 2 had a Grade 7 pass rate of 26.8% which marginally improved to 26.9% in 2024. With all the challenges confronting education in Zimbabwe, the school is doing their best.\n\nARTUZ said the right to education for 600 learners can be secured while the right to a safe working environment for teachers can also be guaranteed and safety for the whole school ecosystem promoted.\n\nWhen NewZimbabwe.com contacted the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education communications director, Taungana Ndoro, said inter-ministerial efforts were being implemented to fix the matter.\n\nWe are aware of the matter and are working together through a whole of government approach involving the Ministry of Mines, Local Government, Environment, Provincial Affairs and Devolution to find a lasting solution that will ensure that we continue to provide quality education in a safe learning environment, Ndoro told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\n",
