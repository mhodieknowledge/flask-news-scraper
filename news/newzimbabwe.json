            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFormer leader of the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), Nelson Chamisa, has revealed that his departure from both the CCC and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), was a calculated move aimed at frustrating President Emmerson Mnangagwa, whom he accuses of orchestrating a takeover of the opposition parties.\n\nChamisa resigned as leader of the CCC in January last year, citing the hijacking of his party by Mnangagwa as punishment for his refusal to accept the results of the chaotic August 2023 general elections.\n\nThe fallout from the elections saw Sengezo Tshabangu emerge, seemingly from nowhere, claiming to be the interim Secretary General of the CCC.\n\nTshabangus stated aim was to restore order within the opposition by addressing alleged irregularities in the candidate selection process leading up to the 2023 elections.\n\nTshabangu subsequently initiated a widespread recall of elected representatives, claiming that certain candidates had been improperly selected.\n\nThis led to the unprecedented recall of over 40 MPs and councillors, effectively handing Zanu-PF back the two-thirds parliamentary majority it had failed to secure during the harmonised elections.\n\nChamisas attempts to prevent these recalls, including written appeals to the then Local Government Minister July Moyo and Speaker of the National Assembly Jacob Mudenda, proved futile. The courts upheld the recalls, leaving Chamisa with no option but to step aside.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Thursday, Chamisa confirmed that his decision to leave the CCC was motivated by a desire to spite Mnangagwa.\n\nThe best decision I ever made in my leadership journey was to walk away from MDC & CCC. You will thank me later. I had to break the cycle of going in circles. And that was my best way to teach ED a lesson!, Chamisa declared.\n\nThis was not Chamisas first departure from a major political entity. He had previously walked away from the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) after a Supreme Court ruling questioned the legitimacy of his assumption of the party leadership following the death of Morgan Tsvangirai.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA dramatic power struggle has unfolded within the MDC-T party as Vice President Elias Mudzuri, allegedly in collaboration with Morgen Komichi, launched a bid to oust the partys embattled leader, Douglas Mwonzora, and seize control of Harvest House  the party headquarters in Harare CBD.\n\nThe move comes on the heels of a High Court ruling in late February 2025, in which Justice Hapias Zhou ordered Mwonzora to resign and facilitate a fresh congress within six months.\n\nThe ruling cited irregularities in the 2022 MDC-T Extraordinary Congress that saw Mwonzora elevated to the party leadership.\n\nMudzuri is arguing that, in light of Justice Zhous ruling, he is now the rightful leader of the party, by virtue of his position as Vice President.\n\nMudzuri arrived at Harvest House this morning with a considerable entourage, but was met with fierce resistance from Mwonzoras militant youth supporters, who aggressively blocked his entry.\n\nPolice intervention was ultimately required to prevent the situation from escalating further.\n\nMudzuri was seen leavingin his black Toyota Land Cruiser amidst the commotion.\n\nEarlier, Mudzuri had reportedly ordered Mwonzoras supporters and loyalists to vacate the building, prompting a heated confrontation.\n\nThis resulted in the arrival of truckloads of police officers in riot gear.\n\nMudzuri then briefly disappeared before resurfacing, claiming he had visited Harare Central Police Station to request a police escort to facilitate his occupation of Harvest House.\n\nMwonzora is no longer the President, as per the High Court ruling in February 2025. There is a void in the party presidency that must be filled, claimed one of Mudzuris security personnel, who requested anonymity.\n\nHowever, Albert Chidhakwa, the MDC National Youth Chairman and leader of Mwonzoras militant youth faction at Harvest House, insisted that Mudzuris actions are premature and invalid, as the party has lodged an appeal against Justice Zhous ruling.\n\nThe party has appealed Justice Zhous ruling. Mudzuri cannot rely on the High Court ruling because the appeal has rendered it ineffective. President Mwonzora remains the party leader. There is no change to that, he stated.\n\nThe battle for control of Harvest House has been a long-standing source of conflict within the opposition. It intensified following the Supreme Courts decision in March 2020 to nullify Nelson Chamisas ascendancy to the party presidency after the death of founding leader, Morgan Tsvangirai in 2018.\n\nWhile Mwonzora, in his then role as Secretary General, assumed leadership, he has struggled to maintain stability within the party. Many members defected to Chamisa and later to his Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), which was officially formed in 2022.\n\nMwonzoras party chose not to participate in the 2023 elections, citing concerns over irregularities in the delimitation exercise.\n\n",

Does SZA think shes more successful than me? Lol yall catch me up pls. SZA, if every song youve ever done vanished right now, the music business wouldnt even miss you.\n\nIn this lengthy tweet, the Trinidadian-born rapper went on to claim that other countries that she has been to have no clue who SZA is and the singer has not even headlined a concert that consists of 80 000 attendees.\n\nShe added: Boo, Im an icon. Youre not.\n\nWhile you would think that it was the end, you are wrong because Minaj followed up with a series of tweets calling SZA a weirdo after Minajs fanbase shared screenshots of SZA bashing other women in the music industry, including Rihanna, Beyonce and even the rapper herself.\n\nLike do you know the level of inside HATE for yourself you had to have had to be this much of a cunt for no reason to the women you later worked with?

The nation is assured that these inmates pose no threat to the country or its citizens, government spokesperson Thabile Mdluli said in a statement.\n\nEswatini and the US will work with the United Nations immigration agency to facilitate the transit of the deportees to their country of origin, Mdluli added.\n\nEarlier this month, the USsent eight migrants from several countries to South Sudanafter a court lifted restrictions on sending people to countries where they have no ties.\n\nIn a series of posts on the X social media platform, McLaughlin listed the crimes the five deported to Eswatini had been convicted of, describing them as depraved monsters who had been terrorizing American communities.\n\nA safe third country deportation flight to Eswatini in Southern Africa has landed, she said, adding: They are off of American soil.\n\nThe Eswatini government declined to say whether any payments were made as part of the arrangement.\n\nThe US is the fourth largest market for the countrys biggest export, sugar. Analysts suggest that Eswatini may be trying to safeguard this trade and avoid the imposition of tariffs.\n\nA pro-democracy group, the Swazi Solidarity Network, has condemned the deal as deplorable.\n\nSpokesperson Lucky Lukhele told the BBC that Eswatini must not become a dumping ground for criminals, and that citizens needed protection.\n\nThe news has sparked public concern over whether local prisons are equipped to securely house such inmates.\n\nPreviously known as Swaziland, Eswatini is a small, landlocked country that is surrounded by South Africa and Mozambique. It has been led by King Mswati III since 1986.\n\nLast month, the US Supreme Court cleared the way for the Trump administration to resume deporting migrants to countries other than their own.\n\nRwanda has confirmed discussions have taken place, while Benin, Angola, Equatorial Guinea and Moldova have also been named in media reports as potential recipient countries.\n\nTrumps administration has already deported people to El Salvadorand Costa Rica.\n\nSouth Sudan recently agreed to hold eight men deported from the US and said they were not in handcuffs and appeared to be in good condition.\n\nThe war-torn country said the deportees were kept in a civilian facility in the capital Juba, under the watch of police and the national security service. Only one of them is from South Sudan.\n\nIn April, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio revoked all visas for South Sudanese passport holders blaming the country for failing to accept the return of its repatriated citizens in a timely manner.\n\nIt is not clear if that has now changed.\n\nLast week, Nigeria said it would not bow to pressure from the Trump administration to accept Venezuelan deportees or third-country prisoners from the US.\n\nPresident Donald Trumps pledge to conduct mass deportations was a centrepiece of his election campaign and an issue on which he drew widespread support, including many Hispanic voters.\n\nHe said he wanted to deport people living in the US illegally but White House efforts have been much broader in scope  taking aim at people in the US on student visas, suspending admissions of refugees except white South Africans, and moving to revoke temporary work permits and other protections that had been granted to immigrants by previous presidents.\n\nTo crack down on immigrants, Trumps administration has resumed raids at workplaces, a tactic that had been suspended under his predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\n",
