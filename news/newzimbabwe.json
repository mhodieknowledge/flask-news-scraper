            "content": "ByStaff Reporter\n\nRhodes University postdoctoral fellow and Zimbabwean journalist and media activist, Dr. Garikai Chaunza, has been appointed Co-Chair of the Local Organising Committee (LOC) for the African University Seminar Series  South Africa (AUSS-SA), a flagship programme of the Social Science Research Councils APDD initiative.\n\nThe appointment, confirmed in a letter from APDD programme director Dr Cyril Obi, recognises Chaunzas outstanding qualifications and his demonstrable commitment to strengthening research, academic convening, and collaborative knowledge production across the continent\n\nChaunzas selection reflects a career grounded in media activism, resistance journalism, and community-centred storytelling, shaped by nearly two decades working across Zimbabwes most contested media environments.\n\nBefore entering academia, he reported for ZBC, Radio VOP, NewZimbabwe.com, Deutsche Welle, Radio Netherlands, Free Speech Radio News (FSRN), KPFA Pacifica Radio, and other international outlets, often covering press freedom violations, political repression, and community struggles.\n\nAs Chair of the MISA Zimbabwe Harare Committee between 2015 and 2021, he led campaigns for community radio licensing, legal defence for journalists, and broader media reform during periods of state surveillance and shrinking civic space.\n\nNow based at Rhodes Universitys School of Journalism and Media Studies as a postdoctoral fellow, Chaunza teaches radio and audio studies while supervising postgraduate students.\n\nHis recent doctoral work, Activist Radio and the Struggle to Empower Audiences, examined how underground radio and alternative audio platforms challenge state narratives in hybrid regimes.\n\nColleagues describe his approach as a fusion of theory and hands-on journalistic practice, linking scholarly critique with lived experience in hostile media environments.\n\nThe AUSS-SA appointment will place Chaunza at the centre of a continental effort to convene scholars, practitioners and alumni for national seminars led by the LOC.\n\nAccording to the APDD, the initiative aims to strengthen a self-organised intellectual community capable of shaping national and regional research agendas, while promoting equity, diversity, and representation across South African institutions.\n\nIn his new role, Chaunza will coordinate academic panels, mobilise university partners across the country, and contribute to building an APDD alumni network grounded in African perspectives.\n\nThis aligns with his long-standing advocacy for decolonial media education, community storytelling, and African-led communication research, commitments reflected in his teaching, public scholarship and ongoing creative audio projects.\n\nChaunzas academic credentials include a PhD in Journalism and Media Studies from Rhodes University, an MSc and Postgraduate Diploma in Media and Society Studies (MSU), a BA in Media Studies (ZOU), and Diploma in Public Relations (ZIPR), and a certificate in Digital Marketing (UZ). He is also a recipient of the SSRC Next Generation Social Sciences Fellowship (2023).\n\nThe appointment marks a return to organised scholarly activism for a journalist whose career has consistently bridged research, teaching, and frontline media work. For many observers in the journalism education sector, Chaunza represents a generation of scholar-practitioners pushing for African media curricula rooted in community knowledge, public accountability, and resistance to repression.\n\n",

            "content": "By BBC\n\nPOPE Leo has held an audience with Hollywood stars, urging actors and directors including Cate Blanchett, Viggo Mortensen and Monica Bellucci to continue their work as pilgrims of the imagination, helping to bring hope.\n\nThe celebrity meeting was a sprinkling of star dust for a still relatively new pope and a way for the Catholic Church to engage more with the world beyond.It was also a strong show of support from Leo XIV for the global film industry, as he spoke out against the troubling decline in cinema-going.Hailed by director Spike Lee as a great day, the gathering was the first of its kind in the Vatican.Beneath the magnificent frescoes of the Clementine Hall, Pope Leo spoke in Italian to praise the power of cinema to entertain and to educate  and for its capacity to amaze.But he urged filmmakers not to shy away from what he called the worlds wounds.Violence, poverty, exile, loneliness, addiction and forgotten wars are issues that need to be acknowledged and narrated, the Pope said.Good cinema does not exploit pain; it recognizes and explores it. This is what all the great directors have done.Six months since a conclave of cardinals elected the first North American to the Papacy, some Catholics feel that Leo has been slow to stamp his own mark on the role.His predecessor, Francis, was a charismatic Argentinian known for his off-the-cuff comments and dramatic gestures. Leos style is far quieter, so this star-studded engagement is a new look.Its not clear how the cast list was drawn up, although none of the directors in the hall  who came from all over the world  made it onto the Popes own top film list.This week, the Vatican revealed that his favourite four watches of all time included the 1960s nun-themed classic The Sound of Music, Its a Wonderful Life and Italian Roberto Benignis multi award-winning Life is Beautiful.Among those who did join todays A-list audience were Mortensen, Chris Pine and filmmaker Gus Van Sant  of Milk and Good Will Hunting fame. The large Italian contingent included Gianni Amelio and Cinema Paradiso creator, Giuseppe Tornatore.At a time of immense pressure on film, not long after a major Hollywood strike and with funding strains here in Italy, the Pope spoke in defence of the industry.He was applauded loudly when he talked of the quiet dedication of all those behind the scenes with vital roles.He also warned against the closure of cinemas which he characterised as the beating heart of communities.More than a few people are saying that the art of cinema and the cinematic experience are in danger. I urge institutions not to give up, but to cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value of this activity, the Pope said.After a fifteen-minute speech and a blessing he then received each audience member in turn, led by Blanchett.He really urged us to go back into our day jobs and inspire people, the Australian-born star told reporters.One of many who came bearing gifts, the actress  who works with the UN refugee agency, UNHCR  placed a woven bracelet in the Popes hand. It was a bracelet I wear in solidarity with people who are displaced, she explained later.Lee handed the Chicago-born Pope a New York Knicks shirt printed with the number 14 and the words Pope Leo.\n\nThe celebrity meeting was a sprinkling of star dust for a still relatively new pope and a way for the Catholic Church to engage more with the world beyond.\n\nIt was also a strong show of support from Leo XIV for the global film industry, as he spoke out against the troubling decline in cinema-going.Hailed by director Spike Lee as a great day, the gathering was the first of its kind in the Vatican.Beneath the magnificent frescoes of the Clementine Hall, Pope Leo spoke in Italian to praise the power of cinema to entertain and to educate  and for its capacity to amaze.But he urged filmmakers not to shy away from what he called the worlds wounds.Violence, poverty, exile, loneliness, addiction and forgotten wars are issues that need to be acknowledged and narrated, the Pope said.Good cinema does not exploit pain; it recognizes and explores it.

This entitlement they have to South Africa is sickening.She added that the more South African government keeps nursing Zimbabweans and making them feel like they have rights, the more they start believing they have bigger rights than South Africans.Ngobese-Zuma said the influx of undocumented Zimbabweans has created resentment among locals, describing their attitude as intrusive and entitled.Ngobese-Zuma: Zimbabwean men have become cowardsThe activist went further, calling Zimbabwean men cowards for fleeing their country instead of confronting their political leadership.The reason we have entitled people like Dube here is because the men of Zimbabwe have become cowards. They no longer want to fight for Zimbabwe, they want to fight for South Africa, she said.She urged Zimbabweans to return home and challenge President Emmerson Mnangagwas regime instead of depending on South Africa for economic refuge.Whether there is Operation Dudula or March in March, that is none of Zimbabweans business. Their job is to fix their country, she said.Ngobese-Zuma urges Zimbabweans to Go back home and fix their countryShe lamented the growing number of Zimbabweans crossing into South Africa, accusing them of using migration as a shortcut rather than addressing the root causes of their countrys crisis.Now every minute someone in Zimbabwe has a problem, the solution is to come to South Africa. What kind of solution is that? Who is staying behind in Zimbabwe?
