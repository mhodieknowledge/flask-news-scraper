It can be waived or forfeited where the beneficiary is at fault.\n\nIn dismissing the application, the judges acknowledged the importance of maintaining the integrity of the disciplinary process, warning against setting a precedent that would allow employees to sidestep disciplinary consequences.\n\nIf participants were allowed to pull out of these processes without consequence and subsequently seek a review the whole labour dispute resolution mechanism would face certain collapse, the judgment read.\n\n",

Failure to pay monthly rentals is a serious breach of the agreement of lease which mandates City of Harare to evoke the conditions of lease and recover holding costs from the same.\n\nNotwithstanding the availability or none of the lease agreement, council shall not be prejudiced in its rights to recover holding costs from the lessee for breach of mutual understanding, read the notice.\n\nThe notice comes on the back of Harare City, on the drive to recover money it is being owed by tenants leasing their properties.\n\nHowever, in Mbare, Harare City is under pressure to renovate the flats which are becoming uninhabitable.\n\nLast year, the High Court ordered Harare City Council to renovate the flats to match decent living standards. The City fathers have appealed the judgement.\n\nIn an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) director, Ruben Akili, said the deplorable living conditions have dissuaded tenants from paying their rentals.\n\nThese are the same flats which we had a court order for renovations. As you are aware all the flats in Mbare were supposed to be renovated. The situation in Mbare is unacceptable sewer is gushing all over and many things are just happening and many things are happening.\n\nFrom CHRAs perspective is that some residents are paying and some are not paying. Local Authority should address the fundamental problems that speaks to the reasons why residents are not paying, said Akili.\n\n",

In Harare, a man was killed on Delport Road in Hatfield on 12 August after being hit by a Toyota Spade, while another was injured on High Glen Road the previous day.\n\nDespite commending public service operators for cooperation during the period, police urged motorists to service vehicles, avoid speeding, and adhere strictly to road rules.\n\nAbove all, drivers should adhere to all road rules and regulations in order to curb the continuous loss of lives through road traffic accidents, Nyathi said.\n\n",
