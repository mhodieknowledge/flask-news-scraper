She was granted US$200 bail after spending three nights behind bars.\n\nThrough its lawyer Chris Mhike, AMH challenged placement on remand, arguing that the charge does not disclose an offence.\n\nMhike said in a democratic state, one cannot be arrested for expressing his or her opinion where there is freedom of the media and expression.\n\nThe arrest amounts to restrictions of the right of access to information.\n\nThe disregard of fundamental rights of the accused amount to violation of principle of democracy, he said.\n\nThe lawyer said when the company is placed on remand the state has restricted it from performing its duties to inform the public which is its mandate.\n\nJournalism is not a crime, by placing the company on remand means criminalisation of journalism.\n\nOne consenting to placement on remand means youre admitting to committing the offence, Mhike said.\n\nTakudzwa Jambawu representing the state said there is reasonable suspicion that an offence was committed.\n\nHe said it is not in dispute that Mnangagwa is the current SADC chairperson and the words contained in the article were insulting his authority.\n\nAccording to the state on June 7 2025 accused through the Zimbabwe Independent newspaper edition of 27 June 2025 to 3 July 2025 published an article titled When you become mafia state, intending to undermine the authority of the President by saying: In less than two months, our one year rotating chairmanship of SADC comes to an end and we hope it is not just Muckraker, who has not seen any value that our time in that important role has added to the regional bloc apart from just confirming the obvious fears that SADC is a mere trade union of dictators.\n\nIn the few months that we have been in that role, we have been implicated in the chaos that has rocked most neighbouring countries. We were implicated in the massive vote rigging in Mozambican elections-with proof that our people actually voted for Daniel Chapo in an election in whose disputed outcome resulted in the death of hundreds of people. We were also fingered in the elections in Botswana and Namibia, where our electoral rigging machinery was heavily deployed.\n\nWhen you have become a mafia state, and are known to arm fellow criminals from around the globe with your diplomatic passports, it has become very hard to stop your people from believing just anything.\n\nThere is certainly no doubt who is micro Managing this Chapo chap, so there is not even any need to wonder what our Owner thought when his boy was addressing a virtually empty stadium very soon the boy would have developed a thick skin, just hike his handler who no longer needs to do anything under the cover of the darkness. That is what happens when you become the head of a mafia state.  It is a government that came into power through a coup and is only obsessed with keeping itself in power hence the creation of demons such as the Tshabangus and the like, themselves creations of courts whose top judges are themselves appointed -and kept on  the bench via political chicanery, all to serve the purpose of keeping this criminal enterprise masquerading as a government in power.\n\nThe state alleges that the accused attached a photograph of President Emerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa and Mozambican President Daniel Chapo.\n\nThe state alleges the article was false in material and was designed to engender feelings of hostility by the citizens of Zimbabwe towards the President.\n\nHearing continues Friday.\n\n",

            "content": "AP\n\nTwo-time Olympic champion runner Caster Semenya won a partial victory at the European Court of Human Rights on Thursday in her seven-year legal fight against track and fields sex eligibility rules.\n\nThe courts 17-judge highest chambersaid in a 15-2 votethat Semenya had some of her rights to a fair hearing violated at Switzerlands Supreme Court,where she had appealedagainst a ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport in favor of tracks World Athletics.\n\nHowever, the court declined to rule on several other aspects of Semenyas case, including on the question of whether she was discriminated against in Swiss courts. The European court in Strasbourg, France, said those issues were outside Switzerlands jurisdiction, although four of the 17 judges gave a partial dissent to the majority view.\n\nSemenyas case should now go back to the Swiss federal court in Lausanne. It will be watched closely by other sports which have passed or are reviewing their own rules on eligibility in womens events.\n\nSemenya laterposted on social mediaa photo of herself in the court chamber with a message a three raised fists symbolizing her fight for justice.\n\nToday, my patience in this journey has been rewarded with a result that will pave the way for all athletes human rights to be protected, she said in a statement.\n\nThe original case between Semenya and tracks governing body based in Monaco was about whether athletes like her  who have specific medical conditions, a typical male chromosome pattern and naturally high testosterone levels  should be allowed to compete freely in womens sports.\n\nThe European courts ruling does not overturn the World Athletics rules that effectively ended Semenyas career running the 800 meters after she won two Olympic and three world titles since emerging on the global stage as a teenager in 2009.\n\nThe judges also did not take up other aspects of the appeal filed by Semenya, who was in court to hear their judgment read. It awarded her 80,000 euros ($94,000) from the state of Switzerland in respect of costs and expenses.\n\nThe key legal point in Semenyas win was that the Swiss Federal Court had not carried out a rigorous judicial review. This was required because Semenya had no choice but to pursue her case through the CASs mandatory and exclusive jurisdiction. the Strasbourg judges ruled.\n\nGoverning bodies of sports oblige athletes and national federations to take their disputes to the sports court in the International Olympic Committees home city Lausanne.\n\nThe court considered, however, that the Federal Supreme Courts review had fallen short of that requirement, it said in a statement.\n\nIn dismissing other elements of the South African runners case, including if she had been discriminated against, the court judged it did not fall within Switzerlands jurisdiction in respect of those complaints.\n\nWorld Athletics, led by its president Sebastian Coe, has said its rules maintain fairness because Semenya has an unfair, male-like athletic advantage from her higher testosterone. Semenya argues her testosterone is a genetic gift.\n\nWorld Athletics and CAS did not immediately respond to the ruling. The IOC declined to comment on a case it is not directly involved in.\n\nThursdays win followed a legal victory from the same court two years ago for Semenya.\n\nThat judgment which said she had faced discrimination opened a way for the Swiss supreme court to reconsider its decision to dismiss her appeal against the CAS verdict in favor of World Athletics.\n\nAt CAS in 2019, three judges ruled 2-1 that discrimination against Semenya was necessary, reasonable and proportionate to maintain fairness in womens track events.\n\nWorld Athletics drew up its rules in 2018 forcing Semenya and other female athletes with Differences in Sex Development to suppress their testosterone to be eligible for international womens events.\n\nFour of the 17 judges filed a partial dissent to the majority opinion, arguing their court should have been able to pronounce on substantive conclusions reached by the CAS that went against Semenya.\n\nWorld Athletics eligibility rules specifically targeted the applicant, since they concerned only the events in which she competed  indeed, the fact that they amounted to a kind of lex Semenya clearly demonstrates the arbitrariness of those regulations as a whole, the four judges wrote.\n\nWe are disappointed that her expectations have not been met, said the dissenting judges, who included the chamber president, Marko Bonjak from Slovenia.\n\n",

            "content": "Medicalbrief\n\nSouth Africa  TheNational Department of Healthhas condemned the action taken by some groups to prevent foreign nationals from accessing essential healthcare services around the country, after campaigners in both Gauteng and KwaZulu-Natal blocked clinic and hospital entry to migrant patients, demanding proof of identity before anyone was allowed in.\n\nThis week, members ofOperation Dudulain Gauteng and of theMarch and Marchmovement in KZN began manning the entrances of government facilities that includedAddington HospitalandGateway Clinicin Durban,RK Khan Hospitalin Chatsworth, andHillbrow Clinicas well asRosettenville Clinic,south of Johannesburg, in a bid to prevent alleged undocumented foreigners from seeking health services.\n\nThe Mercuryreports that they accosted patients at the gate and demanded they show ID documents to confirm they were South African nationals.\n\nIn Rosettenville last week, foreign nationals were barred from the local clinic by the protesters who said they were fed up with the long queues that mostly comprised illegal foreign nationals and who, they added, are placing a strain on the facilitys already stretched resources, reportsKaya959.\n\nThey said the clinic was on the brink of collapse, having already stretched its resources to provide free healthcare  mostly to migrants.\n\nClinic management denied allegations that it was turning people away, saying it was attending to everyone walking into the health facility, reportseNCA. Some patients in the queue said they had been waiting for assistance for a week.\n\nPut SA First\n\nDaily Maverickreports that the various anti-migrant groups broadly fall under the Put South Africa First banner  including Operation Dudula, thePatriotic Alliance(PA) and several smaller community groups.\n\nThe groups are demanding that South Africans be prioritised over undocumented migrants  whom they want deported  for economic opportunities and services, like healthcare, accusing them of burdening the countrys health system to the detriment of locals.\n\nThey demanded proof of our nationalities and denied us access because we are not South Africans. The clinic has our clinic cards because we come here for medical attention, said a young mother who was at the Rosettenville Clinic to have her baby vaccinated.\n\nThe Immigration Act stipulates that only immigration officers and members of theSouth African Police Service(SAPS) have the authority to ask citizens and foreign nationals to produce valid documentation.\n\nAt the Hillbrow Community Clinic, where members of the PA, along with a small group of residents and members of Operation Dudula, denied access to foreign nationals, an off-duty security officer toldDaily Maverickthat the (anti-foreigner) groups that have been coming here are not happy with the matron.\n\nThey feel she is siding with the foreign nationals, and when they came on Friday, some demanded to speak to the clinics provincial manager, he said.\n\nAt the Rosettenville Clinic, where community members stood guard at the gates screening patients, Aneliswa Dutshwa, who spoke on behalf of the local anti-migrant group, claimed South African voters concerns were not being taken seriously by the government.\n\nWe want Immigration and Home Affairs to be visible. We are not taking a break until they are both visible, Dutshwa said.\n\nForeign nationals who were barred from entering the facility said they were also being denied a chance to take their clinic cards so they could seek help elsewhere.\n\nSome said they could afford private healthcare, but, pointed out oneZimbabwean who was at the clinic to collect medication, private health facilities require their clinic cards, with their full medical history. Without their cards they could not go anywhere else.\n\nI would have left already because its clear that they will not allow us in, but I want my clinic card because private health facilities require those. If they can give me my card, I will leave, she said.\n\nOperation Dulula\n\nOperation Dudula, which has vowed to intensify its operations at health centres, has been calling for the deportation of all undocumented foreign nationals since its emergence in mid-2020.\n\nThe groups Zandile Dabula said they would escalate their operations and also call for doctors who are foreign nationals to be replaced with South Africans, even if the foreigners were legally employed.\n\nThe government has condemned the groups and said it would deploy police to maintain peace and enforce the law at the affected facilities.\n\nGauteng police spokesperson Brigadier Brenda Muridili said: These deployments are as and when needed, and should the need arise, the SAPS will respond to its mandate.\n\nIllegal\n\nDepartment of Health spokesperson Foster Mohale said the reports were concerning.\n\nWe have noted with concern these illegal actions, he said, adding that no one has the right to prevent anyone from medical treatment.\n\nEveryone who happens to be in the country is protected by a number number of prescripts, including Section 27 of the constitution, theNational Health Act, and theRefugees Actof 1998.\n\nWhile there were claims that those seeking health services are illegal in the country, and while the department condemns the action of those who enter the country illegally, he said, no one has the right to take the law into their own hands.\n\nGauteng Health MEC Nomantu Nkomo-Ralehoko indicated that her department has begun engaging concerned community-based organisations involved in the campaign, adding that while they noted the concerns by some groups, our Constitution allows everybody to access healthcare services, so it becomes difficult for us to chase people away.\n\nTheSouth African Human Rights Commission(SAHRC) said the rise in complaints from people being turned away from facilities was unlawful, discriminatory, and an infringement on human rights, reportsIOL.\n\nSection 27(1) of the Constitution clearly states that everyone has the right to have access to . services, including reproductive healthcare, it said in a statement.\n\nThe SAHRC has urged health departments and provincial leaders to address critical issues plaguing the sector, like staff shortages, long waiting times, and insufficient bed availability, saying these challenges, compounded by discriminatory practices, exacerbate healthcare inequity in an already strained system.\n\nMeanwhile, theForum for South Africa(FOSA) said the Human Rights Commission is failing in its arguments as it advocates for undocumented migrants to access healthcare services in this country.\n\nThe organisation added that illegal foreign nationals taking advantage of national health services arenot only affecting South Africans, but other legal documented foreign nationals.\n\nThey burden the system while accessing medications earmarked for citizens and documented migrants, said the organisations spokesperson, Tebogo Mashilompane.\n\n",

With the added cost of the sugar tax, the impact of the sugar cost is a key determinant of the viability of our business.\n\nThe high cost of sugar is in addition to the recently introduced sugar tax, which is equivalent to another US$100/MT.\n\nAccording to Makamure, prices of sugar-added soft drinks increased by between 15% to 45% following the introduction of the tax in February 2024.\n\nThe highest increases were on cordials such as Mazoe Orange Crush. The process of cordials has been moderated since January 2025 after the surtax was halved to $0.0005/g.\n\nHe said most beverage producers had reported a miscalculated volume performance since February 2024, with most players absorbing the sugar tax by maintaining discounted prices to avoid a volume collapse whilst awaiting the much-needed review of the tax levels by the authorities.\n\nThe duties and surtaxes penalise the manufacturers even when they have no alternative but to access local supplies.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Sugar Association reports that they had in excess of 16,000 tons of carry-over bottler-grade sugar stocks from the 2024 milling season and there will be over 90,000 tons of uncommitted sugar stocks from the 2025 milling season.\n\nMakamure added that the sugar tax further compounds operational challenges, calling for urgent policy reviews to support the local industry.\n\nZimbabwe is a net exporter of sugar and attracts reciprocal tariffs from other countries.\n\nThe main suppliers of refined sugar are StarAfrica (Goldstar Sugars)and Tongaat Hullets (Hippo Valley & Triangle).\n\nAdded Makamure, Over the years, they have failed to meet the quantity and quality requirements.\n\nGiven these challenges, the Industry and Commerce ministry agreed with the bottlers to supplement their requirements from imports.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) finds itself once again locking horns with university authorities, this time demanding the reinstatement of members suspended from state universities.\n\nThe union is accusing three universities, Midlands State University (MSU), Great Zimbabwe University (GZU) and the University of Zimbabwe (UZ) of what it calls a flagrant violation of both domestic and international human rights law.\n\nThe suspended students stand accused of breaching conduct regulations, allegedly brandishing placards on campus and calling for a resolution to the ongoing lecturers strike.\n\nIn a letter dated 7 July 2025, and served to the students on Tuesday, UZ Vice Chancellor Paul Mapufmo stated that the six had contravened rule 3.1.4 of the Rules of Student Conduct and Discipline, 1984 Ordinance 30, by moving around campus inciting fellow students to join the lecturers protests.\n\nIt was brought to my attention that on the 12th of May 2025 at around 1210 hours, while in the company of Blessing Mtisi, Nodeshar Maingehama, Tafadzwa Katsande Masimba, Tawananyasha Hove and Mtukura Tariro were found holding unlawful demonstration at the University Halls of Residence.\n\nYou were moving one hall of residence to another, one dining hall to another, addressing fellow students and inciting them to join you to hold placards and chant slogans against the University Administration.\n\nAccordingly in light of the seriousness of the allegations detailed above, I have found it necessary to, in terms of section 8 (3) (e) of the University of Zimbabwe Act,[ Chapter 25:16], (the act) to suspend you with immediate effect, from your studies at the University of Zimbabwe indefinitely pending disciplinary hearing against you.\n\nIn response, ZINASU President Emmanuel Sitima issued three key demands, asserting that Mapfumos actions reflect a deliberate and systematic effort to criminalise dissent and suppress the agency of students as political and civic actors.\n\nSuch repressive conduct is not only morally indefensible, but legally unsustainable. The Constitution of Zimbabwe (2013), which stands as the supreme law of the Republic, guarantees the freedom of expression (Section 61), freedom of assembly and association (Section 58), and the right to peaceful demonstration and petition (Section 59), said Sitima.\n\nSitima further insisted that the suspended students must be reinstated immediately and without conditions.\n\nThe immediate and unconditional reinstatement of all students unlawfully suspended or expelled. A thorough and independent investigation into the abuse of university disciplinary procedures for political ends. Firm guarantees from the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education affirming the protection of student rights in accordance with the Constitution, he declared.\n\nThe dispute comes as UZ lecturers have been on strike since April, demanding fair wages. At one point, even President Emmerson Mnangagwas spokesman, George Charamba, conceded that the US$230 being offered to lecturers at UZ was a concern, pledging that his boss had approved salary increments.\n\nThe university has responded to the industrial action by suspending protesting lecturers and replacing them with what students are derisively calling virgins in the academic setting, ill-equipped to handle the demands of the job.\n\n",
