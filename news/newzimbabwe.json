Police have since established that Mlambo is a South African national.\n\nEarlier,IOL reported that thegrey SUV that was driven by Mlambo in Limpopo was reported stolen earlier this month, around Pretoria Central.\n\nProvincial police spokesperson in Limpopo, Brigadier Hlulani Mashaba said the grey SUV was reported stolen earlier this month, around Pretoria central.

It was searched and police suddenly discovered a damaged tracking device removed from the vehicle, said Mashaba.\n\nThe 31-year-old man driving the stolen vehicle could not produce authentic documentation proving ownership, and he was immediately placed under arrest.\n\nThe arrested driver was charged for possession of a suspected stolen motor vehicle.\n\nProvincial police spokesperson in Limpopo, Brigadier Hlulani Mashaba said the grey SUV was reported stolen earlier this month, around Pretoria central.

During the stop, one male suspect fled into nearby bushes, while two female suspects attempted to escape but were apprehended after a foot chase, said Mashaba.\n\nThe women aged 19 and 20 were arrested, and are facing charges of possession of a suspected stolen motor vehicle.\n\nA man escaped on foot, evading arrest while two women aged 19 and 20 were arrested for possession of a Toyota Hilux GD-6 double cab bakkie.

The driver, a 34-year-old undocumented foreign national, was arrested, said Mashaba.\n\n",

ZLHR further argues that the impugned provisions of the PVO Amendment Act were vague and badly drafted and contained arbitrary powers and over-regulation of PVOs, said ZLHR.\n\nZLHR also said the PVO Amendment Act has the effect of concentrating arbitrary powers in the Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare and the Registrars office and contains excessive executive interference in the internal affairs of PVOs.\n\nIt said the impugned provisions of the PVO Amendment Act have the net effect of effectively allowing the Executive to run PVOs and to deregister those that authorities dislike on very nebulous grounds.\n\nTo this end ZLHR is seeking a High Court order of constitutional invalidity, declaring section 4, section 5 as read with section 9(5), section 6, section 13A, section 14, and section 21, of the Private Voluntary Organisations Act (as amended by the PVO Amendment Act) to be ultra vires the Constitution and to be set aside.\n\n",
