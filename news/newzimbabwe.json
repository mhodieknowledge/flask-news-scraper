It is the generational consensus that Tagwirei must make it because he is young, said Mliswa.\n\nWe have given our liberators time to liberate us from an economic point of view but they have not done what we expected them to do, they have done their best but it is about time that we took over.\n\nWe do not have liberation history but we have economic ability to be able to transform the country and equally transform its fortunes.\n\nMliswa, who was fired from Zanu PF in 2015, has emerged as one of Tagwireis fervent supporters, frequently laying into Chiwenga.\n\nChiwenga is pushing for Tagwireis arrest on a string of corruption allegations. His attempts to get the partys stamp, however, fell by the wayside as he was advised to report all of the alleged graft to Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) or the police.\n\nTagwireis meteoric rise is being supported by claims that he financed the 2017 coup that toppled late leader Robert Mugabe and governments agriculture programme, Command Agriculture.\n\nAdded Mliswa: It is a generational consensus which you cannot stop.\n\nThat is the reason why the opposition moved from the late Morgan Tsvangirai to Nelson Chamisa. Now Zanu PF has moved to Tagwirei.\n\n",

There is a correlation between what happened after midnight,the arson, the abduction of the security guard.\n\nIt was done by people who know the job of fear. They seem to have forgotten that we have endured such harassment for the past two years, said Mandaza.\n\nThe ruling party has endorsed a resolution seeking to extend Mnangagwas presidency to 2030, which would require amending Section 91(2) of the Constitution, which limits a president to two terms, and Section 328(7), which bars incumbents from benefiting from constitutional amendments.\n\nAccording to party insiders, ZANU PF intends to use its parliamentary majority to push through the proposed changes.\n\nSpeaking at the disrupted event, Biti condemned the attacks and reaffirmed the groups commitment to defending the Constitution.\n\nWe are very sorry to Dr. Mandaza over the arson, and to Gilbert Mbwende, whose house was also attacked.\n\nThis is a new initiative by concerned citizens to resist the mutilation of the Constitution.
