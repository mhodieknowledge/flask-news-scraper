On a year-on-year basis, the deficit increased from US$185.9 million in March 2024 to US$228.0 million in the reporting month, the RBZ said.\n\nDuring the period, merchandise imports amounted to US$809.9 million in March 2025, reflecting a 10.9% increase from US$730.4 million recorded in the previous month. On a year-on-year basis, imports rose by 12.4%.\n\nDuring the month under review, most of the countrys imports originated from South Africa (38.2%), China (15.2%), the Bahamas (11.5%), and Mozambique (4.9%), with the rest sourced from a range of other markets.\n\nThe countrys export basket was predominantly composed of primary commodities, with gold leading at 42.4%, followed by PGMs, (16.0%), tobacco (17.1%), and other mineral exports (6.7%).\n\nIn March 2025, the countrys exports were mainly destined for the United Arab Emirates (40.7%), South Africa (24.4%), and China at 20.8%. The remaining exports were spread across various other international markets, said the RBZ.\n\nMarket watchers are of the view that Zimbabweurgently needs to adopt a radical policy shift to spur local industrial productivity to plug the huge foreign currency outflows.\n\n",

If I remember well, we had made a recommendation of not transporting goats from one province to another province, but to do intra-province distributions because of Foot and Mouth Disease, he said.\n\nBasera confirmed that when the Agriculture Ministry asked Blackdeck to supply 500 goats for a launch project in Chipinge, the company delivered.\n\nDzvetero also asked him to confirm that there were also other incidents where the company wrote to the company to supply the goats for other launches, and he said this was correct.\n\nThe court heard that the ministry was supposed to call the guarantor or go for arbitration in cases of conflicts as outlined in the agreement but the ministry did not do so.\n\nBasera said wthat when he left the ministry, plans were being made to call the guarantor.\n\nThe court also heard that the ministry instead went on to request the supply of more goats under the presidential goat pass on scheme despite the conflict which arose.\n\nThe state alleges Blackdeck submitted fraudulent documents to win the US$87 million deal.\n\nIt is alleged that the two were given an advance payment of US$7 million, which they failed to account for, and they both deny the charges.\n\nTrial continues Tuesday.\n\n",
