The appellant did not carry the burden of proof.\n\nCiting theKazingiingizi v Dzinorumaprecedent, the court warned that decisions without clear reasoning are susceptible to being perceived as arbitrary or capricious.\n\nThe court allowed the appeal with costs and ordered that Makani be reinstated without loss of salary or benefits from the date of dismissal.
