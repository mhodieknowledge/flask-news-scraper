            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE trial of former Agriculture Deputy Minister Douglas Karoro took a new twist on Friday with the investigating officer contradicting the States case.\n\nKaroro is accused of fraud, which allegedly led to 700 bags of fertilizers meant for beneficiaries in Mbire under the Presidential Input Scheme being taken from the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) Mushumbi depot.Karoro has denied the allegations saying he is a political victim, denying ever conniving with anyone or ever visiting the GMB Mushumbi depot where the fertilizers were allegedly taken.Chief Inspector Violet Chikuni, who investigated the matter told Regional Magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa that there was no misrepresentation that was made to GMB Mushumbi.Instead, she said, misrepresentation was made to GMB Aspindale where alleged fake Compound D fertilisers were allegedly swapped with Ammonium Nitrate, which was then taken back to GMB Mushumbi.This was a direct contradiction to the States case that had been presented and argued from the onset that the alleged misrepresentation was made to GMB Mushumbi resulting in 700 bags of fertilisers being siphoned.The defence led by Admire Rubaya showed her the charge sheet which was being used in court against the former parliamentarian and three others and she confirmed there was no allegation that misrepresentation happened at GMB Aspindale or that fake fertilisers were used to conduct the alleged swap.There was no misrepresentation at Mushumbi. Misrepresentation happened at GMB Aspindale where fake fertilisers were swapped for AN, she said.Chikuni claimed Karoro sold the fertilizers and received US$10,000 for his own use. She however conceded that there was no evidence of Karoro communicating or transacting with the alleged buyer of fertilizers.Cornered by the defence, she conceded she ought to have obtained call records and triangulation reports for the alleged communication with the buyer and his people in Mushumbi.She, further, found it difficult to prove the sale after the defence asked her to provide evidence that money exchanged hands to which she responded saying there was no documentary evidence.Chikuni further claimed Karoro phoned officials at GMB Aspindale to have them release the AN fertilizer in exchange of Compound D as a cover up to the allegations.She was asked to provide call history between Karoro and GMB officials for the alleged phone calls which she did not have.The defence said her lack of evidence before the court shows that she was being used and misused by Karoros political rivals Now Gumbo and Takesure Chikwamba, who were identified in open court by Rubaya as having proceeded to court to ensure that she tows the line.The two, Gumbo and Chikwamba, who are Zanu PF District Coordinating Committee chairman and security secretary respectively, were seated in court when they were blasted for fabricating the case against Karoro and contaminating evidence by conducting their parallel investigations which include getting documents at GMB Mushumbi.The defence said Chikuni launched her investigation based on contaminated evidence given to her by Karoros foes in Mushumbi.This came after she told the court that she got to know about the allegations through an informer whom she could not name.The top cop said she was prepared to lose the case than divulge the informers name.She alleged that the informer was a GMB Mushumbi employee resulting in the defence arguing that she investigated the matter taking evidence from a poisoned well.It was put to her that there was nothing for her to hide as Chikwamba told the court in the previous session that he was the one who took the report to the police.The matter continues on August 5.\n\nKaroro is accused of fraud, which allegedly led to 700 bags of fertilizers meant for beneficiaries in Mbire under the Presidential Input Scheme being taken from the Grain Marketing Board (GMB) Mushumbi depot.\n\nKaroro has denied the allegations saying he is a political victim, denying ever conniving with anyone or ever visiting the GMB Mushumbi depot where the fertilizers were allegedly taken.Chief Inspector Violet Chikuni, who investigated the matter told Regional Magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa that there was no misrepresentation that was made to GMB Mushumbi.Instead, she said, misrepresentation was made to GMB Aspindale where alleged fake Compound D fertilisers were allegedly swapped with Ammonium Nitrate, which was then taken back to GMB Mushumbi.This was a direct contradiction to the States case that had been presented and argued from the onset that the alleged misrepresentation was made to GMB Mushumbi resulting in 700 bags of fertilisers being siphoned.The defence led by Admire Rubaya showed her the charge sheet which was being used in court against the former parliamentarian and three others and she confirmed there was no allegation that misrepresentation happened at GMB Aspindale or that fake fertilisers were used to conduct the alleged swap.There was no misrepresentation at Mushumbi.

            "content": "By Business Insider\n\nCHINAS push to globalize its currency, the yuan, is gaining traction in Africa, with the continent emerging as a strategic testing ground for Beijings broader de-dollarization ambitions.\n\nIn a recent milestone, the central banks of China and Egypt signed a series of agreements to increase yuan use in bilateral trade and investment.\n\nThe deals, signed during Chinese Premier Li Qiangs visit to Cairo last week, were praised by Peoples Bank of China governor Pan Gongsheng as a key step in advancing economic ties between the two countries.\n\nKey provisions include electronic payment cooperation such as expanding Chinas UnionPay system in Egypt, and enabling cross-border yuan-denominated transactions for banks operating in the China-Egypt TEDA Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone.\n\nThese financial operations will be processed through the Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), Chinas alternative to the SWIFT network, thereby reducing reliance on Western financial systems.\n\nWith this development, Egypt now joins a growing list of African nations, including South Africa, Nigeria, and Angola, that are actively incorporating the yuan into their trade and financial dealings with China.\n\nChinas growing currency ambition in Africa\n\nThe expansion of the yuan across Africa is part of Chinas broader strategy to challenge the dominance of the U.S. dollar.\n\nThis move aligns with the continents gradual shift away from Western financial systems toward a China-Russia-led coalition under BRICS, reflecting a strategic effort to diversify trade and currency frameworks.\n\nChina-Africa trade reached $282 billion in 2023, cementing Chinas 15-year run as the continents top trading partner. The surge has boosted renminbi use in cross-border deals and reserve holdings.\n\nBeyond Egypt, where the central banks recently signed agreements to deepen yuan usage in trade and investment, China has steadily advanced its currency diplomacy across Africa.\n\nAs early as 2015, South Africa signed a 30 billion yuan swap deal to improve trade liquidity. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) explained that the three-year agreement was designed to facilitate trade and investment and serve as a buffer for short-term balance of payment pressures.\n\nEarlier this year, Nigeria and China renewed their bilateral currency swap deal valued at 15 billion yuan (3.19 trillion), three years after the initial agreement expired.\n\nThe Peoples Bank of China said the renewed three-year pact aims to promote bilateral trade and investment facilitation.\n\nIn Angola, a key oil supplier to China, the yuan is increasingly being used in energy and infrastructure transactions, with the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), Chinas alternative to SWIFT, being integrated into the financial system.\n\nLauren Johnston, a senior research fellow at the AustChina Institute and China-Africa expert, told the South China Morning Post that Africa offers a strategic testbed for Beijings currency goals.\n\nAfrica is a continent where trade with China is important, but it is also one where many countries struggle to access sufficient foreign currencies such as the euro or US dollar, she noted.\n\nJohnston added, For China, there may be a chance to test the internationalisation of the RMB via a few countries in Africa first, where volumes might be small on a global scale and Chinas footprint in the region relatively large.\n\nThese efforts mark a broader rebalancing of global financial influence, with China positioning the yuan as a viable alternative in Africas evolving economic landscape.\n\n",
