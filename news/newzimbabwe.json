            "content": "Channel Africa\n\nZimbabwes attempt to reckon with one of its darkest chapters, the Gukurahundi massacres of the 1980s, is drawing fierce criticism, with questions raised about the legitimacy of the process under President Emmerson Mnangagwas leadership.\n\nThe government says it is moving forward with a judicial and reconciliation programme aimed at addressing long-standing grievances stemming from the mass killings in Matabeleland and the Midlands, which left an estimated 20 000 people dead. But for many survivors and human rights advocates, the effort feels hollow, not least because of who is leading it.\n\nAt the time of the atrocities, Mnangagwa was the Minister of State for National Security, serving under then-President Robert Mugabe. His involvement in the security structures responsible for the crackdown has cast a long shadow over the current initiative.\n\nGeopolitical analyst Aaron Ngambi believes the process is more about optics than accountability.Mnangagwa seems determined to close this chapter, but many view it as an attempt to whitewash the past, Ngambi said in an interview. Its difficult to talk about reconciliation when those accused of complicity are in charge of the process.\n\nThe Gukurahundi killings, carried out by the North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade, targeted members of the Ndebele ethnic group in the aftermath of Zimbabwes independence. The violence has never been properly investigated, and the state has long resisted calls for justice and recognition.\n\nNow, with the renewed focus on the issue, some observers say the timing may be politically motivated, part of a broader effort by Mnangagwa to shape his legacy and consolidate power in the run-up to future elections.\n\nAny reconciliation process that fails to include survivors, civil society and independent investigators will never be seen as credible, Ngambi warned. This moment demands openness, not control.\n\n",

I am consulting. I am building. I am assembling a new strategy and a citizens team that will carry and pivot this nation unto greatness and stardom, Chamisa wrote on his X account, Thursday.\n\nHe described his departure from the CCC as disembarking from a ship that was leaking and could have jeopardised the democratic project he is striving to realise in Zimbabwe.\n\nI left CCC but not the mission. All because CCC was never the destination. It was just the vehicle meant to take us to the New Zimbabwe. When that vehicle was compromised, it became necessary to step out and prepare a better, cleaner, fit-for-purpose vehicle, he explained.\n\nChamisa further acknowledged the mistakes he made during his time at the helm of the CCC.\n\nOur approach in 2023 was not the same as 2018, because in the fight against oppression, no strategy is cast in stone. This is a battle to save lives and to save a nation. We sometimes miss. We sometimes omit. We commit. We adjust. We correct. We keep moving forward until we win.
