Most of the purveyors of this succession issue are known not to be members of Zanu PF; they are known not to be within the structures of Zanu PF.\n\nAs Zanu PF, we will not allow a conversation to be imported into the party. We are going to a conference to check on the mandate which we received from the people in 2023.\n\nAlthough party slogans declaring that Mnangagwa will be in power up until 2030 appear to have been silenced, at provincial, district or cell meetings, they continue being chanted, even in the presence of party bigwigs such as Kazembe Kazembe and Owen Ncube in the Midlands Province.\n\nRecent Politburo meetings have been nothing short of explosive, with Chiwenga standing up to Mnangagwa and bringing dossiers to nail his allies and fear abounds that their tussle could result in another coup.\n\nChiwenga, then Commander of Zimbabwes military, led the 2017 coup that installed Mnangagwa as state leader. Although his influence in the army might have been diluted by his decision to join politics, there is fear that he has a lot of sympathisers within its ranks.\n\nMnangagwa has most of Zimbabwes cash-rich individuals, all of whom would be ready to defend his stay to protect their interests.\n\nAdded Marapira: The relationship between the President and his two Vice Presidents is friendly.\n\nAll this talk of animosity, hatred and fighting is a narrow agenda by other parties hoping to bring alarm and despondency within our rank and file.\n\n",

The first and second respondents (Labenmon Investments and the director Daniel Mlalazi) and are hereby found to be in contempt of this courts provisional order issued under Case Number HCCC15/25.\n\nShe further directed that the respondents are hereby ordered to immediately stop all works at the Wih-Zim Construction Material Investments Cement Manufacturing plant in Magunje, Hurungwe until the matter under HCCC15/25 is finalised.\n\nThe first respondent was fined US$3,000 payable within one month, while Mlalazi was sentenced to 30 days imprisonment, wholly suspended on condition that the company complies with the court order.\n\nMuzofas ruling comes after villagers from Kapere and Chasara under Ward 11 in Hurungwe, represented by Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) lawyers Tinashe Chinopfukutwa and Kelvin Kabaya, challenged the setting up of the cement plant, saying it was encroaching on their grazing and farming land.\n\nAccording to the villagers, the Chinese firm Labenmon Investments, which is linked to Wih-Zim, arrived in July 2024 and began fencing off the land without consultation.\n\nThe villagers later learnt that Labenmon Investments was going to establish a cement manufacturing plant on the pegged area, and they were prohibited from accessing their grazing fields and farming land, ZLHR said in a statement.\n\nThe lawyers argued that the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) erred in law by issuing an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) certificate to Labenmon Investments without receiving or properly evaluating the companys EIA report  a violation of sections 100(1) and 100(2) of the Environmental Management Act.\n\nThe Director-General of EMA violated the principles of natural justice as espoused in section 136 by failing to consult the appellants who are affected by the proposed cement manufacturing plant and giving them an opportunity to be heard, the lawyers said.\n\nThey further contended that the Director-General of EMA failed to exercise his powers by not inviting the developers and affected villagers to a consultative meeting as required by law.\n\nAbout 23 families are reportedly affected by the project, which has sparked outrage in the rural community for displacing farmers and cutting off access to communal grazing land.\n\n",

Local silence allows rivers to turn into sludge. The Chinese did not corrupt our system, they found it already for sale, Chasi wrote.\n\nThe former energy minister argued that environmental destruction in Zimbabwe reflects a broader governance crisis rather than foreign exploitation alone.\n\nThis isnt a Chinese problem. It is a governance problem. If rules can be bought, someones selling, he added.\n\nEvery destroyed riverbed tells a local story, a signature, a bribe, a blind eye. Foreign miners only exploit the vacuum we created.\n\nBlaming outsiders has become a fashionable, convenient self-deception. Environmental destruction thrives because enforcement is selective and oversight compromised, Chasi wrote.\n\nThe reform we need is not about nationality; it is about integrity.\n\nUntil our institutions stop trading ecological integrity for quick cash, nothing will change. The Chinese did not destroy our mountains and rivers. Our signatures did, he added.\n\n",
