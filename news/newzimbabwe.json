In a Tuesday announcement, Meta said it was also rolling new tools on WhatsApp to help people spot scams  including a new safety overview that the platform will show when someone who is not in a users contacts adds them to a group, as well as ongoing test alerts to pause before responding.\n\nScams arebecoming all too commonand increasingly sophisticated in todays digital world  withtoo-good-to-be-trueoffers and unsolicited messages attempting to steal consumers information or money filling our phones, social media and other corners of the internet each day. Meta noted that some of the most prolific sources of scams are criminal scam centers, which oftenspan from forced laboroperated by organized crime  and warned that such efforts often target people on many platforms at once, in attempts to evade detection.\n\nThat means that a scam campaign may start with messages over text or a dating app, for example, and then move to social media and payment platforms, the California-based company said.\n\npointed to recent scam efforts that it said attempted to use its own apps  as well as TikTok, Telegram and AI-generated messages made using ChatGPT  to offer payments for fake likes, enlist people into a pyramid scheme and/or lure others into cryptocurrency investments.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has ended a protracted deadlock between Powertel Communications (Pvt) Ltd and Dandemutande Investments (Pvt) Ltd by ordering the appointment of a sole arbitrator to preside over their long-running contractual dispute, after nearly seven years of failed arbitration efforts.\n\nIn a ruling delivered by Justice Maxwell Takuva, the court criticised Dandemutande for obstructing the arbitration process and held that Powertel had met the legal requirements to invoke the High Courts intervention under Article 11(4) of the Arbitration Act [Chapter 7:15].\n\nThe applicant still yearns for redress and their agreement provides that unless the parties agree to the jurisdiction of the courts, their dispute shall be resolved through the arbitration process. However, without agreeing on the appointment of the arbitrator, the dispute remains unresolved, noted the judge.\n\nThe dispute arose from a 2010 Internet Capacity Purchase Agreement between the two telecoms companies.\n\nClause 27 of the agreement required that all disputes be referred to arbitration, unless the parties consented to the jurisdiction of Zimbabwean courts.\n\nA rift emerged in 2017 after Dandemutande terminated the agreement and allegedly failed to pay a debt of over US$2.29 million claimed by Powertel.\n\nThe parties initially agreed to appoint retired Justice Vernanda Ziyambi as arbitrator in 2018, but the arbitration never materialised because Dandemutande, the claimant at the time, failed to file its claim.\n\nJustice Ziyambi later withdrew from the process due to unavailability.\n\nIn 2023, Powertel approached the Commercial Arbitration Centre seeking a new arbitrator, leading to the appointment of Dr. Whatman.\n\nHowever, Dandemutande objected, and the arbitrator ruled that the matter was improperly before him and terminated proceedings by consent.\n\nPowertel then turned to the High Court for relief.\n\nDandemutande opposed the application, raising two preliminary points  that the claim had prescribed and that the relief sought was incompetent.\n\nOn prescription, the court found that no actual claim had been filed before it, only an application for appointment of an arbitrator.\n\nThe preliminary point on prescription lacks merit, Takuva held.\n\nSuch a point could only be raised before the forum dealing with the applicants claim.\n\nThe court also dismissed the second objection, ruling that while Powertel had proposed the Chairman of the Commercial Arbitration Centre to recommend an arbitrator, that proposal did not usurp the courts discretion.\n\nThe relief sought is incompetent because it takes away the discretion of the Court in appointing an arbitrator, said the judge.\n\nHowever, this does not prejudice the respondent in any way The Court retains the discretion on who to appoint.\n\nThe court was further scathing of Dandemutandes silence in the face of multiple attempts by Powertel to restart arbitration.\n\nIn my view, by so doing the respondent was not being fair to the applicant, said Justice Takuva. Whatever its reasons, it should have at least communicated its reasons The respondents non-cooperation in appointing an arbitrator was deliberate and has forced the applicant to institute litigation.\n\nHe then ruled in favour of Powertel and authorised the Chairman of the Commercial Arbitration Centre to appoint a sole arbitrator on behalf of the court.\n\nHowever, it declined Powertels request for punitive costs, finding that although Dandemutande had delayed the process, Powertel had also contributed to the delay by waiting five years to revive arbitration after the first attempt failed.\n\nAn order for costs on the ordinary scale will suffice, Justice Takuva concluded.\n\nTakuva ruled that the application for appointment of an arbitrator is granted.\n\nHe said the Chairman of the Commercial Arbitration Centre in Harare is authorised to appoint a suitable arbitrator on behalf of the court.\n\nDandemutande shall pay Powertels costs on the ordinary scale.\n\nThe ruling is expected to restart formal proceedings between the two parties and finally bring closure to one of the telecommunications industrys longest-running contractual disputes.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/another-zimbabwe-gold-coin-sale-registers-little-for-most/",
            "content": "This article was originally published byGlobal Press Journal.\n\nByGamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  With the price of gold up globally, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe in April put the gold coins it stopped minting a year earlier back on the market.\n\nBut interested investors had to act fast.\n\nBy mid-June, the sale of coins from its accumulated stock was abruptly concluded and another chapter of the currency chaos that has characterized the nations economy for decades was in the books. This time, at least, economists say the experiment had little effect.\n\nThe short-lived sale is just the latest example in a long line of inconsistent policies, says Ithiel Mavesere, a lecturer in the economics and development department at the University of Zimbabwe. Storing value in a gold coin is not a viable option for the majority of the population, he adds.\n\nIdeally, what they should have done is come up with low-value coins, with denominations as low as equivalent to US$20 for the majority of the population to afford, Mavesere says.\n\nHowever, Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Governor John Mushayavanhu says in a written response to Global Press Journal that the gold coins were effective as an alternative investment instrument and there was huge demand from both corporations and individuals. According to RBZ data, corporations bought about 79% of the gold coins and individuals bought about 21%.\n\nThe lowest denomination of the coins represents a tenth of an ounce of gold, equivalent to 9,299.13 in Zimbabwe gold, or ZiG, the national currency, or about US$347. The highest denomination of the coins represents one ounce of gold, equivalent to ZiG 92,991.34 or about US$3,470.\n\nIn all, the central bank has sold gold coins worth ZiG 343 million, or about US$12.8 million, according to Mushayavanhu, who says the recent sale happened after the bank noted increased demand following the rise in international gold prices.\n\nIn this context, the Reserve Bank re-issued an accumulated parcel of gold coins from a combination of gold coins which had been bought back from the market through redemptions and some coins which were still being held at the Reserve Bank from the previously minted stock, the governor wrote.\n\nA statement from the bank in mid-June announcing the halt to the sale indicated it had been intended to clear the stock of gold coins it had and those that had been cashed in by their holders.\n\nMushayavanhu says the bank stopped minting gold coins in April 2024 to prioritize its gold reserve which, along with foreign currency reserves, backs the Zimbabwe gold currency.\n\nHe says foreign reserves increased from US$270 million in April 2024 to US$731 million as of the end of June.\n\nThe central bank first introduced the Mosi-oa-Tunya gold coins  which share an indigenous name for Victoria Falls  in 2022 at a time when the country was experiencing currency instability with high inflation and continued devaluation of what was then the national currency, the Zimbabwe dollar.\n\nThe coins aimed to reduce dependency on the US dollar and help stabilize the economy. The coins helped mop up excess cash in local currency that was circulating in the market. Coupled with other monetary measures in 2022, the monthly inflation rate dropped from about 31% in June to about 12% in August that year.\n\nHowever, the exchange rate of the Zimbabwe dollar drastically fell against the US dollar and the government replaced it with the newZimbabwe gold currencyin April 2024. Since its introduction, the currencys value has been cut in half.\n\nLyle Begbie, an economist with Oxford Economics Africa, believes the sale of the gold coins when they were introduced in 2022 was more of a revenue-generating scheme, as it happened at a time when inflation was very high.\n\nHe says it makes sense that the recent sale of gold coins was influenced by the increase in gold prices on the global market. But he adds that the value of gold coins was too little to have an impact on the economy. Begbie says the US$12.8 million in coins the central bank reported selling is less than 1% of Zimbabwes gross domestic product  which the World Bank estimates at US$44 billion  a drop in the ocean when it comes to the countrys macroeconomic picture.\n\nProsper Chitambara, an economist based in Harare, agrees the impact of the recent sale was minimal. He says gold coins dont have a significant impact on currency stability in an economy like Zimbabwes, which is highly informal and also highly dollarized  meaning its heavily reliant on the US dollar as a currency.\n\nMost economic agents in our economy prefer to transact using their US dollars because its a highly tradable and highly liquid asset.  So theres a huge confidence and trust in the USD than in the gold coins or even in the Zimbabwe gold, Chitambara says.\n\nSamuel Wadzai, the executive director of Vendors Initiative for Social and Economic Transformation, an organization in Harare that advocates for the informal business sector, says there have been a few instances where members have tried to use gold coins for everyday transactions, but it hasnt been widespread.\n\nMost traders still prefer cash due to the challenges of acceptance and the limited understanding of gold coins in everyday trade, he says.\n\nIsheanesu Kwenda sets up his clothing stall along Park Street in Harare. Like many in Zimbabwes vast informal economy, the street vendor says he has never bought gold coins and prefers to store value in US dollars. Photo Credit: Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nIsheanesu Kwenda, 31, a Harare street vendor with a sociology degree, says the recent sale of gold coins didnt offer any benefit for him. Like many Zimbabweans, he has heard about the gold coins, but has never seen or opted to buy them. The vendor is part of Zimbabwes informal economy, which sustains over 80% of Zimbabwes population and contributes nearly 72% to the countrys GDP.\n\nStreet economics informs that you should not attempt to get something you are not sure of or do not understand.  I prefer to sell my goods and keep my money in US dollars because it holds value, or I can keep my money in stock, Kwenda says of the clothing he sells.\n\nLast year, Kwenda lost more than half his earnings after Zimbabwe gold was introduced. After being paid the equivalent of US$1,000 in Zimbabwe dollars, he only managed to salvage US$360 and lost the rest in exchange rate losses.\n\nFor Kwenda, restoring confidence is simple: The government must stick to a plan, without making sudden U-turns.\n\nGamuchirai Masiyiwais a Reporter-in-Residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.
