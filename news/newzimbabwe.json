He had travelled to meet with civil society organisations (CSOs) to discuss rights violations and to offer solidarity.\n\nCiZC described Vavas deportation as a barbaric act of repression.\n\nIn a statement, CiZC condemned the treatment of its director, describing it as an attack to human rights.\n\nWe are disturbed by the continued harassment and deportations of human rights defenders and election observers whose work is not criminal but aimed at promoting human rights, good governance and democracy, the statement read.\n\nCiZC criticised President Samia Suluhu Hassan and her regime for trampling on the values of ubuntu and pan-Africanism that the countrys founding president, Julius Nyerere, stood for.\n\nVava reportedly arrived at Julius Nyerere International Airport in Dar es Salaam on 28 October as part of a regional solidarity mission to engage with CSOs and social movements. The mission aimed to discuss concerns over the escalating crackdown on dissent under what the coalition called the increasingly authoritarian regime which has also shut down the internet.\n\nUpon arrival, Vavas passport was reportedly confiscated by immigration officials, who subjected him to hours of interrogation and profiling in restricted airport rooms. He was later informed that he was not welcome in Tanzania and labelled a security risk-without any formal explanation.\n\nThe coalition said Vava spent the night detained in a holding cell at the airport without blankets before being deported on 29 October.\n\nTanzanian officials have remained mum on the incident.\n\n",

That being the case, she certainly has the interests of her husband. We know the interests. We know how eager he is to become the president of the country; in so doing, she will serve the interests of her husband and not the country, said Mliswa.\n\nMliswas tirade against her follows an embarrassing power outage at the new Parliament Building, which forced President Emmerson Mnangagwa to complete his State of the Nation Address (SONA) using torchlight.\n\nMliswa says the hiccup was not a coincidence but sabotage against Mnangagwa.\n\nThe former Norton legislator accuses Miniyothabo of establishing a parallel structure within the military ranks.\n\nShe is running a parallel structure and it is important that the President knows. My expos of my passport and my boarding card, which was done on social media by Ali Naka, came through her. She has been doing that. What is also important is that the commander of MID certainly does not tolerate her. In not tolerating her, she is able to run a parallel structure. You can not have a parallel structure from a security perspective, he said.\n\nDespite being a colonel in the army, Miniyothabo has become a darling of the public and has never publicly declared any political ambitions.\n\nThe attack by Mliswa also comes as factionalism is deepening in ZANU PF over the succession of Mnangagwa, whose term of office expires in 2028. His loyalists are campaigning for an extended term of office by two years, until 2030.\n\nAdded Mliswa,I had already suggested and proposed that she can not be in office, being the wife of the Vice President, because she is already compromised. When people see her, they see the Vice President. How do you expect them not to take instructions from her? If you do not take instructions from her, you are fired. Why is it taking so long to retire her?\n\nThis is very important and for as long as this is not attended to, these issues will continue. There is a parallel structure which is being run from a security perspective.\n\n",

            "content": "Farmers Weekly\n\nBorn and bred in Zimbabwe, 68-year-old farmer Stuart Brentwas evicted from Kilvington Farm in Norton, just outside Harare, in September 2002.\n\nIn April this year, local media reported that the government had started paying white farmers compensation for the land grabs that occurred under the so-called Fast-track Land Reform Programme (FTLRP).\n\nIt reported thatinvestors whose farms were protected under Bilateral Investment Promotion and Protection Agreements (BIPPAs) would be compensated for land and improvements, while those who lost land through the FTLRP would be compensated for improvements only.\n\nThe Valuation Consortium (Valcon), a Zimbabwean valuation company, and the governments Land Compensation Committee came up with a valuation figure of US$5,2 billion (R90 billion) for improvements on farms.\n\nAccording to the Compensation Steering Committee (CSC), the Commercial Farmers Union came up with a compensation figure of US$10 billion (R174 billion), while independent professional valuers settled for US$8,5 billion (R148 billion). Both figures included the value of land, which was US$3,2 billion (R56 billion).\n\nAfter lengthy negotiations, the government adjusted its figure to US$3,5 billion (R61 billion), a figure that is currently operational.\n\nBrent said that initially, improvements on his farm were valued at US$1,6 million (R28 million), but as the government was opposed to paying that amount, negotiations saw the payment reduced to US$800000 (R14 million).\n\nHe said he had bought the farm in 1990 after getting a certificate from the government that it had no interest in that property, hence he could purchase it. He then took a loan from Standard Chartered Bank that he repaid over five years.\n\nBrent moved to Nigeria in 2009 with the hope of starting commercial farming there, but the expedition turned into a terrible flop due to a lack of promised finance and backing from the Nigerian government.\n\nI left Nigeria after living in tents in the middle of the bush for a year, he explained.\n\nHe added that no amount of compensation would ever make up for the suffering he endured due to the loss of his home, business, and his only profession, farming.When he returned to Zimbabwe, he lived off savings and gratuity payments.\n\nHe said he used to grow tobacco, maize, Rhodes grass seed for export, had cattle, and had just started an ostrich project when he was evicted from his land. Brent nowlives in a retirement home near Harare with his 65-year-old wife.\n\nDeon Theron, a farmer who rejected the compensation deal, said most dispossessed farmers decided not to sign up for compensation because the deal violated the countrys laws that stated payment should be fair and paid within a reasonable time.\n\nTheron, a CSC member, said the deal was discriminatory. He explained that Zimbabwean citizens, considered indigenous and foreigners, covered under BIPPA were paid the full price in cash for the land and improvements. However, citizens not deemed indigenous were treated differently.\n\nThe way forward is to talk to the international community and the government of Zimbabwe to find a way forward of financing fair compensation for everyone. This is possible, and we are busy talking to the government and various embassies and international financial institutions, he added.\n\nTheron said that after 1980, over a period of 37 years, he managed to buy three farms through loans from the Agricultural Finance Corporation.\n\nI lost my third farm with everything on it through violence in 2000. It is now settled with hundreds of A1 settlers.\n\nI lost my second farm in 2004 and my first farm in 2008. It was my main farm where we lived, and it was a dairy farm I built from scratch, he said.\n\nWhen I visited the farm a few years ago, there was very little going on. I saw a few goats and about seven people hanging around.\n\nAccording to Theron, about 90% of acquired farms were valued by Valcon, and the valuation exercise was largely funded by the EU.\n\nHe said the law required that people be paid within a reasonable time and stipulated that interest should be paid if compensation was delayed, yet he had not received a cent in more than two decades.\n\nThe question remains: why am I being discriminated against as a born-and-bred Zimbabwean when foreigners are treated differently? I am being discriminated against because of the colour of my skin.\n\nOur constitution does not allow discrimination against any race, he added.\n\nA liberation war was fought to end racial discrimination. Now we are back to doing exactly what that was opposed.\n\nAnthony Purkis, director of Valcon, said that when it became cleararound 2002 that farm expropriations were a reality, most farmers wanted valuations before they lost their properties.\n\nHe added that the only way to meet the demand was to employ mass valuation methods, which led to the formation of the farmdatabase.\n\nPurkis said it wasnt until 2017 when then-president Robert Mugabe lost power to Emmerson Mnangagwa that real communication started between Valcon and the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development; the Ministry of Finance; and other government departments.\n\nIn July 2020, the government signed an agreement called the Global Compensation Deed (GCD) with farmers, Valcon, and other stakeholders, based on the US$3,5 billion (R61 billion) payout.\n\nPurkis said the GCD promiseda 50% down payment 12 months after acceptance of the deed, followed by 12,5% in each of the subsequent four years.\n\nHe added that the farmers did not receive any payment within the set time frame, and the government came up with another offer,the Farmers Compensation Agreement (FCA), in 2023.\n\nThe [FCA] is a 10-year deal with a mix of small amounts of cash and Treasury bills/bonds. Approximately 1 000 applications have been accepted for the FCA, and 631 of those have received a 1% cash payment to various bank accounts here or in other countries in US dollars. That is the 1% allocated in the agreement of the value of the improvements only.\n\nThe Land Acquisition Act and the Constitution make it quite clear that land will not be compensated by this country, only improvements to the land, which include buildings, roads, fencing, irrigation, and so on.\n\nThe remainder of the compensation is to be paid in Treasury bonds over 10 years, maturing yearly with2% interest on outstanding value, he explained.\n\nPurkis said thecompensation figure for improvements was initially recordedas US$5,2 billion (R90 billion) but was deemed unaffordable by the government and reduced through bargaining to US$3,5 billion (R61 billion), which most farmers reluctantly accepted and was still the accepted FCA figure.\n\nHe added that the Valcon database included over 90% of all commercial farms registered for compensation. Although it recorded 4700 farms, they were owned by just 2450 farmers, highlighting that some farmers owned more than one farm.\n\n",

We have the strategy, we have the evidence, and we have the dedicated workforce. What we need now is the collective will to convert our commitments into concrete action. We must find the missing cases, secure the necessary resources and embrace the innovations that will allow us to end TB in Zimbabwe, Mugurungi said.\n\nSpeaking at the same event, Zimbabwean Health and Child Care Minister Douglas Mombeshora commended Zimbabwe for progress in the fight against the infectious disease.\n\nOur TB response has made real progress.

He did not say when the restrictions will be lifted.\n\nDar es Salaam Regional Commissioner Alfred Chalamila had earlier warned that the government would take strong action against those disrupting peace in the city.\n\nDemonstrations were also reported in the south-western city of Mbeya and the border town of Tunduma.\n\nWe are tired We want an independent electoral commission so that every Tanzanian can choose the leader they want, a protester told the BBC.\n\nAlong with the unrest of the streets, internet connectivity across the country has been severely disrupted.
