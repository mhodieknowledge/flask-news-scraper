Each was granted bail of R5,000.\n\nTheir two co-accused, Livhuwani Mutavhatsindi, 27, and Perfious Chauke, 27, were remanded in custody without bail. The Zimbabwean nationals also face charges under the Immigration Act.\n\nMalabi-Dzhangi said the group faces charges of possession of illicit cigarettes, possession of ammunition, and defeating the ends of justice.\n\nThe arrests on September 16, 2025, followed an incident at the Artonvilla military base, where the SANDF members allegedly intercepted a group of smugglers transporting 24 master boxes of illicit Remington Gold cigarettes, valued at an estimated R300,000.\n\nIt is alleged that the soldiers only declared 18 of the boxes to SA Revenue Service Customs, while the remaining six boxes were later found hidden under their beds.\n\nPolice were alerted to the discrepancy and, upon searching the premises, found six master boxes of Remington Gold cigarettes concealed under the SANDF members beds. Two civilians were also discovered hiding at the base. The accused were immediately arrested, said Malabi-Dzhangi.\n\nOn the other hand, the SANDF has confirmed that the operation was unauthorized and has reiterated its zero-tolerance stance on corruption, with disciplinary processes to run concurrently with the criminal proceedings.\n\nPreliminary reports indicate that, at approximately midnight on 16 September 2025, a group of SANDF members allegedly conducted an unauthorised operation at Artonvilla, Musina (also known as Sediba sa Tlou base). It is alleged that the members, acting in concert with two Zimbabwean nationals, attempted to unlawfully intercept a group of smugglers transporting illicit cigarettes into South Africa, said SANDF spokesperson, Rear Admiral Prince Tshabalala.\n\nDuring the incident, shots were reportedly fired, illicit goods were seized, and some contraband was unlawfully concealed at the base.\n\nFollowing credible intelligence, the SANDF military police, military intelligence, and the SAPS launched a joint operation later that morning.\n\nThe case has been adjourned until November 14, 2025, for further investigation.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nThe Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) have announced a dramatic venue change, in an unexpected twist in the lead-up to the 2026 FIFA World Cup qualifiers next month.\n\nTheir pivotal clash against South Africas Bafana Bafana, originally slated for South African soil, will now take place at the Obed Itani Chilume Stadium in Francistown, Botswana, on October 10, 2025.\n\nThis decision comes about because Zimbabwe have issues with hosting international matches at home due to a FIFA ban stemming from stadium concerns.\n\nZimbabwe have previously held their home qualifiers in South Africa, specifically utilising popular venues such as Orlando Stadium. The transition to Botswana is seen as a move to create a more logistical and fan-friendly environment for their supporters.\n\nLocal sources from the Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa) report that the decision aims to make the match more accessible for both the Warriors fans. The move is significant as the fixture serves as a milestone in South Africas quest for World Cup qualification.\n\nAs it stands, South Africa leads the standings in Group C with 17 points from eight matches, putting them in pole position for qualification. Meanwhile, Zimbabwe languishes at the bottom with only four points, a stark reflection of their struggleshaving won merely two of their last 27 qualifiers since 2010.\n\nThis latest venue change adds further intrigue to a match that, while less critical for Zimbabwes aspirations, could serve as a defining moment for a Bafana squad looking to solidify their World Cup journey.\n\nThe Obed Itani Chilume Stadium, which boasts a capacity of 26,000, has been recognised as a reliable venue, previously hosting Namibia during their World Cup qualifiers, thus demonstrating its capability to cater to international football standards.\n\nThis choice of location not only provides a neutral ground but also enhances accessibility for Zimbabwean fans, who usually faced no challenges attending matches in South Africa.\n\nDespite Zimbabwes elimination from World Cup contention following a disappointing series of resultsincluding losses to Benin and Rwandathis encounter with the Bafana is unlikely to diminish local interest. Providing a stage to showcase talent, the upcoming match may serve more as a platform for national pride and a precursor to the upcoming 2025 Africa Cup of Nations.\n\nHowever, the venue shift has left many fans puzzled; while the location changes, Zimbabwes hopeless position in the qualifiers is still unchanged. The decision ultimately raises questions about ZIFAs administrative strategy, especially as Zimbabwe prepares to face South Africa, Nigeria, and Lesotho, a task that seems more metaphorical than consequential.\n\nThe president of the Botswana Football Association, Tariq Babitseng, confirmed the hosting arrangement, emphasising the significance of this contest for Bafana as they aim for a win to bolster their World Cup bid.\n\nWith anticipation building, all eyes will be on Francistown this October, regardless of the unpredictable journey Zimbabwes Warriors have faced in their World Cup qualifiers.\n\n",

It is designed to facilitate partnerships for technical support, tributary agreements, joint ventures, debt funding, or even the outright sale of mining claims.\n\nAccording to ZIDA, the service is open to all mining claim holders in Zimbabwe, whether individuals, companies, or syndicates, regardless of their scale of operation.\n\nTo use the platform, claim holders are required to upload their identification documents, claim registration certificate, valid inspection certificate, and a site map.\n\nBut speaking during a plenary discussion at the 2025 Environmental Social Governance Conference convened by the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Organisation (ZELO) and Silveira House on the sidelines of the Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba in Bulawayo, the ZIDA Legal Manager, Chidochashe Ncube, said local miners were not tapping into the platforms potential.\n\nThere seems to be a lack of trust by locals who suspect the risk of losing their claims. Locals want to go behind the scenes and the few who come forth only do after being shortchanged by the potential investors.\n\nThe public must be aware that this platform has a number of benefits like assistance in identifying ethical investors, contract drafting and professional advice on business-related issues, she said.\n\nNcube said such platforms also enhance the strengthening of ESG standards since matched parties easily fall under the authorities surveillance.\n\nQuizzed by one David Bote on why ZIDA appears to be pro-foreign investors as opposed to locals in rendering assistance, Ncube dismissed the claims, arguing that locals are not willing to come forth and exhaust available opportunities.\n\nIt is incorrect. The fact of the matter is that foreigners first port of call is usually the ZIDA because they do not know anyone around. In contras,t locals often bypass the Agency, opting to engage their connections instead, only to look for us when this goes off hand, added Ncube.\n\n",

Mnangagwa is serving his second and final constitutional term, ending in 2028, though his allies have been lobbying for the postponement of elections to 2030.\n\nAt last years National Peoples Conference in Bulawayo, Zanu PF passed a resolution to extend Mnangagwas tenure until 2030 or beyond. The move, however, met resistance from rival factions within the party and war veterans believed to be backing Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, widely tipped as Mnangagwas likely successor.\n\nAddressing the Central Committee this Thursday, Mnangagwa hinted that the upcoming Mutare conference would be crucial in setting the partys direction, with the thorny succession question expected to dominate discussions.\n\nWe gather today, a few weeks before we hold the 22nd National Peoples Conference in the scenic City of Mutare, Manicaland Province.\n\nFurther, this meeting is being convened at a time when we have passed the halfway mark since our last Harmonised General Elections in 2023.\n\nIt is, therefore, of critical importance that we introspect as a Party, not only with regards to our short-term activities, but also in view of the bigger objective of ensuring that our party resoundingly wins the 2028 Harmonised General Elections, said Mnangagwa.\n\nTensions remain high within Zanu PF over the succession race. Business tycoon Kudakwashe Tagwirei, recently co-opted into the Central Committee, is reportedly eyeing the presidency, while Chiwenga is believed to command strong support from within party structures.\n\nMnangagwa urged members to stay grounded in the partys founding ethos while remaining focused on Vision 2030.\n\nLet us, as the leadership, continually align the membership of the Party to the founding ideology, values, principles and the overall provisions of the Party Constitution.\n\nThe wheels of our revolution should be kept moving, our grassroots membership and structures well-organised, mobilised and informed.\n\nAll of us must work harder, with determination and focus across all sectors, as we accelerate the realisation of Vision 2030, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, in Parliament on Wednesday, opposition MPs pressed government to clarify its position on implementing reforms outlined in the 2023 SADC Election Observer Report, recommendations critical ahead of future polls.\n\n",

Instead of creating a limited-access account as requested by a United Nations consultant working on the project, they allegedly built a hidden account with full administrative rights.\n\nUsing this backdoor, they manipulated clearing agents prepayment accounts, inserting fictitious deposits to make it appear as if customs duties had been paid. In reality, no money was received by ZIMRA. \n\nThe agents were then able to clear goods duty-free while the accused allegedly collected cash from them, sharing the proceeds.\n\nThe scam ran undetected for months, with prosecutors telling the court that by abusing their positions, the accused acted contrary to their duties as public officers, showing favour to themselves and prejudice to ZIMRA.\n\nNothing has been recovered from the multi-million-dollar fraud.\n\nThe two were remanded in custody pending finalisation of their bail hearing.\n\n",

Integrity, discipline and unity, concern for the people and clean governance must be synonymous with Zanu PF.\n\nAs provided for in our Party Constitution, we have a duty to boldly and decisively deal with those who put the name of the Party into disrepute. Winning the hearts and minds of our people remains a critical role of every cadre and structure of the Party, Mnangagwa said.\n\nHe also warned against the abuse of empowerment facilities designed to benefit grassroots communities, citing the recently launched Presidential Womens League Empowerment Fund as an example.\n\nRecently, I launched the Presidential Womens League Empowerment Fund to facilitate the expansion and diversification of various income-generating projects being implemented by women.\n\nAbuse of these facilities will not be accepted. We are a Party that honours the grassroots. We must maintain our character as an inclusive, fair and people-centred Party, he added.\n\nDespite the government rolling out various youth and womens empowerment programmes, critics argue that most of these facilities rarely reach the intended beneficiaries, particularly young people struggling to break into the formal economy.\n\n",
