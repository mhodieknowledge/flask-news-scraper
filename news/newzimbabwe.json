            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA retired pastor who tried to evade repaying a US$22,750 loan by falsely claiming illiteracy has lost his case at the High Court, which ordered him to settle the debt and declared his Budiriro house executable.\n\nJudges of appeal Justices Hapias Zhou and Benjamin Chikowero ruled that Pastor Stefan Pios Mumbiro knowingly signed all loan and mortgage documents binding him to businessman Collins Farai Muchada, but later attempted to take advantage of his supposed illiteracy to escape liability.\n\nThe first respondent was not illiterate. He was educated up to Grade 7, could read and write, and even successfully undertook pastoral studies, the judges said. He cannot evade responsibility by pretending not to understand what he signed.\n\nThe court condemned Mumbiros conduct, saying he had taken advantage of Muchadas trust while later seeking to hide behind claims of being duped.\n\nEvidence before the court showed that Mumbiro willingly signed an Acknowledgement of Debt, a Power of Attorney to register a Mortgage Bond, and other loan documents, all of which were verified by a handwriting expert.\n\nThe only credible evidence on record was that adduced by the appellant himself, amply corroborated by the Questioned Document Examiner, the Acknowledgement of Debt, the Power of Attorney to Pass Mortgage Bond, the Mortgage Bond, and the Forensic Examination Report, Chikowero said.\n\nThe court said Mumbiros story fell apart under cross-examination when he admitted signing blank papers, a move the judges described as a deliberate attempt to distort facts and mislead the court.\n\nCiting the long-standing legal principle of caveat subscriptor, the bench reminded litigants that a party to a contract is bound by his signature, whether or not he has read or understood the document.\n\nChikowero criticised the lower court for allowing Mumbiro to eat his cake and still have it by accepting contradictory statements about how much he borrowed.\n\nAs a result, the High Court ordered Mumbiro to repay US$22,750 plus interest and costs, and ruled that his Budiriro home, Stand 2308 of Willowvale Estate, be declared specially executable should he fail to pay.\n\nIn their judgment, the judges issued a clear warning to others attempting similar deceit.\n\nThe loud and clear message to go out from the court is: businessmen beware. If you fail to honour your contracts, dont start crying when the other party obtains an order compelling you to perform.\n\nMumbiro had earlier accused Muchada of being a fraudster who wants to con me of my house, but the judges found no proof of that claim.\n\nThe case originated at the Harare Magistrates Court, where Mumbiro initially won after convincing the magistrate that he was illiterate and had been duped. However, the High Court overturned that decision, ruling that Mumbiro had instead abused the courts sympathy and his position as a retired pastor to avoid his legal obligations.\n\n",

He will, therefore, spend an effective 30 months behind bars.\n\nThe State case was that between June 3 and 13, 2025, the offender confiscated a drivers certificate of competency from Olly Mcupi at a roadblock along the Karoi-Nyamambizi road and demanded US$50 for its release.\n\nCourt heard that following a complaint by Mcupis father, Sebastian Kumbirai Chinyemba, a special team from Police General Headquarters (PGHQ) set up a sting operation.\n\nWith instructions from the PGHQ team, Mcupi arranged to meet the rogue cop at TM Supermarket, Karoi, where Dzimbanhete handed back the confiscated certificate in exchange for cash while seated in a Toyota Gaia.\n\nThe police internal investigations team moved in immediatelycapturing the transaction on video. In a dramatic twist, Dzimbanhete swallowed the marked US$50 in a failed attempt to destroy evidence.\n\nOfficers, however, recovered cash and a notebook (ZRP Book 6) showing that he had improperly recorded Mcupis arrest as dangerous parking.\n\nCourt found Dzimbanhete guilty of extortion after altering the earlier preferred charge of criminal abuse of duty as a public officer.\n\nIn a statement following sentencing, the National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) said law enforcement agents must uphold the highest standards of integrity.\n\nEvery officer is expected to serve with honour, professionalism, and respect for the law, the NPAZ noted.\n\n",

            "content": "Sowetan Live\n\nThe Limpopo pig farmer accused of killing two women who were scavenging for food on his property told the court that when he was alerted to the body of one of his victims, he panicked and left the scene until he returned the following day and put it in an empty pigsty.\n\nHe said he had expected the person who accompanied the intruders to come and collect the body. Then when they discovered the second body the following day, he and his employees also put it in a pigsty.\n\nThis is contained in an affidavit of Zachariah Johannes Olivier, which was read out in the Polokwane high court on Tuesday. Olivier denies that he intentionally killed Maria Makgato, 45 and Locadia Ndlovu, 34, in August last year then fed them to the pigs. Ndlovus husband survived the attack.\n\nHe said he had gone to the to spot where the women were shot expecting to see trespassers and he had tried to frighten them by shooting at them.\n\nOlivier, 60, and co-accused William Musora, 50, entered the second day of the trial yesterday. They face charges of murder, attempted murder, employing an illegal immigrant who does not possess a work permit and the possession of an unlicensed firearm.\n\nMusora, a Zimbabwean national, faces a further charge of contravention of the Immigration Act, for being in SA illegally.\n\nOn Monday, in a panicked state, I proceeded to cut up both rifles that were used to shoot the warning shots into pieces, and I disposed of such pieces as I was scared and disgusted with the rifles and what had transpired\n\nZachariah Johannes Olivier, farmer\n\nIn his affidavit, Olivier claims that after the discovery of the two bodies, he panicked and went home before returning the following day to destroy the guns used to shoot the two women.\n\nOn Monday, in a panicked state, I proceeded to cut up both rifles that were used to shoot the warning shots into pieces, and I disposed of such pieces as I was scared and disgusted with the rifles and what had transpired.\n\nI never had any intention of defeating the purpose of the administration of justice. I simply panicked and acted out of an extreme level of shock.\n\nAccording to Olivier, he called the police the following day as I could not deal with the situation any longer.\n\nThe state has since withdrawn charges against another farmworker, Adrian de Wet, 19, who is now a state witness. In his affidavit, Olivier claims that he was with de Wet on the night that the women were shot. De Wet, he claims, also fired shots.\n\nSpeaking to Sowetan outside court, Makgatos grieving mother said she will never forgive those who cut short her daughters life.\n\nWhy did he have to kill my child in such a brutal manner? Why did he not inform the police that people were trespassing on his farm, asked Moyahabo Mokgato.\n\nThe pensioner said she has been battling to take care of her household as well as her late daughters children aged 5, 12, 16 and 22 since Marias death.\n\nAfter they murdered my child, I am now struggling, as I do not work. Im unable to provide for my family.\n\nI cannot forgive them, she said.\n\nDuring proceedings, judge Jane Ngobeni informed the two men that should they be convicted of murder, they face life in prison. If they are first offenders, the sentence wont be less than 15 years.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFormer Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) leader Nelson Chamisa has called on the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) to emulate the Malawi Electoral Commission (MEC) in conducting transparentand credible elections.\n\nLast month, Malawians elected former President Peter Mutharika, who was declared the winner after securing 57% of the vote againstLazarus Chakweras 33%. Chakwera, a former pastor, conceded defeat before the final results were announced, calling Mutharika to congratulate him on his historic win.\n\nChamisa contrasted this with Zimbabwes deeply contested electoral history, saying the country has failed to conduct free and fair elections since the turn of the millennium.\n\nIn the 2023 general elections, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) observer mission noted, for the first time since 2008, that Zimbabwes polls did not meet the basic standards of credibility. The elections were marred by logistical chaos, with ZEC failing to deliver voting materials on time in major cities, forcing some polling stations to operate in darkness or reopen the next day\n\nUrban voters, traditionally opposition strongholds, were disproportionately affected by the delays, a situation critics say benefited the ruling Zanu PF, which continues to dominate rural areas.\n\nTaking to X, Chamisa said Zimbabwe should draw lessons from Malawis example of peaceful and credible elections.\n\nZimbabwes Electoral Commission (ZEC) should take notes from Malawis example where results reflect the true will of the people and peaceful transitions are possible, Chamisa said.\n\nHe also condemned the recurring cycle of violence and intimidation surrounding Zimbabwean elections.\n\nSince independence, Zimbabwe has faced violent and contested elections punctuated by a systematic obstruction of democratic change, trapping the nation in a vicious cycle of instability and inexorable conflict. Its time for Zimbabwe to commit to CITIZENOCRACY  an accountable, citizens-centred and citizens-driven system of government, he added.\n\nChamisa recalled the 2008 elections, during which more than 300 opposition supporters were reportedly killed in politically motivated violence, mostly targeting supporters of the late Morgan Tsvangirais Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).\n\nThe opposition leader, who also challenged President Emmerson Mnangagwas victories in 2018 and 2023, has repeatedly accused ZEC of bias and continues to reject Mnangagwas legitimacy.\n\nDespite the controversies, Chamisas then-18-month-old CCC party managed to deny Zanu PF a two-thirds majority in Parliament in the 2023 elections.\n\n",
