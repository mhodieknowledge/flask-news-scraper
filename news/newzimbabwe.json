            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFormer leader of the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), Nelson Chamisa, has revealed that his departure from both the CCC and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), was a calculated move aimed at frustrating President Emmerson Mnangagwa, whom he accuses of orchestrating a takeover of the opposition parties.\n\nChamisa resigned as leader of the CCC in January last year, citing the hijacking of his party by Mnangagwa as punishment for his refusal to accept the results of the chaotic August 2023 general elections.\n\nThe fallout from the elections saw Sengezo Tshabangu emerge, seemingly from nowhere, claiming to be the interim Secretary General of the CCC.\n\nTshabangus stated aim was to restore order within the opposition by addressing alleged irregularities in the candidate selection process leading up to the 2023 elections.\n\nTshabangu subsequently initiated a widespread recall of elected representatives, claiming that certain candidates had been improperly selected.\n\nThis led to the unprecedented recall of over 40 MPs and councillors, effectively handing Zanu-PF back the two-thirds parliamentary majority it had failed to secure during the harmonised elections.\n\nChamisas attempts to prevent these recalls, including written appeals to the then Local Government Minister July Moyo and Speaker of the National Assembly Jacob Mudenda, proved futile. The courts upheld the recalls, leaving Chamisa with no option but to step aside.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Thursday, Chamisa confirmed that his decision to leave the CCC was motivated by a desire to spite Mnangagwa.\n\nThe best decision I ever made in my leadership journey was to walk away from MDC & CCC. You will thank me later. I had to break the cycle of going in circles. And that was my best way to teach ED a lesson!, Chamisa declared.\n\nThis was not Chamisas first departure from a major political entity. He had previously walked away from the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) after a Supreme Court ruling questioned the legitimacy of his assumption of the party leadership following the death of Morgan Tsvangirai.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA dramatic power struggle has unfolded within the MDC-T party as Vice President Elias Mudzuri, allegedly in collaboration with Morgen Komichi, launched a bid to oust the partys embattled leader, Douglas Mwonzora, and seize control of Harvest House  the party headquarters in Harare CBD.\n\nThe move comes on the heels of a High Court ruling in late February 2025, in which Justice Hapias Zhou ordered Mwonzora to resign and facilitate a fresh congress within six months.\n\nThe ruling cited irregularities in the 2022 MDC-T Extraordinary Congress that saw Mwonzora elevated to the party leadership.\n\nMudzuri is arguing that, in light of Justice Zhous ruling, he is now the rightful leader of the party, by virtue of his position as Vice President.\n\nMudzuri arrived at Harvest House this morning with a considerable entourage, but was met with fierce resistance from Mwonzoras militant youth supporters, who aggressively blocked his entry.\n\nPolice intervention was ultimately required to prevent the situation from escalating further.\n\nMudzuri was seen leavingin his black Toyota Land Cruiser amidst the commotion.\n\nEarlier, Mudzuri had reportedly ordered Mwonzoras supporters and loyalists to vacate the building, prompting a heated confrontation.\n\nThis resulted in the arrival of truckloads of police officers in riot gear.\n\nMudzuri then briefly disappeared before resurfacing, claiming he had visited Harare Central Police Station to request a police escort to facilitate his occupation of Harvest House.\n\nMwonzora is no longer the President, as per the High Court ruling in February 2025. There is a void in the party presidency that must be filled, claimed one of Mudzuris security personnel, who requested anonymity.\n\nHowever, Albert Chidhakwa, the MDC National Youth Chairman and leader of Mwonzoras militant youth faction at Harvest House, insisted that Mudzuris actions are premature and invalid, as the party has lodged an appeal against Justice Zhous ruling.\n\nThe party has appealed Justice Zhous ruling. Mudzuri cannot rely on the High Court ruling because the appeal has rendered it ineffective. President Mwonzora remains the party leader. There is no change to that, he stated.\n\nThe battle for control of Harvest House has been a long-standing source of conflict within the opposition. It intensified following the Supreme Courts decision in March 2020 to nullify Nelson Chamisas ascendancy to the party presidency after the death of founding leader, Morgan Tsvangirai in 2018.\n\nWhile Mwonzora, in his then role as Secretary General, assumed leadership, he has struggled to maintain stability within the party. Many members defected to Chamisa and later to his Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), which was officially formed in 2022.\n\nMwonzoras party chose not to participate in the 2023 elections, citing concerns over irregularities in the delimitation exercise.\n\n",

On the premium inflows, the Zimbabwean operation contributed 68% for the year under review compared to 62% in 2023, whilst for the year under review 32% was attributable to the Malawi operation which contributed 38% in 2023, he said.\n\nThe insurance service result declined by 174% owing to higher insurance service expenses incurred compared to the earned revenue.
