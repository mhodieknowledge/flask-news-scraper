            "content": "By The Guardian\n\nTHE death toll from a huge earthquake that hit Myanmar has reached almost 700, as rescuers dig through the rubble of collapsed buildings in a desperate search for survivors.\n\nThe shallow 7.7-magnitude quake struck northwest of the city of Sagaing in central Myanmar in the early afternoon, followed minutes later by a 6.7-magnitude aftershock.\n\nThe quake destroyed buildings, downed bridges, and buckled roads across swathes of Myanmar, with severe damage reported in the second biggest city, Mandalay.\n\nAt least 694 people were killed and nearly 1,700 injured in Myanmars Mandalay region  believed to be the worst affected  the ruling junta said in a statement. About 10 more deaths have also been confirmed in Bangkok, the Thai capital, where a high rise building under construction collapsed.\n\nBut with communications badly disrupted, the true scale of the disaster has yet to emerge from the isolated military-ruled state, and the toll is expected to rise significantly.\n\nIt was the biggest quake to hit Myanmar in over a century, according to US geologists, and the tremors were powerful enough to severely damage buildings across Bangkok, hundreds of kilometres (miles) away from the epicentre.\n\nRescuers in the Thai capital laboured through the night searching for workers trapped when a 30-storey skyscraper under construction collapsed, reduced in seconds to a pile of rubble and twisted metal by the force of the shaking.\n\nBangkok governor Chadchart Sittipunt told AFP that about 10 people had been confirmed killed across the city, most in the skyscraper collapse.\n\nBut up to 100 workers were still unaccounted for at the building, close to the Chatuchak weekend market that is a magnet for tourists.\n\nBangkok city authorities said they will deploy more than 100 engineers to inspect buildings for safety after receiving over 2,000 reports of damage.\n\nWhile there was no widespread destruction, the shaking brought some dramatic images of rooftop swimming pools sloshing their contents down the side of many of the citys towering apartment blocks and hotels.\n\nEven hospitals were evacuated, with one woman delivering her baby outdoors after being moved from a hospital building. A surgeon also continued to operate on a patient after evacuating, completing the operation outside, a spokesperson told AFP.\n\nBut the worst of the damage was in Myanmar, where four years of civil war sparked by a military coup have ravaged the healthcare and emergency response systems.\n\nJunta chief Min Aung Hlaing issued an exceptionally rare appeal for international aid, indicating the severity of the calamity. Previous military regimes have shunned foreign assistance even after major natural disasters.\n\nThe country declared a state of emergency across the six worst-affected regions after the quake, and at one major hospital in the capital, Naypyidaw, medics were forced to treat the wounded in the open air.\n\nOne official described it as a mass casualty area.\n\nMandalay, a city of more than 1.7 million people, appeared to have been badly hit. Photos showed dozens of buildings reduced to rubble.\n\nA rescue worker from Amarapura, an ancient city and now a township of Mandalay, said the bodies of 30 people had been recovered from collapsed multistorey apartment blocks.\n\nI have never experienced anything like this before  our town looks like a collapsed city, he said, estimating that about a fifth of the buildings had been destroyed.\n\nA resident reached by phone told AFP that a hospital and a hotel had been destroyed, and said the city was badly lacking in rescue personnel.\n\nAnother witness in Mandalay, who asked not to be named, said eight people had been killed and others were feared to be trapped after a construction building in Pyigyitagon township collapsed.\n\nThe whole of Mandalay city was affected by the earthquake. The rescue teams and hospitals are now overrun. We are managing with the resources we have in the neighbourhood, they said.\n\nImages published by Khit Thit Media, a news agency based in Myanmar, showed piles of bricks and rubble outside a damaged mosque, also in Mandalay. At least 20 people had died there, it reported, though it was not possible to verify this figure.\n\nA huge queue of buses and lorries lined up at a checkpoint to enter Naypyidaw early on Saturday.\n\nOffers of foreign assistance began coming in, with President Donald Trump on Friday pledging US help.\n\nIts terrible, Trump told reporters in the Oval Office about the quake when asked if he would respond to the appeal by Myanmars military rulers.\n\nIts a real bad one, and we will be helping. Weve already spoken with the country.\n\nIndia, France and the European Union offered to provide assistance, while the WHO said it was mobilising to prepare trauma injury supplies. Chinas President Xi Jinping extended condolences, state media reported.\n\n(Agence France-Presse and Reuters contributed to this report).\n\n",

            "content": "By newZWire\n\nCBZ is Zimbabwes largest bank, but CEO Lawrence Nyazema sees it as a big fish in a small pond. He says its time for the bank to expand beyond the countrys bordersstarting this year.\n\nCBZ had planned to grow through mergers and acquisitions, including deals with First Mutual Limited and ZB, but competition regulators blocked the moves. Despite this setback, the bank is still convinced it can go international.\n\nWe cannot remain a Zimbabwean play, our partners are venturing out into the world, and we cannot leave them to go there alone, Nyazema told a meeting of top clients on Wednesday.\n\nCBZ will take its first steps outside Zimbabwe by the end of the year. Its first target is South Africa, which accounts for 70% of Africas insurance revenues. The bank is also looking at Botswana and other markets beyond Africa.\n\nWe like Botswana not as a market where we generate revenue, but we like Botswana because its friendly from a capital perspective, he said. We believe well be able to raise reasonably priced capital either to deploy in Botswana or to deploy elsewhere in the world.\n\nNyazema wants to see CBZ expanding into Africa, the Middle East, and the Americas. Our goal is to be present in seven African countries, one Middle Eastern country, and two South American countries.\n\nZimbabwean companies, especially banks, dont exactly have a stellar record in their attempts to operate in the region. The list of companies that tried and ran back home is long. Nyazema says CBZ will be more cautious, given the size of more experienced operators in the region.\n\nThe company is adopting a measured approach, acknowledging its relative size compared to established players in the target markets, he says. We acknowledge our size; we may be big in Zim, but we are very small elsewhere.\n\nTo scale up, CBZ will explore joint ventures or mergers and acquisitions where it can.\n\nThe bank is also looking to underwrite more business. After raising US$50 million in credit lines from Afreximbank in February, CBZ now plans to raise up to US$500 million this year. With Zimbabwe shut out of international markets, Nyazema sees this as a major achievement.\n\nRaising half a billion dollars is our goal, but it must be under the right conditions. If we achieve this, it will greatly benefit the economy by stimulating trade, supporting business activities across various sectors, and ultimately enhancing overall economic growth, Nyazema said.\n\n",

Those fronting the mobilisation should stand warned.\n\nThe countrys security services are on high alert to ensure the sustained safety and security of the public.

Equally, I need not emphasize that we are all expected to remain guided by the provisions of Section 164 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act and Section 164 of the Cyber Security and Data Protection Act on offences relating to electronic communications and materials.\n\nThe relevant instruments would be invoked to deal with those who unlawfully engage in transmitting, broadcasting and distributing data messages to any person, group of persons or to the public with the intent to incite acts of violence against any persons or to cause damage to any property.\n\n",
