Ministry of Tourism and Hospitality Industry, Ministry of Local Government and Public Works were nowhere to be seen, same as the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage. We want to encourage the Government of Zimbabwe to support such traditional and cultural heritage events, said Molokela.\n\nThe Government is at odds with the Ndebele King, Bulelani Khumalo, a descendant of Mzilikazi, refusing to recognise his kingship.\n\nMolokela further said Mzilikazi Day should be honoured and celebrated by the country.\n\nThe event attracted participants from all over Zimbabwe and some from the diaspora, especially from South Africa. Thousands of people from different generations, elders, youths, children, women, men, rural people and urban people attended the event from different cultures and languages.\n\nZimbabwe prides itself in cultural heritage, it prides itself in national identity and also decolonisation in terms of identity. An event like the one which we held on Saturday is something that as Zimbabweans, we must celebrate and encourage all districts, provinces, cultures and all languages in Zimbabwe to organise such kind of events so that as a nation, we can also be recognised that we have gone beyond the colonial system, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "Metro UKs foreign correspondent Gergana Krasteva reports from Zimbabwe\n\nBeads of sweat drip down Gilbert Nuovus forehead as the memories of working inone of Zimbabwes gold minesrush back in.\n\nOver a year ago, the dad-of-two deserted his job after a colleague was killed when the walls of the pit caved in, burying him alive.\n\nA friend of mine died on the spot. I was afraid for my life, so I went back home, he tellsMetro.\n\nThe road into Matabeleland North, 150 miles from the city of Bulawayo, is uneven and thick with dust, but I am assured that it will eventually lead to a gold mine.\n\nIt is one of the many precious materials for which the land here has been exploited since before British colonial rule, with the first extractions made as early as the 14th century.\n\nAs our SUV crawls forward, a line of workers stretches along the footpath  boys barely into their teens and weathered men three times their age.\n\nMost are wearing the same faded blue overalls, and chipped shovels slung over their shoulders  a sign theyworkin one of the legal mines.\n\nMatabeleland North sits on some of the richest deposits of gold in Africa, and so is plagued with artisanal pits, which are not officially registered with thegovernment, making them illegal.\n\nYet, tens of thousands of men and women are forced into the trade due to unemployment, making up the majority of the mining workforce.\n\nGordon Sibanda used to be one of them.\n\nMetrospeaks with him at the Libeni PrimarySchool, where he volunteers as a chef to somehow contribute to the local community while searching for work.\n\nSitting on a wooden log and smoothing his cooking apron, he admits that poverty is what drove him to mining in 2001, when he was 39.\n\nHe says: A friend introduced me to the trade. Many of my friends are still in the pits to this day.\n\nMining is strenuous labor. You can spend months searching for a mineral you cannot see and do not know if it is actually in the earth.\n\nAnd when luck would fall on our side, you may get something.\n\nIn Zimbabwes mines, death never seems far.\n\nSo when I ask Gordon if any of his colleagues were injured or killed in the pits, he replies, almost nonchalantly, as he takes off his woolen beanie: Ah yes. Three have been killed when the mines collapsed.\n\nDisintegrated shafts, explosions, flooding  each shift carries the chance that a worker will not return home.\n\nAs many as 237 people died in incidents in 2023, making it one of the very worst years in the countrys mining history.\n\nAnd up until May this year, 59 fatal incidents were reported  most in illegal mines, like the one that Gordon worked in.\n\nTo fully comprehend the vast scale of illegal mining,Metrosits down with Pumulu Masu, government school inspector, who says that most people in Matabeleland North dig without a permit, which means the state does not profit from it.\n\nMostly, people in the area mine illegally, she explains. Lets say there is an agricultural field. Instead of a farm, they will turn it into a mine.\n\nEven in their personal properties  behind their homes  people start to dig.\n\nWe can always tell by the maps of soil. If people suspect there is gold, they will always dig no matter what the land is.\n\nWhile Gordon worked in an illegal pit, Gilbert has experience in a registered mine.\n\nTheir only piece of advice  what they want everyone to know  is do not do it, do not work in a mine, pointing to how deadly the trade is.\n\nGilbert says: The pit is not that strong as miners often dig tunnels [without much planning], making the walls weak.\n\nWe are not given helmets or boots to protect us. It is difficult to survive.\n\nThe work is just too much. In mines, there are no set working hours.You work and you stop when it is time to eat, then you go back to work. It is continuous, we do not stop.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, mining runs through generations like a vein of gold itself. It is often seen as a rite of passage for children as young as nine, and at the same time a lifeline for families in the depths of poverty.\n\nThough the pay is still meagre. All the money Gordon earned was spent on food for his large family, all 13 of them.\n\nAt the time, he was the sole breadwinner for his wife, three sons and three daughters, his own parents and siblings.\n\nHand to mouth, nothing else [is left], he adds, gesturing at his grandson, a four-year-old boy playing with his friends a few metres away.\n\nYet, despite facing unemployment, Gordon has not given mining another thought because of the precarious conditions.\n\nLike him, Gilbert also did not live a life of luxury  but he was under no such illusions when he picked up a shovel.\n\nAfter three months of digging, he was paid around $20, and only after gold was actually discovered. Miners divvy up half the proceeds, while the rest goes straight to the owners pocket.\n\nThere are other dangers too.\n\nThe industry has long been linked to human rights abuses, environmental violations and labour exploitation, particularly in lithium mines operated byChina, despite denials by Zimbabwes government. About 70% of all lithium is processed there.\n\nRobert Mugabes successor, president Emmerson Mnangagwa, of ZANU-PF, has so far supported the takeovers, arguing they will bring economic growth.\n\nPerhaps this has materialised in the capital, Harare; yet, on the ground, in Matabeleland North, the mines have brought little benefits  if any  to the local community.\n\nMetrogained access to Turk, one of the oldest gold mines in Zimbabwe, located in the Bubbi District.\n\nArmed security usually guard gold mines, but today luck has fallen on our side  at least for a few minutes.\n\nPiles of reddish earth and stones mount inside the compound. A dragline excavator in the distance seems to have dosed off, but only momentarily.\n\nThe mine itself gapes before us, an abyss carved so deep and wide that, when peering over the edge, the bottom is not visible.\n\nAcross the road from the pit, a supermarket and two bars stand shoulder to shoulder, their doors flung wide open. A few men have gathered around a plastic table, kicking dust with their feet as they chat.\n\nThis is the heart of what is accepted as the traditional mining community in Zimbabwe.\n\nThere are no clinics or schools, or in fact any other reliable infrastructure apart from the mine.\n\nBars are always the first to spring up whenever gold is unearthed, offering miners a place to unwind and spend their hard-earned cash in.\n\nAs I come to learn, this has also led to alcohol abuse among workers who use drinking as a coping mechanism.\n\nA source, who wished to remain anonymous, tellsMetro: You cannot put a figure on how many people have died because of it. Some have been found dead on pavements.\n\nWorkers deaths are often blamed on the rise in popularity of an illicit brew called krango, which can cause severe organ damage, and is associated with soaring rates of binge drinking.\n\nMy source explains that it is mostly made from ethanol concentrate diluted with large amounts of water, adding: Krango is what it is all about in rural areas. It is packed in bottles of 250ml.\n\nSanctions on Zimbabwe were first introduced in the early 2000s, mainly by the UK, the EU, and the US, amid allegations of human rights abuses, electoral fraud, and Robert Mugabes land reform programme.\n\nThese measures are not broad trade embargoes. They focus on asset freezes and travel bans on senior government officials linked to the state.\n\nThe US also brought out the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act (ZDERA) in 2001, which restricted its access to international financial institutions.\n\nWhile the sanctions target political elites, the Zimbabwean government argues they have deterred foreign investment and limited lines of credit  so much so that the now vice president Constantino Chiwenga said the country had lost more than $150 billion.\n\nSome are even packed by legitimate companies. It is sold for just $0.50, and the strength is usually around 40% strength.\n\nDespite the reported issues plaguing Zimbabwes mines, the government is hellbent on expanding the industry  the faster, the better.\n\nFor a nation that fought so hard to rid itself from colonial rule, it now relies on investors from China, South Africa, Australia, Canada and the UK, and it is eager to attract more.\n\nThe sector as a whole accounts for more than 60% of export revenues and 13% of gross domestic product (GDP), according to national statistics from 2023.\n\nTo increase those numbers, the Zimbabwean government introduced the Vision 2030 plan to become an upper-middle-income economy by the end of the decade.\n\nSupposedly, one of the key objectives is to grow the mining sector to have a revenue of $12 billion per year.\n\nIt makes money, that is for sure, though not for the small miner like Gordon or Gilbert.\n\nThey are currently unemployed and living with the memories of the hell inside the mines.\n\n",

Before the rebasing of the economy, taxes were 30% of GDP (double Africas average ) making Zim the most taxed African country, Biti said.\n\nThe former finance minister said the government has no clear guiding ideas and is using taxes to cover up its reckless spending which falls on ordinary working people, leaving them with little or nothing to live on.\n\nAt any given time the average Zim pays annually at least 15 different types of taxes and levies that include PAYEE, corporate taxes, IMMT, VAT, Fuel levies, carbon taxes, AIDS levies , excise duties on alcohol and cigarettes presumptive taxes,stamp duties toll gates, vehicle licenses, ZBC, stamp duties, customs duties, capital gains taxes, rates,NSSA to name a few.\n\nAn ideological vacuous regime sees taxes as an antidote to an overzealous expansionary fiscal policy.\n\nHigh regressive taxes hit innocent working people who are left with little or no disposable income.\n\nLow disposable incomes underpin a crises of under accumulation, the basis of any economic recession.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA Magunje family was left shattered after their 20-year-old son murdered his own sister in cold blood, then lost his sight on the eve of his trial.\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Philda Muzofa, sitting with assessors in Chinhoyi, convicted Isaac Mashonga, now 28, of brutally killing his sister, Dadirai Mashonga, in their kitchen hut in Mashonga Village, Zvipani, Magunje, in July 2017.\n\nThe horror began when their 93-year-old father, Champion Mashonga, and his wife woke up to find their daughters headless body sprawled in blood.\n\nNo parent can imagine one of his or her children beheading his sibling in their kitchen, Muzofa said while delivering her judgment, calling it a tragedy that will haunt this family and community forever.\n\nOn the night of July 13, 2017, Isaac, then 20, arrived at his parents home in the company of a local businessman known as Giant, real name Robert Tichareva.\n\nThe businessman was arrested together with Mashonga, but has since passed on.\n\nProsecutors told the court the two had conspired to kill Dadirai for ritual purposes, with Isaac allegedly promised US$4,000 for the beheading.\n\nThat night, Dadirai was fast asleep in the kitchen hut.\n\nVillagers later testified that Isaac led Robert straight to her room.\n\nInside, she was strangled and then decapitated using a kitchen knife, axe and adze.\n\nThe pair stuffed the head into a green satchel and smuggled it out to a derelict building near the business centre.\n\nThe following morning, Isaac returned to the homestead wearing blood-soaked clothes.\n\nVillagers who gathered at the gruesome scene apprehended him, tied his hands, and later forced him to lead them to the hidden satchel. Inside was Dadirais head.\n\nHe confessed and showed us the weapons, testified his father, Champion. As a father, I had no reason to misrepresent the facts. I was simply a troubled father.\n\nAs if the ordeal was not enough, Isaac lost his sight while awaiting trial.\n\nPrison doctors confirmed he is now 80% blind, a development that deepened his elderly parents pain.\n\nFor this elderly couple, they have lost two children at the same time  one through death and one through incarceration, the judge noted.\n\nInside prison, Isaacs blindness has left him dependent on fellow inmates for food, bathing and movement. Being blind and in prison presents a double challenge, the court acknowledged, though ruling that disability could not shield him from punishment.\n\nIsaac had claimed he was drugged by Robert and acted under the businessmans instructions. But Justice Muzofa dismissed his story as far-fetched and chicanery.\n\nThe accused literally took the Court for granted, the judge said. He carried the satchel fully aware that it had his sisters head. He then went to sleep. How can a person conduct himself likewise and yet claim he was intoxicated?\n\nThe court found that Isaac acted as a willing accomplice. The proved facts admit of no other inference except that the accused was part of this grand plan, Justice Muzofa ruled.\n\nThe judge said the killing had induced a sense of shock and revulsion in the community and branded it murder in aggravating circumstances.\n\nAlthough Isaacs youth, six years in pre-trial custody and his disability were considered, the court said retribution and deterrence must prevail.\n\nHe now faces decades behind bars,blind, broken, and carrying the weight of a family curse: the brother who killed his sister and destroyed his parents twilight years.\n\n",
