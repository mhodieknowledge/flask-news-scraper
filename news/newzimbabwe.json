            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nHARARE Mayor Jacob Mafume has exposed a can of worms regarding how Council executives embezzled over US$1 million to purchase the latest vehicles in an inexplicable scheme.\n\nMafume made these revelations on Tuesday as he concluded his testimony before the Commission of Inquiry, which is investigating the operations of the Harare City Council.\n\nIn 2023, the Harare City Council (HCC) executive, led by the then Town Clerk Hosiah Chisango, purchased Toyota Fortuners using remittances from Harare City Parka subsidiary of the HCC.\n\nMafume revealed that the vehicles are being used by top officials, and no action has been taken to explain the purchase, which was made without the Councils approval.\n\nThat is one of the biggest challenges because last year City Parking brought to the City Council about a million. When we started asking where that US$1 million went that is where the problem began and I am told that the US$1 million was used to purchase executive cars or Fortuners and so forth, said Mafume.\n\nMafume told the Commission, led by retired Justice Maphios Cheda, that the purchase of the top-of-the-range vehicles was made when the Council was dissolved before the elections.\n\nIt happened towards 2023. Towards the elections. City Parking used to enforce one by-law which is the parking by-law then we made a resolution for them to enforce another by-law to give them two.\n\nThe sharing of the revenue was that they collect the revenue and we get 50 percent of that. Now because it was the first time they implemented that by-law, it raised US$2 million and the US$1 million was then remitted to the City Council.\n\nWe were going to the elections and the City Council dissolved. When we came back we said what happened with that US$1 million because we had earmarked it for doing the parking and all that. We were told that it was used. What it was used for and how it was used and we then learnt that purchases of vehicles for the Executives had been done in the time whilst we had the electioneering, he said.\n\nThe chaos currently reigning at the Town House has been attributed to the lack of a functioning Electronic Resource Planning (ERP) system.\n\nThe absence of an ERP system has resulted in financial mismanagement and unaccounted leakages of funds by the City Council.\n\nThe Commission of Inquirys evidence leader, Thabani Mpofu, revealed that executives at the Council are spending US$125,000 per year on holidays. The Town Clerk is entitled to one international trip per year, while other executives are entitled to a regional trip.\n\nThese holidays are paid for using ratepayers money, which the Council has claimed it does not have, hence the poor service delivery in the city.\n\nWhen questioned about the astronomical figures, Mafume professed ignorance, stating that he was shocked by the amounts.\n\nFrom the figures, I will have no right to dispute those figures they do not come through me. I have no access to that. I am actually shocked at the figures and the information because they come at a time when we as Councillors are being asked and everybody is being asked to tighten their belts. Others are loosening, said Mafume.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commission of Inquiry has completed its public hearings. The Commission will compile a report, which will be presented to President Emmerson Mnangagwa upon finalisation.\n\n",

This is no longer realisable due to challenges associated with the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and fluctuation in funding from the international donor community.\n\nAs a result, we are working on submitting another three-year extension request to the Secretariat of the Treaty.\n\nThe funding gap as at September 2024 and completion of mine clearance in Zimbabwe by 2028 was US$23.79 million. Muchinguri said.\n\nShe addedthatthe government will keep funding the demining project.\n\nOn its part, the Government of Zimbabwe will continue to fund the National Mine Clearance Unit which requires a minimum of US$2,000,000 per year.\n\nIt is our hope that deliberations during this workshop will help unlock funding for mine action in Zimbabwe as completion of mine clearance hinged on sustained funding from the government and current and new donors.\n\nCompletion of mine clearance in Zimbabwe will not only help enhance safety and security in affected communities but will also go a long way in unlocking sustainable socio-economic development, she added.\n\nSince 1980, landmines have killed or injured over 1,500 people, while more than 120,000 livestock have also died as a result.\n\nThese minefields are in six provincesMatabeleland North, Mashonaland West, Mashonaland Central, Mashonaland East, Manicaland, and Masvingocovering 310,650 square kilometers.\n\n",

The current system, which favours elites who can afford Cambridge examinations, is discriminatory and perpetuates inequality.\n\nIt is deeply concerning that duty bearers, including government officials, continue to neglect ZIMSEC while their own children sit for Cambridge examinations, the union said.\n\nIn the wake of ZIMSEC exam registrations, the teachers group bemoaned chronic underfunding of the local exams body and called for the urgent availing of resources by the government.\n\nThe teachers union castigated ZIMSECs higher fees for private candidates saying they are unjust and exploitative and warned that the excess funds collected from private candidates are likely to be lost to corruption, further undermining the integrity of the examination system.\n\nThe lobby group said the gazetted US$11 and US$24 to be paid subject to payment by O and ALevel students is way beyond affordability and brings to question whether the governments subsidies towards basic education still exist.\n\n The governments claim of covering 55% of the fees is a fabrication designed to create the illusion of support while shifting the burden onto parents and guardians, added ARTUZ.\n\n",

SAPS is investigating, with the Family Violence, Child Protection, and Sexual Investigations (FCS) unit taking the lead.\n\nThis follows the release of number of videos, showing security personnel using excessive force  allegedly at the club  against suspects linked to phone thefts, prompting a widespread condemnation of the actions captured on tape.\n\nPolice had urged victims and witnesses to come forward, and three individuals, out of a group of five friends who had been assaulted, have reported incidents of abuse at the Brooklyn police station.\n\nThe victims recounted harrowing experiences that further substantiated the claims circulating online. The SAPS revealed that they are currently investigating serious charges, including compelled rape, assault, crimen injuria, intimidation, and kidnapping.\n\nAuthorities have flagged these incidents as severe human rights violations, with allegations ranging from kidnapping to sexual assault and attempted murder.\n\nAt the centre of the unfolding situation, a former nightclub bouncer named Pablo  believed to have released the videos  has come forward, claiming to possess crucial evidence for the investigation.\n\nHe claims that he holds more than 75 additional videos revealing the dark activities within Zanzou.\n\nEverything is true. Everything is 100% true, he said.\n\nPablo further elaborated on fatal incidents at the club and revealed that he has received death threats due to his knowledge of the clubs operations.\n\nMeanwhile, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) held a picket outside the nightclub, demanding the arrest of the owner and the establishments closure.

At the time when management became aware of these practices, an immediate investigation was conducted, which resulted in the immediate halting of such as well as the dismissal of security personnel responsible for the perpetration thereof, the statement read.\n\nIn a swift response to a series of distressing videos that have circulated on social media, Zanzou Management has taken decisive action following the exposure of security personnel employing excessive force against individuals suspected of phone theft.

            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has dismissed claims that controversial businessman Wicknell Chivayo is acting as his frontman, distributing vehicles and cash donations to various individuals, largely from his ruling Zanu-PF party and the artistic community.\n\nHe has defended Chivayo as a philanthropist, a view sharply at odds with that of his deputy, Constantino Chiwenga, who appears to consider Chivayo an unscrupulous businessman.\n\nRumours have been rife, that Chivayo is being used by Mnangagwa to lavish gifts  from luxury to budget vehicles  on strategic individuals, particularly artists, in a bid to drum up support for a potential presidential term extension. This is despite Mnangagwa maintaining that he will abide by the constitution and step down in 2028.\n\nAddressing journalists at State House on Monday, Mnangagwa refuted allegations that he is providing Chivayo with funds to splash around the country at a time when the economy and social services are on their knees.\n\nWhere would I get the money to give him? he questioned.\n\nInvestigate where you think Im getting the money to give Chivayo to distribute, rather than wasting my time worrying about someone who is using his own money. You cant bother me about someone who is philanthropic. If anyones money was stolen then they should report to the police.\n\n\"Kana pane akabirwa please report to the police\"  President Mnangagwa comments on Chivayo's splurging\n\nJoin thehttps://t.co/iVVKatQx0sChannelhttps://t.co/4EHrosKaUfpic.twitter.com/KCqUAs56mV\n\n NewZimbabwe.com (@NewZimbabweCom)February 17, 2025\n\nChivayo has been seen distributing vehicles and cash across the country, even, on occasion, throwing banknotes into the crowd, prompting desperate Zimbabweans to scramble for the money.\n\nWhile Mnangagwa paints Chivayo as a benevolent benefactor, his deputy, Constantino Chiwenga, views him in a distinctly different light.\n\nAddressing mourners at the National Shrine last month, Chiwenga, though not mentioning Chivayo by name, launched a veiled attack on his character, referring to him as a chigananda. Translated, this term implies someone who engages in dubious deals at the expense of others.\n\nVision 2030 is for all of us, not those you refer to asmbinga. During the liberation struggle, we referred to those aszvigananda.\n\nTo add fuel to the fire, Chivayo has publicly voiced his support on X (formerly Twitter) for Mnangagwas presidential term extension, arguing that the Zanu-PF leaders vision must be supported, not derailed.\n\nOutspoken Zanu-PF Central Committee member and war veteran Blessed Geza, now hunted by the police after his explosive press conference demanding Mnangagwas resignation (chiefly due to corruption), has also turned his ire towards Chivayo.\n\nGeza questioned the provenance of Chivayos seemingly limitless wealth, implicitly pointing the finger at Mnangagwa, suggesting his actions are merely to divert attention.\n\n",
