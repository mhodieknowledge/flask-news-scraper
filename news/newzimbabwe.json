            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nExpelled Zanu PF Central Committee member and militant war veteran Blessed Geza has resurfaced, reminding President Emmerson Mnangagwa of the support he received from his deputy, Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, during the 2017 military coup that ousted former and late President Robert Mugabe from power.\n\nGezas address comes on the heels of a thinly veiled attack on Chiwenga by Zanu PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa, who labelled the former military boss uneducated and cruel, particularly towards women, branding him unfit to succeed Mnangagwa as President.\n\nGeza, who disappeared after previous explosive press briefings aired via Heart and Soul Television (HSTV)  resulting in the arrest of its head and Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) journalist Blessed Mhlanga  re-emerged clad in visibly new military garb, warning Mnangagwa that his time in office is up.\n\nGeza took time to remind Mnangagwa of the support he got from Chiwenga when he fled the country hours after his dismissal as Vice President on November 6, 2017.\n\nMnangagwas expulsion was the spark that lit the tinderbox, setting in motion Operation Restore Legacy led by General Chiwenga in 2017, the historic period referred to as the Two Weeks in November.\n\nYou poisoned General Chiwenga, who assisted you when you had run away. Mugabe wanted to give power to Chiwenga, but he refused. But today you are going after Chiwenga. Are you sure? What exactly did you do during the liberation struggle? fumed Geza.\n\nGeza laid into Mnangagwa, alleging that the Zanu PF figurehead was involved in the poisoning of Chiwenga, referring to when the latter was flown to China for medical attention in 2020.\n\nMnangagwa was 100 per cent involved in the poisoning of General Chiwenga. I have the evidence from his brother, called Joseph Rera. When Mnangagwa was asked by Rera how General Chiwenga was coping with his health while in China, Mnangagwa, you said Chiwenga was a goner, and that he would return to Zimbabwe in a coffin, Geza claimed.\n\nHe further alleged that Mnangagwa had a hand in the deaths of scores of military generals, especially during the Covid-19 era.\n\nGeza further challenged Mnangagwa to arrest him, saying that the Zanu PF figurehead knows his whereabouts.\n\nI am very safe and in buzzing good health. Mnangagwa knows where I am.\n\nRelentless Geza also laid into Christopher Mutsvangwa, warning that he should zip up, otherwise, he will open a can of worms, revealing secrets that would expose him as an anti-revolutionary during the liberation struggle.\n\n",

The suspects went on to tie the hands of the complainants with electric cables before covering their faces with blankets.\n\nThey demanded for gold and cash. The suspects ransacked the whole shop and took away unknown amount of cash, groceries, 48 volts lithium battery, inverter, 9kg gas tank and cellphones, added Nyathi.\n\nThe gang them fled the scene in their getaway vehicle, a silver Honda Fit registration number AEY4843.\n\nOne of the complainants untied themself and called the employer, who quickly alerted police who made a follow up.\n\nDetectives tracked the getaway vehicle and spotted it along the highway as it approached the tollgate.\n\nNyathi said the suspects defied police orders to stop before the dramatic exchange of gunfire ensued.\n\nDetectives ordered the suspects to stop. Instead, the suspects fired shots towards the police officers leading to a shoot-out.\n\nThe suspects went on to hit a boom gate at the tollgate. They were arrested and taken to United Bulawayo Hospital (UBH) where they all unfortunately passed on, he said.\n\nAt the scene, police recovered property stolen from the shop as well as ammunition used in commotion of the crime.\n\n",

He vows never to return to what he sees as a den of iniquity, run by charlatans preying on unsuspecting congregants.\n\nHoly Ten unleashed these reputation-damaging details during a recent appearance on DJ Ollahs Podcast, claiming Angel routinely propositioned him to find young women for the man of the cloth to bed.\n\nI was first inspired to pray by Uebert Angel. I didnt have to meet him then, I would just watch his sermons. For him to become the gentleman who asks me to find chicks  slay queens  was the worst thing ever. I went to their church where I performed. Mudiwa was showing me guns. From there, I began to doubt their faith, he said.\n\nHoly Ten said it was a source of deep embarrassment that Angel, given his supposed holy standing, would make such requests.\n\nNot only guns, but Mudiwa then opened his bag and showed me condoms. I swear, and Im ready to be taken to court for this, I swear that I will never return to their church again. You can ask my crew. Those people are spinning a yarn, he said.\n\nAngel presides over the Good News Church\n\nTwo years ago, he was embroiled in controversy after being exposed in the four-part Al Jazeera documentary, The Gold Mafia, which detailed undercover operations across three continents and revealed a trove of incriminating documents capturing gold smuggling.\n\nAngel was secretly filmed boasting that he could move over US$1 billion of dirty cash with ease, leveraging his diplomatic immunity to facilitate a scheme where unaccounted funds could be exchanged for Zimbabwes gold.\n\nAngel and his business partner, Rikki Doolan, further claimed their laundering operations had the blessing of President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nMudiwa Hood, on the other hand, is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and founder of several companies, including Sky Angel Private Jet Charter, Fundmass, Optima Construction, Disrupt Media, and Bisep Security.\n\nHe fancies himself a serial entrepreneur, author, and fashion mogul.\n\nHoly Tens accusations have struck a chord, laying bare the hypocrisy he perceives within these circles.\n\nThese revelations, if true, paint a portrait of men drunk on power, flaunting wealth, and abusing their positions with impunity.\n\n",

Chiwenga is fronting another faction within the party that is all but ready to push Mnangagwa out if he is convinced to hold on to power.\n\nSpeaking at a party event in Mutare over the weekend, Chinamasa said they were ready to speak to the partys politburo and central committees about the issue.\n\nIf the two institutions of the party grant them approval to approach government, said Chinamasa, then they would proceed with efforts to amend the Zimbabwean constitution.\n\nOnce we have a clear plan, which includes consultations with the politburo and central committee, we will instruct government to amend the constitution of Zimbabwe, said Chinamasa to loud applause at the Manicaland District Coordinating Committee meeting.\n\nWe believe that Mnangagwa should finish what he started, what we will do is just convince him to stay up till 2030. If he agrees we would have achieved what was proposed by last years 2030 resolution.\n\nWe want to see how this resolution can be implemented and how the constitution can be amended. We want to know which platforms have to be approached first.\n\nWe will start with the politburo and then the central committee where we will continue requesting that they allow us to give the government the go-ahead to change our constitution.\n\nSection 91(2) of Zimbabwes 2013 constitution bars Mnangagwa from going beyond his constitutionally mandated two terms while its Section 328(7) disqualifies him from benefiting if there are to be any constitutional amendments that might seek to favour an incumbent.\n\nEven despite these clear constitutional provisions, sections, mainly from his home province of Masvingo, are demanding that he stay on while shutting out any hope of Chiwenga taking over.\n\nChiwenga, who is yet to publicly share his presidential aspirations, was recently laid into by party spokesperson and Mnangagwa ally Christopher Mutsvangwa who declared him unworthy to lead.\n\nThe former army general is reported to be livid and has demanded action be taken against Mutsvangwa in what looks to be another interesting episode of Zanu PF factional fights drama.\n\n",

He told me it would be a rough road ahead, he explained how difficult it was just to make the Olympic team let alone win a medal, but he believed in me, she wrote in a Facebook post a few years ago.\n\nAt the age of 20, she made her dream come true. At the 2004 Games in Athens, Coventry won the gold medal in the 200-meter backstroke. Four years later, in 2008 in Beijing, she won gold again. In addition to those two gold medals, she collected four Olympic silver medals and one bronze. This makes Coventry Africas most successful female Olympian of all time. The only African who has had more success at the Olympics is long-distance runner Tirunesh Dibaba of Ethiopia  who won three gold medals (and two bronze).\n\nI have been to five Olympic Games, won seven individual Olympic medals, broken multiple world records and had one of the best World Championship careers of all time, Coventry wrote on her Linkedin profile.\n\nHowever, none of this is as important as what this success did and can do for others. It united my country where divisions caused by economic and political turmoil were crippling it, and it gave hope to people who thought their circumstances prevented them from following their dreams.\n\nWhile still an active swimmer, Coventry was elected to the IOC Athletes Commission in 2013. She represented the interests of athletes for eight years, including three years as chairperson. More recently, she has been a member of the IOC Executive Board.\n\nThe increased influence of the Zimbabwean has raised hopes in Africa that the Summer Olympics could be hosted on the African continent for the first time.\n\nAlthoughSouth AfricaandEgypthave expressed their interest, Coventry has played down such expectations.\n\nThe interest is there and now we need to ensure that were working closely with all of these countries that are interested so that they fully understand the magnitude of the Olympic Games, she said.\n\nThe countries of Africa, Coventry said in a Q&A session organized by the Association of International Sports Journalists (AIPS), should really strategically look from the African Union point of view on how we can develop through the All Africa Games our infrastructure that can then be followed up and used by an Olympic Games bid.\n\nCoventry knows from experience just how tough such political processes can be. She has been Zimbabwes Minister of Sport since 2018. She says she now has definitely a thicker skin than she used toas an athlete.\n\nWhen asked whether she thinks trans women should be allowed to compete in womens competitions, she was evasive.\n\n100% it is necessary to find a solution, Coventry said. I think that we as the IOC have to take a little bit more of a leadership role.\n\nThe Zimbabwean also avoided going too far out on a limb on another hot topic before the IOC election: the possibility of Russian and Belarusian athletes competing at the Olympics.\n\nI think above anything else its our duty as the IOC to ensure that all athletes can participate at the Games, she said. Thats going to look different for a number of different athletes but at the end of the day I do believe that we need to find a holistic way of sadly dealing with athletes from conflict areas.\n\nShe was speaking in light of her experience competing for Zimbabwe at a time when the country was in political turmoil and under international sanctions.\n\nIt could have been very easy for the international community to not allow us to take part. I look at (it) and say what would my life be today? I am grateful that I was not held accountable for what the leaders and governments were doing.\n\nKirsty Coventry is not only a sports administrator and politician, but also a mother. She gave birth to her second daughter less than six months ago. Her eldest is six years old.\n\nBy the time she was one year old, she had already been to 10 different countries around the world, Coventry said.\n\nI have an incredible network of support from my husband and family. This is a normal way of life for us. I think its a good way to show that women are just as capable as men even if we are to be expected to be full-time mothers, wives, daughters etc.\n\nWe still have a lot of work to do, and I am excited about leading this movement, Coventry said of gender equality. Women are ready to lead. I look at it as an opportunity to push through boundaries so that when my two girls are growing up, they dont have the same boundaries.\n\n",

The advent of AI and automation is reshaping traditional employment structures, raising concerns about job security, fair wages and protection of workers rights.\n\nAs AI continues to permeate into workplaces new forms of labour disputes may arise necessitating adaptative and forward-looking dispute resolution mechanisms that account for algorithm decision making, data privacy and equitable access to opportunities, he said.\n\nSpeaking at a different event during the same week, UN resident coordinator, Edward Kallon said AI presents both opportunities and threats.\n\nUnited Nations resident coordinator Edward Kallon said AI was a key driver of the fourth industrial revolution.\n\nIn view of these realities, countries across the globe are increasingly positioning themselves to take full advantage of opportunities presented by these technological innovations and in particular, artificial intelligence, to advance their respective national development agendas and, consequently, transform the lives of their citizens.\n\nIt is, however, also true that as transformative as these technologies are, there are many risks associated with them, both inherent and overt, that cannot be overlooked and hence must be addressed by countries to ensure the development and application of AI systems in both the public and private sectors are ethically compliant, he said.\n\n",
