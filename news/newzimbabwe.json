Technology doesnt discriminate  it does not care about your face, relationship, or status. It ensures fairness and holds everyone accountable, read the statement.\n\nThe smart traffic management system is part of a wider scheme to reduce road carnage, congestion and corruption.\n\nA Dubai-based company, Vitronic Machine Vision Middle East, is reportedly spearheading the project through a public-private partnership.\n\nThe firm is set to inject an initial investment of an estimated US$80 million into this novel plan.\n\nThey underscored the importance of transitioning to electronic traffic management, highlighting its impartiality and efficiency.\n\nWhile the system is being implemented, police presence, roadblocks, and traffic controls will remain essential tools for maintaining order.\n\nThe ministers also called on drivers to adhere to traffic laws and urged the public to collaborate with the police in upholding safety standards, particularly during public holidays such as Independence and Easter.\n\nThe ministers warned of stiffer penalties for traffic offenders in a bid to tame the traffic jungle.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA group of former white farmers who were displaced during the 2000s land reform programme has rejected the governments dollar-bonds compensation deal, citing that it is reliant on very uncertain and very high-risk long-term payouts.\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncube recently revealed that treasury bonds worth US$308 million and cash payments had been made to former white farm owners. Receipt of the payments was confirmed by ex-Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) leader Andrew Pascoe, whom the group now says was voted out in 2024 after agreeing to a deal they had rejected.\n\nNcube last week said after the cash payment the balance will be paid in treasury bonds with a 2% coupon and maturities of two years, which the former white farmers Compensation Steering Committee (CSC) has rejected.\n\nAngus Selby, a representative of the CSC said these bonds do not clear the debt but merely convert displaced farmers (Title Deed Holders) into bondholders reliant on very uncertain, very high-risk, very long-term payouts.\n\nThe payments are under the Global Compensation Deed (GCD) signed in 2020, where government agreed to pay a discounted US$3,5 billion to the former white farm owners.\n\nThe acting chairman of the former white farmers CSC Deon Theron said, the overwhelming majority of farmers supported this deal in a survey at the time but, to date, almost five (5) years on, nothing has been paid per this agreement.\n\nInstead, in 2023 the government offered an alternative payment schedule in Government Treasury Bills over ten years heavily weighted towards years 5-10, a token 2 percent interest rate was added which compares to regional USD interest rates of 10-20%.\n\nThe revised offer was put to the farmers in April 2023 via a formal survey in which it was rejected by the majority of farmers. Whereas 3100 voted in favour of the 2020 proposal, only 782 voted for the adjusted offer in 2023.\n\nHe added that the few farmers who have accepted the governments deal did so because they are destitute and in urgent need of money for food and healthcare.\n\nTheron revealed this was clearly communicated to the government in an official correspondence.\n\nDespite this rejection, the government pushed ahead with the revised offer that became known as the Farmers Compensation Agreement (FCA) in which 378 farms have now (nearly two years later) received initial payments of 1% of their share of the discounted offer.\n\nThe bottom line is that governments recent payments represent a tiny fraction of the GCDs $3.5 billion which is already a substantial discount on the actual value of the properties, and these payments have reached fewer than 10% of farmers, stated Theron.\n\nThe FCA was originally presented as interim relief payments for distressed farmers, but is now being repositioned and repackaged as a comprehensive compensation solution.\n\nThis is simply not the case.\n\nThe Land Compensation Committee approved compensation for 740 former white farmers, which the former white farmers committee says is only a fraction of the over 4,500 who were displaced by the land grabs.\n\nIn reality, only a small token payment has been made and thousands of farmers, the significant majority by number remain uncompensated, Theron said.\n\nLater former President Robert Mugabe pioneered the land reform programme in 2000 which saw violent evictions of more than 4000 white farmers.\n\n",

It is the worlds largest free trade area by number of participating countries, connecting 1,3 billion people across 55 countries.\n\nPresenting the group performance for the period ended December 31 2024, ZHL board chairman, Desmond Matete, said going forward, regional expansion will be a priority.\n\nAs we look to 2025, the Group is focused on regional expansion and market diversification, strengthening operations across Sub-Saharan Africa, leveraging on the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to access new opportunities, he said.\n\nHe said a key priority for this year is the implementation of Phase 2 of the amalgamation exercise through the potential listing of Emeritus International on the Botswana Stock Exchange. The listing will upscale the balance sheets of the regional subsidiaries, improving underwriting capacity to enhance competitiveness while exposing the Group to international best practice.\n\nAdditionally, the Eagle REIT listing in 2025 is expected to unlock shareholder value, enhance brand visibility and optimise asset returns. To drive operational efficiency, the Group is accelerating its digital transformation agenda, enhancing customer experiences through technology-driven insurance and wealth management solutions. A key focus is ensuring responsible data usage and stakeholder protection, reinforcing ZHLs position as a trusted financial services provider.\n\nDuring the period, insurance contract revenue recorded a significant increase of 24%, from USD50.0 million to USD61.86 million, attributable to strong business growth in key business segments, namely life and pension, local reinsurance, and the Mozambique reinsurance operations, with a combined contribution of 63% up from 61% in 2023.\n\nOverall, the key revenue growth drivers were increased market share locally, thanks to a diverse range of products; external business partnerships, new life business written and expansion into the rest of Africa through the Groups regional business units, added Matete.\n\n",

Considering the magnitude of this issue and the oversight function of the council as provided in the Urban Councils Act [29:15], turning a blind eye on this matter will make elected representatives (councillors) accomplices, read the statement.\n\nWith the Council realising that it erred in approving the plan, residents will bear the brunt of paying the compensation costs as the building faces demolition. The double-storey building infringes on the frontage line and extends onto Alpes Road.\n\nCHRA said residents cannot shoulder the consequences of the City of Harares rushed approval.\n\nWe affirm that residents and ratepayers of Harare cannot bear the consequences and cost of this gross incompetence and maladministration within the City of Harares planning division without disciplinary measures being taken, read the statement.\n\nThe Harare City Council has come under intense scrutiny after overseeing the approval of questionable plans.\n\nAuthorities at Town House have conceded that certain plans were approved without due diligence.\n\nCHRA said the Vainona building is not an isolated case, as many approved projects violate the council bylaws.\n\nThe Vainona case is similar to other construction activities that have been approved by the local authority in Ecologically Sensitive Areas (wetlands) gazetted by the Government of Zimbabwe across the city.\n\nWe suspect that there were some underhand dealings relating to this matter, hence we call on the local authority to conduct an urgent investigation, read the statement further.\n\n",

He died at the scene.\n\nGauteng police said they were still searching for the motorist implicated in the brutal death of a man following a heated dispute.\n\nMunetsi, a lawyer by profession, said he was providing legal support to the victims family.\n\nFor now I am giving the family legal support. At the same time, we were encouraging the Zimbabwean community in Joburg to raise funeral money through contributions. The funeral contributions are coming from the Zimbabwean community, Munetsi told IOL.\n\nMunetsi is popular among the South African and Zimbabwean communities in Gauteng as an anti-crime and social cohesion activist.\n\nHe is also a successful businessman who runs an international company, Greathope Insurance.\n\nSpeaking about the incident, Munetsi said: The body of Emmanuel has been repatriated already for burial in Zimbabwe.\n\nEmmanuels murder has attracted international news headlines, with many social media users questioning why the alleged killer has not been arrested.\n\nThe incident unfolded on April 5, 2025, in Rivonia, Sandton, and culminated in a tragic and violent confrontation that ended in Mahamba being run over by a Ford Ranger bakkie multiple times.\n\nOn his Facebook page, which has more than 144,000 followers, Munetsi held a live conversation with Ntombi, the woman who was involved in a relationship with Mahamba, while she lived with her other romantic partner.\n\nThe Ugandan man, who has two children with Ntombi, allegedly murdered Emmanuel in the bakkie attack.\n\nI agree that I once dated Emmanuel in January, and we broke up in February. Yes, we were in a relationship. We broke up because some Ugandans recorded a video of me when I was with the guy (Emmanuel). My baby daddy is a Ugandan. So I broke up with Emmanuel for my safety, for my kids and also for the sake of Emmanuel. I stopped talking to Emmanuel.\n\nNtombi said on the fateful day, Emmanuel and some Ugandan men who lived at the same house with, came over to her work premises. Ntombis baby daddy was already at the business premises, where motorbike parts are sold.\n\nLater on, I heard some noise, people fighting. When I went outside, I asked Emmanuel what he was doing, but he did not even respond to me; he only looked at me. He was holding a stone, and he threw it away. He picked it again and hit the vehicles (wind) screen. That is when my baby daddy got angry, went to Emmanuel and beat him, she said.\n\nSUSPECT WANTED FOR MURDER\n\nPolice are looking for a suspect who was driving a black Ford Ranger Double cab wiyh registration number KV10WLGP in Sandton, Rivonia next to Mzanzi building anyone with information can contact the police on 08600 10111.pic.twitter.com/HC2fq60B80\n\nIn the video, Ntombi can be seen screaming, frantically trying to stop the Ford Ranger driver.\n\nNarrating how she fell in love with the deceased man, Ntombi said she met Emmanuel at Rivonia, Sandton, as he used to come to the shop that she works at, buying motorbike parts.\n\nShe said when she met Emmanuel this year, she was still involved with the Ugandan man although the relationship was experiencing some difficulties. Ntombi was living with the Ugandan man when she started dating Emmanuel.\n\nI had to date Emmanuel, she told Munetsi in the Facebook live session.\n\nNtombi has two children with the Ugandan man and the two have been in a relationship for around three years.\n\nThe Ugandan men who came to the premises with Emmanuel, according to Ntombi, had previously recorded a video of her and Emmanuel and they had also informed Ntombis other boyfriend, the Ugandan man who drives a Ford Ranger.\n\nEmmanuel had not told me that he was staying (at a house) with Ugandans. I was at Emmanuels place and I went out, they recorded the video and sent it to my boyfriend, the baby daddy. In the video, I was walking while holding hands with Emmanuel. I then told Emmanuel that we had to end our relationship, she said.\n\nNtombi said she was confronted angrily by her baby daddy over her romantic relationship with Emmanuel. She said the Ugandan man was very angry, and she decided to end things with Emmanuel.\n\nPolice spokesperson, Colonel Dimakatso Nevhuhulwi, said police received a complaint regarding the incident and upon arrival, they found a man lying on the side of the road with injuries all over his body.\n\nThe paramedics declared him dead on the scene. According to information at hand, the victim reportedly argued with the shop owner and allegedly hit the shop owners vehicle with a brick, breaking the windscreen. The shop owner reportedly came out and drove over his body several times before fleeing the scene, said Nevhuhulwi.\n\n",

An urgent application has been filed in the Johannesburg High Court, naming the hospital, the ministers of health and home affairs, the Gauteng MEC for health, and a treating doctor as respondents.\n\nIn her affidavit, Ncube said a doctor told her Vanessa cannot undergo a liver transplant until sheNcubeproduces a valid visa or permit. This application is urgent and cannot wait to be heard on the ordinary roll because my daughter is extremely unwell, she stated. Her condition is so dire and exigent that the matter cannot wait.\n\nVanessa was diagnosed in December 2024 and has been in and out of hospital since then, with her health rapidly declining. Last month, Ncube was informed about the types of transplants availableeither from a deceased donor or a living relative. But despite her daughters deteriorating condition, she was not provided with any legal justification for the exclusion of non-South African children from access to deceased donor transplants.\n\nIt is significantly more difficult for my daughter to successfully get a liver transplant from a living person, said Ncube. My daughter has a reasonable apprehension of imminent death because she has been denied a liver transplant from a deceased donor.\n\nThe familys legal team is asking the court to stop what they describe as discriminatory and unconstitutional practices in South Africas public healthcare system. Human rights lawyer Advocate Simba Chitando, who is representing the family, did not mince words.\n\nThis matter is urgent because it is a life-saving procedure, but it is also one of the most cruel, inhuman, and blatantly xenophobic acts perpetuated by the state against a child, said Chitando. South Africa has lost its moral, legal, and pan-African compass.\n\nChitando says the case is about more than one childs lifeits about systemic discrimination. My clients remain defiant under the circumstances, and the legal team Im leading will do everything in our power to save this beautiful Zimbabwean girls life.\n\nThe hospital and government officials named in the application have not responded to media queries, despite several attempts for comment this week.\n\nMeanwhile, the cost of undergoing a transplant privately remains far out of reach. A liver transplant at the Wits Donald Gordon Medical Centre under the non-standard service category is priced at just under R1.75 millionan impossible figure for the Mafu family.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFORMER Harare City Council mayor Bernard Manyenyeni and former acting town clerk Josephine Ncube were remanded out of custody after being dragged to court on allegations of abusing their roles and prejudicing the local authority of US$20 million in the process.\n\nIssues of bail did not arise because they were coming from home.\n\nThey were remanded to May 14 following their brief appearance before magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa.\n\nAccording to court papers sometime in 2013, Shelter Incorporated Private Limited trading as Shelter Zimbabwe applied for a joint venture partnership with City of Harare to service and develop residential stands in Donnybrooke Mabvuku indicating that it had financial capacity to service the stands.\n\nThe court heard on 14 May 2013, a meeting was held by the Education, Health, Housing and Community services committee, and the committee resolved to recommend that council approves the servicing and development of 1500 residential stands in Mabvuku.\n\nOn 4 June 2013 the full council adopted the recommendation from the above committees during the 1828st ordinary council meeting under item & of the minutes, resulting in city of Harare entering into a Memorandum of Agreement with Shelter Zimbabwe, in which Harare provided land approximately 657 hectares depicted under TPY/ER/01/13 in Tafara to Shelter Zimbabwe to fully service the Land providing onsite and off-site infrastructure on 1,500 residential stands within a period of two years, which extended from the 15th of October 2016 to the 15th of October 2018.\n\nThe allocation of residential stands was to be done through the City of Harare housing waiting list and Shelter Zimbabwe was going to recover its development cost from the individuals allocated through City of Harare housing waiting list in accordance with section 7.1 of the MoA. Shelter Zimbabwe was to commence work within six months, the State led by Rufaro Chonzi alleges.\n\nFive months lapsed and Shelter Zimbabwe did not commence the work, no development was done on site, and instead in February 2017 Shelter Zimbabwe (Pvt) Ltd wrote a letter to the city of Harare seeking to sell the residential stands, reads court papers.\n\nIt is further alleged that Shelter Zimbabwes request was denied by the then Housing director Mathew Marara as their request amounted to a breach of contract.\n\nOn 15 September 2017, without seeking Council approval accused one and two , amended section 7.1 of the MoA through an addendum and mandated Shelter Zimbabwe to allocate and sell un-serviced stands knowingly that a council resolution was needed to amend the MoA on behalf of the City of Harare.\n\nDue to the actions of the accused persons, Shelter Zimbabwe proceeded to sell residential stands which they were not supposed to sell according to the initial MoA. However, Shelter Zimbabwe has not yet developed the land despite the fact that it sold the stands and received the money.\n\nAccused persons by virtue of their offices as public officers and in the exercise of their duties did acts that were contrary to their duties as public officers by disregarding council approval and mandating Shelter Zimbabwe to sell and allocate un-serviced stands, resulting in the project now being funded by prospective beneficiaries.\n\nThe value of the whole project is US$ 20 million with the stands being sold at an average of US$15 000, the court heard.\n\n",
