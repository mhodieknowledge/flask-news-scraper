The lack of adherence to these procedural safeguards rendered the previous judgments ineffective and void.\n\nMugabe, appointed bursar on a fixed-term contract from July 2017 to June 2021, was dismissed following clashes with university management. A labour officer later awarded him US$323,036 for unfair dismissal, a ruling UZ unsuccessfully appealed.\n\nRepresenting Mugabe, attorney Tawanda Zhuwarara said the earlier rulings violated fundamental rights enshrined in sections 56 and 71 of the Constitution, adding that the Supreme Courts decision was an arbitrary deprivation of property.\n\nUZs lawyer, G. Madzoka, countered that the application was nothing more than a disguised appeal, arguing that the underlying issues had already been settled.\n\nJustice Rita Makarau noted the unacceptable failure by lower courts to address preliminary points vital to fairness.\n\nDeclaring both earlier rulings void, the Court found the proceedings fraught with irregularities.\n\n",

There are people talking on his behalf, the Bombshell Gezas, but Chiwenga has not publicly expressed interest in higher office.\n\nHowever, from experience, we know that during the turbulence at the end of Robert Mugabes rule, Mnangagwa never openly declared his ambitions to succeed Mugabe. He kept quiet and did most of his machinations behind the scenes.\n\nSo we might be hearing a lot of noise about the Chiwenga faction, but we do not know what is happening in the background. His silence says a lot because it would be unwise for him to speak openly about it now, whatever plans he may have. But from where I stand, given the mandate and legitimacy Mnangagwa enjoys within Zanu PF, it would take a miracle for Chiwenga to recover from this, said Ngwenya.\n\nZanu PF is reportedly preparing a constitutional amendment in Parliament to allow President Mnangagwa to remain in power beyond the 2028 elections.\n\nHowever, the ruling party faces major legal hurdles, including Section 91(2), which bars a president from seeking a third term, and Section 328(7), which prohibits an incumbent from benefiting from a constitutional amendment enacted during their tenure.\n\nA leaked dossier, allegedly authored by Chiwenga, claims that Zanu PF intends to smuggle a document titled Breaking Barriers Initiative (BBI) into Parliament to suspend elections and extend both the presidents and the legislatures terms.\n\nNgwenya, however, dismissed the documents credibility, which is said to be linked to self-imposed CCC Secretary General, Sengezo Tshabangu.\n\nBBI is moribund because it tinkers with the illusion that you can simply change the constitution to achieve anything. My assumption is that not everyone within Zanu PF supports this agenda.\n\nThey might not say it publicly, but its nave to assume that if this matter goes to Parliament, it would automatically pass. BBI is just an academic document, Ngwenya said.\n\n",

            "content": "Music in Africa\n\nTheZimbabwe Musicians Union(ZIMU) has called for an immediate review of the 2024 audit report of theZimbabwe Music Rights Association(ZIMURA), citing alleged governance failures, misrepresentation, and breaches of corporate protocol.\n\nIn an open letter dated 19 October 2025 addressed to Baker Tilly Chartered Accountants, ZIMURAs auditors, ZIMU presidentEdith Katijiaccused the firm of overlooking several procedural and ethical irregularities in its audit of the music rights body. The letter was also copied to the Companies and Intellectual Property Office (CIPZ), the Ministry of Sport, Recreation, Arts and Culture, and the National Arts Council of Zimbabwe (NACZ).\n\nQuestions over audit validity\n\nKatiji claimed that ZIMURAs 2024 audited financial statements failed to comply with the organisations Articles of Association. She said the report was signed by only two individuals, board chairpersonAlbert Nyathiand executive director Polisile Ncube-Chimhini, without the mandatory third signature from the company secretary. According to Section 59 of the Articles of Association, the company seal must be accompanied by two directors signatures and that of the secretary.\n\nZIMU further argued that the document was invalid because Ncube-Chimhini allegedly signed under a title that does not exist in ZIMURAs governance structure. The letter cited a High Court ruling in Farai Fred Nyakudanga v Polisile Ncube-Chimhini (HH 438-25), which found that she does not hold the position of executive director.\n\nAlleged omission of material facts\n\nKatiji criticised the auditors for failing to disclose Ncube-Chimhinis reported fraud conviction, while noting that the audit made reference to unrelated legal cases such as Simbisa Brands Zimbabwe (Pvt) Ltd. She said the omission of information about the conviction undermined the integrity and transparency of the report.\n\nWhile every citizen has the right to appeal, the conviction stands until overturned, Katiji wrote. Responsible governance demands immediate suspension, not concealment or legitimisation.\n\nThe musicians body alleged that ZIMURA continues to face multiple governance and legal challenges, including police investigations into fraud and misappropriation of funds, as well as ongoing court cases involving board members. ZIMU said the auditors failure to reference these matters amounted to a serious breach of professional responsibility.\n\nThe letter also raised concerns about the accuracy of the directors list in the audit report, stating that it did not match official records lodged with the Deeds Office. It named Philip Chipfumbu as one of the directors omitted from the published list.\n\nAuditor independence questioned\n\nZIMU questioned Baker Tillys professional conduct, suggesting that the firm may have relied on information supplied by ZIMURAs management without independent verification. The union said the audit created confusion by alternately assigning responsibility for financial statements to both management and the board, which contradicts ZIMURAs Articles of Association.\n\nKatiji urged the audit firm to withhold the report from presentation at ZIMURAs Annual General Meeting (AGM) scheduled for 22 October 2025, warning that using the document to guide governance decisions would be reckless and a breach of ethical responsibilities.\n\nZIMU has requested an urgent reassessment of the 2024 audit, public disclosure of Ncube-Chimhinis legal status, and cooperation with regulatory authorities to restore transparency. The union also called for scrutiny of ZIMURAs legal adviser, Witness Zhangazha, who has reportedly been referred to the Law Society of Zimbabwe over alleged misconduct.\n\nKatiji said the credibility of both ZIMURA and Zimbabwes audit profession was at stake if the issues were not addressed.\n\nNeither ZIMURA nor Baker Tilly had issued a public response to the letter at the time of publication.\n\n",

In accordance with World Health Organisation (WHO) protocols, the detection of even a single confirmed case necessitates the declaration of an outbreak, prompting health authorities to launch an immediate response.\n\nThe MoHSS has assured the Namibian public that the countrys robust surveillance system is primed to identify and monitor individuals exhibiting signs of mpox. Additional cases are being actively sought, while health authorities in the Erongo region are closely monitoring the patients immediate contacts to prevent further spread of the virus.\n\nMpox is a zoonotic disease caused by an orthopox virus, resulting in smallpox-like symptoms in humans. This outbreak follows a concerning trend, as multiple countries within Africa, including the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Zambia, Malawi, and Tanzania, are reporting active mpox cases.\n\nMpox symptoms typically manifest after an incubation period ranging from 5 to 21 days and can include:\n\nThe rash often appears on the face, palms, and soles of the feet, and can also affect the mouth, genitals, and eyes. Symptoms generally last from two to four weeks, during which the infected individuals are capable of transmitting the virus to others.\n\nHuman-to-human transmission occurs primarily through direct contact with respiratory secretions, bodily fluids, or skin lesions of an infected person. The MoHSS outlines several potential avenues for transmission, including:\n\nAs mpox can affect anyone regardless of demographic, the MoHSS urges the public to take preventive measures. These include:\n\nIn light of this outbreak, the MoHSS has mobilised necessary resources to respond effectively, emphasising the importance of public cooperation.

The company said the find aligns with its strategy to maximise gold production through modern, mechanised mining and processing methods.\n\nA preliminary JORC-compliant Mineral Resource Estimation has exceeded expectations, prompting Kavango to consider constructing an upgraded 300-tonne-per-day gold processing plant at the Bills Luck Gold Mine, up from the originally planned 200 tpd capacity.\n\nKavango Resources CEO Ben Turney described the discovery as a landmark achievement for the company.\n\nThis maiden JORC resource at Nightshift is a defining moment for Kavango. It proves that our gold development strategy in Zimbabwe is working and that our decision to focus on near-surface, fast-track production targets is delivering results, he said.\n\nTurney added that when the company began exploration at Hillside in mid-2023, its goal was to identify deposits that could fast-track gold production using advanced mining and processing methods.\n\nThis is a fantastic accomplishment by our team, who deserve all the praise for the hard work they have put into making this happen. Our initial drilling covered only about 15% of the known 700-metre strike, and just 50m vertical depth, because we were focused on defining a starter resource to underpin early cash flow and prove the concept.\n\nThe fact that the results have exceeded expectations at this stage gives us strong confidence in the greater potential of Nightshift. Given we encountered gold-bearing structures >200m vertical below surface during exploration, we are particularly excited for the underground mining possibilities here, added Turney.\n\n",

Sikandar Raza (3-30), Newman Nyamhuri (3-42) and Blessing Muzarabani (2-56) were the major stars with the ball as Afghanistan folded for a paltry total of 157. In reply, Zimbabwes opening pair of Ben Curran and Joylord Gumbie negotiated three overs before bad light forced slightly early stumps with Zimbabwe at 6/0. It capped a strong start to the game for the hosts who won a good toss earlier in the morning.\n\nIncessant rains and then wet outfield meant that the first session was entirely lost and Zimbabwes captain Craig Ervine had no hesitation to bowl on winning the toss. After a slightly erratic start with the new ball, the Zimbabwe pacers got their radar right on a pitch that had life in it. Extra bounce was on offer and some seam movement as well, although not as extravagant as generally seen at this venue. Abdul Malik and debutant Riaz Hassan weathered the early storm but both fell in quick succession once Zimbabwes new-ball pairing hit their straps.\n\nIt was, however, a run out that gave Zimbabwe the first breakthrough as Hassan fell to a direct hit from Brian Bennett. It was just the tonic the home side needed and Nyamhuri then got Malik caught behind to give Zimbabwe further momentum in the afternoon session. Rahmat Shah and Hashmatullah Shahidi prevented further damage in the session but Zimbabwe continued to make inroads after tea. The impressive Nyamhuri broke the partnership between last games heroes Rahmat and Shahidi but getting the skipper LBW. Raza then got into the act to castle Rahmat as Afghanistan continued to slip away.\n\nOnce Rahmat fell, it was a procession for the visitors as Raza and Muzarabani sliced through the lower order. If not for comeback man Rashid Khans 20-ball 25, the total would have been much lesser. Even with the tricky nature of the pitch, the Afghanistan were easily about 50-60 runs short although the pitch cannot be judged till both sides bat on it.\n\nBrief scores:Afghanistan 157 (Sikandar Raza 3-30, Newman Nyamhuri 3-30) vs Zimbabwe 6/0\n\n",
