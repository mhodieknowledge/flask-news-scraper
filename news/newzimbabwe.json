            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nHARARE City Council (HCC) workers have downed tools in protest against poor welfare conditions and non-payment of salaries, adding to the municipalitys growing challenges.\n\nThe workers have not been paid for two months, and the council has failed to honour its promise to pay them on time.\n\nTheir situation has been worsened by the ongoing economic difficulties, which have significantly eroded the value of their yet-to-be-paid salaries due to inflation.\n\nIn a letter addressed to HCCs senior officials, the Zimbabwe Municipalities Nurses and Allied Workers Union (ZIMNAWU) president Simbarashe Tafirenyika expressed concerns over the councils delays in paying its workers, which has led to severe financial strain.\n\nThis unacceptable situation has drastically impacted workers livelihoods, working conditions, and overall well-being. The delay in salary payments has caused financial hardship and discontent, as salaries are being eroded by inflation.\n\nThis has left our members incapacitated, which in turn affects service delivery. We urge the City of Harare to address these delays and ensure that workers are paid on time. Please note that employees have not been paid for December 2024 or January 2025, and February is already approaching.\n\nAccording to Statutory Instrument 13 of 2015, workers should be paid by the 28th of each month. We urge your office not to stagger salary payments and to pay all workers at once, as the current situation is causing disharmony in the workforce due to the instability of our local currency, read the letter.\n\nRELATED:\n\nThe workers grievances come amid an ongoing investigation by a Commission of Inquiry set up by President Emmerson Mnangagwa to examine operations at the Town House.\n\nThe Commission has uncovered widespread corruption within the City Council, with senior officials allegedly using it as a source of personal enrichment, which has negatively impacted service delivery in the capital.\n\nZIMNAWU further announced that its members would limit their working hours to two or three days per week to pressure the employer into addressing their concerns.\n\nIn light of the current situation, we have no choice but to declare that our members will only work two to three days per week until the employer resumes timely salary payments.\n\nThis decision is meant to safeguard the health, safety, and welfare of our employees, who can no longer afford to work under conditions that compromise their dignity and well-being, the letter concluded.\n\n",

The Stade de Reims midfielder, a real pillar of the Champagne club since his arrival in 2019 from Orlando Pirates with 21 goals and 14 assists in 159 matches played. A nice total for the midfielder who is very forward-oriented and also very committed to his country. In May 2023, during his extension, his club had committed to including an original clause in his contract, which promised the payment of 100 euros to his foundation, for each kilometer traveled in a match, which raised more than 30,000 for his eponymous foundation working to educate children in Zimbabwe,\n\nWolverhampton, who are looking to strengthen their midfield to get out of the Premier Leagues depths, are looking to complete the transfer by tonight and the end of the transfer window. To force Stade de Reims to give in, a very large sum, probably in the same range as that paid for Agbadou, has been put on the table. According to our information, discussions are underway between the two teams and Reims could see their best player leave Champagne this Monday.
