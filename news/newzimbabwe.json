            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nTHE government has pledged more land to the Urban Development Corporation (UDCORP) after the parastatal completed a successful, profitable transformation strategy.\n\nDuring a tour of Knockmallock Mixed Housing Project in Chegutu last FrIday, stakeholders had the opportunity to ask questions and get full details of the project, which will benefit both the low-income earners, middle class and the bourgeoisie.\n\nThe project, under a developmental initiative partnering Chegutu Rural District Council, UDCORPs Knockmallock Mixed Housing Project is a self-contained project with residential stands, commercial stands, a light industrial park, and institutional stands such as schools, churches, cemetery and others.\n\nLocal Government Minister, Daniel Garwe, in a speech read on his behalf by the Chief Director of Spatial Planning and Development in the ministry, Shingirayi Mushamba said UDCORP is strategically positioned to play a leading role in the governments Call to Action  No Compromise to Service Delivery.\n\nMushamba confirmed that the ministry would allocate more land to UDCORP to empower its national development role.\n\nUDCORP Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Joy Shumbamhini, addressing stakeholders, said the transformation journey began on April 7, 2023, when the UDCORP board approved a very ambitious transformation strategy to turn around its fortunes.\n\nUDCORPs brand had gone bad and was associated with bad things, but we have invited you today to witness a new UDCORP.\n\nToday I stand before you to reflect a profound strategic journey of transformation, resilience, and tangible progress, because we are talking in the office where we are doing this project, and we wanted you to come and see for yourself the work that is being done in the creation of a new setup, Shumbamhini said.\n\nIn 2023, UDCORP launched a transformation journey, naming it Transformation Restore UDCORP Prosperity.\n\nOur first part of the transformation journey was to put our house in order, and amongst our 10 objectives was to turn around UDCORP from a loss-making to a profit-making organisation.\n\nThe corporation was making losses for years, and it was not sustainable. The second objective was to mobilise resources from the private sector, local and regional financial institutions. The third objective is to unlock the UDCORP land bank and resuscitate project works, Shumbamhini added.\n\nHe said UDCORP was currently working on creating effective and efficient internal governance systems, policies, processes, procedures in administration systems and also in the process of reviewing the UDCORP business model and implementation of the new business model.\n\nThe parastatal managed to clear its backlog in terms of annual general meetings.The corporation had gone for a number of years without presenting annual audited financial statements to stakeholders.\n\nWe have cleared the backlog in audited financial statements and annual general meetings dating as far back as 2020. And the corporation is now up to date. Our corporate governance compliance is sold to 96%.\n\nThe parastatal also managed to reduce the project costs by at least USD$8 million from US$40 million to USD$22 million.\n\nUDCORP has another project in Manresa, a block of high-rise flats, where four blocks were constructed and now transferred to the National Housing ministry for completion at the allocation to civil servants.\n\nUnfortunately, the Manresa project stalled as UDCORPs capital was wiped out due to currency changes and inflation.\n\nWe successfully resuscitated the Knockmallock Housing Project in July 2024. This was not a simple task. It required strategic focus and diligence.\n\nToday, we celebrate the successful resuscitation of a flexion housing project, the Knockmallock Mixed Housing Project. This project falls under the Chegutu Rural District Council. And this is clear testimony that real artistic councils can also embrace rapid modernisation.\n\nAccording to Shumbamhini, phase one of the project is almost 90% complete, with 608 high-density residential stands.\n\nPhase one, extension, because we have realized that there is a huge demand for high-density stands, so we have to create additional extension for high-density, which is going to yield 1,263 high-density residential stands.\n\nPhase two is medium-density stands, which are going to yield 881 residential stands. Phase three is your low-density stands, that area of the mountain, the mountainous area, low-density stands with a beautiful scenery, and we are going to have about 398 low-density stands, said the CEO.\n\nThe project is self-funding with the resources that are being used to implement this project coming from individuals, corporates, and institutional investors such as pension funds\n\nWe are calling upon companies, pension funds, and institutional investors to approach UDCORP for public-private partnerships or commercial joint ventures in housing and infrastructure development.\n\nWe call upon rural district councils to emulate Chegutu RDC in undertaking such game-changing housing projects, said Shumbamhini.\n\nFully paid-up clients can immediately qualify to start applying for title deeds, giving them security of tenure.\n\nWe have already started the process of all fully paid-up members with check to load disposal and we appreciate check to load disposal for the work that theyre doing to assist our fully paid-up members.\n\nIn terms of progress on the ground, We can confirm that we have covered significant ground in doing sewer reticulation, water reticulation, and stormwater drains. The road servicing will be done soon after we finish our sewer and our water, and we want to make sure that we complete phase one by December 31, 2025.\n\nFor sewer treatment, the corporation has adopted a biodigester system. The tender for biodigesters has just been concluded, and the contractor is expected to commence project works in December 2025. And going forward, we are strengthening our research and development function in order for the corporation to become a pioneer in innovation and modern technologies in the built environment.\n\nUDCORPs focus is on social impact, making sure its pricing will be very reasonable and far lower than the private sector.\n\n",

            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo l IOL\n\nTHE National Democratic Working Group (NDWG) in Zimbabwe has denied that explosives allegedly found in opposition politician Job Wiwa Sikhalas vehicle during his arrest in Pretoria belonged to him, describing the incident as suspected foul play.\n\nIn a statement, the NDWG said Sikhala, who was arrested in Gauteng earlier this week, was subjected to what is believed to be suspected foul play when the vehicle he was travelling in was stopped and searched by members of the South African Police Service (SAPS).\n\nDuring the search, explosives were allegedly discovered in the vehicle. Honourable Sikhala was subsequently arrested and is currently detained at Pretoria central prison, the groups spokesperson Silenkosi Moyo said.\n\nThe NDWG said its legal team was actively engaged on-site to secure the opposition leaders defence.\n\nWe categorically maintain that the explosives found do not belong to him, the statement added.\n\nAs the National Democratic Working Group, we stand unwaveringly beside our leader and reaffirm our commitment to defending him through all legal means available.\n\nThe group appealed to the public to keep Sikhala in their thoughts and prayers during what it described as challenging times.\n\nSikhalas arrest in South Africa comes less than a year after his release from detention in Zimbabwe, where he was arrested for allegedly inciting public violence. Rights groups and opposition figures previously accused the Harare government of persecuting him for his political activism.\n\nSikhala remains one of the most vocal critics of Zanu PF, continuing to speak out against corruption and human rights abuses in Zimbabwe.\n\nHis latest arrest has sparked fresh concern among Zimbabweans in the diaspora and raised questions about the circumstances surrounding his detention in South Africa.\n\nOn the other hand, other sections of the Zimbabwean society accuse Sikhala of being involved in crime, and celebrated his arrest in Pretoria.\n\n",
