Some have questioned her seemingly anti-tolerant bashing of opposition leaders in the country despite claiming to be fighting for the same cause.\n\nChallenged by NewZimbabwe.com to come out clean on whether she is working hand-in-glove with the ruling party on the sidelines of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) organised Workers Day commemorations at Dzivarasekwa Stadium Thursday, Masarira dismissed the suspicions.\n\nYou know what? A lot of people dont understand the type of politics I am pursuing. Im a unifier. Im a States Woman. I believe in unity of people, unity in our diversity. Right now, Ive been advocating for healthcare reform. Ive been advocating for a health revolution but some people want to politicise them, she said.\n\nMasarira said what people should understand is that when one gets sick, they go to Parirenyatwa, United Bulawayo Hospitals (UBH) or Mpilo Hospital, where no one asks for their political party affiliation or political party card.\n\nShe implored Zimbabweans to shake off political jackets and the binary optics of politics that we have and converge on issues of national interest.\n\nI do not thrive on politics of patronage but on issues that affect every Zimbabwean, regardless of their political party affiliation.\n\nSo, going forward, as I embark on my political journey, I shall need votes from Zanu PF people, I shall need votes from every other ordinary Zimbabwean. I do not participate in politics of hate, in politics of toxicity, in politics of insults, she added.\n\n",

            "content": "South Africas Social Security Agency (SASSA) provides financial assistance to citizens and qualifying residents through various grant programs. These include child support grants, disability grants, old age pensions, and more. But a common question that arises especially among migrants is: Can Zimbabwean immigrants avail SASSA grants?\n\nThis article aims to provide a clear, updated, and SEO-friendly explanation of whether Zimbabwean nationals living in South Africa are eligible for SASSA grants, what types of permits are required, and what alternatives are available for those who are not eligible.\n\nThe South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) is responsible for distributing social grants to help vulnerable individuals and families meet their basic needs. Grants include:\n\nThese grants are primarily meant for South African citizens, but certain categories of non-citizens may also qualify.\n\nCan Zimbabwean Immigrants Qualify for SASSA Grants?\n\nThe short answer is: Not all Zimbabwean immigrants are eligible for SASSA grants, but some may qualify under specific conditions. You can alsoCheck Sassa Statusfor eligibility.\n\nTo qualify for most SASSA grants, an applicant must meet the following criteria:\n\nZimbabwean immigrants in South Africa fall into different legal categories. Heres how that affects their SASSA eligibility:\n\nZimbabweans who have been granted refugee status (under Section 24 of the Refugees Act) are eligible for most SASSA grants. Refugees are treated the same as citizens under South African law for social security purposes.\n\nZEP holders are not eligible for SASSA grants. This is because the ZEP is a special temporary permit that does not confer permanent residency or refugee status.\n\nEven if a ZEP holder lives and works in South Africa legally, they do not meet the criteria for social grants.\n\nAsylum seekers holding Section 22 permits are also not eligible for most SASSA grants. This is because their status is temporary, and their applications for refugee status are still being processed.\n\nIf a Zimbabwean has been granted permanent residency, they become eligible to apply for SASSA grants, just like South African citizens. However, permanent residency is a long and complex process.\n\nSASSA Grants Zimbabweans May Qualify For\n\nHere are some grants that Zimbabwean immigrantsmayaccess under certain conditions:\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the SRD grant (R350 grant) was introduced. Initially, it was only for South African citizens, but later expanded to include refugees and asylum seekers with valid documentation from Home Affairs.\n\nWhile this grant was temporary, the SRD R370 grant has replaced it. As of 2024, it is still limited to:\n\nZimbabwean refugees or permanent residents with children may apply for the Child Support Grant, provided:\n\nIf a Zimbabwean refugee or permanent resident wants to apply for a SASSA grant, they will need:\n\nOnly recognized refugees and permanent residents can receive grantsnot all immigrants.\n\nThe ZEP (Zimbabwean Exemption Permit) is not equivalent to permanent residency and does not make the holder eligible for SASSA grants.\n\nSince Zimbabwean Exemption Permit holders are not eligible for SASSA grants, here are a few alternatives:\n\nOrganizations likeDoctors Without Borders (MSF),Scalabrini Centre, andGift of the Giversprovide food, housing, and basic needs support to migrants in need.\n\nZEP holders are legally allowed to work in South Africa. Seeking employment or freelance opportunities can help sustain financial needs.\n\nSome Zimbabwean community associations and churches in South Africa provide assistance to struggling families.\n\nNo. Work permits, including the Zimbabwean Exemption Permit (ZEP), do not qualify you for SASSA grants.\n\nOnly if they areSouth African citizensorrefugees. Children born to ZEP holders are not automatically granted citizenship.\n\nCan asylum seekers from Zimbabwe apply for the R370 grant?\n\nOnly under special temporary rulings. Most are not eligible unless otherwise stated by SASSA or government policy.\n\nWhile Zimbabwean immigrants contribute significantly to South African society, their eligibility for SASSA grants is limited. Only those with refugee status or permanent residency may legally access these social welfare benefits. ZEP holders and asylum seekers remain excluded, though they may access help through NGOs and community support networks.\n\nIf youre unsure about your status or rights, consult with legal aid organizations or visit your local SASSA office for accurate guidance.\n\n",

Mnangagwa, who is currently serving his final term, insists he is a constitutionalist and will step aside in 2028.\n\nAt the height of the calls, another faction resisting the proposal fronted by war vet Blessed Geza is backing Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, the favourite to take over from Mnangagwa. Geza has since called for demonstrations and an indefinite stay-away, which was recently ignored by citizens hard-hit by poverty and cannot afford to stay at home in a highly informal Zimbabwe\n\nSpeaking to NewZimbabwe.com on the sidelines of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU) organised Workers Day Commemorations Thursday, Mwonzora criticised forces angled towards extending Mnangagwas term of office.\n\nOpposition MDC leader Douglas Mwonzora\n\nWe are totally opposed to the issue of the third term. We must stick to the Constitution, which says the President must serve for a maximum of 10 years. President Mnangagwa must be even more grateful for the fact that he has been in the Cabinet since 1980.\n\nApart from that, on expiry of his current term, he would have served in office for a good 11 years, because he completed one year that was left by the former late president.\n\nIn the event that he faces no resistance to amending the constitution for a third term. It means we have to conduct two referendums, and a referendum is an election that will cost US$ 20 million each. There is no need for that, he said.\n\nAsked whether he was considering backing Gezas demonstrations to align with the anti-third term agenda, Mwonzora rubbished the war vets efforts, saying supporting such an initiative will only perpetuate Zanu-PFs hold on power.\n\nHe said MDCs agenda has nothing to do with changing the leader of ZANU-PF midway.\n\nAdded Mwonzora, That is not for us to say, because we are wiser(3:29)to know that if we are to change the president of ZANU-PF today, he will be replaced by a(3:36)president of ZANU-PF. So there will not be any change of government, which is what we(3:41)want as the opposition.\n\nWe want a change of government. So the internal views within ZANU-PFare not for us. But where we agree with him and other people is that there should not be a third term. But on the issue of whether they want to change their president, its up to them as ZANU-PF.\n\n",

The ERC is concerned that limited time away from work on election days may inadvertently infringe upon workers voting rights.\n\nThe ERC emphasises the active inclusion of workers, a significant group, in this vision of participatory democracy.\n\nIn Zimbabwes 2023 general elections, some working-class citizens were unable to vote due to the limited time allocated for casting their ballots.\n\nVoting was delayed, particularly in Harare, where most polling stations failed to open on the first day.\n\nAs a result, many workers could not return to vote the following day because they did not have leave days available.\n\nERC emphasised that workers active inclusion is vital to participatory democracy.\n\nTherefore, the ERC calls on the relevant authorities across Africa, including Election Management Bodies (EMBs), Parliaments, and Ministries responsible for Justice and Elections, to proactively address this challenge.\n\nWe urge these bodies to review existing legislation and/or enact new regulations to effectively safeguard the rights of workers to vote on election days, ERC said.\n\nThe elections watchdog also called for a review of the definition of persons who may vote by post or through special voting mechanisms in the relevant Electoral Acts.\n\nIt also suggested the revision of electoral laws to expand early voting access for groups such as people with disabilities, senior citizens, and expectant mothers, while calling for consideration of early voting as an alternative to proxy voting and sought to include voters such as polling personnel and essential service workers.\n\n",

            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nThe Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) Zimbabwe has urged the Zimbabwean government to shelve the new Broadcasting Services Bill and allow a national forum to reconsider its nature, warning that if it is signed into law in its current form, it will set Zimbabwe back.\n\nAddressing delegates at the pre-commemorations of World Press Freedom Day in Harare on Wednesday, MISA Zimbabwe director Thabani Moyo appealed to the Ministry of Information to consider withdrawing the Bill from the Presidents Office, citing a number of concerns.\n\nWhat we are proposing is that the Ministry rethinks the matter at ministerial level and actually recalls the Bill. At the Presidents Office level, to send it back to the ministry, at the stakeholder level, to organise the best minds to come together. At national level, to get that dialogue going through a step-by-step process of reimagining broadcasting services in Zimbabwe, he said.\n\nMoyo argued that the Bill failed to reflect the contributions made by Zimbabweans during public consultations across the country and that it did not appreciate the impact of emerging technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence, on the global broadcasting industry.\n\nHe also voiced concerns about the scrapping of the 40 percent foreign ownership cap on broadcasting institutions, which had been included in the draft bill with the aim of boosting foreign direct investment.\n\nThe Bill did not factor in the bulk of the contributions that were proffered in the consultative meetings held from 16 to 21 December 2025. According to the parliamentary report, 485 Zimbabweans contributed as provided for under section 141 of the Constitution.\n\nThe essence of taking parliament to the people is to put the people at the centre of law-making, and when the people make submissions, it is only fair that they are reflected in the Bill. Members of Parliament across the board made similar submissions in Parliament but were also equally ignored.\n\nThe Bill is actually regressing in terms of foreign direct investment. The draft proposed 40 percent, and now it is going backwards. Even 40 percent was a struggle to push for, and we are now going backwards. Broadcasting by its nature is capital intensive, he added.\n\nOne of the key bones of contention that emerged during public meetings on the new Broadcasting Services Amendment Bill was clause 15, which links ZINARA vehicle licensing to ZBC radio licensing. According to the parliamentary report from the public hearings, many participants described this particular linkage as discriminatory and unfair to motorists.\n\nThe main grievance was that motorists should not be forced to pay ZBC radio licenses when anyone can access the same services using other digital gadgets, like mobile phones, without necessarily having a vehicle.\n\nParliamentarians across the political spectrum also debated in vain against combining ZINARA vehicle licensing and ZBC radio licensing.\n\nAt one point, while debating the Bill in Parliament, the Zanu PF secretary for local government and Member of Parliament Supa Mandiwanzira warned that the linkage of vehicle licensing and ZBC Television and Radio licensing was equal to throwing the cat among the pigeons.\n\nIn response to MISA, Director for International Communication Services in the Ministry of Information, Richard Mahomva, urged MISA to put its proposal in black and white and engage the ministry for a response.\n\nMahomva was representing the Minister of Information, Jenfan Muswere, at the event.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nOPPOSITION politician Nelson Chamisa has bemoaned the meagre salaries given to university lecturers, vowing to prioritise workers issues once he takes charge.\n\nUniversity of Zimbabwe (UZ) lecturers have downed tools demanding a decent salary. A junior lecturer is taking home as little as $230 a month, which is not enough to cater for basic needs.\n\nPoor remuneration is not only in the lecturers fraternity, as many of the countrys professionals are earning not more than US$300 per month.\n\nIn a statement to officially mark the 2025 Workers Day commemorations, Chamisa described Zimbabwe as a country without work for many and hailed the countrys citizens for their resilience.\n\nWorkers have been plunged into slavery. Many workers are earning extremely low wages, rendering them working poor, basically putting them in the poverty bracket. Our teachers and nurses are suffering. The civil servants are struggling. Workers in general are without a decent living wage. University lecturers, who are currently on strike, are earning a paltry salary, an embarrassing $228 per month.\n\nMany workers have lost their pensions and face a difficult retirement future. Zimbabwean workers literally live, work and retire in poverty, Chamisa said.\n\nHe added that due to high unemployment and lack of government protection, many workers are stripped of their rights and freedoms, pushingmany into survivalist informal employment without social security, income security or other labour rights.\n\nThe level of poverty in the working class, Chamisa said, has driven many professionals to seek better opportunities outside the country.\n\nThe Next Government, our new government, will focus on restoring the dignity of workers and the strengthening of genuine social dialogue as a means of addressing the multiple problems that workers are facing.\n\nWe will prioritise rebuilding the economy and public services in order to create employment opportunities for the many unemployed young Zimbabweans. We will end casualisation of jobs and stop job losses and retrenchments. Labour laws and practices shall be reformed in order to strengthen protection of freedom of association, expression and collective bargaining, added Chamisa.\n\n",

But I know they wont kill me because I have the Bible in my phone and another one under my pillow, Were said at the time.\n\nOn Thursday, homicide detectives visited the scene with Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen saying that investigations have advanced.\n\nWere was serving his second term in parliament as a member of the Orange Democratic Movement, led by veteran politician Raila Odinga.\n\nIn his statement, Odinga condemned the killing, saying the legislator was mercilessly and in cold blood, gunned down by an assassin.\n\nWe have lost a gallant son of the soil! Odinga added.\n\nOdinga lost to President Ruto in the 2022 election and rejected the results due to alleged irregularities.\n\nThe former prime minister has since struck a political deal with Ruto which saw some opposition members join cabinet in what is referred as the broad-based government  which Were supported.\n\n",
