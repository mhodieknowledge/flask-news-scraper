            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has advised convicted criminals to stop raising HIV as a special circumstance during mitigation because the infection is no longer deadly due to advancements in its treatment.\n\nJudges of appeal Justices Munamato Mutevedzi and Naison Chivayo said this while handing down their ruling on an appeal by two convicts who were convicted for unlawful possession of ivory tusks.\n\nBoth convicts whose identity is being withheld because of their HIV status were jailed for 11 and nine years minimum mandatory sentences respectively for the offence.\n\nOne of them was jailed 11 years after it emerged that he was a serial offender.\n\nThey both raised their positive HIV status as a mitigatory factor while seeking a lenient sentence.\n\nThe court said being infected with HIV was not a special circumstance.\n\nThey were general items of mitigation which this court in previous pronouncements has ruled as not constituting special circumstances even when taken cumulatively.\n\nBut perhaps what needs special mention among those is the submission by both appellants that they were infected with HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.\n\nWe were not sure what they wanted to achieve from that, said the judges.\n\nMuch as being HIV positive used to be scary and was viewed by many as terminal, it is a notorious fact, which the court will take judicial notice of, that this is no longer the case.\n\nMany forms of treatment have been developed over the years to mitigate the effects of HIV on humans.\n\nDr Amos had the following to say regarding the previously catastrophic effects of the condition: Treatments used, mean people living with HIV live long and healthy lives because the virus is controlled and its effects on someones health are limited.\n\nThe treatment also brings the level of virus in the body of someone living with HIV down to such low levels that it cant be detected by HIV tests  and this also means that it cant be passed on to someones sexual partners, whether they use condoms or not.\n\nThe judges said in Zimbabwes case, as far back as 1993 when being infected with HIV was still viewed as a death penalty, the High Court in the case of S v Mahachi (1993 2 SACR 36 (Z)), rejected the notion of treating those with HIV as a special category of offenders.\n\nIn its final determination, it held further that because the accused it was sentencing had previous convictions, his state of health was not decisive. It sentenced him to imprisonment regardless of his HIV condition.\n\nI also wish to add that the effects of HIV have since been downgraded to the levels of any other disease and conditions like the common colds, diabetes, and hypertension among others.\n\nIn fact, it is a fact that there are more deadly infections and diseases than HIV.\n\nIt is time therefore that people accused of crime must stop seeking special sentences in the guise of their HIV statuses because their conditions are no different from other illnesses.\n\nThe courts will view that as nothing but an abuse of ones medical condition.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, being HIV positive, like any other ailment, and without more is not a special circumstance warranting a court to depart from imposing a prescribed minimum sentence on an offender, said Mutevedzi.\n\nHe said the lower court was correct to impose the minimum mandatory eleven years on him regardless of his HIV condition.\n\nEqually the sentence of nine years imprisonment imposed on the second appellant was an appropriate one, they ruled.\n\n",

Test cricket was always big in Zimbabwe, but the country went through problems [in the mid-2000s], we didnt play for six years [2005-2011] and started again, Taibu toldSportsboom.com.\n\nZimbabwe has not gone down because they love Test cricket. You have youngsters who want to play Test cricket as a profession, knowing that the coaching will be expensive.\n\nTaibu who played 150 One-Day Internationals and 28 Tests for Zimbabwe, was, however, concerned about the development of cricket in the country.\n\nThe country has been going through economic problems. It plays a role in the development of any sport. I dont think the administrators have made a concerted effort to find new cricketers who are better than before. If you have 10,000 cricketers in the country, increasing the number to 15,000 increases your chances of quality.\n\nYou need to spread cricket to the rural areas; thats where most of the numbers are. You will find the guys scoring hundreds and taking fifers. You will feel like following those players to other games. While you are watching them, you may spot someone else. Then you put all the diamonds and gold in one place, and then only you can unearth someone like Andy Flower.\n\n",
