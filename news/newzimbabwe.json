            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nA Harare man, Mike Mupinga (40), was arrested by the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) and charged with culpable homicide after his pit bull mauled a man to death.\n\nThe incident took place Sunday morning in New Bluffhill, Harare, Ward 41.\n\nIn a statement posted on X today, the police confirmed that Mupinga, who is currently in custody, faces charges of culpable homicide.\n\nZRP Mabelreign arrested Mike Mupinga (40) in connection with a case of culpable homicide which occurred at the suspects residence in Mabelreign. The case stems from an incident where his pit-bull dogs allegedly attacked and mauled Samuel Machara (39) to death, the police said.\n\nMacharas body has been taken to Parirenyatwa Hospital for a postmortem examination.\n\nThe body of the victim was found near the suspects residence with dog bite wounds. The body was referred to the Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals mortuary for postmortem, added the police.\n\nWard 41 Councillor Kudzai Kadzombe emphasised that dog owners must keep their animals within their property, and that allowing dogs to roam freely is a clear breach of by-laws.\n\nKadzombe also pointed out that keeping more than two dogs in New Bluffhill and surrounding suburbs contravenes local regulations and could lead to imprisonment of up to six months.\n\nOwners are required to secure their properties with proper fencing or gates to prevent dogs from straying. Always keep dogs on a leash or under control when outside the property.\n\nProperties under 2,000 square metres (e.g., Warren Park, Westlea, Cranborne, Mabelreign, Arcadia, Mabvuku, Avondale): Maximum of 2 dogs.\n\nProperties 2,000 square metres or larger (e.g., Greystone Park, Shawasha Hills, Gletwin Park): Maximum of 4 dogs. Violating these regulations can result in a level three fine, imprisonment for up to six months, or both, she said.\n\nMupinga reportedly kept four dogs at his residence: two pit bulls, one Rottweiler, and an Angaran Mastiff.\n\n",

You can get scholarships to study in China, and also, with the rapidly growing Chinese economy, there is an opportunity for trade, so we can leverage the opportunity to create an amicable relationship between Zimbabwe and China, he said.Thandeka Risinamhodzi, a high school student from Harare, was elated to be crowned the champion in the high school students segment.Chinese is a very exciting language that you can learn. Learning Chinese benefits in many ways, like in Zimbabwe, most things involve the Chinese, like job opportunities, she said.Makoni and Risinamhodzi will represent Zimbabwe at the international finals of the Chinese Bridge competition in China later this year.In his address to the contest, Attwell Mamvuto, pro-vice-chancellor for academic affairs and administration at the University of Zimbabwe, said the competition not only celebrates linguistic excellence, but also marks the enduring friendship and cooperation between the two countries.Learning a new language opens doors to new opportunities, fosters understanding, and builds bridges between people from different backgrounds. The Chinese language, with its rich history and vast number of speakers, is a particularly valuable asset. It also augurs well with the University of Zimbabwes strategic thrust on the internationalization agenda as well as academic and cultural exchanges, he said.Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Zhou Ding said the growing number of Zimbabweans learning Chinese demonstrates the languages global prominence and the importance and vitality of the enduring partnership between China and Zimbabwe.This year, as we celebrate the 45th anniversary of China-Zimbabwe diplomatic relations, which are rooted in solidarity, shared aspiration, and mutual benefit, we also celebrate decades of our joint achievements, which include the robust educational and cultural collaboration between our two countries, Zhou added.\n\nDrawing participants from primary schools, high schools, and colleges, the competition consisted of a speech in Chinese and a talent show.\n\nKudakwashe Makoni, a student of political science and diplomacy at the University of Zimbabwe, stood out with his grasp of the Chinese language and knowledge of Chinese culture.He told Xinhua that the Chinese language serves not only as a practical skill to learn in a globalized world, but also as a bridge between the two countries.Learning Chinese provides huge opportunities for Zimbabweans.

One of them only identified as Mwazha offered Juruvenge US$100 as compensation for the inconveniences and he accepted it and went away.\n\nMwazha later proceeded to ZRP Ruwa and made a report of assault and theft against the now deceased CR 185/04/25 refers, reads the memo.\n\nOn May 27, 2025, around 1130 hours, the accused person number 078641D Constable Prince Ndavambi and Mwazha proceeded to the now deceaseds place of residence and arrested the now deceased.\n\nThey took him to Ruwa Police Station together with his sister Melisa Manyepa of Damafalls, Phase 1 whom they accused of harbouring the now deceased, the memo further reads.\n\nOn arrival at the police station, Ndavambi detained the now deceased under DB 460/25 and force-marched his sister to the back of the cabin and assaulted her on the knees using a wooden stick.\n\nThe accused person later took the now deceased from cells to the cabin where he assaulted him all over the body using a wooden stick. He ordered the now deceased and his sister to refund Mwazha his US$100.\n\nThe accused person threatened to kill the now deceased if he fails to refund the money. He also demanded another US$100 from the now deceased and his sister so that he can release them, police said in the memo.\n\nThe constable only stopped flogging Juruvenge after noticing he had become unconscious.\n\nUnperturbed, Ndavambi is said to have ordered Manyepa to contact her relatives to bring the money. She contacted her mother Elipa Jimu and others, who could not raise the required money.\n\nAccording to the police internal communication, the rogue cop then instructed a battered Juruvenge to stand up from where he was lying so that he shunts him into cells, but victim could not move. The police officer them pulled now deceased into the cell.\n\nAssailant later released victims sister to go and find money and she proceeded home. That evening, the accused called Manyepa asking her to bring food for the now deceased and she indicated that that she could not walk due to her knee injury as a result of the earlier beating.\n\nOn the same date at around 2130 hours, a cell check was conducted by the duty member, and he observed that the now deceased had difficulties in talking and breathing.\n\nAn entry was endorsed in the Occurrence Book entry number 3917/25. Officer in Charge ZRP Ruwa was advised through telephone and instructed the duty member to take the now deceased to hospital under police guard.\n\nThe now deceased was taken to Ruwa Rehabilitation Centre for medical attention where he was admitted.\n\nOn 28 May 2025 around 0615 hours, the now deceased passed away at Ruwa Rehabilitation Centre, reads the memorandum.\n\nThe informant reported the matter at ZRP Ruwa.

Investigations are in progress, the memo says.\n\nThe investigations are being done under ZRP Ruwa CR 379/5/25.\n\nAccording to the now deceaseds brother, Robson Juruvenge his family is devastated by the murder, which they feel someone is trying to cover up.\n\nAfter we contested the unconvincing results of the first postmortem results, we have been told another postmortem will be done on Monday.\n\nWe have been in talks with police Commissioner Mbiri of PGHQ (Police General Headquarters). Also, we have been summoned to Ruwa Police Station this Saturday, Robson told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nHe vowed the family will leave no stone unturned in a bid to unravel the truth surrounding his brothers gruesome killing at the hands of a rogue law enforcement officer.\n\n",
