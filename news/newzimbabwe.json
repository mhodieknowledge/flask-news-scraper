            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nBREAD prices are set to go up starting November 1, 2025, NewZimbabwe.com has learnt.\n\nThe increase comes as a result of a controversial Statutory Instrument (SI) 87 of 2025, which was gazetted by Industry and Commerce Minister Mangaliso Ndhlovu last month.The SI imposed a statutory payment into the Agriculture Revolving Fund on all millers, a move that they warned could result in negative inflationary pressures.Recommendations to set it aside were ignored.Failure to do so, as a result, is set to hike bread prices by not less than 4% on the retailers side according to the National Bakers Association of Zimbabwe (NBAZ) and Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ).Maize meal, stock feed, and other related products are likely to see prices go up.The NBAZ wishes to reiterate that the sector does not have capacity to take any increases in input costs, without compromising business viability, reads a letter to Ndhlovu from NBAZ, dated October 24, 2025.Bread flour accounts for approximately 43% of the total bread production cost, if a 4% increase in bread flour is permitted, it will translate to a 2 cents increase per cost of producing a loaf, resulting in an increase in the wholesale price of bread effective on the day on which the flour price is increased.The communicated increase in flour price, compounded with the other input cost escalations will result in an overall 5 cents per loaf pass-through effect to the retailer, most likely taking the retail price of bread, above the US$1 psychological benchmark, effective 1 November 2025.Despite fuel price increases, shortages of electricity and haphazard distribution, bread prices have remained at generally a dollar across the country.Their price hike could have a ripple effect whose inflationary impact might bring back memories of the late 2000s when prices changed by the hour.GMAZ, which according to another letter in NewZimbabwe.coms possession conceded defeat upon failure to scrap the SI, has already communicated the increase to the government.Regrettably, we have failed to successfully lobby for this SI to be reversed and have no option but to comply with it, reads a letter sent to Ndhlovu dated 23 October and copied to Lands and Agriculture Minister Anxious Masuka, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube, the presidents office, and the NBAZ.Accordingly, guided by the Audit Opinion we sought, we will be making provisions of the statutory payment imposed in our costings.Therefore, the price of bread flour (and other types of flour) will be increasing by circa 4% with effect from 1 November 2025.\n\nThe increase comes as a result of a controversial Statutory Instrument (SI) 87 of 2025, which was gazetted by Industry and Commerce

This will allow families to find closure as they now have the opportunity to bury their loved ones.\n\nSouth Africas Department of Transport has previously confirmed that the crash was caused by a combination of speeding, mechanical failure, and overloading.\n\nA preliminary report into the crash revealed that the bus was overloaded by 23 passengers, half of its brakes were defective, and the driver was travelling at an unsafe speed along a steep, winding mountain pass.\n\nTransport Minister Barbara Creecy and her deputy, Mkhuleko Hlengwa, have officially received the report, which was compiled by the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC).\n\nAccording to the RTMC, a major contributing factor was the drivers excessive speed for the conditions along the mountain descent.\n\n",

In the horticulture sector, the areas of interest include blueberries, chilies, avocados, and macadamia nuts, said Midzi.He noted that with Chinas zero-tariff policy for African exports, Zimbabwe aims to further tap into the Chinese market for locally produced goods.Looking at the Chinese market, we are also aiming to promote leather products, especially exotic leather. We are also looking to promote arts and crafts from Zimbabwe, the horticultural products, and the processed foods, said Midzi.Zimbabwe is additionally seeking to export heritage-based and value-added products such as baobab wine, baobab powder, and essential oils derived from indigenous resources.We have got baobab seed oil, we have got Marula oil, which are new products that are being developed in Zimbabwe, which we are looking to promote, and we believe the Chinese market is the right market, whether for further value additions into cosmeceuticals or even just consumption by the Chinese market, he said.As Zimbabwe works to strengthen its horticulture sector, businesses in blueberry production will be represented at the expo, following the signing of a blueberry export protocol during President Emmerson Mnangagwas visit to China in September.The protocol is only fairly new, but we are hoping to generate interest so that we can get information on potential buyers in China of blueberries so that we can bring back that information to the Zimbabwean growers and promote blueberry exports to China, said Midzi, adding that Zimbabwe is also pursuing export protocols for additional horticultural products, including citrus and avocados.\n\nKupakwashe Midzi, client advisor in the export development department at ZimTrade, Zimbabwes trade promotion agency, said about 15 companies from sectors including construction, horticulture, minerals, arts and crafts, and essential oils will participate in the expo, slated for Nov. 5 in Shanghai.\n\nWhat we are expecting to benefit from CIIE is getting more business deals, generating business leads, and getting businesses or companies in China that are interested in not only buying products from Zimbabwe, but also investing in the production of the products locally, said Midzi in a recent interview with Xinhua.He said the CIIE has, over the years, served as a key platform to showcase Zimbabwean products and expand their visibility in the vast Chinese market.We are looking forward to gaining a lot of traction from the Chinese businesses as well as potential buyers in what Zimbabwe has to offer.

Among the key creditors were ZESA Holdings, the National Social Security Authority (NSSA), and several urban councils in Bulawayo, Harare, and Chinhoyi.Speaking to the media last year, MIF CEO, John Mangudya explained the importance of working within the countrys legal framework.We are engaging with the creditors and the business practitioner to ensure that everything is done according to the law. After these discussions, well settle with the creditors and look at how best we can resuscitate CSC.The turnaround has now reached a major milestone. The long recovery process, which aimed to revive CSC and protect jobs, has seen significant progress, following years of financial strain that nearly led to the companys collapse. The latest notice, published over the weekend, confirms that the corporate rescue plan has been substantially implemented.In line with legal requirements, a notice was filed with the Master of the High Court, announcing that the corporate rescue plan for CSC, which was adopted by affected stakeholders on April 15, 2025, has now been successfully executed.The corporate rescue process for CSC officially ended on October 16, 2025, according to a statement from the outgoing corporate rescue practitioner, Crispen Mwete.Control of operations will now be handed back to the companys management and board, with all future inquiries directed to them, the notice stated.CSC has faced ongoing challenges in maintaining profitable operations and was on the brink of liquidation due to mounting debt and pressure from creditors.Factors such as financial mismanagement, allegations of corruption, and a deteriorating operational environment contributed to its insolvency, further complicated by a heightened risk profile that made it difficult to attract new investment or secure working capital.\n\nOver the past year, MIF has been at the forefront of a comprehensive effort to rehabilitate CSC, engaging with creditors and tackling a significant debt burden of approximately US$130 million.

Noor said the High Court, presided over by Justice Mandaza, had lifted the provisional order that had stopped Shuntai Investments (Pvt) Limited from proceeding with construction until all environmental and regulatory requirements were met.The High Court discharged the provisional order issued in March that suspended Shuntai from implementing the cement plant project until all the necessary documentation was in place and compliant, Noor said.Sadly, this latest ruling means that Shuntai continues as they have been doing all along.Bryden expressed frustration with EMAs decision to grant Shuntai an EIA certificate even as the school and nearby residents continued to raise red flags over toxic emissions, noise pollution, and the projects proximity to several educational institutions.We were assured by the EMA Board that Shuntai has been issued an EIA certificate with special conditions, Noor said.We have made several requests to EMA to disclose all of these special conditions. It is worth noting that the certificate can be removed at any time for non-compliance.The school insists that the EIA process was flawed and that the current certificate contradicts the actual activities taking place on the ground.We will still appeal to the Director General of EMA as there are serious discrepancies in the ESIA report, Noor stated.What is happening on the ground is not in keeping with the report on which the certificate was granted.Bryden says the EIA dispute has become the focal point of its ongoing legal and environmental campaign against Shuntai, accusing the regulator of rubber-stamping an assessment that ignored critical health, zoning, and safety concerns.The school has also appealed to the Minister of Environment and plans to escalate the matter to the Administrative Court. Noor said these efforts are aimed at protecting pupils from what the school describes as toxic dust, noxious fumes and blasting noise coming from the construction site.Despite the High Court setback, Noor assured parents that the school remains determined to fight on.We remain optimistic and continue to trust that Bryden will be safe, he said.We are grateful for all of the support we have received through this most trying time.He urged parents to sign its petition and contribute to a GoFundMe campaign to support the legal battle.The feud between the school, EMA and Shuntai has intensified since Shuntai defied an earlier March High Court order to stop work at its Eastbourne site.The school says heavy machinery, blasting and dust emissions have continued to threaten the health and safety of its pupils.There are serious discrepancies between what was approved and what is actually happening, Noor warned.We will not relent until the safety of Bryden children is guaranteed.\n\nEMA is accused of issuing an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report giving the project a greenlight despite strong environmental and health concerns from stakeholders, including the school.\n\nIn a letter to parents dated October 23, 2025, Brydens Board of Governors chairperson A.

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nGOVERNMENT has set aside nearly US$197,000 to cover the medical and repatriation costs for Zimbabwean victims of the Limpopo bus accident, which killed 44.\n\nThe victims, Zimbabweans and Malawians, were travelling back home when the DNC bus veered off the N1 North near Louis Trichardt on 13 October, killing 43 passengers and injuring 40 others, the victims. One more person succumbed to injuries in the hospital, bringing the death toll to 44.\n\n36 Zimbabweans died and 13 remain hospitalised in South Africa, with three in a critical condition.\n\nPreliminary investigations have revealed that the accident was due to brake failure and overloading of the bus, which was carrying 91 passengers with only a 62-seater capacity.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has since declared the bus accident a national disaster.\n\nPresenting a ministerial statement in the National Assembly recently, the Deputy Minister of Local Government and Public Works, Benjamin Kabikira, said the repatriation will be conducted in batches beginning on Friday.\n\nThe positive identification of all deceased was completed on the 20th of October, 2025, with the ZRP forensic team present to assist with the fingerprint screening and verification. In cases involving deceased children, DNA samples were collected from both the deceased and their next of kin for accurate identification.\n\nThen, on the death registration and documentation, all required documentation, including the death certificates and burial orders, are being processed to facilitate repatriation.\n\nThe repatriation to Zimbabwe is anticipated to begin in batches from Friday, 24th October 2025, pending the completion of all formal processes. A mass memorial service will be held in Beitbridge when the bodies arrive in Zimbabwe, said Kabikira.\n\nKabikira added that US$197,000 has been set aside to assist the victims.\n\nSecondly, we have dispatched a bus with next of kin or relatives from the National Disaster Management Centre, Harare, to the Beitbridge route to South Africa, for identification of the bodies. Zimbabwean nationals, that is next of kin without valid passports, were granted temporary passage into South Africa for the sole purpose of identifying the deceased.\n\nA list of names for the next of kin and national IDs was submitted to South African Immigration in advance to ensure smooth border processing. As a Ministry, post mortems were completed on Friday, the 17th of October, 2025 and the physical identification was also completed as of 20 October at Siloam Hospital.\n\nAs an intervention, the department of Civil Protection requested the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development and Zim Borders for a waiver of border charges for the hearses and bus carrying the bodies and families of the bereaved. The budget for intervention and coordination of the disaster is as follows: We are anticipating using a total amount of US$197,940 or ZWG5,340,930. 3 in the coordination and intervention of the disaster, said Kabikira.\n\n",
