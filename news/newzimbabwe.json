            "content": "The Conversation\n\nEdson Sitholewas born in what was then Southern Rhodesia in 1935. He was the first black person in southern Africa to obtain a Doctor of Laws degree. He was the second black person in the country (which became Zimbabwe in 1980) to qualify as a lawyer, and co-founded Rhodesias African Bar Association in 1973.\n\nSithole was an anti-colonial nationalist. He was disappeared alongside his secretary, Miriam Mhlanga, in downtown Salisbury (present-day Harare) 50 years ago. Brooks Marmon, a historian of Zimbabwes liberation struggle, has compiled and edited aforthcoming collectionof Sitholes writings, speeches and interviews.\n\nHe was one of the most prominent pan-African nationalists who had not gone into exile, a major legal and intellectual force behind multiple Zimbabwean liberation movements.\n\nDespite his important intellectual and organisational contributions to Zimbabwes independence struggle, he is best remembered today for the sensational nature of his elimination from the political scene. He left the Rhodesian press club at a downtown hotel in Salisbury on 15 October 1975, and was never seen again.\n\nThe 50th anniversary of Sitholes elimination is an apt time to recover his political voice. Sithole was a prolific writer but much of his work appeared in periodicals that were banned and silenced by settler authorities.\n\nThe contributions in the book highlight four themes: Sitholes views on pan-Africanism; his experience as a political prisoner; his views on intra-nationalist factionalism; and his search for a settlement with white Rhodesians.\n\nSitholes voice is supplemented by my own biographical account of his political life.\n\nGiven Zimbabwes struggles with political pluralism, the section on factionalism is especially illuminating. A recurring theme is Sitholes rivalry with one of the leading protagonists of Zimbabwes liberation struggle,Joshua Nkomo. Coupled with Sitholes overlooked membership in several breakaway liberation movements, a holistic view of his independent character emerges.\n\nThis was particularly notable in an era in which an absolute commitment to unity was a key facet of the defining ideology of the struggle,pan-Africanism.\n\nSithole was an executive member of four Zimbabwean liberation movements. In 1964 he became the publicity secretary of Zanu-PF, Zimbabwes current ruling party, then known as the Zimbabwe African National Union. He was that partys chief spokesperson 60 years ago this November when the colonys small white minorityunilaterally declared its independencefrom Britain.\n\nThe last decade of Sitholes life was spent trying to end this rebellion and usher in genuine independence under majority rule.\n\nWhen the Conservative British government appeared poised to reach a settlement favourable to continued white domination, Sithole co-founded the African National Council (ANC) in December 1971. Its opposition to the tentative accord forced the British government to abandon that effort to reconcile with their settler kith and kin in Rhodesia.\n\nWhite minority rule dragged on for eight more years and thousands lost their lives in the struggle to affect a change, including Sithole.\n\nSitholes intellectual profile was particularly impressive as he spent more than half of his adult life as a political prisoner. He was first detained in 1959 at the age of 23. He completed a masters degree in law from the University of London via correspondence during that first stint of restriction. During a second period of imprisonment, he completed most of his work toward a Doctor of Laws from the University of South Africa.\n\nIn April 1974, the hardline Estado Novo regime in Portugal was overthrown in amilitary coup. It soon became clear that Portugal would dismantle its colonial empire, including Mozambique and Angola.\n\nThis development transformed the political scene in southern Africa. White Rhodesia was deprived of a major European ally and a secure border on its eastern flank. At the end of that year, all four of Zimbabwes major liberation movements united under the banner of the African National Council in Zambia.\n\nFor some of the most prominent Zimbabwean nationalists, such as Nkomo and Robert Mugabe, the Portuguese revolution resulted in their release from prison, culminating in their ascent to political power in independent Zimbabwe in early 1980.\n\nSithole, however, experienced no fruits of dtente. Instead he became enmeshed in a political struggle with both the settler state and his erstwhile nationalist colleagues.\n\nIn early June 1975, intra African National Council violence erupted between factions loyal to its head, Abel Muzorewa, whom Sithole backed, and Nkomo, a long-time foe of Sithole, who had headed the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union.\n\nNearly a dozen people were killed and Sithole was manhandled by Nkomo loyalists.\n\nNear the end of the month, Sithole released a document which claimed that Nkomo and prime minister Ian Smith had reached a secret deal to elevate Nkomo to the head of the African National Council. Days later, Sithole developed severe stomach cramps. He declared that the settler statehad poisoned him, an allegation backed by a Zambian doctor who treated him.\n\nTensions increased. The last month of Sitholes life was consumed by attempts to derail any possible attempt by Nkomo and the Zapu element in the African National Council to reach an accord with the Rhodesian state.\n\nOn Sitholes last day as an independent man  15 October 1975  he held a press conference which accused the settler state of favouring Nkomo, whose faction had recently been allowed to hold a massive open-air meeting.\n\nTwo detectives visited Sithole at his office that afternoon and took a statement.\n\nThat evening, he made the short drive to the Ambassador Hotel in his blue BMW for drinks at the Quill Club.\n\nSithole left the hotel around 7pm, where a witness outside saw him met by two white and two black men who identified themselves as belonging to Rhodesias Special Branch. They escorted Sithole and his secretary into a grey Mazda van, a make typically associated with the renegade states security apparatus.\n\nInternational media accounts identified Detective Inspector Winston Hart and Detective Section Officer George Mitchell as the two white men. As recently as April 2023, an interview with Hart about his service in Rhodesiapopped up on YouTube.\n\nSithole was never seen again, although persistent rumours claimed that he had been seen in various government detention centres.\n\nSithole was just one of tens of thousands of individuals who died during Zimbabwes independence struggle.\n\nUnlike South Africa, Zimbabwe did not embrace any formal transitional justice mechanism following independence. After Mugabe was voted into power, he announced:\n\nWe will be interested to get some evidence as to what happened to Dr. Sithole. (16 March 1980 issue of the Zimbabwean Sunday Mail)\n\nNothing substantial ever came out of the inquiry.\n\nResearch Associate in the Department of Historical and Heritage Studies, University of Pretoria\n\n",

Zimplow also disposed of outdated equipment to free up capital for reinvestment. Proceeds from the sale of its Dagenham Road property have been channelled toward the establishment of a new mining and logistics hub in Msasa.\n\nThe groups strategic shift toward the mining sector is part of efforts to cushion itself from the volatility of the agriculture industry. However, a poor weather outlook,with forecasts predicting below-average rainfall,is expected to weigh heavily on its agriculture-focused subsidiaries, Farmec and Mealie Brand, which depend on rain-fed farming. This could dampen sales and create financial pressure, compounded by potential inventory build-ups from trade loans that may increase storage costs and force price cuts.\n\nDespite these headwinds, Zimplows mining-related operations remain robust. Subsidiaries such as Scanlink and Tractive Power Solutions continue to perform well, buoyed by sustained demand for heavy equipment in Zimbabwes mining sector. Similarly, Powermec is benefiting from increased demand for solar-powered generators amid persistent power shortages caused by drought conditions.\n\nThe company is also exploring drought-adaptive innovations, including modular irrigation kits and scalable solar power solutions, to diversify its revenue streams.\n\nHowever, smuggling continues to undermine operations at Trentyre and CT Bolts, with the influx of grey market imports eroding revenues.\n\nZimplows diversification strategy, supported by cost discipline and its pivot toward mining and renewable energy solutions, positions the group for potential recovery in the second half of 2025,provided it successfully navigates the prevailing economic and regulatory challenges.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has dealt a major blow to troubled mining giant RioZim Limited, ruling that the company cannot sell off its assets while under corporate rescue proceedings  a legal process meant to save firms from total collapse.\n\nJustice Regis Dembure has dismissed RioZims application to appeal an earlier order stopping it from disposing of mines and other key assets, saying the company had no legal leg to stand on.\n\nThe mere filing of the application with the Registrar of the High Court, even before the merits of the application are considered, has the effect of commencing corporate rescue proceedings, Dembure said, citing earlier rulings in the Metallon Gold case.\n\nIn simple terms, once a company files for corporate rescue, its hands are tied: it cannot sell assets, restructure freely, or dodge creditors without court oversight.\n\nRioZims lawyer, Advocate Thabani Mpofu, had argued the companys board should still be allowed to make operational decisions while waiting for a rescue practitioner to be appointed.\n\nThis board is alive; the provisions of section 127 should not prevent it from making necessary operational decisions to avoid financial distress, he argued.\n\nBut the Zimbabwe Diamond & Allied Minerals Workers Union, which brought the case, hit back.\n\nThe company cannot just choose which legal provisions apply to its convenience during its financial turmoil, said lawyer T.L. Mapuranga. The notion that the board can operate unrestricted is a gross misinterpretation of the law.\n\nJustice Dembure agreed with the union, ruling that RioZims bid was without merit and ordering the company to pay legal costs.\n\nThe decision comes as RioZim faces mounting pressure from workers it owes over US$37 million in unpaid wages and benefits. More than 200 employees recently won an arbitration award, but their victory has also been thrown into limbo.\n\nIn another recent judgment, Justice Catherine Bachi Mzawazi struck the case off the roll after RioZims lawyers argued the award could not be enforced because the company is under corporate rescue.\n\nThe law is indeed an ass, so they say, Justice Mzawazi remarked. The respondent tactfully sought refuge from the law at the detriment of the employees rights yet the law is the law nonetheless.\n\nShe said corporate rescue temporarily freezes all lawsuits until the process is completed  usually within three months.\n\nCorporate rescue is a lifeline thrown to enable a company in financial distress to be rehabilitated in order to make a financial turnaround so as to meet its obligations, she explained.\n\n",

            "content": "Beyond the Margins\n\nIt took four years, from conception to completion, to put together the anthology film,Map Your Love. Shot entirely on smartphones, by activists in countries such as Burkina Faso, Tunisia, Tanzania, Zimbabwe, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Jamaica, Peru and Canada, the four films that make up the anthology showcase deeply personal stories that explore the complexities of queer love, identity, and resilience in nations where homosexuality is criminalised.\n\nIn 2024, screenings of the anthology were held in various countries across Africa.\n\nKarin Haz is the founder and director of75 Shots, the Canada-based organisation which spearheaded the project. Haz says: Every screening in Africa was conducted underground, ranging from private gatherings in homes where traditional coffee ceremonies and food were shared, to full-scale festivals at undisclosed locations for safety reasons. Some were also held in community centres run by feminist activists. Each screening was unique, courageous, and extraordinary.\n\nFor Beyond the Margins,Carl Collisonspoke to three queer rights activists  Ghanas Prince Frimpong, TanzaniasMwamba T Nyanda and Zimbabwe-based Kudzai Kay-Dee  all of whomparticipated in the creation of this anthology and also put together a screening of the four-part film in their respective countries.\n\nIn this conversation, the activists discuss what drew them to film as an advocacy tool, how the medium is shaping their activism, and how, especially in repressive contexts, there is great power in telling ones story.\n\nKayuure (Nameless): The short documentary, Kayuure (Nameless), looks into the life of a transgender man from Burkina Faso, offering a glimpse into their journey of resilience, love, and self-discovery. Image: Supplied\n\nCarl Collison (CC):So, tell us about the screenings. How did it go? What stood out for you?Kudzai Kay-Dee (KK):So, I engaged an LBQ organisation. They were having a meetingSo, I took that opportunity to go there and screen our films. What stood out for me the most in terms of the people who were watching is that they realised that were using really simple gadgets to come up with something so beautiful; something so movingWe also had conversations around privilege and how we can be more supportive in our communities; how we can support each other, encourage each other to, you know, live our lives to the fullest.\n\nPrince Frimpong (PF):I collaborated with a youth-led organisation, called Let It Shine, in Lagos, and we did the screening together. They were doing a couple of activities for Pride in LagosSo, yeah, we did a screening, and (about 25) LGBTQI youth (attended). It was very amazing, you know, to witness this community coming together to watchMap Your Love. How it resonated with them was powerful to watch. And I think what really struck me was how people decode theMap Your Lovefilm in their own ways; in their own understandingIt felt so surreal. And it felt like, you know, people are really getting into the film that weve made. People are really, you know, resonating with it in their own waysand how they see themselves in the film that we made.\n\nAnd they were surprised that the film was even made (on) a mobile phone. You know, when the film started, I told them, Dont have any expectations. It is not the traditional way of making films. Just watch with an open-mindedness, and just like, you know, let yourself flow in what youre about to watch. They did, and they were stunned.\n\nIn Wildly Authentic, a young soul raised by two loving mothers, ponders the enigma of belonging. Image: Supplied\n\nMwamba T Nyanda (MN):The movie screening we did was done on 30thof June. We wanted to share these narrative stories of our lives on the African continent. And also to tell people that it is possible to narrate a story through the use of a phone, for example an iPhone or Samsung. And that, as an activist, a smartphone can be a tool for advocacy. Luckily, the turnout was good. A lot of members showed up (and) a lot were intrigued and also interested in learning how to create movies through mobile phones. Because most of the queer people in our society are very shy, but they are willing to tell the stories (from)( behind the camera. So, that was a good take-away for me.\n\nCC:None of you are filmmakers, right? All of you are queer activists in your respective countries. What made you decide to use film as a tool for your advocacy?\n\nKK:I think the first thing is accessibility So, (with traditional filmmaking,) by the time you get to the camera, and you know, all that editing, it kind of takes away from the rawness of the story. So, the phone is the one thing thats in your pocket that you can randomly take out and start creating something.\n\nPF:Mobile filmmaking is a powerful tool. And in my advocacy work, I feel like it is a way to establish the visibility of the LGBT community in Ghana and also across Africa. Ive always been someone who loves employing creative elements when it comes tojust putting our work online and utilising digital tools to drive positive change. So, to me, using mobile filmmaking or even arriving to doMap Your Loveits a way for me to, you know, tell stories that have been overlooked and tell it my own way. And utilise these mechanisms, or these tools, to tell these stories with no restrictions, with no boundaries and tell it unapologetically.\n\nMN:Ive always been interested in knowing about films and how to create (them), because I knew that at one point in my life this could be a good tool to sustain myself. I am also very interested in telling our stories. Because, as Africans, we have a lot of untold stories which we hide under the rugs due to the country contexts. I think narrating stories through film is a great way to reach people. So, I thought that being equipped myself with film skills can also help me to run my advocacy well.\n\nCC:How has this experience with film shaped your activism?\n\nInThe Sourcea trans man in Tanzania spends a day at the beach with his Rastafarian father, who shares life lessons with him and teaches him to swim. Image: Supplied\n\nMN:Filming has definitely shaped my activism because, number one, I have evolved from the strategies that I (employ) in the organisation. Because for many years we have been giving people capacity. We have been providing emergency support. We have been providing entrepreneurship skills. But we never have dealt with art or arti-vism; using art  music, dancing and filming  in advocating for our rights, visibility and freedom. So, this category of art, which is filming, has given me power. To me, its like a superpower because I get to narrate the stories, and create them however I want (in order) to pass on messages to the community at large.\n\nKK:I think, going forward, Ill definitely continue to use film and maybe not just film, but even pictures (created with) my mobile phone. Because its the one thing that is always in my pocket  other than my wallet. And I can always use that to tell different stories. Like you were saying, these are stories that are not told. These are stories that were telling in repressive countries. We dont stop telling the stories because of the nature of the environment. (So,) this is actually a very innovative and creative way to continue telling these stories in otherwise unsafe environment(s).\n\nCC:And for you, Prince?\n\nPF:You know, as part of my advocacy, Im always preaching about queer joy, queer liberation, queer freedom, and living our authentic self, unapologetically. You know, we are living in a homophobic country. And that is how its going to be. I feel like how does it all end when we are being killed and discriminated (against)? But when we take ownership of our own stories and tell them authentically, I feel like that is a way for us to mobilise more support networks, gain more resources, and invite people to the table to (discuss) critical issues that we face as a queer community. And these (things) can be done through filmmaking. So, it has really shaped my activism in so many ways. I mean, you know, its a new wave of activism. Its a new way of telling queer stories and giving us that kind of visibility or recognition that we need as a queer community. So, for me, it is something that Im always going to adopt in my advocacy: continue telling queer stories, continue telling Ghanaian queer stories and using these tools to Africanise and reshape our narrative. Also, as a side, teaching people the ways of using mobile (phones) to tell their own stories. And, you know, keep the movement going, and create positive change in this way.\n\n",

The first and second respondents (Labenmon Investments and the director Daniel Mlalazi) and are hereby found to be in contempt of this courts provisional order issued under Case Number HCCC15/25.\n\nShe further directed that the respondents are hereby ordered to immediately stop all works at the Wih-Zim Construction Material Investments Cement Manufacturing plant in Magunje, Hurungwe until the matter under HCCC15/25 is finalised.\n\nThe first respondent was fined US$3,000 payable within one month, while Mlalazi was sentenced to 30 days imprisonment, wholly suspended on condition that the company complies with the court order.\n\nMuzofas ruling comes after villagers from Kapere and Chasara under Ward 11 in Hurungwe, represented by Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) lawyers Tinashe Chinopfukutwa and Kelvin Kabaya, challenged the setting up of the cement plant, saying it was encroaching on their grazing and farming land.\n\nAccording to the villagers, the Chinese firm Labenmon Investments, which is linked to Wih-Zim, arrived in July 2024 and began fencing off the land without consultation.\n\nThe villagers later learnt that Labenmon Investments was going to establish a cement manufacturing plant on the pegged area, and they were prohibited from accessing their grazing fields and farming land, ZLHR said in a statement.\n\nThe lawyers argued that the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) erred in law by issuing an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) certificate to Labenmon Investments without receiving or properly evaluating the companys EIA report  a violation of sections 100(1) and 100(2) of the Environmental Management Act.\n\nThe Director-General of EMA violated the principles of natural justice as espoused in section 136 by failing to consult the appellants who are affected by the proposed cement manufacturing plant and giving them an opportunity to be heard, the lawyers said.\n\nThey further contended that the Director-General of EMA failed to exercise his powers by not inviting the developers and affected villagers to a consultative meeting as required by law.\n\nAbout 23 families are reportedly affected by the project, which has sparked outrage in the rural community for displacing farmers and cutting off access to communal grazing land.\n\n",
