            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has dismissed an application by the Zion Apostolic Sect which was suing Chirumanzu Rural District Council (RDC) for contempt of court following a US$900,000 property deal gone wrong.\n\nSitting at the Masvingo High Court, Justice Jester Charewa threw out the application, ruling that there is no evidence.\n\nThe judge said that while it is true that the pace of compliance with a court order by the RDC has been painfully slow, there has, nevertheless, been substantial compliance.\n\nAccordingly, as at the time of the hearing, the burden of the required full compliance, which forms the basis of this application rests heavily on the applicant itself: to first fulfil the transfer requirements.\n\nOn balance, therefore, I cannot, in the circumstances, find that the respondent can be held to be in contempt as there is no evidence of a failure to disobey a clear and unambiguous court order, but rather, evidence of tardy compliance coupled by applicant itself failing to fulfil transfer requirements.\n\nConsequently, wilfulness and mala fides being presumed from a failure to comply with a court order, I am of the view that the respondent has discharged the onus that it did comply with the court order, said the judge before she threw the application.\n\nThe background is that on 2 October 2017, the parties entered into a deed of settlement in HC1245/17, wherein the church had sued the respondent for payment of US$900,000.00.\n\nThe settlement was to the effect that in lieu of the monetary claim, and in full and final settlement of any claims between the parties, the respondent would allocate and, within a reasonable time, transfer (at applicants cost) two institutional stands to applicant.\n\nFurther,Chirumanzu RDCwould fence off its sewer ponds within the applicants farm withinsixmonths of the date of the deed of settlement.\n\nZion Apostolic Church said the RDCfailed to adhere to the terms of the deed of settlement.\n\nThe church was, accordingly and upon suing for specific performance on the deed of settlement, granted an order on 19 April 2023.\n\nThe order required the RDC to allocate and transfer two institutional standswithin 14 days of the grant of the order.\n\nIt was also supposed to fence off, with a fence appropriate to keep wild animals and the applicants livestock from consuming sewer pond water, sewer ponds located in the applicants farm within 30 days of the grant of the order.\n\nIt is this order that thechurch wanted the RDCto be held in contempt of.\n\nChirumanzu RDC argued that the order it was allegedto be in contempt of was not served upon it.\n\nThe RDC also said it was not in contemptas itwasactually complying with the court order, having allocated stand number 2861 as ordered, and stand number 4434 in lieu of Stand 2356, to the applicant; erected the fence around the sewer ponds as ordered and settled costs of suit.\n\nChirumanzu RDC also said it wasonly now awaitingthe churchsapplicants compliance with transfer requirements (which include meeting minimum construction requirements) in order to effect transfer, an argument which was accepted by the judge.\n\n",

The marriage now subsists only in name, court papers further show.\n\nMachaya, despite the service, elected to remain absent and therefore offered no apology or mitigation.\n\nThematter was set down on the unopposed roll afterherplea was struck out for non-attendance at the pre-trial conference and her subsequent application for rescission was deemed abandoned.\n\nLiabilitywas therefore not in issueand the courtwas onlyseized with the assessment of quantum under r 25(1) of the High Court Rules, 2021.\n\nWhile handing down his judgement, Justice Mambara said that when fixing adultery damages, the court considers the nature and duration of the marriage, knowledge of the marriage by the adulterer, character and social-economic standing of the parties and the extent of contumelia and loss of consortium proved.\n\nThe judge also looked into contrition (or lack thereof) by the adulterer, the need for deterrence, and the level of awards in comparable cases.\n\nMambara said there is no reported High Court decision afterthat ofTaoneyivs Madzima (HH 18-25)has exceeded the composite figure of US$20,000.\n\nInflation-adjusted though that award is, it remains the highest recent comparable award placed before the court, he said.\n\nThe judge said the plaintiff had along, otherwise stable marriage.\n\nHe said there was a total lack of contrition by Machaya, adding that such offenders deserve deterrent penalties.\n\nThe court is satisfied that an award modestly above the most recent ceiling of US $20,000 is justified to reflect both changing economic realities and the egregious facts of this case.\n\nAccordingly, it is ordered that the defendant shall pay to the plaintiff the sum of US $25,000 made up as follows:(a) Contumelia: US$16,000 (b) Loss of consortium: US$9,000.\n\nHe ruled that interest shall run on the above amount at the prescribed rate of 5 % per annum from the date of this judgment to the date of full and final payment.\n\nMachaya will also pay Dhudhlas costs of suit.\n\n",

He later said: Id like to know where that is because this [the videos] Ive never seen.\n\nThe lights were dimmed in the Oval Office as the videos were shown, including of South African officials allegedly calling for violence against white farmers.\n\nThe scene in the heart of the White House administration was reminiscent of Mr Trumps ambush of Ukraines Volodymyr Zelenskyy last February.\n\nSouth Africa has rejected the allegation that white people are disproportionately targeted by crime.\n\nThe clips include one of a communist politician playing a controversial anti-apartheid song that includes lyrics about killing a farmer.\n\nTrump accused South Africa of failing to address the killing of white farmers. People are fleeing South Africa for their own safety, the US president said. Their land is being confiscated and in many cases theyre being killed.\n\nAlluding to people in the videos, Trump said: These are people that are officials and theyre saying kill the white farmer and take their land.\n\nThe US president then displayed printed copies of news articles that he said showed white South Africans who had been killed, saying death, death as he flipped through them.\n\nHe added of one article: Heres burial sites all over the place, these are all white farmers that are being buried.\n\nSouth African leader rejects allegations\n\nRamaphosa pushed back against Trumps accusations, by responding: What you saw, the speeches that were being made, that is not government policy. We have a multi-party democracy in South Africa that allows people to express themselves, political parties to adhere to various policies.\n\nAnd in many cases or in some cases, those policies do not go along with government policy.\n\nOur government policy is completely, completely against what he [a person in the video montage] was saying. Even in the parliament. And they are a small minority party which is allowed to exist in terms of our constitution.\n\nRamaphosa also said of the behaviour alleged by Mr Trump: We are completely opposed to that.\n\nRamaphosa said there was crime in South Africa, and the majority of victims were black. Mr Trump cut him off and said: The farmers are not black. The South African president responded: These are concerns we are willing to talk to you about.\n\nExperts in South Africa have said there is no evidence of white people being targeted, although farmers of all races are victims of violent home invasions in a country that suffers from a very high crime rate.\n\n",
