Between January and July 2015, one of Mwanandimais bank accounts received nearly R679,000.\n\nLopdale Services and Investments was paid R14.65 million in the period between August 2015 to December 2019, while an additional R396,100 was also transferred.\n\nMwanandimai set up supplier accounts resembling existing ones, directing payments to accounts linked to himself and created a fake employee, who as part of ETUs Discovery Medical Aid Scheme, led to fraudulent contributions totalling R160,845 from September 2017 to April 2020.\n\nETU also paid R239,819 for his medical aid contributions to Bestmed from November 2016 to April 2020, without deducting these amounts from his salary.\n\nETU also covered his cellular phone accounts, with no recovery from his salary and he set up three debit orders on the entitys account.\n\nMwanandimai manipulated bank master data and payroll records to gain unauthorised benefits.\n\nHe initially had viewing rights on the banking system but was subsequently granted payment loading access after he requested further authorisation, according to court papers.\n\nMwanandimais actions were discovered after a new accountant was hired and audited the accounts, and established that he misappropriated over R17m, with about R6.8m, the capital debt, confirmed.\n\nIn September 2020, he acknowledged the use of funds from ETU and confirmed that the amount owed corresponds to the outstanding balance specified in the signed acknowledgment of debt.\n\nThe debtor (Mwanandimai) is truly and lawfully indebted and legally bound to the creditor (ETU) in the amount of six million seven hundred and ninety-seven thousand seven hundred and fifteen rand and sixty cents (R6 797 715.60), reads the acknowledgment of debt.\n\nIn the acknowledgment of debt, he admitted that he stole several millions of rand from ETU and that the total amount stolen was in excess of the capital debt. He did repay certain of the money which he stole.\n\nHis lawyers indicated that he was willing to settle the amount outstanding of R1.777m but could only afford an amount of R100,000 a month due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the July 2021 looting unrest, which has affected his business.\n\nIn a letter dated October 11, 2021, Mwanandimai offered to pay over R10.9m, starting January 31, 2022, over a period of 72 months, which is less than the outstanding balance of R17.1m.\n\nA certificate of balance indicating an amount of R17.1m was issued after all transactions were confirmed by the relevant banks, but Mwanandimai has not made any payments since June 2021.\n\nLast Thursday, Acting Judge Sanet van Aswegen found that Mwanandimai did not manage or disclose his estate with sufficient transparency, and that supporting documentation was provided only at the hearing, despite the prior submission of both an answering affidavit and a supplementary answering affidavit.\n\nIn my considered opinion, the interests of justice are best served by the court exercising its discretion to grant a final sequestration order.\n\nThe issuance of such an order would benefit all the creditors by invoking the pertinent provisions of the Insolvency Act, thereby facilitating an investigation of the estate for their advantage, the acting judge declared.\n\nETU also filed a fraud case with the Yeoville police station in September 2020.\n\nMwanandimais legal representative did not respond to requests for comment while attempts to contact ETU were unsuccessful.\n\n",

            "content": "The Guardian\n\nThe Rams linebacker spent the early part of his life in Zimbabwe. But he has kept his childhood memories alive as his football career has grown.\n\nFor Nate Landman, surprise has become routine. TheLos Angeles Ramslinebacker has lost count of the raised eyebrows, smirks, and awkward pauses when people learn where his story begins.\n\nThey dont believe me at first, Landman said. Ill show them Im covered in African tattoos, and some will say Im still lying until they look it up or someone will vouch for me.\n\nLandman isnt exaggerating  a white guy with a Californian accent isnt most peoples picture of what one of the NFLs few African players would look like. But born in Harare, Zimbabwes capital, in 1998, Landmans roots are intertwined with the countrys sporting tradition. His South African father, Shaun, was in Zimbabwe at the time playing international rugby. When an engineering consulting firm offered Shaun a position in California, the family seized the opportunity. When Nate was three, the Landmans had moved to Danville, California, bringing with them not just their belongings, but also a rich cultural identity.\n\nLandman is the only active NFL player with Zimbabwe roots. Stansly Maponga, also born in Zimbabwe, played from 2013 until 2015. The NFL doesnt have the influx of international players like the NBA. Foreign-born players comprise only 3% to 4% of the leagues numbers  Canada, Germany and Nigeria that have produced the most. The NFL is trying to change that, and created the International Player Pathway program as a way to increase the number of players born outside the United States.\n\nAs for Landman, as the years passed Harare became more of a childhood blur than a lived memory. But his family kept Zimbabwe alive in their home, particularly when it came to food.\n\nWe brought a lot of the Zimbabwean culture into our home, Landman said. Our home is still decorated as if we were still in Zimbabwe.\n\nAs his three siblings and parents took pride in their South African and Zimbabwean ties, Landman grew up between worlds: California suburbia on the outside, African traditions on the inside.\n\nAthleticism was never far from the conversation in the Landman household. Shaun had played at the University of Cape Town before representing Zimbabwe in rugby. Nates mother, too, was a competitive athlete.\n\nInspired by that legacy, Landman threw himself into sports. In high school, he excelled in rugby and baseball. But it was football that became his calling.\n\nAt the University of Colorado, Landmans relentless energy quickly made him a defensive cornerstone. Across five seasons, he developed a reputation as one of the better linebackers in the Pac-12 Conference. He earned first-team All-Pac-12 honors in 2019 and 2020 and added a second-team selection in 2021. His style of play  fast, physical, fearless  mirrored the competitive fire passed down from his father.\n\nBut the NFL is rarely a straight line.\n\nDespite his production at Colorado, Landmans name wasnt called during the 2022 NFL draft. Instead, he signed with the Atlanta Falcons as an undrafted free agent. He worked his way on to the roster, appearing in seven games as a special-teamer before being cut and placed on the practice squad later that season.\n\nIts tough being undrafted, Landman said. Its not an easy road. Its a road Im proud of because its made me the player I am today. I took advantage of the opportunities  Its a huge part of my story.\n\nPerseverance paid off the following season. Landman not only made the Falcons roster but started 14 of 16 games. He collected 110 tackles, seven tackles for loss, and owned the second-best run-stop rate in the NFL among qualified linebackers (12.6%).\n\nFor Landman, the achievement was about more than numbers. It was about validation.\n\nIt was about setting a goal, reaching it, and then setting another goal, he said. Becoming a starter in this league is something Im super proud of. Its something everyones striving to do. Its especially not easy for undrafted guys.\n\nIt was easy for Landman to sign a one-year contract this offseason with the Rams. The team was in need of his leadership at inside linebacker, and it helped that Landman had a strong relationship with Rams assistant defensive coach Jimmy Lake, with whom hed previously worked with in Atlanta under the same system.\n\nThese guys around me have allowed me to take a step up in my game, Landman said. Everyone [on defense] elevates each other, and thats the biggest thing that Ive noticed here.\n\nRams inside linebackers coach Greg Williams has noticed a few different intangibles that Landman has brought to the team.\n\nHe brings us something we havent had in a while, which is his communication and energy, said Williams, following the Rams preseason victory over the Cleveland Browns last Saturday. He understands the whole game from a run-game and a pass-game perspective. So, the fact that he communicates with the entire defense, hes the glue that brings it all together, which gives guys the freedom to play, and everybody loves it.\n\nWhether its the culture woven into his home life, the continent of Africa tattooed on the right side of his chest, or the determination that has carried him from an overlooked rookie to a starter in the NFL, Landman, who last visited his home country two years ago, continues to carry Zimbabwe with him onto the field.\n\nHard work may have built his career, but identity grounds it.\n\nHaving the support of my relatives who still live over there, he said, wearing tattoos, and having the Zimbabwe flag on the back of my helmet are all very important to me.\n\n",

            "content": "Jamaicans.com\n\nOn April 17, 1980, reggae icon Bob Marley stepped onto the stage at Rufaro Stadium in Harare to perform at Zimbabwes independence celebration. His songZimbabwerang through the air as a newly free nation celebrated the end of colonial rule. But the story behind the song goes deepershaped by Marleys connection to Africa, the liberation struggle, and a few musical friends in Ethiopia.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Marley frequently visited Ethiopia, drawn by his Rastafarian beliefs and support for African unity. During one visit toAddis Ababa, he was introduced to a group of African musicians working for the United Nations. One of them was a Zimbabwean jazz musician and poet who had formed a band calledThe United Nations Jazz Band. They werent reggae artists, but Marley took interest in their talent and their roots.\n\nThe band and Marley developed a musical friendship. Though coming from different genres, they began to experiment with blending Marleys reggae style with traditional African rhythms. One day, Marley shared that he had been working on a song about Zimbabwes independence. He believed freedom for the country was near and wanted to create something special to support that moment.\n\nThe musicians helped shape the song, bringing in African influencesespecially Shona soundsand Marley welcomed their input. The result wasZimbabwe, a track filled with powerful lyrics like,Every man got a right to decide his own destiny.It was included in Marleys 1979 albumSurvival, which carried strong messages of resistance and African liberation.\n\nWhen Zimbabwes independence was officially declared in April 1980, Marley was invited to perform at the celebration. The new government couldnt afford to pay him, but Marley didnt hesitate. He paid for everything himself, including flying in his band and sound equipment fromLondon.\n\nThat night at Rufaro Stadium, 40,000 people gathered, including world leaders like Prince Charles and Indira Gandhi. As Marley performedZimbabwe, thousands more tried to enter the stadium, and police used tear gas to control the crowd. Still, Marley stayed on stage and kept singing. His commitment to the people never wavered. To make up for those who couldnt see the first concert, he performed again the following nightthis time for over 100,000 people.\n\nMarleys presence meant more than entertainment. He stood with Zimbabwe at a turning point in its history. His performance wasnt just a showit was a statement of unity, freedom, and African pride. His song had become the unofficial anthem of Zimbabwes struggle and victory.\n\nEven after Marleys death in 1981,Zimbabweremains one of his most powerful and politically significant songs. It symbolizes not only a nations independence but also the power of music to inspire and unite people across borders.\n\nFor Zimbabweans, Marleys gift was unforgettablea reggae anthem that echoed their journey, struggles, and hope for the future.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nHIGH bank charges imposed by local institutions are severely choking financial inclusion and contradicting best practices from other regional players, the National Economic Consultative Forum (NECM) report has revealed.\n\nThe NECF report, which analyses Zimbabwes financial inclusion infrastructure, identifies some of the pressing issues affecting the countrys banking public. For instance, over and above the fixed monthly charges, an amount of US$3,00 is charged for every US$100 withdrawn.\n\nThe cost structure of banking services significantly affects financial inclusion, particularly for the informal sector. In Zimbabwe, bank charges are relatively high ($5.00 per month), which, combined with a 3% mobile money transaction fee and 4% transaction fees for the informal sector, can discourage the use of formal banking services, NECF said.\n\nThe Forum poked holes into the cost of borrowing, arguing it is also steep, with interest rates on loans averaging 12%, creating barriers for informal businesses seeking credit.\n\nNECF compared Zimbabwe to South Africa, which offers more affordable banking services, with lower bank charges around $3.00 per month, mobile money transaction fees (2%), and borrowing rates (7%).\n\nThese lower costs contribute to greater accessibility of financial services for both the formal and informal sectors, and combined with a robust financial ecosystem, encourage higher financial inclusion, said the forum.\n\nThe paper observes that, in Zimbabwe, the primary barriers to financial inclusion include high banking costs and a lack of banking infrastructure in rural areas, where 67% of the population resides.\n\nThe informal sector, which makes up 90% of the economy, remains largely underserved by formal financial institutions.\n\nWhile mobile network coverage (90%) is high, providing a solid foundation for mobile-based financial services, gaps in financial literacy (35%) and the high costs associated with mobile money transactions continue to restrict broader inclusion.\n\nOn Bank Branch Density, Zimbabwe had a score of 4.5 per 100,000 adults compared to South Africa, which has 9,8 per 100,000 adults.\n\nWhile mobile money penetration in Zimbabwe is high, internet penetration remains relatively low at 36%, limiting the potential for advanced digital financial services. To fully realise the benefits of digital financial inclusion, policymakers should focus on expanding internet connectivity, particularly in rural areas, the paper added.\n\n",
