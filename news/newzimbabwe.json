I survived because I could swim, he told the BBC.\n\nAnother resident, Saliu Sulaiman, said the floods had left him homeless and destroyed some of his cash business profits.\n\nI lost at least $1,500 to the floods. It was the proceeds from the sale of my farm produce the previous day. I contemplated going back into the room to get it, but the pressure of the water scared me.\n\nSome local residents have said that the flooding was so devastating because a nearby dam had burst, however the authorities have not confirmed this.\n\nOn Sunday, the National Emergency Management Agency (Nema) announced it had started the process of providing relief packages to people affected.\n\nThe agencyadded in a post on Facebookthat roads and bridges were also affected by the flood, which has had a knock-on effect on the local economy and traffic.\n\nThe Nigerian Red Cross alsoreleased a statement on Fridaysaying the floods had caused significant loss of life and widespread distress.\n\nFloods are not uncommon during the Nigerian rainy season, which lasts from April until October.\n\nIn 2024, Nigeria experienced flooding from heavy rain which caused deaths and drove people from their homes.\n\nThere was also severe flooding in 2022, when more than 600 people died and 1.3 million were displaced.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nPAN African financial services institution, Ecobanks partnership with Care International in Zimbabwe is set to see 450 schoolgirls receiving reusable menstrual hygiene kits as part of efforts to curb the tide of period poverty.\n\nMore than three million women and girls in the Southern Africa nation menstruate and the majority of them do not have proper and sufficient menstrual protection. According to a study by SNV Zimbabwe, 72% of menstruating schoolgirls do not use sanitary products simply because they cannot afford them.\n\nThe study also showed that 62% of schoolgirls in Zimbabwe miss school every month due to lack of sanitary pads and 70% of these girls are not even aware of any sanitary pads brand on the market.\n\nIn a gesture to commemorate the 2025 Menstrual Hygiene Day last Friday, Ecobank handed over a consignment of 450 menstrual hygiene kits for onward distribution to deserving school girls in Tsholothso District.\n\nThe kits include two packs of reusable sanitary pads totalling eight that will last for two to three years, two pairs of underwear, washing and bathing soap, toothbrush and toothpaste, a five litre bucket for soaking and a bath towel.\n\nSpeaking at the handover ceremony, Ecobanks Regional Head Consumer Banking, Patricia Mungwadzi-Musemesi committed to give a hand in alleviating period poverty.\n\nThis donation comes at a critical time. Across Zimbabwe, almost 60% of girls in rural schools miss school every month due to lack of access to menstrual hygiene products. That is not just a statisticit is a crisis. And it is one we must confront together.\n\nShe said the commitment to girls and women is not new to Ecobank as she chronicled the assistance extended to women and girls in Buhera and Lupane where projects inclined towards promoting financial inclusion for rural women, helping them access savings, credit, and training to build stronger futures have been rolled out.\n\nAt Ecobank, we are proud signatories of the UN Womens Empowerment Principles, and through our Ellevate programme, we have supported over 73,000 women-led businesses across Africa, providing over US$177 million in funding. We believe that when women and girls thrive, communities prosper.\n\nThis is what A Better Way means to usnot just better banking, but better lives. It means standing with girls in Tsholotsho, in Buhera, in Lupane, and across Zimbabwe. It means ensuring that no girl is left behind because of her period, Mungwadzi-Musemesi said.\n\nCare Zimbabwe Country Director, Walter Mwasaa said the humanitarian organisation places the welfare of women at the heart of its operations.\n\nAt Care Zimbabwe, we believe that no girl should ever have to choose between her education and her period. Yet, for millions of girls across our country, that is the painful reality. Period poverty is not just a health issueit is a barrier to opportunity, to equality, and to hope.\n\nThat is why we are proud to be taking this donation to Thsolotsho launching the Period Power Initiative in partnership with Ecobank, he said.\n\nThe Primary and Secondary Education Ministrys chief director for Learner Welfare ,Psychological Services and Special Needs Education, Hannah Maisiri hailed the donation saying the event was more than a celebrationit is a reaffirmation of our shared commitment to ensuring that no girl is left behind because of her period.\n\nWhen girls miss school every month due to lack of access to sanitary products, their education, confidence, and future are all put at risk. That is why the Government of Zimbabwe, through the Ministry of Education, has made it a priority to support menstrual hygiene management in schools, she said.\n\n",
