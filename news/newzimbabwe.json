            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nRaila Odinga, who was at the forefront of Kenyan politics for more than three decades and made five unsuccessful runs at the presidency, alleging that he was cheated of victory in every instance, has died. He was 80.\n\nOdinga passed away in India after suffering a heart attack, the Nairobi-based Star newspaper and other Kenyan media outlets reported.\n\nOdinga was the son of Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, who served as Kenyas first vice president in Jomo Kenyattas administration. Considered political royalty in the East African nation, he was wildly popular among his supporters who heeded his calls en masse to demonstrate when he complained about vote rigging.\n\nThe electoral disputes repeatedly triggered ethnic tensions and violence, most notably in 2008, when more than 1,100 people died and about 350,000 were forced to flee their homes. The United Nations and then-South African leader Thabo Mbeki mediated a truce that saw Odinga being appointed prime minister in a coalition government led by President Mwai Kibaki.\n\nOdinga narrowly lost his fifth bid for the presidency to William Ruto in 2022. While the nations highest court upheld the election outcome, Odinga said he had proof the results had been tampered with and called a series of protests against the outcome and rising living costs. Dozens of people died in the ensuing unrest.\n\nThe two men later agreed to work together and members of Odingas party were appointed to the cabinet and other government posts.\n\nRaila Amolo Odinga was born on Jan. 7, 1945, in the western Kenyan town of Maseno. Prior to going into politics, he studied engineering in Germany, lectured at the University of Nairobi and co-founded his own firm.\n\nHe was arrested in 1982 after being accused of participating in an attempted coup led by air force officers to oust President Daniel Arap Moi. He spent six years in prison without trial and was detained twice subsequent to his release. His final incarceration ended in 1991, the year Kenyas constitution was amended to allow multiparty politics.\n\nOdinga helped found the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy and was selected as a lawmaker for the Langata constituency in the capital, Nairobi, in the 1992 election.\n\nHe first stood for the presidency in 1997 as the National Development Partys candidate. Four years later, he merged his party with Mois Kenya African National Union, was elected as its secretary-general and appointed energy minister.\n\nOdinga parted ways with Kanu in 2002, after Moi backed Uhuru Kenyatta to succeed him as party leader, and teamed up with Kibaki, who had mounted a third presidential campaign. Their coalition, the National Rainbow Alliance, won the vote, ending almost four decades of uninterrupted Kanu rule.\n\nKibaki named Odinga as his minister of roads and public works, but the two fell out in 2004 when Odinga accused the president of reneging on a power-sharing deal.\n\nThe Orange Democratic Movement nominated Odinga as its presidential candidate in 2007. It won 99 parliamentary seats, while Kibakis Party of National Unity won just 43. Even so, the official results showed Kibaki won the presidential vote  an outcome that was tainted by allegations of rigging.\n\nThe widespread violence that ensued prevented Odinga from taking power and he had to settle for the post of prime minister, which he held for five years.\n\nOdinga lost the presidential vote to Uhuru Kenyatta in 2013 and again in 2017. The Supreme Court annulled the outcome of the latter contest, citing widespread irregularities. Odinga then boycotted the re-run, saying the conditions werent in place for a fair contest.\n\nThe two men later reconciled and Kenyatta backed Odingas 2022 presidential run, reneging on an undertaking to support Ruto, his then-deputy. Ruto prevailed in the first round, however, and the result stood despite the oppositions legal challenges and protests.\n\nIn February 2025, Odinga stood for election as head of the African Unions executive arm, but lost the contest to Mahamoud Ali Youssouf from Djibouti.\n\nOdinga married his wife Ida in 1973. They had four children.\n\n",

He also suspended key democratic institutions, like the electoral commission.\n\nGen Z protesters will be part of the changes because the movement was created in the streets so we have to respect their demands, he added.\n\nTroops and protesters have been celebrating the apparent ousting of President Rajoelina, with thousands waving flags in the capital, Antananarivo.\n\nCAPSAT, or the Personnel Administration and Technical and Administrative Services Corps, is the most powerful military unit in Madagascar.\n\nThe unit supported Rajoelina when he came into power in 2009, but joined the protesters on Saturday.\n\nMadagascars constitutional court has named Col Randrianirina as the countrys new leader, even though a statement from the presidents office said he was still in charge and denounced what it described as an attempted coup detat.\n\nRajoelinas whereabouts are unknown, but he has said he is sheltering in a safe place following an alleged attempt on his life by military personnel and politicians. CAPSAT has denied any involvement in any such move.\n\nThere have been unconfirmed reports that the president was flown out of the country on a French military aircraft.\n\nAlso on Tuesday the US state department urged all sides to pursue a peaceful solution in line with the constitutional order.\n\nCol Randrianirina told the BBC that Madagascar was a country where chaos reigns right now.\n\nChaos because theres no president  hes gone abroad.\n\nThe unrest began just over two weeks ago, after a youth-led movement beganprotesting against chronic water and power cuts across the country.\n\nThe demonstrations soon escalated, to reflect wider dissatisfaction with Rajoelinas government over high unemployment, rampant corruption and the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nProtestors clashed with security forces resulting in the death of at least 22 people and more than 100 others injured, according to the UN, although the Malagasy government has dismissed those figures and described them as based on rumours and misinformation.\n\nPresident Rajoelina, an entrepreneur and former DJ, was once seen as a fresh start for Madagascar.\n\nThe baby-faced leader became president when he was just 34, earning the title of Africas youngest leader, and going on to govern for four years, before returning to power after the 2018 election.\n\nBut he fell out of favour following allegations of cronyism and corruption, which he denied.\n\nDespite the fact that power appears to have shifted away from him, he has continued to try to influence events.\n\nRajoelina attempted to dissolve the national assembly before the opposition could vote to strip him of his presidency for abandonment of post, but that did not work.\n\nLawmakers voted to impeach Rajoelina by 130 votes to one blank ballot on Tuesday. Even members of his party, Irmar, voted overwhelmingly to impeach him.\n\nRajoelina rejected the vote, calling it null and void.\n\nThe African Union (AU) has warned against soldiers meddling in Madagascars political affairs and rejected any attempt at unconstitutional changes of government.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron called the situation greatly worrying.\n\nThe island has gone through a series of political upheavals in recent years.\n\nMadagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world, with 75% of its 30 million people living below the poverty line, according to the World Bank.\n\n",

            "content": "By Enos Denhere\n\nThe fight against cervical cancer in Zimbabwe is gaining new energy, not from doctors in white coats or policymakers in offices, but from teenagers and young adults armed with smartphones, friend networks and a desire to save lives.\n\nWe realised that when health workers visit schools, children listen but often forget. When peers explain, the message sticks. These ambassadors know the slang, they know the platforms and they know the fears.\n\n Sister Shelly Majira, Kuwadzana Polyclinic\n\nCervical cancer is the most common cancer among women in the country, accounting for almost a third of all female cancer diagnoses, and its the single deadliest cancer in Zimbabweans of any sex. Its also preventable with a dose of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine  and thats a fact these young health ambassadors are trying to spotlight in WhatsApp groups and through community campaigns. Their work is reshaping health conversations, tackling stigma and ensuring that prevention is a priority for future generations.\n\nTapiwanashe Nyezana, 25, a youth health ambassador at Kuwadzana Polyclinic in the capital, Harare, speaks passionately about the importance of vaccinating young girls before they reach adulthood. I want to see children grow up healthy and capable of fulfilling their dreams. Good health is the foundation of a successful life, which motivated me to take on this role. I believe that young girls deserve the opportunity to be protected from cervical cancer through vaccination before they reach adulthood, she said.\n\nTapiwanashe Nyezana outside Kuwadzana Polyclinic. Credit: Enos Denhere\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the HPV vaccine became available free-of-charge to girls aged 1014, in line with World Health Organization guidance, in 2018, but achieving optimal coverage has proved challenging.\n\nOur campaigns always emphasise the benefits of vaccines and aim to help our communities overcome fear and misconceptions. We urge young girls and their parents to act promptly and ensure children have access to vaccines, because cervical cancer is preventable through vaccination, Nyezana said.\n\nBarbra Mangwiro, a vendor near Kuwadzana Polyclinic, previously believed vaccines had negative side-effects  after hearing deceptive rumours that they served hidden agendas. However, after receiving vaccine education from young health ambassadors and nurses, her perspective shifted.\n\nI used to think vaccines were harmful, but after learning about their importance, I allowed my children to be vaccinated at school when the Ministry of Health rolled out its vaccination programmes, she said. I encourage mothers to make sure their children, particularly girls, are vaccinated at an early age against cervical cancer because vaccines are important.\n\nBarbra Mangwiro a parent and a vendor near Kuwadzana Polyclinic. Credit: Enos Denhere\n\nWHO established the ambitious 90-70-90 goals for 2030 as part of its Global Strategy to expedite the eradication of cervical cancer as a public health issue in November 2020. Those targets stipulate that by the time they are 15 years old, 90% of girls should have received all recommended HPV vaccinations; by the time they are 35, and again 45 years old, 70% of women should have had a high-performance cervical cancer test; and 90% of women who have been diagnosed with cervical cancer or precancer should receive the proper care and treatment. WHO created the Elimination Planning Tool (EPT) to assist countries in meeting these goals based on the unique health needs of their populations.\n\nIn Zimbabwe youth ambassadors play a crucial role in translating this elimination strategy to the local level, according to the Permanent Secretary at the Ministry of Health and Child Care, Dr Aspect Maunganidze. Youth campaigners spread accurate information, address myths, and encourage early protection for girls aged 1014 years.\n\nLocal clinics are critical in our primary health care service delivery, and training youth advocates is fully aligned with our national HPV vaccination strategy, which aims to raise awareness, improve acceptance, and increase coverage.\n\nTheir efforts are essential as we work toward the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem, Dr Maunganidze said.\n\nDr. Aspect Maunganidze, Permanent Secretary, Ministry of Health and Child Care. Credit: Enos Denhere\n\nThat project received a boost recently, when the Ministry recently approved a single-dose HPV vaccination schedule, following WHO recommendations. Dr Maunganidze explained, The single-dose schedule is equally effective as the two-dose schedule, easier to deliver, and improves coverage by reducing missed doses.\n\nIn Kuwadzana, a high-density suburb of Harare, health workers are tapping into the power of peer influence to boost HPV vaccination among young girls. According to Sister Shelly Majira of Kuwadzana Polyclinic, the suburb has a population of 103,198, which includes 34,778 children under the age of 15. Among them, 10,630 are girls aged 10 to 14  the target group for the HPV vaccine in Zimbabwe.\n\nSister Shelly Majira explains HPV at Kuwadzana Polyclinic. Credit: Enos Denhere\n\nTo reach this group more effectively, the clinic partners with NGOs likeZvandiri, which runs a peer-counselling initiative aimed at kids and young people living with HIV, through a programme of youth health ambassadors. These young peer educators are trained in basic health communication, myth-busting and digital advocacy. Sister Majira, who supervises the ambassadors, emphasises the value of empowering youth to lead.\n\nWe realised that when health workers visit schools, children listen but often forget. When peers explain, the message sticks. These ambassadors know the slang, they know the platforms and they know the fears, she explained.\n\nSister Majira notes that one of the major barriers to vaccination is parental misconceptions. Many parents mistakenly believe that the HPV vaccine is intended for family planning. This perception contributes to low walk-in numbers at clinics.\n\nFrom January to May, only seven to 17 girls per month came for HPV vaccination at the clinic. However, when we engaged in school outreach programs, we saw a remarkable increase118 vaccinated in June and 357 in July. This shows that vigorous outreach, supported by our youth ambassadors, is key to reaching more children, she said.\n\nMonica Mutuma, one of the youth health ambassadors, explained that their work focuses on engaging young girls, and educating them about the importance of early vaccination to protect against cervical cancer. We share information on staying protected, fight against misinformation, and encourage vaccination while its still early.\n\nI can confidently say that around 70% of people we interact with are welcoming us, which shows we are making headway against misinformation.\n\n Monica Mutuma, youth health ambassador\n\nHowever, the final decision usually rests with the parents. Some of them used to believe the vaccine is for family planning or that it could cause infertility, she said.\n\nDespite encountering challenges  including a shortage of resources for creating flyers and accessing tools for data collection  Mutuma is optimistic about the impact of peer-led education. We are grateful to Sister Majira and her team for equipping us with the knowledge and skills to respond to questions during our outreaches and at the clinic. I can confidently say that around 70% of people we interact with are welcoming us, which shows we are making headway against misinformation, she added.\n\nPushing back against misinformation means making strides towards a safer future. In July, ten-year-old Keila Mazarura came home and told her mother, Ido Togaresei, about an HPV vaccination session that would be taking place at the school. In times past, Togaresei said, misconceptions would have caused her to forbid her child from receiving the jab. But lately its grown easier to access the facts. I permitted her to get the dose, Togaresei toldVaccinesWork.She was so happy about it, because it is her health that matters.\n\nThis article was originally published onVaccines Work.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nA joint parliamentary report has laid bare conditions in Zimbabwes prisons, exposing chronic overcrowding, dilapidated facilities, inadequate basics, and inhuman treatment of inmates as the most critical challenges facing the Zimbabwe Prisons and Correctional Service (ZPCS).\n\nThe Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs Committee and the Thematic Committee on Human Rights found that most correctional facilities are operating at between 200% and 300% above capacity, with some holding more than triple their intended numbers.\n\nGwanda Prison was holding 210 inmates against a capacity of only 60, representing a staggering 350% overcrowding whilst Chikurubi Maximum Security Prison had 2,689 inmates crammed into facilities designed for 1,114 and Binga Prison had 78 inmates with the holding capacity of 45.\n\nSimilarly, Harare Remand Prison was overcrowded by over 50%, with 1,361 inmates held in a facility meant for 900. Bindura Prison reported 443 inmates versus its capacity of 393, and Marondera stood at 730 inmates for a space meant to accommodate only 358, read part of the report.\n\nThe report revealed that most prison infrastructure remains in a dire state, with many facilities constructed during the colonial era as far back as 1910 and never adequately maintained or expanded to accommodate the growing inmate population. This has led to cramped, unsanitary, and poorly ventilated conditions.\n\nOvercrowding has led to serious human rights and health implications, including inmates sleeping in cramped, poorly ventilated, and leaking cells, strained sanitation systems, insufficient bedding and increased risk of disease transmission, and limited access to healthcare.\n\nWhile commending government for improvements in food and nutrition,noting that inmates are now served three meals a day,the committee highlighted severe shortages of clothing and bedding, which compromise dignity and health, particularly during the winterseason.\n\nAt some prisons, the Committee found inmates wearing torn or worn-out clothes, with some relying on donations from relatives. Additionally, blankets were in critically short supply. Inmates were permitted to bring their own blankets due to a mismatch between inmate numbers and available bedding.\n\nThe report also described the state of prison healthcare as severely under-resourced, undermining the constitutional right of inmates to basic medical care.\n\nAll prisons, including Harare Remand, Hurungwe, Khami, Marondera, Chikurubi, Chipinge, and Gwanda, reported frequent shortages of medication, especially for chronic conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, and mental health disorders. In several instances, inmates were entirely dependent on relatives for the supply of essential medicines, with facilities like Khami and Chikurubi reporting dangerously low supplies.\n\nPsychiatric inmates were said to be particularly affected by the unavailability of medication, worsening their vulnerability.\n\nDespite the challenges, the committee noted that rehabilitation and reintegration efforts are gaining momentum within the ZPCS, with many prisons introducing vocational and academic training programmes,signalling a shift from a punitive to a correctional model.\n\nHowever, lack of digital infrastructure continues to hamper access to justice, with many inmates unable to follow up on appeals or trials due to lack of printing facilities and systemic failure of individuals held on remand for extended periods without trial.\n\nDuring a visit to Harare Remand Prison, the committee also witnessed instances of inhuman treatment of inmates.\n\nInmates were seen sitting on a wet floor, which had recently been cleaned, while Class D inmates, committee members were informed that some inmates had recently been beaten following the escape of two inmates from the prison.\n\n",

The document purportedly establishes how these cartels siphon cash from state coffers through fraud and corruption.\n\nIn a statement released Tuesday, Timba called for thorough forensic investigations into government contracts.\n\nAccordingly, I call for: An independent forensic audit of all public contracts linked to the named individuals. Full public accountability for the looting and abuse of state resources, Timba stated.\n\nTimbas call for forensic investigations follows Bikita South MP and then Chairperson of the Budget and Finance Parliamentary Portfolio Committee, Energy Mutodisallegations that Finance Ministry Permanent Secretary George Guvamatanga is demanding bribes worth millions of United States dollars from various government contractors, threatening to withhold payments if his demands are not met.\n\nMutodi further demanded that Parliament summon George Guvamatanga to clear his name, but later retracted his statements.\n\nTimba called for the immediate abandonment of the Agenda 2030, where President Emmerson Mnangagwas loyalists are pushing for him to remain in power until 2030.\n\nMnangagwa has repeatedly declined this offer and insisted he will leave office at the end of his term in 2028.\n\nTimba warned that this notion must be quashed without delay.\n\nAt the same time, the so-called 2030 Agenda to extend the Presidents term must be abandoned in its entirety. Any attempt to alter presidential term limits without a referendum is unconstitutional and illegitimate, he said.\n\nTimba argued that a government mired in corruption forfeits any right to request an extension of its term.\n\nA government under such clouds of corruption cannot seek more years in power. It must instead submit itself to the Constitution and the people.\n\nHe continued, This fight is not merely about term limits; it is about defending our Republic from state capture disguised as stability  and about reaffirming that in Zimbabwe, no one is above the law. Let those who hold power remember: the Constitution was written to protect the people, not to shield the powerful.\n\nAccording to government figures, Zimbabwe is losing US$2 billion annually due to corruption and illicit financial dealings.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Supreme Court has upheld the dismissal of Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) officer Stanford Sithole, who was fired for distributing pornographic material through his official work email, ending a legal battle that has dragged on for nearly a decade.\n\nIn a ruling delivered on October 7, 2025, Justice Alphius Chitakunye said the decision underscored the critical importance of maintaining professional standards in the workplace, reaffirming the courts stance on integrity within public institutions.\n\nSithole, stationed in Gweru, was dismissed in 2016 after an internal ZIMRA probe revealed he had sent 13 explicit emails from his work account, a clear breach of the authoritys IT policy, which bans misuse of company assets.\n\nA designated agent initially cleared him, citing insufficient evidence, a decision later upheld by the Labour Court, which noted the possibility of hacking.\n\nBut the Supreme Court overturned that finding, ruling that the burden was on Sithole to prove his account had been compromised.\n\nWhile hacking is difficult, it is not impossible. However, the evidence presented sufficiently pointed to the respondents responsibility for the emails in question, the court said.\n\nZIMRAs IT manager, Mazhindu, testified that investigators used secure forensic tools to trace the emails, explaining the system was difficult to alter or compromise.\n\nSithole had argued he was a victim of a management conspiracy over his involvement in a workers committee. But the judges dismissed that claim, stating, Allegations of bias must be backed by convincing evidence, not mere assertions.\n\nHe also suggested the emails could have been sent by others sharing his workstation. The court rejected that, noting ZIMRAs system required individual credentials for access, which Sithole admitted he had not shared.\n\n",
