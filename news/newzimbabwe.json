            "content": "The Conversation\n\nEdson Sitholewas born in what was then Southern Rhodesia in 1935. He was the first black person in southern Africa to obtain a Doctor of Laws degree. He was the second black person in the country (which became Zimbabwe in 1980) to qualify as a lawyer, and co-founded Rhodesias African Bar Association in 1973.\n\nSithole was an anti-colonial nationalist. He was disappeared alongside his secretary, Miriam Mhlanga, in downtown Salisbury (present-day Harare) 50 years ago. Brooks Marmon, a historian of Zimbabwes liberation struggle, has compiled and edited aforthcoming collectionof Sitholes writings, speeches and interviews.\n\nHe was one of the most prominent pan-African nationalists who had not gone into exile, a major legal and intellectual force behind multiple Zimbabwean liberation movements.\n\nDespite his important intellectual and organisational contributions to Zimbabwes independence struggle, he is best remembered today for the sensational nature of his elimination from the political scene. He left the Rhodesian press club at a downtown hotel in Salisbury on 15 October 1975, and was never seen again.\n\nThe 50th anniversary of Sitholes elimination is an apt time to recover his political voice. Sithole was a prolific writer but much of his work appeared in periodicals that were banned and silenced by settler authorities.\n\nThe contributions in the book highlight four themes: Sitholes views on pan-Africanism; his experience as a political prisoner; his views on intra-nationalist factionalism; and his search for a settlement with white Rhodesians.\n\nSitholes voice is supplemented by my own biographical account of his political life.\n\nGiven Zimbabwes struggles with political pluralism, the section on factionalism is especially illuminating. A recurring theme is Sitholes rivalry with one of the leading protagonists of Zimbabwes liberation struggle,Joshua Nkomo. Coupled with Sitholes overlooked membership in several breakaway liberation movements, a holistic view of his independent character emerges.\n\nThis was particularly notable in an era in which an absolute commitment to unity was a key facet of the defining ideology of the struggle,pan-Africanism.\n\nSithole was an executive member of four Zimbabwean liberation movements. In 1964 he became the publicity secretary of Zanu-PF, Zimbabwes current ruling party, then known as the Zimbabwe African National Union. He was that partys chief spokesperson 60 years ago this November when the colonys small white minorityunilaterally declared its independencefrom Britain.\n\nThe last decade of Sitholes life was spent trying to end this rebellion and usher in genuine independence under majority rule.\n\nWhen the Conservative British government appeared poised to reach a settlement favourable to continued white domination, Sithole co-founded the African National Council (ANC) in December 1971. Its opposition to the tentative accord forced the British government to abandon that effort to reconcile with their settler kith and kin in Rhodesia.\n\nWhite minority rule dragged on for eight more years and thousands lost their lives in the struggle to affect a change, including Sithole.\n\nSitholes intellectual profile was particularly impressive as he spent more than half of his adult life as a political prisoner. He was first detained in 1959 at the age of 23. He completed a masters degree in law from the University of London via correspondence during that first stint of restriction. During a second period of imprisonment, he completed most of his work toward a Doctor of Laws from the University of South Africa.\n\nIn April 1974, the hardline Estado Novo regime in Portugal was overthrown in amilitary coup. It soon became clear that Portugal would dismantle its colonial empire, including Mozambique and Angola.\n\nThis development transformed the political scene in southern Africa. White Rhodesia was deprived of a major European ally and a secure border on its eastern flank. At the end of that year, all four of Zimbabwes major liberation movements united under the banner of the African National Council in Zambia.\n\nFor some of the most prominent Zimbabwean nationalists, such as Nkomo and Robert Mugabe, the Portuguese revolution resulted in their release from prison, culminating in their ascent to political power in independent Zimbabwe in early 1980.\n\nSithole, however, experienced no fruits of dtente. Instead he became enmeshed in a political struggle with both the settler state and his erstwhile nationalist colleagues.\n\nIn early June 1975, intra African National Council violence erupted between factions loyal to its head, Abel Muzorewa, whom Sithole backed, and Nkomo, a long-time foe of Sithole, who had headed the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union.\n\nNearly a dozen people were killed and Sithole was manhandled by Nkomo loyalists.\n\nNear the end of the month, Sithole released a document which claimed that Nkomo and prime minister Ian Smith had reached a secret deal to elevate Nkomo to the head of the African National Council. Days later, Sithole developed severe stomach cramps. He declared that the settler statehad poisoned him, an allegation backed by a Zambian doctor who treated him.\n\nTensions increased. The last month of Sitholes life was consumed by attempts to derail any possible attempt by Nkomo and the Zapu element in the African National Council to reach an accord with the Rhodesian state.\n\nOn Sitholes last day as an independent man  15 October 1975  he held a press conference which accused the settler state of favouring Nkomo, whose faction had recently been allowed to hold a massive open-air meeting.\n\nTwo detectives visited Sithole at his office that afternoon and took a statement.\n\nThat evening, he made the short drive to the Ambassador Hotel in his blue BMW for drinks at the Quill Club.\n\nSithole left the hotel around 7pm, where a witness outside saw him met by two white and two black men who identified themselves as belonging to Rhodesias Special Branch. They escorted Sithole and his secretary into a grey Mazda van, a make typically associated with the renegade states security apparatus.\n\nInternational media accounts identified Detective Inspector Winston Hart and Detective Section Officer George Mitchell as the two white men. As recently as April 2023, an interview with Hart about his service in Rhodesiapopped up on YouTube.\n\nSithole was never seen again, although persistent rumours claimed that he had been seen in various government detention centres.\n\nSithole was just one of tens of thousands of individuals who died during Zimbabwes independence struggle.\n\nUnlike South Africa, Zimbabwe did not embrace any formal transitional justice mechanism following independence. After Mugabe was voted into power, he announced:\n\nWe will be interested to get some evidence as to what happened to Dr. Sithole. (16 March 1980 issue of the Zimbabwean Sunday Mail)\n\nNothing substantial ever came out of the inquiry.\n\nResearch Associate in the Department of Historical and Heritage Studies, University of Pretoria\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nNotorious theft suspect Romeo Kurai Pemba (39), once convicted of theft in 2015,has once again found himself in court, this time accused of breaking into multiple government offices, including those under the Office of the President and Cabinet, and stealing property worth over US$23,000.\n\nPemba was arrested on October 2, 2025, after an extensive investigation by the CID Stores and Business Unitin Harare. According to police, he was captured on CCTVcommitting the crimes and later led detectives to the recovery of part of the stolen propertyvalued at US$1,400.\n\nHe appeared before Harare magistrate Tapiwa Kuhudzai, who remanded him in custody after he pleaded to all nine counts of unlawful entry. His plea recording is expected to continue on Tuesday before sentencing.\n\nThe State alleges that between June and September 2025, Pemba went on a burglary spree targeting high-security government officeslocated in Mukwati and Kaguvi Buildings, including those belonging to the Office of the President and Cabinet, the Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of Womens Affairs, Gender and Wellness, and ZimStat.\n\nPemba allegedly used unknown tools to force open office doors and stole laptops, CPUs, monitors, and other electronic equipment. Several items have since been positively identifiedby the affected departments.\n\nThe accused person was captured on CCTV committing the crime and the footage is held as an exhibit, reads part of the police remand request. He led to the recovery of part of the stolen property and indicated how he committed the crime. Fingerprints uplifted at the scene matched those of the accused.\n\nPolice strongly opposed bail, citing Pembas previous conviction and high flight risk. Detective Assistant Inspector Christopher Lloyd Tarenyikastated that Pemba has no fixed addressand could easily abscond or interfere with witnesses.\n\nThe accused person has known previous convictions under CRB HREP 10833/15, Tarenyika said. He is facing a serious offence which, if convicted, attracts a lengthy custodial sentence. There is overwhelming evidence linking him to the crime, and if granted bail, he may abscond or interfere with witnesses.\n\nThe charges fall under Section 131(1)(a)as read with Section 131(2)(e)of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act [Chapter 9:23], which covers aggravated unlawful entry.\n\nPembas latest arrest adds to his record of theft-related offences. Police say he was convicted in 2016following similar allegations. Investigations into related cases are ongoing, with at least 15 witnessesexpected to testify. The total value of stolen property is pegged at US$23,020, with only a fraction recovered so far.\n\nHe remains in custody pending his next court appearance.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has dealt a major blow to troubled mining giant RioZim Limited, ruling that the company cannot sell off its assets while under corporate rescue proceedings  a legal process meant to save firms from total collapse.\n\nJustice Regis Dembure has dismissed RioZims application to appeal an earlier order stopping it from disposing of mines and other key assets, saying the company had no legal leg to stand on.\n\nThe mere filing of the application with the Registrar of the High Court, even before the merits of the application are considered, has the effect of commencing corporate rescue proceedings, Dembure said, citing earlier rulings in the Metallon Gold case.\n\nIn simple terms, once a company files for corporate rescue, its hands are tied: it cannot sell assets, restructure freely, or dodge creditors without court oversight.\n\nRioZims lawyer, Advocate Thabani Mpofu, had argued the companys board should still be allowed to make operational decisions while waiting for a rescue practitioner to be appointed.\n\nThis board is alive; the provisions of section 127 should not prevent it from making necessary operational decisions to avoid financial distress, he argued.\n\nBut the Zimbabwe Diamond & Allied Minerals Workers Union, which brought the case, hit back.\n\nThe company cannot just choose which legal provisions apply to its convenience during its financial turmoil, said lawyer T.L. Mapuranga. The notion that the board can operate unrestricted is a gross misinterpretation of the law.\n\nJustice Dembure agreed with the union, ruling that RioZims bid was without merit and ordering the company to pay legal costs.\n\nThe decision comes as RioZim faces mounting pressure from workers it owes over US$37 million in unpaid wages and benefits. More than 200 employees recently won an arbitration award, but their victory has also been thrown into limbo.\n\nIn another recent judgment, Justice Catherine Bachi Mzawazi struck the case off the roll after RioZims lawyers argued the award could not be enforced because the company is under corporate rescue.\n\nThe law is indeed an ass, so they say, Justice Mzawazi remarked. The respondent tactfully sought refuge from the law at the detriment of the employees rights yet the law is the law nonetheless.\n\nShe said corporate rescue temporarily freezes all lawsuits until the process is completed  usually within three months.\n\nCorporate rescue is a lifeline thrown to enable a company in financial distress to be rehabilitated in order to make a financial turnaround so as to meet its obligations, she explained.\n\n",

Most of the purveyors of this succession issue are known not to be members of Zanu PF; they are known not to be within the structures of Zanu PF.\n\nAs Zanu PF, we will not allow a conversation to be imported into the party. We are going to a conference to check on the mandate which we received from the people in 2023.\n\nAlthough party slogans declaring that Mnangagwa will be in power up until 2030 appear to have been silenced, at provincial, district or cell meetings, they continue being chanted, even in the presence of party bigwigs such as Kazembe Kazembe and Owen Ncube in the Midlands Province.\n\nRecent Politburo meetings have been nothing short of explosive, with Chiwenga standing up to Mnangagwa and bringing dossiers to nail his allies and fear abounds that their tussle could result in another coup.\n\nChiwenga, then Commander of Zimbabwes military, led the 2017 coup that installed Mnangagwa as state leader. Although his influence in the army might have been diluted by his decision to join politics, there is fear that he has a lot of sympathisers within its ranks.\n\nMnangagwa has most of Zimbabwes cash-rich individuals, all of whom would be ready to defend his stay to protect their interests.\n\nAdded Marapira: The relationship between the President and his two Vice Presidents is friendly.\n\nAll this talk of animosity, hatred and fighting is a narrow agenda by other parties hoping to bring alarm and despondency within our rank and file.\n\n",

The first and second respondents (Labenmon Investments and the director Daniel Mlalazi) and are hereby found to be in contempt of this courts provisional order issued under Case Number HCCC15/25.\n\nShe further directed that the respondents are hereby ordered to immediately stop all works at the Wih-Zim Construction Material Investments Cement Manufacturing plant in Magunje, Hurungwe until the matter under HCCC15/25 is finalised.\n\nThe first respondent was fined US$3,000 payable within one month, while Mlalazi was sentenced to 30 days imprisonment, wholly suspended on condition that the company complies with the court order.\n\nMuzofas ruling comes after villagers from Kapere and Chasara under Ward 11 in Hurungwe, represented by Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR) lawyers Tinashe Chinopfukutwa and Kelvin Kabaya, challenged the setting up of the cement plant, saying it was encroaching on their grazing and farming land.\n\nAccording to the villagers, the Chinese firm Labenmon Investments, which is linked to Wih-Zim, arrived in July 2024 and began fencing off the land without consultation.\n\nThe villagers later learnt that Labenmon Investments was going to establish a cement manufacturing plant on the pegged area, and they were prohibited from accessing their grazing fields and farming land, ZLHR said in a statement.\n\nThe lawyers argued that the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) erred in law by issuing an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) certificate to Labenmon Investments without receiving or properly evaluating the companys EIA report  a violation of sections 100(1) and 100(2) of the Environmental Management Act.\n\nThe Director-General of EMA violated the principles of natural justice as espoused in section 136 by failing to consult the appellants who are affected by the proposed cement manufacturing plant and giving them an opportunity to be heard, the lawyers said.\n\nThey further contended that the Director-General of EMA failed to exercise his powers by not inviting the developers and affected villagers to a consultative meeting as required by law.\n\nAbout 23 families are reportedly affected by the project, which has sparked outrage in the rural community for displacing farmers and cutting off access to communal grazing land.\n\n",
