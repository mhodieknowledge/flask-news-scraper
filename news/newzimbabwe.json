The resolution, adopted at the partys annual conference in Mutare, directed the ruling partys Legal Affairs Secretary to begin drafting the necessary constitutional amendments.\n\nMnangagwa is currently serving his second and final term, as is mandated by the constitution. While he has previously described himself as a constitutionalist, adding he will step down in 2028, he has done nothing to oppose his loyalists, who are pushing for him to hang onto power.\n\nIn a statement of solidarity with the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), ITUC-Africa Secretary General Joel Odigie said African workers have consistently upheld democracy and constitutionalism as the foundation of peace, justice, and shared prosperity.\n\nITUC-Africa Secretary General JoelOdigie\n\nWe join ZCTU in urging African citizens, civil society, and the labour movement to remain vigilant and steadfast in defending the integrity of their constitutions, said Odigie.\n\nSocieties that work are those governed by the rule of law, not the law of force. When constitutions are trampled, democracy dies and with it, the hopes of workers for decent work, social justice, and equitable development.\n\nOdigie called on African Union member states, regional economic communities, and global partners to reaffirm their commitment to constitutional rule and accountable democratic governance as essential pillars of Africas transformation agenda.\n\nThe continental labour leader also rejected military involvement in civil governance and condemned civilian coups, where leaders manipulate constitutions to unlawfully extend their stay in power.\n\nHe further criticised attempts to silence opposition voices, manipulate electoral systems, or stage sham elections designed to entrench authoritarian rule, saying such actions erode hard-won democratic gains.\n\nWe commend leaders across Africa who have resisted the temptation to alter term limits or manipulate constitutions for personal gain. These are true statespersons, guardians of constitutional democracy worthy of respect by future generations, Odigie said.\n\nHe added that leaders who dismantle constitutional order and weaken democratic institutions for the sake of political survival corrode governance, polarise societies, and expose their nations to instability, insecurity, and economic decline.\n\n",

She also found them to be flight risks given the gravity of the allegations.\n\nThe ten, Rose Chirenje (65), Nyarai Chigudu (52), Kenesia Jera (62), Edward Mandikutse (69), Dexter Jena (69), Hazvinei Machingura (69), Stephen Chagwiza (48), Jacob Masaraure (75), Mapengo Mapengo (57) and Joephrey Chigwerewe (70) were charged with participating in a gathering with intent to promote public violence, breaches of peace or bigotry under Section 37(1)(a)(i) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act [Chapter 9:23].\n\nProsecutors allege that on October 17, the accused, acting on Gezas social media calls, gathered near Africa Unity Square in Harare, intending to join the protest against Mnangagwas government.\n\nAccording to police, the group was intercepted at the corner of George Silundika Avenue and Sam Nujoma Street while singing and dancing to a protest song with the lyrics, Zvigananda chera mwena nguva yakwana, chera mwena zvigananda, meaning Economic saboteurs, your time is up.\n\nDetectives from CID Law and Order said six suspects were arrested at the scene, while four others Chagwiza, Masaraure, Mapengo and Chigwerewe were later found hiding in a silver Toyota Probox parked at Corner Sixth Street and Kwame Nkrumah Avenue.\n\nInvestigators claim they recovered stones, boulders, and other missiles hidden near the protest site.\n\nIn opposing bail, Detective Sergeant Lovemore Chisi said releasing the accused could endanger public order.\n\nThe nature of the offence suggests a propensity for inciting or engaging in further public disorder, he said. Releasing the accused could reignite unrest or embolden others.\n\nChisi also warned that the accused might abscond from trial, given the lengthy custodial sentence they face if convicted, an argument upheld by the magistrate.\n\nPolice said investigations were ongoing and that several other suspects linked to the planned march remain at large.\n\n",

Despite this, the parallel market premium remained relatively constant at around 27%, indicating some degree of exchange rate convergence.\n\nCZI added that the still-high annual inflation rate largely reflects the September 2024 devaluation of the ZiG, and that inflation pressures are expected to ease further in October 2025, provided no new shocks emerge.\n\nAfter rising in July 2025, month-on-month inflation eased to 0.4% in August 2025, a development CZI attributed to the effectiveness of the current tight monetary policy stance in stabilising prices, albeit under constrained liquidity conditions.\n\nIn the long term, monetary policy will need to gradually ease liquidity conditions as stability becomes more sustainable, CZI said.\n\nKeeping inflation below 1% enhances price stability and broadens the use of the ZiG beyond a transaction currency. Businesses that previously preferred USD-only transactions are now slowly encouraging ZiG payments to meet some of their monthly obligations.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nWith no heavyweightopposition candidates cleared to compete in Wednesdays election, many Tanzanians feel the vote is less like a contest and more like a coronation for President Samia Suluhu Hassan, as she faces her first presidential election.\n\nThe 65-year-old became the East African nations first female head of state after the death in 2021 of sitting President John Magufuli. He was admired on the one hand for his no-nonsense drive to stamp out corruption but criticised on the other for his authoritarian clampdown on dissent and controversial attitude towards the Covid pandemic.\n\nPresident Samia, who had been vice-president, seemed like a breath of fresh air  and with her warmer and friendlier style, she initiated reforms that seemed to represent a radical departure from her predecessors policies.\n\nHer four Rs policy  reconciliation, resilience, reform and rebuilding  reopened Tanzania to foreign investors, restored donor relations and mollified the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.\n\nShe made a difference, the lost relationship between Tanzania and international organisations such as World Bank was restored, political analyst Mohammed Issa told the BBC.\n\nBut over the last two years or so, the political space has drastically shrunk  and the targeting of government critics and opposition voices is said to be more ruthless now than it ever was under Magufuli, with regular abductions and killings now reported.\n\nSamia came in with a conciliatory tone, but now she has become bold and makes tough decisions that many did not expect from her, said Mr Issa.\n\nShe is now widely blamed for some things like abductions, killings, repression of opposition and other issues on security.\n\nThis is reflected in reports by Freedom House, a US-based democracy and human rights advocacy group, which ranked Tanzania as partly free in 2020 and not free last year.\n\nThe government has not commented on the allegations.\n\nSamias CCM has won every election since the reintroduction of multi-party democracy in 1992, but the campaigns are usually vibrant with robust debate between the rival parties.\n\nWhile the electoral commission has cleared 17 presidential candidates to stand this time, the main opposition party, Chadema, is barred with its leader, Tundu Lissu, currentlyon trial for treason.\n\nHe had been calling for electoral reforms before his arrest in April  and the party is now urging its supporters to boycott the poll.\n\nHis deputy, John Heche,was also arrested last week and told the BBC just before his detention that President Samias so-called reforms were hollow: Yes, rallies were allowed again, but today Chadema cant do its mandate because the promises were fake.\n\nMeanwhile, presidential hopeful Luhana Mpina, from the second largest opposition party, ACT Wazalendo, has also been disqualified  twice.\n\nHe had managed to get his candidacy reinstated by the High Court after he was barred over a procedural issue  but when the Attorney General appealed last month, the electoral commission decided to uphold the disqualification.\n\nThis leaves smaller opposition parties like Chaumma and CUF in the race, but in reality there is no chance of them stopping Samia winning her first personal mandate.\n\nThe ruling partys control, exclusion of the opposition and institutional bias undermine electoral credibility. Limited civic space and low voter engagement further weaken inclusiveness, said political analyst Nicodemus Minde in a recent report for the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) think-tank.\n\nThis has left some would-be voters, like Dar es Salaam resident Godfrey Lusana, despondent.\n\nWe do not have an election without a strong opposition. The electoral system is not independent. We already know who will win. I cant waste time to vote, he told the BBC. If the electoral commission was really independent, I would have voted.\n\nThe islanders elect their own regional president and incumbent Hussein Mwinyi of the CCM is seeking another term, but faces stiff competition from ACT-Wazalendos Othman Masoud  who has been serving as his deputy in a unity administration.\n\nOn the campaign trail on the mainland, President Samia has capitalised on the initial praise she received for her motherly approach  seeking to govern through dialogue rather than decree.\n\nThis earned her the nickname Mama Samia  and at her rallies she has been promising to bring widespread development through better infrastructure, health and education.\n\nMany women, especially those in rural communities, see her as a stabilising force.\n\nShe brings dignity, we young women look up to her. We feel her presence as the president and that gives us confidence that we can be reliable to our communities now and in the future, first-time voter Queen Castoric from the northern city of Tanga told the BBC.\n\nBut some women in urban areas, like Celina Ponsiana, who will also be casting her ballot for the first time in Dar es Salaam, are more equivocal: Leadership isnt only about tone.\n\nI believe the president has a task to do, first on unemployment. She has been supporting some but many still need help, she said.\n\nAnother young woman in Morogoro, near Dar es Salaam, said she supported the president but refused to give her name to the BBC in case she faced a backlash from her contemporaries.\n\nSamia made us believe women can lead. I would love to say more, but many youth dont talk positively about her, she said.\n\nYoung people make up the majority of Tanzanias 37.7 million people registered voters  and there is anger from some over the presidents silence on issues like the shocking abductions.\n\nAnd while some give credit to President Samia for stabilising the economy, in some quarters there is even nostalgia for Magufuli given the rising reports of corruption.\n\nHer tougher approach of late may come down to several issues.\n\nIn a traditionally male-dominated society, she has faced problems asserting her authority. At recent rallies she has been reminding voters who is boss: Dont forget I am chief of the defence forces.\n\nShe may also feel undermined by colleagues. Within the CCM, there was some opposition to the fact that she became the partys presidential candidate unchallenged.\n\nThere is also a suggestion that she has in fact become the pawn of a powerful network of business tycoons and other influential CCM backers, known colloquially as Mtandao, according to Mr Minde in his ISS report.\n\nInternal [CCM] party democracy has been stifled through an orchestrated move to make President Samia the sole candidate. While this has deepened divisions within the party, a faade of unity is being presented to the public, he said.\n\nIt is believed that Magufuli refused to take orders from the Mtandao, preferring to stick to his own anti-corruption agenda.\n\nMr Minde warns that this has all contributed to a prevailing sense of fear in the East African nation. With the self-censorship of the media and the shrinking of political discourse, public debate has retreated to private conversations and social media.\n\nAnalysts warn that such detachment, especially among young people, could hollow out Tanzanias democracy further  and create problems down the road for President Samia should there not be a big turnout and if protests kick off.\n\nFor Tito Magoti, a lawyer and young political activist, the demands remain simple.\n\nWe want a free Tanzania where anyone has the freedom to speak, he told the BBC.\n\nThe freedom of movement and the freedom to do anything they wish.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has struck off a claim by retired Duly Holdings Limited administrator, Theresa Ruredzo, who was demanding a Ford Everest vehicle as part of her terminal benefits, ruling that the matter belongs in the Labour Court, not the High Court.\n\nJustice Munangati-Manongwa upheld a special plea filed by the vehicle dealer, agreeing that Ruredzos case, though framed as a contractual dispute, was fundamentally rooted in her former employment and thus a labour matter.\n\nIt is evident that the plaintiffs claim, despite its contractual framing, fundamentally relates to the employment relationship and the associated terminal benefits, ruled the judge.\n\nHence, the Labour Court possesses exclusive jurisdiction to resolve such disputes.\n\nRuredzo, who worked for 31 years and two months at Duly Holdings, rising from clerk typist to national administration manager, retired in November 2017. She told the court that the company failed to pay her full terminal benefits and later agreed to compensate her with a Ford Everest to be delivered within five years  a promise she said was never fulfilled.\n\nHer lawyer argued that the case was purely contractual since the agreement to deliver the vehicle was made after her retirement, and therefore outside the Labour Courts reach. He cited previous judgments suggesting that post-employment contracts do not qualify as labour disputes.\n\nBut Duly Holdings countered that Ruredzos demand amounted to a claim for unpaid terminal benefits, squarely falling under labour law. The company argued that the 2013 Constitution and subsequent amendments to the Labour Act gave the Labour Court exclusive jurisdiction over such employment-related claims.\n\nThe plaintiff has brought her claim before the wrong court, the defence argued, relying on a string of Supreme Court decisions affirming that even cleverly framed contractual claims cannot escape the Labour Courts authority.\n\nJustice Priscilla Munangati-Manongwa agreed, noting that while Ruredzo tried to repackage her claim as a private contract, the car in question was undeniably part of her terminal benefits.\n\nThe agreement for the delivery of the Ford Everest motor vehicle is intrinsically linked to the employment relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant, the judge said. This brings the claim squarely within the jurisdiction of the Labour Court.\n\nThe court upheld Duly Holdings special plea and ordered Ruredzo to pay costs.\n\nRuredzos long-running fight for her promised Ford Everest is now likely to continue before the Labour Court, the only forum legally empowered to decide whether Duly Holdings must finally deliver the vehicle.\n\n",
