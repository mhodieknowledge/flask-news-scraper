            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nThe controversial Broadcasting Services Amendment Act of 2025 has come into effect and is now being implemented by the Zimbabwe National Road Authority (ZINARA), with potentially crippling consequences for vehicle owners.\n\nThe crux of the problem lies in Clause 15 of the Act, which mandates that all motorists must obtain a valid ZBC radio licence before they can renew their ZINARA vehicle licence and insurance. This effectively forces drivers to pay US$30 per term to access ZBC radio services, regardless of whether they listen.\n\nFor motorists, this translates to a minimum additional cost of US$90 per term just to keep their vehicles roadworthy  a hefty sum that many fear will force them to disable their car radios or seek exemption certificates in an attempt to avoid the added expense.\n\nIn a memorandum dated 15th July 2025, ZINARAs Revenue Operations Director, Mr P.M. Shuro issued strict instructions to all licensing centre staff across the country. The directive is clear: no motorist will be permitted to renew their vehicle licence without first presenting a valid ZBC radio licence or a certificate of exemption.\n\nIn line with the enacted Broadcasting Services Amendment Act, all motorists are required to obtain a ZBC radio license before they can renew their vehicle insurance or acquire a ZINARA vehicle licence disc, the memorandum states.\n\nZINARA has, however, placed the onus on motorists to obtain exemption certificates themselves by visiting ZBC licensing offices nationwide.\n\nCustomers whose vehicles are not equipped with a radio receiver are now required to obtain an exemption certificate from the ZBC. They will need to personally visit any ZBC Licensing Office to complete the necessary declaration form and obtain this exemption. We cannot process their ZINARA disc or insurance renewal until they present a valid exemption certificate, Mr Shuros statement continues.\n\nThe Broadcasting Services Amendment Act has been a source of fierce debate since its inception. Public hearings last year generated significant opposition, and even after President Emmerson Mnangagwa signed the bill into law in March this year, the controversy has continued.\n\nMedia freedom advocates, including the Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) and its partners, such as the Media Alliance of Zimbabwe (MAZ), lobbied in vain for Information Minister Jenfan Muswere to withdraw the bill before it was enacted, urging him to take public feedback into account.\n\nThe primary point of contention centres on Clause 15.\n\nCritics and analysts have argued that the Act is discriminatory, singling out motorists while allowing all citizens to access ZBC radio services through digital devices like mobile phones, without incurring this additional charge.\n\nThe new law is viewed by many as an unfair tax, further burdening already financially stretched citizens.\n\n",

            "content": "By Leopold Munhende recently in Binga\n\nWITH his wife seated on the carrier and their one-year-old son on her back, Honest Mudenda (28) cycled 10 kilometres on a perry bike to register a birth certificate last Wednesday, a two-hour ride through dense forests lined with all manner of wild animals found along Lake Kariba.\n\nOnly those who witnessed the couples smiles would understand how something so ordinary, so simple for most urbanites, can make a villager in far-flung Siamusanga, Binga happy.\n\nThe Mudenda family is one of many villagers in hard to reach areas that have benefited from a Civil Registration Department (CRD) led, Swedish government-funded and UNICEF-supported initiative to register birth certificates, national identity cards and death certificates.\n\nWearing brightly lit smiles, Mudenda said they were confident the certificate would change fortunes for their baby.\n\nThey live at Mujere Fishing Camp, some 198km from Binga Centre, on the shores of Lake Kariba, where internet is a luxury, radio signal is yet to reach and Zambia is a herd mans whistle away.\n\nThat Siamusanga is hard to reach is not up for discussion.\n\nElephants roam freely on the shores of the mighty Lake Kariba, and leopards and lions are not a rare sight too deep amongst the Tonga-speaking communities there.\n\nHonest Mudenda, a beneficiary of the ongoing programme, called for it to extend to their fishing camps that are also hard to reach.\n\nI never believed that one day my child would have a birth certificate. A lot of people in our community do not have these documents because there is nowhere to get them and Binga Centre is too far for them to travel to, said a visibly happy Mudenda.\n\nThere is no transport to get here from the fishing camp I work at, I for one used a bicycle to get here with my wife and child on the carrier, cautiously riding through forests which are usually full of wild animals.\n\nWe hope this programme continues so as to benefit more people; if it is possible, they can actually visit our camps too.\n\nBefore the satellite registration centre was opened, villagers had to travel 183km to Binga Centre, a distance that would be short were it tarred.\n\nIt is, however, a gruelling seven-hour drive, and costs no less than US$15 when using public transport, which is a fortune for simple fishermen.\n\nThe only public transport they know of is a ZUPCO bus that plies their route twice a week, on Wednesdays and Sundays, and even then, it does not get anywhere near Siamusanga. Its route ends about 60km from Siamusanga, at Chunga Growth Point.\n\n39-year-old Norah Mende, who proudly brandished her fifth childs new birth certificate, called for authorities to consider building a registry office closer to their remote villages.\n\nThe process is so smooth, I now have my sons birth certificate, have changed my ID and gotten my picture taken, said Mende with a giddy laugh. She walked four kilometres to the centre.\n\nThis facility should not leave this area because a lot of people do not have these documents and without it, we have to go to Siabuwa or Binga. Our children need these documents to attend school and write examinations, now consider that children are born every year.\n\nA young lady giving details as officials take them down to process her first ever identify card at Siamusanga Primary School.\n\nBinga, just like Mwenezi, is considered a hard-to-reach area, where villagers and animals share resources, clash often, and far more depressing, where basic services are hardly accessible.\n\nThere is 150km of partially tarred road between Cross Dete (along the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls highway) and Binga, most of which is a strip of a potholed former road.\n\nThe place is so far flung, Zambia could easily have claimed it and most Zimbabweans would not know of it.\n\nUp until the Zimbabwean, Swedish governments, and UNICEFs recent intervention, tens of thousands lived and died without having procured a birth certificate or national identity document, not for a shortage of need but access.\n\nThis is part of a broader programme that the CRD is embarking on in collaboration with UNICEF, where we are going around eight rural provinces of Zimbabwe targeting hard-to-reach areas to issue birth, death certificates and national IDs, said Christina Chikerema, the CRDs Deputy Registrar General in Charge of Operations.\n\nBy targeting hard-to-reach areas, we are ensuring that we leave no one and no place behind. So far, we have been to Chikombedzi (Masvingo Province), Mhangura (Mashonaland West) and Mangwe (Matabeleland South).\n\nOur partnership with the Swedish government and development partners such as UNICEF is very key in this programme.\n\nTraditional leaders also have been roped in the drive that has seen them taking on the responsibility to teach their communities on the process, encourage them to take identity documents and also register births that occur within their areas.\n\n",
