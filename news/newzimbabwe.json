They tabled a comprehensive set of recommendations to SADC Heads of State and Government, meeting this week.\n\nAmong the proposals were harmonising laws across statutory, religious, and customary systems to enforce the minimum marriage age of 18 without exceptions, establishing an Anti-Child Marriage Fund to finance survivor protection programmes such as safe homes, counselling, and reintegration services and\n\nEnsuring free healthcare, education, legal aid, and psychosocial support for survivors among other recommendations.\n\nThese recommendations emphasise the need for political will, legal clarity, survivor-centred services, community ownership, and adequate funding, the panel concluded.\n\nEquality Now, which has been campaigning against child marriage since 1995, stressed that regional governments must urgently align with the SADC Model Law on Eradicating Child Marriage, the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child, and the Maputo Protocol.\n\nBy adopting and implementing these measures, SADC leaders can accelerate the eradication of child marriage, protect survivors, and uphold the rights and dignity of children across the region, the organisation said.\n\n",

We need some formal jobs so that we can leave the streets. Its difficult to remain in-doors at home when you have no basics such as food, Rudo Murotsi of Mufakose said.One Leroy Kufa from Glen View Area 8, a university graduate from Class of 2015, said he had never been employed after leaving college, turning to vending since then but had managed to send his siblings to school.So, how are we going to survive? Kufa asked rhetorically.During the 2024 Local Authorities Performance Outcome feed back workshop in Harare last Thursday, Garwe reiterated the ban and ordered council officials countrywide to make sure that all cities, towns and growth points chuck off vendors by December this year.Lets just accept that we created these problems. We must be able to deal with these problems. We want to see clean cities.I want to see all the cities clean. I dont know how we are going to do it. At least by the end of this year, our cities must be clean.Everybody must be willing to come to Harare, to come to ulawayo, to go to Mutare, to go to Masvingo, from wherever they are outside our country. Lets clean our cities. This is our motto., Garwe said.Lets reintroduce the culture of cleanliness to citizens.And we also want to know that street vending and night vending are banned. Street vending and night vending are born out of the importation of second-hand clothing, which is banned. And the responsibility to remove these people from our streets and from operating at night is ours, said added.The minister took a swipe at night-vending alleging only abuse of drugs and substances takes place during the evenings along the streets of the capital city.There is no positive night vending that is taking place. Its all drugs and substance abuse behind that night vending.Who, in his rightful of mind, or in her rightful of mind, will wake up at 12 midnight or 1am and say to the wife, Im leaving, you know, Im going for shopping at 1am. Or a woman leaving her husband or boyfriend to say, look, Im sorry, I have to go. Im going for shopping now. There is nobody. So this narrative that people have nothing to do, we are messing up people, its all hogwash.We must make hard and tough decisions to clean these cities. There must be tough decisions. Both tough decisions, positive results will come out, he added.So, there is banning of second-hand clothing importation, subsequent banning of street vending, and subsequent banning of night vending.These are directives that are coming from His Excellency. We actually have a Statutory lnstrument through the Minister of Industry and Commerce to ban the importationWe dont need that anymore. We cant be in a country, or an area cant be defined by seeing people selling used clothes along the streets.Garwe said Zimbabwe cannot be a nation of people aspiring to wear second-hand clothing, adding the importation and sale of used clothes was killing the countrys cotton industry.\n\nWe are unemployed.
