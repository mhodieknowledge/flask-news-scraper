            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nINHABITANTS of Mberengwa in Midlands province have commended Sandawana Mines for recently enlisting a group of 26 locals to undertake road rehabilitation work.\n\nThe lithium miner has created several jobs over the past and according to local villagers, hundreds of locals were once employed but ended up losing their jobs when the company responded to reduced lithium prices on the global market.\n\nDespite a constrained operating environment, stakeholders have commended the miner for the recent job offers after Sandawanas move to employ 26 locals. The newly recruited group is tasked with the responsibility to work on the dust road for a monthly payment on very flexible terms.\n\nInformation obtained by our publication from the workers shows that they are allowed to attend to the road after completing their daily household chores and even at comfortable timeframes which they decide on.\n\nSpeaking on the latest developments on the sidelines of the Silveira House organised district impact assessment dialogue, Mberengwa Ward 10 Councillor, Chenjerai Shoko described the companys efforts as tilted towards community uplifting.\n\nSandawana Mine recent move to offer the roads rehab jobs to youths was a noble gesture. The initiative has significantly eased drugs and substance abuses.\n\nThe funds they are earning are also going a long way to fend for their families and shore up the local economic activities as they end up supporting downstream economic activities, he said.\n\nShoko also revealed that just recently, the company supported two awareness campaigns on sexual harassment and Gender Based Violence (GBV), which have gone a long way to eradicate vices whereby boys in the community were chasing after the young girls.\n\nFetty Gumbo, the headman for Mawovere Village, also commended the company for the people centered initiatives.\n\nThe companys pro-people approach continues to spread across the breadth and length of the Midlands Province, serving as a good example of best practices to fellow miners.\n\nThe initiative has gone a long way to revamp infrastructure while empowering the community at the same time, he said.\n\nSandawana is a member of Kuvimba Mining House and is expected to float more jobs and support the community with other initiatives once the internal financial situation improves.\n\n",

He was a good man. Who will do everything he did for us now?\n\nThe police are working on this case, and in this country nothing of this nature goes unpunished. Justice will be served. This will not simply end, the culprits will be brought to book, and the truth will come out no matter what, Machakaire said.\n\nAccording to police, seven masked suspects armed with pistols, crowbars, and hammers overpowered a security guard manning Mutangaduras house. They tied him up and forced him to the farmhouse, which they broke into using metal bars.\n\nThe suspects then forced the guard and Mutangaduras son to lie down in the dining room before proceeding to the victims bedroom, where he was sleeping with his wife.\n\nThey shot him in the stomach, ransacked the house and fled.\n\nMutangadura and his wife were later found unconscious.\n\nHe died from his injuries, while his wife survived.\n\nMeanwhile police investigations are still underway, and no arrests have been made yet.\n\n",
