            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nZIMBABWEs foreign currency receipts reached a whopping US$7.3 billion during the years first half period, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) latest Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) has revealed.\n\nPresenting the Mid-Term Budget Review this week, RBZ governor Dr John Mushayavanhu said total foreign currency receipts for the period January to June 30, 2025, amounted to US$7.3 billion compared to US$5.9 billion received during the same period in 2024 representing a 23.1% increase.\n\nThe foreign receipts were against foreign payments amounting to US$5.0 billion, a 17% increase from US$4.3 billion reported during the same period in 2024.\n\nIn line with increased foreign currency inflows during the first half of 2025, the countrys current account balance is expected to improve from a surplus of US$501.2 million in 2024 to a surplus of US$621.7 million in 2025. The projected surplus will continue to be supported by improvements in merchandise exports and remittances, he said.\n\nThe MPS shows that the financial soundness metrics indicate that the banking sector is safe and sound despite some issues of prudential concern at a few institutions.\n\nAs at June 30, 2025, 17 out of 19 banking institutions reported core capital above the minimum regulatory capital requirements and the non-performing loans ratio stood at 2.89% compared to 3.37% as at 31 December 2024.\n\nOfficial records also show that during the same period, remittances rose to US$635,2 million signaling a 7,1% increase compared to the same period last year.\n\nTo year end, remittances are projected to increase by 4.9% from US$2.6 billion in 2024 to US$2.7 billion in 2025, sustaining a positive current account balance. Given the strategic importance of the diaspora community, the Government seeks to strengthen their role in the development of the country.\n\n",

According to the ministry, localised person-to-person transmission has been documented, often through household contact and healthcare-associated exposure, particularly in settings lacking appropriate protective measures.\n\nThe WHO is reporting ongoing outbreaks across Africa, including some Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries, raising fears of cross-border spread.\n\nThis poses a heightened risk of cross-border transmission, the ministry cautioned.\n\nIn response, Zimbabwe has scaled up disease surveillance and reinforced screening measures at all Points of Entry (PoEs).\n\nThe ministry urged the public to strictly follow WHO-recommended preventive measures, warning including avoiding physical contact with individuals showing symptoms of Mpox, sharing clothes, bedding and towels among other things.\n\nThe ministry also encouraged the public to be vigilant and act swiftly if they suspect infection. Members of the public are encouraged to report any suspected cases to the nearest health facility promptly, it said.\n\nMpox spreads primarily through close contact and can cause fever, rash, and swollen lymph nodes, sometimes leading to severe illness.\n\n",

However, Justice Kudya found that only one of the grounds had merit and upheld the rest of the arbitrators findings.\n\nThe employer clearly aprobated and reprobated by writing in the probation contract that it did not intend to extend it, yet it was doing exactly that which it said it did not intend to do, the judge ruled.\n\nThe dispute arose when the school employed Madziva on a fixed-term probation contract, which was due to expire on 31 March 2023.\n\nOn that very day, the school issued a notice stating it would not be extending her contract.\n\nThe arbitrator ruled that this amounted to unlawful termination and awarded damages, prompting the appeal.\n\nKudya criticised the colleges handling of the matter, stating, Had the employer indeed intended to give notice for the termination of the probation contract, it should have done so before its expiration.  It was not remiss for the arbitrator to conclude that once parties were in the April to December phase of the contract, they were now operating in the main contract.\n\nHe added that the colleges attempt to treat the contract as terminated while simultaneously letting it roll into the next phase of employment cannot pass the unreasonableness test laid out in Hama v NRZ.\n\nOn the matter of prejudice, the court noted that unfair dismissal need not be measured by harm suffered.\n\nPrejudice is indeed not a prerequisite to find unlawful termination, Kudya said, affirming the arbitrators position that the dismissal was inherently unfair.\n\nAddressing the employers objection to the damages awarded in US dollars, the court reaffirmed Zimbabwes multi-currency framework.\n\nThere was nothing remiss by making the order which the arbitrator made.  If the employer wants to pay what was ordered using the rate of the local currency at the date of payment, nothing stops it from doing so.\n\nThe judge further dismissed the employers contention that the arbitrator had wrongly quantified the damages.\n\nIt was unnecessary to try to find out what was due when it was apparent on the contract. The res ipsa loquitur principle applies.\n\nThe judge upheld the appeal relating to the employees classification as permanent.\n\nHe ruled that the arbitral award stands, but with the correction that Madziva was not a permanent employee.\n\nWatershed College Trust was ordered to pay costs on the ordinary scale.\n\n",
