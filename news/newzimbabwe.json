I think thats what is just needed at the moment and it is what was needed since the beginning of the season.If we are to win on Sunday, I am sure it will be difficult to stop it.Both Dynamos and CAPS United face each other at their lowest. Dembare is currently 16th on the log with eight points, one behind Makepekepe which is on position 14.Chaminuka added that both sides are at the same level heading into Sundays game.I think that places us at par, my counterpart also arrived just recently.I dont think we would have done much as far as, you know, changing what has been going on at both our clubs.I also think that this is the time that players will respond to what you will be giving them, he added.Sundays match will be Ian Bakalas second match in charge of CAPS United, who started with a 1-1 draw against Herentals last week.\n\nChaminuka joined Dembare Tuesday amid of a poor run, which has seen the side winning only one game in 11 encounters.\n\nThe former Black Rhinos and Green Fuel gaffer was appointed Dynamos coach coming from bottom-placed Kwekwe United.Speaking ahead of the clash against old rivals CAPS United, Chaminuka expressed his wish to bag three points come Sunday.If it were my wish, I would have wanted to win Sundays game.This will bring a lot of confidence among the boys.

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nFIRM gold prices on the global markets almost doubled Caledonia Mining Corporations Plc (CMC) profits to US$26,9 million resulting in a 48% gross margin.\n\nSince the beginning of the year,market data shows that gold prices increased by 22,7% to date driven by increased safe-haven demand due to global economic and geopolitical uncertainty, central bank purchases, a weakening dollar, and concerns about inflation. Limited gold supply and its growing utility in various industries are also contributing to the price surge.Local miner,Caledonia says during the first quarter period ,revenue and Profit Revenue was US$56.2 million, a 46% increase from $38.5 million in Q1 2024 driven by higher sales and a 42% increase in the average realised gold price to $2,896 per ounce.Gross profit nearly doubled to $26.9 million (Q1 2024: $13.8 million), resulting in a gross margin of 48% (Q1 2024: 36%). This reflects the benefit of higher gold prices, which more than offset the increase in production costs, the miner said.During the period, Net profit attributable to shareholders increased nearly six times to US$8,9 million (Q1 2024: $1.5 million), while adjusted EPS rose to 58.5 cents from 9.7 cents in Q1 2024. On-mine cost per ounce increased by 12.9% to $1,202 (Q1 2024: $1,065), primarily due to higher labour, power and consumables costs at Blanket Mine.Cash Flow Net cash from operating activities more than doubled to $13.3 million (Q1 2024: $4.9 million), providing strong internal funding for capital investments and debt reduction. The net cash position improved to negative US$4,6 million at quarter-end, compared to negative $14,2 million in Q1 2024.Following the completion of the solar plant sale in April 2025, Caledonias pro forma consolidated net cash position improved to $18.6 million, providing financial flexibility for future growth initiativesCaledonia CEO Mark Learmonth also attributed the strong performance to the miners resilient management style.Caledonia has delivered an exceptional first quarter with gold production up 9.3% and gross profit nearly doubling to US$26,9 million compared to the same period last year. This strong performance demonstrates our operational resilience and ability to capitalise on favorable gold prices, he said.The miners CEO said the successful completion of the solar plant sale for $22.35 million has significantly strengthened our balance sheet, positioning us well to accelerate our growth plans at Bilboes and Motapa whilst investing to achieve operational improvements and efficiencies at Blanket Mine.As we move forward in 2025, we remain focused on three strategic priorities: maximising profitable production at Blanket, optimising the economics of the Bilboes project, and unlocking the exploration potential at Motapa. I am confident that our disciplined approach to capital allocation and strategic growth will continue to deliver strong returns for our shareholders, added Learmonth.\n\nSince the beginning of the year,market data shows that gold prices increased by 22,7% to date driven by increased safe-haven demand due to global economic and geopolitical uncertainty, central bank purchases, a weakening dollar, and concerns about inflation.

Chahwanda Stadium in Kwekwe.\n\nSidat visited the stadium together with Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) infrastructure board chair Brighton Ushendibaba and other delegates.Also known as The Heart Main Arena, Chahwanda Stadium is being built by football benefactor prophet Walter Magaya, together with his partner Shephered Chahwanda.From our side, we are overally satisfied with the visit and hopefully in the coming period of time this articulation and partnership regards to the project can continue, said Sidat.The new stadium which is expected to have a carrying capacity of 10,000 fascinated Sidat with its state-of-the-art circle-shaped changing rooms inspired by those at Manchester Citys Eithad Stadium.The two dressing rooms are good, according to my experience with other stadiums I have not seen such in many other top tier stadiums.For example, having a round circle dressing room, its going to be really a fantastic place where the top players can enjoy you know being in this area as part of the pre-match, he added.Chahwanda Stadium is expected to be completed before end of July and Sidats visit was to guide the ongoing construction to meet CAF requirements.Stadia

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nZIMBABWE-CHINA relations continue to grow, and this weeks visit to China by Parliament Speaker Jacob Mudenda revealed a strong bond between the two nations as they continue to work together in various sectors, benefitting both economies.\n\nThe Speaker, who led a parliamentary delegation on a bilateral visit to China last Monday met with the Chinese Peoples Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) chairman Wang Huning and commended China for the many initiatives that have benefitted Zimbabwe.The discussions held Tuesday reflected on ways to strengthen the existing excellent relations between Zimbabwe and China, anchored on the five-star ironclad cooperation framework as enunciated by President Emmerson Mnangagwa and the Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2024.Huning told Mudenda and his delegation that he held a strong appreciation of Zimbabwes struggle for independence and admiration for the gallant heroes and heroines, who defeated the racist white settler regime in the then Rhodesia.In his speech, Huning applauded the sound and robust relations between the two countries, which he described as deep rooted in the struggle and have stood the test of time.Huning commended Mnangagwas State visit to China, which took place on the backdrop of the FOCAC Summit and culminated in the strategic five-star ironclad development cooperation framework for China and Zimbabwe.The State visit and the outcomes thereof are clear testimony of the commitment by the two Presidents to strengthen existing socio-economic cooperation for sustainable development.H.E Huning lauded the two sisterly Republics for supporting each others development initiatives as well as shared core positions on the international for a, Wang said.Mudenda celebrated the 45th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Zimbabwe and China, acknowledging the critical role played by China in supporting the liberation struggle through providing the much-needed military training for cadres to effectively prosecute the liberation war.Mudenda opined that it was befitting that China was one of the first countries to establish diplomatic relations with Zimbabwe soon after the latters independence in 1980.The Speaker extolled the Chinese government for the tendered support and cooperation in various sectors of the economy, including infrastructure, where the landmark grant extended to the government culminated in the construction of the impressive New Parliament Building.Zimbabwe has received support in the energy sector through renovation works done at Kariba South hydropower generation and the construction of the Hwange 7 and 8 unit thermal power station, which have significantly enhanced the power supply in the country.I have noted that there is still a debilitating energy deficit and, in this context, there is scope for China to collaborate with Zimbabwe through investments in renewable energy to close this energy gap to accelerate the industrialisation efforts of the Second Republic, Mudenda said.He called for strengthened relations commensurate with the existing excellent relations at the Executive and political party levels.Through parliamentary exchanges, Zimbabwe stands to benefit from the vibrant laws, especially on the establishment of special economic zones to facilitate the ease of doing business.The Speaker extended an invitation to Huning to undertake a bilateral visit to Zimbabwe on mutually agreeable dates which he accepted.The two legislatures and Zimbabwes delegation, which included Zimbabwes Foreign Affairs and International Trade Parliamentary chairperson Webster Shamu, toured China Railway International Group and the Great Wall of China, among other notable sites in Beijing.Huning added; China pledges to continue supporting Zimbabwe in its fight against the illegal sanctions imposed by the West as well as safeguarding the countrys sovereignty and territorial integrity and cooperation in various sectors of the economy including agriculture, mining, renewable energy and infrastructure development.He promised to promote cooperation in the emerging digital technologies driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the desire for green energy development for a sustainable, clean environment, guaranteeing safety of Chinese nationals and security of property rights in the host country and cooperation in the field of culture, health, tourism, education, youth and women empowerment.China has made great progress in poverty alleviation by implementing policies that improve peoples livelihoods and setting targeted poverty alleviation programmes.Through government initiatives, 88 million people have been lifted from poverty in the past 10 years, with one such success story as the Gansu Province, which has witnessed remarkable development through targeted poverty alleviation initiatives.Mudenda on the other hand, highlighted that he had been following with keen interest Chinas economic development, guided by the resolve to alleviate poverty among its citizens, where the issue was debated back home in Zimbabwe as MPs demanded to know what policies and reforms were in place to reduce high poverty and unemployment levels.Globally, Speaker Mudenda welcomed the ongoing negotiations and diplomatic efforts to resolve the fight for a fair-trade ecosystem among nations.Mudenda, arrived in Beijing, China, on Monday, May 12, 2025 for a five-day working parliamentary bilateral visit.The visit was at the behest of his counterpart, His Excellency, Zhao Leji,

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nLISTED financial powerhouse, FBC Bank, has blamed the tight policy measures employed by the Central Bank for significantly choking transaction volumes at the institution.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) pledged to maintain a tight monetary policy stance throughout the year to stabilise its newly introduced currency by keeping the key interest rates at 35%. A tight grip on liquidity has also been maintained since then.\n\nPresenting a trading update for the quarter ended March 31 2025, FBC group company secretary, Tichaona Mabeza, said while the measures have gone a long way to support stability, business volumes were severely affected.\n\nLocally, Zimbabwes economy experienced relative stability concerning inflation and exchange rates, despite the global macroeconomic pressures. This is because of a tight monetary policy stance that aims to foster market stability, enhance market confidence and provide a basis for sustainable growth. The tight monetary policy stance has, however, adversely impacted the volume of transactions and lending activities, said Mabeza.\n\nOn the other hand, FBC said tight liquidity conditions also adversely affected trading on the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE), resulting in the All-Share index dropping by 5.7%\n\nMeanwhile ,during the period, the group reported a profit before tax of ZWG 94.5 million. Total income stood at ZWG 578 million, with net fee and commission income contributing ZWG 337 million, highlighting the groups strategic pivot towards fee-based revenue, to reduce exposure to currency and interest rate volatility.\n\nNet interest income remained robust at ZWG 321 million, demonstrating the continued strength of core trading activities. Total assets amounted to ZWG 19.9 billion, underpinned by a strong loan portfolio of ZWG 9.56 billion.\n\nShareholders equity closed at ZWG 5. 7 billion, reflecting the Groups ongoing focus on safeguarding and growing long-term shareholder value.\n\nLocally, the current tight fiscal and monetary policy positions will likely remain until the macroeconomic targets are within range. The Group will prioritise efficient capital deployment, pursue growth opportunities in key economic sectors and improve operational efficiency, driven by innovation and technology investments, added Mabeza.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Supreme Court has struck off the roll appeals by Sengezo Tshabangu and the Speaker of Parliament, who were challenging a High Court ruling blocking the recall of legislators from the Citizens Coalition for Coalition (CCC) faction led by Welshman Ncube.\n\nThis follows a realisation that there was no court order on the ruling from the lower court.\n\nA bench comprising Justices Chinembiri Bhunu, Felistas Chatukuta and Lavender Makoni struck the appeals off the roll, ruling that the matter should be heard afresh.\n\nHaving considered submissions by counsel, the court issues the following order.\n\nThe matter on Sc24/25 and SC 26/25be and are hereby struck off the roll (appeal by the Speaker of the National Assembly and the appeal by Tshabangu).\n\nIn the exercise of this courts review powers it is ordered that the proceedings in the High Court be and is hereby set aside.\n\nThe matter is hereby remitted to the court a quo (High Court) for hearing de novo before a different judge, Bhunu.\n\nWhen court sat on Thursday a lawyer representing CCC, Method Ndlovu challenged the courts jurisdiction, arguing that the case was supposed to be heard by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe hearing, however, took a twist after it emerged that there was no written court order from the High Court formalising its ruling.\n\nOnce there is no order, then there is no appeal. You cannot make an appeal on an order which does not exist. The court cannot panel beat a judgement from the court a quo to make it fit the record, said Ndlovu.\n\nLewis Uriri, representing Tshabangu, agreed that there was no judgment from the High Court.\n\nHe then said without that court order the Supreme Court had powers to set aside the judgment of the High Court.\n\nThe prayer that we seek is that the appeal succeeds and the judgment of the High Court is set aside and remitted back to the High Court.\n\nThere is no operative part of the judgement as such we do not have an appeal. So may the court remit back the matter to the High Court de novo with a different judge, he said.\n\nThe court ruled in Uriris favour.\n\nCommenting on the development, Uriri said. In essence, the High Court wrote an essay.\n\nBecause we have an issue, which is not a speaking judgment, those proceedings have been set aside, and the matter has been returned to the High Court for a fresh hearing before a different judge.\n\nNdlovu begged to differ, The two appeals were not properly before the court because they were appealing against an order which did not exist. The Supreme Court stated that the High Courts judgment did not provide a disposition or an operative part. The appeals were struck off the roll, with each party bearing its own costs. The matter was remitted to the High Court to be heard by a different judge. The dispute remains very live. Justice Wamambo had declared the reshuffling of the Committee on Standing Rules and Orders unlawful, and that matter will now be heard afresh. No one won.\n\nLast year, CCC leaders, including the interim party leader, Welshman Ncube and his deputy, Lynette Karenyi Kore, Sesel Zvidzai and Edwin Mushoriwa, filed an application citing their party as the first applicant.\n\nTshabangu had dismissed the leaders from their parliamentary roles and appointed his selections in their place.\n\nAs a result, they sued Tshabangu and Mlotshwa, seeking a court declaration that Tshabangus decisions to oust them from the Standing Rules and Orders Committee (SROC) were unlawful and exceeded his constitutional authority.\n\nThey also challenged Mlotshwas appointment as the CCC chief whip, claiming that such a position is not recognised under Section 151 (2) of the Constitution.\n\nThey also said the reshuffling of various CCC members across different parliamentary committees to which they were originally assigned.\n\nThey sought an order to prevent the Speaker from announcing these changes in the National Assembly.\n\nTheir challenge was upheld by High Court judge Justice Neville Wamambo, prompting Tshabangu to approach the Supreme Court.\n\n",

Care workers from overseas have made a huge contribution, but too many have been subject to abuse and exploitation, the UK Home Office announced via its official X account on May 12.Were moving away from our dependence on overseas workers to restore control and fairness to the system.\n\nIndia, Nigeria and Zimbabwe have been the three biggest sources of care workers migrating to the UK since it began offering them such visas. According to UK Home Office data, 15,709 care-worker visas were issued to Zimbabwean nationals in 2023, while Nigerians received 19,449, including dependents.\n\nThe visa cancellation is part of a wider clampdown on immigration under Prime Minister Keir Starmers government, which is facing increasing pressure to reduce migrant numbers amid growing support for anti-immigration parties like Nigel Farages Reform UK, according toBloomberg.\n\nFor many Zimbabweans, the permits had offered a lifeline, an opportunity to escape an economy marked by instability and inflation. Over the years, Zimbabwes currency has been one of the worlds worst performers.\n\nThe countrys latest attempt at monetary stability, thegold-backed ZiG, marks its sixth currency experiment in just 15 years. Despite its promise, the ZiG has yet to gain meaningful traction. In September, the central bank devalued the ZiG by 43% to narrow the gulf between official and black-market exchange rates.\n\nThe migration surge has triggered a significant brain drain in Zimbabwe, depleting the country of skilled professionals, not only in health care but also across critical sectors such as banking, accounting, and information technology, said Memory Nguwi, managing consultant at Industrial Psychology Consultants, a Harare-based HR advisory firm.\n\nZimbabwean authorities have raised concerns that the exodus of nurses and doctors to the UK has created a severe gap in the countrys already fragile healthcare system.\n\n",

The disputed additional assessments amount to US$74.8 million.\n\nManagement continues to engage with ZIMRA while appealing some legal and factual issues of the assessments and the judgments, with guidance from tax experts and legal counsel. These assessments have a material impact on the Groups operations, if they materialise as per the extant assessments, he said.\n\nMoyo described the ambiguities in the tax legislation as pervasive, thereby creating risks of further disagreements in interpretations and application to current taxes.\n\nMeanwhile, during the period, group revenue for the year at US$807 million increased by 5% compared to the restated prior year figures, reflecting the volume growth in Lager Beer and the sugar tax-induced price increases in sparkling beverages.\n\nThe proportion of domestic sales undertaken in foreign currency was around 80% for most of the year, although there were periodic shifts in response to the performance of the formal retail sector, which was affected by exchange rate disparities and the level of enforcement of the dual pricing regulations.\n\nOperating Income (Earnings before interest and tax) is indicated at US$153 million, which is in line with the prior year. Profit before tax is indicated at US$139.9 million compared to US$104.4 million for the prior year. It is noted that the prior year comparative figures included currency-related distortions.\n\nThe trading margins in the current period were partly affected by the under recovery on the sugar tax and the higher cost of imported maize. It is highlighted that an equivalent of US$20.7 million was paid as sugar tax by Delta Beverages and Schweppes Zimbabwe during the current year.\n\nThe operating environment in Zimbabwe remains complex, influenced by policy changes and currency instability. The beverages sector faces further challenges relating to uncompetitive retail prices arising from high input costs and taxes which attract lower-priced imports from the region and policy-driven changes to the route to market.\n\nWe continue to urge the authorities to implement policies that would ensure the stability of the local currency and access to foreign currency through the banking channels or through trading, added Moyo.\n\n",
