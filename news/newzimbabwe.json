            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA man accused of fatally assaulting another in Damofalls last December has been ordered to stand trial after the High Court refused to dismiss his case, ruling that the State had established a prima facie case against him.\n\nJustice Gibson Mandaza dismissed Wairo Wairos application for discharge at the close of the States case, saying evidence from witnesses linked him directly to the death of David Sengai, who died after being severely beaten.\n\nAt this stage of the proceedings, the simple question is: on the record, is there evidence against the accused person which requires a reply from him? I take the view that indeed there is evidence before the court, the judge said.\n\nWairo is charged with murder under section 47(1) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act. Prosecutors allege that on 23 December 2023, Wairo and three accomplices assaulted Sengai with open hands and fists, causing head injuries from which he later died.\n\nKey witness Noleen Goro, who once dated the accused, told the court she saw Wairo slapping Sengai so hard he fell to the ground while others dragged him by his shirt. She later called a passerby, Tafadzwa Paundi, to help the victim.\n\nDefence lawyers attacked Goros credibility, calling her a self-confessed alcoholic, but the judge found her testimony consistent with that of the investigating officer and Paundi. Calling her names does not detract from her testimony, which is consistent, Mandaza J ruled.\n\nThe judge stressed that at this stage the State was only required to show a prima facie case, not proof beyond reasonable doubt. Once a prima facie case has been established, the evidential burden will shift to the accused to adduce evidence in order to escape conviction, he said.\n\nThe trial will now proceed to the defence case, with Wairo expected to answer to the murder charge.\n\n",

The potential buyer of the land, believed to be Collins Mnangagwa, is constructing a multi-storey building in the area and intends to close part of the public road.\n\nThe residents have been given a month to lodge objections and reasons with the City Council regarding the land.\n\nThe Highlands Residents Association has, via a petition, objected to the sale of the portion of the road by the City Council.\n\nWe, the undersigned residents and community members of Highlands and surrounding areas, hereby submit our formal objection to the proposed permanent road closure of a portion of Otto Road (i.e. Otto Drive, being the road connecting Willowmead Lane to Collins Avenue hereinafter referred to as Otto Road as per the public notice), Highlands, Harare, as advertised in the Public Notice placed in The Herald on Tuesday 2 September 2025, read the petition.\n\nThe residents lashed out at the City Council for the lack of transparency in the process, arguing that the sale of the land deprives the public of the benefits it carries.\n\nOtto Road is public land. Its permanent closure and subsequent sale would deprive current and future residents of their right to access and benefit from public infrastructure.\n\nOtto Road provides a safe and established route for domestic workers, security guards, gardeners, pedestrians, cyclists, schoolchildren, walkers and joggers. Closing it will force vulnerable users onto busier, more dangerous routes.\n\nMany people who rely on Otto Road do not own cars. Closure would disproportionately harm women, children, and low-income workers who depend on safe non-motorised routes.\n\nThe proposed closure appears to serve private interests at the expense of the broader community. Council has a duty to uphold transparency and protect public assets for collective benefit, read the petition.\n\n",
