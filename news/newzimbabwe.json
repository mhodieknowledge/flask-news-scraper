            "content": "By Lauran Neergaard I Associated Press\n\nTHE U.S. has approved the worlds only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV, the first step in an anticipated global rollout that could protect millions  although its unclear how many in the U.S. and abroad will get access to the powerful new option.\n\nWhile a vaccine to prevent HIV still is needed, some experts say the shot made by Gilead Sciences  a drug called lenacapavir  could be the next best thing. It nearly eliminated new infections in two groundbreaking studies of people at high risk, better than daily preventive pills they can forget to take.This really has the possibility of ending HIV transmission, said Greg Millett, public policy director at amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research.Condoms help guard against HIV infection if used properly but whats called PrEP  regularly using preventive medicines such as the daily pills or a different shot given every two months  is increasingly important.Lenacapavirs six-month protection makes it the longest-lasting type, an option that could attract people wary of more frequent doctor visits or stigma from daily pills.But upheaval in U.S. healthcare  including cuts to public health agencies and Medicaid  and slashing of American foreign aid to fight HIV are clouding the prospects.Millett said gaping holes in the system in the U.S. and globally are going to make it difficult for us to make sure we not only get lenacapavir into peoples bodies but make sure they come back twice a year to keep up their protection.Gileads drug already is sold to treat HIV under the brand name Sunlenca. The prevention dose will be sold under a different name, Yeztugo. Its given as two injections under the skin of the abdomen, leaving a small depot of medication to slowly absorb into the body. People must test negative for HIV before getting their twice-a-year dose, Gilead warned. It only prevents HIV transmission  it doesnt block other sexually transmitted diseases. Some researchers who helped test the shot advise cold packs to counter injection-site pain.Global efforts at ending the HIV pandemic by 2030 have stalled. There still are more than 30,000 new infections in the U.S. each year and about 1.3 million worldwide.Only about 400,000 Americans already use some form of PrEP, a fraction of those estimated to benefit. A recent study found states with high use of PrEP saw a decrease in HIV infections, while rates continued rising elsewhere.About half of new infections are in women, who often need protection they can use without a partners knowledge or consent. One rigorous study in South Africa and Uganda compared more than 5,300 sexually active young women and teen girls given twice-yearly lenacapavir or the daily pills. There were no HIV infections in those receiving the shot while about 2% in the comparison group caught HIV from infected sex partners.A second study found the twice-yearly shot nearly as effective in gay men and gender-nonconforming people in the U.S. and in several other countries hard-hit by HIV.Ian Haddock of Houston had tried PrEP off and on since 2015 but he jumped at the chance to participate in the lenacapavir study and continues with the twice-yearly shots as part of the research follow-up.Now I forget that Im on PrEP because I dont have to carry around a pill bottle, said Haddock, who leads the Normal Anomaly Initiative, a nonprofit serving Black LGBTQ+ communities.Men, women, gay, straight  it really just kinds of expands the opportunity for prevention, he added.Just remembering a clinic visit every six months is a powerful tool versus constantly having to talk about, like, condoms, constantly making sure youre taking your pill every day.Gilead said the U.S. list price, meaning before insurance, is $28,218 a year, which it called similar to some other PrEP options. The company said it anticipated insurance coverage but also has some financial assistance programs.Most private insurers are supposed to cover PrEP options without a co-pay although the Supreme Court is considering a case that could overturn that requirement. Congress also is considering huge cuts to Medicaid.And while community health centers still are an option, the Trump administration has largely dismantled HIV prevention work at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that would normally get the message to vulnerable populations whod qualify for the shot, said Carl Schmid of the nonprofit HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute.Schmid worries the shot wont meet its potential because were basically pulling the rug out of HIV prevention and testing and outreach programs.Gilead also has applications pending for the twice-yearly shot in other countries. Last fall, the company signed agreements with six generic drug makers to produce low-cost versions of the shot for 120 poor countries mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. Gilead plans to make enough shots to supply 2 million people in those countries, at no profit, until the generics are available, said company senior vice president Dr. Jared Baeten.Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS, said in a statement the price is still too high. If its unaffordable, she said, it will change nothing.And HIV experts worry the arrangements Gilead has made to reduce costs in some countries leave out middle-income countries like some in Latin America.Everyone in every country whos at risk of HIV needs access to PrEP, said Dr. Gordon Crofoot of Houston, who helped lead the study in men. We need to get easier access to PrEP thats highly effective like this is.\n\nWhile a vaccine to prevent HIV still is needed, some experts say the shot made by Gilead Sciences  a drug called lenacapavir  could be the next best thing.

There still are more than 30,000 new infections in the U.S. each year and about 1.3 million worldwide.Only about 400,000 Americans already use some form of PrEP, a fraction of those estimated to benefit. A recent study found states with high use of PrEP saw a decrease in HIV infections, while rates continued rising elsewhere.About half of new infections are in women, who often need protection they can use without a partners knowledge or consent. One rigorous study in South Africa and Uganda compared more than 5,300 sexually active young women and teen girls given twice-yearly lenacapavir or the daily pills. There were no HIV infections in those receiving the shot while about 2% in the comparison group caught HIV from infected sex partners.A second study found the twice-yearly shot nearly as effective in gay men and gender-nonconforming people in the U.S. and in several other countries hard-hit by HIV.Ian Haddock of Houston had tried PrEP off and on since 2015 but he jumped at the chance to participate in the lenacapavir study and continues with the twice-yearly shots as part of the research follow-up.Now I forget that Im on PrEP because I dont have to carry around a pill bottle, said Haddock, who leads the Normal Anomaly Initiative, a nonprofit serving Black LGBTQ+ communities.Men, women, gay, straight  it really just kinds of expands the opportunity for prevention, he added.Just remembering a clinic visit every six months is a powerful tool versus constantly having to talk about, like, condoms, constantly making sure youre taking your pill every day.Gilead said the U.S. list price, meaning before insurance, is $28,218 a year, which it called similar to some other PrEP options. The company said it anticipated insurance coverage but also has some financial assistance programs.Most private insurers are supposed to cover PrEP options without a co-pay although the Supreme Court is considering a case that could overturn that requirement. Congress also is considering huge cuts to Medicaid.And while community health centers still are an option, the Trump administration has largely dismantled HIV prevention work at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that would normally get the message to vulnerable populations whod qualify for the shot, said Carl Schmid of the nonprofit HIV+Hepatitis Policy Institute.Schmid worries the shot wont meet its potential because were basically pulling the rug out of HIV prevention and testing and outreach programs.Gilead also has applications pending for the twice-yearly shot in other countries. Last fall, the company signed agreements with six generic drug makers to produce low-cost versions of the shot for 120 poor countries mostly in Africa, Southeast Asia and the Caribbean. Gilead plans to make enough shots to supply 2 million people in those countries, at no profit, until the generics are available, said company senior vice president Dr. Jared Baeten.Winnie Byanyima, executive director of UNAIDS, said in a statement the price is still too high. If its unaffordable, she said, it will change nothing.And HIV experts worry the arrangements Gilead has made to reduce costs in some countries leave out middle-income countries like some in Latin America.Everyone in every country whos at risk of HIV needs access to PrEP, said Dr. Gordon Crofoot of Houston, who helped lead the study in men. We need to get easier access to PrEP thats highly effective like this is.\n\nBut upheaval in U.S. healthcare  including cuts to public health agencies and Medicaid  and slashing of American foreign aid to fight HIV are clouding the prospects.\n\nMillett said gaping holes in the system in the U.S. and globally are going to make it difficult for us to make sure we not only get lenacapavir into peoples bodies but make sure they come back twice a year to keep up their protection.Gileads drug already is sold to treat HIV under the brand name Sunlenca. The prevention dose will be sold under a different name, Yeztugo. Its given as two injections under the skin of the abdomen, leaving a small depot of medication to slowly absorb into the body.

            "content": "By newZWire\n\nA US$126 million plan to build a new dam for Bulawayo could finally ease the citys long-running water crisis, but the private financing model may leave residents paying up to three times more for water.\n\nThe proposed Glass Block Dam, to be built in the Umzingwane catchment area, is being promoted by a private consortium led by JR Goddard, project managers Sesani, and financial advisors Genesis Global Finance under a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model.Under the proposed deal, Bulawayo and the consortium would enter a 25-year water purchase agreement with ZINWA.The city would own the dam wall, but the dam itself would belong to ZINWA under the Water Act, according to a new report which has just been tabled in Parliament by a joint committee of MPs.Funding is expected to come from the African Development Bank (AfDB) and Afreximbank. To recoup the investment, according to the report, water from Glass Block will cost Bulawayo City Council up to US$0.90 per mega litre, nearly triple the current US$0.33 per mega litre charged by ZINWA.The astronomical charge of water proposed by the Glass Block consortium of US$0.99 cents per mega litre will have a catastrophic impact on the water billing system of Bulawayo, causing severe overcharges on the end users, the MPs say.In Zimbabwe, where the state has failed to directly fund large-scale infrastructure, BOT is a pragmatic option. But theres a trade-off; cost recovery. Although the dams developers are reportedly exploring ways to cut the proposed charge to US$0.50, MPs warn that even this is still too high for the average resident.It is imperative that the arrangement of the water service charge be significantly revised before making any headway towards giving the project the green light. Water is a basic human right and should not be commercialised in any way whatsoever to the detriment of its access by the citizenry, the report says.BOT alternativeThe Gwayi-Shangani project was the big hope for Bulawayo. But governments payment delays have slowed progress. The project needs another US$84 million to complete the dam wall and US$684 million more to lay a 252km pipeline. So, the city is looking at the smaller Glass Block as a faster alternative.The Glass Block Dam is presumed to ease pressure from the government coffers and give the government breathing space to focus on the demanding Gwayi-Shangani Project, the report says.But the report also reveals the risks of BOT. Because developers have to recover their investments within a limited operating window, tariffs must be set high enough to guarantee returns, even for basics like water.The Glass Block Dam consortium had initially sought funding from the US governments International Development Finance Corporation (DFC). But DFC turned them down, saying it does not fund projects in Zimbabwe. This pushed the consortium to approach AfDB and Afreximbank. That they appear to have secured alternative financing is a win for the consortium. But the burden now shifts to ratepayers already facing high service charges and erratic supply.Bulawayo: Between drought and debtBulawayos water crisis is urgent. Three of its key damsUmzingwane, Upper Ncema and Lower Ncemaare dry.Aquifers and smaller dams offer only limited relief. Gwayi-Shangani, which was meant to be the long-term fix, is years behind schedule. Once completed, Gwayi-Shangani would supply 220 megalitres of water daily, above Bulawayos current daily demand of 165 megalitres.But without funding to complete the wall, pipeline, and associated infrastructure, including the 10MW hydropower plant, the city remains dry.
