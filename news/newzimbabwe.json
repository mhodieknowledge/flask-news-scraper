This includes the Minister of Police and the Minister of Home Affairs, to say that they too must make sure that they are not complacent in these acts of Operation Dudula.\n\nSithole said, the state cannot simply enter peoples homes and start doing raids. They need to have a search warrant, they need to have arrest warrants. In public, they need to have a clear, reasonable suspicion that someone is an undocumented foreign national before they can ask for such identity documents.\n\nOperation Dudula members outside the court said they would not be changing their stance and would do what needs to be done on the streets.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nProphetic Healing and Deliverance (PHD) Ministries founder Walter Magayas wife, Tendai, has been granted US$500 bail by Harare magistrate Marewanazvo Gofa in a case she is accused of fraud.\n\nThe magistrate ruled that the State had failed to present compelling reasons to justify keeping her in custody.\n\nShe is jointly charged with her husband, Walter Magaya, and their company Planet Africa, represented by Tendai Chinguwa. The trio is accused of defrauding members of the public and congregants of PHD Ministries through a bogus housing and investment scheme.\n\nAccording to the State, the alleged scam saw the ministry and its associated companies receiving over US$50,000, R195,000, and ZW$1,000 from victims, none of which has been recovered.\n\nIn her ruling, Magistrate Gofa said that although Tendai Magaya faces a serious charge, this alone could not justify denying her bail.\n\nIn casu, the court finds that the submissions by the accused are plausible, Gofa said. The accused person is not a flight risk. If the State started investigating her in 2023, it shows she has been aware and could have fled to the UK, South Africa, or any other country, but she did not. Denying her bail given this would be tantamount to a travesty of justice; it defies common sense.\n\nThe magistrate added that any fears raised by the State could be adequately addressed through bail conditions.\n\nGofa described her as a good candidate for bail, noting that she has a fixed address and has not shown any intention to abscond. She was ordered to deposit US$500, surrender her passport, report once every two weeks at Waterfalls Police Station, reside at her current address, and not interfere with witnesses.\n\nShe was remanded to November 18, the same date as her husband, Walter Magaya.\n\nProsecutors allege that sometime in 2016, the accused misrepresented that they had acquired land in several areas across the country, including Chishawasha, Norton, Westgate, Mutare, Bulawayo, Kwekwe, Arcturus, Ruwa, Manyame, and Nyatsime, for housing, farming, bee-keeping, and mining projects meant to benefit church members and the public.\n\nDuring a church service that was also broadcast live on Yadah Television, it is alleged that they announced that God had instructed them to help members acquire residential stands and houses, claiming the projects would be managed through Planet Africa and Yadah Connect.\n\nPamphlets featuring Bible verses and images of the purported land and houses were distributed to lure followers.\n\nThe State further alleges that congregants were invited to buy stands and invest in various ventures, including mining and farming projects, with promises of a 50% return after six months. Many members reportedly paid thousands of dollars to the companies and signed memoranda of understanding falsely indicating that the firms had been allocated land by the Ministry of Local Government.\n\nIn 2017, after complaints began surfacing, the accused allegedly sought to restore confidence by entering into a one-season farming contract with former Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe governor Dr Gideon Gono at New Donnington Farm in Norton. They reportedly took congregants to the property, falsely claiming ownership and that it was ready for stand allocations, even though the farm belonged to Dr Gono and was not for sale.\n\n",

Accordingly, all accused have appeared before the courts they have remedies before other courts as alluded to by the state. Accordingly, application for immediate release of the accused due to overdetention is hereby dismissed, she ruled.\n\nThe magistrate said the trio could seek redress in the Constitutional Court, adding that the court was guided by the 2015 Mloyi and Madondo case.\n\nIn practice courts are guided by most recent case laws, she said, siding with the States position that the accuseds remedy lay elsewhere.\n\nGofa further ruled that no bail application would be entertained in relation to the rape case Magaya is facing. He was remanded in custody to November 13.\n\nHis lawyer, Admire Rubaya, said they would not seek bail for the separate fraud case at the magistrates court but would approach the High Court instead.\n\nMeanwhile, the defence team is now pursuing a bail application for Magayas wife, Tendai.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFormer Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) leader Nelson Chamisa has criticised the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the African Union (AU), accusing them of failing to act decisively in response to Tanzanias deepening political crisis.\n\nHe urged both bodies to move beyond passive observation and take meaningful steps to facilitate a political resolution, following a controversial election in which hundreds of opposition supporters and activists have reportedly been killed.\n\nAccording to reports, approximately 700 people were killed after protesting last weeks presidential election. The poll saw the incumbent, President Samia Suluhu Hassan, run virtually unchallenged after key opposition figures were jailed or barred from participating.\n\nIn a statement issued on Monday, Chamisa argued that it is inadequate for SADC simply to note irregularities in an election without providing mechanisms to address them.\n\nWhile acknowledging the objective and constructive SEOM report, and the notable observations and deficits highlighted by the SADC Electoral Observation Mission (SEOM), it remains imperative to further strengthen institutions, mechanisms, and laws that serve as avenues of appeal to address and enhance electoral processes, and to ensure the execution and implementation of the recommendations designed to resolve electoral issues.\n\nThere must be a framework and roadmap for resolving disputes in all the countries with such challenges, in particular Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Tanzania. This will curb the recurring problems and the vicious cycle of disputed and discredited electoral processes, he said.\n\nChamisa went further, accusing the AU of routinely endorsing flawed elections that entrench authoritarian leaders.\n\nWe further call upon the AU to stop, and forthwith seize, the tradition of rubber stamping, and to cease endorsing tyranny and the reversal of democracy on the continent. A New Africa in Our Lifetime. We Will Make It Possible, he said.\n\nHe argued that instead of defending democracy, the AU has increasingly acted as a passive spectator.\n\nEqually, the African Union has been found wanting by ignoring these ongoing challenges. The AU has been an absent guardian and a missing guardrail. Instead of fulfilling its mandate with and for the African people, it has become a club for the endorsement of illegitimacy, oppression and African peoples marginalisation.\n\nChamisa also expressed solidarity with Tanzanian opposition figures who have been detained. He called for the immediate release of political prisoners and urged SADC to reform itself to better manage modern political crises.\n\nIn Tanzania, we urge the immediate release of the opposition leader, Tundu Lissu, and all other political prisoners, and stress the need for a political solution to address the problems affecting the citizens of Tanzania. SADC needs to be revamped and reformed to capacitate it to deal with contemporary challenges emerging in the region, he said.\n\nChamisa briefly reflected on his personal experience with disputed elections in 2018 and 2023, taking a subtle jab at President Emmerson Mnangagwa, whom he implied had benefited from questionable electoral processes.\n\nCCC senior leader Senator Jameson Timba also urged Tanzanian opposition leaders to sustain lawful pressure.\n\nThe opposition and civil society in Tanzania must maintain lawful, disciplined pressure until full accountability and reform are achieved. If they lift their foot from the pedal now, they will have only themselves to blame when repression hardens, Timba said.\n\nMeanwhile, President Samia Suluhu Hassan was sworn in yesterday. Notably, very few regional leaders attended the ceremony. Zimbabwe was represented by Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, while many other countries sent lower-level delegations.\n\nTanzanias election has drawn widespread condemnation from international human rights organisations.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) has urged businesses to adapt to the emerging reality of sustained inflation decline and adjust their prices in line with the current deflationary trends.\n\nZimbabwes annual inflation, measured in the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency, fell sharply to 32.7% in October from 82.7% in September 2025, with analysts projecting a further drop to between 15% and 20% by December 2025.\n\nQuoting Ben Bernanke, former Chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, CZI noted that deflationary patterns are not artificially induced but stem from underlying economic realities.\n\nThe sources of deflation are not a mystery. Deflation is in almost all cases a side effect of a collapse of aggregate demand a drop in spending so severe that producers must cut prices on an ongoing basis in order to find buyers, the industry lobby group said in its report.\n\nCZI highlighted that ZiG month-on-month inflation has been on a downward trajectory for three consecutive months, dropping to -0.4% in October 2025 from -0.2% in September 2025, the lowest inflation rate recorded so far this year.\n\nHowever, the organisation cautioned that local traders may remain hesitant to reduce prices due to historical fears of economic volatility. It warned that price stickiness, the resistance of market prices to decrease despite changes in the broader economy, could negatively impact market efficiency if left unchecked.\n\nDeflation, the CZI explained, means that goods and services are becoming cheaper in ZiG terms, which benefits consumers in the short term by increasing their purchasing power.\n\nIt also means that consumers who kept ZiG balances in their bank accounts are now able to purchase slightly more goods than what they could have bought in August 2025. If this momentum is maintained, it could significantly enhance confidence in the ZiG, said the CZI.\n\nThe industry body added that the steep fall in inflation largely reflects the fading effects of the September 2024 devaluation, which had sharply driven up the Consumer Price Index (CPI). With month-on-month inflation now well contained, CZI expects further easing in the coming months.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nDuring a recent guest appearance on the SMWX podcast,Tony Forbes, father of the late award-winning rapper Kiernan AKA Forbes,revealed that he has forgiven the men accused of killing his son.\n\nAKA and his friend Tebello Tibz Motsoanewere shot dead outside the Wish restaurant on Florida Road, Durban, in February 2023. Seven men have been charged with the murders. The men face trial in June 2026.\n\nI have forgiven those people. I had not forgiven them before I knew who they were, but now that I know, I have forgiven them, but Id like to see justice. I need to see justice.\n\nI have not walked around in the last 2 to 3 years thinking about the case or being angry, because if I did, thats all I would have done, and it would have just consumed me, shared Forbes.\n\nHe continued: I feel we are on the right path. I feel like the police and prosecution have done a tremendous job. I have huge respect for them  I feel positive about the future, that we tackle crime in this country in such a way that what happened to my son, doesnt happen to other peoples children \n\nOther parents have lost multiple children; I am not unique in that sense.\n\nDuring the conversation with host Sizwe Mpofu-Walsh, Forbes recalled his bond with his son, AKA, earlier radio appearances, as well as the fateful night he found out that AKA had been shot.\n\nI went to sleep about 9pm, and I woke up after 12. Someone was calling my name through the gate. I dont think the bell was working  I went out and it turned out to be my Godchild, Kiernans cousin, Talia and her boyfriend.\n\nTalia held out the phone and said, My dad wants to tell you something  He just said, Tony, Ive got bad news, Kiernans been shot.\n\nI remember I had a brief moment where I wanted to ask, Is he okay, is he alive?, but Trevor just said that it was fatal. It didnt register for me. I just sat down on the steps right by the gate. I was confused. I didnt break down emotionally.\n\nFive minutes later, I was on the phone with Steffan (AKAs brother), and then he put his mother (Lynn Forbes) on. I think it was like a good few minutes where we didnt say a word. There were no words to utter, there was nothing, said Forbes.\n\nForbes shared how he felt a rush of air while he was showering in the early hours of the morning after receiving the devastating news.\n\nAt around 3am, I went to take a shower. It was a windstill evening, the window was open, and I just got into the shower and I felt this rush of air. I instinctively felt it was Kiernan, who was saying, Dad, Im on the other side, but Im with you, and to this day, I feel that that was him.\n\nIm not ashamed to say that I went to see a medium, and she said to me that its not unusual when family members die in that way, as they leave this life, from the shock, its like they are screaming, and it goes to the people who are biologically linked to them.\n\nTravelling to Durban the next day, Forbes faced the heart-wrenching task of identifying his son. He had never experienced the loss of a loved one before and described his nervousness, but also found solace in the support they had received.\n\nThose two hours on the plane were just two of the most lonely hours I spent. I had never been to identify anyone in a mortuary, never, and suddenly here I am  I never dealt with death, but I was able to \n\nI remember seeing him the first time. I was very nervous, but he looked like he was sleeping, and still, I was looking for movement. We saw him again after they worked on him; he looked peaceful.\n\nWhat was amazing was how people came around us and supported us. The undertakers paid for everything; we didnt pay a cent. The people at the house, his friends, bought food, drinks, and flowers. As much as it was a very sad time, it just showed how much Kiernan was loved.\n\nAs he described the painful experience of selecting a coffin, he shared: The first time it really hit me was when we had to go select the coffin, and when I saw the coffins, that was the moment. It drove it home to me that this was it.\n\nReflecting on the inquest regarding Anele Tembes death, Forbes commented: When I think of the inquest and Anele and Kiernan, I dont think of us versus them. Anele was good to me when she was alive, just as Kiernans other partners were to me.\n\nHer dad, Moses, will tell you, I used to call him, especially on a Sunday, to see how they were doing. I sometimes look at pictures of those two children and I think, What a waste, they not here with us anymore.\n\nAs the inquest should come out, it should be at a place where its not a competition, it is not about us versus them or Kiernan versus Anele. We need some closure, but we also need to do it in a fair and balanced way.\n\nSpeaking about the remarks that formerPolice Minister Bheki Celemade surrounding Anele Tembes death, at Parliaments Ad Hoc Committee last week,Forbessaid:His words still carry a lot of weight and there are people out there, and I can see the comments on social media that are now saying, Yeah, we always suspected something and that now confirms it. I feel like his comments has reopened the wounds and its regrettable \n\nAt this moment, I think the NPA should be responding to what the ex Minister had said and set the record straight. My disappointment is that the advocate and her team are quiet. They are saying nothing, and I think that is unfair.\n\nOur job, as a family, is to protect his (AKAs) legacy, to live his legacy, to enhance his legacy and for us, these statements being made, and basically the nations being told that we thought he murdered her, is harming his legacy. I want the nation to be told the facts.\n\n",

In Gaza alone, my Office has documented the killing of 252 journalists since 7 October 2023. And in nearly nine out of ten cases, those who kill journalists around the world have not been brought to justice. This culture of impunity fuels further attacks and undermines freedom of expression, civic space, and ultimately, peace, Trk said.\n\nThe UN High Commissioner made the remarks in a video message to mark the International Day to End Impunity for Crimes against Journalists, which is commemorated annually on November 2.\n\nHe said journalists who expose injustice and give voice to the voiceless are human rights defenders, yet, across the globe, governments, corporations and criminals threaten, harass and detain them as well as subjecting them to arbitrary detention, to transnational repression, and even murder.\n\nThe UN official said the emergence of new journalisms have been weaponised to amplify abuse, distort reality, and intensify harm including deepfake sexual images, AI-generated defamatory content, and the amplification of misogynistic hate speech through algorithmic tools and bots.\n\nWomen journalists are targeted not only for their reporting, but also because of their gender. They face harassment, sexual violence, and coordinated online attacks designed to silence their voices and strengthen patriarchal norms. Nearly three in four women journalists report that they have been subjected to online violence. This may lead them to self-censor, to leave their jobs, or to live in fear, said Trk.\n\nThe UN official said his office is working to address these challenges by monitoring, documenting and reporting violations against journalists, including online, and advocating with States and technology companies guided by the dimensions of GBV online.\n\nStates have a legal obligation to prevent, investigate, and punish all attacks against journalists  including those that take place online. Technology companies also have responsibilities to respect human rights and to pursue accountability for people who use their platforms and products to perpetrate abuses.\n\nTo end impunity for crimes against journalists, we need stronger, more determined political will, better legal frameworks, and accountability mechanisms that respond to todays digital world, added Trk.\n\n",
