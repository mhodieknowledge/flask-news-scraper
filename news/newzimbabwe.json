Kwekweza has risked a lot for this: she has been arrested several times and has reported torture and intimidation attempts. Every achievement has its price, says Kwekweza.At the end of the day, we have to choose our hard, Kwekweza told DW.If youre abducted for speaking truth to power, if youre in prison for speaking truth to power, its hard, but if youre waking up and youre living a life, a shell of a life that is limited in opportunity and possibility, that is also hard.Representative of a new generationReceiving the German Africa Prize came as a surprise, the young activist admitted. She went on to work her way through the awards history.And when I did have the opportunity to go through past recipients of the award, since it started in the 90s, I am in awe that I do fall on that list of individuals, said Kwekweza.This was also thanks to her community and the team at WELEAD Africa, Kwekweza pointed out.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA FRESH wave of abductions and torture is unravelling in Zimbabwe amid a pushback against President Emmerson Mnangagwas regimes attempt to extend his incumbency beyond 2028.\n\nKnown and perceived critics of Mnangagwas plot are now targeted for abduction, torture and possible disappearances. Those lucky to face the law will be charged with violating the controversial Patriotic Act, a Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) intelligence officer told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nRecently, activist Godfrey Karembera, popularly known as Madzibaba Veshanduko, was reportedly seized by unidentified men, later found in State custody, and allegedly beaten and denied medical care, according to rights groups and independent media.\n\nPolice claim he faces charges under Zimbabwes Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act and are signalling possible use of the Patriotic Act (2023)  a controversial amendment that criminalises conduct deemed to injure the sovereignty and national interest of Zimbabwe.\n\nKaremberas detention betrays a broader climate in which dissent is met with State-linked violence, opaque charges, and expansive security laws, a senior police intelligence officer told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nOnly last week, two student activists from Chinhoyi University of Technology (CUT) were abducted and tortured. Lindon Zanga (21) and Malvin Madanda (29), who belong to a students union aligned to the opposition, were on November 10 abducted, tortured and dumped by unknown assailants over impending students council elections.\n\nThe recent cases of abductions and torture have reignited concern over a rising pattern targeting government critics.\n\nThese cases fit a long-standing pattern of targeted abductions and intimidation of opposition figures, students, and activists, said Lemuel Mukandawire, a human rights defender.\n\nAs rights organisations, we argue that the Patriotic Acts wording is vague and enables abuse and suppresses legitimate political organising.\n\nThough parts of the 2023 law have been challenged in court, key provisions remain in force and continue to be invoked.\n\nThe legislation, Mukandawire said, is also meant to silence activism beyond Zimbabwes borders.\n\nAuthorities from the Mnangagwa establishment are reportedly closely watching organisers ofdemonstrations inother countries against the 83-year-old Zanu PF leader, whose administration is blamed economic decay that is resulting in droves leaving the country for greener pastures.\n\nThere is a long watchlist of with names of diaspora activists such as Tanyaradzwa Emily Daka, Francis Mubani, Xoliso Sithole, Mollin Muteto, Cretah Mupfudze, Dadirayi Mukwedeya, Ralph Dube, Elizabeth Chitengo, Happiness Ncube, Edgar Mancini, Eness Mapungwana, Nkululeko Ndlovu, Melody Talent Mkwenje, Prince Justin Chihurani, Josephine Mudimbu and others, who are of interest.\n\nZimbabweans in the UK are watching closely, as authorities have hinted that the same law may be applied to those accused of coordinating political activity abroad. The police source cited meetings that took place before and after the failed demonstration in Zimbabwe, further said the police source.\n\nMeetings held in South Africa, UK in Durham led by Shepherd Yuda and Patson Muzuwa, among others, have reportedly rattled President Emmerson Mnangagwas regime accused of running down the economy and gross human rights violations.\n\nRights groups continue to call for independent investigation, medical access, and protection of fundamental freedoms as fears grow that transnational repression may widen.\n\n",

I had really closed the Zimbabwean chapter between Aliko Dangote and my country Zimbabwe. I was doing other things things for other countries for Aliko, said Mahachi.\n\nA cousin contacted me that we need to start this chapter again. I almost blocked him because of the stress that I went through in 2015. Fast forward, here we are. It was one word to Aliko and say let us try again, said Mahachi.\n\nDangote arrived in Zimbabwe last week to sign a potential US$1 billion investment deal that he committed to the country.\n\nHowever, for Mahachi, it was not a stroll in the park to convince Dangote to lend an ear to Zimbabwe for the second time.\n\nHonestly I do not want to lie. I had really closed the Zimbabwean chapter between Aliko Dangote and my country Zimbabwe. I was doing other things things for other countries for Aliko, said Mahachi.\n\nMahachi joined forces with Sikhosana and visited the Dangote Groups plant in Nigeria, which culminated in the billionaires visit to Zimbabwe last week.\n\nDangote pledged to invest several millions in Zimbabwe, targeting cement manufacturing, coal mining, power generation, and fuel pipelines from Walvis Bay, Namibia.\n\nDuring his visit, Dangote acknowledged that the economic environment had changed under the leadership of President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nSikhosana said the visit by the Dangote Industries leadership is a turning point for Zimbabwe.\n\nThe historic visit between the government of Zimbabwe and Dangote Industries, an engagement where we were honoured to advise and play a midwife. This moment not of transaction. It is a turning point. It is a declaration that Zimbabwe. A sign that the global capital is begining to listen.\n\nWe startd this journey in June 2024, no leak no whisper, no breach, said Sikhosana.\n\nAfter the signing of the multi-million-dollar deal, Dangote has already set the wheels in motion, with his team arriving in Zimbabwe this Sunday.\n\n",

The conditions have necessitated a tight monetary policy stance and a commitment to maintain the grip on money supply.Presenting the groups performance for the half years period ended September 30 2025, Delta board chairman, Todd Moyo acknowledged the positive impact of stable exchange rates on product sales.The Group benefited from a relatively stable operating environment during the half-year period under review. Consumer spending remained strong, driven by a stable ZWG exchange rate, the record-breaking tobacco marketing season, increased mining activities and the firm mineral prices, particularly gold.Diaspora remittances are also benefiting from the firming of cross exchange rates such as the Rand and Pound, our key source markets, he said.During the period, group revenue for the half year at US$514 million increased by 32% compared to the prior year, reflecting volume growth across the Zimbabwe business units and the inclusion of Schweppes as a subsidiary.The revenue growth was weighed down by the price moderations in the Sparkling Beverages business, which partly absorbed the sugar tax to maintain volume and competitiveness. The proportion of domestic sales undertaken in foreign currency was 92% during the period under review.Moyo said the Zimbabwe Gold (ZWG), was relatively stable during the half year, reducing the level of rate estimation for compliance with IFRS and IAS 21. The rates used at the reporting date were within the ranges allowed by the monetary regulations.Profit After Tax (PAT) surged by nearly 83% to US$75,05 million for the six months ended September 30, 2025, largely driven by robust revenue growth of 32% and a sharp decline in exchange losses.Lager beer volumes rose 21%, supported by stronger consumer incomes and stable pricing.The sorghum beer category expanded 16%, buoyed by firm demand from mining communities and commercial agriculture, while sparkling beverages registered an 11% increase, reflecting modest recovery amid sugar tax pressures.Delta subsidiary, African Distillers Limited, delivered the strongest outturn, with overall volumes up 43%led by wine (59%), ready-to-drink beverages (47%) and spirits (36%).\n\nThe ZWG currency has sustained stability for most part of 2025, sustaining an exchange rate premium of US$1:ZWG27 since its last major depreciation in September 2024.
