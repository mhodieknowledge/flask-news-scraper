It is widely considered a critical juncture for Zimbabwes reform agenda.\n\nWhile the Staff Monitored Programme (SMP) does not provide funding, its successful implementation is a prerequisite for future access to concessional financing, potential debt restructuring, and the restoration of confidence among international creditors and investorsall of which Zimbabwe desperately needs.The southern African nation is burdened with a burgeoning public debt that has now exceeded US$21 billion, including more than US$12.3 billion owed to external creditors.Following the visit, IMF Mission Chief Maliszewski said the IMF would like to see a fully functioning local ZiG currency and fiscal discipline with a balance between expenditure and revenue.He also addressed the issue of corruption and stressed the need for a genuine currency exchange market, as well as a credible debt restructuring process.In an attempt to put a positive spin on this, Mangwana posted on his X account his own interpretation of the IMFs comments.The IMF sees macroeconomic stability in Zimbabwe we see it too. They want to see the ZIG becoming fully our national currency  we want that too. They see the ZIG stability we are witnesses.However, Mahere, who is also a constitutional lawyer, strongly disagreed with Mangwanas sentiments.Did you listen carefully to what the IMF representative is actually saying? These are the key takeaways: This Govt has no fiscal discipline. Fiscal discipline is urgently required. The public financial management system is worrisome. Read theres too much corruption.The people need reassurance that the so-called reforms introduced will stay. Read theres no trust or public confidence in what the Govt says about the state of the economy.The ZIG is not yet a national currency. While it may look stable, it is not widely used. The official exchange rate is artificial as demonstrated by the existence of a parallel market rate. The fact that the two dont converge is problematic. You can rig an election but you cannot rig the economy, Mahere wrote on her X account in response to Mangwana.Fourteen months after its introduction, the ZiG currency is still failing to facilitate payments for essential services such as passport issuance, fuel, and other necessities, indicating its shortcomings.The private sector, particularly Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), does not accept ZiG as a form of payment in its daily transactions, leaving many, especially civil servants, searching for US dollars on the parallel market, where the exchange rate is US$1: 40 ZiG, even though the Treasury has set the official exchange rate at US$1: 27 ZiG.\n\nWhile the Staff Monitored Programme (SMP) does not provide funding, its successful implementation is a prerequisite for future access to concessional financing, potential debt restructuring, and the restoration of confidence among international creditors and investorsall of which Zimbabwe desperately needs.\n\nThe southern African nation is burdened with a burgeoning public debt that has now exceeded US$21 billion, including more than US$12.3 billion owed to external creditors.\n\nFollowing the visit, IMF Mission Chief Maliszewski said the IMF would like to see a fully functioning local ZiG currency and fiscal discipline with a balance between expenditure and revenue.\n\nHe also addressed the issue of corruption and stressed the need for a genuine currency exchange market, as well as a credible debt restructuring process.\n\nIn an attempt to put a positive spin on this, Mangwana posted on his X account his own interpretation of the IMFs comments.\n\nThe IMF sees macroeconomic stability in Zimbabwe we see it too.

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/mps-call-for-pit-bull-terrier-ban-in-zimbabwe-say-dog-breed-has-become-dangerous-to-citizens/",
            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nDISTURBED by the deadly Pit Bull Terrier dogs vicious and fatal attack of a Harare resident recently, legislators want the breed banned in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Pit Bull Terrier, commonly known as Pitbull, is an aggressive type of canine.\n\nMembers of Parliament (MPs) suggested to the Speaker Jacob Mudenda during a Question and Answer session this Wednesday that the dog breed known as Pitbull had become a threat to peoples lives as it is not wired to obey instructions like some of the breeds, hence, it should be banned in the country.\n\nThe call comes barely a fortnight after a man was mauled to death by the terrifying dogs in Bluff Hill, Harare.\n\nZanu PF Goromonzi West MP Biata Beatrice Karimatsenga- Nyamupinga raised concern over the pets-turned-killers.\n\nWhen moving in the bush we fear being killed by wild animals but when we are moving in the residential areas there are dogs such as the Pitbull.\n\nThe Pitbull is killing people. That dog does not listen to instructions from the owner. What is the government policy on the keeping of animals, in particular dogs like the Pitbull?\n\nResponding to the question, Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi, who is also Leader of Government Business in Parliament, said the law, through councils, clearly stated that a dog owner should have a licence.\n\nThat law clearly states the number of dogs which are allowed in each and every household in towns. In other areas there are no dogs which are allowed.\n\nThat is why the individual who kept a Pitbull which killed someone was arrested. The police apprehended him because it was against the law. The Pitbull needs a licence which is different from other types of dogs because it is a very vicious dog, Ziyambi said.\n\nIn her supplementary question, Karimatsenga-Nyamupinga, however, disputed that the licence itself was not enough to stop such deadly attacks seen in the past week.\n\nShe highlighted that the Pitbull loses its memory, hence needs to be outlawed.\n\nYes, the licence can be there but we have that type of dog which loses its memory. What are we trying to say if we are allowing people to keep dogs which lose their memory? What are we trying to say about the lives of people? the MP stated.\n\nZiyambi told Mudenda that her question could only be responded to by the Veterinary Department, adding she should put the question in writing for further investigation from experts.\n\nThe government policy clearly indicates that for someone to keep dogs, they must be given a licence. If we want to go deeper on the types of licence and groups, it really needs to be written down so that we can go and consult the experts.\n\nIt will be easier for each and every individual in this august House and the rest of the country to understand the requirements needed to keep Pitbull dogs, Ziyambi explained.\n\nMudenda ordered the MP to put her question in writing, as it needed further clarification.\n\nChinhoyi MP Leslie Mhangwa added his weight to the conversation.\n\nlf we have somebody who has become a danger to the community, he is put in jail or put somewhere else.\n\nThe Pitbull as a breed has become a danger to the people of Zimbabwe. Is there anything that stops us from banning the breed within the country? I think this is the direction we need to move with.\n\nThe Speaker made a ruling that the question by Karimatsenga-Nyamupinga be put in writing and be dealt with next week.\n\nA Harare man, Samuel Machara was recently killed by Pitbulls owned by Mike Mupinga (40) of Bluff Hill in Harare, who was arrested and charged with culpable homicide.\n\nIn 2022, a Bulawayo man from Selborne suburb was also bitten to death by his own canines.\n\nTwelve countries in Europe, as well as Australia, Canada, some parts of the United States, Ecuador, Malaysia, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, and Venezuela, have enacted some form of breed-specific legislation on Pitbull-type dogs, including American Pit Bull Terriers, ranging from outright bans to restrictions and conditions on ownership.\n\nSeveral states in Australia place restrictions on the breed, including mandatory sterilisation. Pitbulls are banned in the United Kingdom, in the Canadian province of Ontario, and in many locations in the United States.\n\n",

You could not disrespect the office of the president, Trump said in an interview with NBC on Sunday.Musk appeared to have deleted many of his posts over the weekend, including one calling for Trumps impeachment.Musk was the largest donor for Trumps 2024 presidential campaign and had been considered the presidents right-hand man.Former Trump aide Steve Bannon called for Musk, who was born in South Africa, to be deported.US Vice-President JD Vance told reporters on Wednesday that while Trump was frustrated with Musk, the president does not want a long-term feud with the Tesla CEO.Vance also said he had spoken to both Trump and Musk about the billionaire donor remaining supportive of the administration.Most Republicans have called for the two men to reconcile, while Democrats have watched on as the feud unfolded.Their fallout came shortly after Musk left the task force he headed called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), which he had promised would make trillions of dollars of federal spending cuts, 129 days into the job.So far, those cuts appear to have been smaller. After his departure, many of the Doge staff he hired have stayed on at a variety of federal agencies.\n\nIn response, Trump said Musk had lost his mind and threatened to cancel his government contracts, which have an estimated value of $38bn (28bn).

The newly recruited adjunct lecturers drawn from the streets are also not attending lectures. Dissertations are not being supervised, and exams are not being written.\n\nThere were demonstrations from the lecturers, yet other students are to go for work-related learning. It seems this semester is a sheer waste of time to students as well as a loss of parents hard-earned money, Moyo said.\n\nFurther, the MP expressed concern over the chaos at the learning institution.\n\nThere is chaos and uncertainty at our institution. If it pleases you, Hon. Speaker Sir, I request the Hon. Minister of Higher Education, Innovation, Science and Technology Development, to come and give us a ministerial statement on the negotiations, deadlocks, or practical police intervention to bring normalcy to our tertiary institution, Moyo added.\n\nThe Speaker responded, We will advise the Hon. Minister if he can make a Ministerial Statement on the situation.\n\nUZ lecturers are demanding a return to their pre-2018 salaries, where a junior lecturer earned US$2,250 per month. Currently, they earn approximately US$230.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Artisanal Miners Association (ZAMA) has tabled a formalisation program targeting all the artisanal players as part of efforts to maximise profits while easing the burden of work-related injuries and fatalities.\n\nArtisanal mining in Zimbabwe is largely blamed for accelerated environmental degradation and violation of socio-cultural systems. A 2022 Centre for Natural Resource Governance report on illicit financial flows in the artisanal mining sector estimated that as much as $1.9 billion is lost annually due to leakages.\n\nOn their part, artisanal miners have since cried foul over ill treatment, stigma and underpayments for the minerals by gold buyers in the shadowy economy.\n\nSpeaking to NewZimbabwe.com on Wednesday, ZAMA national coordinator, Elias Masuku, said the formalisation program will solve all the problems around artisanal mining once and for all.\n\nWe are currently rolling out a formalisation exercise which is driven by the motive of regularising every mining workspace across Zimbabwe. We are also pushing for the availability of workspaces through negotiations with people who have idle claims for them to cede. Such initiatives will go a long way to create opportunities for those willing to venture into mining, he said.\n\nMasuku said the association is offering legal services to support small-scale miners who often face the risk of harassment from the sectors big players who enjoy a firmer financial muscle. This, he said, is over and above other benefits like housing schemes, which will soon be tabled.\n\nWe have since begun work in places like Mberengwa. We are going to have a project in Buluwewe and other places as we drive the agenda of formalising, capitalising and capacitating the artisanal miner. Formalisation will benefit the miners and all the stakeholders in the value chain and is now long overdue, added Masuku.\n\n",

He had a long-term relationship with a South African woman. His niece, Pauline Mhlolo, told GroundUp that the relationship was destined for marriage.\n\nMhlolo described him as a quiet and gentle young man. Despite not being anywhere near the tavern where September was killed, he was bludgeoned with a sharp object and sustained fatal injuries to his head. His home was raided and most of his belongings were stolen.\n\nI saw him lying helplessly in his bed at Livingstone Hospital. He was not responding to our voices, said Mhlolo.\n\nDuring the attacks, dozens of immigrant men were beaten and taken to hospital. Hundreds of women and children were forced to flee their homes.\n\nThe displaced families sought shelter at Addo Police Station and at achurch hall in Gqeberha. On 1 June, these shelters were inspected by immigration officers from the Department of Home Affairs. Hundreds werearrestedand 127 people opted for voluntary deportation.\n\nJaune September was laid to rest on Saturday. GroundUp attended the funeral. It was peaceful and well attended. Ward councillor Xolani Jonas urged the immigrant community to return to their homes.\n\nChris Mapingure, chairman of the Zimbabwe Migrants Support Network, told GroundUp that there are challenges in repatriating the three murdered Zimbabweans.\n\nTransporting one body to Zimbabwe costs about R32,000. Mapingure has been sourcing funds from Zimbabwean communities across the Eastern Cape, but says: We still have a long way to go.\n\n",
