            "content": "By News Agencies\n\nUKRAINIAN President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has urged Donald Trump to broker peace in Ukraine like in the Middle East during a phone call, saying if the United States president could stop one war, others can be stopped as well.\n\nSaturdays call came a day after Russia launched a large-scale attack on Ukraines energy grid, knocking out power to parts of the capital, Kyiv, and nine other Ukrainian regions, which have since been restored.Diplomatic efforts to end Russias invasion of Ukraine have slowed in recent weeks, in part because global attention has shifted to brokering a ceasefire in Israels war on Gaza, Kyiv said.Trump, who announced the first phase of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on Wednesday, met Russian President Vladimir Putin for talks in August but failed to secure progress on a ceasefire in the European war.I had a call with US President Donald Trump. A very positive and productive one, Zelenskyy said on Facebook, congratulating Trump for his outstanding ceasefire plan in the Middle East.If a war can be stopped in one region, then surely other wars can be stopped as well, including the Russian war, Zelenskyy added, calling for Trump to pressure the Kremlin into negotiations.Relations between the two leaders have warmed dramatically since February when they sparred during a televised meeting at the White House.Trump has since grown more hostile towards Russia while expressing sympathy for Ukraine.In September, he wrote on Truth Social that Kyiv should try to take back all its occupied territory with Europes and NATOs help.US first lady Melania Trump said on Friday that she had secured the release of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia after establishing an extraordinary back channel of communication with Putin.Russian attacks on Ukraine killed at least five people on Saturday and cut power to parts of southern Ukraines Odesa region, according to Ukrainian officials.Two of the people died inside a church in Kostyantynivka when it was hit by a strike, according to local authorities.Ukraines largest private energy company, DTEK, said the main work to restore the power supply was completed but some localised outages were still affecting the Ukrainian capital after Fridays massive Russian attacks.Ukrainian drone attacks, meanwhile, killed two people in Russia, according to regional officials.In the Russian border region of Belgorod, a truck driver was killed by a Ukrainian strike, according to local officials.Russia has targeted Ukraines energy grid each winter since it launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, cutting power and heating to millions of households and disrupting water supplies in what Kyiv says is a brazen war crime.Russia denies targeting civilians and says Ukraine uses the energy sites to power its military sector.Both countries have accused each other in recent months of frustrating progress towards a peace deal.Russia blames Ukraine and its European allies for the impasse, accusing them of undermining peace negotiations with Washington. Ukraine and Europe accuse Russia of playing for time so it can seize more Ukrainian territory.Zelenskyy said in his nightly address on Friday that Russia was taking advantage of the world being almost entirely focused on the prospect of establishing peace in the Middle East and called for strengthening Ukraines air defence systems and placing tighter sanctions on Russia.Russian assets must be fully used to strengthen our defence and ensure recovery, he said in the video, posted to X.\n\nSaturdays call came a day after Russia launched a large-scale attack on Ukraines energy grid, knocking out power to parts of the capital, Kyiv, and nine other Ukrainian regions, which have since been restored.\n\nDiplomatic efforts to end Russias invasion of Ukraine have slowed in recent weeks, in part because global attention has shifted to brokering a ceasefire in Israels war on Gaza, Kyiv said.Trump, who announced the first phase of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on Wednesday, met Russian President Vladimir Putin for talks in August but failed to secure progress on a ceasefire in the European war.I had a call with US President Donald Trump.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nAS the Zanu PF annual conference kicks off this week, the ruling party is urging discipline within its rank-and-file amid social media claims alleging plans to heckle Vice President Constantino Chiwenga during the event, as the succession debate intensifies.\n\nChiwenga is widely regarded as the frontrunner to succeed President Emmerson Mnangagwa in 2028 when his second term expires. However, his path to the presidencywhile seemingly straightforwardis reportedly being obstructed by Mnangagwas loyalists, who are pushing for an extension of the Presidents tenure to 2030.\n\nAmong these loyalists is a group of controversial business figures, including convicted businessman Wicknell Chivayo, Paul Tungwarara, and Kudakwashe Tagwirei, who have publicly and repeatedly pledged to support Mnangagwas continued leadership beyond 2028.\n\nIn recent days, social media has been awash with claims that Zanu PF youths are being bussed to Mutare, Manicaland province, for the sole purpose of booing Chiwengaa development seen as a sign that the succession battle is escalating.\n\nZanu PF Director of Communication, Farai Marapira, dismissed the allegations, insisting that the partys conference would not be used to heckle senior leaders, as attendance is restricted to vetted delegates.\n\nWe are not going to a rally. We are going to a conference. This is not a free for all. This is a meeting of delegates. This is a meeting of leadership. There is no time to heckle. This is just once again social media trying its best to push agendas on us as Zanu PF. But of course it will fail, he said.\n\nMarapira further stated that those promoting claims of planned disruption were ignorant of the partys internal procedures.\n\nThis issue of being bussed to boo, how are they going to enter when they are not accredited? We are not accrediting crowds, we are accrediting delegates. This is mischief being created by people who are ignorant of the ways of the party and how it conducts its conferences, Marapira said.\n\nThe alleged plans to heckle Chiwenga come against the backdrop of his sustained stance against corruption, which he has consistently described as a threat to national security. Chiwenga has publicly condemned prominent businessmenamong them Chivayo, Tungwarara, Tagwirei, and Delish Nguwayathough without naming them directly, referring instead to the group as Zvigananda a deragatory term for plunderers.\n\nLast month, Chiwenga reportedly presented a detailed corruption dossier during a Zanu PF Politburo meeting, implicating Nguwaya, Chivayo, Tagwirei, and Tungwarara. Analysts claim the dossier was so damaging that President Mnangagwa had to abandon his planned trip to the United States, where he was scheduled to lead Zimbabwes campaign for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA SUPERVISOR at China Zhuhe Mining, identified as Zilu, has been charged with murder by police after allegedly killing a local man, Fungai Nhau, on Thursday.\n\nIt is alleged Zilu fired live ammunition at the deceased in the fatal shooting which occurred in Mutoko, Mashonaland East province.The mining company claims that Nhau, along with accomplices, invaded the mining premises with the intention of committing a crime, including theft. They say Zilu fired warning shots into the air to deter the would-be robbers.The mining firm further stated that Nhaus body was discovered a kilometre away from the company premises, having been abandoned by his accomplices.Zilu, the supervisor, is said to have rushed to the scene where the body was found and spoke with the deceased, who purportedly confirmed he had been injured during the attempted robbery and then deserted by his colleagues.At approximately 7am the same day, local workers on the early shift discovered a critically injured gangster about 1kilometre from the crime scene. They promptly reported the matter to Mr. Zilu, the local translator who also served as the direct supervisor.Mr. Zilu rushed to the scene immediately; upon questioning the gangster, the latter admitted to being injured during the robbery and abandoned at the scene by his accomplices. Mr. Zilu immediately arranged to report the case to the police, but unfortunately, the gangster had already passed away when the police arrived, part of the companys statement reads.However, China Zhuhe Minings version of events starkly contrasts with the police charge sheet for Zilu, thereby raising suspicion of a cover-up attempt.Accused person is an employee of Zhuhe Mining Investments, Mudzi and he is the security supervisor. On the 09th of October 2025 at around 0030hrs, the accused person was on duty when he observed the now deceased Fungai Nhau who was with his friends going towards carbon room where pregnant carbons are kept.He then suspected them to be thieves and fired ten live rounds towards the direction of the now deceased. This resulted in the bullet hitting the now deceased on the left lower back.The now deceased sustained an entry gunshot wound which resulted in the bullet lodging inside the body. The now deceased was carried by his friends for considerable distance of about a kilometre before they abandoned him.At about 0700hrs on the same day, the now deceaseds body was discovered by mine workers who then alerted the police. The body of the now deceased was conveyed to Mutoko Hospital where it was pronounced dead by a doctor. The fire arm used by the accused person in the shooting of the now deceased is held as an exhibit, part of the police charge sheet for Zilu reads.Renowned lawyer Fadzayi Mahere has questioned why the China Zhuhe Mining supervisor took the law into his own hands and why he failed to report the incident to the police for seven hours.The companys statement leaves more questions than answers. If only warning shots were fired into the air as alleged, how was a person killed? Why did the company officials take the law into their own hands instead of calling @PoliceZimbabwe?If this version is to be believed, why were the police not called for a good 7 hours yet the company officers knew theyd fired shots at people whom they spuriously conclude were robbers and gangsters? Is there any regret for the needless loss of life? Why are early Police reports suggesting the murder victim was a worker as opposed to a gangster as curiously alleged by the company?Mahere has urged the police to leave no stone unturned in their investigations, insisting that the perpetrator must face the full force of the law.The Mutoko incident highlights the ongoing tensions between local communities and Chinese investors.This is not an isolated incident; reports indicate that throughout the country, Chinese nationals are experiencing friction with local communities concerning working environments and conditions, safety protocols, and allegations of harassment.These tensions are further exacerbated by Chinese mining operations which, it is claimed, demonstrate a disregard for historical landmarks and sites of cultural significance to local populations. Recent inquiries have focused on the alleged destruction of Mutares Christmas Pass.Last week, former Cabinet Minister Fortune Chasi commented that the core issue lies not with the Chinese themselves, but with local individuals and leadership figures who are granting mining licences enabling Chinese companies to mine indiscriminately across the country, and who are failing to adequately oversee these activities within their respective jurisdictions.\n\nIt is alleged Zilu fired live ammunition at the deceased in the fatal shooting which occurred in Mutoko, Mashonaland East province.\n\nThe mining company claims that Nhau, along with accomplices, invaded the mining premises with the intention of committing a crime, including theft.

This resulted in the bullet hitting the now deceased on the left lower back.The now deceased sustained an entry gunshot wound which resulted in the bullet lodging inside the body. The now deceased was carried by his friends for considerable distance of about a kilometre before they abandoned him.At about 0700hrs on the same day, the now deceaseds body was discovered by mine workers who then alerted the police.
