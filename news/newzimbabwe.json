            "content": "Xinhua\n\nAuthorities in Zimbabwe are intensifying efforts to combat the smuggling of consumer goods into the country and the proliferation of counterfeit and substandard products in the market to safeguard public safety and protect the local industry.\n\nThe rise in smuggled goods is partly driven by public demand for affordable products in informal markets that operate outside regulatory frameworks, authorities said.\n\nTo address the trade in illicit goods, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is leading a multi-agency task force, including the police and the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority, aimed at curbing smuggling.\n\nStringent anti-smuggling measures have been put in place to protect our domestic industries from unfair competition posed by illegal imports, said Zimbabwes Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce Rajeshkumar Modi during a dissemination workshop for the Zimbabwe Industrial Reconstruction and Growth Plan (ZIRGP) in the capital of Harare on Tuesday.\n\nThe development of value chains also remains a priority, as the government has put in place measures to promote the procurement of domestically produced goods, he added.\n\nLaunched on Nov. 1, the ZIRGP is a short-term transitional manufacturing policy running through December 2025, focused on enforcing consumer protection and preventing the spread of smuggled, counterfeit, and substandard goods in the country. The plan builds on the recently concluded Zimbabwe National Industrial Development Policy, which ran from 2019 to 2023.\n\nAmong the governments measures to tackle smuggling are the establishment of police roadblocks along highways and inspections of retail outlets across the country.\n\nSmuggling also affects the collection of customs and excise duties and discourages investment, Finance, Economic Development, and Investment Promotion Minister Mthuli Ncube said during his 2025 national budget presentation in Parliament last month.\n\nIn addition, smuggling is a threat to public health and safety as smuggled goods, in particular, food items, medicines, and alcohol are not subject to health and safety controls, said Ncube.\n\nThe Consumer Protection Commission, a national body that safeguards consumer rights, recently reported the presence of counterfeit items in the market, including toothpaste, cooking oil, drinks, and baked beans.\n\nDont fall for fake products. They might be cheaper, but they can cost you your health, your safety, and even your life, warned the commission on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nConsumers have also raised concerns over the proliferation of products in the market.\n\nAuthorities should continue conducting impromptu inspections on retailers and vendors to protect the public especially as people do their end-of-year shopping for the holidays, said Leon Nkhata, a resident in Harare. He expressed concern about substandard goods, including repackaged and underweight products like mealie meal, rice, and sugar.\n\n",

Our target is to be operating in two regional countries by June 30 2025.\n\nRight now my feeling is that we are likely to get into the international markets much faster and quicker using some of our subsidiaries outside the bank because going the route of the bank establishment in a foreign land tends to be over-regulated in a lot of countries and the capital requirements for setting up a bank tend to be higher, he said.\n\nNyazema said CBZHL must not be viewed as just a bank but a group with subsidiaries which can be seized to perform regional tasks.\n\nSo we have businesses that are capital lite which have done so well locally. You look at our Asset Management which trades as Datvest . What will stop us from taking this company to another region and using its success story achieved in Zimbabwe?\n\nHe expressed optimism that by June 30 2025, CBZHL, through its subsidiaries, will be present in two countries in the region.\n\n",

The proposal is to ensure that the tax is applied on net rental income as opposed to gross revenue from rentals, the industry lobby group said.\n\nCZI further submitted that IMTT taxes the whole value chain resulting in up to 10% additional costs to products leaving local products priced relatively higher than regional products.\n\nThe Confederation of Zimbabwe Retailers (CZR) CZR proposed the removal of tax on fast foods and betting tax which seem to target the poor.\n\nThere are a number of taxes charged on the purchase of food such as VAT, IMTT and the proposed fast-food tax which further burdens the poor. Such taxes need stakeholder consultations before they are introduced, the retailers group said.\n\nThe Chamber of Mines noted that the 2025 National Budget Statement was announced at a time when the mining industry is operating below its potential on the back of a challenging environment characterised by weak commodity prices, foreign currency shortfalls, capital shortages and fragile power supply.\n\nCoupled with a high-cost structure on the backdrop of high royalties and taxes, high electricity tariff, exchange rate losses and high cost of funding mining projects, the viability of mining companies has been severely compromised. These challenges have combined to weigh down on the performance of the mining industry with mineral revenue coming down significantly and mining companies struggling to meet their production targets.\n\nThe proposal to extend the royalty on coal to all types of coal, including coking and industrial coal, will increase production costs in the energy sector. This extension translates into higher operational expenses, impacting various downstream industries. Specifically, the cost of generating thermal power is likely to rise, as this additional cost will be passed down to Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC), the miners group said.\n\nThe grouping contends that the agriculture industry, particularly the tobacco sector, will be directly affected by the increased cost of industrial coal used for tobacco curing.\n\nMiners also expressed dissatisfaction over Ncubespolicy to the effect that minerals will be deemed sold at the value determined on either the date the sales contract is entered or the date on which the purchaser receives the product, whichever is higher.\n\nThe proposed measure may lead to disputes between ZIMRA and taxpayers, as during periods of price declines, ZIMRA may require miners to pay royalties on unrealised cash proceeds, the Chamber of Mines said.\n\nMiners also contested the 20% Capital Gains Tax as too high and way beyond the regional averages. They were of the view that the tax must not be applied in retrospect and that the rate be maintained at 5% as effected in 2017.\n\nRoyalty for platinum is high at 7%, the Chamber of Mines recommends a commodity price-linked royalty framework for platinum as follows: a base royalty of 3 % for the platinum price of up to US$1,100 / ounce, a royalty rate of 5% for a platinum price between US$1,100 /ounce and US$1,400, a royalty rate of 7% for platinum price between US$1,400/ounce and US$2,000/ounce and a royalty of 10% for platinum price above US$2,000 ounce.\n\nRoyalty for diamonds at 10% is also impacting negatively on the viability of diamond projects. Producers of alluvial diamonds which are predominantly low quality are the most affected as their prices have taken a huge knock, the report reads.\n\n",

            "content": "By Nqoba M Sibenke\n\nOne thing I find fascinating is the mechanism that regulates our mood. Mood refers to a state of the mind at a certain time for example happiness, sadness, gloom, excitement etc.\n\nOur body has mood regulators in the form of hormones which determine our mood at a particular time. Hormones are chemicals that the body produces for specific functions. When we feel unhappy and stressed certain hormones are responsible for unhappiness. Similarly, there are also happy hormones or happy juices. These enhance our happiness and reduce stress. These are Oxytocin, endorphins, serotonin and Dopamine. These four juices work differently from each other. They also have different roles and characteristics.\n\nDOPAMINE\n\nDopamine is also known as the feel good hormone. It is both a neurotransmitter and a hormone. A neurotransmitter is a chemical that relays information between nerve cells in the brain and the rest of the body. As a neuro hormone, it is produced by the hypothalamus in the brain. Dopamine has several functions which include movement, memory, pleasurable reward and motivation, behaviour and cognition, attention, sleep and arousal, mood, and learning.\n\nDopamine has been said to function based on motivation and reward. When we do a pleasurable activity we feel motivated which stimulates the secretion of Dopamine. As Dopamine is released we feel good and motivated to do more of the pleasurable activity. However, this can also lead to addiction.\n\nWhen we have balanced levels of Dopamine we will feel happy, motivated, alert and focused. On the other hand low levels of the hormone result in poor memory, fatigue, sadness, mood swings, and poor concentration among others. There is also a relationship between levels of Dopamine and mental disorders like schizophrenia, Mania, ADHD, Parkinsons and Addictions. To have healthy Dopamine levels we need to engage more in activities that give us pleasure however moderation is essential.\n\nENDORPHINS\n\nEndorphins function as painkillers. They are in actual fact natural pain killers. They get their name from a combination of two words endogenous  and morphine . Most of us are aware of the function of morphine which is to ease pain. When we are hurt or are experiencing pain, nerves communicate with the brain and the brain releases Endorphins.\n\nEndorphins can be naturally stimulated by engaging in activity that rewards like eating, massage, intimacy, dancing and such activities. It should be noted that Endorphins might have similarities with Dopamine however their function is different.\n\nA deficiency of Endorphins can result in a number of negative symptoms such as anxiety, depression, addiction, and sleep disorders among many others.\n\nSEROTONIN\n\nLike Dopamine, Serotonin also doubles as a neurotransmitter. Its key functions include learning, memory, and happiness as well as regulating body temperature, sleep, sexual behaviour and hunger. It is a key hormone which is mostly found in the gut.\n\nSerotonin has been known to be a mood stabilizer. It creates a feeling of calmness and emotional stability. Lack of Serotonin may result in mood disorders, depression, anxiety, sleep disorders, digestive disorders, suicidal behaviour, OCD, phobia and many other issues. It is therefore important to ensure good production of Serotonin, this can be done by exercising and sunbathing moderately.\n\nOXYTOCIN\n\nThe love hormone  as it is commonly known, Oxytocin is responsible for enhancing happiness through bonding. It is produced in the hypothalamus. Oxytocin has been proven to be responsible for smooth labour during childbirth. After childbirth, it helps in lactation which is the production of milk for the baby.\n\nAmong its many functions, Oxytocin helps in regulating sleep and moods. It promotes overall wellness and mental stability. It is enhanced mostly by intimate actions like touch, hugging, cuddling, and sexual activity among many others.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nHaving discussed briefly about hormones that regulate mood and produce positive emotions, it is apparent that we can be deliberate in determining our mood.\n\nAn exception is in cases where the body is unable to produce the particular hormones. In such cases, medication is usually given for example Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors which help boost Serotonin levels and control Depression. Similarly, in the case of Dopamine, the doctor can prescribe antidepressants and dopamine reuptake inhibitors.\n\nMood has a huge impact on our total wellness hence the importance of acquiring knowledge on how we can harness the faculties that regulate mood.\n\nAs we approach the festive season, a season of joy, giving and all good things let us make the best of our happy hormones and help others to be happy too.\n\nNqoba Sibenke is a registered intern Counselling Psychologist and can be reached atnqoba.sibenke@icloud.com/ +263715330911\n\n",
