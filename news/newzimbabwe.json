Its a big problem that needs to get real attention, said Munetsi.\n\nWhile there are no official statistics on the number of players defrauded by bogus agents, FIFPro has intensified awareness campaigns across Africa to help players identify legitimate representation and avoid exploitation.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nHuge crowds of mourners in Kenya fled screaming after police fired gunshots and tear gas in a stadium where they had gathered to see the body of former Prime Minister Raila Odinga.\n\nSeveral people at the arena, located in the capital Nairobi, were reportedly injured in the chaos as security officers sought to disperse the surging crowds.\n\nIt is not yet clear whether the police were using live ammunition or rubber bullets.\n\nOdingas body was flown back from India, where he died on Wednesday morning. Thousands of supporters had earlier travelled to the countrys main airport to receive the coffin, in an outpouring of grief that forced a brief halt to flights.\n\nThe authorities said mourners had gained access to restricted areas, prompting a precautionary closure that lasted about two hours.\n\nFrom the airport, thousands of people moved in a procession to escort the vehicle carrying the body to the stadium, about 10km (six miles) from the city centre.\n\nBecause of the unexpectedly large crowds, the public viewing ceremony for Odingas body was moved to Nairobis Moi International Sports Centre in the Kasarani neighbourhood, rather than inside the parliament building where it was initially scheduled to take place.\n\nThe convoy arrived to a packed stadium, with more people waiting outside.\n\nMinutes afterwards, a large crowd breached a gate in the arena, prompting the police to fire tear gas. Masses of mourners rushed towards the exits in response.\n\nA BBC reporter at the scene also saw men in civilian clothing beating protesters with batons.\n\nAt least three people were visibly injured and one had a serious head wound, the AFP news agency reported.\n\nAfter the chaos had settled, government officials and dignitaries were able to view it the coffin.\n\nA stream of supporters had earlier gathered at Lee Funeral Home, where the body was first expected, and around parliament.\n\nI came here at six in the morning. We have been at the airport to welcome Baba [Odingas nickname], one mourner had told the BBC near the airport.\n\nWe are sad, we have been left as orphans. He is our father.\n\nMotorcycle rider William Otieno Adoyo said he was a Baba die-hard.\n\nWe want to see Baba, how do we know its him in the casket? Let them show us and well be contented, he told the BBC.\n\nMourners have been carrying twigs and palm branches, a symbol of mourning and grief among the Luo ethnic group that Odinga belonged to.\n\nThe state funeral will be held at the Nyayo National Stadium in Nairobi on Friday and on Saturday his body will be transported to Kisumu, a city in western Kenya on the shores of Lake Victoria  his political stronghold.\n\nMembers of the public will get a chance to view the body before he is buried on Sunday at his farm in Bondo, about 60km west of Kisumu.\n\nAccording to the family, it was Odingas wish to be laid to rest within the shortest time possible, ideally within 72 hours.\n\nThe 80-year-old former prime minister collapsed during a morning walk in India on Wednesday morning and he was taken to Devamatha Hospital, about 50km (30 miles) east of the port city of Kochi.\n\nA seven-day period of mourning has been declared. Odinga will also be accorded a state funeral with full military honours, Kenyan President William Ruto said.\n\nHe was towering figure in Kenyan politics and for many years was the countrys main opposition leader, losing five presidential campaigns, most recently three years ago.\n\n",

There is no proof whatsoever that the BBI Project is being funded by the named individuals. It appears the author is more seized with it and would have assisted us by unpacking it further, said Ziyambi.\n\nThe move has deepened tensions within Zanu PF, angering a faction backing Vice President Constantino Chiwenga as Mnangagwas successor.\n\nThis has created a tense atmosphere at the National Peoples Conference, which is being held in Mutare and is expected to cement last years resolution number one, extending Mnangagwas term.\n\nZiyambi further defended the BBI, describing it as a nation-building initiative rather than a treasonous plot.\n\nIt is surprising how the writer got hold of the Building Bridges Initiative (BBI) document if it was meant for Parliament. This tendency of stalking officials who are carrying out their duties is regrettable.\n\nThere is nothing treasonous about improving a political system. This BBI, which is being referred to, is not strange to us, and its actually promoting nation building and cohesion as compared to the authors divisive and inciteful document, said Ziyambi.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nThe US has downplayed claims that Hamas is violating the ceasefire deal with Israel by not returning all the bodies of dead hostages.\n\nOnly nine of the 28 dead hostages have been returned, with Hamas saying it needs time and specialised equipment to recover the others from the ruins of Gaza.\n\nThe latest wo bodies returned on Wednesday have been identified as Inbar Hayman and Sgt Maj Muhammad al-Atresh, the Israel Defense Forces said early on Thursday.\n\nThe row over the return of dead hostages has led Israel to limit promised aid supplies to Gaza, but two senior advisers to US President Donald Trump have said plans to demilitarise the Strip and build a new transitional government are under way.\n\nIn an update on the implementation of Trumps 20-point peace plan, the advisers told reporters that the US government did not so far believe Hamas had broken the agreement by not retrieving more remains.\n\nThe advisers argued that Hamas had acted in good faith by returning all living hostages and was working with various interlocutors to find and return the remains of the others.\n\nHamass armed wing said in a statement it was committed to the deal but had returned all the bodies of hostages it was able to reach.\n\nOne senior US adviser said the recovery of all the bodies could take weeks because of the level of destruction in Gaza.\n\nHe said rewards might be offered for Gazan civilians who gave information and that Turkish experts were expected to join the search.\n\nConfirming the return of two more deceased hostages on Thursday, the IDF said Hayman was 27 when she was killed by Hamas on 7 October 2023 at the Nova festival. Her body was taken into the Gaza Strip.\n\nSgt Maj al-Atresh, who was 39, fell in combat on the same day, the IDF said.\n\nHamas is required to fulfill its part of the agreement and make the necessary efforts to return all the hostages to their families and to a dignified burial, it added.\n\nIn a statement, the Hostages Families Forum said: The families of the hostages and of those released embrace the families of Inbar Hayman and Muhammad al-Atresh, whose loved ones came home yesterday for proper burial in Israel.\n\nAlongside the grief and the understanding that their hearts will never be whole, the return of Inbar and Muhammad, may their memories be a blessing, brings some measure of comfort to families who have lived with agonising uncertainty for over two years.\n\nWe will not rest until all 19 hostages are brought home.\n\nHamas is required to return all 28 dead hostages as part of thefirst phase of the Gaza peace plan.\n\nBut Hamass armed wing said in a statement the remaining bodies require significant efforts and specialised equipment to search for and retrieve, and we are making a great effort to close this file.\n\nEarlier, Israel said it would not compromise on hostage returns, saying the mission is not complete.\n\nIsraels defence minister said he had instructed the IDF to prepare a comprehensive plan to defeat Hamas in Gaza in the event of a renewal of the war.\n\nAfter meeting senior generals on Wednesday, Israel Katz said the military must be prepared to act if Hamas refuses to implement the peace plan.\n\nThe latest repatriations came after Israel said one of four bodies returned by Hamas on Tuesday was not one of the missing hostages.\n\nUN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcherhas urged Israel to immediately open all border crossings into Gazafor humanitarian aid, as called for in the ceasefire plan.\n\nIn a post on X, Fletcher said Hamas must make strenuous efforts to return all the bodies of the deceased hostages.\n\nHe added: As Israel has agreed, they must allow the massive surge of humanitarian aid  thousands of trucks a week  on which so many lives depend, and on which the world has insisted.\n\nHe called for a genuine, practical, problem-solving approach to removing remaining obstacles and said withholding aid from civilians is not a bargaining chip.\n\nTrumps ceasefire plan, which both Israel and Hamas accepted, envisaged the handover of all 48 hostages would be completed by noon on Monday. Hamas returned all the 20 living hostages on Monday.\n\nBut the US-brokered ceasefire agreement appears to acknowledge that Hamas and other Palestinian factions may not have been able to find all hostage remains before the initial deadline on Monday.\n\nUnder the agreement, Israel also agreed to hand over the bodies of 15 Palestinians in return for every deceased Israeli hostage.\n\nSo far, Israel has returned the bodies of 90 Palestinians in exchange for the Israeli hostages remains.\n\nMeanwhile in Gaza, residents report growing concern about the durability of the ceasefire  and food prices have surged as Palestinians stockpile food.\n\nTraders and suppliers in the enclave have been hoarding food items to create shortages and drive up profits, fearing that the war could resume, local residents told the BBC.\n\nEvery time we start to feel safe, new threats appear, and we fear the war will start all over again, says mother-of-six Neven Al-Mughrabi, a displaced resident from Gaza who lives in Khan Younis.\n\nI lost my house in Gaza City, I decided to stay here with my family because I dont trust the ceasefire and were sick of displacement.\n\nShe added that a trader in Khan Youniss main market said demand for flour, oil and sugar had surged within hours. Despite the sudden rise of prices by about 30%, people are buying as if they dont trust the calm will last long, everyone is afraid aid will stop, Neven says.\n\n",

            "content": "ESPN\n\nZimbabwesNate Landmanset a franchise tackles record for theLos Angeles Ramsin their 17-3 win over theBaltimore Ravensas Week 6 saw African players dominate on defense.\n\nTheSeattle SeahawksJaxon Smith-Njigbawas the one shining light on offense this week, but after coming flying out of the blocks at the start of the season, wide receivers with ties to the continent generally had a more quiet round.\n\nArguably more than any before, this week showed that the NFLs attempts to grow the sport in Africa are bearing fruit  both in terms of developments on and off the field.\n\nThe impenetrable Landman  born in Harare  set a Rams franchise record with 17 total tackles in their win over the Ravens, including a quarterback hit and eight solo tackles.\n\nA convert from rugby, former Colorado Buffaloes linebacker Landman had arguably the best game of his American football career in the Rams win. His defining moment came on the stroke of half-time, as he contributed to two crucial stops within 10 yards of the end zone, as well as another earlier tackle in the same drive which saw the Rams held up over the course of eight plays.\n\nAt the time, the scores were deadlocked at 3-3. The Rams defense, led by Landman, prevented the Ravens from taking control at a crucial point in the game. In the third quarter, the Rams themselves took charge and never looked back.\n\nWhat a stop by our guys, really buckling up there,Landman told Tom Bradyfor Fox Sports after the legendary quarterback selected him as his LFG Player of the Game. Thats the pride of the defense right there, how you play goal line, and we rose up to the occasion. Way to set the tone for the rest of the game.\n\nSmith-Njigba, who has ties to Sierra Leone through his grandfather, is on a run where everything he touches turns to gold  and much of what he touches turns to touchdowns.\n\nThe wide receiver scored a 61-yard touchdown in the Seattle Seahawks 20-12 win over theJacksonville Jaguars. It came at a crucial time, too, as the Seahawks had been 6-3 behind midway through the second quarter before he crept in behind the defense and latched onto aSam Darnoldpass.\n\nAlthough Landman walks away with Africas MVP honors this week as far as we are concerned, Smith-Njigba is the most likely candidate from the continent to be in the running for NFL MVP a the end of the season.\n\nSmith-Njigba made a total of eight catches for 162 yards. Although there were many other moments worth celebrating from players with ties to Africa in week 6  notably a hugely impressive 72-yard kick return fromKene Nwangwu(ties to Nigeria) in theNew York Jets defeat to theDenver Broncos there was ultimately nobody who could top Smith-Njigba in terms of a notable single play.\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nUchenna Nwosu who has family ties to Nigeria  got 1.5 sacks for the Seahawks in their win over the Jaguars.\n\nNigeria-born duoDavid OnyemataandRuke Orhorhoroeach picked up a sack as theAtlanta Falconsupset theBuffalo Bills24-14.Charles Omenihu who has ties to Nigeria through his parents  got one for theKansas City Chiefsas they gained a crucial 30-17 win over theDetroit Lions.\n\nEyioma Uwazurike who also has parental ties to Nigeria  made a sack for the Denver Broncos in their narrow win over the New York Jets.\n\nOdafe Oweh raised in a Nigerian household in New Jersey  also had a memorable Sunday as he got a sack on debut for theLos Angeles Chargersin their 29-27 win over theMiami Dolphins. Oweh was recently traded from the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nWeek 6 was one to remember for African-born players, with few if any that can compare in recent memory. Landman (born in Zimbabwe), Onyemata, Orhorhoro (both born in Nigeria) and Paye (born in Guinea) all had performances to remember.\n\nThere was a crucial development off the field, too, as Nigerian International Player Pathway (IPP) Program standout Basil Chijioke CJ Okoye was officially signed to the Baltimore Ravens active roster from their practice squad shortly before his third straight NFL regular season appearance.\n\nOkoye and the Ravens may have ended up on the losing side against Landmans Rams, but he  just as much as the Zimbabwean  will remember the weekend for years to come.\n\n",
