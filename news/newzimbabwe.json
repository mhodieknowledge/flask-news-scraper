            "content": "IOL\n\nPolice in Limpopo have arrested a 51-year-old Zimbabwean man who had been on the run after a violent love triangle turned deadly at Wegdraai Village, Maleboho.\n\nOn Wednesday morning,IOL reported thatthe horrific incident occurred on Monday at around 11 pm.\n\nThe suspect, who is the elder brother of a 20-year-old man arrested earlier this week, was cornered in the Alldays policing area on Tuesday night while attempting to flee the country.\n\nProvincial police spokesperson Colonel Malesela Ledwaba confirmed the arrest: The suspect, who had been on the run, was arrested at about 9 pm after he was found hiding in a truck headed towards Zimbabwe. Upon arrival, he was found carrying a bag of clothes in an attempt to flee the country. Like his younger brother, he was also found to be in the country illegally.\n\nThe case stems from the violent confrontation late on Monday after the brothers allegedly received information that the 55-year-old victim was romantically involved with the elder brothers girlfriend. They stormed into a homestead where the victim and a 38-year-old woman were present.\n\nOn arrival, a confrontation ensued, during which the elder brother allegedly attacked the man with an axe and severely injured the woman, said Ledwaba.\n\nParamedics certified the 55-year-old man dead at the scene, while the injured woman was rushed to hospital for urgent treatment.\n\nPolice swiftly arrested the younger brother at his home, where they recovered the bloodied axe, which he had allegedly tried to wash in an effort to destroy evidence. He was also confirmed to be an undocumented foreign national.\n\nBoth suspects  aged 20 and 51  face charges of murder, attempted murder, defeating the ends of justice, and contravention of the Immigration Act. They are scheduled to appear before the Senwabarwa Magistrates Court on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile,Limpopos provincial police commissioner, Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe,welcomed the swift arrest and applauded community members for helping police track down the fugitive.\n\nThis was a brutal act of violence. We call upon communities to continue working closely with the police. We will not tolerate such despicable behaviour, and no one is above the law, said Hadebe.\n\n",

            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo | IOL\n\nAdvocate Dali Mpofu, a senior member of theuMkhonto weSizwe (MK) party led by former president Jacob Zuma, has castigated deepening divisions among Africans, and called for development on the continent and the free movement of people.\n\nThe seasoned legal counsel was speaking at the launch ofZimbabwean veteran opposition politician Job Sikhalas book, Footprints in the Chains: The Life Story of Job Sikhala, in Johannesburg. Zimbabwean journalist and commentator Hopewell Chinono also attended and addressed the event.\n\nThe guest of honour at the Joburg event,Mozambican main opposition leader Venncio Mondlane, was allegedly blocked by Mozambican authorities from attending physically, but he addressed the event virtually.\n\nIn his address, Mpofu said Africans today are heavily dividedalong lines they cannot explain.\n\nIn the song (that was sung at the book launch event) somebody was talking about makwerekwere (a commonly used derogatory slur in South Africa against foreign nationals, particularly those from other African countries). We have allowed ourselves to be divided along lines that we also cannot even explain ourselves, said Mpofu.\n\nHow can we havemakwerekwerehere in Africa? Just tell me, how many people know that people of Matabeleland actually come from here? The entire Matabeleland  they come from here literally.\n\nMatabeleland is a vast region in southwestern Zimbabwe, named after the indigenous Ndebele people who reside there. It is divided into three modern-day provinces: Matabeleland North, Matabeleland South, and the city-province of Bulawayo.\n\nMpofu also referred to the sharing of languages among different groups of Africans found in different nations.\n\nThat is not a coincidence, we do not ask ourselves why? Why is that so? It is becauseMziilikaziwho moved from here, is the same person who was fighting alongside Shaka, and this is not a long time ago. It is less than 200 years ago. In historical terms, that is not a long time.\n\nBecause of those wars, Mzilikazi actually moved from what we call KZN (KwaZulu-Natal) now and lived here, in Gauteng, for a long time until the so-called Voortrekkers came and then it is only then that he moved across the Limpopo. So the very same people, who 200 years ago were sitting together in KZN are now calling each other  this one is makwerekwere. We must wake up as Africans, we really must, said the former chairperson of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF).\n\nHe said oppressors have used borders to divide Africans.\n\nWe worship things that have been imposed on us. Who came up with the borders? Was it us? In 1884 there was a meeting in Germany with white people only, not a single African. Not one African, I think even the people that were serving tea were white. And those people decided to cut our continent into pieces as they liked.\n\nIf my village and Jobs village, if they decided and cut it, he is now in another country and I am now in another country. They didnt care, they were cutting it according to the riches of the continent, said Mpofu.\n\nWhy is it that in the United States, you have 51 states and can move around without borders? Why are we as Africans not asking those questions? The answer is this: the only reason we are fighting is that we are not economically developing our continent.\n\nMpofu said if Africa was developing as a continent, there would be no need for the extensive restrictions on peoples movement.\n\nPeople do not move because they hate their homes. They move because of economic factors. That happens everywhere. I am here because of economic factors. I come from the Eastern Cape. So you can call me kwerekwere as well, said Mpofu.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nProminent musician Kudakwashe Hombarume, better known as Chillmaster, has been banned from driving for nine months by Mbare Magistrate Tendayi Mukurunge, who convicted him three months ago.\n\nThe development comes after his case was remitted back to the lower court for the magistrate to reconsider punishment and to conduct a mandatory inquiry into whether Hombarume should be prohibited from driving under section 64(3) of the Road Traffic Act.\n\nJudge President, Justice Mary Zimba-Dube, on automatic review, slammed the magistrate for trivialising the offence after he spared him jail and committed the musician to community service.\n\nIn his latestrevised ruling, Mukurunge banned Chillmaster from driving for nine months with no other conditions.\n\nThe High Court had blasted the Mbare magistrate for imposing community service on a 24-year-old unlicensed musician ruling that the sentence trivialised the seriousness of culpable homicide arising from road traffic accidents.\n\nDelivering judgment on review, Justice Dube said the trial court misdirected itself by treating the offence as one of ordinary negligence when in fact the accuseds conduct showed gross negligence.\n\nThe facts of this case reveal a serious breach of road safety regulations by an offender who, without restraint, takes it upon himself to drive a vehicle without a licence, speeds and causes an accident leading to loss of life of an innocent person, Justice Dube wrote. Contrary to a finding of ordinary negligence, the facts disclose gross negligence.\n\nHombarume admitted driving a Honda Shuttle at up to 100 km/hr in a 60 km/h zone when he struck and killed 46-year-old Custon Charumbira in April this year.\n\nHe had no drivers licence.\n\nThe trial court sentenced him to 24 months imprisonment, wholly suspended on condition that he performs community service and does not commit a similar offence.\n\nJustice Dube said the magistrate erred by placing undue weight on the victim impact statement from Charumbiras widow, who had recommended a non-custodial sentence after the accused paid compensation, funeral expenses and pledged further support.\n\nA victim impact statement cannot trump the interests of justice, said the judge.\n\nCourts should not allow offenders to buy themselves out of a custodial sentence simply because they can pay compensation.\n\nThe judge stressed that with Zimbabwe facing high rates of accidents on our roads, courts had a duty to send a strong warning to offenders who drive without licences resulting in fatalities, that such conduct will attract censure of the courts.\n\nThe High Court withheld its confirmation of sentence, remitting the matter to the magistrate to reconsider punishment and to conduct a mandatory inquiry into whether Hombarume should be prohibited from driving under section 64(3) of the Road Traffic Act.\n\nThe aggravating features of this case do not justify community service, Justice Dube concluded. Community service imposed in circumstances such as these has the effect of trivialising the offence of culpable homicide arising from road traffic accidents.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nOUTSPOKEN politician Temba Mliswa has denied allegations of luring Walter Mzembi back to Zimbabwe for incarceration, claiming the former cabinet minister was living in fear after a fallout with exiled ex-ZANU PF commissar Saviour Kasukuwere.\n\nMzembi returned to Zimbabwe after seven years of exile and has been in pretrial detention for violating his 2018 bail conditions.\n\nAt the centre of his return and subsequent arrest was allegedly Mliswa, an accusation which he denies.\n\nThe Mzembi issue is an unfortunate exhibition of callous politicians conveniently altering facts and pseudo-journalists crafting an alternative reality for excitable masses to imbibe on. Its a total shame to accuse me or anyone of enticing him back. This was his own idea, said Mliswa in a social media post.\n\nMliswa said the return of Mzembi was of his own volition due to fear of Kasukuwere after a fallout.\n\nThe facts are verifiable. There was never any CIO operation because Mzembi approached me as he wanted to return. One major reason is that he had split with Kasukuwere. For more than a year and half they have never spoke. He felt unsafe which is why he moved from SA to Zambia!\n\nAll this talk about me selling him out is noonday hogwash. Im no spy and never worked for CIO. Characters like Ali Naka, are merely (social media) guns for hire operating as Sekuru Tysons instruments. Ali is working for his food and will peddle any nonsense he is fed.\n\nInstead, they should admit how Mzembi was pushed back here due to fear of Kasukuwere as he no longer felt safe. He crafted his own idea, approached me to facilitate engagements with the relevant powers. Which I did. What part of those actions constitutes enticing him back? said Mliswa.\n\nThe alleged fallout between Kasukuwere and Mzembi comes as a surprise, as the two had been as thick as thieves and worked together during the 2023 election season.\n\nNow languishing in prison, Mzembi is reportedly ill as he awaits the commencement of his trial.\n\nI have always advocated for the return of everyone in exile. For both times involving Mzembi and Kasukuwere in 2018 when approached I simply spoke with the powers that be and facilitated engagements between the parties. Whatever else they agreed or didnt, I was never part of!\n\nAccusations of betrayal are outright fabrications by individuals like Ali Naka who are mere marionettes in this charade. Mzembi is not a victim of anything I did but of that which compelled him to flee from SA. Whatever agreements they spoke about back here I was never part of, added Mliswa.\n\n",
