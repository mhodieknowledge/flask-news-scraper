explosives.Images of him in handcuffs were plastered over the internet, with Zanu PF acolytes celebrating it like a win.He is being held at Pretoria Central and expected to appear in court on

out.He said he did not come here for explosives but for medical attention.Indeed, Sikhala has been frequenting South Africa for medical help after spending over 500 days in pretrial detention before

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nA FORWARD-THINKING fintech company, EazzyPay, based in Zimbabwe, has officially launched a comprehensive digital payment platform aimed at streamlining both individual and business financial transactions.\n\nThe platform, accessible via mobile app, WhatsApp bot, and web interface, offers a seamless experience for a range of services, from purchasing electricity tokens and airtime to booking event tickets, paying bills, and even accessing corporate solutions like bulk airtime purchases and virtual fiscalisation devices.\n\nEazzyPays launch comes at a time when digital payment adoption in Zimbabwe is accelerating.\n\nAccording to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), the total transaction value processed via digital payment systems reached ZWL 205.49 billion (approx. US$7.78 billion) in August, with 71.42 million transactions recorded. In contrast, cash-based transactions totalled only ZWG 12.66 billion.\n\nSpeaking at the official launch event in Harare, EazzyPays Chief Executive Officer, Tabeth Revesai Nyahasha, emphasised the platforms potential to revolutionise the way Zimbabweans engage with digital finance.\n\nWith our unified approach, we aim to eliminate the inefficiencies that have historically plagued digital payments  from multiple platforms and long wait times to limited access and a lack of transaction transparency, Nyahasha said.\n\nOur mission is to empower communities by offering a faster, more secure, and more accessible payment solution.\n\nThe Zimbabwean fintech landscape is rapidly evolving. Data from the central bank reveals that electronic transactions processed through the National Payment Systems (NPS) grew by 23.09% in Q2 2025, reaching ZWL 655.6 billion (approximately US$24.33 billion). Despite this growth, EazzyPay identified a gap in the market for a unified platform to address the fragmented nature of digital payments, particularly for retail transactions, which accounted for US$5.93 billion in the second quarter alone.\n\nPayments Made Easy  EazzyPays tagline  underscores its core promise: simplifying financial transactions for both individuals and businesses. The platform seeks to increase financial inclusion, particularly in underserved rural areas, by offering a solution that removes barriers such as long queues, restrictive operating hours, and complex user interfaces.\n\nAlex Kuzakwawo, EazzyPays Operations Director, assured users of the platforms robust security features.\n\nWith WhatsApps end-to-end encryption, all transactions are safeguarded, ensuring that only the user has access to their financial information, he explained.\n\nFurthermore, payments are validated by EcoCash, where the users PIN is required for authorization. EazzyPay itself is a facilitator, ensuring that security protocols are strictly adhered to.\n\nAs Zimbabwe continues to transition towards a predominantly digital economy, EazzyPays platform is poised to become a key player in driving both financial inclusion and economic participation across the country. The launch reflects the broader trend of fintech innovation across Africa, where digital solutions are helping bridge the gap between the unbanked and essential financial services.\n\nBy replacing fragmentation with integration, were not just simplifying payments  were enabling a more inclusive, connected economy, added Nyahasha.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE Supreme Court has ruled in favour of Crest Breeders International (Pvt) Ltd, ordering the registration of its compensation agreement with the Government of Zimbabwe over the compulsory acquisition of its 1,057-hectare property and criticising the lower court for revisiting a matter that had already been concluded.\n\nIn a ruling delivered on October 30, 2025, Justices George Chiweshe, Chinembiri Bhunu, and Joseph Musakwa allowed the appeal with costs on the legal practitioner and client scale, setting aside a 2022 Administrative Court decision that had dismissed the companys application.Chiweshe, writing for the court, said the matter was res judicata, having already been determined by the Supreme Court in an earlier judgment. He said the lower court erred in entertaining a matter with regards to which it had previously rendered a determination.Not only was the court a quo functus officio, it disregarded the doctrine of stare decisis by purporting to overturn the decision of this court concerning the same parties, the same facts and the same cause of action, said Chiweshe.The case involved Crest Breeders former property, the remaining extent of Saturday Retreat in Harare, which the government sought to compulsorily acquire in 2013 under the Land Acquisition Act. Following objections, the company and government reached an agreement in which Crest Breeders would retain 407 hectares and be compensated for the remainder. Occupants of the land were to pay four United States dollars per square metre for the portions they occupied.The agreement was initially approved by the Administrative Court and confirmed by the Supreme Court. However, a group of 11 settlers later challenged the registration, claiming the deal was fraudulent and unfair. In 2022, the Administrative Court sided with the settlers, a decision which has now been overturned.The Supreme Court said the settlers had no legitimate claim to the property or the agreement.If truth be told, the core respondents are illegal settlers, with no legitimate claim to the appellants property, he said.They were not privy to the agreement nor were they adversely affected by its terms.He said the respondents had no locus standi to challenge the deal since they were neither parties to the agreement nor recognised beneficiaries of the land reform programme.The core respondents embarked from the very beginning on a futile exercise to assert what they perceived to be their rights, he said.The court reaffirmed the States right to acquire private land in the public interest upon payment of compensation.The sovereign State of Zimbabwe has eminent domain over all private property within its territory and can acquire such property in the public interest against payment of compensation.The judges ordered that the memorandum of agreement between Crest Breeders and the Government of Zimbabwe be registered in terms of the Administrative Court (Land Acquisition) Rules of 1998.They also ordered the settlers to pay costs of the appeal on the legal practitioner and client scale.Despite glaring shortcomings, the core respondents persisted with their claims, thereby putting the appellant unnecessarily out of pocket. The appellants request for costs on the attorney and client scale was meritorious, the court ruled.Crest Breeders was represented by Advocate Lewis Uriri and T.S. Nyawo of Nyawo Ruzive Attorneys, while the Ministry of Lands was represented by L.T. Muradzikwa.The settlers were represented by J. Koto of Koto & Company.\n\nIn a ruling delivered on October 30, 2025, Justices George Chiweshe, Chinembiri Bhunu, and Joseph Musakwa allowed the appeal with costs on the legal practitioner and client scale, setting aside a 2022 Administrative Court decision that had dismissed the companys application.\n\nChiweshe, writing for the court, said the matter was res judicata, having already been determined by the Supreme Court in an earlier judgment.

Why do you believe so many Zimbabweans are running away? It was not always the case. What changed?\n\nRespectfully to what extent has South Africa, through successive administrations, taken an honest view about the Zimbabwean crisis?\n\nUnless these questions are addressed, you will most likely continue to have hordes of Zimbabweans braving high fences, vicious crocodiles, the vagaries of the Limpopo and your law enforcement in order to escape the bigger crocodiles back home, said Mahere.\n\nNumerous attempts by South Africa to curb illegal migration from Zimbabwe have been futile, prompting vigilante groups to attack foreign nationals.\n\nRamaphosa said his government is holding engagements with countries whose nationals are in South Africa illegally.\n\nEngagements with countries whose nationals are frequent transgressors are ongoing through discussions with embassies, and these matters are also included as an Agenda item on Bi-National Commissions. This is to ensure that the implication of illegal migration is understood.\n\nIllegal immigration does place a strain on our social services and undermines our national security.\n\nWe should not allow vigilante acts targeting foreign nationals as these do not solve the problem and they undermine the rule of law, said Ramaphosa.\n\n",
