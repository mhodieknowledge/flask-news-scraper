The remittances have had a favourable impact on the current account balance.\n\nTo year end, remittances are projected to increase by 4.9% from US$2.6 billion in 2024 to US$2.7 billion in 2025, sustaining a positive current account balance. Given the strategic importance of the diaspora community, the Government seeks to strengthen their role in the development of the country, he said.\n\nNcube said the government is finalising the formulation of the Diaspora Policy, which will outline measures to promote remittances at a minimum cost and give guidelines on various investment initiatives.\n\nDuring the period, direct investment inflows were estimated at US$184,9 million in the first quarter of 2025, up from US$103,5 million recorded in the corresponding quarter of 2024.\n\nThe inflows were mainly in the form of capital equipment, predominantly directed towards the mining and manufacturing sectors.\n\nDuring the quarter, 207 new investment licenses were issued, marking a 44.8% increase compared to the corresponding period in 2024.\n\nThe successful launch of ZIDAs digital investment license issuance system is anticipated to streamline processes, thereby enhancing investor confidence and operational efficiency.\n\nDirect investment inflows are projected to grow to over US$600 million in 2025, with the major recipients being the energy, mining and manufacturing sectors.\n\n",

Ms Pierce toldMIT Technology Reviewher family thought its like something from a sci-fi movie.\n\nIt is believed to be longest that an embryo has been frozen before resulting in a successful live birth. The previous record-holder wasa pair of twins who were born in 2022 from embryos frozen in 1992.\n\nThe Pierces had tried to have a child for seven years before they decided to adopt the embryo Linda Archerd, 62, made with her then-husband in 1994 through IVF.\n\nAt the time, Ms Archerd initially created four embryos. One become her now-30-year-old daughter, and the other three were left in storage.\n\nDespite separating from her husband, she did not want to get rid of the embryos, donate them for research or give them to another family anonymously.\n\nShe said it was important that she was involved with the baby, as they would be related to her adult daughter.\n\nMs Archerd paid thousands of dollars a year for storage until she found a Christian embryo adoption agency, Nightlight Christian Adoptions, which runs a programme known as Snowflakes. Many of these agencies consider their programmes to be saving lives.\n\nThe programme used by Ms Archerd allows donors to choose a couple, meaning they can state religious, racial and nationality preferences.\n\nMs Archerds preference was for a married Caucasian, Christian couple living in the US, as she didnt want to go out of the country, she told MIT Technology Review.\n\nShe ultimately matched with the Pierces.\n\nThe IVF clinic in Tennessee at which the couple underwent the procedure, Rejoice Fertility, said its aim was to transfer any embryo it received, no matter the age or conditions.\n\nMs Pierce said she and her husband did not set out to break any records, but just wanted to have a baby.\n\nMs Archerd told MIT Technology Review she had not met the baby in person yet, but could already see a resemblance with her daughter.\n\n",

The capital deployment to the portfolio companies is guided by the Investment Strategy of the Fund and the diagnostic assessment report, prioritising long-term value creation, stability and prosperity, Ncube said.\n\nInvestments currently under consideration include procurement of buses for the Zimbabwe United Passenger Company (ZUPCO) to minimise public transport challenges, capitalisation of the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) to rehabilitate rail infrastructure and address rolling stock challenges, crafting of sustainable operational models for COTTCO, Air Zimbabwe, Cold Storage Company and Silo Food industries, among others.\n\nThe Fund is also working with the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) on a variety of initiatives to address power shortages, which include enhancing base load, together with the implementation of prepaid, net and smart metering projects.\n\nBased on the current and projected investments in the energy sector, the Fund is optimistic that load shedding will be significantly minimised in the outlook period, not least because of the rehabilitation of Hwange Units 1 to 6 under a Rehabilitate Operate and Transfer concession agreement between Zimbabwe Power Company and Jindal Africa, added Ncube.\n\n",

The accumulation of arrears since the year 2000 have been worsening the country`s debt situation, constraining access to external concessional financing.\n\nIn this regard, the government is implementing the Arrears Clearance and Debt Resolution Roadmap in order to restore debt sustainability and unlock critical external financing needed for the countrys development programs, he said.\n\nDomestic debt service in local currency totalled ZiG1.64 billion, comprising both principal and interest payments during the period January to June 2025.\n\nDuring the period January to June 2025, Treasury made payments amounting to US$176.28 million for external debt service, which includes US$93.72 million towards the active portfolio, US$79.75 million for legacy debts and US$2.81 million of token payments to the International Financial Institutions and the sixteen Paris Club Bilateral Creditors.\n\nOf this, ZiG39.52 million was paid towards interest payments and ZiG1.60 billion for principal payments related to ZiG-denominated Treasury Bills and bonds.\n\n",
