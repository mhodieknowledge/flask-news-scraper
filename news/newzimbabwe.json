The performance will mark a full circle for the jestmaster, who was nurtured through the incubation of the Magamba Network, the organisers of the Shoko Festival.\n\nKandoro, who has sold-out shows in Harare in the past, will be supported by Kenyas Justine Wanda, Munyaradzi Chipere, and Mbongeni Ignatious Ndlovu.\n\nShoko Festival director, Samm Farai Monro, says this years edition will honour the legacy that has been built over the past 15 years.\n\nOur Comedy Night lineup is a reflection of the legacy we have been building over 15 years as Shoko Festival. King Kandoro is an example of that legacy as he grew his comedy career through platforms created by Magamba TV and Shoko and is now one of Zimbabwes biggest comedians.\n\nHe returns triumphantly to Shoko as a headliner and this shows our commitment to nurturing the next generation of artists in Zimbabwe who speak truth to power. Kandoro will be joined on stage by an amazing group of comedians. Its gonna be a hilarious night! says Monro.\n\nKandoro is expected to surpass the performance standard set by Learnmore Jonasi, who was the headliner last year.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA Magunje family was left shattered after their 20-year-old son murdered his own sister in cold blood, then lost his sight on the eve of his trial.\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Philda Muzofa, sitting with assessors in Chinhoyi, convicted Isaac Mashonga, now 28, of brutally killing his sister, Dadirai Mashonga, in their kitchen hut in Mashonga Village, Zvipani, Magunje, in July 2017.\n\nThe horror began when their 93-year-old father, Champion Mashonga, and his wife woke up to find their daughters headless body sprawled in blood.\n\nNo parent can imagine one of his or her children beheading his sibling in their kitchen, Muzofa said while delivering her judgment, calling it a tragedy that will haunt this family and community forever.\n\nOn the night of July 13, 2017, Isaac, then 20, arrived at his parents home in the company of a local businessman known as Giant, real name Robert Tichareva.\n\nThe businessman was arrested together with Mashonga, but has since passed on.\n\nProsecutors told the court the two had conspired to kill Dadirai for ritual purposes, with Isaac allegedly promised US$4,000 for the beheading.\n\nThat night, Dadirai was fast asleep in the kitchen hut.\n\nVillagers later testified that Isaac led Robert straight to her room.\n\nInside, she was strangled and then decapitated using a kitchen knife, axe and adze.\n\nThe pair stuffed the head into a green satchel and smuggled it out to a derelict building near the business centre.\n\nThe following morning, Isaac returned to the homestead wearing blood-soaked clothes.\n\nVillagers who gathered at the gruesome scene apprehended him, tied his hands, and later forced him to lead them to the hidden satchel. Inside was Dadirais head.\n\nHe confessed and showed us the weapons, testified his father, Champion. As a father, I had no reason to misrepresent the facts. I was simply a troubled father.\n\nAs if the ordeal was not enough, Isaac lost his sight while awaiting trial.\n\nPrison doctors confirmed he is now 80% blind, a development that deepened his elderly parents pain.\n\nFor this elderly couple, they have lost two children at the same time  one through death and one through incarceration, the judge noted.\n\nInside prison, Isaacs blindness has left him dependent on fellow inmates for food, bathing and movement. Being blind and in prison presents a double challenge, the court acknowledged, though ruling that disability could not shield him from punishment.\n\nIsaac had claimed he was drugged by Robert and acted under the businessmans instructions. But Justice Muzofa dismissed his story as far-fetched and chicanery.\n\nThe accused literally took the Court for granted, the judge said. He carried the satchel fully aware that it had his sisters head. He then went to sleep. How can a person conduct himself likewise and yet claim he was intoxicated?\n\nThe court found that Isaac acted as a willing accomplice. The proved facts admit of no other inference except that the accused was part of this grand plan, Justice Muzofa ruled.\n\nThe judge said the killing had induced a sense of shock and revulsion in the community and branded it murder in aggravating circumstances.\n\nAlthough Isaacs youth, six years in pre-trial custody and his disability were considered, the court said retribution and deterrence must prevail.\n\nHe now faces decades behind bars,blind, broken, and carrying the weight of a family curse: the brother who killed his sister and destroyed his parents twilight years.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) has warned that while the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwes (RBZ) tight Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) has helped ease inflationary pressures, it has also significantly dampened demand.\n\nThe RBZ has maintained a restrictive monetary policy to stabilise prices, the exchange rate, and the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency. Current measures include a high policy rate of 35%, a statutory reserve requirement of 15% for savings and time deposits, and 30% for demand and call deposits.\n\nThe policy framework is designed to support the ZiG, which was introduced to restore confidence and stability in the economy. The central bank has been working to maintain the currencys stability against the US dollar.\n\nIn its latest inflation tracker, CZI noted that while the fall in inflation confirms the effectiveness of the current monetary stance in stabilising prices, the downside has been a steep decline in aggregate demand.\n\nWhile tight liquidity is helping stabilise prices, it also has negative implications on demand and hence business output and growth. Therefore, in the long term, monetary policy has to ease tight liquidity conditions as stability becomes sustainable, the industry grouping said.\n\nCZI said keeping inflation below 1% enhances price stability and goes a long way in broadening the use of ZiG beyond a transaction currency, while acknowledging that businesses that previously preferred to trade in USD transactions only are beginning to slowly encourage ZiG payments to help them settle some of their monthly obligations.\n\nThe industry grouping said the high annual inflation rate of 93,8% is still reflective of the September 2024 devaluation of ZiG, hence will only ease in October, provided there is no other shock in the inflation drivers to cause high month-on-month inflation.\n\nIn comparison, the US$ prices remained the same between July and August 2025 as the main driver of USD inflation (S.I. 81A of 2024) was repelled in early 2025. Some of the possible signals to be derived from the stable USD prices include greater predictability in input and output costs for businesses that largely operate in US$.\n\nThe industry grouping warned that the gap between the official and parallel market rates could motivate traders to abandon the formal market.\n\n",
