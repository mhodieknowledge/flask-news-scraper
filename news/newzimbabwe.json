            "content": "By lOL\n\nTHE Stilfontein Crisis Committee is mulling over charging government with murder after the bodies of more than 70 miners were brought to the surface this week.\n\nThese miners were part of a larger group that languished underground for more than two months after a stand-off with policing and mining authorities over illegal mining activities at disused mine shafts.\n\nSpeaking to Newzroom Afrika, the committees chairperson, Christopher Rutledge, accused government of making comments while the miners were underground, indicating its intention of killing them.\n\nWe are going to consider a number of routes, including charging individuals and the state with murder, he said.\n\nHe said the committee will also ask for an inquiry similar to the Life Esidimeni inquiry following the deaths of 141 mentally-challenged patients.\n\nRutledge said government had been provided with information about the miners and the conditions they were in, while underground.\n\nGovernment was provided with information that the miners in shaft 11 had no access to exit the mine.\n\nSpeaking to Newzroom Afrika, he said the only other exit was through shaft 10, and this where bodies of dead miners lay.\n\nRutledge explained that the exit through shaft 10 was dangerous as the structure itself was compromised.\n\nIt has rusty, rickety iron poles that people have to climb and if you lose your footing while climbing up almost two kilometres, you will fall down, and it is very unlikely that you will survive and be recovered. That was the one opportunity in our view that was unreasonable to expect people to exit the mine, he said.\n\nAccording to Rutledge, government was provided with clear information on the underground conditions and those trapped in shaft 11 were unable to exit without assistance.\n\nMoving forward, he said the commission will also look at seeking constitutional damages as this action was a violation of rights.\n\nAccording to police, 246 illegal miners have been rescued from the North West mine.\n\nThe operation was undertaken by different specialists health-care professionals led by acting Deputy Director General for Hospitals and Clinical Support, Agisanang Portia Tlou, Chief Director for Hospitals and Clinical Support Services Zenzo Ndabula, and Chief Director for Dr. Kenneth Kaunda district, Phil Maboe.\n\nNational police spokesperson, Colonel Athlenda Mathe, said nine illegal miners had been taken for medical check-ups while the rest were taken in police custody.\n\nThe illegal miners are from; Mozambique, Lesotho, Zimbabwe with at least five being South African.\n\n",

In Luke 5:1-11, we see Jesus instructing Peter, a seasoned fisherman, to cast his nets into the deep waters during the day.\n\nDespite the seeming foolishness of this action, Peter obeyed, acknowledging Jesus authority. It was common knowledge that fishing couldnt be done in the afternoon because fish would see the nets and wouldnt enter. This act of faith led to a miraculous catch.\n\nThe power of Gods word lies in its ability to transcend human understanding. Its not about conventional or scientific logic or reason; its about trusting in the One who speaks.\n\nAs Romans 1:17 says, The just shall live by faith. Faith is the language of Gods operation, and its the only way to please Him (Hebrews 11:6).\n\nJesus emphasizes the importance of faith in Mark 11:22-24. He tells His disciples to have faith in God and assures them that whatever they ask for in prayer, believing theyll receive it, will be theirs. This is not just a suggestion; its a command. Jesus wants us to trust Him completely, without questioning His ways.\n\nBut how do we develop this kind of faith? The answer lies in Gods word. As Psalm 119:160 says, The entirety of Your word is truth.\n\nWe must immerse ourselves in Scripture, allowing its truth to transform our minds and hearts. We must learn to trust Gods word, even when it seems foolish or contradictory to our scientific knowledge or circumstances.\n\nSo, lets approach Gods word with faith, not questioning its logic or reasonableness. Lets talk to Him through His word and prayer, trusting that He will guide us and bless us. Lets cast our nets deeper into the waters of Gods blessings, trusting in His word and His faithfulness.\n\nAs we close, remember that faith is not a feeling; its a choice. Choose to trust Gods word today, and watch Him work miracles in your life.\n\nPRAYER:\n\nDear Heavenly Father, we thank You for the power of Your word. Help us to trust in You, even when Your ways seem foolish to us. Give us the faith to take You at Your word, and may we experience the miraculous blessings that come from obeying Your instructions.\n\nMay Your word be our guide, our comfort, and our strength. In Jesus name, we pray.\n\nAMEN.\n\n",

Justice Pisirayi Kwenda ruled that the pair was facing a serious offence, which can result in their imprisonment for 20 years if convicted.\n\nOn Friday, Mpofus lawyer Advocate Tapson Dzvetero submitted that the two deserved bail considering that their co-accuseds from the local authority were granted bail.\n\nChimombe and Mpofu argued that this development constituted changed circumstances, considering the courts revised perspective on their prior bail request.\n\nAshiel Mugiya representing Chimombe concurred.\n\nMabhaudhi argued this had no relevance to the bail circumstances for the accused.\n\nThe granting of bail to city council officials has no bearing on the bail of these accused persons, Mabhaudhi said.\n\nAccording to the State, in January, the CoH initiated a project to rehabilitate streetlights in preparation for the SADC summit hosted by Zimbabwe in August.\n\nThe council invited bids, receiving submissions from 11 companies, including Juluka Endo Joint Venture (Pvt) Ltd, co-owned by Moses Mpofu.\n\nThe tender invitation specified that all bidders must provide stamped audited financial statements from the last two years.\n\nAdditionally, proof of payment for special procurement oversight committee and administration fees were required.\n\nOn April 19, an evaluation committee awarded contracts to four companies across eight lots for the street light rehabilitation project.\n\nMpofus company did not meet the requirements as its audited statements lacked an audit opinion, a crucial criterion for eligibility.\n\nNonetheless, the council invited Mpofus company to submit a new bid, which it did, presenting a document that allegedly contained false information.

            "content": "By Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON  The Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld the federal law banning TikTok beginning Sunday unless its sold by its China-based parent company, holding that the risk to national security posed by its ties to China overcomes concerns about limiting speech by the app or its 170 million users in the United States.\n\nA sale does not appear imminent and, although experts have said the app will not disappear from existing users phones once the law takes effect, new users wont be able to download it and updates wont be available. That will eventually render the app unworkable, the Justice Department has said in court filings.\n\nThe decision came against the backdrop of unusual political agitation by President-elect Donald Trump, who vowed that he could negotiate a solution, and the administration of President Joe Biden, which has signaled it wont enforce the law  which was passed with overwhelming bipartisan support  beginning Sunday, his final full day in office.\n\nTikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement, noting that actions to implement the law will fall to the new administration.\n\nTrump, mindful of TikToks popularity, and his own 14.7 million followers on the app, finds himself on the opposite side of the argument from prominent Senate Republicans who fault TikToks Chinese owner for not finding a buyer before now. Trump said in a Truth Social post shortly before the decision was issued that TikTok was among the topics in his conversation Friday with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who is expected to attend Trumps inauguration, used the app to thank the incoming president for his commitment to work with us to keep TikTok available.\n\nIts unclear what options are open to Trump, a Republican, once he is sworn in as president on Monday. The law allowed for a 90-day pause in the restrictions on the app if there had been progress toward a sale before it took effect. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who defended the law at the Supreme Court for the Democratic Biden administration, told the justices last week that its uncertain whether the prospect of a sale once the law is in effect could trigger a 90-day respite for TikTok.\n\nThe decision explores the intersection of the First Amendment and national security concerns in the fast-changing realm of social media, and the justices acknowledged in their opinion that the new terrain has been difficult to navigate given they know relatively little about it.\n\nCongress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikToks data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary, the court said in an unsigned opinion, adding that the law does not violate petitioners First Amendment rights.\n\nJustices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch filed short separate opinions noting some reservations about the courts decision but going along with the outcome.\n\nWithout doubt, the remedy Congress and the President chose here is dramatic, Gorsuch wrote. Still, he said he was persuaded by the argument that China could get access to vast troves of personal information about tens of millions of Americans.\n\nSome digital rights groups slammed the courts ruling shortly after it was released.\n\nTodays unprecedented decision upholding the TikTok ban harms the free expression of hundreds of millions of TikTok users in this country and around the world, said Kate Ruane, a director at the Washington-based Center for Democracy & Technology, which has supported TikToks challenge to the federal law.\n\nContent creators who opposed the law also worried about the effect on their business if TikTok shuts down.\n\nIm very, very concerned about whats going to happen over the next couple weeks, said Desiree Hill, owner of Crowns Corner mechanic shop in Conyers, Georgia. And very scared about the decrease that Im going to have in reaching customers and worried Im going to potentially lose my business in the next six months.\n\nAt arguments, the justices were told by a lawyer for TikTok and ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese technology company that is its parent, how difficult it would be to consummate a deal, especially since Chinese law restricts the sale of the proprietary algorithm that has made the social media platform wildly successful.\n\nThe app allows users to watch hundreds of videos in about half an hour because some are only a few seconds long, according to a lawsuit filed last year by Kentucky complaining that TikTok is designed to be addictive and harms kids mental health. Similar suits were filed by more than a dozen states. TikTok has called the claims inaccurate.\n\nThe dispute over TikToks ties to China has come to embody the geopolitical competition between Washington and Beijing.\n\nByteDance and its Chinese Communist masters had nine months to sell TikTok before the Sunday deadline, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X. The very fact that Communist China refuses to permit its sale reveals exactly what TikTok is: a communist spy app. The Supreme Court correctly rejected TikToks lies and propaganda masquerading as legal arguments.\n\nThe U.S. has said its concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way thats difficult to detect.\n\nTikTok points out the U.S. has not presented evidence that China has attempted to manipulate content on its U.S. platform or gather American user data through TikTok.\n\nBiden signed the legislation it into law in April. The law was the culmination of a yearslong saga in Washington over TikTok, which the government sees as a national security threat.\n\nTikTok, which sued the government last year over the law, has long denied it could be used as a tool of Beijing. A three-judge panel made up of two Republican appointees and a Democratic appointee unanimously upheld the law in December, prompting TikToks quick appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nWithout a sale to an approved buyer, the law bars app stores operated by Apple, Google and others from offering TikTok beginning on Sunday. Internet hosting services also will be prohibited from hosting TikTok.\n\nByteDance has said it wont sell. But some investors have been eyeing it, including Trumps former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt. McCourts Project Liberty initiative has said it and its unnamed partners have presented a proposal to ByteDance to acquire TikToks U.S. assets. The consortium, which includes Shark Tank host Kevin OLeary, did not disclose the financial terms of the offer.\n\nMcCourt, in a statement following the ruling, said his group was ready to work with the company and President Trump to complete a deal.Prelogar told the justices last week that having the law take effect might be just the jolt ByteDance needs to reconsider its position.\n\n",

The heavy rainfall has resulted in the water flow overloading existing drainage structures.\n\nAreas that have been adversely affected include the Rutenga-Mbizi section where 360 metres of tracks were washed away and also a section along the Rutenga-Beitbridge line where 120 metres of tracks were washed away, with gullies reaching two metres in some areas, NRZ said.\n\nIt noted that the area experienced wash aways but due to climate change, high rainfall has since made the unexpected severe damage to the rails.\n\nThe area is susceptible to such incidents because of its natural topographic formation. Although we have previously had similar experiences in the same corridor over the past few years, including on the Mozambican side, this has been worse than any wash away we have seen before.\n\nThe NRZ confirmed that there were dispatched wagons carrying ballast and quarry fines from the Nalatale Quarry Mine in Shangani en route to the affected areas.\n\nFortunately, there have been no injuries reported among staff or damage to rolling stock due to the washouts.\n\n",
