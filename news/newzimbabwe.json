We have enjoyed such good hospitality even after the accident. We value this, said a tourist after arriving in Victoria Falls.\n\nAlthough no fatalities were recorded, eight people, seven of them foreigners, were admitted in Gwanda and Bulawayo.\n\nAbsence of the train, whose repair was said to be on course, meant tourists had to continue using other means to Victoria Falls, with the road being governments initial plan.\n\nTourism Minister Barbara Rwodzi and Bulawayo Minister of State Judith Ncube both rushed to visit the injured tourists at Roman Catholic run private hospital Mater Dei in Bulawayo and Gwanda.\n\nThe two also toured the accident scene.\n\nGovernment, which has constantly been accused of ignoring the road, has reportedly engaged eight contractors to work on the 435km highway.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nHIGH Court judge Justice Esther Muremba has finally released her detailed judgement in the case of a Chinese national jailed 30 years for killing a miner in Zhombe and also for attempted murder and assault.\n\nCai Yulong was slapped with a 20-year jail term in September last year, but the judge issued an extempore ruling.\n\nYulong, the owner of Stone Steel Mine also known as Blue Mine in Zhombe, fatally shot Goni Goni after accusing him and his colleagues of encroaching into his mine on May 24 last year.\n\nHe also attempted to kill John Muchawaya Bera by shooting him once on the right knee and once on the left thigh, before he unlawfully struck Lovemore Mapfanya with a clenched fist.\n\nHe was convicted on all counts.\n\nYulong, who was in the country on a Temporary Work Permit, had pleaded not guilty to all the charges.\n\nIn his defence, the accused did not dispute shooting the deceased in the murder charge and the complainant in the attempted murder charge.\n\nHe claimed that his actions were in self-defence and in defence of his property.\n\nRegarding the assault charge, the accused stated that it was fabricated.\n\nHowever, the court ruled that his defence was weak.\n\nThe court heard that on the fateful day, the deceased, the complainant and their colleagues who were employed by Blackhand 10 Mine were working underground erecting the barricade.\n\nIt was heard the accused entered his mine using his shaft and proceeded to the intersection between the two mines. A confrontation ensued between the accused and the Blackhand 10 Mine workers, during which the accused shot at them.\n\nIn her ruling, Muremba said there was no justification for what Yulong did.\n\nIn this case, the offence of murder is further aggravated by the fact that the accused shot the deceased and his colleagues as they were fleeing for their lives.\n\nEven if it were accepted that the deceased and his colleagues were illegally panning for gold in the accuseds mine, the accused had no right to shoot them while they were running away.\n\nThe sanctity of human life must be upheld, and the accuseds actions demonstrate a cold-blooded killing.\n\nThe accused intentionally killed the deceased, and the deceaseds father provided a victim impact statement indicating the profound trauma caused by his sons death.\n\nThe father, who had expected his 23-year-old son to marry and provide him with grandchildren, was devastated by the unnatural and violent nature of his death, she said.\n\nThe judge also said the deceased was also the breadwinner for his family, and his loss has left them facing significant financial and emotional challenges.\n\nThe father had expressed a desire for the death penalty to be imposed, while the State has prayed for a sentence of 40 years imprisonment.\n\nIn relation to the charge of attempted murder, the accused used a firearm to shoot the complainant twice in both legs, causing serious injuries.\n\nWhen he was shooting the complainant, he was actually holding his legs to make sure that he would not escape.\n\nWhilst the doctors report states that there will not be permanent injury, we noted that the complainant was still walking with the aid of crutches when he came to court to testify, the judge said.\n\nDuring trial his right leg was still in plaster.\n\nThe complainant was shot while running away, and the victim impact statement reveals the profound pain and trauma he has endured.\n\nHe lost a workmate during the shooting and remains deeply affected by the incident. He is still nursing his injuries and is unable to provide for his family as the breadwinner.\n\nThe complainant has no hope of returning to the mining industry due to his inability to perform heavy duties, the judge noted.\n\nThe judge said the statutory penalty for attempted murder committed in aggravating circumstances is 20 years imprisonment up to death.\n\nShe said the presumptive penalty for attempted murder committed under such circumstances is five years imprisonment, but given the severity of the offence, a higher penalty is warranted.\n\nThe accused exhibited a high degree of cruelty by holding the complainant with one hand while shooting him in the back of his legs, completely disabling him from walking.\n\nThe court agrees with the States submission for a sentence of 10 years imprisonment.\n\nHowever, to avoid an excessive overall sentence, five years of this sentence will be suspended for five years on the condition that the accused does not commit an offence involving violence on the person of another during this period, she said.\n\nShe said the effective sentence for attempted murder will be five years imprisonment, which we will order to run concurrently with the sentence for murder.\n\nFor the first count Yulong was jailed 30 years.\n\nFor count two, he was jailed 10 years imprisonment of which five years imprisonment was suspended for 5 years on condition the accused does not within that period commit an offence involving violence on the person of another and for which upon conviction he is sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine.\n\nHe effectively sentenced to five years for the count.\n\nThis effective sentence of five years imprisonment will run concurrently with the sentence for murder.\n\nFor assault, Yulomg was fined US$100 in default of payment he will serve one month imprisonment.\n\n",

Matthew 25:40\n\nAs we celebrate 45 years of independence, we must remember that true freedom is not just about political liberation but also about economic empowerment. Unfortunately, many Zimbabweans are struggling to make ends meet, living on less than a dollar a day, and civil servants earn far below the poverty datum line.\n\nFor the needy will not always be forgotten, and the hope of the poor will not perish forever.  Psalm 9:18\n\nWe implore our political leadership to value the lives of the majority, to prioritize their economic well-being, and to take concrete actions to alleviate poverty. Hunger and poverty can cause disharmony in communities and harden souls.\n\nWe pray that our government authorities will take the economic situation of its citizens seriously, that they will value the lives of the poor and vulnerable, and that they will work towards creating a more just and equitable society.\n\nRighteousness exalts a nation, but sin is a reproach to any people.  Proverbs 14:34\n\nLET US PRAY:\n\nDear Lord, we come before you today, asking that you guide our leaders to prioritize the economic well-being of their citizens.\n\nMay they value the lives of the poor and vulnerable, and may they work towards creating a more just and equitable society.\n\nAs long as our people are hungry and unhappy, our country cannot enjoy true happiness. We ask that you give our leaders wisdom, compassion, and courage to take action today and the time is now.\n\nAMEN.\n\n",

We must shut down Zimbabwe completely.\n\nThis is to send a strong message to Mnangagwa and his zvigananda. Shops and industries will not open, and kombis will be parked.\n\nThe police will not teargas you, but if they ever come to you, you have the right to defend yourselves, Geza said.\n\nGeza also said Mnangagwas control over State institutions and the ban on demonstrations has made staying at home a powerful form of resistance.\n\nMnangagwa has taken control of the judiciary and shuts down Parliament at his own discretion.\n\nZimbabwe stands out as the only country where public demonstrations are effectively banned, so we have discovered that staying at home is one of the few powerful tools we still have to make our voices heard.\n\nI am pleading with you to stay home, I know it is hard considering we are leaving from hand to mouth. So fellow Zimbabweans we are staying away to force Mnangagwa to step down, added Geza.\n\nLast month, a total 98 suspects were arrested for allegedly participating in the flash March 31 protests in Harare, which were violently dispersed by police and only three have been released on bail.\n\n",

Companies were also allowed to swap their androids with substitutes when they could no longer compete, though each substitution came with a 10-minute penalty.\n\nThe first robot across the finish line, Tiangong Ultra  created by the Beijing Humanoid Robot Innovation Center  finished the route in two hours and 40 minutes. Thats nearly two hours short of the human world record of 56:42, held by Ugandan runner Jacob Kiplimo. The winner of the mens race on Saturday finished in 1 hour and 2 minutes.\n\nTang Jian, chief technology officer for the robotics innovation center, said Tiangong Ultras performance was aided by long legs and an algorithm allowing it to imitate how humans run a marathon.\n\nI dont want to boast but I think no other robotics firms in the West have matched Tiangongs sporting achievements, Tang said, according to the Reuters news agency, adding that the robot switched batteries just three times during the race.\n\nThe 1.8-meter robot came across a few challenges during the race, which involved the multiple battery changes. It also needed a helper to run alongside it with his hands hovering around his back, in case of a fall.\n\nMost of the robots required this kind of support, with a few tied to a leash. Some were led by a remote control.\n\nAmateur human contestants running in the other lane had no difficulty keeping up, with the curious among them taking out their phones to capture the robotic encounters as they raced along.\n\n",

She resisted and tried to loosen his grip, but she failed.\n\nThe offender continued to drag the victim deeper into the bush whilst holding her dress.\n\nThe victim cried for help, but no one heard her, that was when the offender threatened to kill her with a silver knife that he took from his bag, ordering her to be quiet. He forced her to the ground, held her down, removed her pants, and raped her, the State proved.\n\nAfter the rape, he threatened to kill her if she told anyone.\n\nThe victim disclosed the assault to her aunt in December 2024 before the matter was reported.\n\n",
