            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nEVEN though public health facilities continue providing HIV and AIDS medication with more players tackling the endemic, dealing with the condition, sexual reproductive health and rights (SRHR) issues, focus on the subject seems to be taking a dead seat, an activist has said.\n\nMartha Todhlana told media health practitioners during a Media and Science Cafe Programme in Harare recently that it was sad to note HIV counselling issues had declined with a lot of people now out of support programmes and no longer getting some health services such as health checks and or monitoring.\n\nOnce the universal programme started to say anyone who tests can just test and treat, I think issues of counselling have declined and also people not seeing the need for being in support groups.\n\nYou will find that currently, a lot of people who are in support groups now are those who tested some years back, before we had the programme as it is, but those who started treatment in the test and treat programme, a lot of them are not in support groups because they dont see the need.\n\nI think a positive is that public health facilities continue providing HIV medication and there are more players tackling HIV, tackling sexual and reproductive health and rights, SRHR, but sadly I think focus on HIV seems to be taking a dead seat, Todhlana said.\n\nAll this, according to her, has been attributed to several reasons amongst them a weak psycho-social support system, a shift in funding which is now more focused on young people and to a certain extent, the emergence of non-communicable diseases that are on the increase.\n\nMany people with HIV are struggling with non-communicable diseases, which are not properly managed, and some non-communicable diseases come with extreme pain. Those sharing their experiences indicate that the pain management approach is almost close to none.\n\nI think this is linked to funding and there is a focus on young people, which is good, especially adolescent girls and young women.\n\nWe have seen an improvement on the PrEP issues, but the realities that we consider as we get into 2025 include sadly that HIV stigma and discrimination persists, the level of domestic funding for health and particularly HIV is worryingly too low, Todhlana, who tested HIV positive in 2003 added.\n\nShe explained further: And the continued focus on young people or the 0-49 age group ignores the effect of HIV successes, which means people are ageing with HIV.\n\nBecause when we celebrate the success, by the way I turned 16 last week and Im already out of the 0-49 age group and I get my treatment from the public health sector and it is very obvious that you are autistic outside, but I see so many people who are even older than me, living with HIV and getting their treatment and then you are left to your own individual and without the proper care and support.\n\nI think the HIV facility used to be linked to a robust psycho-social support system, but a lot of times I see that this is no longer available and also it was still for people who are more than 49.\n\nAccording to Todhlana, her worry is the upkeep of the young adults born with HIV.\n\nI keep worrying about who is looking after them and the language we still use around young people is being reckless. We say Im a 2,000 reckless, but we call, and they are putting themselves in situations where they can get HIV. They are putting themselves at risk, but we forget that there is that cohort of young people who were not reckless.\n\nShe said many of those who were born with HIV or might have got it from breast milk before we know what we know now are quite a big number in our population who are in this cohort.\n\nSo, when I talk of people ageing with HIV, I include these young people. And then people diagnosed in their adulthood, like me, we have more than 20 years of treatment and Im increasing in number.\n\nTodhlana spoke of ART side effects saying a lot of lives were being lost because of less attention and monitoring to those taking ARVs.\n\nOn the packaging of the ARVs, the side effects are written, they are very clearly written there to say your kidneys will be affected, your liver will be affected, you know, a whole lot of organs will be affected so they need to be monitored regularly.\n\nBut I, I think the reason they are not being monitored is because when they were doing the monitoring there was external funding to do that and once the external fund has left, then it is no longer there because our labs are no longer eternally being funded.\n\nShe also raised issues to do with menopause and social isolation issues to those living with HIV.\n\nMenopause is coming much earlier for women with HIV than for those who do not have HIV. Maybe 10 years or so earlier.\n\nAnd then also the social isolation at times. With social isolation, I havent been to church for three years now. Im someone who enjoys going for Sunday services and going for midweek services. I havent been inside a church for the past three years.\n\nI was diagnosed of HIV in 2000, then diagnosis of arthritis in my spine in 2008, that was five years after starting ARVs in 2003. But the ARVs we were taking, were too many, at least three tablets three times a day, compared to one tablet once a day. You see how our researchers continue to improve. Today we have progressed to one tablet every 24 hours.\n\nShe stated that research studies are very important.\n\nClinical research and social research have been very important to the response to HIV. And also Im hoping to see that theres also media doing their research as well, as media, to make sure that they contribute to the body of knowledge that is building on our HIV response, she explained.\n\nTodhlana has a daughter, now at university, born without HIV to a mother living with HIV.\n\nShe gave credit to GALZ for the support given during her most difficult time of life.\n\n",

            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nFORMER Harare mayor, Bernard Manyenyeni has trashed the capitals attempts at achieving world class city status, saying it is a pipe dream which should just be buried.\n\nManyenyeni, who was in office from 2013 to 2018, said until conditions that allowed Harare to be run like a normal metropolis were restored, the local authoritys dream would never come true.\n\nCity of Harare (CoH) had been targeting to have turned the capital into a world class city by 2025, a target it missed dismally.\n\nAttempts by Harare Mayor Jacob Mafume to sell the idea of it having taken steps towards achieving this target have been dismissed.\n\nAccess to basic provisions such as clean potable water remain a challenge for most of the overpopulated citys residents, sewer, dirt, potholes, and general lack of effort have troubled the capitals governance.\n\nFinally, the dream dies, 2025 is here today. I shed no tears, said Manyenyeni.\n\nFormer Harare mayor, Bernard Manyenyeni\n\nI disowned this misplaced mantra some years ago when I was still leading this council.\n\nAs usual, there was a sustained attempt to carry the empty noises onto as late as last night (31 December).\n\nManyenyeni did not wholly heap the blame on council, but he raised issues with laws which govern councils, central government interference, a lack of infrastructure and questioned the readiness of residents and ratepayers to embrace change.\n\nThe mess, he said, must be blamed on a 2013 directive by the Local Government ministry to pardon debts amounting to US$300 million, owed to council.\n\nAnother directive to award bosses at local authorities hefty allowances was also fingered as another reason for the financial woes facing CoH.\n\nBoth affected his tenure, he alleged.\n\nThe ex-premier highlighted that had those directives not been issued, at least US$2 billion would have been realised by council.\n\nAdded Manyenyeni: This was close to 30 months revenues  with zero compensation from the government.\n\nHCC has not yet recovered from both the direct and indirect pains of those ministerial signatures.\n\nMy own estimate is that the indirect costs of just those two directives add another US$2 billion minimum hemorrhage to Harare City Council.\n\nUntil there is convergence of power with willpower in what must be done, there is no room for positive dreams for the city.\n\nNightmares will be the order of the broad day. Until the key ingredients of running even a normal city are restored, forget about a world-class city.\n\nManyenyeni further poked holes into the dream by questioning the manner of governance at Town House where top officials continue facing arrests on spurious allegations of corruption, abuse of office and various other crimes.\n\nHe mocked it, saying CoH could just be targeting a world record.\n\nMunicipalities draw a lot of support from the goodwill they carry, he said.\n\nHCC has a poor record, world record loading. Among other sore red flags, you cannot imagine any capital city whose Mayors and Town Clerks have been arrested in office more than the Zimbabwe capital in the last 20 years.\n\nIn our media age, how many negative stories pop up when anything about Harare City Council is searched on the web? How many good ones?\n\nLet the dead dream be buriedI shed no tears.\n\n",

Deputy Police Commissioner-General, Stephen Mutamba, was elevated to take over reins at Police General Headquarters (PGHQ).\n\nAn organisation claiming to represent children of war veterans has made sensational allegations that Matanga reported at his Harare offices and defended his move saying he was yet to receive official communication of his marching orders.\n\nMatanga reported to his office today in full police uniform. His argument is that he was not served with a letter of dismissal, he only saw the letter on social media, said COZWA.\n\nCOZWA proceeded to make sensational claims that the polices Support Unit, Alpha Troop had been put on standby to forcibly remove him from office.\n\nNational police spokesperson, Commissioner Paul Nyathi was not picking calls when NewZimbabwe.com reached out to him inorder to shed light on the matter.\n\nHowever, an invitation from Nyathis office calling on journalists to attend a handover-and-takeover ceremony on January 3, 2025, circulated Thursday, seemingly conveniently timed to diffuse reports of the unfolding drama at PGHQ. The historic event will take place at Mukushi Depot, formerly Morris Depot this Friday.\n\nMatanga took over from Augustine Chihuri, who fled the country after the November 2017 coup that toppled late President Robert Mugabe before President Emmerson Mnangagwa assumed office.\n\nChihuri was perceived to have been a member of Zanu PFs losing G40 faction whose members also fled and are now scattered across the region.\n\n",

We need to produce more power to meet our energy needs, said Chombo.\n\nThere is still scope for more projects to ensure Zimbabwe has adequate energy for domestic consumption and surplus for export. We are particularly impressed by the solar power plant in our province.\n\nThe expansion of the solar farm and its associated transmission facilities followed an impact investment strategy of Old Mutual Limited and NSSA that was announced in December 2021.\n\nThe power plant is located at the 35km mark along the Harare-Chirundu highway, and it is now feeding into the grid, thanks to local pension fund, NSSA, as well as the investment arms of Old Mutual for helping make the project a reality. It is now the second largest utility-scale plant in Zimbabwe.\n\nCentragrid plant manager, Engineer Tariro Muka said the power from the solar panels feeds into the national grid through the 88KV Norton to Mazowe powerline, reiterating the need to embrace clean energy.\n\nConsidering issues of global warming and climate change, it is important for us to go green. That will be a significant step in reducing global warming, said Muka.\n\nEnergy expert, Munashe Ngwerume told NewZimbabwe.com that locally-funded solar power plants could help alleviate the countrys electricity generation shortfall in a short space of time.\n\nSolar plants of this size can be built fairly quickly and can be up and running in under a year. The biggest challenge experienced by independent power producers in Zimbabwe is lack of funding.\n\nWith foreign funding having proven to be difficult to secure for most developers for over a decade due to several factors, including the countrys high risk profile, a locally-funded model based on the learnings from Centragrids first 25MW plant as well as the government putting its own resources into the mix as it did with the accelerated road rehabilitation project, could change the game for local IPPs, said Ngwerume.\n\nAt current pricing, Ngwerume emphasised, going solar is attractive right now due to the incredible reduction in the price of solar panels.\n\nA 25MWp solar PV plant can now probably be constructed for about $20 million in this part of the world at current prices.\n\nThis cost includes all the development, permitting, and construction costs up to the Commercial Operation Date (COD)Zimbabwe has 10 provinces, they could even build one plant in each province for easier integration into the grid and also spread the solar love around the country equitably.\n\nAdding four of these 25MW plants to each province would get 1GWp of good installed nameplate solar capacity in a very short time.\n\nNgwerume said Zimbabwe needs cheaper, faster-to-build electricity generation plants hence the Centragrid solar PV project aligns with governments efforts in scaling up renewable energy capacity\n\nGovernment has targeted to generate 16.5% of total electricity or 1,100 MW from renewables by 2025, and 26.5 % of total generation or 2,100 MW from renewables by 2030.\n\nThe investment comes at a time when Zimbabwe faces a power deficit of around 600 MW to 700 MW, according to energy estimates by authorities. This deficit is due to severe climate changes that lowered the dam levels at the countrys largest electricity generation station, the Kariba South Hydro Power Plant.\n\nCentragrid founder and managing director, Victor Utedzi was recently quoted in the media expressing pride in the project, highlighting the importance of local investment in driving Africas energy future.\n\nThis flagship project stands as a testament to what can be accomplished by local investors in Africa in the pursuit of alleviating energy shortages, Utedzi said.\n\nThe Nyabira solar plant is one of the first IPPs to connect to Zimbabwes national grid, and its expansion further cements its role as a key player in the countrys renewable energy landscape. The increased capacity will contribute to the national grid, offering much-needed relief to Zimbabwes energy supply challenges.\n\nThe success of this project is seen as a model for other renewable energy initiatives across the country, with hopes that more locally funded projects will follow suit to reduce dependency on external capital and improve energy security.\n\nUtedzi said the project was critical to Zimbabwes intention to add about 4 000 MW of electricity by 2030, given the growing demand for electricity.\n\nHe acknowledged there is a lot of demand for electricity in new industries coming up, taking advantage of favourable investment conditions created by President Emmerson Mnangagwas government.\n\nMining, agricultural, manufacturing and tourism sectors are growing significantly and demand more electricity.\n\nSo, we need to add more electricity to this country and Centragrid is that first step of the large-scale renewable energy projects that are adding to electricity generation in Zimbabwe, said Utedzi.\n\nLiu Yachen, the Sinohydro project manager for the solar project said at the peak of the project, employed about 400 locals and about 10 Chinese experts.\n\n",
