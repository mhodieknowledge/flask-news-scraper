            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner atMadzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. This week we want to discuss the law of succession as it relates to agricultural land in Zimbabwe. What are the main considerations?\n\nVM:Thank you\n\nBefore delving into the laws of succession in agricultural land, it is necessary that I first address how agricultural is held in Zimbabwe. Agricultural land is held either through title deeds, 99-year leases, leases with an option to purchase, offer letters, permits or customarily as rural land under Rural District Councils.\n\nThese forms of holding confer personal rights to the holder except in title deeds, where the holder has real rights to the land. The personal rights titles emanating from Land Reform, being mainly permits, offer letters and 99-year leases, are a result of potentially one of the most significant wealth transfer events in post-colonial Africa.\n\nThe land itself is owned by the state and occupiers have usufructs on the land to use, enjoy and earn from it.\n\nThis background or understanding is necessary as it has a direct effect on succession.\n\nSuccession itself has become topical as farming by its very nature is a generational business.\n\nIf land reform started around 2000, it means the process is now 25 years old and cases of succession by heirs are now commonplace.\n\nReporter: You highlight land reform beneficiaries, that is A1 and A2. What is the process when the initial beneficiary dies?\n\nVM:It is important that we first differentiate the A1, being a small holder farm held under a permit from the government and an A2 farm being a large-scale commercial farm held under an offer letter or a 99-year lease.\n\nI understand that the current government policy is aimed at issuing deeds for these holders. I will discuss on succession for deeds later on. For now, I will restrict myself to permit, offer letter and lease holders.\n\nFirst thing to understand is that the land under these models belongs to the State and not individuals, therefore, succession in its strictest sense, which is through the Master of the High Court, is only for improvements and movable property.\n\nIf its for land, then the succession or reallocation of land to an heir has to be approved by the government who is the landowner. When the estate of the late holder is being administered, the value of the land is not included in the process as it does not belong to the estate but the government.\n\nMaking the process twotier\n\nFor A1 farms, the surviving spouse and dependants may succeed although the successor has to be approved by the Minister of Lands. The process is done through the District Lands office within 3  6 months after the death of the land owner, depending on whether or not there are disputes. In situations of disputes, spousal rights are protected and consideration is also given to potential successors who developed the farm.\n\nThe process is similar for A2 offer letters; there is a need for an application to the Ministry of Lands district office with the required documents, which is dealt with by the Valuation and Estate Management section. As part of its consideration, it will assess, among other things, the capacity to farm, whether or not the potential heir has other farms et cetera.\n\nAs for lease holders, it is governed by general inheritance laws; the executor, upon completing the beneficiary identification process, will still be required to make an application to the Minister for approval of allocation.\n\nReporter:What issues may inhibit or stop the A1 or A2 farms being re-allocated or distributed to the selected beneficiary?\n\nVM:I am forced to start by reiterating that the rights conferred by offer letters and or leases are personal in nature. This makes it necessary for the beneficiary or potential heir to prove the rights to the Ministry of Lands.\n\nSuch proof is through the offer letter, permit or lease granted to the deceased. A failure to prove implies that the late occupier may potentially have been an unlawful occupier.\n\nIn the absence of proof, the Ministry of Lands has no obligation to re-allocate the land to the selected heir. As there may be back and forth between the offices, it is important that copies of correspondence with the Ministry are kept judiciously in the event there is a need for them to be reproduced\n\nReporter: What is the inheritance position for rural kumusha land when it comes to inheritance and farms having a title deed?\n\nVM:Communal land is vested in the President and administered by the Rural district Councils through traditional leaders being chiefs and headmen. Their inheritance for use is normally through family lines.\n\nAs for farms having title deeds, they fall under our normal inheritance laws under the purview of the Master of the High Court. The Ministry of Lands does not have jurisdiction over these types of farms.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

            "content": "By Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThis story was originally published byGlobal Press Journal.\n\nNational laws aimed at redressing colonial imbalances reserve retail sectors, like that of brickmaking, for locals. But companies with outside investment, particularly from China, routinely flout the rules.\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  For nearly a decade, Stanley has made a living laying out bricks for drying at Willdale Bricks, one of Zimbabwes oldest brick manufacturers. That work paid his rent and kept his three children in school. But orders at the company have slowed and, like many other colleagues, he hasnt seen a salary in two months.\n\nWe used to be self-sufficient through our salaries, says Stanley, who asked to use his middle name for fear of losing his job. That stability is gone.\n\nCompanies in Zimbabwes brickmaking sector are feeling the pressure from growing competition by foreign-backed companies expanding into the retail end of the industry.\n\nBy law, this shouldnt be happening. The countrys Indigenization and Economic Empowerment Act reserves the retail sector and others  including wholesale trade, employment agencies and advertising  for its citizens. Foreign nationals require permission from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to operate in these sectors.\n\nThe law, passed in 2007, is among policies pursued by the former President Robert Mugabes government to redress colonial imbalances that excluded Zimbabwes black majority from owning or meaningfully participating in key sectors of the economy.\n\nBut like the land reforms, which also meant to address these imbalances, the policy has long been controversial. Some say it has mostly created regulatory uncertainty, benefited those with close links to the state, and driven away much-needed foreign direct investment, among other concerns.\n\nSince its introduction, the policy has undergone some changes under President Emmerson Mnangagwas administration to open up the economy for more investment. Through a 2018 Finance Act, the government revised the language and reserved these sectors to Zimbabwean citizens rather than indigenous Zimbabweans as the original policy stated. It also limited a 51% local ownership requirement to businesses that extract diamonds and platinum.\n\nCritics say while well-intentioned, the policy is inconsistently applied. Some foreign firms sidestep the requirements with relative ease.\n\nIn the brickmaking sector, companies like Willdale Bricks  which once dominated the industry and employs hundreds  are being edged out by foreign-backed manufacturers that are extending into retail.\n\nGlobal Press Journal directly contacted several companies registered with Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency as brick manufacturers  including Tiger Bricks, Preedon Bricks and Obrim Bricks  all registered as foreign investments. Each confirmed they sell directly to customers.\n\nWhen asked if the companies had the permission required, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce did not respond. Global Press Journal also requested information on special licenses issued in recent years but did not get any response by the time of publication.\n\nHowever, an official in the department of economic empowerment at the ministry familiar with the matter, who did not want to be named for fear of losing his job, says that since he joined the ministry in 2019 it has not allowed any foreign companies to sell bricks. If [foreign] companies are selling bricks either through retail or wholesale without such permission, its unlawful, he says.\n\nSuch licenses usually last five years, he says, and if there are any companies that had these licenses before his arrival at the ministry, they would have lapsed by now.\n\nEven if they have licenses, its still a problem, says Godfrey Kanyenze, founding director of the Labour and Economic Development Research Institute of Zimbabwe. Brickmaking, he says, is one of the clear areas that should be reserved for locals.\n\nThere is no real point in having people come from far away to do what locals can do. Brickmaking is not a complicated economic activity that should require foreign direct investment, Kanyenze says, adding that the country should seek foreign investment in more complex capital- and skill-intensive areas.Our locals, even in the villages, make bricks.\n\nBricks move along the production line at Obrim Bricks. Despite laws reserving the retail sector for citizens, foreign companies continue to sell directly to customers, raising concerns among local producers. Photo: Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThe indigenization policy is increasingly tested as Zimbabwe, like many other countries in Africa, embraces Chinese investment. In 2023, the government issued about 369 new licenses to Chinese investors, accounting for 60% of all foreign investment that year and representing about 154% more investors than 2022.\n\nWhile the capital that comes from foreign direct investment can be beneficial to the country, the cost is steep. Its a double-edged sword, says Joe Muzurura, a political analyst who has written extensively about this issue in Zimbabwe. Its eroding local industries, he says, citing the example of Willdale Bricks, which is no longer the giant it used to be.\n\nIf well regulated, foreign direct investment could support local players and help grow domestic industry, Muzurura says. Instead, he says, its stifling [them].\n\nAlready, local brick companies are under strain from the countrys worsening economic conditions. Willdale Bricks 2024 annual report shows that the company was struggling with liquidity constraints and high production costs. And a 15% value-added tax introduced in 2024 on the supply of bricks has pushed customers to cheaper, often non-compliant alternatives.\n\nBeta Bricks, also a local brick manufacturing company and part of the Beta Holdings group, entered corporate rescue proceedings in January after defaulting on loans.\n\nBoth companies did not respond to Global Press Journal requests for interviews.\n\nObrim Brick Manufacturers is an investment company registered as a manufacturer and majority-owned by Chinese shareholders. Anesu Kondo, an accountant at Obrim, says their operations are fully compliant.\n\nWhile Kondo says they do not have a special license from the ministry that would allow them to operate in retail, he says selling their product directly to customers should not be mistaken as retail trade. We are not acting as middlemen. We are selling what we produce, he says.\n\nForeign companies are only filling a gap left by struggling local companies, Kondo adds. When we entered the market, the major players werent meeting demand. Local companies werent recapitalizing, and many still rely on outdated brickmaking technologies.\n\nSuch interpretation is simply stretching the law, says Nyasha Brighton Munyuru, a managing partner at Muvingi and Mugadza Legal Practitioners, adding that the law is clear: Such a company needs permission from the ministry to operate in retail.\n\nWorkers stack bricks for delivery at Obrim Bricks. Analysts warn that foreign-backed firms with greater production capacity are edging out Zimbabwean companies already struggling with rising costs and economic instability. Photo: Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThe government has failed to implement the law, says Henry, a senior employee at Willdale Bricks who has worked at the company for nearly 25 years. He requested the use of his first name only, for fear of losing his job.\n\nBefore a foreign business sets up its operations, there should be strict rules in place and enforcement to match. But that rarely happens, he says, adding that some foreign companies operating in the country arent formally registered with authorities.\n\nGenerally, there is a double standard in how authorities implement regulations, he says. They allow foreign investors to evade taxes and regulations, while local businesses face intense scrutiny. Were expected to comply fully, bank all our earnings, and accept local currency that constantly loses value, he says.\n\nForeign companies bypass the requirements that weigh down local producers, making it hard for locals to compete, Stanley says.\n\nOn top of that, the foreign companies have the added advantage of superior technology and greater production capacity, says Muzurura, the analyst.\n\nZimbabwe isnt the only one grappling with the ripple effects of foreign investment on local businesses.\n\nIn Zambia, Chinese-owned enterprises dominate sectors such as mining and retail, often undercutting local entrepreneurs with lower prices, according to 2018 research by the International Institute for Environment and Development.\n\nIn Sri Lanka, according to a 2023 report by the International Collective in Support for Fishworkers, the Hambantota Port project, largely funded by Chinese investment, has strained local livelihoods. The projects large-scale fishing operations have encroached on traditional fishing grounds, making access difficult for local fishermen.\n\nAnd in Vietnam, while Chinese manufacturing companies in the textiles and electronics sectors have created jobs, they also have displaced small Vietnamese producers who struggle to compete with the Chinese firms lower prices and greater production capabilities, according to a 2017 report from the Harbin Engineering Universitys School of Economics and Management.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, this shift happens at a time when the economy is fragile and unemployment is high  a dangerous mix.\n\nAs their salaries havent been guaranteed, both Stanley and Henry have had to find other means to subsist.\n\nHenry takes on side jobs to make ends meet.\n\nIn the past, working at Willdale was something to be proud of. Now, even informal vendors seem better off, Henry says. We are in a dire state.\n\nLinda Mujuruis a Global Press Journal reporter-in-residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.\n\nGlobal Press Journal delivers bold, investigative and in-depth explanatory reporting on the worlds most urgent issues.\n\n",
