Businesses are moving away from traffic congestion, parking space shortages and unsatisfactory building conditions, such as malfunctioning elevators and air-conditioning systems in the CBD, he said.\n\nMoyo said recent local plans, such as the Avondale and E.D. Mnangagwa Road Local Development Plans, have also influenced demand as they permit mixed-use developments along major arterial roads.\n\nDuring the period, the Groups Net Property Income increased by 62% to US$4,842,676, while revenue was up 31% to US$9,027,117 as rental income remained the main source of revenue.\n\nRevenue growth was driven by growth in property services income, predominantly project management fees, an upsurge in pure US dollar rentals, and timely rental reviews.\n\nDue to tenants financial challenges, rental collection rates fell from 85% in 2023 to 75% in 2024. Management is working closely with tenants to resolve the arrears.\n\nManagement will continue to adapt its strategies to protect shareholder value and sustain business operations. Prudent capital management, stakeholder engagement, effective utilisation of the available lettable space (occupancy levels), quality and ambience of our property portfolio will be prioritized, added Moyo.\n\n",

Section 61 does not in any way exonerate the accused in court. There are limitations on section 61, and nothing was said on the limitations.\n\nTransmission of data messages of incitement does not in any way favour him in light of the limitations in section 61, Chirenje said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Daniel Itai | Connecting Africa\n\nIn recent years Zimbabwe has been implementing more agritech solutions and climate-smart technologies to counter challenges impacting the agricultural sector.\n\nIn November 2021, Zimbabwe launched theNational AgriTech Strategy 2021-2025aimed at digitalizing the farming ecosystem and improving evidence-based decision making for African farmers.\n\nAccording to Farmonaut, a satellite-based crop health monitoring startup, solar-powered irrigation systems haveboosted crop yields by 30%in Zimbabwe.\n\nWithin the last decade, the Southern African country has experienced four drought seasons resulting in erratic crop outputs and the death of livestock, making the adoption of smart agriculture solutions a necessity.\n\nAlthough the government has made calls for the adoption of smart agriculture, access to it and the know-how is still limited to a few farmers who are mainly into commercial farming due to the high cost of acquiring equipment such as drones, solar panels and lithium batteries.\n\nOver the past two decades, the country has been battered with constant power cuts, which have inadvertently led to irregular water supplies affecting communal and commercial farmers.\n\nIn 2020 the government also launched the Intwasa/Pfumvudza program, a climate-smart agriculture model designed to help smallholder farmers improve crop productivity under adverse weather conditions. As a result, the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development has been training farmers to use and implement drone technology in farming, which enables precision agriculture, feed surveillance, field mapping and chemigation.\n\nIn 2023, the government gave the green light to the use of climate-smart seeds such as maize, sorghum, millets, rice, soyabeans, sunflowers and cotton, which adapt to changing climatic conditions.\n\nSpeaking to Connecting Africa, Blessing Phiri, co-founder of agritech company Agriacres, said Zimbabwe has been shifting to renewable energy, solar boreholes, off-grid storage and precision farming.\n\nTo date, several farmers are now using mobile apps, USSD platforms, drones and satellite imaging whilst others have started implementing the central node system or IoT [Internet of Things] sensors and already some have started to yield results especially those engaging in outsourcing precision services, Phiri said.\n\nIn addition, Olga Nhari founder and national coordinator of Women in Agriculture Union (WAU), said the adoption of smart agriculture in Zimbabwe was a significant milestone, especially for female farmers.\n\nWomen farmers are increasingly using mobile apps, precision farming tools, and climate-smart agriculture technologies to enhance their productivity and decision-making. These tools help them monitor crop health, optimize water usage, and predict weather patterns, ultimately improving their yields and livelihoods, Nhari said.\n\nNhari further highlighted that agritech was playing a pivotal role in helping women farmers adapt to climate-related challenges through the aid of weather forecasting systems, soil moisture sensors, and crop monitoring platforms.\n\nSince Zimbabwe got its independence in 1980, there have been variouscontestationson whether Zimbabwe has ever truly been the breadbasket of Africa, a title thegovernment wants to reclaim.\n\nUntil 2001, Zimbabwe had been assigned the responsibility of crop production, food, agriculture and natural resources within the Southern African Development Community (SADC).\n\nIn 2022, the country recorded its highest output of maize, the countrys staple food, securing2.28 million tonsof maize.\n\nZimbabwe requires 2.2 million tons of maize annually, with 1.8 million tons for human consumption and 400,000 tons for livestock feed. This year, the country is targeting an output of 2.7 million tons of maize.\n\nNational Council of Chiefs President Chief Mtshane Khumalo told the Herald Online that communities that planted early this year under the Intwasa/Pfumvudza programare expecting a bumper harvest.\n\nThe Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development is targeting aUS$3.4 billionlivestock sector by end of 2025. It aims to double the national herd, which currently stands at 5.7 million, to 11 million by 2030 through the development of drought-tolerant livestock breeds courtesy of climate-smart breeding strategies.\n\nIn an interview with Connecting Africa, Wendy Zvakawapano, co-founder of Wenashe Farms  a regenerative and climate-smart agribusiness  said Zimbabwes agricultural sector is increasingly embracing technology-driven solutions to improve productivity, adapt to climate change, and work around challenges like power cuts and erratic rainfall.\n\nOur hydroponics units allow us to produce up to three to four times more yield per square meter than traditional soil farming, using 90% less water. In addition, integrating biogas systems has cut our energy costs, not only for our farming operations, but for our employees as well, Zvakawapano said.\n\nOverall, technology adoption has not only increased output, but also reduced input costs, minimized post-harvest losses, and improved climate resilience, especially among forward-thinking agripreneurs and cooperatives.\n\nClive Munakandafa, vice-chairperson of Zimbabwe Commercial Farmers Union for Matabeleland North, said given the countrys increasing exposure to extreme weather patterns, technology plays a crucial role in sustaining the agricultural sectors productivity.\n\nUsing these smartphone applications, sensors, drones, smart irrigation techniques and equipment, farmers are then able to plan their water application schedules based on weather forecasts and adapt as required by the prevailing situations, Munakandafa told Connecting Africa.\n\nAll these advancements have been designed to revolutionize the sector and ensure better yields and harvests under the ever-changing climatic conditions.\n\n",
