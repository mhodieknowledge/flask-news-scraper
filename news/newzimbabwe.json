            "content": "By Reuters\n\nTANZANIAS main opposition party said on Friday hundreds of people had been killed in protests over elections this week, as the U.N. secretary-general called for an investigation into allegations of excessive use of force.\n\nThe U.N. human rights office said credible reports indicated at least 10 people were killed in protests in three cities, the first public estimate of any fatalities by an international body since Wednesdays vote.The foreign ministers of Britain, Canada and Norway issued a joint statement expressing concern over the situation and urging the Tanzanian authorities to act with maximum restraint and to respect the right of assembly and of free expression.Speaking to Reuters in some of the governments first public comments on the unrest, Foreign Affairs Minister Mahmoud Thabit Kombo said the oppositions death toll was hugely exaggerated but that the authorities had not yet tabulated casualties. He denied that security officers had used excessive force.Reuters could not independently verify the casualty figures.Protesters have taken to the streets since Wednesday, angered by the exclusion of President Samia Suluhu Hassans two biggest challengers from the race and what they described as widespread repression.Witnesses have said police fired tear gas and gunshots to break up some demonstrations.Police have imposed an overnight nationwide curfew over the past two nights after government offices and other buildings were set ablaze. Internet access has been disrupted since Wednesday.In a statement issued by his spokesperson, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for a thorough and impartial investigation into all allegations of excessive use of force and deplored the loss of life.Partial election results announced on Thursday and Friday showed Hassan winning commanding majorities across the country, and complete results were expected in the coming hours.HEAVY SECURITY PRESENCEThe unrest presents a test for Hassan, who won praise after taking office in 2021 for easing repression but has more recently faced criticism from opposition parties and activists after a series of arrests and alleged abductions of opponents.Hassan has denied allegations of widespread rights abuses. She said last year she had ordered an investigation into reports of abductions, but no official findings have been released.Soldiers and police patrolled the streets of the commercial capital Dar es Salaam on Friday, preventing people from moving around without a valid reason.John Kitoka  a spokesperson for the CHADEMA party which was barred from the election for refusing to sign a code of conduct and had its leader arrested for treason in April  said the party had documented about 700 deaths since Wednesday based on accounts from health workers.He said protests continued on Friday in several cities, although they had waned in some due to the heavy security.We are calling for the protests to continue until our demands for electoral reforms are met, Kitoka told Reuters.GOVERNMENT SAYS VIOLENCE LIMITEDForeign Affairs Minister Kombo said there had only been a very few small pockets of incidents during the election period and that the violence was caused by criminal elements.Most Tanzanians are so much disappointed with what has happened, and they are calling for their government to end this impunity, he said.U.N. human rights spokesperson Seif Magango told reporters there were credible reports of at least 10 people killed in Dar es Salaam, Shinyanga and Morogoro.One Dar es Salaam resident, who asked not to be named for safety reasons, told Reuters a family member had been shot dead outside a hospital when he was mistaken for a protester.A police spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.Writing by Vincent Mumo Nzilani and George Obulutsa; Editing by Aaron Ross, Ros Russell, Andrew Heavens and Gareth Jones.\n\nThe U.N. human rights office said credible reports indicated at least 10 people were killed in protests in three cities, the first public estimate of any fatalities by an international body since Wednesdays vote.\n\nThe foreign ministers of Britain, Canada and Norway issued a joint statement expressing concern over the situation and urging the Tanzanian authorities to act with maximum restraint and to respect the right of assembly and of free expression.Speaking to Reuters in some of the governments first public comments on the unrest, Foreign Affairs Minister Mahmoud Thabit Kombo said the oppositions death toll was hugely exaggerated but that the authorities had not yet tabulated casualties.

Also, he did not engage the handbrake and left the ignition key on.Later, it was heard, Chingaya instructed Musekiwa to remove the car keys but he, instead, turned them on prompting the engine to start. The vehicle jerked forward and hit the female victim, who sustained fractures on her pelvis and left knee. Victim died on her way to hospital due to shock from internal bleeding.In a statement following sentencing, the National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) urged motorists to be careful to avoid unnecessary loss of lives.Vehicles are machines that should never be given to unlicenced people, the NPAZ warned.\n\nThe duo of Rasper Musekiwa (33) and Collen Chingaya (38) was slapped with three-year imprisonment terms when they appeared in court this week.\n\nThe State case was that on July 14, 2024, at around 1130 hours at Chimharize village, Chief Chikore, Chingaya failed to park his vehicle properly.

The recent significant investments in our national road infrastructure, including the ongoing Bulawayo-Victoria Falls Road rehabilitation and upgrading project, are vital for economic growth, tourism and public safety, said the government.To protect this critical infrastructure and ensure its longevity, the ministry said there will be zero tolerance for overloaded vehicles.Going forward, any truck found to be overloaded on the Bulawayo Victoria Falls Road, or any other major highway, will be subject to severe penalties and fines as prescribed by the countrys laws. This enforcement is not limited to the Bulawayo-Victoria Falls corridor as it applies to all major highways across Zimbabwe to preserve the national road network.Overloading severely damages road surfaces, leading to premature potholes, structural failures, and increased public expenditure on repairs. It also poses a serious safety risk to all road users.We urge all transport operators and drivers to comply with stipulated axle limits.
