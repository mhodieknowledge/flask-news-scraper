            "content": "By BBC\n\nA STATUE of late Pope John Paul II stands outside the Gemelli Hospital where Pope Francis is receiving medical treatment.\n\nOutside the Gemelli Hospital in Rome stands a large statue of one of its most famous patients, Pope John Paul II.\n\nMade of white Carrara marble, it depicts the pontiff in his later years, stooping and clutching a crucifix, his brow furrowed in pain.\n\nDoctors at the Gemelli hospital helped save John Pauls life, after he was shot in a failed assassination attempt in St Peters Square in May 1981. He underwent a six-hour operation to remove a bullet from his abdomen.\n\nIt was the first time a Pope had been treated at Romes largest hospital.\n\nAmong the hospitals current patients is Pope Francis, who was admitted last week with a respiratory infection. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs.\n\nOver the course of his 25 year-long pontificate, John Paul was admitted around 10 times, sometimes for prolonged stays. He received treatment for various illnesses, including a benign intestinal tumour, a broken hip and a tracheotomy, when his Parkinsons disease was at an advanced stage.\n\nThe Gemelli, which is a Catholic teaching hospital, opened in the 1960s. With more than 1500 beds, it is one of the biggest private hospitals in Europe.\n\nBuilt on land donated by Pope Pius XI to the theologian and physician Agostino Gemelli in 1934, it has become known as the Popes Hospital. John Paul II even nicknamed it Vatican Three, with St Peters Square being Vatican One, and the papal residence at Castel Gandolfo, Vatican Two.\n\nIn the 1980s, the Gemelli set up a special Papal suite, which is still in use today.\n\nIts a small apartment on the tenth floor, an all-white suite with austere, simple furnishings. As well as the bedroom and bathroom, there is a living room, with a sofa bed for his aides and a chapel with a kneeler and a large crucifix, where the Pope can attend or celebrate mass and say prayers.\n\nThe long access corridor, leading to the suite is guarded by Italian State Police, the Vatican Gendarmerie and hospital security.\n\nThe Papal suite is reserved for popes, but other patients are treated on the same floor.\n\nTheres a balcony where the Pope can appear to greet the faithful and say the weekly Angelus prayer.\n\nWell-wishers often gather in the square outside the hospital to pray for the health of the pontiff. Flowers, cards, photos and candles are often laid at the foot of the statue of John Paul II.\n\nPope Francis has been treated at the Gemelli several times.\n\n",

            "content": "By Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON  A federal judge on Friday cleared the way for one of the Trump administrations remaining steps in its dismantling of the U.S. Agency for International Development, allowing it to move forward with pulling thousands of USAID staffers off the job in the United States and around the world.\n\nU.S. District Judge Carl Nichols rejected pleas to keep his temporary stay on the governments plan to remove all but a small fraction of USAID staffers from their posts.\n\nHis ruling also allows the administration to start the clock ticking on its planned 30-day deadline for USAID workers abroad to move back to the U.S. at government expense.\n\nHis ruling comes in a broad lawsuit filed by unions on behalf of the agency staff, especially those at risk of being stranded abroad. The suit describes the Trump administration stalling needed medical evacuations for USAID staffers and spouses overseas, cutting some contractors off from emergency communications, and leaving staffers to flee political violence in Congo without support or funding.\n\nThe lawsuit more broadly challenges the constitutionality of the administrations dismantling of USAID, saying eliminating an agency would require congressional approval.\n\nAt present, the agency is still standing, Nichols wrote in his ruling. And so, the alleged injuries on which plaintiffs rely in seeking injunctive relief flow essentially from their members existing employment relationships with USAID.\n\nNichols found that the unions challenge must be dealt with under federal employment laws rather than in district court.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and the cost-cutting Department of Government Efficiency tied to billionaire Elon Musk have moved swiftly to shutter USAID, calling its programs out of line with the presidents agenda and asserting without evidence that its work is wasteful.\n\nThe case is one of multiple lawsuits from groups representing USAID workers and nonprofits and businesses that are challenging the administrations sudden shutdown of the agency, including its placing of agency leadership on administrative leave.\n\nA judge in another suit has ordered the administration to temporarily lift a freeze on funding that has shut down USAID programs and operations worldwide.\n\nNichols, a Trump appointee, said he had been very concerned about workers in high-risk areas left overseas without access to emergency communications.\n\nBut he has since been reassured by the Trump administration that they would still have access to two-way radios that allow 247 communications in emergencies, as well as a phone app with a panic button.\n\nHe said the governments statements persuaded him that the risk posed to USAID employees who are placed on administrative leave while stationed abroad  if there is any  is far more minimal than it initially appeared.\n\nThe judge also said he was satisfied by assurances from USAID deputy administrator Pete Marocco that workers abroad would be allowed to stay in their jobs beyond the 30 days even if they stayed overseas.\n\nWorkers point to expected deep staffing cuts coming at their agency and others, saying they fear they could soon be stranded abroad without jobs, visas or U.S. protection.\n\nPregnant women fear over their care\n\nThe court battle over the government plans to bring the majority of foreign staffers home has highlighted the difficulties many face in the agency shutdown. That includes allegations that the Trump administration is stalling medical evacuations for as many as 25 USAID staffers and spouses in the later stages of high-risk pregnancies, according to testimony and a person familiar with the cases. The person was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nIn a statement Friday, the State Department said it has approved all medevac requests that meet the required criteria and would not deny a request for an emergency medevac.\n\nThe State Department works with individuals needing medical evacuation to identify a clinically appropriate location that can meet their medical needs consistent with the U.S. governments legal and fiscal requirements, it added.\n\nThe administration says it is taking all required care of staffers as it terminates USAID programs and aims to recall thousands of workers and their families abroad.\n\nThe American women and their spouses, however, say they have been left in substandard medical care in posts in unstable countries, fearing for their lives.\n\nEveryone says I need to wait and see what happens with Trump administration decisions, a USAID staffer, whose pregnancy is complicated by high-blood pressure, said in a court filing from her posting in an undisclosed country in Africa.\n\nThe womans affidavit and others from staffers were filed with courts anonymously because of repeated warnings from the Trump administration that USAID staffers risk dismissal if they speak publicly.\n\nI have a due date that does not allow me to just wait and see what happens, the USAID staffer wrote. If I cannot medevac as planned, I will be in a life-threatening situation.\n\nIn another case, a pregnant spouse of a USAID worker was left hemorrhaging in a foreign hospital bed to await delivery, her husband said in another affidavit.\n\nThe intervention of a U.S. senator, who was not identified in the affidavit, secured the governments agreement to pay for a medical evacuation. But doctors say the approval came too late in her pregnancy for her to safely take a long series of flights back to the U.S., even with medical escort.\n\nThe State Department did not respond to requests for comment on workers allegations that the government was stalling or refusing medical evacuations.\n\n",

            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nBARELY a week after three unidentified men stormed Heart and Soul (HSTV) premises in Harare looking for journalist Blessed Mhlanga, the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has summoned him alleging that he contravened Section 164 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, Chapter 9:23.\n\nIn a statement Friday, police appealed for information on the location of Mhlanga, stating that they were keen to interview him.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police is seeking information on the location and subsequent interview of journalist Blessed Mhlanga. This is in connection with allegation of contravening Section 164 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, Chapter 9:23.\n\nAnyone with information should contact any nearest police station or the National Complaints Desk, part of the statement reads.\n\nHowever, Mhlanga said he is not on the run but is unwell.\n\nHaving read the police statement, having presented myself twice after being requested, I have called Commissioner Nyathi and assured him that I will be at CID by 9 am on Monday as I am currently unwell. I am not on the run. I have always complied to lawful orders, Mhlanga wrote on his X account Friday.\n\nThis is the third time in a month that police have summoned Mhlanga over unclear matters.\n\nInitially, the police accused Mhlanga of assaulting former deputy minister of finance Terence Mukupe sometime in 2018. In that case, Mhlanga was, in fact, the victim. It seems the police were barking up the wrong tree.\n\nOn the second occasion, the police summoned Mhlanga and withdrew their summons without offering a reason.\n\nIt was after this second summons that President Emmerson Mnangagwas spokesperson and deputy chief secretary to the Office of The President and Cabinet, George Charamba, said he had engaged and called police boss Stephen Mutamba to resolve the matter on behalf of Mhlanga.\n\nWhen the matter was drawn to my attention on Monday, I engaged the Police Commissioner General who was quick to look into the matter. We thank the police for this. At the same time, we continue to urge our journalists to act within the law.\n\nIt is common cause that a person on police wanted-list ceases to be a legitimate interviewee until after he is cleared, Charamba wrote on his pseudo X account trading as Dhonzamusoro.\n\nThe Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) have raised concerns over the safety of journalists after three unidentified men, who claimed to be police officers armed with pistols, stormed HSTV premises in Harare looking for Mhlanga. This incident suggests something fishy is going on.\n\nMhlanga claimed that soon after the incident, he received a call from the police CID Law and Order Section inviting him for questioning. His lawyer, Chris Mhike, engaged the police, who then said the summons had been withdrawn.\n\nPolice interest in Mhlanga developed after he granted firebrand and fearless war veteran, Blessed Runesu Geza, exclusive interviews and press briefings in which the Zanu PF Central Committee member called for President Emmerson Mnangagwa to step down.\n\nGeza accused Mnangagwa of failing to nip corruption in the bud, nepotism after biased appointments of relatives to key government and party positions, and for failing to lead the economic revival in the wake of company closures and job losses for many.\n\nGeza charged that if Mnangagwa fails to step down peacefully, the masses will use the Constitution to remove him from office, rekindling memories of the November 2017 military takeover from the late and former President Robert Mugabe.\n\n",

            "content": "UNICEF\n\nPublic health emergencies, including outbreaks of cholera, mpox and, more recently, viral haemorrhagic fevers, are posing significant threats to the safety and wellbeing of millions of children in Eastern and Southern Africa, UNICEF has said.\n\nThe high number of health crises, often worsened by climate shocks, is impacting already vulnerable communities and compounding risks to children in the region.\n\nThe alarming frequency of public health emergencies and disease outbreaks in the region is disrupting vital safety nets for children and stripping away their right to a safe and nurturing environment, said UNICEF Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa, Etleva Kadilli. Global and regional stakeholders must come together to fortify protection systems offered by families, communities and state services to ensure every child can thrive, even in the face of multiple challenges.\n\nIn 2025, 17 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa are grappling with multiple public health emergencies, the majority of which are outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as polio, measles and diphtheria. Years of stagnating and declining immunization rates across many countries in the region have resulted in a resurgence of these preventable diseases.\n\nThe region is experiencing major outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fevers, including Marburg virus disease in Tanzania and Ebola disease caused by the Sudan virus in Uganda. Additionally, mpox continues to be a significant health concern, particularly in Burundi and Uganda, with risks of cross-border transmission due to high levels of population movement.\n\nFurthermore, cholera is currently affecting 12 countries, including Angola, Burundi, South Sudan, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, with the region recording the highest number of cholera and acute watery diarrhoea deaths globally.\n\nChildren are inherently more vulnerable to the physical impacts of these diseases due to their developing immune systems and unique physiological characteristics. The risks are even greater for children suffering from malnutrition.\n\nAdditionally, when a family member falls ill, children are more likely to experience psychological distress and are at greater risk of abuse, violence or even child labor as a survival strategy for families that have been impacted.\n\nThe risks to children, especially girls  who are often responsible for caring for affected family members  are growing as multiple crises converge.During public health emergencies, women and girls are often at increased risk of sexual abuse, violence and exploitation due to family separation, disruption of social services such as education and healthcare, and increased economic vulnerability.\n\nThese concurrent and often cyclical emergencies are straining response capacities, undermining important gains in strengthening social services.\n\nIn addition to providing essential supplies, working with communities and supporting access to education, health, nutrition, as well as water and sanitation, UNICEF is working across the region to protect children from abuse, exploitation and violence.\n\nEfforts include:\n\nUNICEF is also working to ensure the continuation of essential services for children in a manner that is safe, respectful and dignified for girls and boys of all ages, including children with disabilities and other vulnerable groups. However, given the scale of public health emergencies, increased funding and international support remain critical.\n\nIn any emergency, children and the most vulnerable suffer the most, said Kadilli. Aside from investments in essential infrastructure and services, promoting routine immunization and addressing the social determinants of health, sustained funding for protection efforts must continue to be prioritised to support the overall wellbeing of children in the region.\n\n",

            "content": "By Dr. Richard Dune\n\nHow technology is transforming compliance, reducing costs, and improving care quality.\n\nGovernance and compliance are the backbone of high-quality health and social care services. These frameworks ensure patient safety, workforce accountability, and regulatory alignment. However, many organisations still rely on outdated systems, leading to inefficiencies, compliance risks, and increased costs.\n\nIn an environment where the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and Ofsted regulations are becoming more stringent, manual and fragmented governance processes can create unnecessary burdens. These inefficiencies affect compliance teams and service quality, workforce retention, and ultimately, patient and service user outcomes.\n\nDrawing from my PhD research on Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) and the development of ComplyPlus, this article explores how technology can transform governance and compliance in health and social care. With the right tools, organisations can simplify compliance workflows, improve decision-making, and create a culture of excellence.\n\nHealth and social care organisations operate in a complex regulatory environment, yet many rely on disjointed governance and compliance systems that create:\n\nThese issues go beyond operational inefficiencies. They undermine the fundamental purpose of health and social care: delivering high-quality, person-centred services.\n\nMany organisations use multiple platforms to manage governance, audits, and workforce compliance. This results in duplicate efforts and inconsistencies, forcing teams to consolidate data manually.\n\nFor example:\n\nPoorly integrated systems increase compliance costs. Many organisations spend thousands on external consultants to manage regulatory paperwork, audits, and training compliance tracking.\n\nWithout automation, organisations must hire additional staff to manually oversee compliance, significantly increasing operational expenses.\n\nCompliance should support frontline teams, not burden them with excessive administrative tasks. However, inefficient compliance processes:\n\nThe good news is that technology can solve many of these challenges, streamlining governance while ensuring organisations meet and exceed CQC and Ofsted standards.\n\nFrom automating workflows to improving audit readiness, compliance-focused digital tools reduce administrative burdens and enhance service quality.\n\nClinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) help clinicians make evidence-based decisions, ensuring alignment with best practices and regulatory requirements.\n\nKey Benefits of CDSS in Governance and Compliance:\n\nMy PhD research on CDSS confirmed that when implemented effectively, these systems improve patient outcomes, reduce risk, and enhance regulatory compliance.\n\nComplyPlus builds on the principles of CDSS, extending them into broader compliance and governance frameworks.\n\nDesigned as an integrated regulatory compliance platform, ComplyPlus tackles the root causes of inefficiencies by:\n\nOrganisations thatimplement ComplyPlushave reported:\n\nTo truly understand the power of compliance-focused technology, lets explore some real-world case studies showcasing the impact of ComplyPlus.\n\nThe challenge: Domiciliary care providers struggled to maintain accurate staff training records using spreadsheets, leading to missed deadlines and frequent audit errors.\n\nThe solution: ComplyPlus automated training reminders and consolidated policy management, ensuring real-time compliance tracking.\n\nThe results:\n\n 90%+ reduction in training-related errors. Zero compliance issues in their latest CQC audit. Freed up staff time, allowing more focus on delivering care.\n\nThe challenge: A care home faced high staff turnover, with employees citing administrative burdens as a key reason for leaving.\n\nThe solution: ComplyPlus simplified compliance workflows, reducing paperwork frustrations.\n\nThe results:\n\n Administrative tasks reduced by over 40%, improving job satisfaction. At least a 25% increase in staff retention within a year.\n\nThe challenge: A private hospital aimed for an Outstanding rating from the CQC but struggled with fragmented compliance processes.\n\nThe solution: ComplyPlus provided a centralised platform for policies, training, and audits, aligning their operations with the new Single Assessment Framework.\n\nThe results:\n\n The hospital achieved an Outstanding rating, with leadership and governance cited as a key strength. Patient satisfaction improved because staff had more time to focus on care delivery.\n\nThe governance and compliance challenges in health and social care are significant, but they are not insurmountable. Technology provides a powerful pathway to streamlining compliance, reducing costs, and improving service quality.\n\nWith decades of experience in clinical practice, research, and entrepreneurship, I have seen firsthand how compliance-focused digital solutions like ComplyPlus can transform governance in health and social care. Organisations that embrace technology now will be better positioned to meet regulatory demands, enhance operational efficiency, and deliver outstanding care.\n\nAtLearnPac Systems, we developed ComplyPlus to help health and social care organisations navigate compliance more effectively.\n\n Monitor real-time regulatory changes to stay aligned with CQC, Ofsted, GDPR, and NHS requirements. Automate workforce compliance tracking, including statutory and mandatory training. Streamline audits, policy management, and reportingreducing administrative workload.\n\nDr Richard Dune is the CEO of LearnPac Systems, a leading UK provider of edtech and compliance software solutions for regulated sectors.
