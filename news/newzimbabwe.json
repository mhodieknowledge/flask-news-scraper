This gave a sense that the municipality was moving in the right direction.\n\nAlas, it was tantamount to a fig that might appear ripe and juicy on the outside but full of ants inside.\n\nThe Mbare stadium continues to be exposed as Castle Lager Premier Soccer League (PSL) matches are played at the imposing football facility.\n\nOn Saturday, the VIP enclosure was flooded with water as rains pounded down, with a leaking roof offering little respite.\n\nThe embarrassing scenario reflected the stadia crisis the country is grappling with, which has seen Zimbabwean football teams playing outside the country.\n\nRufaro Stadium is far from meeting the international football standards set by the Confederation of African Football (CAF) for hosting matches.\n\nThe stadium does not have a media room, the tunnel to the dressing rooms has not yet been expanded, the pitch lacks a proper drainage system, and an archaic scoreboard is still in use.\n\nDespite all the glaring deficiencies, Harare City Council spokesperson Stanley Gama, in a post on X (formerly Twitter), said Rufaro Stadium is looking good.\n\nRufaro Stadium is hosting mammoth crowds without problems thanx to the City of Harare who renovated the traditional home of football and in the process bringing back top-flight football to Harare. Its still work in progress, and challenges are faced, but Rufaro looking good\n\nToday(Sunday), @capsunitedfczw hosted @ScottlandFC and the stadium was about 90 percent full. It speaks volumes to the great work done at the stadium for it to accommodate such a huge crowd. The City of Harare will keep improving those areas that need attention, wrote Gama.\n\nWhen questioned about the leaking VIP area, Gama drew comparisons with Manchester Uniteds home ground, Old Trafford, whose roof recently leaked.\n\nEven at Old Trafford such things happen. At Rufaro this will all soon be rectified, he said.\n\nThe HCC faces the task of revamping Rufaro Stadium, with failure likely to leave Harare teamsDynamos, Herentals, CAPS United, and Scottlandin limbo should the Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) reinspect and deem the stadium unfit.\n\nThe City Council had promised to complete the installation of bucket seats throughout the stadium, with only a few having been installed in the VIP section. The bucket seats are being supplied by Henrietta Rushwayas company OkimaPlastics.\n\n",

Our local government system promotes corruption and does not promote the participation of citizens.\n\nOur local government system does not promote transparency and accountability in its format at the moment.\n\nThere is marked resistance to pay rates following the revelation, with residents questioning why they should sponsor directors lavish lifestyles that include expensive international holidays while their garbage goes uncollected for years.\n\n",

She shares her own experiences along with tips on wellness, cooking, and relationships.\n\nWhile some praised her for the show, others accused her of being a wannabeMartha Stewart.\n\nAnother person on the critique seat is her father, who has also voiced his disappointment over his daughters latest series, calling it inauthentic and out of touch with reality.\n\nHe particularly took issue with her decision to distance herself from the Markle name and her claims about growing up as a latchkey kid, according to the Daily Mail.\n\nThomas, who relocated to the Philippines earlier this year, has not watched the entire show but has seen clips online. Based on what he has seen, he feels Meghan appears overly rehearsed.\n\nYou have to be authentic to hold peoples attention, he said. Unfortunately, Meghan has never been authentic. She has to think about everything. Shes not spontaneous. Everything she says is pre-planned and rehearsed.\n\nThe formerHollywoodlighting director also dismissed Meghans claims that she grew up eating TV dinners and fast food, insisting that he provided a comfortable life for her.\n\nWe occasionally ate TV dinners, which family doesnt? But I was working two jobs, so money was never an issue. We would eat out at least three times a week and order in the rest of the time, he said.\n\nHe recalled frequently taking Meghan to high-end restaurants in Hollywood.\n\nThomas also criticised Meghans cooking style in the show, calling her approach impractical for ordinary viewers.\n\nMeghan should make affordable food and show people how to stretch their food budget, he said, pointing out that she frequently uses expensive ingredients like edible flowers and elaborate fruit platters.\n\nI dont think most people these days can afford to go out and spend $90 (R1 644) on fruit. Shes out of touch with normal people, he said.\n\nSending kids off to school with edible flowers on their food is silly. Kids dont like them, and if you put edible flowers in a kids lunchbox, they would probably get teased at school.\n\nDaddy dearest isnt happy or proud of his daughter in her moment.Thomas has been estranged from Meghan since her 2018 wedding to Prince Harry, which he missed due to health issues.\n\nDespite their fallout, he still recalls their last shared meal fondly  a reminder of a relationship that seems far from mending.\n\n",

We have created an environment where they will earn money because their investment will be guaranteed, said Moyo.\n\nUS Energy Secretary Chris Wright explained the dramatic change in policy as being advised by global needs and challenges that far outweigh climate change concerns.\n\nWright highlighted that previous energy policies that discouraged the use of fossil fuels had also inhibited the growth of African economies.\n\nWe want to partner with Africa in technology, capital investment and energy infrastructure. You decide what works for your people and we will work with you to make it happen, he said.\n\nMoyo, who was accompanied by Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube, said American investment was welcome in power generation but extraction of coalbed methane gas which is abundant in Hwange and Chiredzi areas.\n\nHe added: We are an agricultural country, we want our fertilisers, so any investment in that coalbed methane gas, we could end up doing our fertilisers, which we are importing right now, and as a country that believes very strongly in agriculture, that would be a good investment.\n\nZimbabwe and the US have not seen eye to eye for over two decades. Although there has been investment in the country, it has been minimal as compared to countries such as South Africa which, up until recently, had successfully cosied up to America.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) is still pinning its hopes on the strength of the local gold-backed Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency to compete against major currencies, including the United States dollar.\n\nSpeaking during a Tourism Business Council of Zimbabwe (TBCZ) indaba recently, RBZ Governor John Mushayavanhu put up a spirited defence against detractors of the ZiG claiming robust monetary policy measures introduced by the bank were ensuring the ZiG remains bouyant.\n\nThe ZiG to USD rate is firming up, Mushayavanhu said.\n\nThe governor claimed this as a clear indication that confidence in the local currency remains the primary mandate of the apex bank.\n\nZimbabwe introduced the currency in April last year after a whirlwind battle with exchange rate volatility and runaway inflation.\n\nPart of the raft of measures adopted by RBZ is the tight monetary policy stance, scaffolded by a relatively high-interest rate regime to discourage speculative borrowing.\n\nThe RBZ governor said the central bank was working to ensure durable ZiG stability and to make the currency the pillar of the economy.\n\nMushayavanhu highlighted that de-dollarisation remained on track to meet the 2030 target of returning to a domestic mono-currency regime.\n\nAuthorities, business leaders and economists admit that the US dollar-denominated currency regime is not sustainable, given the overly strong currency, which suppresses the competitiveness of local goods and services on the global market.\n\nThe limited supply of US dollars also limits the central banks capacity to use its monetary policy tools to influence economic dynamics in the country.\n\nAmong the measures to enhance confidence and performance of the ZiG, the apex bank said economic agents were free to charge prices not fixed to the official exchange rate.\n\nThe market is free to price their goods and services at whatever USD to ZiG rate they prefer without being limited to using the official RBZ exchange rate, Mushayavanhu told delegates.\n\nThis effectively means the pricing system is liberal, allowing companies to use exchange rates that reflect market dynamics.\n\nThe governor noted that the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) would not penalise businesses for not using pricing models fixed to the official exchange rate, for as long as the pricing is with reasonable margins.\n\nMushayavanhu emphasised that economic agents attempting to manipulate the market by using untenable exchange rates would soon price themselves out of competition.\n\nThe governor revealed that some fuel traders had already approached the RBZ, offering to sell fuel in ZiG to finance their local obligations.\n\nOver time, the governor said, the fuel dealers would voluntarily sell the commodity in the domestic currency.\n\nWe do not want to go back to long queues and fuel shortages, he noted, signalling that policy decisions will be made with economic stability in mind.\n\nMushayavanhu also shot down suggestions for preferential treatment to forex access for capital projects.\n\nRBZ Deputy Governor Innocent Matshe said the realistic exchange rate, based on economic fundamentals, should be US$1/ZiG22, a level that authorities expect the market to accept.\n\n",
