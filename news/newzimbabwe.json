            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com has invited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal) to discuss the National Gender Policy as a tool to assist women businesses participating in the formal market.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, this week we want to discuss the National Gender Policy. How far do you think Zimbabwe has proceeded so far to empower women from a gender perspective?\n\nVM: It is a difficult question for any man to respond to, however, I will list some of the legislative provisions that have been put in place to empower or allow women to have better opportunities, specifically, as it relates to their participation in the economy. Whether these policies are enough or sufficient, I am not qualified to respond.\n\nOur constitution, being the starting point and anchor guide to all our legislation and policies, require the State to promote the participation of women in all spheres of life, business being one of the spheres. To enable the participation of women in all spheres of life, our constitution therefore prohibits all forms of gender-based discrimination.\n\nTo this end, a notable number of our legislation is already aligned with the Constitution to reflect this objective. If we are look at some of our economic legislation, I will give one example, the Public Procurement and Disposal of Public Assets Act, it permits preferential treatment for targeted groups such as women led SMEs in bidding processes.\n\nReporter: How do cultural norms and some trade laws perpetuate the informality of women led businesses.\n\nVM: There are a variety of cultural and social issues that result in many women-led businesses being at the bottom end of the spectrum and operating informally. In most instances, women have the responsibility of the physical care of the family, limiting their ability to participate in riskier business ventures or those that require large start up or operating costs such as licencing fees or high rentals. A majority of the resultant business ventures that avoid high up front capital will be home based production businesses, small scale retail and vending.\n\nAlthough our laws void any law, custom or practice that may infringe on the rights of women, there is still need for general public education on the supremacy of our constitution over discriminatory customary practices.\n\nFurther, reforming and allowing local laws to be gender sensitive through gender responsive pricing of operating licences including the digitalization of informal businesses for purposes of incorporating them into the formal market where they can get equal access to finance and opportunities will go a long way.\n\nReporter: You mention digitalisation of informal businesses, how can fintech assist informal businesses to scale and formalise.\n\nVM: Pillar 3.3 of the National Gender Policy promotes women access to credit and technology. Such digital platforms like payment systems may be useful for recording cashflows and how well the small business is operating. This is the information that credit companies use when issuing credit. When such businesses operate outside a verifiable system, especially when such informal operators do not have other assets for collateral, it makes it difficult to measure capacity for business loans.\n\nCollecting gender data with systems that observe data protection for purposes of aligning with financial inclusion models is critical for purposes of growing informal businesses into formal scalable businesses.\n\nReporter: To what extent are our laws aligned to shift the economy from informality where women dominate to a tech anchored formal economy?\n\nVM: Pillar 3.3 of the National Gender policy as part of its priorities aims not only to empower women, but to do so through leveraging technology. AfCFTA and SADC frameworks promote cross border SME growth through tech. Although our laws are aligned to allow for the growth of SMEs through tech, what is required is intentionality in enforcement coupled with investment in digital infrastructure especially in our rural areas.\n\nReporter: In what ways are we able to ensure that the gender equality policy has been enforced?\n\nVM: In practical terms, gender equality policies or specific policies that promote the participation of women can only be enforced once they are incorporated in the various regulatory frameworks. A failure to do so is tantamount to breaching the Constitution of Zimbabwe. Our courts are open and available to assist victims alleging breach of gender laws and where its legislative, to compel the alignment of the various regulatory frameworks to the intentions of the constitution, which is to promote the participation of women in all spheres of life.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nThese discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima on vengai@mcmlegal.co.zw or at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Mutapa Investment Fund (MIF) has engaged the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (ZIMSTAT) to independently evaluate the impact of companies under its portfolio.\n\nAs Zimbabwes first Sovereign Wealth Fund, MIF is strategically positioned to leverage resources from the mining sector and other natural assets to stimulate long-term growth and development in the country.Since its establishment through the Sovereign Wealth Fund Act of 2014, and its subsequent renaming in September 2023 by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, MIF has set out to implement strategic initiatives aimed at revitalising struggling parastatals.Presenting the Mid Term Budget Review, Finance Minister, Mthuli Ncube said the MIF has engaged the ZIMSTAT for independent evaluation.Mutapa engaged the Zimbabwe Statistical Agency (ZIMSTAT) to conduct a survey to establish the contribution of its portfolio companies to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).ZIMSTAT concluded the survey in April 2025 and finalisation of the report is in process. Going forward, similar exercises will be done regularly to assess the changes in the portfolio companies contribution to GDP, he said.The evaluation is part of the broader strategies to employ external checks and balances which strengthens public accountability and strong governance systems.In the 1990s, parastatals used to contribute a total 40% towards the GDP but over the years, the state enterprises contributions has waned significantly, prompting these entities to depend on the fiscus for survival.The coming on board of the MIF is widely seen as a positive step which will resuscitate the parastatals and align operations to profitability.Ncube said the Fund is also working with the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) on a variety of initiatives to address power shortages, which include enhancing base load, together with implementation of prepaid, net and smart metering projects.Based on the current and projected investments in the energy sector, the Fund is optimistic that load shedding will be significantly minimised in the outlook period, not least because of the rehabilitation of Hwange Units 1 to 6 under a Rehabilitate Operate and Transfer concession agreement between Zimbabwe Power Company and Jindal Africa, he added.\n\nAs Zimbabwes first Sovereign Wealth Fund, MIF is strategically positioned to leverage resources from the mining sector and other natural assets to stimulate long-term growth and development in the country.\n\nSince its establishment through the Sovereign Wealth Fund Act of 2014, and its subsequent renaming in September 2023 by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, MIF has set out to implement strategic initiatives aimed at revitalising struggling parastatals.Presenting the Mid Term Budget Review, Finance Minister, Mthuli Ncube said the MIF has engaged the ZIMSTAT for independent evaluation.Mutapa engaged the Zimbabwe Statistical Agency (ZIMSTAT) to conduct a survey to establish the contribution of its portfolio companies to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP).ZIMSTAT concluded the survey in April 2025 and finalisation of the report is in process.

            "content": "By lmran Rahman-Jones l BBC\n\nELON Musks AI video generator has been accused of making a deliberate choice to create sexually explicit clips of Taylor Swift without prompting, says an expert in online abuse.\n\nThis is not misogyny by accident, it is by design, said Clare McGlynn, a law professor who has helped draft a law which would make pornographic deepfakes illegal.According to a report by The Verge, Grok Imagines new spicy mode didnt hesitate to spit out fully uncensored topless videos of the pop star without being asked to make explicit content.The report also said proper age verification methods  which became law in July  were not in place.XAI, the company behind Grok, has been approached for comment.XAIs own acceptable use policy prohibits depicting likenesses of persons in a pornographic manner.That this content is produced without prompting demonstrates the misogynistic bias of much AI technology, said Prof McGlynn of Durham University.Platforms like X could have prevented this if they had chosen to, but they have made a deliberate choice not to, she added.This is not the first time Taylor Swifts image has been used in this way.Sexually explicit deepfakes using her face went viral and were viewed millions of times on X and Telegram in January 2024.Deepfakes are computer-generated images which replace the face of one person with another.Completely uncensored, completely exposedIn testing the guardrails of Grok Imagine, The Verge news writer Jess Weatherbed entered the prompt: Taylor Swift celebrating Coachella with the boys.Grok generated still images of Swift wearing a dress with a group of men behind her.This could then be animated into short video clips under four different settings: normal, fun, custom or spicy.She ripped [the dress] off immediately, had nothing but a tasselled thong underneath, and started dancing, completely uncensored, completely exposed, Ms Weatherbed told BBC News.She added: It was shocking how fast I was just met with it  I in no way asked it to remove her clothing, all I did was select the spicy option.Gizmodo reported similarly explicit results of famous women, though some searches also returned blurred videos or with a video moderated message.The BBC has been unable to independently verify the results of the AI video generations.Ms Weatherbed said she signed up to the paid version of Grok Imagine, which cost 30, using a brand new Apple account.Grok asked for her date of birth but there was no other age verification in place, she said.Under new UK laws which entered into force at the end of July, platforms which show explicit images must verify users ages using methods which are technically accurate, robust, reliable and fair.Sites and apps that include Generative AI tools that can generate pornographic material are regulated under the Act, the media regulator Ofcom told BBC News.We are aware of the increasing and fast-developing risk GenAI tools may pose in the online space, especially to children, and we are working to ensure platforms put appropriate safeguards in place to mitigate these risks, it said in a statement.New UK lawsCurrently, generating pornographic deepfakes is illegal when used in revenge porn or depicts children.Prof McGlynn helped draft an amendment to the law which would make generating or requesting all non-consensual pornographic deepfakes illegal.The government has committed to making this amendment law, but it is yet to come into force.Every woman should have the right to choose who owns intimate images of her, said Baroness Owen, who proposed the amendment in the House of Lords.It is essential that these models are not used in such a way that violates a womans right to consent whether she be a celebrity or not, Lady Owen continued in a statement given to BBC News.This case is a clear example of why the Government must not delay any further in its implementation of the Lords amendments, she added.A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: Sexually explicit deepfakes created without consent are degrading and harmful.We refuse to tolerate the violence against women and girls that stains our society which is why we have passed legislation to ban their creation as quickly as possible.When pornographic deepfakes using Taylor Swifts face went viral in 2024, X temporarily blocked searches for her name on the platform.At the time, X said it was actively removing the images and taking appropriate actions against the accounts involved in spreading them.Ms Weatherbed said the team at The Verge chose Taylor Swift to test the Grok Imagine feature because of this incident.We assumed  wrongly now  that if they had put any kind of safeguards in place to prevent them from emulating the likeness of celebrities, that she would be first on the list, given the issues that theyve had, she said.Taylor Swifts representatives have been contacted for comment.\n\nThis is not misogyny by
