There is a correlation between what happened after midnight,the arson, the abduction of the security guard.\n\nIt was done by people who know the job of fear. They seem to have forgotten that we have endured such harassment for the past two years, said Mandaza.\n\nThe ruling party has endorsed a resolution seeking to extend Mnangagwas presidency to 2030, which would require amending Section 91(2) of the Constitution, which limits a president to two terms, and Section 328(7), which bars incumbents from benefiting from constitutional amendments.\n\nAccording to party insiders, ZANU PF intends to use its parliamentary majority to push through the proposed changes.\n\nSpeaking at the disrupted event, Biti condemned the attacks and reaffirmed the groups commitment to defending the Constitution.\n\nWe are very sorry to Dr. Mandaza over the arson, and to Gilbert Mbwende, whose house was also attacked.\n\nThis is a new initiative by concerned citizens to resist the mutilation of the Constitution. It is not a political effort, but a civic one, to defend the rule of law, Biti said.\n\n",

This cowardly act must be condemned in the strongest terms possible. How can we live in a country that fears words? Mpofu wrote on his X account on Tuesday morning.\n\nWriting on his X account on Tuesday morning, self-exiled former Cabinet Minister, Saviour Kasukuwere, said the bombing of SAPES Trust is a shameful act.\n\nThis is shameful. A leopard cannot change its spots! We have to choose hope over fear.\n\nAlthough Mnangagwa styles himself as a constitutionalist and has declined to plan for running beyond 2028, he has done little to stop those who are canvassing support for him to continue in power until 2030.\n\nThe calls for Mnangagwa to continue beyond 2028 have caused fissures within his ruling party, Zanu PF.\n\nAnalysts have warned that the succession battle in Zanu PF could cause chaos and violence in the country, as they believe that the calls for Mnangagwa to go beyond 2028 are purely a strategy to frustrate his deputy, Rtd Constantino Chiwenga, who is widely expected to take over.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe African Regional Organisation of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC-Africa), which represents over 18 million workers across the continent, has strongly rejected ZANU PFs plans to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas term.\n\nThe ruling ZANU-PF party recently endorsed a proposal to delay the 2028 general elections, extending Mnangagwas term by two years to 2030. The resolution, adopted at the partys annual conference in Mutare, directed the ruling partys Legal Affairs Secretary to begin drafting the necessary constitutional amendments.\n\nMnangagwa is currently serving his second and final term, as is mandated by the constitution. While he has previously described himself as a constitutionalist, adding he will step down in 2028, he has done nothing to oppose his loyalists, who are pushing for him to hang onto power.\n\nIn a statement of solidarity with the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), ITUC-Africa Secretary General Joel Odigie said African workers have consistently upheld democracy and constitutionalism as the foundation of peace, justice, and shared prosperity.\n\nITUC-Africa Secretary General JoelOdigie\n\nWe join ZCTU in urging African citizens, civil society, and the labour movement to remain vigilant and steadfast in defending the integrity of their constitutions, said Odigie.\n\nSocieties that work are those governed by the rule of law, not the law of force. When constitutions are trampled, democracy dies and with it, the hopes of workers for decent work, social justice, and equitable development.\n\nOdigie called on African Union member states, regional economic communities, and global partners to reaffirm their commitment to constitutional rule and accountable democratic governance as essential pillars of Africas transformation agenda.\n\nThe continental labour leader also rejected military involvement in civil governance and condemned civilian coups, where leaders manipulate constitutions to unlawfully extend their stay in power.\n\nHe further criticised attempts to silence opposition voices, manipulate electoral systems, or stage sham elections designed to entrench authoritarian rule, saying such actions erode hard-won democratic gains.\n\nWe commend leaders across Africa who have resisted the temptation to alter term limits or manipulate constitutions for personal gain. These are true statespersons, guardians of constitutional democracy worthy of respect by future generations, Odigie said.\n\nHe added that leaders who dismantle constitutional order and weaken democratic institutions for the sake of political survival corrode governance, polarise societies, and expose their nations to instability, insecurity, and economic decline.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) says the annual inflation target set by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) remains within reach, citing consistency in the implementation of inflation containment measures.\n\nAccording to the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (Zimstat), the Zimbabwe Gold (ZWG) currency has maintained notable stability against the US dollar since September 2024, when it last experienced a major dip.\n\nZimstat data shows that month-on-month inflation stood at -0.2% in September 2025, down by 0.6 percentage points from 0.4% in August 2025.\n\nIn its latest inflation tracker, CZI expressed optimism that the RBZ will meet its 2025 inflation target by year-end.\n\nIf ZiG month-on-month inflation continues to grow by less than 1% in the next four months to December 2025, annual inflation is projected to be less than 20% in December 2025, CZI said.\n\nThis implies that the 2025 Midterm Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) targets, of keeping annual ZiG inflation below 30% and month-on-month inflation between 1% and 3%, are likely to be achieved.\n\nThe industry body noted that between July and late August 2025, the ZiG appreciated on both the official and parallel markets. Despite this, the parallel market premium remained relatively constant at around 27%, indicating some degree of exchange rate convergence.\n\nCZI added that the still-high annual inflation rate largely reflects the September 2024 devaluation of the ZiG, and that inflation pressures are expected to ease further in October 2025, provided no new shocks emerge.\n\nAfter rising in July 2025, month-on-month inflation eased to 0.4% in August 2025, a development CZI attributed to the effectiveness of the current tight monetary policy stance in stabilising prices, albeit under constrained liquidity conditions.\n\nIn the long term, monetary policy will need to gradually ease liquidity conditions as stability becomes more sustainable, CZI said.\n\nKeeping inflation below 1% enhances price stability and broadens the use of the ZiG beyond a transaction currency. Businesses that previously preferred USD-only transactions are now slowly encouraging ZiG payments to meet some of their monthly obligations.\n\n",
