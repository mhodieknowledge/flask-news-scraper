            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE retail sector in Zimbabwe is faced with a crisis following the closure of several branches, including those of reputable retailers and wholesalers owing to myriad factors.\n\nThis Thursday, President Emmerson Mnangagwa interrupted his annual leave to chair an urgent meeting with senior government officials, amid an unabating collapse of Zimbabwes formal retail and wholesale sector.\n\nThe crisis indaba, attended by Vice Presidents Constantino Chiwenga and Kembo Mohadi as well as Economic Ministries.\n\nIn a statement after the crisis meeting, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube lamented the growing informalisation of the economy and its effects on formal businesses.\n\nHis Excellency, the President, Dr. E.D. Mnangagwa, yesterday took time off his annual leave to chair a session on developments in the economy designed to map the way forward, Ncube said.\n\nThe session, which also included the two Vice Presidents and all Economic Ministries, deliberated on measures Government has taken on the economy, and developments in specific economic sectors, including the retail subsector. This culminated in additional measures being proposed.\n\nNcube said while Zimbabwe had seen economic growth averaging 5.5% annually since 2021, a slowdown of 2% in 2024largely due to an El Nio-induced droughthad impacted agriculture, electricity generation, and the broader economy.\n\nThe minister also admitted that the informalisation of the retail and wholesale sectors was a growing challenge.\n\nResearch and consultations indicate that some of the reasons formal businesses are experiencing distress include competition from the informal sector, poor management and poor corporate governance which have resulted in business failure in some instances.\n\nThe proliferation of smuggled importsmostly in reserved sectorssold exclusively in USD, and the high cost of doing business, among others, also contribute to the formal sector challenges, he said.\n\nTo combat these issues, Ncube outlined several measures, including the mandatory use of point-of-sale machines by informal traders, discouraging manufacturers from directly supplying the informal market, and the establishment of a Domestic Interagency Enforcement Team.\n\nGovernment will embark on an exercise to streamline regulatory processes, fees and charges, as well as duplication of work by Government Agencies, in order to reduce the cost of doing business, he added.\n\nFurther measures include enforcing compliance with the Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act, incentivizing industrialisation, and promoting local procurement.\n\nGovernment is committed to improving the business environment, in order to curb the informalisation of the economy, as we move towards Vision 2030, Ncube said.\n\nThe meeting came after Confederation of Zimbabwe Retailers (CZR) raised concern over the dire state of formal businesses, citing an unfavorable economic environment. CZR President Denford Mutashu highlighted challenges such as the dual currency system, regulatory burdens, and punitive taxes that have pushed consumers toward the informal sector.\n\nThe Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has penalized companies each time they deviated from the official exchange rate, despite suppliers insisting on cash payments at prevailing parallel market rates.\n\nThe crisis reflects broader economic challenges, though insiders suggest some recovery efforts are underway. As the government scrambles for solutions, the formal retail sector remains on the edge, posing a significant risk to Zimbabwes economic stability.\n\nMajor retailer such as Spar, OK Supermarkets, Choppies Zimbabwe, Surrey, among others, have either closed shop or downsized in the wake of adverse factors affecting viability of business.\n\nThe N. Richards Group has closed several outlets, while OK Zimbabwes shelves remain empty, unable to pay suppliers after the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe mandated pricing at the official exchange rate. TM Pick n Pay, owing suppliers over US$40 million, is also under pressure.\n\nOK Zimbabwe is reportedly now restocking and poised for a comeback after the government allowed the company to adjust its pricing to mid-market rates, which will allow the retailer to settle supplier debts and replenish its stock.\n\nIn Chinhoyi, the Surrey branch closed this Friday resulting in the redundancy of at least 15 employees.\n\n",

            "content": "CNN\n\nMigrant workers in Canada have been exposed to shocking abuse and discrimination while working under the countrys Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP), according to a new report by Amnesty International.\n\nIn thereportpublished Thursday, Amnesty criticized the structure of Canadas TFWP, which allows employers to hire migrant workers for primarily low-paid jobs across sectors including agriculture, food processing, construction, and hospitality.\n\nThe human rights organization said laborers were vulnerable to abuse through harmful provisions in the program, including closed work permits that tie workers to a single employer who controls both their migration status and labor conditions.\n\nAmnesty interviewed 44 migrant workers from 14 countries for the report, predominantly from what it termed the Global South, with most workers reporting unpaid wages and excessive hours. Some workers told Amnesty their contracts stipulated zero rest days.\n\nOne woman from Cameroon, Bndicte, told Amnesty she had suffered racist psychological and sexual abuse at the hands of her employer while working on a two-year closed work permit on a farm.\n\nAfter leaving the farm in July 2018, her employer canceled her work permit, leaving Bndicte with an irregular migration status. I did not expect to be a slave here, she told Amnesty.\n\nAnother worker told Amnesty he faced severe forms of control by his employer.\n\nMiguel, a Guatemalan migrant worker with a two-year visa under the TFWP, told Amnesty he was threatened and surveilled. He said his boss confiscated his passport and placed cameras in the container where he lived and the garage where he worked.\n\nThe abuse experienced by migrant workers in Canada is deeply troubling, especially for a country that claims to be a leader when it comes to protecting human rights, Erika Guevara-Rosas, senior director for research, advocacy, policy and campaigns at Amnesty International, said.\n\nAmnesty also said many workers reported living in inadequate housing conditions, with a few saying they did not have drinking water in their accommodation.\n\nAn official at Amnesty International Canada, Ketty Nivyabandi, called on Canadas leaders to implement reforms to bring the program in line with Canadas human rights obligations  and, ultimately, to respect the rights of workers.\n\nThe Canadian government told CNN it was aware of the Amnesty report.\n\nThe government of Canada takes the safety and dignity of temporary foreign workers very seriously and has been taking strong action to protect workers, said Nancy Caron, the spokesperson for Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada (IRCC).\n\nWhile in Canada, temporary foreign workers have the same employment standards, rights, and protections under federal, provincial, and territorial law as do Canadian citizens and permanent residents.\n\nShe added the government was continuously taking steps to strengthen its temporary foreign worker programs, including programs to help workers obtain private health insurance, a tip line to report wrongdoing, and open work permits to allow temporary foreign workers to change employers.\n\n",

            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nAs Southern African leaders gather in Harare today to tackle the escalating conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, a critical question hangs in the air: is President Emmerson Mnangagwa the right captain to steer the regions response?\n\nMnangagwas leadership is coming under intense scrutiny as his own political party appears to be splitting.\n\nThe fault lines within Mnangagwas party, Zanu-PF, are deepening. Two factions, one staunchly backing him and the other rallying behind Vice President Constantino Chiwenga, are locked in a power struggle, a visible crack in the partys facade.\n\nThis internal strife spilled into the open this week during the burial of a national hero Justin Mupamhanga at the national shrine where factions clashed publicly. Despite Mnangagwas pledge to step down in 2028, his silence on those calling for him to extend his rule has only fueled doubt.\n\nThe DRC conflict itself is a tempest, and Mnangagwa finds himself in the thick of it, his hands seemingly tied by domestic turmoil. Whispers are turning into shouts: some of his own comrades are imploring him to leave office peacefully, failure to which he may go the Robert Mugabe way in November 2017.\n\nThe DRC conflict has already been worsened by public spats between South African President Cyril Ramaphosa and Rwandan President Paul Kagame.\n\nRamaphosas accusations of Rwandas support for M23 rebels met with Kagames vehement denial, have created a dangerous rift. South Africas loss of 13 soldiers in DRC has only heightened the tension. Kagame, in a display of fiery defiance, has even threatened to confront South Africa militarily if it chooses confrontation.\n\nRELATED:\n\nObert Masaraure, a human rights defender and president of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ), is blunt in his observation.\n\nWhat is happening right now in Zanu PF is a clear testimony of Emmerson Mnangagwas failure to calm storms in his own party. His party is in turmoil as factions are gunning for each others head.\n\nHow then can he manage to lead the regions response to the DRC conflict? He does not have the capacity. Why is he failing to sit down with his comrades whom he went to war with and make peace? queried Masaraure.\n\nMasaraure further painted Mnangagwa as a man who creates problems but cannot solve them.\n\nHe is a man who creates problems but cannot solve the same. He created problems in Mozambique and he has created economic hardships and political conflict in the country. The man has many problems to deal with. The DRC conflict is too much for him. President Ramaphosa is the one who is now acting as if is the SADC chair, he said.\n\nAdvocate Fadzayi Mahere took to X Thursday, demanding that Information Permanent Secretary Nick Mangwana clarify Zimbabwes official stance on the escalating DRC conflict. She pointedly highlighted the divergent positions taken by South Africa, Rwanda, and even Kenya.\n\nWhose side are we on? she questioned, Or are we neutral? Or, worse, are we indifferent?\n\nMangwana did not respond to Mahere.\n\nHowever, Zanu-PF communications director, Farai Marapira, defended Mnangagwa, dismissing his critics as having put wool over their eyes and conveniently forgetting Zimbabwes history of conflict resolution.\n\nThey clearly have chosen to put wool over their eyes because they have conveniently forgotten the role Zimbabwe played in the late 1990s. Under the leadership of President Mnangagwa, Zimbabwe and SADC is more than equal to the task, he said.\n\n",
