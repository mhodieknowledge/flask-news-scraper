However, the measures introduced to preserve the value of the ZWG which include the revision of the standard and statutory reserve requirements tightened liquidity and have adversely impacted access to funding, he said.\n\nNkala said the move to suspend the Foreign Exchange Auction System which was superseded by an interbank foreign exchange market under a willing-buyer-willing-seller (WBWS) trading arrangement did not help matters at hand after the shortage of foreign currency in the formal banking sector persisted with pressure on the exchange rate resulting in an increased insistence on US$ settlement.\n\nDespite the challenges in the trading environment during the half-year period, the Group realised growth in both sales volumes and revenues.\n\nSales volumes went up by 27.69% as compared to the prior period while the gross profit margin improved from 16.83% in the prior period to 19.64% in the current period.\n\nThe growth in volume was bolstered by a successful OK Grand Challenge promotion which included the OK Mart stores for the first time which resulted in growth in the contribution of bulk sales compared to the prior period.\n\nOther expenses went up by 16,29% from US$17,3 million in the prior period to US$20,17 million in the current period largely due to the increased cost of energy supply which went up from US$5 million in the prior year to US$8,2 million.\n\n",

            "content": "By Calvin Manika | Religion Unplugged\n\nMountains form part of the breathtaking scenery and wildlife sanctuaries of Zimbabwe. They are also historically connected to the lives in nearby communities that call this place home. Pre-independence, most locals used hills and mountains to worship ancestors, believing that the spirit of the departed lives in the cool places of the mountains.\n\nA change in religion and use of places has increased over the past four decades. In fact, mountains have been used by different religions to connect with God.\n\nLocated 30 kilometers (18 miles) outside Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, is a peri-urban sprawling area known as Domboshava. The settlement is known because of its rocky mountains, a range of granite rocks. Mawanga Mountain in the area is the most popular spot, with its large cave. It serves as a sacred site for worship and pilgrimage, emphasizing the historical and spiritual significance of mountains in various religious practices.\n\nA local theology scholar, Charles Pembe, said some independent African churches are no longer denouncing the use of heritage sites for religious beliefs and practices.\n\nInstead, several Christians now come either individually or in small groups to perform their prayers at the mountains, he said. We have heard a lot of pilgrims saying they have met God on a personal level in these mountains compared to church buildings where they congregate every Sunday and other weekdays. It is subjective though.\n\nChurches across Zimbabwe of various denominations climb mountains to seek God and find spiritual uplifting. Most pilgrims frequently pray for the mountains all night long, or they climb early in the morning and remain until the evening. The Domboshava Mountains see a flurry of activity, mostly from Friday through Sunday. Religious communities travel to these mountains from throughout the African country.\n\nDomboshavas vast rocky mountains have enough room to hold hundreds of pilgrims. Of late each church has informally selected their pace, making it possible for churches to pray separately, Pembe added.\n\nVarious pilgrims use the mountains for prayers and for conducting healing sessions. This reflects a broader trend of associating mountains with miracles and spiritual encounters across many cultures and faiths.\n\nZimbabwe today is shared by a diverse populace exposed to different religions and religious ways during their upbringings such as African Traditional Religion, Christianity and Islam, among several others. Conflicts between Christian religious groups and African traditionalists who claim total authority over the site are not always visible, but they do exist.\n\nIn Zimbabwean society, the two most common religions are Christianity and African traditional religion. Its interesting to see that the management of many Zimbabwean cultural sites has prioritized the resources monumentality over their spiritual significance, said Ratidzo Matarure, a local traditional leader.\n\nDomboshava is a heritage site that both locals and tourists can visit. Those sites are controlled by the National Museums and Monuments of Zimbabwe. Despite that, the organization does not easily grant permission for prayers and other religious activities. In Domboshava, for example, Christians have been left to oversee and organize vigils and other activities.\n\nConservative and traditional churches, like the United Methodist Church, have a rich history of mountain prayer dating back decades.\n\nAlthough mountain climbing is a demanding and painful experience, pilgrims claim that it produces fruitful results. One of the pilgrims who has visited the mountains several times said the visits were not in vain and that her life has been changed since she started the praying in the mountains.\n\nI come here to pray for different issues, Tanaka Chiendambuya said. The visits have greatly changed my life and impacted my faith in God. I have seen a change in my family and obtained many blessings.\n\nAs thousands climb these mountains each year, those with resources have always been known to travel to Egypt, climbing Mount Sinai in Israel and various sites from the Bible located in Turkey.\n\nMost churches base the idea of connecting with God in mountains on the Bible, where Jesus looked for a place to serve and connect with God, Pembe said. From that vantage point, many people pray on mountains.\n\n",

However, FDI inflows were US$5.2 billion in South Africa; US$2.5 billion in Mozambique; US$2.3 billion in Namibia; US$208 million in Malawi; US$198 million in Botswana; and US$108 million in Zambia, the analysis said.\n\nThe labour organ blamed the countrys huge tax burden as chief among the causes prompting limited revenue flows.\n\nThe paper argues that no country can prosper with high taxes (Ireland-in 2015 Ireland grew by 26%). It says high taxation results in high informality and low confidence. We need lesser and lower taxes.\n\nAccording to the Chamber of Mines of Zimbabwe (CoMZ), the countrys effective tax rate for miners  69% in 2024  has already surpassed those of Zambia (60%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (61%), Ghana (56%), and South Africa (44%), placing a significant strain on Zimbabwean firms competitiveness.\n\nThe mining sector faces a complex plethora of 157 separate charges, ranging from US$4,000 to US$15,000, imposed by Rural District Councils, government ministries and agencies.\n\nThiscomes on the back of yet another wave of high taxation measures imposed by Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube in the 2025 National Budget.\n\nOverall, all these challenges have left the local economy with a huge competitiveness gap implying that Zimbabwean businesses and products are not able to effectively and successfully compete with businesses and products from other countries, the report said.\n\nThe labour organ contends that such an economic structure hurts job creation as well as the quality of employment on offer.\n\n",

Venancio Mondlane of the opposition party, the Optimist Party for the Development of Mozambique (Podemos), rejected the outcome, mounting allegations of electoral irregularities.\n\nAccording to Mozambican authorities, at least 21 people, including two police officers had been killed in the violence which erupted after the Constitutional Council upheld Chapos victory on December 23.\n\nAn electoral watchdog, Plataforma Decide says this has brought the death toll in the country to 151 since the post-election violence erupted on October 21.\n\nIn a statement, Mnangagwa said that the courts decision exhausts all lawful processes and aligns with Mozambiques national laws and SADCs election guidelines.\n\nThe Southern Africa Development Community, SADC, notes and acknowledges the ruling and confirmation on Monday, 23rd December 2024, by the Constitutional Council of Election results held in the Republic Mozambique on 9th October this year.\n\nThe ruling by that countrys top electoral court, which upheld FRELIMO Partys victory, completes and thus exhausts all lawful processes on determining election results, in line with that countrys national laws, and in keeping with SADCs election guidelines and expectations.\n\nSADC thus expects all parties to the electoral process, both individually and collectively, to abide by the decision of the Council which should provide a constitutional way forward for the country, and facilitate the way to greater peace, normalcy and stability in the interest of all Mozambicans.\n\nMnangagwa and his Zanu PF party have been accused of interfering in Mozambiques election and facilitating rigging as videos circulating online show Zimbabwean nationals voting in the Mozambican elections.\n\nHe added that SADC stands ready to assist the incoming government and the people of Mozambique in consolidating their electoral democracy based on the aforesaid court decision, which should be held sacrosanct by all.\n\nFurther, SADC urges the international community to respect the sovereign will of the people and the Republic of Mozambique, exhorting all concerned to constructively support all processes towards peace, law and order which the country and people sorely need and deserve.\n\nMeanwhile, Mondlane has vowed to install himself as president on January 15, the day that Chapo is expected to assume office.\n\n",

            "content": "Anadolu Agency\n\nDespite a ruling by Mozambiques top court earlier this week declaring Daniel Chapo of the ruling Mozambique Liberation Front (Frelimo) as the winner of the October 9 polls, opposition leader Venancio Mondlane has vowed to install himself as president on January 15, claiming his mandate has been stolen.\n\nOn Monday, the Constitutional Council confirmed that Chapo had won the disputed presidential election on October 9, extending the partys 49-year rule. However, it reduced his victory margin from 71% to 65% of the vote.\n\nMondlane of the Optimist Party for the Development of Mozambique (Podemos) announced to his supporters on social media late Tuesday that he will assume the presidency on January 15, the same day that Chapo is expected to be sworn in.\n\nMozambique has seen violent protests since late October, when the electoral authority declared 47-year-old Chapo the winner with 71% of the vote, defeating Mondlane, who secured 20% of the ballot.\n\nMondlane rejected the results, claiming widespread vote rigging and calling on his supporters to protest. The Constitutional Council was then tasked with handling the case.\n\nFresh protests erupted immediately following the court announcement, and 21 people were confirmed killed over two days of violence, which included attacks on gas stations, police stations, and banks.\n\nA total of 236 acts of serious violence have been reported across the country, which so far has 25 wounded and about 21 losing lives, Interior Minister Pascoal Ronda told journalists.\n\nThe latest fatalities brought the death toll in the country to 151 since Oct. 21, according to Plataforma Decide, an election monitoring group.\n\nProtesters have been accused of vandalizing police stations and other public institutions. While civil society and rights groups accuse Mozambican security officials of using excessive force in quelling protests.\n\n",
