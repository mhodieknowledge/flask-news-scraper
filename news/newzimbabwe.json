According to the broadcaster, the men had served prison sentences for various crimes in the United States before being declared undesirable and deported.One deportee, Tendai Moyosvi, a trained chef, said he now plans to reintegrate into Zimbabwean society and start a business after serving a decade behind bars in the US. Others told ZBC they hoped to venture into farming.Officials from the Ministry of Social Welfare were present at the airport, attempting to contact relatives of the returnees. However, one man, identified only as Mabugu, revealed he could not remember any family members, having left Zimbabwe as a nine-year-old.

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans living in the diaspora. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, this week we want to discuss fractional ownership of property by multiple investors. Is it a viable model, especially for the diaspora community?\n\nVM: Thank you\n\nIf we are to consider the entry costs for acquiring investment properties in some areas of Zimbabwe, especially those investment properties that will give a significant return for the investors, fractional ownership is possibly one of the viable options to consider.\n\nAlthough this model is available for both the local and the diaspora community, in response to your question, I will address the unique circumstances faced by the diaspora community.\n\nIt may be helpful to first explain what fractional ownership is. It is a joint ownership model where a number of investors invest in the construction or purchase of an income-generating property or even a holiday home, each investor literally owning a fraction of the property commensurate to their level of investment.\n\nThe property may be let out for rentals or the investors have time shares, meaning they enjoy exclusive use of the property at allocated times of the year.\n\nExamples of such properties that are usually invested in using this model are commercial centres that will be let out, specialised medical centres or hospitals, resorts, holiday homes or airbnbs which may also have a time share model.\n\nPooled investing allows for cheaper access to ownership as no single investor will be individually burdened with the full cost of development. All attributable risks are shared among the investors with opportunities to share ideas among investors that result in the best outcomes at the lower costs.\n\nIf lucky, in some instances, some of the investors may have specialist skills useful for the project, reducing costs and mitigating potential errors that would have occurred had the project been carried out by an unqualified individual.\n\nReporter:What challenges are commonly faced when the combined investors undertake such projects with such ownership structures?\n\nVM: The common problem is that of limited ownership; the investor is hamstrung from exercising full ownership rights and is bound by the decision of the collective. This really comes down to temperament and individual idiosyncrasies.\n\nSome investors may still want to act as if they have full ownership in situations where they do not.\n\nFurther, in circumstances where the investors are constructing and managing their own properties, the common problem is that the investors may have a different understanding of the project costs and outcomes. Normally, the project proponent, advocate and coordinator may not have fully explained or given provision for unforeseen events to the extent that there are disagreements between the various investors at project inception, implementation and or completion.\n\nLet me use the example of a completed project, a significant portion of the returns have to be reinvested in the property for maintenance and improvement, some investors will not have considered this eventuality.\n\nLastly, challenges are definitely faced where arrangements do not provide for disengagement or disinvestment procedures and processes. Investors will most likely end up resolving their issues in court at a significant cost.\n\nReporter: How best can investors mitigate against these disagreements?\n\nVM: In my view, the best way to mitigate against the common problems that arise as a result of fractional ownership is to ensure that the agreement governing the fractional ownership arrangement is as comprehensive as possible, detailing and providing various options on how the relationship may be dissolved, for example, what steps should an investor take when they intend to liquidate their investment, at what point may an investment be liquidated et cetera.\n\nOther common issues will include how the property is managed, by whom and how the investments are selected etc. Long and short, the preliminary processes have to be comprehensive enough to mitigate against the would be grey areas.\n\nIf the property to be developed or invested in performs a specific function, for example, a dialysis centre and the investors operate in that specific field or have specialist knowledge, then field-specific circumstances must also be addressed in the initial agreement, including mitigating the potential adverse situations.\n\nThe other pressing issue is that some investors may intend to enjoy their dividends in the diaspora, if that is the case, registering their investment with the Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency(ZIDA)will be useful as such registration comes with state backed protection. The investors will be assisted in repatriating some of the dividends and capital.\n\nThe general investor who wants to invest in property fractional ownership is best suited to invest in a REIT.\n\nReporter: Why do you think a REIT is a more appropriate investment model?\n\nVM: In circumstances where the investment property is not for timeshares or other speciliazed use, real estate investment trusts offer a quick in and when required,out option, allowing for investing in high return property.\n\nI say this because such trusts are typically managed by professionals with experience in these fields, who are able to identify high-rental and capital-return properties.\n\nREITs are also governed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Zimbabwe, which means that companies operating them must satisfy minimum capital requirements and are obligated to make public disclosures and distribute dividends on a mandatory basis.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

He advised Mudenda that the Japanese Foreign ministry had pledged the countrys unequivocal support of Zimbabwe in the auspicious endeavour, which concomitantly emboldened him to accordingly pronounce legislative support as per Mudendas request.Japan stands solidly behind Zimbabwes bid for the non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council, Nukaga said.Fundamentally, this position bodes well with the national aspiration and foreign policy as espoused by the President, Emmerson Mnangagwa, that Zimbabwe is a friend to all and an enemy to none and that the country is willing to contribute to global peace initiatives on the basis of multilaterarism and International law.During the two parliamentary representatives engagement, Nukaga referred to the Zimbabwe delegations fruitful interface with his longtime friend, Dr Shinichi Kitaoka, former President of Japan International Co-operation Agency (JICA) and Special Advisor to the President of JICA.Nukaga also reflected on his own fulfilling journey as President of JICA before his appointment to the position of President of the House of Representatives.During his tenure at JICA, the Speaker of the House of Representatives indicated that he was instrumental in securing financial assistance for JICA initiatives.Accordingly, he assured Mudenda that he was indeed well versed in JICAs objectives with particular emphasis to bolstering socio-economic cooperation with other countries, Zimbabwe included.The Zimbabwean Speaker extended gratitude to JICA for its unwavering support to Zimbabwe in various sectors, including infrastructure development, regional integration espoused within support for One Stop Border posts at Chirundu and the envisaged Nacala Corridor between Zimbabwe and Mozambique, healthcare sector and in Zimbabwes smart agriculture.Mudenda underscored that there was still opportunity for further collaborations particularly in the energy sector where Zimbabwe has an energy deficit which is hindering accelerated industrialisation.Mudenda extended an invitation to his counterpart, Nukaga, to visit Zimbabwe on a bilateral visit during a mutually convenient period, which he graciously accepted.Mudenda also extended an invitation to Japanese investors to explore investment opportunities, particularly in the mining sector, expounding that their investments will be protected in line with Zimbabwes constitutional provisions for property rights.\n\nMudendas visit included a fecund meeting with Fukushiro Nukaga, Speaker of the House of Representatives of the National Diet (Parliament of Japan) last Friday.\n\nIn a statement, Mudenda highlighted that the high-level visit underpinned Zimbabwes commitment to accentuating its relations with Japan.In this spirit of multilateralism during the meetings, Mudenda lobbied for Japans support for Zimbabwes bid for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations (UN) Security Council for the period 2027 to 2028.Japans Speaker (Nukaga) expressed unambiguous support for Zimbabwes bid for the non-permanent seat in line with the Japanese governments position on the bid.

            "content": "By Victor Oluwole l Business Insider Africa\n\nZIMBABWEAN billionaire Strive Masiyiwa is leading a new push to build AI infrastructure across Africa.Masiyiwa is a prominent African entrepreneur known for pioneering mobile telecommunications and challenging state-owned monopolies.He is currently focusing on developing digital infrastructure in Africa through his company Cassava Technologies.Masiyiwa plans to establish AI factories in five countries, specialized for artificial intelligence workloads.This initiative aims to empower local AI development, enhance data security, and position Africa as a leader in digital innovation.He became one of the first African businessmen to challenge state-owned telecom monopolies and win. That step made many people see him as a symbol of progress and determination in Africa.In recent years, he has stayed out of the public eye, but he has been quietly working on something much bigger. He is building a group of digital infrastructure companies that could play an important role in Africas technology future.This work is happening through his company Cassava Technologies. Cassava brings together several of his businesses that are focused on building and running the systems that make the internet work.These include fibre optic cables, data centres, and cloud computing services. Together, they are forming one of the strongest digital backbones in Africa.Through Liquid Intelligent Technologies, Cassava operates more than 100,000 kilometres of fibre optic cables that run through over a dozen African countries.These cables carry internet traffic between cities and countries every day. They connect millions of people, businesses, and public services. Having such a large network gives Cassava a strong base to support other digital services.Another part of Cassava is Africa Data Centres, which runs some of the biggest data storage and processing facilities on the continent.These data centres store and manage information for banks, companies, hospitals, schools, and government agencies. They are open to different internet providers and cloud service companies, which makes them useful to many organisations.Data centers are facilities that can provide the computing power often needed for AI operations.Cassava also runs cloud computing services through companies like Liquid C2 and Cloudmania. These provide secure digital tools and platforms that allow African businesses and public institutions to run their services locally without depending only on foreign providers.This infrastructure has taken many years to build. It gives Masiyiwa something that is rare in Africa. He controls not just one part of the digital system, but several layers of it.This puts him in a strong position as Africa begins to enter the era of artificial intelligence. He is now using this base to build what he calls AI factories across the continent.Recently, Masiyiwa announced plans to build five AI factories in South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, and Morocco.These will be special data centres designed to handle the massive computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The total investment is about 720 million US dollars.The first AI factory is already being built in South Africa. It will include around 3,000 powerful Nvidia graphics processors, which are the type of hardware used to train and run AI systems. Many African universities, researchers, and startups have already booked space to use this computing power.Cassava calls this plan the Sovereign AI Cloud. The goal is to give African countries and organisations the ability to develop and run their own AI systems inside Africa.Speaking in a conversation with James Manyika on the YouTube series AI & Africa | Dialogues on Technology and Society, Masiyiwa explained how he started paying close attention to AI around 2016.I was beginning to realize at that point that this is here now, he said.This is not something in the future.He compares its scale to one of the biggest shifts in human history.Ive been saying for a while that AI is not just like the internet; it is as big as the Industrial Revolution in its impact. The difference is the speed. The Industrial Revolution took a long time. This is going to happen in five or ten years, all that change compressed.Right now, most AI projects in Africa depend on cloud servers in Europe or North America. That is expensive and often slow. It can also raise concerns about data privacy and security.By building local AI infrastructure, Masiyiwa hopes to make it cheaper, faster, and safer for Africans to build and use new technologies.Reports say only about five percent of Africas AI talent currently has access to the powerful computing tools they need. Masiyiwa wants to change that and open access to many more people across the continent.His companies are also receiving support from international partnersThe International Finance Corporation has invested in Liquid Intelligent Technologies to help expand its data centres and fibre networks in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt. Cassava is also upgrading its existing data centres with Nvidia supercomputers so they can handle AI workloads.Large global technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon Web Services, Anthropic, and Nvidia have also worked with Cassava as partners or suppliers.In 2025, TIME magazine named Strive Masiyiwa to its TIME100 AI list and described his efforts as a major step forward for Africas digital future.If this plan works, it could help many areas of life in AfricaMasiyiwa believes Africa must not miss this opportunity. We dont want to be users any more than we want to be used, he said.We want to fully participate in the economic opportunity. Our entrepreneurs must feel they are part of this; that we are creating wealth, not just using platforms where others get the benefit.We are seeing no investment at all with respect to AI coming into Africa. No one is interested really from outside. More money comes into Africa from diaspora remittances than from foreign direct investment. Its not that our people dont have ideas. Theres no capital coming in to support those ideas, he said.AI-powered systems can help monitor crops, predict weather, and guide planting decisions.This is why Cassava has focused on building the infrastructure that can support the next generation.In healthcare, AI could help doctors find illnesses and keep patient records. In agriculture, it could help track weather, plan planting times, and grow more food.In education, it could help students learn in local languages. In banking, it could help find fraud, check credit records, and serve customers better.These tools work best when the computing power is close to where the data is collected. Building them in Africa could make them faster, cheaper, and more secure.There are still challengesAI factories and data centres use a lot of electricity, and many African countries do not have steady power supply.Bringing in advanced hardware like Nvidia chips can also be slow and expensive because of shipping delays and customs processes.There are not enough trained engineers, data scientists, and AI experts to run these systems, so more training will be needed. Each country also has its own rules about data protection, privacy, and taxes, and this can slow down projects.At the same time, global technology companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google are also building data centres in Africa. Cassava will have to compete with them while proving that its systems are reliable and affordable.But what makes Masiyiwas effort different is that it is homegrown and Pan-African.While many foreign companies are only just beginning to build in Africa, he has spent years quietly putting the foundation in place.He has built the fibre cables, the data centres, and the cloud systems that Africa will need for the future. Now he is connecting all these pieces and adding powerful AI infrastructure on top of them.If it works, the man who helped connect Africa to mobile phones may also be remembered as the man who helped connect Africa to the age of artificial intelligence.\n\nZIMBABWEAN billionaire Strive Masiyiwa is leading a new push to build AI infrastructure across Africa.\n\nMasiyiwa is a prominent African entrepreneur known for pioneering mobile telecommunications and challenging state-owned monopolies.He is currently focusing on developing digital infrastructure in Africa through his company Cassava Technologies.Masiyiwa plans to establish AI factories in five countries, specialized for artificial intelligence workloads.This initiative aims to empower local AI development, enhance data security, and position Africa as a leader in digital innovation.He became one of the first African businessmen to challenge state-owned telecom monopolies and win.

Having such a large network gives Cassava a strong base to support other digital services.Another part of Cassava is Africa Data Centres, which runs some of the biggest data storage and processing facilities on the continent.These data centres store and manage information for banks, companies, hospitals, schools, and government agencies. They are open to different internet providers and cloud service companies, which makes them useful to many organisations.Data centers are facilities that can provide the computing power often needed for AI operations.Cassava also runs cloud computing services through companies like Liquid C2 and Cloudmania. These provide secure digital tools and platforms that allow African businesses and public institutions to run their services locally without depending only on foreign providers.This infrastructure has taken many years to build. It gives Masiyiwa something that is rare in Africa. He controls not just one part of the digital system, but several layers of it.This puts him in a strong position as Africa begins to enter the era of artificial intelligence. He is now using this base to build what he calls AI factories across the continent.Recently, Masiyiwa announced plans to build five AI factories in South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, and Morocco.These will be special data centres designed to handle the massive computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The total investment is about 720 million US dollars.The first AI factory is already being built in South Africa. It will include around 3,000 powerful Nvidia graphics processors, which are the type of hardware used to train and run AI systems. Many African universities, researchers, and startups have already booked space to use this computing power.Cassava calls this plan the Sovereign AI Cloud. The goal is to give African countries and organisations the ability to develop and run their own AI systems inside Africa.Speaking in a conversation with James Manyika on the YouTube series AI & Africa | Dialogues on Technology and Society, Masiyiwa explained how he started paying close attention to AI around 2016.I was beginning to realize at that point that this is here now, he said.This is not something in the future.He compares its scale to one of the biggest shifts in human history.Ive been saying for a while that AI is not just like the internet; it is as big as the Industrial Revolution in its impact. The difference is the speed. The Industrial Revolution took a long time. This is going to happen in five or ten years, all that change compressed.Right now, most AI projects in Africa depend on cloud servers in Europe or North America. That is expensive and often slow. It can also raise concerns about data privacy and security.By building local AI infrastructure, Masiyiwa hopes to make it cheaper, faster, and safer for Africans to build and use new technologies.Reports say only about five percent of Africas AI talent currently has access to the powerful computing tools they need. Masiyiwa wants to change that and open access to many more people across the continent.His companies are also receiving support from international partnersThe International Finance Corporation has invested in Liquid Intelligent Technologies to help expand its data centres and fibre networks in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt. Cassava is also upgrading its existing data centres with Nvidia supercomputers so they can handle AI workloads.Large global technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon Web Services, Anthropic, and Nvidia have also worked with Cassava as partners or suppliers.In 2025, TIME magazine named Strive Masiyiwa to its TIME100 AI list and described his efforts as a major step forward for Africas digital future.If this plan works, it could help many areas of life in AfricaMasiyiwa believes Africa must not miss this opportunity. We dont want to be users any more than we want to be used, he said.We want to fully participate in the economic opportunity. Our entrepreneurs must feel they are part of this; that we are creating wealth, not just using platforms where others get the benefit.We are seeing no investment at all with respect to AI coming into Africa. No one is interested really from outside. More money comes into Africa from diaspora remittances than from foreign direct investment. Its not that our people dont have ideas. Theres no capital coming in to support those ideas, he said.AI-powered systems can help monitor crops, predict weather, and guide planting decisions.This is why Cassava has focused on building the infrastructure that can support the next generation.In healthcare, AI could help doctors find illnesses and keep patient records. In agriculture, it could help track weather, plan planting times, and grow more food.In education, it could help students learn in local languages. In banking, it could help find fraud, check credit records, and serve customers better.These tools work best when the computing power is close to where the data is collected. Building them in Africa could make them faster, cheaper, and more secure.There are still challengesAI factories and data centres use a lot of electricity, and many African countries do not have steady power supply.Bringing in advanced hardware like Nvidia chips can also be slow and expensive because of shipping delays and customs processes.There are not enough trained engineers, data scientists, and AI experts to run these systems, so more training will be needed. Each country also has its own rules about data protection, privacy, and taxes, and this can slow down projects.At the same time, global technology companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google are also building data centres in Africa. Cassava will have to compete with them while proving that its systems are reliable and affordable.But what makes Masiyiwas effort different is that it is homegrown and Pan-African.While many foreign companies are only just beginning to build in Africa, he has spent years quietly putting the foundation in place.He has built the fibre cables, the data centres, and the cloud systems that Africa will need for the future. Now he is connecting all these pieces and adding powerful AI infrastructure on top of them.If it works, the man who helped connect Africa to mobile phones may also be remembered as the man who helped connect Africa to the age of artificial intelligence.\n\nMasiyiwa is a prominent African entrepreneur known for pioneering mobile telecommunications and challenging state-owned monopolies.\n\nHe is currently focusing on developing digital infrastructure in Africa through his company Cassava Technologies.\n\nMasiyiwa plans to establish AI factories in five countries, specialized for artificial intelligence workloads.This initiative aims to empower local AI development, enhance data security, and position Africa as a leader in digital innovation.He became one of the first African businessmen to challenge state-owned telecom monopolies and win. That step made many people see him as a symbol of progress and determination in Africa.In recent years, he has stayed out of the public eye, but he has been quietly working on something much bigger.

The goal is to give African countries and organisations the ability to develop and run their own AI systems inside Africa.Speaking in a conversation with James Manyika on the YouTube series AI & Africa | Dialogues on Technology and Society, Masiyiwa explained how he started paying close attention to AI around 2016.I was beginning to realize at that point that this is here now, he said.This is not something in the future.He compares its scale to one of the biggest shifts in human history.Ive been saying for a while that AI is not just like the internet; it is as big as the Industrial Revolution in its impact. The difference is the speed. The Industrial Revolution took a long time. This is going to happen in five or ten years, all that change compressed.Right now, most AI projects in Africa depend on cloud servers in Europe or North America. That is expensive and often slow. It can also raise concerns about data privacy and security.By building local AI infrastructure, Masiyiwa hopes to make it cheaper, faster, and safer for Africans to build and use new technologies.Reports say only about five percent of Africas AI talent currently has access to the powerful computing tools they need. Masiyiwa wants to change that and open access to many more people across the continent.His companies are also receiving support from international partnersThe International Finance Corporation has invested in Liquid Intelligent Technologies to help expand its data centres and fibre networks in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt. Cassava is also upgrading its existing data centres with Nvidia supercomputers so they can handle AI workloads.Large global technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon Web Services, Anthropic, and Nvidia have also worked with Cassava as partners or suppliers.In 2025, TIME magazine named Strive Masiyiwa to its TIME100 AI list and described his efforts as a major step forward for Africas digital future.If this plan works, it could help many areas of life in AfricaMasiyiwa believes Africa must not miss this opportunity. We dont want to be users any more than we want to be used, he said.We want to fully participate in the economic opportunity. Our entrepreneurs must feel they are part of this; that we are creating wealth, not just using platforms where others get the benefit.We are seeing no investment at all with respect to AI coming into Africa. No one is interested really from outside. More money comes into Africa from diaspora remittances than from foreign direct investment. Its not that our people dont have ideas. Theres no capital coming in to support those ideas, he said.AI-powered systems can help monitor crops, predict weather, and guide planting decisions.This is why Cassava has focused on building the infrastructure that can support the next generation.In healthcare, AI could help doctors find illnesses and keep patient records. In agriculture, it could help track weather, plan planting times, and grow more food.In education, it could help students learn in local languages. In banking, it could help find fraud, check credit records, and serve customers better.These tools work best when the computing power is close to where the data is collected. Building them in Africa could make them faster, cheaper, and more secure.There are still challengesAI factories and data centres use a lot of electricity, and many African countries do not have steady power supply.Bringing in advanced hardware like Nvidia chips can also be slow and expensive because of shipping delays and customs processes.There are not enough trained engineers, data scientists, and AI experts to run these systems, so more training will be needed. Each country also has its own rules about data protection, privacy, and taxes, and this can slow down projects.At the same time, global technology companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google are also building data centres in Africa. Cassava will have to compete with them while proving that its systems are reliable and affordable.But what makes Masiyiwas effort different is that it is homegrown and Pan-African.While many foreign companies are only just beginning to build in Africa, he has spent years quietly putting the foundation in place.He has built the fibre cables, the data centres, and the cloud systems that Africa will need for the future. Now he is connecting all these pieces and adding powerful AI infrastructure on top of them.If it works, the man who helped connect Africa to mobile phones may also be remembered as the man who helped connect Africa to the age of artificial intelligence.\n\nThis work is happening through his company Cassava Technologies. Cassava brings together several of his businesses that are focused on building and running the systems that make the internet work.\n\nThese include fibre optic cables, data centres, and cloud computing services. Together, they are forming one of the strongest digital backbones in Africa.Through Liquid Intelligent Technologies, Cassava operates more than 100,000 kilometres of fibre optic cables that run through over a dozen African countries.These cables carry internet traffic between cities and countries every day. They connect millions of people, businesses, and public services. Having such a large network gives Cassava a strong base to support other digital services.Another part of Cassava is Africa Data Centres, which runs some of the biggest data storage and processing facilities on the continent.These data centres store and manage information for banks, companies, hospitals, schools, and government agencies. They are open to different internet providers and cloud service companies, which makes them useful to many organisations.Data centers are facilities that can provide the computing power often needed for AI operations.Cassava also runs cloud computing services through companies like Liquid C2 and Cloudmania. These provide secure digital tools and platforms that allow African businesses and public institutions to run their services locally without depending only on foreign providers.This infrastructure has taken many years to build. It gives Masiyiwa something that is rare in Africa. He controls not just one part of the digital system, but several layers of it.This puts him in a strong position as Africa begins to enter the era of artificial intelligence. He is now using this base to build what he calls AI factories across the continent.Recently, Masiyiwa announced plans to build five AI factories in South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, and Morocco.These will be special data centres designed to handle the massive computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The total investment is about 720 million US dollars.The first AI factory is already being built in South Africa. It will include around 3,000 powerful Nvidia graphics processors, which are the type of hardware used to train and run AI systems.

The goal is to give African countries and organisations the ability to develop and run their own AI systems inside Africa.Speaking in a conversation with James Manyika on the YouTube series AI & Africa | Dialogues on Technology and Society, Masiyiwa explained how he started paying close attention to AI around 2016.I was beginning to realize at that point that this is here now, he said.This is not something in the future.He compares its scale to one of the biggest shifts in human history.Ive been saying for a while that AI is not just like the internet; it is as big as the Industrial Revolution in its impact. The difference is the speed. The Industrial Revolution took a long time. This is going to happen in five or ten years, all that change compressed.Right now, most AI projects in Africa depend on cloud servers in Europe or North America. That is expensive and often slow. It can also raise concerns about data privacy and security.By building local AI infrastructure, Masiyiwa hopes to make it cheaper, faster, and safer for Africans to build and use new technologies.Reports say only about five percent of Africas AI talent currently has access to the powerful computing tools they need. Masiyiwa wants to change that and open access to many more people across the continent.His companies are also receiving support from international partnersThe International Finance Corporation has invested in Liquid Intelligent Technologies to help expand its data centres and fibre networks in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt. Cassava is also upgrading its existing data centres with Nvidia supercomputers so they can handle AI workloads.Large global technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon Web Services, Anthropic, and Nvidia have also worked with Cassava as partners or suppliers.In 2025, TIME magazine named Strive Masiyiwa to its TIME100 AI list and described his efforts as a major step forward for Africas digital future.If this plan works, it could help many areas of life in AfricaMasiyiwa believes Africa must not miss this opportunity. We dont want to be users any more than we want to be used, he said.We want to fully participate in the economic opportunity. Our entrepreneurs must feel they are part of this; that we are creating wealth, not just using platforms where others get the benefit.We are seeing no investment at all with respect to AI coming into Africa. No one is interested really from outside. More money comes into Africa from diaspora remittances than from foreign direct investment. Its not that our people dont have ideas. Theres no capital coming in to support those ideas, he said.AI-powered systems can help monitor crops, predict weather, and guide planting decisions.This is why Cassava has focused on building the infrastructure that can support the next generation.In healthcare, AI could help doctors find illnesses and keep patient records. In agriculture, it could help track weather, plan planting times, and grow more food.In education, it could help students learn in local languages. In banking, it could help find fraud, check credit records, and serve customers better.These tools work best when the computing power is close to where the data is collected. Building them in Africa could make them faster, cheaper, and more secure.There are still challengesAI factories and data centres use a lot of electricity, and many African countries do not have steady power supply.Bringing in advanced hardware like Nvidia chips can also be slow and expensive because of shipping delays and customs processes.There are not enough trained engineers, data scientists, and AI experts to run these systems, so more training will be needed. Each country also has its own rules about data protection, privacy, and taxes, and this can slow down projects.At the same time, global technology companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google are also building data centres in Africa. Cassava will have to compete with them while proving that its systems are reliable and affordable.But what makes Masiyiwas effort different is that it is homegrown and Pan-African.While many foreign companies are only just beginning to build in Africa, he has spent years quietly putting the foundation in place.He has built the fibre cables, the data centres, and the cloud systems that Africa will need for the future. Now he is connecting all these pieces and adding powerful AI infrastructure on top of them.If it works, the man who helped connect Africa to mobile phones may also be remembered as the man who helped connect Africa to the age of artificial intelligence.\n\nData centers are facilities that can provide the computing power often needed for AI operations.\n\nCassava also runs cloud computing services through companies like Liquid C2 and Cloudmania. These provide secure digital tools and platforms that allow African businesses and public institutions to run their services locally without depending only on foreign providers.This infrastructure has taken many years to build. It gives Masiyiwa something that is rare in Africa. He controls not just one part of the digital system, but several layers of it.This puts him in a strong position as Africa begins to enter the era of artificial intelligence. He is now using this base to build what he calls AI factories across the continent.Recently, Masiyiwa announced plans to build five AI factories in South Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, Egypt, and Morocco.These will be special data centres designed to handle the massive computing power that artificial intelligence needs. The total investment is about 720 million US dollars.The first AI factory is already being built in South Africa. It will include around 3,000 powerful Nvidia graphics processors, which are the type of hardware used to train and run AI systems.

It can also raise concerns about data privacy and security.By building local AI infrastructure, Masiyiwa hopes to make it cheaper, faster, and safer for Africans to build and use new technologies.Reports say only about five percent of Africas AI talent currently has access to the powerful computing tools they need. Masiyiwa wants to change that and open access to many more people across the continent.His companies are also receiving support from international partnersThe International Finance Corporation has invested in Liquid Intelligent Technologies to help expand its data centres and fibre networks in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt. Cassava is also upgrading its existing data centres with Nvidia supercomputers so they can handle AI workloads.Large global technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon Web Services, Anthropic, and Nvidia have also worked with Cassava as partners or suppliers.In 2025, TIME magazine named Strive Masiyiwa to its TIME100 AI list and described his efforts as a major step forward for Africas digital future.If this plan works, it could help many areas of life in AfricaMasiyiwa believes Africa must not miss this opportunity. We dont want to be users any more than we want to be used, he said.We want to fully participate in the economic opportunity. Our entrepreneurs must feel they are part of this; that we are creating wealth, not just using platforms where others get the benefit.We are seeing no investment at all with respect to AI coming into Africa. No one is interested really from outside. More money comes into Africa from diaspora remittances than from foreign direct investment. Its not that our people dont have ideas. Theres no capital coming in to support those ideas, he said.AI-powered systems can help monitor crops, predict weather, and guide planting decisions.This is why Cassava has focused on building the infrastructure that can support the next generation.In healthcare, AI could help doctors find illnesses and keep patient records. In agriculture, it could help track weather, plan planting times, and grow more food.In education, it could help students learn in local languages. In banking, it could help find fraud, check credit records, and serve customers better.These tools work best when the computing power is close to where the data is collected. Building them in Africa could make them faster, cheaper, and more secure.There are still challengesAI factories and data centres use a lot of electricity, and many African countries do not have steady power supply.Bringing in advanced hardware like Nvidia chips can also be slow and expensive because of shipping delays and customs processes.There are not enough trained engineers, data scientists, and AI experts to run these systems, so more training will be needed. Each country also has its own rules about data protection, privacy, and taxes, and this can slow down projects.At the same time, global technology companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google are also building data centres in Africa. Cassava will have to compete with them while proving that its systems are reliable and affordable.But what makes Masiyiwas effort different is that it is homegrown and Pan-African.While many foreign companies are only just beginning to build in Africa, he has spent years quietly putting the foundation in place.He has built the fibre cables, the data centres, and the cloud systems that Africa will need for the future. Now he is connecting all these pieces and adding powerful AI infrastructure on top of them.If it works, the man who helped connect Africa to mobile phones may also be remembered as the man who helped connect Africa to the age of artificial intelligence.\n\nCassava calls this plan the Sovereign AI Cloud. The goal is to give African countries and organisations the ability to develop and run their own AI systems inside Africa.\n\nSpeaking in a conversation with James Manyika on the YouTube series AI & Africa | Dialogues on Technology and Society, Masiyiwa explained how he started paying close attention to AI around 2016.I was beginning to realize at that point that this is here now, he said.This is not something in the future.He compares its scale to one of the biggest shifts in human history.Ive been saying for a while that AI is not just like the internet; it is as big as the Industrial Revolution in its impact.

Building them in Africa could make them faster, cheaper, and more secure.There are still challengesAI factories and data centres use a lot of electricity, and many African countries do not have steady power supply.Bringing in advanced hardware like Nvidia chips can also be slow and expensive because of shipping delays and customs processes.There are not enough trained engineers, data scientists, and AI experts to run these systems, so more training will be needed. Each country also has its own rules about data protection, privacy, and taxes, and this can slow down projects.At the same time, global technology companies like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, and Google are also building data centres in Africa. Cassava will have to compete with them while proving that its systems are reliable and affordable.But what makes Masiyiwas effort different is that it is homegrown and Pan-African.While many foreign companies are only just beginning to build in Africa, he has spent years quietly putting the foundation in place.He has built the fibre cables, the data centres, and the cloud systems that Africa will need for the future. Now he is connecting all these pieces and adding powerful AI infrastructure on top of them.If it works, the man who helped connect Africa to mobile phones may also be remembered as the man who helped connect Africa to the age of artificial intelligence.\n\nHis companies are also receiving support from international partners\n\nThe International Finance Corporation has invested in Liquid Intelligent Technologies to help expand its data centres and fibre networks in Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, and Egypt. Cassava is also upgrading its existing data centres with Nvidia supercomputers so they can handle AI workloads.\n\nLarge global technology companies such as Microsoft, Google, Amazon Web Services, Anthropic, and Nvidia have also worked with Cassava as partners or suppliers.In 2025, TIME magazine named Strive Masiyiwa to its TIME100 AI list and described his efforts as a major step forward for Africas digital future.If this plan works, it could help many areas of life in AfricaMasiyiwa believes Africa must not miss this opportunity. We dont want to be users any more than we want to be used, he said.We want to fully participate in the economic opportunity. Our entrepreneurs must feel they are part of this; that we are creating wealth, not just using platforms where others get the benefit.We are seeing no investment at all with respect to AI coming into Africa. No one is interested really from outside. More money comes into Africa from diaspora remittances than from foreign direct investment. Its not that our people dont have ideas. Theres no capital coming in to support those ideas, he said.AI-powered systems can help monitor crops, predict weather, and guide planting decisions.This is why Cassava has focused on building the infrastructure that can support the next generation.In healthcare, AI could help doctors find illnesses and keep patient records.
