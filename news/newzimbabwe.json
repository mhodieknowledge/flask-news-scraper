            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nEXILED former Information minister Jonathan Moyo himself once an architect of draconian media laws has conceded that the latest legislation requiring motorists to pay a Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC) licence fee before acquiring road authority and insurance fees was not in sync with technological advancements.\n\nThis is despite the illegality of the entire law, which is based on its discriminatory nature.\n\nMoyo, who fled Zimbabwe in 2017 at the height of the military coup that removed former President Robert Mugabe from power and subsequently saw President Emmerson Mnangagwa rise to leadership two weeks later after being dismissed as Vice President by Mugabe, launched a scathing attack on Mnangagwa.\n\nSince the Broadcasting Services Act (BSA) Amendment Bill was signed into law earlier this week, Zimbabweans have expressed widespread dissatisfaction with the new legislation, particularly clause 15, which mandates that motorists must pay the ZBC licence fee  without which they cannot purchase their ZINARA vehicle licence and insurance.\n\nMoyo, who had grown cautious about openly attacking Mnangagwa on platforms like X and in interviews with regional and international news organisations over the past two years, has now waded back into the debate around the ZBC licence fee for motorists.\n\nBasically, the revolution in digital technologies has outdated car radio licences, which is why they have been vacated worldwide, Moyo wrote on X on Friday.\n\nHe added that Mnangagwas government still has an opportunity to repeal the new law, as it is outdated and has been overtaken by technological progress.\n\nIn this connection, the Second Republic had, and still has, an opportunity to repeal the 2001 car radio fee as an outdated, no longer necessary, inconvenient, now unreasonable, and unfair tax burden, Moyo said.\n\nHe further commented: The challenge for a broadcasting licence fee nowadays is how to structure it, perhaps as a tax, taking into account the rapid and massive technological and social transformation taking place.\n\nMoyo implored Mnangagwa to hit the brakes on implementing the controversial law, arguing it must be revised through a digital lens.\n\nIt would be in both the public and national interest to pause the implementation of the car radio licence in order not only to rethink it; but to also review the very idea of a radio and television licence in a digital world; with a view to coming up with a more suitable and modernised, user-friendly, alternative model of a single and comprehensive broadcasting licence fee model, he said.\n\n",

This was after his company, TN Asset Management, underwrote a rights issue for the company late last year.\n\nResponding on his X (formerly Twitter) recently, Nyambirai clarified that while he cannot speak on behalf of Steward Bank or EcoCash Holdings, he vowed to push for an official disclosure via the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE).\n\nA legal notice on the change of name of Steward Bank Limited has generated a lot of interest here on X.\n\nWe shall seek the authority of the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange to publish an update on the name changes. The update shall seek to answer some of the questions that have been raised, he said.\n\nA name looked at in the abstract might be meaningless. But the way the owner carries the name gives it value. Many Zimbabwean bank names lack obvious meanings, yet their strength lies in how they deliver on their promises.\n\nThe present generation would have demanded that Henry Wells and William Fargo change names first, before they named their banks, Wells Fargo after themselves, he said.\n\nThe rebranding process, he noted, will follow stringent corporate governance procedures, including shareholder consultations.\n\nMarket watchers believe that Nyambirais challenge remains convincing the public that the new identity will uphold or surpass the banks legacy.\n\n",

M.

The roll out of these systems must be publicised and see greater discipline on our roads.Although the long-delayed project is now complete, its high cost reported at US$88 million has sparked public and parliamentary debate, with calls for an audit to clarify how the funds were used, as many accuse the government of massive looting.\n\n",
