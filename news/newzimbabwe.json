The event will mark the launch of an annual initiative designed to foster long-term partnerships that promote sustainable economic growth and development.\n\nZimUKBCs primary mission is to connect people in business, facilitate peer networking, support enterprise growth, and empower small and medium-sized businesses to reach their full potential. With members drawn largely from Zimbabwe and Southern Africa, the organisation supports businesses across diverse sectors including health and social care, retail, agro-business, manufacturing, finance, services, and technology.\n\nIt also serves as a powerful voice in policy discussions, ensuring that the interests of its members are heard at the highest levels. The Trade and Investment Indaba will serve as a platform to promote Zimbabwes untapped potential, encourage joint ventures between UK investors and Zimbabwean SMEs, and showcase opportunities across industries such as agriculture, mining, manufacturing, tourism, infrastructure, finance, technology, and logistics.\n\nIn convening this event, ZimUKBC will work closely with key national agencies and institutions, including the Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency (ZIDA), ZimTrade, the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC), and the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI), all of which share the vision of expanding exports, attracting foreign investment, and fostering bilateral trade.\n\nThe Indaba will feature high-level business-to-business networking sessions, thought-provoking presentations, and a celebratory gala dinner to mark the launch of this new tradition. Distinguished guests will include a senior trade and investment official from the British Embassy in Zimbabwe, adding to the significance of the occasion.\n\nKennedy Mwedziwendira, Chairman and Founder of ZimUKBC, expressed his excitement about the event, describing it as a pivotal moment for diaspora-driven investment and trade.\n\nThis Indaba will be a pivotal platform to build meaningful partnerships between UK investors and Zimbabwean businesses, particularly within the diaspora community. We are excited to establish it as an annual event that accelerates investment, trade, and sustainable economic growth, he said. The ZimUK Business Chamber sees this first gathering as the foundation for stronger economic bridges between Zimbabwe and the United Kingdom, with the potential to contribute significantly to the countrys development while opening new opportunities for UK investors in one of Africas most promising markets.\n\n",
