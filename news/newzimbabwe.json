            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nHUMAN rights defenders have criticised the recent bombing of opposition leader Job Sikhalas Chitungwiza home, amid fears of a renewed wave of raids on properties linked to exiled Zimbabweans.\n\nThe alleged bombing of Sikhalas house while he was away in South Africa raises the spectre of a fresh campaign of political persecution, says human rights activist Munacho Humbasha.\n\nHe says the attack on Sikhalas house is a chilling message to critics of Zanu PF, both at home and abroad.\n\nSikhala, a former legislator and long-time government critic, has been frequenting South Africa for medical and political engagements.\n\nHumbasha told NewZimbabwe.com that Zanu PF functionaries and State security agents have openly declared war on activists in the diaspora, with families back home being deliberately targeted.\n\nThose with houses visited in the widening campaign and searches include that of Petty Ziramba, Panganayi Mauzinyu, Ralph Dube, Fransisca Chiduku, and Shepherd Yuda, said Humbasha.\n\nIn Mabvuku, unknown men believed to be State agents raided the home of the late opposition activist Tonderai Ndira. The assailants took household property and left the house empty, promising to return and destroy their livelihoods. The family is still in shock.\n\nIn Harare, suspected operatives broke into Blessing Makeyis house and again into his family home, allegedly searching for incriminating material. Makevi has been active in diaspora protests against President Emmerson Mnangagwas government, Humbasha told NewZimbabwe.com in an interview.\n\nAlso, another dissenter, Ralph Dubes family, is living in uncertainty after receiving threatening messages, says Humbasha.\n\nBack home, he further claimed, several homes in Seke, Chitungwiza, having been visited by suspicious individuals in recent days, thereby sparking fears in the community.\n\nDespite repeated reports of break-ins and intimidation, police have not arrested anyone in connection with the incidents. Efforts to get a comment from police national spokesman, Commissioner Paul Nyathi, were fruitless by the time of publishing.\n\nVictims and their families say the inaction points to the States complicity.\n\nThis is meant to punish those of us who are in the UK and elsewhere. Our families are being harassed everyday because we speak out, said UK-based activist, Melody Magejo, who spoke to NewZimbabwe.com in a telephone interview.\n\nA human rights lawyer, who preferred anonymity, said as Mnangagwa gravitates towards entrenching his rule through his 2030 agenda, the political environment is set to worsen.\n\nThe use of Patriotic Act and Cyber Security Act 2023 will lead to many arrests of those who are actively participating in campaigns on social media.\n\nIt is without a doubt that Mnangagwas government does not want the outside world to know what is happening in the country, said the lawyer.\n\n",

The lack of clarity is creating devastating consequences, they said.\n\nAccording to HSF and CoRMSA, many Zimbabweans on the permit have already lost jobs, struggled to enrol their children for the 2026 school year, and faced difficulties accessing basic healthcare. They argue that these hardships show why the government must act well before the November deadline.\n\nHSF and CoRMSA call on the Minister of Home Affairs to urgently provide clarity on the status of the consultation process, theorganisations insisted.\n\nIf the process cannot be implemented in time, government must extend the ZEP well before the November deadline. Such action is necessary to prevent further hardship and to uphold fairness and the rule of law.\n\nThe ZEP, first introduced in 2009 to regularise the stay of Zimbabweans in South Africa, has faced years of uncertainty.\n\nA June 2023 High Court ruling ordered the Department of Home Affairs to ensure a fair process before terminating the programme, a decision later confirmed by the Constitutional Court.\n\nAs a result, the permit remains valid until late November 2025.\n\nBut with only months left before that deadline, rights groups warn that the clock is ticking and that delay is once again throwing thousands of lives into chaos.\n\n",

Ghanas parliament passed an anti-homosexuality bill last year, but the then-president did not sign it into law.\n\nOf all the countries, Uganda adopted the toughest provisions, making what it describes as aggravated homosexuality a capital offense and imposing life sentences for consensual same-sex relations.\n\n",

            "content": "Report Focus News\n\nZimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa met China Railway International Group executives Tuesday to finalise a $533 million infrastructure deal aimed at revitalizing the southern African nations deteriorating rail network.\n\nThe discussions focused on Zimbabwes digital future, including expanding investment in ICT talent, strengthening infrastructure, and introducing advanced technologies into the country. The meeting occurred as Mnangagwa arrived in Beijing to attend Wednesdays commemoration of the 80th anniversary of Japans World War Two surrender.\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncube confirmed the investment value during earlier negotiations. We believe that we could make use of their expertise and financial muscle to improve the NRZ, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube said in a weekend interview.\n\nThe deal involves TransTech Engineering Corporation, a China Railway International Group subsidiary with extensive African infrastructure experience. The company previously built the 1,860-kilometer Tanzania-Zambia railway and Ethiopias Addis Ababa-Djibouti line.\n\nZimbabwes rail network has declined sharply from its 1990s peak when it transported 12 million tons annually. National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) now hauls less than three million tons.\n\nThe infrastructure deterioration has severely impacted mineral exports, particularly from Chinese mining operations. Companies including Tsingshan Holdings, Sinosteel and Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt face transportation constraints moving lithium, chrome and coal to ports.\n\nThe modernization project includes rehabilitation of existing lines, new signaling systems, acquisition of 17 locomotives and 209 freight wagons. Additionally, NRZ is exploring a partnership with the University of Zimbabwe to develop railway solutions through the universitys innovation hub.\n\nPhase one encompasses five new stations and a critical Beitbridge-Harare line connecting to South Africa, Zimbabwes largest trading partner.\n\nZimbabwe is on the verge of clinching a deal with the Chinese Railway Group so work on this critical enabler starts, presidential spokesman George Charamba said in Beijing.\n\nNRZ Public Relations and Stakeholder Manager Andrew Kunambura confirmed that the feasibility study has been completed and a report will be presented.\n\nThe project forms part of Zimbabwes broader rail strategy involving 11 private companies. South Africas Grindrod deployed three locomotives and 150 wagons through its Beitbridge Bulawayo Railway subsidiary since March 2024.\n\nChina remains Zimbabwes largest investor with total investments exceeding $4.4 billion. In 2024 alone, trade between the two countries reached US$3.8 billion  a 24% increase from the previous year.\n\nThe railway investment addresses Zimbabwes push to achieve its $12 billion mining industry target by improving mineral transport to Mozambique and South African ports for Asian markets.\n\nFunding mechanisms remain undisclosed, though analysts expect Chinese loans and contractor financing arrangements, adding to Zimbabwes existing debt obligations to Chinese entities.\n\nThe formal announcement was initially planned for the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation in August but has been delayed pending final negotiations.\n\n",
