            "content": "Al Jazeera\n\nLong-frozen relations between the United States and Zimbabwe may be thawing after the Southern African nation slashed all taxes on US goods flowing into the country and announced it has begun to pay compensation to white farmers who lost land during controversial, sometimes violentland expropriation reformsthat were instituted 25 years ago\n\nThe moves come amid a wave of sweepingtariffsimposed on countries around the world by US President Donald Trump, and as other countries scramble to renegotiate with Washington.\n\nAlongside his stated aim of reducing trading deficits with the USs trading partners, Trump has repeatedly claimed that white farmers in Southern Africa are discriminated against. Both he and his adviser, South African-born Tesla billionaire Elon Musk, have criticised the treatment of white minorities in South Africa, alleging that they face discrimination. Zimbabwe and South Africa have white minority populations who are mainly descendants of British settlers.\n\nMeanwhile, Zimbabwe has been in the throes ofeconomiccollapse for more than two decades. Over that time, hyperinflation has weakened the economy, killed jobs, and seen the introduction of several legal tenders, from the US dollar to thenew gold-backed ZiG.\n\nSo, might Zimbabwe be trying to please the US and woo President Trump in the hope of economic gains? And could that work? Heres what we know:\n\nPresident Trumps April 2Liberation Daytariff announcements saw dozens of countries hit with varying surcharges on goods imported to the US, including Zimbabwe, which was hit with an 18 percent levy on all products it exports there.\n\nTariffs levied on African nations by President Trump vary. Neighbouring Lesotho has been hit with the highest tax of any African nation at 50 percent, and is currently seeking to renegotiate with the White House.\n\nZimbabwe mostly exports steel components, tobacco and sugar to the US while the US exports machinery, pharmaceuticals and agricultural produce to the Zimbabwean market.\n\nTrade between the two countries is limited, reaching a total of about $111.6m in 2024. US exports to Zimbabwe amounted to $43.8m, while imports from Zimbabwe were $67.8m. The trade deficit in favour of Zimbabwe was, therefore, just over $24m, according toUS government data.\n\nCountries around the world have been scrambling to negotiate a reduction in tariffs with Washington. On April 9, the White Houseplaced a 90-day pauseon the reciprocal tax hikes to allow time for country representatives to strike deals and because most countries had not retaliated, Trump said. The only exception is China, which has opted to go head-to-head by reciprocating and increasing taxes on US imports into the country to 125 percent and will not benefit from the pause.\n\nZimbabwe has taken an entirely different approach. In a post on X on April 5, Zimbabwes President Emmerson Mnangagwa announced that all taxes on US imports would be scrapped in order to build a positive relationship with Washington.\n\nThe move is intended to facilitate the expansion of American imports within the Zimbabwean market, while simultaneously promoting the growth of Zimbabwean exports destined for the United States, the Zimbabwean president said.\n\nZimbabwe is the first country to suspend tariffs on US goods in response to Trumps tariffs announcement. Until now, most goods entering the country have been subject to a 15 percent levy.\n\nIts unlikely, experts say. South Africa-based economist Eddie Mahembe from business consultancy Underhill Corporate Solutions,said Zimbabwe cannot afford not to tax US imports and the move could worsen the countrys already frail economy.\n\nItll mean that US goods will flood Zimbabwe, and then it will kill the economy more, Mahembe told Al Jazeera. Local competitors, already affected by hyperinflation and cheap goods coming in from China, are likely to suffer more, he added. Zimbabwe could see less production, more unemployment and even lower revenues from levies, he said.\n\nWhat they did was not necessary, at all, Mahemmbe added, referring to the Zimbabwean government.\n\nExperts also say the move could cause tension with Zimbabwes biggest trading partners  South Africa, China and the United Arab Emirates, who might question why they should still pay tariffs on their goods entering Zimbabwe, when the US does not have to. This move could sour Zimbabwes relationships with partners, policy analysts Craig Moffat and EM Hoza wrote in an opinion piece for the South African newspaper, The Mail and Guardian.\n\nThese countries might demand similar tariff exemptions or seek to renegotiate trade terms  Zimbabwes actions could be perceived as undermining the principles of fair, non-discriminatory trade.\n\nOn April 10, Zimbabwean Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube told reporters the government had approved a disbursement of $3.1m in compensation to be shared by white farmers displaced from nearly 400 farms seized by the government in 2000 after then-President Robert Mugabe signed a controversial land expropriation programme. This is the first in a series of planned compensation payments.\n\nThe Zimbabwean government did not explicitly state that the recent payments were prompted by President Trumps tariffs announcement and negotiations.\n\nMugabes land programme was supposed to redistribute land to disadvantaged Black Zimbabweans with the aim of boosting equity and agricultural development. Land was seized from some 4,000 white farmers, sometimes forcefully and violently between 2000 and 2001, and at least seven farmers were killed.\n\nUntil that point, minority white people, who made up about 4 percent of the population, owned more than half the land in Zimbabwe, while locals were crowded into native reserves.\n\nHowever, the policyfailed to achieve its aimand contributed to the weakening of the Zimbabwean economy. Rather than resettle peasants, the political elite including Mugabes family, acquired large swaths of land for rent. Farming output dropped significantly, causing food supply chains to dry up. Zimbabwe was also sanctioned by several Western countries, including the US, for the move.\n\nIn 2020, after two decades of crippling sanctions, thegovernment agreedto pay white farmers $3.5bn for infrastructure such as wells, irrigation equipment and buildings on seized land. Only 1 percent was to be paid in cash, with the balance to be settled with treasury bonds. According to Finance Minister Ncube, the government has now issued treasury bonds for the first batch of farmers.\n\nThe payments have caused controversy in the country, with some Black Zimbabweans questioning why public money is being used to compensate the farmers, rather than being paid directly by those who benefitted from the policy.\n\nZimbabwean politics are currently dominated by a power struggle within the ruling ZANU-PF party.\n\nZimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who came to power in 2017 on promises of democratic and economic reforms, isfacing pressureto step down from within his party after his current, second term. ZANU-PF has dominated government since the countrys independence in 1980.\n\nA succession battle has erupted ahead of the general elections scheduled for 2028. Factions have emerged: one supporting a prolonged, unconstitutional third term for Mnangagwa, 82, so that he can continue with his reforms, and another supporting the ascendancy of Constantino Chiwenga, his 68-year-old vice president.\n\nExperts say the government hopes its recent decision to cancel tariffs on US goods may lead to a lifting of sanctions by countries like the US and other potential international lenders. That could provide some respite for Zimbabwe after years of economic decline.\n\nHowever, economist Mahembe said the tariff move was more likely to ingratiate a small, political elite with the US and other markets, to enable those few to benefit from lucrative mineral sales.\n\nIn March 2024, First Lady Auxillia Mnangagwa, alongside her husband and several other government officials,was sanctioned by the United Statesfor alleged involvement in illicit diamond and gold networks.\n\nEarlier, in 2023, an Al Jazeera investigation revealed that Zimbabwean officials were usingsmuggling gangsto sell the countrys gold to soften the impact of sanctions.\n\nIts not just about the country, its also really more about them, Mahembe said, referring to the countrys political elite.\n\nIts unclear if President Mnangagwa can achieve his stated goal of building a better, positive relationship with Washington.\n\nRegarding compensating white farmers, it is unclear whether the recent move to make the first compensation payments is designed to please Trump.\n\nFurthermore, some problems concerning the payments have emerged. A group of affected farmers accused the government on Wednesday of over-stating the amounts being paid and said the amount being paid now is too low.\n\nIn a statement, Deon Theron, acting chairman of the Compensation Steering Committee set up to represent farmers, also said officials in Harare had not properly consulted the majority of the farmers in the compensation process.\n\nIn reality, only a small token payment has been made and thousands of farmers, the significant majority by number, remain uncompensated, Theron said.\n\nThe $3.5bn agreed to was already a substantial discount on the actual value of the properties, and these payments have reached fewer than 10 percent of farmers, he added.\n\n",

Thismarks the final competition authority approval required across all applicable jurisdictions forthe implementation of the alternative transaction, said the company.\n\nTongaat Hulett and the Business Rescue Practitioners continue to work closely with Vision to finalise the implementation of the transaction. This collaborative effort underscores a shared commitment to revitalising Tongaats operations for the benefit of employees, cane growers, suppliers and rural communities.\n\nThe alternativetransactionforms the cornerstone ofthe Tongaat Hulett adoptedbusinessrescueplanandentails the sale ofthe troubled South African agro-processing and sugar manufacturersbusiness and assets including those in Zimbabwe, Botswana and Mozambique among others as a going concern.\n\nThe sale will be finalised in a consolidated group transactionto Vision.\n\nThe transaction includes the sale of Tongaat Huletts South African assets, including its sugar operations and corporate head office, as well as the sale of its shares in and claims against the Zimbabwe, Mozambique, and Botswana businesses.\n\nEarlier this year, theHigh Court in Durban dismissed RGS Group Holdings application seeking to interdict Vision Groups implementation of Tongaat Huletts business rescue plan related to the sale of the agro-processing entitys assets and businesses.\n\nLast year, creditors in Tongaat voted in favour of a business rescue plan put forward by Vision.\n\nThis was after an accounting scandal rocked Tongaat Hulett, with the company tail-spinning into a debt of R8.2 billion and prompting shareholders to adopt an amended business rescue plan, which the companys business rescue practitioners now intend to implement.\n\nTongaat Hulettis envisioned to continue playing critical rolesin the economic fabric of Southern Africa.\n\nIn South Africa, the businessremains a cornerstone of the sugar industry, directly employing 2600 individuals, indirectly supporting 25 500 rural jobs and sourcing cane from 15 000 small-scale growers  thereby sustaining local farming communities, and underpinning numerous rural economies, especially in theKwaZulu-Natalprovince.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, Tongaat Hulett owns two operating businesses, Triangle and separately listed Hippo Valley Estates.Triangle saidrecentlythat it was facing operational challenges that had forced it to retrench employees after cost-cutting measures failed to yield a respite.\n\nItsaid it had seenprofit margins decline significantly by 55%, with manpower costsspikingby 133% as a proportion of revenue and debt levels rose to unsustainable levels.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nA migrant social care worker has said her employer threatened to cancel her visa if she complained about being forced to work long hours without any days off.\n\nSophia  not her real name  said she paid more than 2,000 in fees to a South Yorkshire care company that sponsored her visa to come to the UK from Zimbabwe to work for them in 2023.\n\nThe Home Office has cracked down on abuse and exploitation by some care companies by revoking their licences, leaving many workers without a job.\n\nLeeds City Council, which oversees a Yorkshire-wide project to find new jobs for unemployed overseas workers, said there had been challenges in matching people with roles.\n\nSophia came to the UK on a health and care worker visa, designed to help plug staffing gaps in the sector.\n\nShe said she was placed in an unregistered, multi-occupancy house and when she complained that she was paying too much for the accommodation was told she was not grateful.\n\nSophia added that she was threatened with having her Certificate of Sponsorship terminated  a document provided by an employer that is required for the visa to be valid.\n\nYoure supposed to be quiet, so we had to suffer in silence, Sophia said. You cant move, you cant breathe, you are stuck.\n\nYou have sacrificed everything to come here so that you can start a new life. When you get here, you see the treatment is not good.\n\nSophia said she was often out of the house for 16 hours a day for work, without any days off.\n\nShe felt unable to seek any other employment because her visa depended on the care company.\n\nThe union Unison has called for the government to take control of issuing Certificates of Sponsorship, to stop individual care companies having an enormous amount of power over workers.\n\nJordan Stapleton, the unions regional migrant lead, said: Were seeing migrant workers who are having to pay thousands of pounds in illegal fees, often working 16 hours a day, often without a break, not getting paid correctly, not being paid for travel time and being threatened with deportation and their visa being removed if they complain.\n\nAlthough the government has been revoking the licence of some of these employers, many employers are still operating because [employees] darent report them.\n\nJamila Duncan-Bosu, a solicitor from the charity Anti Trafficking and Labour Exploitation Unit (Atleu), said she had seen a rise in the number of inquiries from care workers seeking legal action over their experiences.\n\nThere needs to be a proper safety net, she said.\n\nBetween July 2022 and December 2024, the government said it had revoked more than 470 care providers licences, which enable companies to give visas to overseas workers across England, where there were concerns about abuse and exploitation.\n\nBut the move had left thousands of the workers unemployed.\n\nHome Office figuresreleased last monthrevealed more than 39,000 workers had been associated with these care providers since October 2022.\n\nTo help find the workers find new jobs, in March 2023, the then-Conservative government gave councils across England a total of 16m to tackle the exploitation of overseas workers, help find them new work and offer support.\n\nLeeds City Council runs the Yorkshire and Humber branch of the project.\n\nThe project said it had been approached by 4,355 workers who had been left without employment after having their visa sponsorships revoked.\n\nIt had successfully matched 71 people to new roles or new sponsors since it launched two years ago.\n\nA council spokesperson said a lack of Home Office-approved sponsor organisations in the area affected the number of job matches.\n\nWe recognise that there have been challenges across the region in finding workers new sponsors, which is in line with national recruitment issues faced by organisations in the care sector across the UK, they said.\n\nA government spokesperson said they were determined to protect migrant care workers from exploitation and abuse, including from employers that fail to provide work they had promised or non-payment of minimum wage.\n\nWhere there is evidence of illegal and unethical practices, we will always take action as swiftly as possible, they said.\n\nDan Archer, chief executive of home care service Visiting Angels, which has no involvement with Sophias case, said his company had chosen not to hire staff through the visa scheme.\n\nHe said in some cases hiring overseas workers was the wrong solution to fix the staffing shortage.\n\nIt feels exploitative, bringing people to the UK to ask them to do a job that not enough people in the UK are prepared to do, he said.\n\nInstead, Mr Archer said the company aimed to make the job more attractive to workers already in the UK, by offering better pay and avoiding zero-hour contracts.\n\nElaine Thompson, from Thurnscoe, near Barnsley, said she had relied on the firms care since her husband died five years ago.\n\nHer carer, mother-of-three Natalie Henstalk, said she enjoyed the job because she felt she was helping people and flexible hours meant she could also look after her children.\n\nI love my job. Its a good job to have, she said.\n\n",
