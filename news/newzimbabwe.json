The tender was approved by the NetOne board, with Farevic Systems (Pvt) Ltd awarded the contract worth US$2,422,500 to supply and implement the SAP system.\n\nProsecutors allege that while Farevic was still implementing the project, Mushanawani, acting in connivance with other NetOne managers who are yet to be arrested, devised a scheme to siphon company funds. He allegedly misled the Executive Management Committee and the board into believing that it was necessary to upgrade the old SAGE 1000 system, which was already being phased out.\n\nThrough this misrepresentation, Mushanawani allegedly signed a separate contract with Lunartech Solutions (Pvt) Ltd worth US$257,600 for the so-called SAGE 1000 upgrade. He later signed several addendums, inflating the cost of the project to US$1.2 million.\n\nTo date, NetOne has allegedly paid Lunartech US$654,331.60 without the knowledge or approval of the board.\n\nThe State further alleges that Mushanawani and his accomplices fraudulently committed the company to a separate consultancy contract with Diztech valued at US$79,467.49, even though the same services were already included and paid for under the original Farevic contract.\n\nAs a result, NetOne was allegedly prejudiced of US$654,331.60, with a potential further prejudice of US$625,135.89.\n\nMushanawani is expected back in court on October 22 for his routine remand.\n\n",

He was recently convicted of hate speech.\n\nMalema was convicted of five offences, including the unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition, discharging it in a public space and reckless endangerment. The first charge carries a maximum 15-year sentence.\n\nHe was accused of firing between 14 and 15 live rounds on a stage in front of 20,000 EFF supporters, according to South African news site SowetanLIVE.\n\nIn his defence, Malema told the court the firearm was not his and that he had fired the shots to rouse the crowd, the publication added.\n\nIt took three days for magistrate Twanet Olivier to tell Malema you are found guilty as charged. The case was postponed to January 2026 for pre-sentencing.\n\nMalemas prosecution came after Afrikaner lobby group AfriForum, which has a contentious relationship with Malema and the EFF, opened a case against him after the video went viral.\n\nAfriForum was also among those who laid a hate speech complaint against the EFF MP at South Africas Human Rights Commission.\n\nThis resulted in his conviction by the countrys equality court in August this year.\n\nAfter an incident where a white man allegedly assaulted an EFF member, Malema said: No white man is going to beat me up you must never be scared to kill. A revolution demands that at some point there must be killing.\n\nThe equality court ruled that these remarks demonstrated an intent to incite harm, but the EFF said they were taken out of context.\n\n",

Taxes paid for the period under review, including Excise Duty, Corporate Tax, VAT, Customs Duties, PAYE and Withholding Tax, which came to a total of over USD8.1 million, he said.\n\nDespite the contribution, the company faced operational challenges. Sales volumes fell by 14%, largely due to weaker consumer spending and broader macroeconomic headwinds. Revenue also declined by 28%, dropping from US$18.1 million to US$13 million compared to the same period last year. The fall was attributed to constrained consumer incomes, a tough trading environment, and a shift in pricing strategy from ZWG to US$.\n\nCosts, however, moved in the opposite direction. The cost of sales rose by 31%, climbing to US$4.1 million from US$3.4 million in 2024, driven mainly by higher raw material prices.\n\nDespite these pressures, BAT recorded a profit before tax of US$6.6 million, a marked recovery from the US$10.6 million loss posted during the same period last year.\n\nZimbabwes ability to navigate the ever-changing macro-economic landscape and deliver long-term value to all stakeholders.

However, his legal team claims the charges are fabricated by rivals seeking to force him out, using the names of influential politicians to strengthen their plot.\n\nIn a letter dated September 30, 2025, and seen byNewZimbabwe.com, Mushanawanis lawyer Admire Rubaya argued that the arrest was unlawful, describing his client as being punished for doing things right at the parastatal.\n\nRubaya alleged that ZACC had been misled, insisting that all the CEOs actions were above board and backed by board approval, contrary to claims that he engaged companies without authorisation.\n\nThere are certain individuals who are targeting his post who have approached you (ZACC) on the basis of name dropping very powerful individuals who sit in the high echelons of power and politics in this country yet there is no involvement of any such political figures. The grand plan is for these instigators to take over as the people at the helm of NetOne, the letter states.\n\nZACC accuses Mushanawani of breaching company procedures by secretly engaging Lunartech Solutions (Pvt) Ltd to upgrade NetOnes SAGE 1000 system, which was meant to be replaced under a separate US$3.5 million contract awarded to Farevic Systems (Pvt) Ltd in 2022.\n\nThe commission alleges that Mushanawani did so without the approval of the Executive Committee or the Board.\n\nHowever, his lawyers insist the upgrade was necessary, approved at the board level, and vital to safeguard NetOnes operations.\n\nOur client is at a loss as to why he finds himself languishing in police custody over an issue which exposes your officers lack of understanding of IT systems, the lawyers wrote.\n\nThey explained that the SAP ERP system being implemented by Farevic was distinct from the SAGE 1000 system NetOne had been using for years. SAGE had reached its end-of-sale stage, with support from its South African vendor scheduled to end on December 31, 2024, creating what they said was a significant operational risk.\n\nContrary to your claims, the upgrading of the SAGE ERP 1000 to SAGE L200 was imperative  This was key and had been approved by the board, the lawyers said.\n\nThey further argued that both systems had to run in parallel until the new one was proven fully functional.\n\nThe lawyers also rejected claims that Mushanawani signed addenda worth US$1.2 million to upgrade the SAGE system.\n\nThis is false, and you are challenged to provide such evidence. For your information, the only payments which have been made thus far are for US$184,800 and US$88,002.57, the letter reads.\n\nThey equally dismissed allegations that Mushanawani entered into an unapproved consultancy contract with Diztech (Pvt) Ltd for US$79,467.\n\nFor the record, there is no contract that was signed between Diztech (Pvt) Ltd and NetOne as alleged, neither has there been any payment of even a dime to Diztech (Pvt) Ltd  since no such services were ever provided, the lawyers said.\n\nMushanawanis defence team maintains that the allegations are part of a deliberate campaign to oust him from his position. They attached board documents to support their case and warned ZACC against being used in what they called an orchestrated plot.\n\n",

If he maintains that manhood, he will not have the discipline to stop. As women, we live in fear,where can we safely keep our children when we go to work, to church, or even here in Parliament? she asked, drawing applause across the House.\n\nNyamupinga stressed that prison sentences alone were insufficient, since many offenders re-offend upon release.\n\nIf you decide it is not good to cut off his manhood, then let us castrate them, she insisted.\n\nActing Speaker of Parliament Joseph Tshuma acknowledged the gravity of the issue, condemning the sexual abuse of minors as incomprehensible and appalling.\n\nHe suggested that Nyamupinga consider introducing a Private Members Bill to push for harsher penalties, including possible life sentences for child rapists.\n\nWhile Zimbabwe has abolished the death penalty, certain crimes, particularly the rape of minors, demand severe consequences, the Acting Speaker said.\n\n",

These challenges resulted in the Groups operational capacity being impacted negatively, said Nkala.\n\nThe company carried out a comprehensive impairment review of all cash-generating units (CGUs). Due to constrained operational capacity, it recognised an impairment of US$10.3 million, as the recoverable amounts of certain CGUs fell below their carrying values.\n\nA net exchange gain of US$13.5 million was recorded, stemming from the revaluation of monetary liabilities after the devaluation of the Zimbabwe Gold (ZWG).\n\nDespite the challenges, the group has taken steps to strengthen its balance sheet. A rights issue raising US$20 million was concluded in July 2025, with proceeds received in August. An additional capital raise of US$10.5 million through the sale of immovable properties is underway, with offers currently under consideration.\n\nLooking ahead, cost optimisation and in-store as well as online sales strategies will remain central to achieving and sustaining the required growth. The recovery of the Group has started, but it will take some time to return to normal operations, added Nkala.\n\n",

The gang stole cellphones and laptops and attempted to break into an administration block at one of the schools around 3 am.\n\nThe on-duty security guard became suspicious and confronted the suspects. Police said the suspects opened fire in the guards direction before fleeing.\n\nThe guard later discovered one of the suspects lying on the ground with a gunshot wound.
