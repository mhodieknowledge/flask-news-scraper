            "content": "By Sports Reporter\n\nMWOS FC head coach Lloyd Mutasa says his teams lack of squad depth cost them the 2025 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League title, despite an impressive campaign that saw themat thetop of the logfor several weeks.\n\nThe Norton-based side currently sits third on the log with 55 points, six behind leaders Scottland FC, with only three matches remaining in the season.\n\nMWOS FCs faint title hopes were dashed last Saturday after a 1-0 loss to rivals Scottland FC, a result that effectively ended their championship pursuit.\n\nDespite falling short, MWOS have enjoyed a remarkable debut season in the top flight  spending more than ten weeks at the summit and going on a 16-match unbeaten run.\n\nReflecting on the campaign, Mutasa said the teams lack of adequate preparation before the season began played a major role in their late slip.\n\nFoundation is important. You know, pre-season and the kind of players you recruit will determine how you play, said Mutasa.\n\nThese guys punched above their weight because, if you look at our depth compared to other teams, there is a huge difference. We tried as much as we could, but we only stretched this far.\n\nMWOS FCs promotion to the Premier Soccer League was confirmed in February 2025, barely a month before the new season began. The club had finished second to Scottland in the Northern Region Division One League, and secured its top-flight berth by purchasing ZPC Hwanges PSL status.\n\nMutasa said the team is now focused on winning the Chibuku Super Cup, aiming to cap off their impressive season with silverware.\n\nMWOS face Triangle United in the semi-finals of the tournament at Ngoni Stadium on Saturday. Victory would see them progress to the final, where they will meet either Dynamos or Highlanders.\n\nConsidering the efforts put in place by management and our fans, I think we will try as much as possible to win the Chibuku Super Cup, as hard as it might be, added Mutasa.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTigere Property Fund (Tigere REIT) has announced plans to expand its portfolio through the acquisition of two prime retail properties, the Greenfields Retail Centre and Phase 1 of the Zimre Park Retail Centre, for a combined value of approximately US$25.1 million.\n\nThe REIT said the proposed acquisitions are subject to unitholder approval and will be fully funded through the issuance of 770.5 million new Tigere REIT units.\n\nThis marks Tigere REITs second acquisition since its initial public offering (IPO), following the successful purchase of Highland Park Phase 2. The move aligns with the funds strategy of securing high-quality, income-generating real estate assets supported by long-term, US dollar-denominated leases, a key driver for stable returns and capital growth.\n\nThe total acquisition consideration reflects the combined net asset value (NAV) of the target properties. Upon completion, Tigere REITs total units in issue will increase to 1.84 billion, with the newly issued units representing 41.8% of the enlarged unit base.\n\nThe implied issuance price per unit for the transaction stands at US$3.26 cents, representing a 2.536% premium over Tigere REITs NAV per unit of US$3.18 as of June 30, 2025.\n\nThe bulk of the transaction involves the Greenfields Retail Centre, acquired on a leasehold basis. The property, whose development began in December 2024, features 54 tenants across 14,000m of gross lettable area (GLA) and is currently fully occupied.\n\nTigere REIT said the acquisitions will further strengthen its portfolio of high-quality retail assets, supporting consistent returns and sustainable long-term growth for investors.\n\n",
