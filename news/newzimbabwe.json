            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nIN a grotesque tribute yesterday, President Emmerson Mnangagwa paid a solemn tribute to commemorate the sixth anniversary of the passing of former president Robert Mugabe, whom he ousted through a military-assisted operation in 2017.\n\nMugabe, Zimbabwes founding post-independence leader, died in Singapore on September 6, 2019, two years following his removal from office by Mnangagwa and his Lacoste faction, which fought a bitter succession battle against the Generation 40 faction fronted by wife Grace Mugabe, Saviour Kasukuwere, Walter Mzembi, Jonathan Moyo and Patrick Zhuwawo.In his commemorative message, Mnangagwa praised Mugabe as a freedom fighter par excellence, a veteran nationalist, and revered frontline Statesman.Today, the 6th September, 2025, His Excellency the President E.D. Mnangagwa, the Party and Government join the former First Family and the entire nation in commemorating the passing on of the late First Executive President of Zimbabwe, Cde Robert Gabriel Mugabe, said Mnangagwa.A freedom fighter par excellence, and veteran nationalist, the late Cde R.G. Mugabe, was a revered Frontline Statesman who fearlessly championed the political and economic emancipation of Southern Africa and continent of Africa.Born on February 21, 1924, Mugabe endured 11 years imprisonment at the hands of the settler colonial regime before emerging in 1975 to lead Zanu in a protracted war of independence from bases in Mozambique.Mugabe prosecuted the armed struggle, known as the Second Chimurenga/Umvukela, culminated in Zimbabwes independence in 1980.Mnangagwa described Mugabe as a true son of the soil and iconic liberation fighter, whose political astuteness shaped the First Republic.Among his landmark legacies, the Land Reform Programme redefined land ownership patterns, addressing historic injustices of colonial dispossession.His indigenisation and economic empowerment policies sought to restore dignity, self-belief, and resilience to Zimbabweans, even in the face of illegal sanctions, the 82-year-old Zanu PF leader said.Himself a beneficiary of Mugabes benevolence, Mnangagwa added that in the social sphere, Mugabe broadened access to education and healthcare for the once marginalised majority blacks.In recognition of this, Mnangagwa said, the Second Republic established a National Honours and Awards category in his name, dedicated to human capital development.Mnangagwa equated Mugabe to fallen continental giants such as Julius Nyerere, Jomo Kenyatta, Kenneth Kaunda, Samora Machel, Agostino Neto, Sam Nujoma, Joshua Nkomo, and Nelson Mandela.He was a fervent Pan-Africanist who dedicated his life to fighting apartheid, promoting African renaissance, and advancing the cause of the downtrodden across the world, Mnangagwa said.As we remember our late President, the Second Republic once again re-dedicates itself to preserving the legacy of Cde R.G. Mugabe by winding up the successful National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1) and preparing NDS2 guided by the goal to have a society that is free, democratic and prosperous, which leaves no-one and no place behind through inclusive development, he added.Mnangagwa noted that his Zanu PF party and government commit to iconic Mugabes enduring mantra that Zimbabwe will never be a colony again.\n\nMugabe, Zimbabwes founding post-independence leader, died in Singapore on September 6, 2019, two years following his removal from office by Mnangagwa and his Lacoste faction, which fought a bitter succession battle against the Generation 40 faction fronted by wife Grace Mugabe, Saviour Kasukuwere, Walter Mzembi, Jonathan Moyo and Patrick Zhuwawo.\n\nIn his commemorative message, Mnangagwa praised Mugabe as a freedom fighter par excellence, a veteran nationalist, and revered frontline Statesman.Today, the 6th September, 2025, His Excellency the President E.D.

These reviews are guided by the need to improve the welfare of educators while maintaining fiscal sustainability, he said.\n\nIn addition to salary adjustment, Moyo said the government has introduced several non-monetary incentives including provision of land for housing development, duty-free vehicle importation facility, access to the Government Employees Mutual Savings (GEMS) scheme and ongoing efforts to expand institutional accommodation.\n\nThe ministry continues to engage with relevant stakeholders to explore more innovative ways of cushioning teachers from economic pressures including school-based incentives supported through local communities and responsible authorities, he added.\n\nZimbabwe is one of the few countries, which does not meaningfully reward its teachers and civil servants.\n\nA June 2021 report stated that, comparing with other regional countries, Zimbabwean teachers got way below their peers. In Namibia, tutors earned 24,000 Namibian dollars per month, equivalent to about US$1,759 at that time. In Botswana, teachers salaries range from 5,970 to 22,700 Botswana Pula per month while Lesothos average salary in 2024 was around 11,800 Lesotho Loti (LSL) per month, or about $792.\n\n",

He charged at you and you felt threatened. Your use of a log was, however, disproportionate You were therefore negligent.The court heard that Khumalo is a first offender, left school at Grade 7 due to poverty, and now looks after his sick mother and his late brothers daughter. His mother begged the court for mercy in an emotional plea.The person you killed is your own brother. You will live with this tragic incident for the rest of your life. The mental imprisonment far exceeds the imprisonment which comes with the four corners of a prison cell, Kabasa said.While warning that violence does not solve anything and reminding society to respect the sanctity of life, the judge suspended a three-year prison term for five years.You deserve a second chance, Justice Kabasa ruled.\n\nDelight Khumalo (24) struck his brother twice on the head with a 1.55kg, 186cm log during a midnight scuffle after the deceased stormed into their 60-year-old mothers bedroom hut at 3am, threatening violence.\n\nThe victim later died in hospital from severe brain trauma.Khumalo pleaded guilty to culpable homicide, admitting responsibility but denying intent to kill.Justice Evangelista Kabasa, sitting with two assessors, agreed that now deceaseds actions fuelled violence.The deceased was aggressive and would not listen to your mother.
