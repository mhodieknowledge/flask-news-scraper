And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.Let us take this scripture to heart and come together in earnest prayer for our leaders.Our local leadership has been making efforts to address the needs of our vulnerable and underprivileged communities.

Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.We must pray that our leaders are granted the wisdom and discernment to see the struggles of the people they serve, especially in our rural areas where the affliction of hunger is most prevalent and severe.THANKSGIVING FOR EFFORTS MADELet us also take a moment to express our gratitude for the efforts already made by our government and local authorities. They are striving to provide for their people, and we commend them for this. However, it is clear that more needs to be done.We must uplift our leaders in prayer, asking God to inspire them to increase their feeding initiatives and ensure that every resident has access to the food they need.A PRAYER FOR OUR LEADERSHIPHeavenly Father, we come before You with heavy hearts. We lift up our leaders in Zimbabwe and ask that You grant them the vision to see the plight of those who are hungry and in need. We thank You for the efforts they have made so far, but we humbly request that You empower them to do more.May they find new ways to support the vulnerable and underprivileged, and may Your abundance flow through them to nourish our people. We ask these things in the powerful name of Jesus Christ.AMEN.As we leave today, let us carry this message of prayer and hope in our hearts.

And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.\n\nLet us take this scripture to heart and come together in earnest prayer for our leaders.Our local leadership has been making efforts to address the needs of our vulnerable and underprivileged communities.

The pollution challenges facing this lake requires a whole-of-government and whole-of-society approach, therefore, we urge the public and relevant authorities to understand the effects of pollution and to join us in advocating for better environmental practices to protect our biodiversity, Farawo said.Zimbabwe has the fourth largest population of rhinos in Africa.

He later told the businessperson that he had been robbed of the money, said NyathiA deeper probe revealed that in order for Sibanda to bolster his credibility, he initiated sales processes with various owners and even hired private security for cash-in-transit services.Further investigations by the police revealed that the suspect approached several businesspeople, private security companies and property owners, claiming that he had a lot of cash and wanted to buy residential and business premises in Harare.To gain credibility, the suspect initiated the sale process with some of the owners and even hired private security companies for cash-in-transit services, said the police spokesman.Nyathi also added that, The suspects goal in faking robbery was to exploit the victims sympathy and manipulate them into giving him money.\n\nThe incident occurred in Harare on December 11, 2024, wherein the allegedly stolen car was found dumped in Mutoko.\n\nIn a statement, the ZRP national spokesperson, Commissioner Paul Nyathi, said during investigations it was established that Sibanda faked the robbery.Investigations by the police established that the robbery incident was false, and the suspect had travelled to Mutoko by public transport after producing an identification card from a local bus company.Upon arrival, he phoned a Mutoko business owner claiming that he wanted to buy his garage in Adbennie for US$900 000.

Theres one called Chinamano, and it is now 20 years without electricity connection.\n\nI have been challenging the government over this issue of lack of electricity because children are failing to learn ICT materials such as computers as a result of the lack of electricity, said Mhetu.\n\nThe government has been promoting ICT tools to enhance education in the era of Artificial Intelligence (AI).\n\nThe model being pursued by government, Education 5.0, is anchored on community service, research, innovation, and industrialisation. However, there are concerns that some disadvantaged schools are being left out in digitalisation due to lack of electricity.\n\nMhetu said engagement with national power utility, Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA), have yielded discouraging results.\n\nThe power utility has quoted exorbitant fees, exceeding US$100 000 for connecting these schools to the grid.\n\nI approached ZESA and they indicated that they do not have money to power these schools. They gave us a quotation of US$17 000, US$65 000 and another one is US$70 000 for three schools. These are huge figures, lamented the parliamentarian.\n\n",
