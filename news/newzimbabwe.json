I did not take or grab any land as alluded to, said Matewu.\n\n",

These educators are being persecuted not for misconductbut for courageously organising and demanding fair wages that reflect the dignity of their labour, ARTUZ noted.\n\nIt is appalling that instead of engaging meaningfully with the AUTs legitimate demand for the restoration of pre-October 2018 salaries pegged at US$2,500, UZ management has chosen to weaponise disciplinary processes to intimidate and punish union leaders, the union added.\n\nThe suspensions, the labour body went further, were a direct assault on workers rights, academic freedom, and the constitutional right to freedom of association.\n\nARTUZ condemned the suspensions, describing them as an anti-worker, authoritarian attempt to suppress labour organising in the higher education sector.\n\nThe demand for living wages is not riotousit is righteous. The balloting exercise held by AUT reflects democratic principles, not disruption. If anything, it is managements refusal to address salary erosion that is disrupting higher learning.\n\nWe remind authorities that education cannot thrive in an environment where educators are punished for demanding fair treatment. This attack on AUT is an attack on all educators across the country, ARTUZ said.\n\nTo our colleagues in AUT, we say: You are not alone. Your fight is our fight. Your resilience is an inspiration to every underpaid and overworked teacher across Zimbabwe.\n\nARTUZ demanded that the vice chancellor and his executive immediately reverse the suspensions and engage AUT in good faith. The union also appealed to the Higher and Tertiary Education Ministry to intervene and protect the rights of tutors.\n\n",

Under this policy, blood donors who have given blood ten times or more, with their last donation made within the past 12 months, are entitled to free blood for their biological parents, children, or spouse should they require a blood transfusion.\n\nNBSZ is committed to doing whatever it takes to ensure that blood donors are well-catered for, the statement reads.\n\nAlthough the government maintains that blood is always available free of charge to patients in public hospitals, the situation on the ground tells a different story.\n\nMany public hospitals, including Parirenyatwa, Zimbabwes largest referral hospital, do not consistently offer free blood transfusions.\n\nIn many instances, patients are simply told to purchase blood themselves, as it is often unavailable at the hospitals.\n\nNBSZ said that the costs associated with blood are not for the blood itself, but rather for the necessary processes involved in preparing it for safe use.\n\nIt is important to understand that once blood is donated, it does not go directly for transfusion. Instead, it undergoes rigorous testing for infections, blood grouping, separation into components, safe storage and then distribution. These processes require advanced equipment, skilled scientific personnel, specialized storage facilities and strict adherence to international safety standards.\n\nAs a non-profit organization, NBSZ strives to recover only the operational costs associated with these processes, while ensuring that blood products remain accessible and affordable to all individuals who require transfusion, NBSZ added.\n\n",

The trajectory was sustained in March 2025 when the ZWG inflation declined to settle at-0,1%.\n\nWhile a fall in prices is generally desirable, deflation can also result in adverse consequences to the economy if it is sustained. It can drive down spending, investment and impede economic growth. Thus, it is advisable for the authorities to keep an eye on inflation so that sustained deflation would signal increasing liquidity into the economy, he said.\n\nThe industry lobby group said to some extent a month-on-month inflation rate of  0.1% indicates that the monetary authorities tight monetary policy stance is paying off.\n\nProducts that registered the lowest inflation included gas, which registered the lowest inflation rate of about -6%.\n\nAlso making it to the top five on the lowest inflation rates are electrical appliances for personal care(-4%), other services (-3%), books (-3%) and stationery (-3%).\n\nThe industry lobby group said US$ monthly declined to 0.1% in March 2025, representing a 0,1% drop from February 2025s rate of 0.2%, attributable to both US$ and ZiG month-on-month inflation rates decreased.\n\nThe US$ year-on-year inflation for the month of March declined to 15%, which was a 0.1 percentage point drop from 15.1% in February 2025.

The bonds, issued last week, can be sold and held by other market players including pension funds, before their maturity date, he said.\n\nThe Compensation Steering Committees Chairperson and former Commercial Farmers Union President Andrew Pascoe confirmed receipt of the payments. The former farm owners received dollar payments on March 24, he added.\n\nThe payment is the latest attempt to resolve the decades-long dispute triggered by former Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe encouraging veterans of the liberation war to evict farmers and their workers from their land in a bid to win support in a close-fought election in 2000. By 2002, at least seven White farmers had been killed alongside dozens of their workers, Human Rights Watch said.\n\nThat contributed to sanctions being imposed on Zimbabwean politicians by the US, UK and the European Union leading to the southern African nations protracted fallout with the West.\n\nZimbabwe, also has a history of not paying its debts. It has been locked out of international capital markets since 1999 after it defaulted on debt from lenders including the World Bank, Paris Club and African Development Bank.\n\nIn February, Zimbabwe began paying compensation to five nations namely Denmark, Germany, Netherlands, Switzerland and the former Yugoslavia and to 56 foreign nationals who despite having their farms protected under bilateral agreements had them seized. The compensation is a crucial step demanded by foreign creditors as the southern African nation seeks to restructure its debt. Zimbabwe owes 57% of its $21 billion debt pile to external creditors.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe (MCAZ) has warned against the unauthorized advertising of unapproved medicines, particularly by social media influencers and celebrities.\n\nMCAZ has noted and observed this trend on platforms like Facebook, WhatsApp, and X (formerly Twitter), raising significant concerns for public health.\n\nIn a statement, the MCAZ, Director General, Richard Rukwata said such practices violate the Medicines and Allied Substances Control Act (Chapter 15:03), and it prohibits any person from advertising any medicine without prior written approval from the Authority.\n\nThis is in contravention of Section 40 of the Medicines and Allied Substances Control Act (Chapter 15:03) (hereinafter referred to as the Act) and Section 65 of the Medicines and Allied Substances Control (General) Regulations, 1991, (S.I. 150 of 1991) (hereinafter referred to as the Regulations). Section 40 of the Act prohibits the publication or distribution of false or misleading advertisements for medicines, stipulating that those requiring professional direction for use may only be advertised in approved medical journals or healthcare professionals.\n\nAdditionally, Section 65(1b) states that No person shall advertise any other medicine without the approval of the Authority in writing whilst Section 65(3) states that No person shall advertise any medicine to members of the public in terms calculated to lead to its use for the treatment of human beings for any of the conditions set out in the Seventh Schedule, said Rukwata.\n\nRukwata, outlined several ways in which the public can easily identify authorized advertisements by the MCAZ.\n\nMedicines that have been approved for use typically display a unique registration number, which is assigned after evaluation of their safety and efficacy. Members of the public can easily verify this registration number by checking the medicines register on the MCAZ website.\n\nBe cautious of advertisements making unrealistic claims, such as promises of instant results, 100% cure rates, or zero side effects, as these are often deceptive. Reliable advertisements should be informative, balanced, and up to date, with claims that can be substantiated.\n\nBe cautious of advertisements that make unsubstantiated claims of being better than other brands, as these claims are often unfounded and misleading. Prescription medicines should not be advertised for direct sale to the public. If an advertisement encourages buying a prescription medicine without consulting your medical practitioner, it is likely unapproved.\n\nIf one medicine claims to cure multiple diseases, from diabetes to cancer, it is likely a scam. Advertisements that use language intended to create fear or distress should be treated with caution. Advertisements for medicines in connection with any bonus offer or discount, he added.\n\nThe Authority, working with the Zimbabwe Republic Police, will take necessary measures, including prosecution, should anyone contravene these provisions. We urge members of the public, socialites, celebrities, and influencers to desist from advertising medicines without written approval from the MCAZ.\n\nAn advertisement, according to the Act in relation to any medicine, means any written, pictorial, visual, or other descriptive matter or verbal statement or reference (a) appearing in any newspaper or other publication; or (b) appearing on any television or cinematograph film; or (c) distributed to members of the public; or (d) brought to the notice of members of the public in any manner whatsoever, which is intended to promote the sale of that medicine; Contravention of the above provisions is an offence which may attract penalties in terms of both the Act and the Regulations.\n\n",
