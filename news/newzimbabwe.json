The figure only covers the most essential medicines.\n\nThe availability of essential medicines increased from 22% in 2023 to around 50% in 2024. The increase in availability has largely been due to greater investment in medicines.\n\nFor instance, there are currently two main medicine supply contracts: Intrapharma (around US$24 million) and Clean Planet (around US$17 million).\n\nIn 2023, the government allocated about US$52 million for medicines. In 2025, the government committed approximately US$44 million toward medicines.\n\nThere are ongoing negotiations with the Treasury to increase the health budget in light of dwindling external support, Mombeshora said.\n\nZimbabwes health sector is generally underfunded and relies heavily on the benevolence of Western development partners.\n\n",

            "content": "A federal judge has ordered half a dozen federal agencies to immediately reinstate probationary employees fired last month as part of the Trump administrations effort to rapidly shrink the federal workforce, calling the effort a sham.\n\nThe preliminary injunction issued from the bench Thursday by US District Judge William Alsup requires the departments of Veterans Affairs, Agriculture, Defense, Energy, Interior and Treasury to rehire the employees. The judge said that he might extend the order to cover other federal agencies at a later time.\n\nAlsup, an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, said he was making the ruling because he believes the Office of Personnel Management unlawfully directed the agencies earlier this year to lay off the probationary employees, who generally have been on the job for less than a year.\n\nThe judge said the order is effective immediately: This is the order and it counts.\n\nThe Justice Department indicated Thursday that it will appeal the ruling to the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\nThe ruling came in a case brought by labor unions and others challenging OPMs role in the firings, which affected thousands of employees and sent shockwaves through various federal agencies, some of which later rehired some of the workers.\n\nAlsup was highly critical of the administrations justification for firing the employees. OPM had provided agencies with a template termination letter that cited the employees performance as the reason they were being let go. But the judge said that rationale was the governments attempt to end-run federal law setting up specific rules for reducing the federal workforce.\n\nThe reason that OPM wanted to put this based on performance was at least in part in my judgment a gimmick to avoid the Reductions in Force Act, the judge said. Because the law always allows you to fire somebody for performance.\n\nIt is a sad day when our government would fire some good employee and say it was based on performance when they know good and well thats a lie, he added. That should not have been done in our country. It was a sham in order to try to avoid statutory requirements.\n\nFederal probationary employees have typically been in their positions for one year, but some jobs have two-year probationary periods. The employees may be new to the federal workforce, but they also could have been recently promoted or shifted to a different agency.\n\nAlsups ruling is one of the most significant yet in cases testing the administrations authority to quickly reduce the number of federal employees  a key priority that has been central to the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency.\n\nThe White House called the ruling absurd and unconstitutional.\n\nA single judge is attempting to unconstitutionally seize the power of hiring and firing from the Executive Branch. The President has the authority to exercise the power of the entire executive branch  singular district court judges cannot abuse the power of the entire judiciary to thwart the Presidents agenda, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statementposted on X by another White House aide.\n\nIf a federal district court judge would like executive powers, they can try and run for President themselves, Leavitt said.\n\nA second federal judgeruled later Thursday, in a similar case brought in Maryland by Democratic state attorneys general, that probationary employees laid off en masse by the Trump administration must be temporarily reinstated. That judges temporary restraining order, which will last two weeks, applies to 18 agencies, including the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental Protection Agency and the US Agency for International Development.\n\nThe preliminary injunction came after Alsup unloaded on the Justice Department for not making the acting head of the Office of Personnel Management available to testify about the Trump administrations decision to fire scores of probationary employees.\n\nHe had ordered acting OPM Director Charles Ezell to testify during Thursdays hearing, where he would likely face tough questions from attorneys representing the labor unions that are challenging his agencys role in the firings.\n\nBut the Justice Department refused to make him available and instead withdrew a declaration Ezell submitted last month that had served as the governments only evidence in the case.\n\nYoure afraid to do so because you know cross-examination will reveal the truth, Alsup told DOJ attorney Kelsey Helland. I tend to doubt that youre telling me the truth.\n\nAlsup told the DOJ attorney Thursday: You cant just say, heres a declaration, you have to accept it without question when there is a question.\n\nYoure not helping me get at the truth. Youre giving me press releases  sham documents, the judge said, referring to documents submitted by the DOJ to the court that they say shows how the agencies were making the termination decisions themselves.\n\nThe declaration from Ezell said that OPM did not direct other agencies to terminate probationary employees  the central issue in the case brought by labor unions and others.\n\nHelland pushed back strongly on the judges assertion, and argued during the hearing that the agency heads had sought to cull their workforce on their own, not at the direction of OPM.\n\nI respectfully disagree that we have submitted false evidence, he said at one point, adding later: Decisions on these employment actions were made by these agencies and were fully endorsed by their political leadership.\n\nThe Trump administration has been targeting probationary workers because they have fewer job protections and can be dismissed more easily. While they generally cannot appeal their termination to the Merit Systems Protection Board, they can if the action stemmed from partisan political reasons or marriage status. Also, they are protected from prohibited personnel practices.\n\nPart of Thursdays hearing concerned whether the employees at issue in the case have the option of appealing their firing to the MSPB, something Alsup had initially understood was possible. But the judge said he wanted the parties to submit more written legal arguments on the issue before he decides how to factor it into his ruling.\n\nOne former probationary employee who wasfired last monthfrom the IRS, an agency within the Treasury Department, told CNN that he and his colleagues were thrilled with the ruling.\n\nEveryone on the group chat is celebrating, the former IRS employee said, referring to a text chat where his former colleagues have been consoling each other in recent weeks.\n\n",

And I personally have always felt unworthy, like I was a fraud, like when people told me I deserve something.\n\nIt made me feel sneaky, like, damn, if they only knew my thoughts.

I definitely feel unequipped and unqualified most days.\n\nBieber first found fame aged 15 after being discovered on YouTube and signing to his friend and mentorUshersrecord label.\n\nHis debut single Baby was released in 2010, catapulting him to international stardom.\n\nSince then, he has become one of the worlds best-selling music artists, with an estimated 150 million records sold globally.\n\nSpeculation over his health has intensified in recent months following appearances where he looked unkempt, prompting his representative to deny claims he was using hard drugs.\n\nDespite the speculation, Bieber and his wife,Hailey Bieber, 28, who share a seven-month-old son, Jack Blues, have continued to present a united front.\n\nThe couple has been seen together in public and on social media, including a post on March 1, celebrating Justins 31st birthday.\n\nHowever, concerns were reignited days later when the singer shared images of himself smoking from what appeared to be a bong.\n\nThe photos, posted to Instagram, showed him sitting on an e-bike with Cypress Hills Hits from the Bong playing in the background.\n\nLast month, Justins representative addressed concerns over his appearance, saying in a statement: The recurring narrative that Justin is using hard drugs is absolutely not true.\n\n",

With respect to one employee, Combs used physical force, psychological harm, financial harm and reputational harm, and /or threats of the same to cause the employee to engage in sex acts with Combs.\n\nCombs is scheduled to be arraigned on the new indictment next week.\n\nHe has previously pleaded not guilty to racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution charges and is scheduled to go on trial this spring.\n\nFederal prosecutors said they do not expect the new indictment to affect the May 5 trial.\n\nThe music mogul was arrested in September 2024 and remains in custody in the federal Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn.\n\nCombs is accused of transporting prostitutes across state lines to engage in prolonged sexual activities known as freak offs, according to court filings.\n\nHe has denied all allegations made against him.\n\nMr. Combs has said it before and will say it again: he vehemently denies the accusations made by the SDNY [Southern District of New York], his attorney, Marc Agnifilo, said in a statement on Thursday in response to the superseding indictment. He looks forward to his day in court when it will become clear that he has never forced anyone to engage in sexual acts against their will.\n\n",
