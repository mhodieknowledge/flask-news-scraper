            "content": "BBC\n\nDisturbing videos have emerged showing the dire situation at a disused gold mine in South Africa where scores of illegal miners have reportedly been living underground for months.\n\nThey have been there since police operations targeting illicit mining started last year across the country.\n\nIn one of the videos, which the BBC has not independently verified, corpses wrapped in makeshift body bags can be seen. A second shows the emaciated figures of some miners who are still alive.\n\nA long-delayed rescue operation, that last week a court ordered the government to facilitate, is continuing for a second day after beginning on Monday.\n\nLast year, arguing that the miners had entered the shaft in Stilfontein deliberately without permission, the authorities took a hard line, blocking food and water supplies.\n\nIn November, one government minister said: We are going to smoke them out.\n\nMore than 100 of the illegal miners, known locally as zama zamas, have reportedly died underground since the crack down began at the mine some 145km (90 miles) south-west of Johannesburg.\n\nThe authorities however, have not confirmed this figure as it is yet to be verified by an official source, a spokesperson told the BBC.\n\nHundreds are thought to be still in the mine while more than 1,000 have surfaced in the past few months.\n\nIn one of the videos released by a trade union, the General Industries Workers of South Africa (Giwusa), dozens of shirtless men can be seen sitting on a dirty floor. Their faces have been blurred. A male voice off camera can be heard saying that the men are hungry and need help.\n\nWere starting to show you the bodies of those who died underground, he says.\n\nAnd this is not all of them Do you see how people are struggling? Please we need help.\n\nIn the other video, a man says: This is hunger; people are dying because of hunger. He then puts the death toll at 96 and begs for help, food and supplies.\n\nThe union says the footage was filmed on Saturday.\n\nIn a briefing held on Monday near the site of the rescue operation, Giwusa leadership, alongside community figures, said the videos shared painted a very dire picture of the situation underground.\n\nWhat has transpired here has to be called what it is; this is a Stilfontein massacre. Because what this footage does is show a pile of human bodies, of miners that died needlessly, Giwusa president Mametlwe Sebei said.\n\nHe blamed the authorities for what he described as a treacherous policy that was deliberately pursued.\n\nThe department of mineral resources, leading the rescue effort, told the BBC that Mondays operation included lowering down a cage that is then hoisted up once loaded with people.\n\nThis structure is designed to hold six or seven people, depending on their weight, according to Giwusa. It has been going down the shaft  descending about 2km  every hour. The union said that by the end of Monday 26 miners had been brought up alive, along with nine bodies.\n\nDepartment of mineral resources spokesperson Makhosonke Buthelezi could not confirm whether the priority will be to retrieve those who had died or those in need of medical attention.\n\nA briefing will be held by the department, together with the police ministry, on Tuesday to provide an update on the operation.\n\n",

Firstly money was not circulating as it should,making it difficult to have proper preparations for the children, said Chitemere.\n\nHarare was a hive of activity Monday as parents made last-minute preparations for the reopening of schools.\n\nStationery and uniform shops were abuzz with parents making a beeline, and some taking advantage to make a killing by hiking the prices of school necessities.\n\nWith big supermarkets short on some goods, many resorted to informal shops in the downtown Harare Central Business Districts to purchase vital school materials.\n\nThe financial strain on some was exacerbated by the just-ended festive season which hit hard the pockets of many.\n\nOne parent identified as Chirisamhuru said the reopening of schools has left him breathing through the wound.\n\nPreparations were not easy. It started during the festive period when we also spent the little that we had. We have sacrificed for my children with one in form six and another one in form two. Essentials were a bit expensive but we did not have an option but to purchase, said Chisiyamhuru.\n\nAs the new yearbegins, Zimbabwes economy continues to tank, picking up where it left in 2024.\n\nAt the heart of the meltdown is the underperforming local currency, Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG), which was introduced nine months ago in an attempt to stabilise the faltering economy.\n\nHowever, ZiG has continued to lose valueagainst the United States dollar with many preferring to transact in the US dollar.\n\nSchools have not been immune to the economic pressures, as many now demand tuition fees in US dollars.\n\nChirisamhuru said the shunning of ZiG by many shops left many, like him,who earn in the local currency in a dilemma.\n\nWe had to reach an agreement with the school to allow kids to go to school after paying a part of the fees and then pay the remaining later. I do not even know ZiG. It is scarce I do not know why maybe it is circulating at RBZ and we are working with what is being demanded, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nWhile South Africa has long been a destination for migrants fleeing economic hardship and drought in Zimbabwe, many arrive to find a harsh reality of poverty, persecution, and xenophobia.\n\nAccording to a recentSky News report, migrants regularly cross through blind spots or use smugglers to navigate the porous border. One migrant openly admitted to crossing illegally, stating, Im not afraid to say this. Im crossing illegally here because theres no immigration or whatever. You cant stop someone suffering.\n\nFor those who make it across, the challenges only multiply. Shelters near the border, such as one for women and children, are filled with stories of despair. Some migrants, like a 14-year-old girl trafficked into South Africa, endure harrowing journeys. They passed through people who were robbing others. Some were taken away, and some were raped, she recounted.\n\nThe situation for men isnt any better. Many travel to Johannesburg only to find themselves trapped in poverty and forced into hijacked buildings. These decrepit structures are rife with overcrowding, inadequate sanitation, and the ever-present threat of fire.\n\nOne resident remarked, Youd rather be in this hijacked building than back home in Zimbabwe. Theres nothing to go back to.\n\nThe migration crisis has fueled xenophobic sentiment across South Africa. Movements like Operation Dudula have gained traction, calling for the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants.\n\nCritics argue that undocumented migrants are straining public resources and competing for jobs in an already struggling economy.
