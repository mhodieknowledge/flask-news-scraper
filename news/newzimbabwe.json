            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has ruled that Simbisa Brands Zimbabwe, the operator of Chicken Inn, Pizza Inn and other fast-food outlets, infringed music copyrights by playing songs without a valid licence from the Zimbabwe Music Rights Association (ZIMURA), but escaped paying nearly US$87,000 in claimed damages after the court found the figure ill-conceived.\n\nJustice Jacob Mafusire delivered the ruling on September 10, 2025, in a case that pitched two rival collecting societies  ZIMURA and the Zimbabwe Council of Copyright Owners (Zimcoco)  against one another, while testing the scope of Zimbabwes Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act.The first defendant violated the copyright in the musical works played at its outlets, Justice Mafusire ruled.Such copyright had been assigned to the plaintiff. It was the plaintiff which had the exclusive right to do what the owner of a copyright is permitted to do in terms of the Act.ZIMURA sued Simbisa Brands for royalties covering November 2023 to October 2024, accusing it of using music by its members  including almost all of Zimbabwes best-known musicians such as Alick Macheso, Jah Prayzah, Nutty O, Winky D, and the late Oliver Mtukudzi  without paying fees. ZIMURA argued that even foreign artists under the CISAC global agreement were affected.The association demanded US$86,719, equivalent to its annual licence fees for Simbisa outlets, and sought a declaration that Zimcoco had no authority to licence songs from ZIMURAs stable.Simbisa countered that it had already paid royalties to Zimcoco, a rival collecting society registered in 2019, and had been assured by the Ministry of Justices Copyright Office that this was sufficient.Zimcoco, for its part, argued it was equally entitled to licence music users, and had lawfully licensed Simbisa.Justice Mafusire dismissed Zimcocos stance, saying registration as a collecting society does not give blanket authority.The issue is not about being registered as a collecting society. It is about who has the copyright in the music played for public consumption, the judge wrote.The second defendant cannot possibly authorise any person to play music that is protected by copyright.However, the court rejected ZIMURAs damages claim, finding that it had simply equated lost royalties to the value of its annual licence without proving actual prejudice suffered by its members.The plaintiffs computation of the amount of its claim and the quantum thereto are ill-conceived, Justice Mafusire said.Works of music by different artists cannot possibly have the same value The quantum bears no relationship to the prejudice allegedly suffered.The court ruled that Zimcoco (the second defendant) cannot authorise anyone to play music protected by copyright.Mafusire also said Simbisa Brands was absolved from the damages claim and also that Zimcoco must pay ZIMURAs costs, while Simbisa and ZIMURA will each bear their own costs.\n\nJustice Jacob Mafusire delivered the ruling on September 10, 2025, in a case that pitched two rival collecting societies  ZIMURA and the Zimbabwe Council of Copyright Owners (Zimcoco)  against one another, while testing the scope of Zimbabwes Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act.\n\nThe first defendant violated the copyright in the musical works played at its outlets, Justice Mafusire ruled.Such copyright had been assigned to the plaintiff.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA FIGHT has erupted on X, (formerly Twitter), between top Harare lawyer Thabani Mpofu and Kuwadzana East Member of Parliament Charlton Hwende.The row saw Hwende taking a swipe at lawyer-cum-politicians, branding political leaders with law backgrounds as unfit for public office, claiming they are obsessed with picking over legal documents.Hwendes jibe indirectly included his former party boss Nelson Chamisa, and one-time fellow party member Fadzayi Mahere, who are both renowned lawyers and political figures.Hwendes remarks came after Mpofu accused President Emmerson Mnangagwa of bending Zanu PFs Constitution with his recent Politburo reshuffle, which saw Obert Mpofu demoted from his position as Secretary General.Nothing in the Zanu PF Constitution vests the First Secretary with the unilateral power to make the reassignments announced. Section 54 is clear on this as it sets out the full remit of his powers. In fact, in terms of section 49 the power to appoint heads is exercised during Congress and not anytime thereafter.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has struck off a multi-million-dollar damages claim brought by Construction Resources Africa against Central African Building & Construction Company (Pvt) Ltd and its former directors, citing inconsistent papers and improper service of summons on defendants now resident in Australia.\n\nIn a judgment handed down on September 5, 2025, Justice Tawanda Chitapi ruled that the plaintiffs application for default judgment could not succeed because its case was riddled with contradictions and fatal procedural flaws.\n\nThe plaintiffs papers are consequently not in order it is not the duty of the court to do a reconciliation of a litigants papers, which are in contest, inconsistent or incongruent with each other, he said.\n\nThe court also found that service of summons on third and fourth defendants, father and son Jose and Luis Viera was defective, since they were peregrines currently residing in Australia and could not have been validly served in Harare.\n\nThere was therefore no proper service of summons and declaration on the third and fourth defendants,Chitapi held.\n\nConstruction Resources Africa had sued the company and the Vieras for over US$5 million in damages, alleging unjust enrichment and unlawful interference in contracts. The claims included US$260,000 for improvements at a Mount Pleasant property, US$36,000 for improvements in Msasa, US$281,000 refund of purchase price and US$125,000 in lost rentals as well as over US$4 million in alleged lost revenue from aborted construction contracts with Chinhoyi University of Technology and the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA).\n\nThe plaintiff also sought declarations that it retained a right of retention over the disputed properties and that the defendants had been unjustly enriched.\n\nHowever, the judge said the case papers lacked clarity, with glaring inconsistencies in the description of the properties involved. The summons referred to 8 Comet Close, Mount Pleasant and 8 Whitesway, Msasa, while the deeds of sale attached to the claim cited entirely different stands in Beverley East.\n\nJustice Chitapi also rebuked defence counsel Mr. T.S. Manjengwa for attempting to address the court on behalf of the first and second defendants, despite them not being parties to the default judgment application.\n\nMr Manjengwa clearly could not get the courts audience, the judge said, noting that under Rule 39(4)(b) of the High Court rules, a barred party cannot appear in judgment proceedings.\n\nIn the end, the judge struck the matter off the roll, stressing that the claim was fundamentally defective.\n\nIn conclusion, the plaintiffs papers are in disorder, and the relief of default judgment is denied, he ruled.\n\nNow Construction Resources Africa will have to regroup and refile if it intends to pursue its claims, prolonging a dispute that has dragged on for years.\n\n",
