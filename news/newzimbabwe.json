Between January and July 2015, one of Mwanandimais bank accounts received nearly R679,000.\n\nLopdale Services and Investments was paid R14.65 million in the period between August 2015 to December 2019, while an additional R396,100 was also transferred.\n\nMwanandimai set up supplier accounts resembling existing ones, directing payments to accounts linked to himself and created a fake employee, who as part of ETUs Discovery Medical Aid Scheme, led to fraudulent contributions totalling R160,845 from September 2017 to April 2020.\n\nETU also paid R239,819 for his medical aid contributions to Bestmed from November 2016 to April 2020, without deducting these amounts from his salary.\n\nETU also covered his cellular phone accounts, with no recovery from his salary and he set up three debit orders on the entitys account.\n\nMwanandimai manipulated bank master data and payroll records to gain unauthorised benefits.\n\nHe initially had viewing rights on the banking system but was subsequently granted payment loading access after he requested further authorisation, according to court papers.\n\nMwanandimais actions were discovered after a new accountant was hired and audited the accounts, and established that he misappropriated over R17m, with about R6.8m, the capital debt, confirmed.\n\nIn September 2020, he acknowledged the use of funds from ETU and confirmed that the amount owed corresponds to the outstanding balance specified in the signed acknowledgment of debt.\n\nThe debtor (Mwanandimai) is truly and lawfully indebted and legally bound to the creditor (ETU) in the amount of six million seven hundred and ninety-seven thousand seven hundred and fifteen rand and sixty cents (R6 797 715.60), reads the acknowledgment of debt.\n\nIn the acknowledgment of debt, he admitted that he stole several millions of rand from ETU and that the total amount stolen was in excess of the capital debt. He did repay certain of the money which he stole.\n\nHis lawyers indicated that he was willing to settle the amount outstanding of R1.777m but could only afford an amount of R100,000 a month due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the July 2021 looting unrest, which has affected his business.\n\nIn a letter dated October 11, 2021, Mwanandimai offered to pay over R10.9m, starting January 31, 2022, over a period of 72 months, which is less than the outstanding balance of R17.1m.\n\nA certificate of balance indicating an amount of R17.1m was issued after all transactions were confirmed by the relevant banks, but Mwanandimai has not made any payments since June 2021.\n\nLast Thursday, Acting Judge Sanet van Aswegen found that Mwanandimai did not manage or disclose his estate with sufficient transparency, and that supporting documentation was provided only at the hearing, despite the prior submission of both an answering affidavit and a supplementary answering affidavit.\n\nIn my considered opinion, the interests of justice are best served by the court exercising its discretion to grant a final sequestration order.\n\nThe issuance of such an order would benefit all the creditors by invoking the pertinent provisions of the Insolvency Act, thereby facilitating an investigation of the estate for their advantage, the acting judge declared.\n\nETU also filed a fraud case with the Yeoville police station in September 2020.\n\nMwanandimais legal representative did not respond to requests for comment while attempts to contact ETU were unsuccessful.\n\n",

            "content": "Jamaicans.com\n\nOn April 17, 1980, reggae icon Bob Marley stepped onto the stage at Rufaro Stadium in Harare to perform at Zimbabwes independence celebration. His songZimbabwerang through the air as a newly free nation celebrated the end of colonial rule. But the story behind the song goes deepershaped by Marleys connection to Africa, the liberation struggle, and a few musical friends in Ethiopia.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Marley frequently visited Ethiopia, drawn by his Rastafarian beliefs and support for African unity. During one visit toAddis Ababa, he was introduced to a group of African musicians working for the United Nations. One of them was a Zimbabwean jazz musician and poet who had formed a band calledThe United Nations Jazz Band. They werent reggae artists, but Marley took interest in their talent and their roots.\n\nThe band and Marley developed a musical friendship. Though coming from different genres, they began to experiment with blending Marleys reggae style with traditional African rhythms. One day, Marley shared that he had been working on a song about Zimbabwes independence. He believed freedom for the country was near and wanted to create something special to support that moment.\n\nThe musicians helped shape the song, bringing in African influencesespecially Shona soundsand Marley welcomed their input. The result wasZimbabwe, a track filled with powerful lyrics like,Every man got a right to decide his own destiny.It was included in Marleys 1979 albumSurvival, which carried strong messages of resistance and African liberation.\n\nWhen Zimbabwes independence was officially declared in April 1980, Marley was invited to perform at the celebration. The new government couldnt afford to pay him, but Marley didnt hesitate. He paid for everything himself, including flying in his band and sound equipment fromLondon.\n\nThat night at Rufaro Stadium, 40,000 people gathered, including world leaders like Prince Charles and Indira Gandhi. As Marley performedZimbabwe, thousands more tried to enter the stadium, and police used tear gas to control the crowd. Still, Marley stayed on stage and kept singing. His commitment to the people never wavered. To make up for those who couldnt see the first concert, he performed again the following nightthis time for over 100,000 people.\n\nMarleys presence meant more than entertainment. He stood with Zimbabwe at a turning point in its history. His performance wasnt just a showit was a statement of unity, freedom, and African pride. His song had become the unofficial anthem of Zimbabwes struggle and victory.\n\nEven after Marleys death in 1981,Zimbabweremains one of his most powerful and politically significant songs. It symbolizes not only a nations independence but also the power of music to inspire and unite people across borders.\n\nFor Zimbabweans, Marleys gift was unforgettablea reggae anthem that echoed their journey, struggles, and hope for the future.\n\n",

            "content": "By Tinashe Mushayavanhu | The Conversation\n\nThe When it comes to African literature, translation has mostly meant translating work from European languages into African ones. Translation from African languages into English has been longoverdue.\n\nNow it appears that a shift in the movement of stories across languages is underway. Works first written and published in African languages areincreasinglybeing translated into English for a broader readership.\n\nCarnelian Heart Publishing/Amabooks\n\nAs ascholarof African literature and publishing, I am optimistic about thelaunchof a new book series called African Language Literatures in Translation by the University of Georgia Press. The series is edited by US-based literary scholarsChristopher OumaandAlexander Fyfe.\n\nThe Madis one of the inaugural titles in the series. Its a translation of Zimbabwean authorIgnatius Mabasas much loved novelMapenzi. The Mad is being jointly released in the UK and Zimbabwe byCarnelian Heart PublishingandamaBooks.\n\nMapenzi is written in Shona, but the ambitious series aims to translate a range of significant African works from other languages too, including Kiswahili and Sesotho.\n\nThis helps shift the terrain of African literature. It allows English readers to encounter African novels as they were first imagined, in the rhythms, idioms, and sensibilities of African languages. It helps counter the erasure of African languages in world literature.\n\nWhen Mabasas debut novel Mapenzi appeared in 1999, it was recognised as a landmark text in Shona literature. Shona is a Bantu language widely spoken in Zimbabwe.\n\nMapenzi tells the story of a disillusioned young war veteran who becomes the uncensored witness to the false promises of independence in Zimbabwe. He witnesses the collapse of social values, and the madness of a society trapped between hope and despair.\n\nThe novels daring style and unruly humour drew comparisons withDambudzo Marechera, Zimbabwes literary provocateur. And with the stylistic innovations ofCharles Mungoshi, the great craftsman of both Shona and English prose.\n\nMabasa is a translator in his own right.Courtesy Ignatius Mabasa\n\nMapenzi was quick to winaccoladesand was adopted as a school text for a generation that came of age at the turn of the millennium. Since then, Mabasa has become a central figure in the promotion of indigenous African writing.\n\nHis commitment and investment was shown when he became thefirst scholarto write and submit a PhD in Shona at Rhodes University in South Africa. Mabasa is also atranslatorin his own right. He mostrecentlyhelped translate Zimbabwean novelist Tsitsi Dangarembgas Nervous Conditions into Shona.\n\nHis career has been a reminder that languages such as Shona are not minor, but vibrant mediums for complex thought and artistic innovation.\n\nNow, more than two decades later, Mapenzican be readin English for the first time.\n\nThe Mad has been translated by J. Tsitsi Mutiti. Unfortunately, there is no information about the translating author in the book. Even a cursory internet search yields little to nothing.\n\nIn works like this, that cross language, culture and geography, the translator plays a crucial role, not just in the texts language but in shaping its tone, context and accessibility. A translators note would have provided insight into the challenges and decisions involved in the process. Instead, the translator and the process of translation remain invisible.\n\nThis lack of acknowledgement overlooks the labour and interpretive skill required to bring such a work to life in another language. The hope is that future editions will correct this omission. Leaving it unaddressed risks diminishing the very cross-cultural understanding that translation seeks to foster.\n\nTranslating Mapenzi is no small task: Mabasas prose brims with poetry, satire and linguistic play. Its cadences are deeply rooted in Shona idiom. The novels innovative structure includes chapters titled after characters, abstract concepts, places and song lyrics, pushing the boundaries of form and style in Shona literature.\n\nIn her translation Mutiti meets this challenge with remarkable skill, sustaining Mabasas lyricism and rhythm without smoothing out its texture. The result is a translation that feels alive, attentive both to the sense and the spirit of the original.\n\nThat said, there are occasional lapses into flatly literal translation, particularly in the dialogue. These moments feel more like direct transpositions from the Shona than deliberate stylistic choices in English. As a result, the translation at times struggles to assert a voice of its own.\n\nNonetheless, the publication of The Mad highlights how translation in African literature is not just a tool for accessibility. It is also a critical, interpretive and archival practice that reshapes the canon, its circulations and readerships. The Mad contributes to African literatures global visibility and intellectual vitality.\n\nFor decades, the global image of African literature has been shaped largely by writers who chose or were compelled to write in colonial languages.\n\nKenyan author and academicNgg wa Thiongo, who recently passed away, has been one of the most famous advocates for writing in African languages. He insisted that the struggle for decolonisation could not be separated from the struggle over language. Yet, as he himself often admitted, African-language writing has remained marginal in the circuits of publishing and translation.\n\nA series like this aims to help change that. Other forthcoming titles include Zanzibari writer Ali Hilal Alis Mmeza Fupa (translatedas The Swallowers of Bones by Meg Arenbeg), Kenyan novelist and sociologist Katama Mkangis Walenisi (translatedas They Are Us by Richard Prins), Lesotho writer and teacher Nteliseng Masechele Khaketlas Left Behind (translated by Makafane Tepang Ntlamelle), and Halfani Sudys Kirusi Kipya (translatedas New Virus by Jay Boss Rubin).\n\nIn this context, The Mad is more than an English version of a Shona classic. It is part of an invitation to rethink what African literature is and where it comes from. Mabasas novel, in Mutitis supple translation, demonstrates how much vitality lies in the vernacular imagination, and how translation can open doors without erasing the local textures of language.\n\nWith The Mad, a new and vital moment begins.\n\nAssistant Professor, Harvard University\n\n",
