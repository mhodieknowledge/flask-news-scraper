Our divisions only serve those who benefit from a weakened working class. We must reclaim the spirit of unity that once made labour the heartbeat of this nation. Because when workers speak with one voice, governments listen, employers tremble, and society begins to shift, said Marimo.He said the truth is that workers in Zimbabwe are under siege and reeling under the pressures of eroded wages, broken social protection which has rendered collective bargaining a ritual without any power.The labour leader bemoaned the huge toll of informality on decent work on the back of the rising debt stock, which he said is further worsened by the huge inequality gap. He said despite pensioners having contributed their all in nation building, they continue to be paid peanuts.If the TNF is to mean anything, it must be a platform of equality, not a rubber stamp for anti-worker policies.

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nZimbabwes pensions sector has demonstrated resilient growth in the first half of 2025, according to the latest report released by the Insurance and Pensions Commission (IPEC).\n\nAs of June 30, 2025, the sectors total assets stood at US$2.63 billion (ZWG70.76 billion), reflecting a 6% increase from US$2.48 billion recorded at the end of March 2025.\n\nThis growth, largely driven by new investments, member contributions, and favourable adjustments in the value of investment properties and equity, signals positive movement for the sector. However, challenges persist, particularly concerning pension contribution arrears and a large proportion of inactive funds, said IPEC.\n\nDespite operating under a relatively stable exchange rate environment, the sectors total income fell sharply by 78.74% to US$295.47 million (ZWG7.87 billion) for the six months to June 2025, down from US$1.39 billion recorded during the same period in 2024.\n\nIPEC attributed the decline to reduced fair value gains, which had previously been buoyed by exchange rate movements.\n\nInvestment performance varied across asset classes. Investment properties, which form a major component of pension fund portfolios, recorded modest growth of 1.75%, increasing to US$1.16 billion (ZWG31.14 billion) from US$1.14 billion in March.\n\nUnquoted equity investments rose by 3% to US$108.17 million, up from US$105.06 million, while quoted equity investments declined by 1.11%, falling to US$460.37 million from US$465.56 million.\n\nPrescribed asset investments, which fund government securities, also dipped by 2%, decreasing to US$274 million (ZWG7.38 billion) from US$280 million, reflecting a more cautious investment stance amid ongoing economic uncertainty.\n\n",
