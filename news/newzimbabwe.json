            "content": "By Anne Okumu & Brian Khisa l BBC News\n\nLESEGO Chombos enthusiasm for life is as infectious as her achievements are impressive: she has won the Miss Botswana 2022 and Miss World Africa 2024 crowns, is a working lawyer, has set up her own charitable foundation  and made history in November, becoming Botswanas youngest cabinet minister.\n\nShe was just 26 years old at the time  and had clearly impressed Botswanas incoming President Duma Boko, whose Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) had just won a landslide, ousting the party that had governed for 58 years.It was a seismic shift in the politics of the diamond-rich southern African nation  and Boko, a 55-year-old Harvard-trained lawyer, hit the ground running.His main focus, he said, was fixing an economy too reliant on diamonds, telling the BBC ahead of his inauguration that he wanted young people to be the solution  to become entrepreneurs, employ themselves and employ others.Key to this was finding a suitable ambassador  and Chombo was clearly it: a young woman already committed to various causes.He made her minister of youth and gender.Ive never been more proud to be young, she told the BBC at the ministrys headquarters in the capital, Gaborone.Im a young person living in Botswana, passionate about youth development, gender equality, but also so passionate about the development of children.The beauty queen did not campaign to be an MP  she is what is called a specially elected member of parliament  and is now one of just six female MPs in the 69-member National Assembly.Chombo said becoming an MP and then minister came as a complete surprise to her.I got appointed by a president who had never met me, she said.Miss World and the journey that I thought I was supposed to pursue as my final destination was only the platform through which I would be seen for this very role.It was her crowning as Miss Botswana in 2022 that raised her profile and enabled her to campaign for social change, while trying to inspire other young women.It also gave her the opportunity to set up the Lesego Chombo Foundation, which focuses on supporting disadvantaged youngsters and their parents in rural areas  and which she is still involved with, its projects funded by corporate companies and others.We strive to have a world where we feel seen and heard and represented. Im very thrilled that I happen to be the very essence of that representation, she said.Lesego Chombo, now 27, is an associate at a law firm in Gaborone.As she prepared for last years Miss World pageant, she said: I really put myself in the zone of service. I really channelled it for this big crown.Now in political office, she is aware of the expectations placed on her in a country where approximately 60% of the population is below 35 years.It also has a high level of unemployment  28%, which is even higher for young people and women who have limited economic opportunities and battle systemic corruption.Chombo said this was something she was determined to change: Currently in Botswana, the rates of unemployment are so high.But its not just the rate of unemployment, its also just the sphere of youth development.Its lacking, and so my desire is to create an ecosystem, an environment, a society, an economy in which youth can thrive.Chombo said her plan was to develop a comprehensive system that nurtured youth-led initiatives, strengthened entrepreneurship and ensured young people had a seat at the table when decisions were being made.With Botswanas anti-corruption policy undergoing a rigorous review, she said this would ensure that quotas for young entrepreneurs  when state departments and agencies put out tenders for goods and services  were actually reached.The government has begun a 10-month forensic audit of government spending that will include 30 state-owned enterprises.Indeed President Boko is intent on cracking down on corruption, seeing this as a way to bolter investor confidence and diversify the economy  something his deputy has been seeking to do on recent trips to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Switzerland.And a key deal has now been secured with UAE-based CCI Global, a provider of business process outsourcing, to open a hub in Botswana.While youth development is a central pillar of her work, gender equity also remains close to her heart.Her short time in office has coincided with a growing outcry over gender-based violence.According to a United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) report, over 67% of women in Botswana have experienced abuse, more than double the global average.It hurts to know that it could be me next, she admitted.A month into her appointment, she was criticised for voting against an opposition motion in parliament to create peace desks at police stations and magistrate courts to quickly deal with victims.At the time she said such provisions already existed within the law and what was needed was more public awareness.This was followed in January by a police report noting that at least 100 women had been raped and another 10 murdered during the festive season  this caused public outrage with many lashing out at her on social media over the issue.The minister reiterated  on several occasions, including before parliament in March  that Botswana had many laws and strategies in place and what was important was to ensure these they were actually applied.But she told the BBC the government would be pushing for the implementation of a Gender-Based Violence Act, aimed at closing legal loopholes that have long hindered justice for survivors.She said she was also advocating a more holistic approach, involving the ministries of health, education and local government.We want curriculums that promote gender equity from a young age, Chombo said.We want to teach children what gender-based violence is and how to prevent it.It will boil down to inclusion of teaching gender equity at home, how parents behave around their children, how they model good behaviour.She has also been vocal about the need to address issues affecting men, particularly around mental health and positive masculinity, encouraging chiefs to ensure that our patriarchal culture is not actively perpetuating gender violence.I hear a lot of people say: Why do you speak of women more than men?Its because as it stands in society, women are mostly prejudiced [against].But when we speak of gender equality, were saying that it should be applied equally for everyone. But what we strive for is gender equity.Chombo, who studied law at the University of Botswana, said she was thankful to her mother and other strong women for inspiring her  saying that women had to work 10 times harder to succeed.[My mother] has managed to create an environment for me to thrive. And growing up, I got to realise that its not an easy thing.As women, we face so many pressures: A woman cannot do this. A woman cant do that. A woman cant be young and in leadership. Im currently facing that.She also credited Julia Morley, the CEO of Miss World, for helping her: She has managed to create a legacy of what we call beauty with a purpose for so many young girls across the world.She has just inspired us so deeply to take up social responsibility.Chombo is serious about this. The beauty queen-cum-lawyer-cum-minister knows she has made history  but is also aware that her real work has only just begun.Impact. Tangible impact. Thats what success would look like to me, she said.I want to look back and see that it is there and it is sustainable. That when I leave, someone else is able to carry it through.Additional reporting from Innocent Selatlhwa in Gaborone.\n\nShe was just 26 years old at the time  and had clearly impressed Botswanas incoming President Duma Boko, whose Umbrella for Democratic Change (UDC) had just won a landslide, ousting the party that had governed for 58 years.\n\nIt was a seismic shift in the politics of the diamond-rich southern African nation  and Boko, a 55-year-old Harvard-trained lawyer, hit the ground running.His main focus, he said, was fixing an economy too reliant on diamonds, telling the BBC ahead of his inauguration that he wanted young people to be the solution  to become entrepreneurs, employ themselves and employ others.Key to this was finding a suitable ambassador  and Chombo was clearly it: a young woman already committed to various causes.He made her minister of youth and gender.Ive never been more proud to be young, she told the BBC at the ministrys headquarters in the capital, Gaborone.Im a young person living in Botswana, passionate about youth development, gender equality, but also so passionate about the development of children.The beauty queen did not campaign to be an MP  she is what is called a specially elected member of parliament  and is now one of just six female MPs in the 69-member National Assembly.Chombo said becoming an MP and then minister came as a complete surprise to her.I got appointed by a president who had never met me, she said.Miss World and the journey that I thought I was supposed to pursue as my final destination was only the platform through which I would be seen for this very role.It was her crowning as Miss Botswana in 2022 that raised her profile and enabled her to campaign for social change, while trying to inspire other young women.It also gave her the opportunity to set up the Lesego Chombo Foundation, which focuses on supporting disadvantaged youngsters and their parents in rural areas  and which she is still involved with, its projects funded by corporate companies and others.We strive to have a world where we feel seen and heard and represented.

I really channelled it for this big crown.Now in political office, she is aware of the expectations placed on her in a country where approximately 60% of the population is below 35 years.It also has a high level of unemployment  28%, which is even higher for young people and women who have limited economic opportunities and battle systemic corruption.Chombo said this was something she was determined to change: Currently in Botswana, the rates of unemployment are so high.But its not just the rate of unemployment, its also just the sphere of youth development.Its lacking, and so my desire is to create an ecosystem, an environment, a society, an economy in which youth can thrive.Chombo said her plan was to develop a comprehensive system that nurtured youth-led initiatives, strengthened entrepreneurship and ensured young people had a seat at the table when decisions were being made.With Botswanas anti-corruption policy undergoing a rigorous review, she said this would ensure that quotas for young entrepreneurs  when state departments and agencies put out tenders for goods and services  were actually reached.The government has begun a 10-month forensic audit of government spending that will include 30 state-owned enterprises.Indeed President Boko is intent on cracking down on corruption, seeing this as a way to bolter investor confidence and diversify the economy  something his deputy has been seeking to do on recent trips to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Switzerland.And a key deal has now been secured with UAE-based CCI Global, a provider of business process outsourcing, to open a hub in Botswana.While youth development is a central pillar of her work, gender equity also remains close to her heart.Her short time in office has coincided with a growing outcry over gender-based violence.According to a United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) report, over 67% of women in Botswana have experienced abuse, more than double the global average.It hurts to know that it could be me next, she admitted.A month into her appointment, she was criticised for voting against an opposition motion in parliament to create peace desks at police stations and magistrate courts to quickly deal with victims.At the time she said such provisions already existed within the law and what was needed was more public awareness.This was followed in January by a police report noting that at least 100 women had been raped and another 10 murdered during the festive season  this caused public outrage with many lashing out at her on social media over the issue.The minister reiterated  on several occasions, including before parliament in March  that Botswana had many laws and strategies in place and what was important was to ensure these they were actually applied.But she told the BBC the government would be pushing for the implementation of a Gender-Based Violence Act, aimed at closing legal loopholes that have long hindered justice for survivors.She said she was also advocating a more holistic approach, involving the ministries of health, education and local government.We want curriculums that promote gender equity from a young age, Chombo said.We want to teach children what gender-based violence is and how to prevent it.It will boil down to inclusion of teaching gender equity at home, how parents behave around their children, how they model good behaviour.She has also been vocal about the need to address issues affecting men, particularly around mental health and positive masculinity, encouraging chiefs to ensure that our patriarchal culture is not actively perpetuating gender violence.I hear a lot of people say: Why do you speak of women more than men?Its because as it stands in society, women are mostly prejudiced [against].But when we speak of gender equality, were saying that it should be applied equally for everyone. But what we strive for is gender equity.Chombo, who studied law at the University of Botswana, said she was thankful to her mother and other strong women for inspiring her  saying that women had to work 10 times harder to succeed.[My mother] has managed to create an environment for me to thrive. And growing up, I got to realise that its not an easy thing.As women, we face so many pressures: A woman cannot do this. A woman cant do that. A woman cant be young and in leadership. Im currently facing that.She also credited Julia Morley, the CEO of Miss World, for helping her: She has managed to create a legacy of what we call beauty with a purpose for so many young girls across the world.She has just inspired us so deeply to take up social responsibility.Chombo is serious about this. The beauty queen-cum-lawyer-cum-minister knows she has made history  but is also aware that her real work has only just begun.Impact. Tangible impact. Thats what success would look like to me, she said.I want to look back and see that it is there and it is sustainable.

That when I leave, someone else is able to carry it through.Additional reporting from Innocent Selatlhwa in Gaborone.\n\nI got appointed by a president who had never met me, she said.\n\nMiss World and the journey that I thought I was supposed to pursue as my final destination was only the platform through which I would be seen for this very role.It was her crowning as Miss Botswana in 2022 that raised her profile and enabled her to campaign for social change, while trying to inspire other young women.It also gave her the opportunity to set up the Lesego Chombo Foundation, which focuses on supporting disadvantaged youngsters and their parents in rural areas  and which she is still involved with, its projects funded by corporate companies and others.We strive to have a world where we feel seen and heard and represented. Im very thrilled that I happen to be the very essence of that representation, she said.Lesego Chombo, now 27, is an associate at a law firm in Gaborone.As she prepared for last years Miss World pageant, she said: I really put myself in the zone of service. I really channelled it for this big crown.Now in political office, she is aware of the expectations placed on her in a country where approximately 60% of the population is below 35 years.It also has a high level of unemployment  28%, which is even higher for young people and women who have limited economic opportunities and battle systemic corruption.Chombo said this was something she was determined to change: Currently in Botswana, the rates of unemployment are so high.But its not just the rate of unemployment, its also just the sphere of youth development.Its lacking, and so my desire is to create an ecosystem, an environment, a society, an economy in which youth can thrive.Chombo said her plan was to develop a comprehensive system that nurtured youth-led initiatives, strengthened entrepreneurship and ensured young people had a seat at the table when decisions were being made.With Botswanas anti-corruption policy undergoing a rigorous review, she said this would ensure that quotas for young entrepreneurs  when state departments and agencies put out tenders for goods and services  were actually reached.The government has begun a 10-month forensic audit of government spending that will include 30 state-owned enterprises.Indeed President Boko is intent on cracking down on corruption, seeing this as a way to bolter investor confidence and diversify the economy  something his deputy has been seeking to do on recent trips to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Switzerland.And a key deal has now been secured with UAE-based CCI Global, a provider of business process outsourcing, to open a hub in Botswana.While youth development is a central pillar of her work, gender equity also remains close to her heart.Her short time in office has coincided with a growing outcry over gender-based violence.According to a United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) report, over 67% of women in Botswana have experienced abuse, more than double the global average.It hurts to know that it could be me next, she admitted.A month into her appointment, she was criticised for voting against an opposition motion in parliament to create peace desks at police stations and magistrate courts to quickly deal with victims.At the time she said such provisions already existed within the law and what was needed was more public awareness.This was followed in January by a police report noting that at least 100 women had been raped and another 10 murdered during the festive season  this caused public outrage with many lashing out at her on social media over the issue.The minister reiterated  on several occasions, including before parliament in March  that Botswana had many laws and strategies in place and what was important was to ensure these they were actually applied.But she told the BBC the government would be pushing for the implementation of a Gender-Based Violence Act, aimed at closing legal loopholes that have long hindered justice for survivors.She said she was also advocating a more holistic approach, involving the ministries of health, education and local government.We want curriculums that promote gender equity from a young age, Chombo said.We want to teach children what gender-based violence is and how to prevent it.It will boil down to inclusion of teaching gender equity at home, how parents behave around their children, how they model good behaviour.She has also been vocal about the need to address issues affecting men, particularly around mental health and positive masculinity, encouraging chiefs to ensure that our patriarchal culture is not actively perpetuating gender violence.I hear a lot of people say: Why do you speak of women more than men?Its because as it stands in society, women are mostly prejudiced [against].But when we speak of gender equality, were saying that it should be applied equally for everyone. But what we strive for is gender equity.Chombo, who studied law at the University of Botswana, said she was thankful to her mother and other strong women for inspiring her  saying that women had to work 10 times harder to succeed.[My mother] has managed to create an environment for me to thrive. And growing up, I got to realise that its not an easy thing.As women, we face so many pressures: A woman cannot do this. A woman cant do that. A woman cant be young and in leadership. Im currently facing that.She also credited Julia Morley, the CEO of Miss World, for helping her: She has managed to create a legacy of what we call beauty with a purpose for so many young girls across the world.She has just inspired us so deeply to take up social responsibility.Chombo is serious about this.

But what we strive for is gender equity.Chombo, who studied law at the University of Botswana, said she was thankful to her mother and other strong women for inspiring her  saying that women had to work 10 times harder to succeed.[My mother] has managed to create an environment for me to thrive.

In 2022 the country recorded 4,912 serious accidents and 76 fatalities, in 2023 we had 4,334 serious accidents with 60 fatalities, in 2024 we had 4,242 accidents, with 70 fatalities, said Moyo.The year 2025 has started on a bad note, the minister said.This year alone in the first two months we have already recorded 720 injuries and 12 deaths. Whilst we recognise the efforts made in reducing the occupational accidents let us remember that even a single injury or death is one too many, he added.\n\nHis concern follows revelations that since year 2022, Zimbabwe has witnessed in excess of 4,000 accidents yearly at workplaces.\n\nIn a speech read on his behalf by Labour and Social Welfare Deputy Minister Mercy Maruva-Dinha, during World Day for Safety and Health at Work commemorations held in Chinhoyi Friday, Moyo said the high number of deaths and injuries was worrisome.Labour and Social Welfare Minister, Edgar MoyoThe statistics on occupational accidents, injuries, and fatalities are deeply concerning.

These developments present us with both significant opportunities and considerable challenges in occupational safety and health.We need to be cognisant of the fact that automation, artificial intelligence, digital technologies, and robotics are reshaping the way we work, where we work and the very nature of the tasks we perform.While these innovations offer immense potential for increased productivity and efficiency, they also introduce new and complex risks to the safety and health of our workforce. It is imperative to understand that technology is no longer a mere enabler but a critical driver of safer workplaces.AI-powered predictive analytics now allow us to foresee and prevent workplace hazards before they cause harm. Wearable safety devices and smart sensors continuously monitor workers environments, detecting exposure to hazardous substances or unsafe conditions in real time.Digital training platforms have made OSH (occupational health and safety) training and awareness more accessible, ensuring that workers at all levels are equipped with the necessary knowledge and skills to stay safe, said the Labour minister.Moyo noted that the world is witnessing the integration of robotics and automation in high-risk industries, reducing direct human exposure to dangerous tasks. He said the shift has great potential to save lives and improve overall productivity.He, however, highlighted that with these technological advancements come new challenges, such as job displacement, the need to upskill workers, psychological impact of automation, and ethical deployment of AI-driven safety measures.It is, therefore, critical to capacity build our workforce towards artificial intelligence and make them relevant and proactive to the future of work dynamics.As Government of Zimbabwe, we acknowledge the urgent need to review our labour policies and occupational safety and health frameworks to keep up with these rapid technological changes.We remain committed to strengthening our OSH statutes, ensuring they address both the risks and opportunities brought about by digitalisation. Collaboration with relevant stakeholders, including international partners like the ILO, is essential to create a balanced approach where technology enhances safety without undermining workers rights and job security, he said.Moyo said Zimbabwe is dedicated to protecting safety and health of all workers in the country, as demonstrated by our ratification of several key occupational safety and health conventions.He also urged employers to ensure strict observance of safety and health guidelines.We can not continue to lose valuable workers who are a key factor of production due to death and injury through preventable accidents.These preventable accidents not only impact workers lives but also have far-reaching consequences for their families, communities, and the economy at large, he said.The minister said inorder to achieve Zimbabwes Vision 2030, which aims to transform our country into an upper-middle-income economy by the year 2030, there is need for a safer, and healthier workforce.For us to achieve this vision, we must create a labour market that is resilient, productive, and sustainable; and that means putting OSH issues at the forefront of our national development agenda.I would want to urge NSSA (National Social Security Authority) to start investing in digital infrastructure that helps improve OSH monitoring and compliance enforcement, Moyo said.\n\nWorld Day for Safety and Health is celebrated the world over on April 28 every year and serves as a reminder of the collective responsibility to ensure that every worker, regardless of their occupation, has the right to a safe and healthy working environment.\n\nThis years event was held under the theme, Occupational Safety and Health: Technology and the Future of Work, which Moyo says aligns seamlessly with the International Labour Organisations (ILO) theme, Revolutionising Health and Safety: The Role of Artifical Intelligence (AI) and Digitalisation at Work.This theme is especially timely and relevant, as Zimbabwe and the world are witnessing rapid technological advancements.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nIN a tragic incident that has rocked Bindura, Mashonaland Central province, a 49-year-old house maid was allegedly murdered by her partner, who also reportedly strangled her visiting relative.\n\nThe visitor Fiona Musani (16), had come to spend time with her now deceased aunt Margret Takawira last Monday. She did not know that tragedy would unfold later that evening.\n\nThe alleged killed was identified only as Rambo, an artisanal miner commonly known as mukorokoza.In an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Fiona narrated how her aunts lover returned home, initially being cosy and seemingly caring only to turn violent later.I had came to fix my phone and then decided to go and collect my clothes at her homestead. Whilst I was there, my aunt asked me to slaughter a live chicken and then prepare it for supper whilst she was removing weeds around her house.Around past 8 in the evening, we were done eating and now watching a movie, thats when her lover came and knocked on the door and I opened for him. He asked my aunt what she wanted him to buy for us, and the decision was some chips and drinks.He then begged to go with her to the shops but my aunt refused, complaining of being tired and that she wanted to sleep. He then went with me, but I later returned alone and ate the chips with my aunt, said Fiona.Upon Rambos return home, a quarrel with Fiona over the TV remote control ensued resulting in him strangling her.At this juncture, the aunt reportedly complained about his violent behaviour against the teenager, which did not go down well with Rambo.He immediately slapped her, chocked her also and threw her against the wall. After a while she then started to complain that she was feeling hot. I later retired to bed and left them alone, narrated Fiona.The teenager recounted that around 11pm, Rambo woke her up and claimed that her aunt had collapsed outside, only to find her lying flat on the ground unable to speak while gasping for air.She vomitted two times and told me to go and fetch her neighbour. That was the last time I talked to her. When I returned, l found her struggling to breathe, narrated Fiona.Rambo missing in actionPeople started gathering at the scene and a neighbour asked me where Rambo was while his partner was in pain. I told him he was inside the house playing music.When the neighbour wanted to enter my aunts house, Rambo warned that he would assault anyone who dared enter. Neighbours then teamed up and started manhandling him for lack of concern over his partner who lay in a critical state and fighting for her life. They then tied both his legs and hands.Margret was later rushed to a local clinic, where she was declared dead upon arrival. Medical staff ascertained that victim had suffered severe internal injuries.On Tuesday morning, Rambo was handed over to the police pending further investigations.The now deceaseds landlord confided to NewZimbabwe.com that Margaret had endured a four-year childless relationship with her violent partner.If l am not mistaken she lived here for four years.

Fear and uncertainty now shrouds Musanhi and her family.Justice must prevail but the truth is we now live in fear and dont know what he will plan to do on us, said Musanhi.\n\nThe alleged killed was identified only as Rambo, an artisanal miner commonly known as mukorokoza.\n\nIn an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Fiona narrated how her aunts lover returned home, initially being cosy and seemingly caring only to turn violent later.\n\nI had came to fix my phone and then decided to go and collect my clothes at her homestead. Whilst I was there, my aunt asked me to slaughter a live chicken and then prepare it for supper whilst she was removing weeds around her house.\n\nAround past 8 in the evening, we were done eating and now watching a movie, thats when her lover came and knocked on the door and I opened for him. He asked my aunt what she wanted him to buy for us, and the decision was some chips and drinks.\n\nHe then begged to go with her to the shops but my aunt refused, complaining of being tired and that she wanted to sleep. He then went with me, but I later returned alone and ate the chips with my aunt, said Fiona.\n\nUpon Rambos return home, a quarrel with Fiona over the TV remote control ensued resulting in him strangling her.\n\nAt this juncture, the aunt reportedly complained about his violent behaviour against the teenager, which did not go down well with Rambo.\n\nHe immediately slapped her, chocked her also and threw her against the wall. After a while she then started to complain that she was feeling hot. I later retired to bed and left them alone, narrated Fiona.\n\nThe teenager recounted that around 11pm, Rambo woke her up and claimed that her aunt had collapsed outside, only to find her lying flat on the ground unable to speak while gasping for air.\n\nShe vomitted two times and told me to go and fetch her neighbour. That was the last time I talked to her. When I returned, l found her struggling to breathe, narrated Fiona.\n\nRambo missing in actionPeople started gathering at the scene and a neighbour asked me where Rambo was while his partner was in pain. I told him he was inside the house playing music.When the neighbour wanted to enter my aunts house, Rambo warned that he would assault anyone who dared enter. Neighbours then teamed up and started manhandling him for lack of concern over his partner who lay in a critical state and fighting for her life. They then tied both his legs and hands.Margret was later rushed to a local clinic, where she was declared dead upon arrival.
