            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nWAR Veterans farming at Springs Farm have pushed back against government-assisted attempts by top businessman Billy Rautenbach to grab their land.\n\nLocal Government Minister Daniel Garwe, who in the past has been fingered in attempts to repossess land reserved for Parliamentarians, stands accused in the scandal that could likely displace hundreds.\n\nAccording to documents gleaned by NewZimbabwe.com, his Ministry is seeking to reopen a case that could grant Rautenbach ownership of land the High Court already decided was not his.\n\nThe war vets, under the Springs Farmers Association, have filed their intent to oppose the ministrys application, arguing that the government cannot relitigate a matter that was final and conclusive and that any further interference puts Zimbabwes land-reform credibility at stake.\n\nThe dispute centres on a March 2025 offer letter issued by Local Government Minister Daniel Garwe, allocating 671 hectares at Springs Farm and 412 hectares at Stuhm to Marimba Residential Properties (Pvt) Ltd as final compensation for land in Aspindale Park, Lochinvar, and Salisbury Park that the company claims to have lost years ago.\n\nHowever, the courts have already ruled on the matter.\n\nIn 2019, the High Court found that businessman Rautenbach and his associated companies had no valid title to the Aspindale property, affirming that the land had been lawfully acquired by the State and allocated to housing co-operatives under the National Housing Delivery Programme.\n\nThat ruling, described by the judge as final and definitive, was never overturned.\n\nDocuments show that while Marimba claims to have lost about 180 hectares in Aspindale, the new offer compensates it with over 1,100 hectares of prime farmland, six times the size and far higher in market and agricultural value.\n\nThe paper trail surrounding Marimba Residential Properties raises more questions than answers.\n\nThe Registrar of Companies confirmed in 2018 that Marimba Residential Properties and Marimba Industrial Properties are not registered companies in our database.\n\nAt the same time, the Registrar of Deeds admitted that the title deed purportedly linking Marimba to the Aspindale property is missing from the record.\n\nDespite those gaps, the company continues to feature in official correspondence and now, in the new compensation offer.\n\nIn their newly filed opposition, the farmers accuse the government of attempting to rescind a ruling made on the merits, which the law does not allow.\n\nThey describe the governments filing as a composite application that is procedurally and substantively defective, arguing that it merges three distinct processes: review, rescission, and interdict into a single motion, something the farmers lawyers say is jurisprudentially untenable.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nPermanent Secretary in the Ministry of Information and Publicity, Nick Mangwana, says government restricted public access to the Mbuya Nehanda statue in Harares Central Business District following several attempts of vandalism.\n\nThe statue, unveiled by President Emmerson Mnangagwa in 2021, cost the State a substantial amount of money.\n\nSince its unveiling, the monument which stands at the corner of Julius Nyerere Way and Samora Machel Avenue has been inaccessible to the public, with police officers stationed to guard it.\n\nThe monument was initially accessible to the public. Unfortunately, after a rise in visitor numbers and repeated vandalism attempts, including people trying to push it over or deface it, access had to be restricted, said Mangwana in a post on X.\n\nHe added that government is now working on measures to reopen access to the statue.\n\nTo enable safe public viewing of the Mbuya Nehanda statue, while protecting the iconic monument, the government is creating a new access framework. The President has instructed that this be implemented as soon as possible. We take this opportunity to apologize to the public for the delayed access, he said.\n\nMangwanas response follows criticism after international travel vlogger Davud Akhundzada was denied access to the statue during a recent visit.\n\nAuthorities came under fire for missing an opportunity to market Zimbabwes capital city.\n\nIn a statement, the Ministry of Tourism and Hospitality Industry distanced itself from the incident, saying responsibility for the monument lies with the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage.\n\nWe wish to clarify that the Mbuya Nehanda Statue is a National Heritage Monument managed by the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage. It stands as a proud symbol of Zimbabwes liberation history and identity.\n\nThe site is subject to specific preservation and security protocols and as such, public access to certain areas, including elevated or restricted zones, may be limited for safety, preservation and security reasons.\n\nHowever, as the Ministry of Tourism and Hospitality Industry, we are taking proactive steps to enhance tourist management at such sites. Through a Whole-of-Government Approach Strategy, in coordination with our counterparts at the Ministry of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage, we are in the process of deploying tourism officers at key heritage and cultural monuments. These officers will facilitate seamless, well-informed and welcoming access for tourists, ensuring a positive experience while safeguarding our national heritage, read the statement.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nResidents of Glenview, one of Harares cholera hotspots, have petitioned Mayor Jacob Mafume to stop the planned demolition of a public borehole that serves more than 2,800 people.\n\nThe move follows a 48-hour removal notice issued by the City of Harare, ordering the clearing of the borehole site to pave way for four residential infill stands. The council cited illegal occupation under municipal by-laws.\n\nThe borehole, drilled in 2019 under the Presidential Borehole Scheme, remains the communitys main source of clean water in an area already suffering from severe shortages. No alternative water source has been proposed to replace it.\n\nIn a petition signed by 280 residents and submitted to the mayor on Wednesday, the community urged council to form a special committee to investigate the land allocations and assess how many boreholes would be affected by the planned housing development.\n\nThe Petitioner beseeches the Harare City Council to establish a Special Committee pursuant to Section 100 of the Urban Councils Act (Chapter 29:15), conduct an investigation into the allocation of infill residential stands in Glen View, determine the number of boreholes that will be affected, and provide recommendations to mitigate the water supply issues that may arise from the removal of the boreholes, the petition reads in part.\n\nResidents warned that demolishing the borehole without providing an alternative water source would violate their constitutional right to water and risk triggering another public health crisis in the cholera-prone suburb.\n\nThey also questioned how stands approved in 2024 could overlap with a borehole installed in 2018 and upgraded in 2025, describing the sequence as evidence of poor planning and possible corruption.\n\nAdding to their frustration, residents said individuals allocated the contested stands have already begun bringing building materials to the site, despite the ongoing dispute.\n\nThe petitioners further demanded that the City of Harare convene a public meeting to release documents showing whether the land was properly allocated before the borehole was drilled.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nGovernment has officially acquired the historic Monomotapa Hotel to serve as a dedicated lodging facility for Members of Parliament, in a move aimed at curbing expenditure.\n\nFinance Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube made the announcement, describing the acquisition as a strategic step towards increasing efficiency and reducing the financial burden associated with parliamentary operations.\n\nThe move, he explained, will provide MPs with a convenient and cost-effective alternative to expensive private accommodation during parliamentary sessions and national events.\n\nThe governments acquisition of the Monomotapa Hotel underscores our ongoing commitment to improving the welfare of our Parliamentarians while also addressing the broader issue of fiscal responsibility. This initiative is not just about cutting costs, but about ensuring that public funds are used wisely, allowing for more resources to be directed toward national priorities, said Ncube.\n\nAlthough no current figures were provided, a 2013 report highlighted the high cost of hosting MPs in Harare, revealing that sitting allowances, accommodation, and travel expenses for Parliamentarians could easily exceed US$200,000 per week when both Houses were in session. With fuel allowances, travel stipends, and hotel bills, the financial burden had become unsustainable.\n\nThe decision to repurpose Monomotapa Hotel for government use is expected to deliver significant savings, which could be redirected to other national development priorities, thereby improving both efficiency and public service delivery.\n\nThe hotels previous owner, African Sun Limited, sold the property as part of a broader strategy to consolidate its portfolio, a move that reshapes the local hospitality sector. With its prime location and storied past, the hotels new role as a government facility is likely to redefine Harares hospitality landscape and spark debate over the balance between tourism, state infrastructure, and public service.\n\n",

As this was happening, Amour, who was a passenger in the truck, led officers to the loading box where there were lunch boxes wrapped in foil and loaded among bags of beans. He opened one of the boxes and started eating spaghetti in a bid to divert their attention.\n\nSome of the officers conducted a further search, leading to the discovery of more boxes containing methamphetamine hidden in a specially designed compartment on the roof of the truck.\n\nSensing danger, the driver and another passenger fled the scene, but the offender was arrested before he could escape. The truck was subsequently seized and forfeited to the State.\n\nIn a statement following sentencing, the National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) said drug misuse and trafficking in harmful substances were destroying lives and communities across the country hence the need for stiffer sentences against peddlers.\n\nCases like this highlight the serious consequences of choosing the drug trade over honest living. Let this be a warning to all, the law is watching and the courts are taking a firm stance, the NPAZ noted.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nMany Ugandans are expressing their pride in the newly elected mayor of New York, Zohran Mamdani, who was born in Uganda and retains dual nationality.\n\nSome have described him as one of their own, saying he inspires them.\n\nA journalist who mentored him during his teenage internship at one of Ugandas leading newspapers told the BBC that there was a lot of excitement in Uganda about Mamdanis rise especially because of his young age. Uganda has the second-lowest median age worldwide of just 16.2, according to the CIA World Factbook.\n\nZohran, 34, is the son of Prof Mahmood Mamdani, a prominent Ugandan academic, while his mother, Mira Nair, is an acclaimed filmmaker.\n\nJournalist Angelo Izama told the BBCs Newsday programme that the younger Mamdani was initially shy while they worked together, but was absolutely determined to get things done.\n\nHe says Zohran is very fond of Kampala, Ugandas capital, which he often mentions.\n\nMahmood Mamdani was raised in Uganda and worked for more than a decade at Makerere University, the countrys main and oldest university. He met his wife in Kampala while she was researching Mississippi Masala, a film about the expulsion of Asians from Uganda under Idi Amin.\n\nProf Mamdani is known for his anti-colonialist scholarship, which examines the legacy of colonialism in Africa and its impact on governance, identity and justice.\n\nMakerere University professor Okello Ogwang says he feels great about Zohrans success, describing him as the son of a colleague. This is somebody from home.\n\nWe have one of us there, he told the BBC.\n\nIt gives me hope that the children we are raising are the hope of this world. As a continent we are missing out on the greatest resource we have  the youth.\n\nWhile many Ugandans had not heard of Zohran until his election, a student at the university said people were very happy, saying it proved that anyone could rise above their background.\n\nIt gives morale, especially to us as youths, said Abno Collins Kuloba. Wherever you have grown up, be it poor or rich, you can become something big, like what [Mamdani] has done.\n\nAnother student, Chemtai Zamzam, said she was happy, for herself and Ugandans. She said Mamdani was an inspiration to her as a young person, as it shows we can become anything we want as long as we put faith and determination.\n\nThe new mayor is also being celebrated elsewhere in the continent.\n\nAbdul Mohamed, an Ethiopian who is a former senior UN and African Union official, describes Mahmood Mamdani as a distinguished scholar of African politics, a man who interrogated power and justice.\n\nHe says having known Zohran since infancy, he sees him as having inherited his fathers commitment to pan-Africanism, his parents courage to think freely, and their belief that one can belong everywhere.\n\nHe says Zohrans rise is symbolic and practical especially to young Africans, asking them to draw from him lessons in politics.\n\nI think through him, [the] power and beauty of multi-ethnic, multi-religious identity found its voice. And Africa is by and large a multi-ethnic and a multi-religious society, he says.\n\nHe adds that as Zohran has demonstrated, young people need to organise and build political action and avoid despair and avoid pure anger.\n\nUganda is holding elections next year, with 81-year-old President Yoweri Museveni seeking another term after almost 40 years in power.\n\nThe Mamdani family also spent at around three years in Cape Town, South Africa, after Mahmood was appointed the Chair of African Studies at the University of Cape Town in the 1990s.\n\nSome South Africans have also been taking pride in his historic election.\n\nHailing his victory as as a remarkable achievement, the imam of Cape Towns Claremont Road Mosque, Rashied Omar, said that Zohrans formative years were shaped, in small part, in our congregation.\n\nHe said that Zohran began his Islamic education at the mosque, and started his schooling at St Georges Grammar.\n\nIt is inspiring to see how Zohrans early South African experiences, though modest, made a lasting impression on his political consciousness and helped shape his creative, community-based approach to politics, Dr Omar said.\n\nAs South African social justice activists, we can now learn from Zohrans example, how to practise progressive politics that resonates with new generations and builds bridges across race, class, and faith, he added.\n\nThe Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), the fourth-biggest party in South Africa which champions left-wing economic policies, also hailed Zohrans victory as historic.\n\nHis election represents not only a transformative moment for the people of New York but also a powerful signal to the world that progressive justice-driven leadership is rising even in the heart of the global capitalist order, the party said in a statement.\n\nIn Nigeria, a Christian pastor who is a supporter of President Bola Tinubu also welcomed Zohrans victory.\n\nPastor Okezie J Atai said on X that Nigeria cannot be threatenedby US President Donald Trump, whose threats could not subdue the 34-year-old Zohran.\n\nLast week,Trump threatened to take military action to tackle Islamist insurgents in Nigeria, accusing the government of failing to protect Christians.\n\nGovernment officials responded by saying that jihadists were not targeting members of a particular religion and that they had killed people from all faiths, or none.\n\n",
