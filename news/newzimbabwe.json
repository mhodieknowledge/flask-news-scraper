The appellant did not carry the burden of proof.\n\nCiting theKazingiingizi v Dzinorumaprecedent, the court warned that decisions without clear reasoning are susceptible to being perceived as arbitrary or capricious.\n\nThe court allowed the appeal with costs and ordered that Makani be reinstated without loss of salary or benefits from the date of dismissal. If reinstatement is impossible, the CSC must pay damages to be agreed upon within 30 days.\n\n",

The event will mark the launch of an annual initiative designed to foster long-term partnerships that promote sustainable economic growth and development.\n\nZimUKBCs primary mission is to connect people in business, facilitate peer networking, support enterprise growth, and empower small and medium-sized businesses to reach their full potential. With members drawn largely from Zimbabwe and Southern Africa, the organisation supports businesses across diverse sectors including health and social care, retail, agro-business, manufacturing, finance, services, and technology.\n\nIt also serves as a powerful voice in policy discussions, ensuring that the interests of its members are heard at the highest levels. The Trade and Investment Indaba will serve as a platform to promote Zimbabwes untapped potential, encourage joint ventures between UK investors and Zimbabwean SMEs, and showcase opportunities across industries such as agriculture, mining, manufacturing, tourism, infrastructure, finance, technology, and logistics.\n\nIn convening this event, ZimUKBC will work closely with key national agencies and institutions, including the Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency (ZIDA), ZimTrade, the Zimbabwe National Chamber of Commerce (ZNCC), and the Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI), all of which share the vision of expanding exports, attracting foreign investment, and fostering bilateral trade.\n\nThe Indaba will feature high-level business-to-business networking sessions, thought-provoking presentations, and a celebratory gala dinner to mark the launch of this new tradition. Distinguished guests will include a senior trade and investment official from the British Embassy in Zimbabwe, adding to the significance of the occasion.\n\nKennedy Mwedziwendira, Chairman and Founder of ZimUKBC, expressed his excitement about the event, describing it as a pivotal moment for diaspora-driven investment and trade.\n\nThis Indaba will be a pivotal platform to build meaningful partnerships between UK investors and Zimbabwean businesses, particularly within the diaspora community. We are excited to establish it as an annual event that accelerates investment, trade, and sustainable economic growth, he said. The ZimUK Business Chamber sees this first gathering as the foundation for stronger economic bridges between Zimbabwe and the United Kingdom, with the potential to contribute significantly to the countrys development while opening new opportunities for UK investors in one of Africas most promising markets.\n\n",

His comments were made as he discussed actions taken by the Patriotic Alliance against the podcast hosts.\n\nFollowing the backlash over the live video, McKenzies posts dating back from 2011 and 2013 were uncovered. These tweets contained apartheid-era racial slurs directed at black South Africans, and he criticised the term Black Diamond while using racially charged language widely considered reprehensible in South Africa.\n\nThe ATMfiled formal complaints with the Presidency, Parliament, and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Ethics and Members Interests. ATM Parliamentary leader Vuyo Zungula described the tweets as racially derogatory slurs that undermine democratic principles.\n\nZungula added that the language employs language steeped in historical racism, the same kind of degrading rhetoric used to strip black people of their humanity during apartheid and colonial eras.\n\nThe party demanded an urgent investigation and called for McKenzies removal, arguing that an unrepentant Minister cannot credibly lead a department tasked with building cultural bridges and fostering unity.\n\nActionSA also lodged a complaint with the SAHRC over McKenzies live video remarks andthe resurfaced tweets.\n\nActionSA Member of Parliament Alan Beesley emphasised the partys commitment to combating racism, stating: We are confronting racism in all its forms by holding a sitting Cabinet Minister accountable for comments that no reasonable person can defend as anything other than racist and demeaning.\n\nHe warned that if necessary, the matter would be escalated to the Equality Court under the Promotion of Equality and Prevention of Unfair Discrimination Act.\n\nMcKenzie denied being racist, claiming the controversy was a politically motivated campaign orchestrated by the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF)and social media influencers. He admitted to the offensive posts but said they were written in response to racist remarks from others and expressed embarrassment over them.\n\nHe said, This whole campaign to find something racist I ever said is hilarious because you have now gone 13 years back and cant bring out one racist thing I ever said.\n\nThe Economic Freedom Fighters added their voice to calls from ATM and ActionSA, demanding McKenzies immediate removal from his ministerial position.\n\nMcKenzieannounced he would submit himself to an investigation.He said, I can never be guilty of racism, try some other take down but never racism.\n\nHe acknowledged tweeting some insensitive, stupid and hurtful things a decade or two ago, adding, I was a troll [and] stupid.I cringe when seeing them and I am truly sorry for that.\n\nHe denied any racist intent, citing his background: My mother was black and I have children with a black woman. I fought my whole life for the same treatment between black and Coloured people because we fought the same struggle.\n\nWhile McKenzie said he is truly sorry for the comments made years ago, a formal apology has not yet been issued.\n\n",
