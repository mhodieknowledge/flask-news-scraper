            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nZIMBABWE risks plunging into an energy abyss that could severely undermine its economic prospects if it fails to address its ongoing power challenges, a parliamentary report has revealed.\n\nThe dossier, recently tabled by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Energy and Power Development, paints a bleak picture of the countrys electricity situation.\n\nIt revealed the significant challenges faced by the Zimbabwe Power Company (ZPC), which have led to critically low levels of electricity production.\n\nCurrently, Zimbabwes main power sources are operating far below their capacity. While these sources have a combined generation capacity of 2,570 megawatts (MW), they are producing only 1,079 MW, leaving the country with a staggering deficit of 1,560 MW.\n\nTo bridge this gap, the national utility has been forced to import electricity from neighbouring countries.\n\nThe portfolio committee warned that the situation could deteriorate further if medium and long-term solutions are not implemented urgently.\n\nHowever, in as much as the transmission and distribution lines are functioning well, ZESA management highlighted that Zimbabwe is still facing serious power outages because the distribution supply of electricity is not meeting the nations demand.\n\nThe committee noted that the major challenge is of all power plants are not producing their optimum capacity.\n\nThe committee cited that considering the state we are in as a country, if there are no strategies that are going to be implemented sooner to boost generation, the nation will be suffering for a long haul, reads the report.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) has attributed the shortfall to outdated power infrastructure, the impacts of climate change, and the theft and vandalism of power lines and substations.\n\nThe low power generation has resulted in widespread load-shedding, with residential areas experiencing power cuts lasting more than 12 hours daily.\n\nSpeaking in Parliament recently, Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) Member of Parliament, Ropafadzo Makumire, said there are far-reaching implications of the electricity crisis on key sectors of the economy, particularly healthcare.\n\nIn the health sector, you find that there are machines like ventilators which use electricity. It means that in the district hospitals where there are no dedicated lines, there will be no electricity.\n\nSo, major surgical operations cannot go ahead in this state. It means that people die because of lack of electricity and people who will be forced to walk for long distances are brought here in Harare.\n\nThis then increases the number of people being assisted. If you look at the mortuaries where these bodies are placed, you find that it is not accessible because the bodies will be in a decomposing state. This matter should be looked at with urgency so that we do not continue with this predicament, said Makumire.\n\n",

But because Im ugly, they wrote about me. I was harassed for like five years and it made my life a living hell.\n\nThe comedian added that the scrutiny was, pretty humiliating and upsetting.\n\nDavidson rose to fame after he landed an audition through SNL alum, Bill Hader, according to NBC.\n\nHe joined the cast at the age of 20 in 2014 and left the live comedy show in 2022.\n\nThe Staten Island native hoped that fans would focus on his work on Saturday Night Live rather than his love life.\n\nDavidson continued to call the scrutiny, embarrassing because you want people to write about your work.\n\n[I] was one of the youngest ever cast members on SNL and all that got pushed to the side because of who I was dating, he remarked.\n\nIve had some pretty adult relationships with some pretty amazing women, and when its ended its been cool.\n\nHim and Arian Grande split after five months, leading Grande to create her Grammy-nominated breakup album, thank u, next. And Davidson moved on rather quickly to another celebrity, actress Kate Beckinsale.\n\nAfter splitting from Beckinsale in April 2019, the actor and stand-up comedian navigated other high-profile romances  many of them short-lived.\n\nDavidson was also linked to Margaret Qualley and model Kaia Gerber.\n\nIn 2021, Davidson and actress Phoebe Dynevor reportedly split after five months together just as Davidson started filming the rom-com Meet Cute with actress Kaley Cuoco. Dynevor started production on season 2 of her Netflix series, Bridgerton at the time.\n\nTheir relationship was over by summer 2021.\n\nLater that year, Davidson jumped into a relationship with The Kardashians star Kim Kardashian. The two became a couple after Kardashian hosted Saturday Night Live in October 2021, and after weeks of claiming they were just friends, they confirmed their relationship in November 2021.\n\nAfter nine months of dating, Davidson and Kardashian went their separate ways in August 2022.\n\nIn 2022, Kardashian shared why she believes a lot of hot girls have been in a relationship with The King of Staten Island star.\n\nPete has the best heart, the SKIMS founder previously shared on an episode of Hulus The Kardashians.\n\nI feel like people, they have this, like, idea of him that he dates all these hot girls  and he does. But hes just the sweetest, most thoughtful person, she said of the Saturday Night Live alum.\n\nShortly after his relationship with Kardashian, he continued to prove he was Hollywoods most eligible bachelor.\n\nRumors swirled that he dated model Emily Ratajkowski, as they were spotted courtside at the New York Knicks game in November 2022 at Madison Square Garden for their first public date night.\n\nThe following year, Davidson seemingly rid himself of one of his most famous tattoos  a tribute to his ex-girlfriend Kardashian.\n\n",
