Thats being reflected in stronger company results, a 45% rise in the dollar-based Victoria Falls stock exchange and a property boom.\n\nIts also helping the ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, which was launched in April 2024 and marked the sixth effort to establish a viable local currency after high inflation and collapsing foreign-exchange values scuppered previous attempts.\n\nIt has only weakened by 3% against the dollar this year amid tight monetary policy, a far cry from the collapses suffered by its predecessors.\n\nStill, the Harare-based asset manager warned that fragility remains with the nations unsustainable debt levels a threat. Fiscal pressures forced Zimbabwes Treasury last month to order spending cuts to government ministries. It owes creditors $21 billion after defaulting in 1999 and efforts to seek a debt revamp have so far failed to yield fruit.\n\n",

We were not expecting it, you know. There were about children, magogos (old women), you know, Dennis Jakopo spoke to the television news channel.\n\nHe said the ill-fated bus left the rank in Gqeberha on Saturday at around 3 pm, embarking on the 2,100-kilometer journey to Harare. In Harare, the Malawian passengers were scheduled to be transferred to another DNC bus, according to Jakopo.\n\nIts so sad to receive such news. We are sorry guys to all the families who lost their relatives, yeah, we are very sorry, he said.\n\nOther representatives of the company were, on Monday morning, said to be travelling to the crash scene, even though the horrific crash happened on Sunday afternoon.\n\nIm sure in an hour or two hours they will be there with enough information and here at the office we are also trying to get in touch with the next of kin, Jakopo said.\n\nHe said the Harare-bound 61-seater bus was carrying two drivers and one host.\n\nIn his condolences message, President Ramaphosa said the tragedy was compounded by the fact that it occurred during Transport Month, a time when South Africa highlights the importance of road safety.\n\nThis incident is a tragedy for South Africa and our sister states of Zimbabwe and Malawi alike. Our roads are economic networks that bring the people of our region together across our national borders.\n\nWe must do everything we can as road users, as transport operators, drivers and passengers to ensure that we stay safe and that we share our roads responsibly and with care for one another, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has ruled that businessman Murombo Josiah Mimana must continue supporting his estranged wife, Marvel Mtisi, with monthly maintenance after finding that he had the capacity to pay for the familys upkeep, previously pegged at US$20,000 per month.\n\nJustice Maxwell delivered the judgment on October 9, 2025, granting Mtisi maintenance of US$11,726 per month and ordering Mimana to contribute 80% of her legal costs pending the conclusion of their divorce proceedings.\n\nThe couple, married under an unregistered customary union in 2001, has eight children. Mtisi approached the court seeking a declaration that the marriage had ended and for Mimana to resume the US$20,000 monthly payments he allegedly stopped in February 2025, despite having consistently paid that amount since March 2024.\n\nMtisi told the court she was unemployed and had been excluded from the couples lucrative businesses, despite holding a 50% stake. She said the companies were financially sound, citing lucrative Jet A1 fuel supply contracts and profitable mining operations. She argued Mimana was well able to meet the US$21,936 in monthly expenses and contribute to her legal costs.\n\nMimana denied personally paying the US$20,000, claiming it was the company that had made the payments for the upkeep of the family. He accused Mtisi of failing to account for the funds and said payments stopped after she engaged in activities that disrupted the smooth running of the company.\n\nHe further disputed that she was a shareholder and insisted she was not entitled to dividends or business proceeds.\n\nBut in his ruling, Justice Fatima Maxwell found that Mimana had the means to continue supporting his wife, noting that even if the company had made the payments, it acted on his behalf.\n\nIt is common cause that the applicant has been dependent on the US$20,000 per month she was getting. The bottom line is that she has no source of income except the contribution she was receiving, the judge said.\n\nRespondent has not disputed that he is unilaterally running the company and that the US$20,000 was being paid on his behalf. He is therefore in a position to contribute to the applicants legal costs whether personally or through the company.\n\nThe court trimmed some nonrecurring and tutoring costs from Mtisis claim, disallowing US$10,210 in total, leaving US$11,726 as the payable monthly amount.\n\nOn Mimanas technical objection that Mtisis affidavit was improperly commissioned, the court described it as a desperate attempt by the respondent to avoid going into the merits of the matter.\n\nThe application for maintenance pendente lite and contribution towards costs be and is hereby granted,  she ruled.\n\n",

Emergency services, including paramedics, transport officers, and law enforcement officials, responded swiftly, recovering the deceased and transporting injured passengers to nearby hospitals.\n\nPremier Ramathuba is scheduled to visit the crash site at 11 am on Monday to meet the multi-disciplinary emergency team for updates. She will later address the media and visit hospitals where the injured are receiving care.\n\nThis is a heartbreaking tragedy. Losing so many lives in one incident is painful beyond words. On behalf of the Limpopo Provincial Government, we extend our deepest condolences to the affected families, including those in Zimbabwe and Malawi. We wish a full and speedy recovery to all survivors. Our thoughts and prayers are with them during this difficult time, Ramathuba said.\n\nEarlier, Limpopo Transport MEC Violet Mathye confirmed that the deceased included a 10-month-old baby. She said driver fatigue or a possible mechanical fault could have caused the bus to lose control, though investigations are ongoing.\n\nThe N1 freeway was temporarily closed following the crash. Motorists were advised to use alternative routes: from Makhado to Musina via the Witvlag turnoff, and from Musina to Makhado via the Williespoort turnoff.\n\nThe tragedy follows reports that the bus carried passengers from Zimbabwe and Malawi who were returning home for personal reasons. Rescue operations continued late into Sunday evening, with law enforcement and transport officials coordinating efforts alongside disaster management teams.\n\nThe Limpopo government is also providing psychosocial support to survivors and working with consular services from Zimbabwe and Malawi to assist affected families. Traffic authorities and the South African Police Service continue to investigate the cause of the crash.\n\n",
