            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nDEPUTY President of Senate Michael Nyambuya has described as sad the propensity of absconding Question-and-Answer sessions by the countrys two vice presidents and Cabinet ministers.\n\nThe worrisome trend denies citizens vital information about government policies, programmes and projects.\n\nSpeaker of Parliament, Jacob Mudenda has, on several occasions, noted the undesirable trend and ordered punitive action to be taken against errant top government officials skipping parliamentary Q and A sessions.\n\nThis Thursday, Hon Nyambuya was unassumed by the absence of Vice President Constantino Chiwenga and his counterpart, Kembo Mohadi, and a huge chunk of Cabinet ministers and their deputies, who missed the important deliberations in the Upper House.\n\nToday is Thursday and following the Standing Orders, we start with Questions Without Notice. As usual, I have a very long list of apologies, sadly, said Nyambuya, before reading the list of absentee office bearers.\n\nThe list of apologies is as follows; Hon. General Rtd. Dr. C. D. G. N. Chiwenga, the Vice President; Hon. Colonel Rtd. K. C. D Mohadi, the Vice President; Hon. M. Ncube, Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion; Hon. Machakaire, the Minister of Youth Empowerment, Development and Vocational Training; Hon. Murwira, Minister of Foreign Affairs and International Trade; Hon. Kazembe, Minister of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage; Hon. Mavetera, the Minister of ICT, Postal and Courier Services; Hon. M. Ndlovu, the Minister of Industry and Commerce; Hon. F. Mhona, Minister of Transport and Infrastructural Development.\n\nHe went further, Hon. J.G, Moyo, Minister of Energy and Power Development; Hon. K. D. Mnangagwa, the Deputy Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion; Hon. E. Jesaya, Deputy Minister of Sports, Recreation, Arts and Culture; Hon. J. Mhlanga, Deputy Minister of Women Affairs, Community, Small and Medium Enterprises Development; Hon. C. Sanyatwe, Deputy Minister of Home Affairs and Cultural Heritage; Hon. Mazungunye, Deputy Minister of Justice, Legal and Parliamentary Affairs; Hon. A.\n\nGata, Deputy Minister of Primary and Secondary Education; Hon. R. Modi, Deputy Minister of Industry and Commerce; Hon. Y. Simbanegavi, Deputy Minister of Energy and Power Development; Hon. M. Ncube, Deputy Minister of National Housing and Social Amenities and Hon. D. Marapira, Deputy Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Resettlement.\n\nOnly Primary and Secondary Education minister, Torerai Moyo and two deputies were in the august House, which is emblematic of a skewed work ethic.\n\nIn the Chamber today, we have Hon. T. Moyo, Minister of Primary and Secondary Education; Hon. O. Marupi, Deputy Minister of Information, Publicity and Broadcasting Services and Hon. D. Phuti, Deputy Minister of ICT.\n\nCan we then start with those ministers who are present and hopefully, we will be joined by other ministers as we progress? said the Senate deputy president.\n\nA number of Cabinet ministers are under fire for not attending Parliament business, a development that has incensed Mudenda.\n\nRecently, the Speaker revealed that most Cabinet ministers give apologies on the pretext of being on national duty, something he said should be investigated.\n\nThe Q & A session is one of the most important Parliament business schedules where the public gets answers to policy questions asked by their constituency representatives (MPs) from Cabinet ministers.\n\nIn recent years, the two VPs and ministers have evaded the session, leaving citizens starved of crucial information needed to track progress of elected officials.\n\nSeveral MPs have raised their concerns since the previous Parliament until now (10th Parliament), with the Speaker at one point threatening to report culprits to President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nAfter listening to this, there are quite clear apologies that have been very consistent to you. And my suspicion is that these ministers who make apologies cannot be on national duty every week, Mudenda lamented.\n\nMnangagwa has also issued a stern warning to Cabinet ministers, who habitually skip his weekly Cabinet meetings, delegating their deputies to attend in their place.\n\nWhile chairing his final cabinet meeting of 2024 at State House, December 17, Mnangagwa warned that such delegation would not be tolerated in 2025.\n\nHe said in the 2025 calendar year, the Chief Secretary is directed to strictly monitor attendance and ensure that errant ministers and officials toe the line, or face dire consequences.\n\n",

For Simbisa, the countrys largest fast-food company, the year began with fresh taxes that could bite into sales.\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncube initially proposed a 0.5% tax in his budget statement, only to bump it up to 1% for implementation in January. He also threw in a new 20% tax on plastic bags.\n\nThis came as consumer spending in Simbisa outlets dipped. Average spend per customer fell by 3% in the last half-year, even though customer numbers rose by 7% to 24.8 million. This means the company has had to absorb the costs while finding ways to bridge the gap. Its strategy? Open more outlets, sell more chicken, and manage costs better.\n\nWere adapting to the 1% fast-food tax, says CEO Basil Dionisio.\n\nOn January 1, we all woke up to a lovely new year, and we were told its half a percent. Then the SI came out, and its 1%. We havent raised prices. Were absorbing itby growing our customer base, increasing volume, and passing that benefit to consumers.\n\nSimbisa opened a net of 38 new outlets between December 2023 and the end of 2024, with 16 of those in the last half of the year. By June, another 10 outlets will be added. Over the next 18 months, the company plans to launch 81 new counters and refurbish 60 existing ones.\n\nAnd what about the plastic bags tax?\n\nWe want to transition to 100% paper packagingno more little plastic carrier bags, Dionisio says.\n\nThis shift aligns with global industry trends. The company is also exploring new sustainable packaging solutions for its Creamy Inn ice creams.\n\nAfter that, we should have no more plastic in our operations.\n\nBeyond opening new outlets, Simbisa is also betting on increased adoption of its delivery services, which remain low in Zimbabwe compared to other markets.\n\nThe company is increasing cost containment, including pushing energy savings, while working with suppliers to negotiate better terms.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nZIMBABWES governing party, Zanu PF is in the process of crafting a digital media policy to rein in its members and affiliates, who have been at loggerheads with some leaders as internal conflicts persist.\n\nThe envisaged policy was submitted to the Politburo Wednesday for consideration as the party frets over members abusing social media.\n\nAddressing the media at the party headquarters recently, Zanu PF secretary for legal affairs, Patrick Chinamasa, said there are members who are using social media to cause instability within the party.\n\nThe national political commissar is chairing a committee to come up a Zanu PF social media management policy. We found that the party has suffered a lot of harm from what goes on on social media.\n\nWhat we do not approve is a Zanu PF cadre, a member of Zanu PF from the cell right up to the president, use social media to criticise colleagues. The channels are there. We are hopeful the social media policy that is to be crafted will assist not entirely or help assist put order and discipline and unity within our party, said Chinamasa.\n\nZanu PF has been struggling to contain its members and affiliates, some of which were ostensibly created to support President Emmerson Mnangagwa. One of the affiliates, Varakashi for ED, recently criticised Chinamasa after he warned them about bringing the party into disrepute.\n\nThey have been accused of fanning factionalism, going against President Mnangagwas public declaration of not seeking re-election.\n\nDespite some of the affiliates having been established to counter the narrative of the opposition using digital media, some have reflected Zanu PFs divisions, with members split between supporting Mnangagwa and his deputy, Constantino Chiwenga, who is touted to be next in the partys succession plan.\n\nChinamasa said once the digital media policy has been approved, Zanu PF will nip in the bud any members going against the party.\n\nThe party is going to put its foot down on issues to do with WhatsApp exchanges. We have developed technology to detect who are the ghost people. A lot of people have been masquerading under ghost accounts. We have technology to tell who is a ghost. This time we will be able to uncover who are the ghosts doing all these things, he said.\n\nZanu PF recently purged and suspended members who were accused of spreading divisive messages using social media.\n\n",
