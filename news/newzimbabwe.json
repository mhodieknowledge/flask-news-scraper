            "content": "By BBC\n\nTHE trial of Diego Maradonas medical staff has collapsed in Argentina after it was found that a judge involved in the case had taken part in a documentary about it.\n\nThe judge in charge of the proceedings said the trial, which began on 11 March and was expected to last until July, would have to start again.Seven members of Maradonas medical team were charged with negligent homicide relating to the former footballers death in 2020. They deny the allegations.One of the three presiding judges, Julieta Makintach, stepped down this week.Maradona, a former Napoli and Argentina midfielder, had been recovering at his home in Buenos Aires from brain surgery for a blood clot in November 2020 when he died of a heart attack, aged 60.Among the medical team on trial are a neurosurgeon, a doctor and a night nurse. They claim the retired footballer refused further treatment and should have stayed at home for longer after his operation.If convicted, they face between eight and 25 years in prison.Earlier this week, Prosecutor Patricio Ferrari accused Makintach of behaving like an actress and not a judge after she took part in a documentary about the case.As a trailer for the documentary series, called Divine Justice, was played in court, defence lawyer Rodolfo Baque shouted trash! at Makintach.Maradonas daughter Gianinna and his former partner Veronica Ojeda both cried after seeing the footage.It is a violation of court rules for unauthorised filming to take place and the documentary was being filmed without the permission of the court.Following criticism for taking part in the show, Makintach said she had no choice but to excuse herself from the case.The trial was then adjourned pending the decision on Thursday, which ultimately was to declare a mistrial.Since beginning, the trial had heard the testimony of almost 50 witnesses, including Maradonas daughters.The date for the new trial was not initially set and new judges were not nominated.\n\nThe judge in charge of the proceedings said the trial, which began on 11 March and was expected to last until July, would have to start again.\n\nSeven members of Maradonas medical team were charged with negligent homicide relating to the former footballers death in 2020.

Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked.We must pray that our leaders are granted the wisdom and discernment to see the struggles of the people they serve, especially in our rural areas where the affliction of hunger is most prevalent and severe.Thanksgiving for efforts madeLet us also take a moment to express our gratitude for the efforts already made by our government and local authorities. They are striving to provide for their people, and we commend them for this. However, it is clear that more needs to be done.We must uplift our leaders in prayer, asking God to inspire them to increase their feeding initiatives and ensure that every resident has access to the food they need.A prayer for our leadershipHeavenly Father, we come before You with heavy hearts. We lift up our leaders in Zimbabwe and ask that You grant them the vision to see the plight of those who are hungry and in need.

Built at a cost of US$88m, the interchange is a shoddy, vulgar sobriquet of raw looting and grandiose theft of public funds, Biti wrote on his X account Saturday.\n\nThe US$88m is way out of line with comparative regional projects that have cost significantly less. For instance, SAs Mount Edgecombe project, the biggest in Africa which cost US$70 million.\n\nThe former Treasury chief also labelled Mnangagwas government as a mafia group, which bypassed tender processes and awarded the contract to build such a huge project to Mnangagwas alleged cronies.\n\nThe project was not subject to international tender but instead was awarded to a local cartel and its associates, that has been at the centre of massive looting of public coffers since 2017.\n\nThe cartel has been the biggest recipient of all Treasury Bills issued in this country and has been active in Command Agriculture, mining, fuel, banking, financial services, buses, roads, hospitals, retail and general procurement, he said.\n\nBiti called on Parliament to carry out a forensic audit to establish how the project was funded, saying the entire financing process has been opaque, contrary to Public Finance Management principles, which emphasise on transparency and accountability.\n\nThese questions arise because of the predatory veil of opaqueness that has been the MO (modus operandi) of the regime. Parliament must cause a forensic audit of this project and examining legal financial & engineering constructs of this pagoda. Corruption must stop.\n\nMeanwhile, the public, through social media, has voiced concerns regarding the project and expressed shock that it cost US$88 million, attacking Mnangagwa and his government as corrupt leaders.\n\n",
