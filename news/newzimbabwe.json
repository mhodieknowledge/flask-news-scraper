            "content": "The Globe and Mail\n\nThe documentaryMbira Talks, about a Zimbabwean-Canadian musicians relationship with an instrument once banned during colonisation, took a long time to make. We know this because Moyo Rainos Mutamba is shown plucking his mbira on a Toronto street, with the glittering Honest Eds department store in the background.\n\nThe lights went out in that building in 2016, and it was torn down a year later. Director Adrienne Amato originally planned to make a film about Stella Chiweshe, the pioneering rebel queen of the instrument, often referred to as a thumb piano because of the metal tines affixed to a wooden board that are struck by the first digits of the human hand.\n\nLogistics sabotaged the film on Chiweshe, who died in 2023 at age 76. Amato, who is white and was born in Zimbabwe when it was still under British rule as Rhodesia, immigrated to Toronto in 1977. After Chiweshes death, she shifted her focus to Mutamba. Still, the documentary, which premieres online and at the South African Film Festival in Toronto on Monday, took years to make, mostly because of money.\n\nIts very specific what gets funding these days, said the filmmaker, who joined Mutamba on a video call. Unless you have a celebrity in your doc or its a whodunnit crime thing, its a difficult landscape for making documentaries these days.\n\nAmato did not have a celebrity in her film, but she and Mutamba did have one on their side. Canadian indie-pop star Leslie Feist donated her frequent-flier miles for the trip to Africa by Amato, Mutamba and cinematographer Tess Girard. She also helped pay for the digging of a well at the Ubuntu Learning Village, the educational and community hub Mutamba co-founded in rural Zimbabwe.\n\nMutamba came to Canada more than 20 years ago to study economics at Trent University in Peterborough, Ont. The self-described village human finds Toronto too loud and crowded. In 2007, longing for a connection with his homeland, he took up the mbira, a ceremonial instrument tied to traditions of the Shona culture.\n\nThe late Chiweshe called the mbira a telephone to the spirits of people, water, trees and birds. Deeming it subversive, Rhodesias white authorities and Christian missionaries banned the instrument. The mbira is part of Mutambas educational mission involving food sovereignty, arts and cultural reclamation.\n\nIm intrigued by the power of community, he said. People are searching for it. Were all searching for village.\n\nFormer Toronto landmark Honest Eds can be seen across the street from Mutamba in a still from the documentary.Supplied\n\nMutamba is both a facilitator and a searcher himself. He longs for home, but Toronto is where he earns a living as co-director of Bloom Consulting, specializing in strategic planning, conflict mediation and psychotherapy. Canadas wealthy biggest city is his hunting place, where money is made to be used in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe mbira is more popular in Western Canada than in its eastern counterpart  Vancouver Island is the hotbed. Though the instrument is foreign to Canada, Mutamba believes its effect is universal.\n\nIt provokes certain emotions, he said. It is in the body. Its beyond the otherness. It is a sound that is human.\n\n",

Kriel said the organisations campaign against the policy was motivated by what it saw as the potentially catastrophic consequences for all South Africans.\n\nAmong the measures AfriForum is proposing are:\n\nOn property rights, AfriForum has called for amendments to the Expropriation Act, including the scrapping of Section 12(3), which allows for expropriation without compensation.\n\nAfriForum said it is set to launch a report regarding what it termed the violation of minorities human rights in South Africa.\n\nLast week,IOL reported that Argentinas President Javier Milei will not attend the G20 leaders summit in Johannesburg, aligning witha boycott of the key meeting backed by United States President Donald Trump.\n\nAccording to reports in Argentine media, Milei will instead send Foreign Minister Pablo Quirno to represent the country, along with G20 negotiator Federico Pinedo.\n\nThe decision marks a show of solidarity with Trump, who announced that the United States would not participate in the G20 summit in South Africa, citing alleged human-rights abuses against Afrikaner farmers in the country.\n\nArgentinas government has not issued an official statement on the withdrawal, but presidential aides quoted in local outlets said the move was in line with Washingtons position.\n\n",

Citizens were subjected to forced displacements, politically motivated assaults, hate-driven attacks, and threats of violence, while fundamental rights to freedom of assembly, association, and expression were routinely curtailed, reads the report.\n\nOf those affected, 1,360 were women and 1,171 were men, including 109 persons with disabilities.\n\nThe watchdog urged authorities to strengthen human rights protections, ensure transparent delivery of public services, and establish safe reporting mechanisms that protect victims from retaliation.\n\nThe actions of ruling party supporters, local authorities, police, and traditional leaders illustrate how political power is often leveraged to intimidate, coerce, and control communities, eroding public trust and reinforcing inequalities.\n\nZimbabwe must urgently improve protections for civic and political rights, ensure fair and transparent delivery of public services, and create strong, safe systems for reporting abuses. These steps are needed to protect victims from retaliation and to make sure human rights are genuinely respected, not just promised in law.\n\nZanu PF has repeatedly been cited this year as the main perpetrator of human rights violations in Zimbabwe.\n\n",
