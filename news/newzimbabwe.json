            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has compelled all exporters to surrender 30% of their earned foreign currency in exchange for the ZWG at the obtaining interbank exchange rate.\n\nPresenting the Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) premised under the theme, Fostering Price, Currency and Exchange Rate Stability Through Balancing Confidence, Trust, Credibility, Efficiency, Stability Growth the RBZ Governor John Mushayavanhu ordered exporters to surrender more US$.\n\nThe foreign currency retention level for exporters has been reduced from 75% to 70%, with immediate effect. This implies that the effective surrender portion of export proceeds has been increased from 25% to 30%, he said.\n\nHe said the initiative is aimed at guaranteeingcontinued stability in the interbank foreign exchange market through augmenting the supply of foreign currency, as well as building the critical foreign currency reserves needed to anchor the ZWG.\n\nHowever, the initiative to raise foreign currency by taking away the hard-earned US$ from the exporters comes at a time when most companies are crying foul over due to choking shortages of foreign currency.\n\nIndications on the ground are that the measure is likely to complicate an already tough situation.\n\nThis review is consistent with the increased use of ZiG in the economy. The additional 5% will ensure that exporters mobilise sufficient ZiG to meet local currency obligations and other expenses, including tax payments, going forward, said Mushayavanhu.\n\nThe central bank also moved to introduce a US Dollar Denominated Deposit Facility (USDDDF) where the export surrender proceeds will have an option to invest the funds in a USDDDF at the RBZ which they can withdraw in ZWG on demand, at the prevailing interbank exchange rate on the settlement date.\n\nGoing forward, Authorized Dealers are expected to on-sell foreign exchange purchased from willing sellers, including the RBZ at a margin consistent with international best practices.\n\nThe limits on funds that can be accessed from the Foreign Exchange Interbank Market had been set at US$500,000 and US$100,000 for Primary and Secondary users of foreign exchange, respectively, per week. The central bank issued streamlined Foreign Exchange Interbank Market Guidelines to operationalise the refinements on the exchange rate management system and removal of foreign exchange trading limits.\n\nIn order to promote the use of prepaid international debit and credit cards, the Reserve Bank has, with immediate effect, reviewed upwards the annual limit from US$500,000 to US$1,000,000. This review will also enhance the ease of doing business and reduce the use of foreign currency cash for cross-border transactions, the exchequer said.\n\nThe Bank Policy Rate was maintained at 35% per annum, as assessed to be appropriate to support the current tight Monetary Policy Stance (MPS).\n\n",

            "content": "TimesLive\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa used his State of the Nation Address to send a strong message to his countrys detractors, warning that the South Africa he leads will not cower to bullies.\n\nSouth Africa, he said, was very capable of navigating the ever-changing and treacherous waters of the world and its geopolitics.\n\nHe said the country was witnessing the rise of nationalism, protectionism and the pursuit of narrow interests by global leaders.\n\nThis is the world that we, a developing economy, must now navigate. But we are not daunted to navigate our path through this world that constantly changes, said Ramaphosa.\n\nWe will not be deterred. We are a resilient people and we will not be bullied.\n\nThis stern message by Ramaphosa, which received loud applause and cheers in the National Assembly, comes after South Africa was in the past two weeks under an international microscope after leaders of the US and Rwanda censured the country.\n\nIt started with Rwandas Paul Kagame, who along with government officials criticised the presence of South African troops in the eastern DRC, claiming it was not for peacekeeping but to protect financial interests of many, including Ramaphosa himself.\n\nKagame also accused Ramaphosa of lying on the outcomes of their telephone conversation, where Ramaphosa is said to have warned that the continued firing towards the South African troops by M23 and the Rwandan Defence Force would be viewed as a declaration of war.\n\nUS President Donald Trump also zoomed into the affairs of South Africa this week, voicing what he says are concerns over the Expropriation Act that Ramaphosa signed into law.\n\nHe claimed that the country under Ramaphosa was doing very wrong things and that there was confiscation of private properties.\n\nBut Ramaphosa said South Africa had survived apartheid, which sought to dehumanise its people, suggesting the county would also defend and survive this.\n\nWe will stand together and speak with one voice in defence of our national interests, our sovereignty and our constitutional democracy by standing true to our values, by harnessing our unique strengths and endowments, and by forging a common purpose we can turn these trying circumstances to our advantage and propel our country forward.\n\nHe said South Africa stood for peace and justice, equality and solidarity. We stand for a non-racial future and we stand for democracy and tolerance as well as compassion. We stand for equal rights for women and people living with disability and members of the LGBTQIA+ community. We stand for our shared humanity, not for the survival of the fittest, he said.\n\nHis comments come after he had a telephonic conversation with Trumps right hand-man Elon Musk to try to explain that their view on what was happening in South Africa was completely wrong.\n\n",

This has also ensured the full coverage of the total ZiG deposits in the economy of around ZiG13 billion, thereby supporting the Reserve Banks currency and exchange rate stability objectives, RBZ governor, John Mushayavanhu said.\n\nThe central bank said the reserves accumulation strategy is centred on ensuring that, at any point, the ZiG component of reserve money is fully backed.\n\nBased on the current trends of foreign exchange inflows, including in-kind royalties, the RBZ believes the reserve accumulation strategy for 2025 will result in a significant improvement in foreign reserve holdings at the Reserve Bank.\n\n",

For those due for (Antiretroviral Treatment) ART or PrEP refills, please proceed to the nearest city health clinic for assistance. Thank you for understanding, the notice states.\n\nPrEP is a medication that can help reduce your risk of contracting HIV through sexual contact.\n\nSome officials confirmed that testing services are the only offerings at this time.\n\nThe clinic is only open for those who want to be tested for HIV. We are currently not offering other services, officials at the reception explained.\n\nA similar situation is being reported in Masvingo.\n\nThe centre has typically provided integrated clinical services that included HIV testing, PrEP, TB screening and treatment, cervical cancer screening and treatment, as well as short-term and long-acting reversible contraceptives, and sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening and treatment, among other services.\n\nUpon his inauguration, Trump announced a range of changes to the United States funding model, emphasizing reasonable use of taxpayers money and prioritizing developments within the superpower itself.\n\nThis policy shift has led to millions of US dollars in funding being paused for local civil society organizations (CSOs), impacting billions globally.\n\nGiven that the United States is a significant funder of development in both the health and education sectors of Zimbabwe, there are growing concerns regarding the potential ramifications of these changes.\n\nThe US plays a crucial role in Zimbabwes efforts to combat sexually transmitted diseases and HIV, with PEPFAR providing funding for the majority of condoms and antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) distributed by local hospitals.\n\nCurrently, approximately 1.2 million Zimbabweans benefit from PEPFAR, and over 1,600 public hospitals and clinics have received training and technical support from the US government.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nHarare Mayor Jacob Mafume has pointed the finger at his wife in the growing controversy surrounding a luxury hostel inspection report he is building in Belvedere. Mafume told the retired High Court Judge Justice Maphios Cheda-led Commission of Inquiry today that his wife is overseeing the construction of the hostel intended to accommodate over 60 Harare Institute of Technology (HIT) students.\n\nThe property, allegedly acquired through kickbacks from South African firm Quill Associates (involved in Harare City Councils Enterprise Resource Plan), was reportedly built without adhering to council regulations regarding planning and inspection.\n\nMafume presented the commission with an inspection report showing six visits to the property in a single month, sometimes just three days apart, all seemingly documented with the same pen.\n\nTapiwa Fresh Godzi, leading the commissions evidence, questioned the speed of construction. I wonder at what rate the builders are working. Inspection after inspection every three days. Is that reasonable? he asked.Mafume maintained it was reasonable.\n\nCommission chairperson Justice Cheda inquired about the identity of the inspector. Mafume admitted he had never met the person face to face.\n\nThese people approving this building all have the same signature, correct? Justice Cheda asked. Mafume confirmed this and again, implicated his wife in the inspection furore.\n\nI have not met the inspector personally. They visit the site where there is a contractor. This is being handled by my wife, he stated.\n\nNewZimbabwe.com has learned that the City Council has no record of Mafume paying for any of the six inspections he presented to the commission. Sources say Mafume himself lacks receipts to prove payment.\n\nPayment is required for each inspection stage by city officials. Mafume made no payments and has no proof of payment for any of the inspections, a source stated.\n\nDuring his testimony, Mafume admitted he had not obtained council approval to change the propertys use from residential to commercial. Such changes require approval from the works and town planning committee, but Mafume made no application, and no committee meeting minutes exist approving the renovations.\n\nThe change of use plan does not exist. That one is not there, said a noticeably nervous Mafume.\n\nChange-of-use plans are typically paid for before construction begins.\n\nA typical building plan for the hostel Mafume is building costs around United States Dollars three thousand, which he has not paid to the council, a source said.\n\nThis represents a violation of by-laws that Mafume, as Harares mayor, is expected to uphold.\n\nAnother source claims Mafume used intermediaries to handle the hostel construction and the purchase of a Greendale mansion, avoiding direct involvement.\n\nThis, the source believes, was a strategy to evade scrutiny, but his shady deals have now come back to haunt him.\n\n",
