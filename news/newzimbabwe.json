            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nZIMBABWEs land reform programme of the year 2000 was necessary for the country to put its black people at the forefront of productive agriculture, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has said.\n\nOfficially opening this years Zimbabwe Agricultural Show (ZAS) in Harare this Friday, Ramaphosa commended the Government of Zimbabwe for the momentous task of dismantling colonial-era patterns of land ownership where the black majority was confined to communal lands.On independence in 1980, the new democratic Government of Zimbabwe had to take on the momentous task of dismantling colonial-era patterns of land ownership.Most of the countrys commercially productive land and large-scale commercial farms were owned by whites. The black majority was confined to communal lands and all but completely excluded from commercial farming.This mirrored our own experience in South Africa.It was, therefore, essential for both historical redress and food security, development and economic growth that the government embarked on ambitious reforms to facilitate the entry of black Zimbabweans into productive agriculture, including support to small-scale farmers, Ramaphosa said.He also congratulated Zimbabwe for the measures being taken to revive the countrys agricultural sector through policy reforms, investment in irrigation and mechanisation, and empowering large and small-scale farmers.We know that the agricultural sector has been heavily affected by the growing impacts of the changing climate.Severe drought has impacted crop yields in recent years.Adapting to and mitigating the effects of climate change are an imperative for all nations. Collaboration among countries is critical to the success of these efforts, added the South African President.He said: Biosecurity is another area in which Zimbabwe and South Africa must step up cooperation.Outbreaks of foot and mouth disease, avian or bird flu, crop infections and others, call on us to pool our resources and strengthen our collaboration, including through our respective research institutions.The SA President explained that technological trends in agriculture must be fully embraced to increase output and conserve resources.By way of example, geo-spacial agriculture using earth observation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has started to feature in some sectors of agriculture in South Africa and Zimbabwe.Such innovation will be key as we collectively build resilience in pursuit of food security, he stated.Even amidst these challenges, Ramaphosa said a constant feature at ZAS had been the commitment to use agriculture as a catalyst for economic growth, sustainable development and historical redress.The hosting of this agriculture show resonates with the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme, which seeks to improve domestic production and marketing as well as the facilitation of regional trade in food staples.It will also help to make our industries more competitive in the global trading market and to make use of the substantial opportunities of the African Continental Free Trade Area, he stated.According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), agriculture accounts for between 60 and 80 percent of employment in the region.We must, therefore, work towards a more enabling regulatory environment to further boost this sector.We need increased investment in small and medium farming entities, particularly those owned and run by women and the youth.President (Emmerson) Mnangagwa and I recently attended the SADC Summit in Madagascar, where agricultural transformation in the region was a major point of discussion.I call on the private sectors in both Zimbabwe and South Africa to use this show to explore avenues for great collaboration that will result in more trade and investment across our borders.Agricultural cooperation is key to sustaining jobs.We need investment in the provision of seeds, training, irrigation schemes, storage facilities and in agro-processing.The development of road, rail and aviation infrastructure is a key catalyst to take agriculture to an even higher level, Ramaphosa added.\n\nOfficially opening this years Zimbabwe Agricultural Show (ZAS) in Harare this Friday, Ramaphosa commended the Government of Zimbabwe for the momentous task of dismantling colonial-era patterns of land ownership where the black majority was confined to communal lands.\n\nOn independence in 1980, the new democratic Government of Zimbabwe had to take on the momentous task of dismantling colonial-era patterns of land ownership.Most of the countrys commercially productive land and large-scale commercial farms were owned by whites.

using earth observation and Artificial Intelligence (AI) has started to feature in some sectors of agriculture in South Africa and Zimbabwe.\n\nSuch innovation will be key as we collectively build resilience in pursuit of food security, he stated.Even amidst these challenges, Ramaphosa said a constant feature at ZAS had been the commitment to use agriculture as a catalyst for economic growth, sustainable development and historical redress.The hosting of this agriculture show resonates with the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme, which seeks to improve domestic production and marketing as well as the facilitation of regional trade in food staples.It will also help to make our industries more competitive in the global trading market and to make use of the substantial opportunities of the African Continental Free Trade Area, he stated.According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), agriculture accounts for between 60 and 80 percent of

            "content": "By James Muonwa\n\nCHINHOYI University of Technology (CUT) has achieved gender parity in the number of graduands churned out of the Class of 2025, amid a shift that witnessed more females than males graduating.\n\nDuring the universitys 21st graduation ceremony held on Thursday, a total of 3,130 graduands were capped by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is the Chancellor of all State universities.\n\nOf the graduating Class of 2025, there were 1,573 females and 1,557 males, marking a slight difference of 16.\n\nTraditionally, during previous graduation ceremonies, the number of male graduates surpassed that of females.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of the event held at CUT Grounds, womens rights lobbyist, Chioniso Gurupira, said the new trend was a positive sign of strides the country has made in empowering women and the girl-child.\n\nThe one thing that has probably struck some of us in the gender mainstreaming sector is the number of female graduands at this event. The women are slightly more than the men, which is a positive story of CUT having achieved gender parity, said Gurupira.\n\nGender parity refers to a situation where the number of females and males is roughly equal or balanced in a particular context, such as in education, the workforce, or leadership roles.\n\nIt implies equal representation, opportunities, and treatment of both genders.\n\nA female graduand, Jennifer Tinotenda Sanjobo, who graduated with a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Crop Science, expressed joy at having successfully completed her degree in a previously male-dominated study area, which will enable her to contribute meaningfully to national development.\n\nI am excited to have graduated with a BSc in Crop Science. We were a few ladies in our cohort and l feel proud to be among the graduands, said Sanjobo.\n\nI am hoping to use my newly acquired education and expertise to help Zimbabwe fight climate change by coming up with seed varieties that can adapt and withstand the rigours of the phenomenon.\n\nIn a small way, I am optimistic my contribution to climate-proofing agriculture will bring about food security and national development, she added.\n\nWhile CUT has managed to bring an equilibrium between the number of graduates based on gender, sadly total number of graduands tumbled this year to 3,130 from the 2024 figure, which stood at 3,545. In 2023, a total of 3,480 graduated from the same university.\n\nAddressing guests, CUT Vice Chancellor, Professor David Simbi lamented the low uptake of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) courses, which are the varsitys anchor areas of study.\n\nOur understanding as a higher education institution of our role is using research, innovation, science and technology development to drive and develop the industrialisation and modernisation of Zimbabwe to achieve a middle economic status by 2030\n\nHowever, our human capital development remains side lobbed in that there are too few STEM students in our programmes, despite the importance we attach to the related programmes of study, said Simbi.\n\nThis is, however, not peculiar to Zimbabwe, and there are other routes that we can use to meet this deficit that other countries with similar problems have adopted.\n\nTo this end, Your Excellency and Chancellor, CUT will be seriously investigating the introduction of foundation programmes in science, technology and engineering as pre-university basic technology education.\n\nSimbi noted that the approach is a common trend in the United Kingdom, Singapore and Malaysia, among other countries.\n\nThe vice chancellor also lamented the high cost of laboratory equipment, which he, however, said could be dealt with by adopting reverse engineering.\n\nSimbi told graduands that the Heritage-Based Education 5.0 philosophy had prepared them for the future.\n\nHeritage-based education has prepared you for the future. To the private sector, these graduates are ready to take on any challenge for the good of the country. In broader contribution, heritage-based education has gained greater meaning in the nation and beyond, towards industrialisation and modernisation, Simbi said.\n\n",
