            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo l IOL\n\nActionSA has slammed Home Affairs Minister Dr Leon Schreibers decision to extend the validity of the Zimbabwean Exemption Permits (ZEPs) until 28 May 2027, describing it as another sign of indecision and weakness from the government.\n\nIn a statement, ActionSA parliamentary chief whip Lerato Ngobeni MP said the extension showed the governments unwillingness to confront South Africas immigration crisis head-on.South Africa does not need endless extensions. We need decisive leadership, firm timelines, and an unwavering commitment to the rule of law, Ngobeni said.She said while ActionSA supports a humane and orderly approach to immigration, the ongoing pattern of temporary measures has eroded public confidence, undermined border integrity, and perpetuated inequality between citizens and foreign nationals.Ngobeni said the ministers justification that consultations with the Immigration Advisory Board were still ongoing offers no comfort to South Africans who have waited years for decisive action.There is still no clear, time-bound plan to resolve this long-standing issue, leaving our borders porous and our immigration system in disarray, she said.ActionSA has called on Schreiber to publish a comprehensive transition plan with firm deadlines for the conclusion of consultations and implementation of immigration reforms. The party also urged the strengthening of the Border Management Authority and improved internal enforcement to curb illegal immigration.Ngobeni said every further delay deepens social tensions, weakens accountability, and tells law-abiding South Africans that their government lacks the political courage to lead.On Thursday, IOL reported that the Helen Suzman Foundation welcomed the extension of both the Zimbabwean and Lesotho Exemption Permits, saying it would prevent potential humanitarian harm and allow time for a more sustainable policy framework to be developed.According to the Foundation, the extension will allow current ZEP and LEP holders to remain lawfully in South Africa while the minister conducts nationwide consultations. This follows a 2023 Pretoria High Court ruling in which HSF successfully challenged a previous decision to terminate the ZEP programme without prior notice or public consultation.The ministers directive clarifies that ZEP and LEP holders cannot be arrested, detained, or deported under section 34 of the Immigration Act due to an invalid exemption certificate. Holders may also freely enter or depart South Africa under immigration regulations and will not need to produce a valid exemption certificate when applying for another visa category under section 10(2) of the Act.\n\nIn a statement, ActionSA parliamentary chief whip Lerato Ngobeni MP said the extension showed the governments unwillingness to confront South Africas immigration crisis head-on.\n\nSouth Africa does not need endless extensions.

But talk to them today. Talk to the business people today.They will tell you that for the first time theyve kept the ZWG for no less than three months because theyve seen its stability. We have a responsibility as a government to stabilise the ZWG, he said.\n\nHe said once it is stable, those concerns will go as he insisted that business will never be competitive as long as the economy remains stuck with the US dollar.\n\nSo, when we talk about this gradual move, we have them in mind. Its not a reckless move. We know that Zimbabwe has a small population of 16 million which is too small. There is a whole 400 million in SADC (Southern African Development Community), there is COMESA (Common Markets for Eastern nd Southern Africa), there is African Continental Free Trade Area with 1.3 billion people. For us to be able to target those, we have to use our own currency. Thats what we are targeting, he said.\n\nNdlovu added that the migration will be undertaken with due considerations and safeguards as he insisted the country cannot do away with de-dollarisation.\n\n",
