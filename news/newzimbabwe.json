Life can feel overwhelming, and the influence of evil spirits and the devil seems to loom larger as we stray from our spiritual foundations.Yet, in the midst of this turmoil, we are reminded of the powerful promise found in Jeremiah 29:13: You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.This verse encapsulates the essence of pursuing a relationship with Jesus Christ, the ultimate source of hope and strength.The story of Zacchaeus in Luke 19:1-10 serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of our efforts to seek Christ. Zacchaeus, a tax collector, was determined to see Jesus, even climbing a sycamore tree to catch a glimpse of Him.Interestingly, despite his efforts, it was not Zacchaeus who found Jesus first; rather, Jesus saw him. This teaches us that even our smallest attempts to seek Christ matter.When Jesus called out to Zacchaeus, saying, Hurry and come down! For I must stay at your house today, He demonstrated that He is always ready to respond to our desires for connection. Jesus sees us before we see Him, and He invites us into a relationship that transforms our lives.Jesus invites us to try me and see if I dont find favour in you. This call to test His goodness is echoed in Malachi 3:10, where we are encouraged to bring our whole selves to Him.When we seek the face of Christ, we open ourselves to the possibility of His grace and favour, enabling us to confront our challenges with renewed strength.As we invite Christ into our lives, He establishes a permanent relationship with us. This relationship empowers us to conquer our difficulties and stand firm against the adversities we face.When we put our minds and faith in Christ, we are reminded that we are not alone. He walks with us, guiding and supporting us through every trial.The call to seek the word of the cross is a call to embrace a relationship with Jesus Christ. Like Zacchaeus, let us not be discouraged by our limitations but instead be encouraged by the knowledge that every effort we make to seek Him is met with His love and grace.As we draw closer to Him, we prepare ourselves to be called children of God when He returns. Let us seek the face of Christ, for in doing so, we find our true strength and purpose.PRAYERHeavenly Father,We come before You with humble hearts, seeking Your presence and the transformative power of the cross. Thank You for the gift of Your Son, Jesus Christ, who invites us to draw near to Him. We acknowledge that in the midst of our challenges, it is easy to lose sight of You, but we desire to seek Your face with all our hearts.Lord, just as Zacchaeus climbed the sycamore tree in his pursuit of You, grant us the courage to climb beyond our fears and doubts. Help us to reach for You, knowing that even our smallest efforts are seen by You. We trust that You are always looking out for us and that Your love is eager to embrace us.As we navigate the trials of life, may we find strength in Your Word and comfort in Your promises. Teach us to rely on You, and let our faith be unwavering. Help us to recognize the influence of darkness around us and empower us to stand firm in Your light.Lord, we ask that You come into our homes and hearts, establishing a deep and lasting relationship with us. May our lives reflect Your love and grace, and may we be filled with the hope of being called Your children when You return. Remove all the tribulations and pains we find ourselves in today. Restore peace and make us rejoin all our families in love and harmony once again.In Jesus name, we pray.AMEN.\n\nIn todays world, filled with challenges and uncertainties, the call to seek the face of Christ has never been more urgent.

            "content": "By Obert Masaraure\n\nOpen Letter to His Excellency President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa\n\nYour Excellency,\n\nOur nations political history offers costly lessons that cannot be ignored.\n\nThe turning point of Zimbabwes 2017 military intervention, which brought your leadership to the fore, was not only a reaction to governance failure but the culmination of unresolved intra-party succession politics in ZANU PF.\n\nFormer leader Robert Mugabes reluctance to name a successor or allow the selection of one, no doubt, fostered deep-rooted factionalism, empowered opportunistic individuals and destabilised not only the ruling party but the nation.\n\nDuring that period, the unconventional rise of former First Lady Grace Mugabe, with a limited understanding of the partys ideological ethos but with direct presidential favour, no doubt unsettled party structures and alienated key constituencies.\n\nThis treacherous period also demonstrated how closely ZANU PF and the government are intertwined, to the point where internal party manoeuvres have a direct impact on public administration and national policy.\n\nIt became increasingly difficult to distinguish between national governance and party interests, often to the detriment of the common people.\n\nHer ascent mirrored the widening gap between leadership decisions and the realities faced by teachers, civil servants, the formal sector, vendors and the rest of the informal sector, whose incomes eroded while elite political battles consumed national focus.\n\nThis tragic and excruciating economic cost was borne by ordinary Zimbabweans, who endured both the repercussions and consequences of the factional conflict.\n\nToday, Your Excellency, there are troubling echoes of that same toxic environment that spiralled into the military assistance coup.\n\nYour Excellency, the same reluctance you inherited from Mugabe not to publicly outline a clear succession plan is fostering similar factional tensions that resemble events that led to your predecessors demise and the November 2017 coup.\n\nThe growing political profile of businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei, who is a sanctioned figure whose wealth and proximity to power resemble the patronage model that propelled Grace Mugabe, risks creating a perception of leadership capture by private interests.\n\nThis uncertainty is already manifesting in open contradictions among senior party officials, such as ZANU PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa and the partys legal secretary Patrick Chinamasa.\n\nOne of your loyalists, Daniel Garwe, who is the current minister of local government and doubles as ZANU PF Mashonaland East provincial chairperson, recently made a public declaration about no elections in 2028, and strategic manoeuvres to shape ZANU PFs 2027 Congress.\n\nIf such utterances are left unchecked, these developments could fracture the ruling party, which is conflated with our government, in ways that compromise national stability and economic governance.\n\nFor the ordinary citizen, that would again mean delayed salary adjustments for teachers, inconsistent allowances for civil servants, and a widening poverty gap for informal traders who rely on a predictable economic environment.\n\nYour Excellency, your ascendancy to the presidency began with a promise to break from the mistakes of the past.\n\nOn November 22, 2017 when you returned from exile, you issued a powerful and convincing speech where you stated: We want to grow our economy, we want peace, we want jobs, jobs, jobs, to a cheering crowd in Harare.\n\nThis speech served as the backbone of the transformative mantra you envisaged: Zimbabwe is Open for Business.\n\nYet, on succession, the path once again nostalgically appears familiar.\n\nBoth the party and the country require certainty.\n\nZANU PF would be strengthened, the markets would be reassured, and millions of peoples livelihoods would be safeguarded by facilitating the transparent election of a successor at your ZANU PF Congress.\n\nBeing a leader involves more than just retaining power; it also involves facilitating its peaceful transition.\n\nThe alternative is to repeat history at the same human cost that 2017 so painfully taught us.\n\nMr President, maybe its now too late for you to manage the succession. The factions may have lost faith in you. Look across the Limpopo and copy Ramaphosas national dialogue model. That way you broaden the discussion of Zimbabwes future.\n\nYou have an opportunity to rescue your legacy by allowing Citizens to dialogue on the direction they want Zimbabwe to take post your leadership.\n\nDedicate the last 2 years of your term to instituting the reforms that the people so much desire. It is apparent that ZANU PF alone wont allow you to institute the reforms desired by the nation. Rope in a Transitional Council to spearhead the transition agenda within your government.\n\nAt the end of the day, we owe you nothing as a nation. We have allowed you to govern us; we are simply giving you an opportunity to rescue your legacy and protect the interests of your family and allies.\n\nYour Excellency, be warned that if you choose to be indecisive on the succession process, the disenfranchised majority may be forced to take initiatives.\n\nOrdinary people will not allow the replication of 2017, where elites consolidated a system that manufactures poverty for the many.\n\nWe are ready to support a transition towards inclusive governance, but we also stand ready to block the consolidation of elite tyranny.\n\nOn behalf of the disenfranchised masses of Zimbabwe.\n\nObert Masaraure is a unionist and human rights defender. He writes here in his own capacity.\n\n",
