This development follows EJWPs submission of an urgent petition on 14 March 2025, calling for the renewal of the policy, which had lapsed in 2021  a gap that threatened to reverse hard-earned gains in gender equity, she said.\n\nThe CSO described the new policy as a foundation for a more inclusive, equitable and gender-responsive Zimbabwe, with clearly defined strategies to address systemic barriers across legal, economic, health, education, climate, and digital spheres.\n\nThe new policy, EJWP said, marks a shift from aspiration to action  offering a renewed national mandate to address entrenched gender disparities.\n\nAs EJWP, we remain deeply committed to supporting the full implementation of this policy, particularly around inclusive economic empowerment and accountability in public resource management. We will continue to monitor progress, engage with duty bearers, and amplify the voices of women, especially those in marginalised and economically excluded communities, added Mutsamvi.\n\n",

            "content": "Tobacco Reporter\n\nTwo weeks after topping 300 million kilograms of tobacco output for the first time, Zimbabwean officials say this years crop should top 330 million kg, and that achieving 400 million kg in the future is within reach. According to the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board, on June 27, the harvest reached 319.2 million kg.\n\nDriving the surge is a sharp increase in smallholder participation, government-led reforms, and research-driven innovations. More than 127,000 farmers, 85% of them smallholders, are registered this season, which ensures access to inputs, training, and markets.\n\nDr. Frank Magama, CEO of Kutsaga, Zimbabwes leading tobacco research institute, credited the Tobacco Value Chain Transformation Plan introduced in 2021 for boosting productivity through better farming practices, climate-smart seed varieties, and sustainability initiatives.\n\nOver 80% of our crop was produced under contract, ensuring inputs, technical support, and guaranteed markets, Magama said. While expansion has occurred, what is more exciting is the productivity increase per unit area. With improved post-harvest handling, energy-efficient barns, and better training, the numbers are speaking for themselves.\n\nHe also warned, however, of the risks from global oversupply and stressed the importance of environmental compliance to maintain competitiveness.\n\n",
