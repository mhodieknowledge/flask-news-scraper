            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nOUTSPOKEN former independent Norton legislator, Temba Mliswa has challenged erstwhile anti-corruption crusader Vice President (Retired) General Constantino Chiwenga to deal with the rogue behaviour of some Chinese nationals.\n\nMliswa, who recently waxed lyrical in support of President Emmerson Mnangagwa whose bid to extend his term to 2030 has widened the cracks within the Zanu PF party, made the surprise call to Chiwenga seemingly endorsing his leadership style.Chiwenga, who has been on a crusade against corruption, at times describing it as a national security threat, recently tabled a dossier at the Zanu PF Politburo meeting in which Mnangagwa loyalists like Kudakwashe Tagwirei and Wicknell Chivhayo were mentioned.Temba MliswaMliswa believes Chiwenga is using corruption as an trump card, aiming to succeed his principal in 2028, hence his somewhat sarcastic plea for the latter to deal with the Chinese if he is serious about tackling graft.In particular, a Chinese investor, Shuntai Investments Private Limited, is in a spot of bother with a private school, Bryden Country School in Chegutu, over construction of a cement plant near the elite learning institution. The school has raised health fears given the factorys proximity to it. There are suspicions the investor is bribing authorities to evade sanctions.Despite a High Court order halting the work, the Shuntai Investments is still going on with works, thereby giving credence to rumours that money could be exchanging hands or the investor has protection from political bigwigs.Mnangagwas spokesman, George Charamba, recently said there is nothing untoward with the Chinese building a firm close to the school.Mliswa, who is a former Zanu PF Mashonaland West Chairman, hopes Chiwenga intervenes in the standoff between Bryden Country School and the Chinese investor to display his genuineness to fight against corruption and is not just targeting Mnangagwas close allies.Hon VP can you assist on this problem with Bryden. I also have a child there. The Chinese cant be preferred over us & our good education. As a leading light against corruption can you kindly deal with this Chinese issue which has been ignored as they are protected from high up, Mliswa posted on X (formerly Twitter) on Sunday.Mliswa further highlighted the less-than-ideal behaviour of the Chinese in Hurungwe, where they are ignoring a court order and continuing operations in the area, with locals on the verge of being displaced.I also have a Chinese problem in Rengwe with our 25-year lease under threat as a cartel in Gvt (government) wants to displace us & bring some Chinese. They are doing this despite a court order blocking that. I would appreciate your intervention very much. Fighting corruption starts now.Rengwe Conservancy is a wildlife conservation and tourism area in Zimbabwe located across the Hurungwe, Gokwe North, and Nyaminyami districts.Mliswa has stated that whilst he supports Chiwengas fight against corruption, the former army boss should not use the issue to score political points against rivals.I fully support VP Chiwengas rallying call but the fight against corruption should not be weaponised as a political gadget against rivals. That wont produce results with national benefits but rather advance the agenda of a few, he posted on X recently.Of late, Mliswa has drawn himself into the ruling party succession battle and is not hiding his support for Mnangagwa.\n\nMliswa, who recently waxed lyrical in support of President Emmerson Mnangagwa whose bid to extend his term to 2030 has widened the cracks within the Zanu PF party, made the surprise call to Chiwenga seemingly endorsing his leadership style.\n\nChiwenga, who has been on a crusade against corruption, at times describing it as a national security threat, recently tabled a dossier at the Zanu PF Politburo meeting in which Mnangagwa loyalists like Kudakwashe Tagwirei and Wicknell Chivhayo were mentioned.Temba MliswaMliswa believes Chiwenga is using corruption as an trump card, aiming to succeed his principal in 2028, hence his somewhat sarcastic plea for the latter to deal with the Chinese if he is serious about tackling graft.In particular, a Chinese investor, Shuntai Investments Private Limited, is in a spot of bother with a private school, Bryden Country School in Chegutu, over construction of a cement plant near the elite learning institution.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has dismissed an application by Harare lawyer Emmanuel Mukwewa to rescind a default judgment ordering him and businessman Richard Paswa to jointly repay US$176,000 to Chinese investor Huang Li Qiang over a botched land deal.\n\nJustice Siyabona Musithu ruled that Mukwewa failed to show good and sufficient cause for setting aside the judgment, finding that his explanation for ignoring summons and his alleged defence were both without merit.The applicant failed to give a reasonable explanation for his failure to enter an appearance to defend, the judge said.The purported defence on the merits bears no prospects of success.The dispute arose in September 2023 when Huang entered into what was called an Agreement of Consultancy of Immovable Property drafted by Mukwewa. Under the deal, Paswa was to sell Huang a 20,000 square metre stand in Harares Coca Cola area. Huang paid US$170,000 of the purchase price, but the land was never delivered.In July 2024, after neither Paswa nor Mukwewa filed a defence to Huangs lawsuit, the court granted a default judgment, ordering the pair to refund Huang with interest and costs. The investor had accused Mukwewa of colluding with Paswa to defraud him, alleging the stand was non-existent.Mukwewa argued he only learned of the judgment months later and claimed he was not properly served since the summons was left at his old office gate after he had moved. He further insisted he acted only as a legal practitioner drafting the agreement, not as a party to the transaction.But Musithu rejected this, saying service by affixing was proper under the rules and that Mukwewas conduct in drafting and facilitating the deal went beyond mere legal drafting.The way the applicant handled the transaction, as well as the movement of the funds, was all shrouded in secrecy. It bears all the hallmarks of a fraudulent transaction, and regrettably, with the applicant as the main facilitator, the court ruled.The judge noted that Mukwewa styled the contract as a consultancy deal, yet it clearly amounted to a sale of immovable property which never existed.It gave the impression that the property was in existence at the time the applicant prepared the agreement of sale. Yet, as it turns out, the property did not exist,Musithu said.He added that Mukwewas failure to protect his clients interests, including releasing funds without ensuring title transfer, was professionally negligent at best and fraudulent at worst.The apparent lack of care exhibited by the applicant makes him susceptible to a claim of this nature, the judge concluded.Mukwewas application was dismissed with costs, leaving the default judgment against him and Paswa intact.\n\nJustice Siyabona Musithu ruled that Mukwewa failed to show good and sufficient cause for setting aside the judgment, finding that his explanation for ignoring summons and his alleged defence were both without merit.\n\nThe applicant failed to give a reasonable explanation for his failure to enter an appearance to defend, the judge said.The purported defence on the merits bears no prospects of success.The dispute arose in September 2023 when Huang entered into what was called an Agreement of Consultancy of Immovable Property drafted by Mukwewa.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has dismissed a bid by former Zimbabwean diplomat Robert Mabulala to overturn the seizure of his Isuzu KB 280 truck by the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA), ruling that the tax authority acted lawfully in ordering the vehicles re-export to South Africa.\n\nJustice Siyabona Musithu, handing down judgment said Mabulalas challenge was devoid of merit and that ZIMRAs officials simply enforced the law.The respondent would not have been expected to act on the basis of a licence that had been issued in violation of the law, the judge said, adding: Section 3(1) of Statutory Instrument 54/24 is very clear that a vehicle which is imported in violation of that provision has to be re-exported at the importers expense.Mabulala served as a counsellor at Zimbabwes embassy in Pretoria between 2016 and June 2024. When his tour ended, he returned home with two vehicles: a Land Rover Defender and a second-hand Isuzu KB 280 manufactured in 2001.ZIMRA cleared the Defender under the immigrants rebate facility but refused to release the Isuzu, citing Statutory Instrument 54 of 2024, which bans the importation of second-hand vehicles older than ten years. Officials ordered the vehicle re-exported at Mabulalas cost.Mabulala argued that as a returning diplomat, he qualified for exemptions under SI 111 of 2024, which allows diplomats and returning residents to import older vehicles. He further pointed to an import licence issued to him in July 2024 as proof that his Isuzu qualified for clearance.But ZIMRA countered that the law only allows one motor vehicle per returning resident under the rebate scheme. The Defender had already been processed under that facility, meaning the Isuzu did not qualify. The authority also argued that Mabulalas import licence was nugatory because it was issued four months after SI 54/24 had outlawed such licences.Musithu agreed with ZIMRA, stressing that exemptions under SI 111/24 still fall under the one-vehicle limit.The explanatory note made it clear that the exemption applied to used vehicles imported by diplomats granted immigration rebates by ZIMRA the applicant could not claim a rebate of duty in respect of the Isuzu once he had claimed that same rebate in respect of the Defender, the judge said.He also dismissed Mabulalas reliance on the temporary report order that allowed him to move the car inland for clearance, saying it is merely a form of deferred clearance and not a guarantee of approval.Finding no basis to set aside ZIMRAs decision, the court ordered Mabulala to bear the authoritys legal costs.The decision cannot be characterised as grossly unreasonable or irrational, Justice Musithu ruled.
