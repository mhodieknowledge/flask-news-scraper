Authorities say the pronouncements were false, unlawful, and intended to cause psychological harm to foreign nationals and economic damage to Zimbabwe.Later the same day, Mandizvidza allegedly misled Chief Inspector Fidios Chiteure into believing he had been authorised by a senior commissioner to use a Ford Ranger, registration number ZRP 1033R.The vehicle was driven to Waerera village in Bindura, where it was later recovered.On August 14, 2025, the accused allegedly uploaded another video repeating his claim to be the ZRP commander, this time naming Commissioner General Stephen Mutamba  the actual police chief  in what the State says was a deliberate bid to sow disaffection among serving officers.Nyazamba warned the court that if granted bail, Mandizvidza was highly likely to delete the YouTube account he used, thereby destroying crucial evidence.Mandizvidza remains in custody as the court considers the States opposition to bail.He will be back in court on August 18.Vakayi Chikwekwe is presiding over the case while Anesu Chirenje is prosecuting.\n\nHe also faces charges of fraudulently using a police vehicle.\n\nSimbarashe Mandizvidza, 35, a non-commissioned officer stationed at Police General Headquarters Salaries Services Bureau Liaison Office, faces three charges  causing disaffection among the police, procuring the use of a motor vehicle by fraud, and transmitting false data messages intending to cause harm.He was remanded in custody after he told court he needed to get legal representation.In his affidavit, the Investigation Officer Edmore Nyazamba opposed bail, warning that Mandizvidzas release would undermine and jeopardise the objectives and proper functioning of the criminal justice system.The magnitude of the sentence likely to be passed upon conviction will induce him to abscond The sense of peace and security of foreign investors in Zimbabwe will be undermined and prejudiced by release of the accused.The State alleges that on August 13, 2025, Mandizvidza used his Canon 250D camera at his official residence in Hatfield Police Camp to record a video, later uploaded to his YouTube channel Gondo Harishaye, in which he claimed to have taken over command of the Zimbabwe Republic Police and announced that all Chinese nationals residing and doing business in Zimbabwe must leave within 48 hours.He also declared that the ZRP Traffic Section was temporarily disbanded.

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nSmall-scale miners have emerged as the key contributors to Zimbabwes gold production in the first half of 2025, accounting for the majority of the 24.32 tonnes of gold delivered during this period.\n\nAccording to the latest data, Fidelity Gold Refinery (FGR) received a total of 24.31 tonnes of gold, with small-scale and artisanal miners delivering a significant 17.76 tonnes, while large-scale producers contributed 6.55 tonnes.\n\nThis performance highlights the growing importance of small-scale and artisanal mining to Zimbabwes economy. Once banned, artisanal mining has now become a crucial part of the nations economic development, providing livelihoods for thousands and making up a substantial portion of the countrys gold output.\n\nGold production has been on a steady rise throughout the year. Between January and March, a total of 20.10 tonnes were delivered, with small-scale miners contributing 14.56 tonnes, compared to 5.54 tonnes from primary producers.\n\nThe surge in production comes amid strong global demand for gold, which saw the average price per ounce hit a record US$2,862.56 in the first quarter. Experts suggest that these high prices have incentivised miners to increase their output.\n\nThe highest production was recorded in July, when Zimbabwe saw its largest single-month gold intake of 2025. Small-scale miners delivered 3.20 tonnes of the 4.21 tonnes total, while large-scale producers contributed 1.01 tonnes.\n\nInternational gold prices have continued to climb, with spot gold recently surpassing US$3,400 per ounce, peaking at US$3,418.14. This surge has been fueled by softer-than-expected US labour data and growing expectations of policy easing.\n\nAdditionally, global economic uncertainties, such as trade tensions under US President Donald Trumps tariffs, have further solidified golds position as a safe-haven investment, driving up demand and boosting production worldwide.\n\n",

Defendant Priscilla Presley always wanted to the Queen. In fact, despite flaunting a public persona that only wanted to protect and keep her family together, Priscilla ultimately wanted one thing, power, no matter the cost.\n\nPriscilla Presleys attorney Marty Singer disputed the allegations in a two-page statement Thursday.\n\nThis is without a doubt, one of the most shameful, ridiculous, salacious and meritless lawsuits I have seen in my practice, Singer said in a 648-word statement.\n\nThese fabricated claims have absolutely no validity and we are confident this case will be dismissed.\n\nKruse, an auctioneer who specialized in Elvis sales, and Fialko, an Elvis memorabilia collector, said they had been collaborating with Priscilla Presley for years to leverage her name for maximum profits.\n\nBut once Kruse and Fialko got her back on stable financial footing in November 2023, they allege, she abruptly cut ties with them and denied themcompensation from themoviePriscilla.\n\nEarlier that year, the defendants daughter, Lisa Marie, died atage 54.\n\nLisa Marie had been ailing, but Priscilla insisted they attend a Golden Globes event together on Jan. 10 as Priscilla clasped to the spotlight, the lawsuit said.\n\nLisa Marie had collapsed at herhome days earlier and diedofsmall bowel obstruction, the medical examiners office ruled.\n\nPriscilla rushed to West Hills Hospital and despite Lisas clear directive to prolong her life, Priscilla pulled the plug within hours of Lisa being admitted, according to the lawsuit.\n\nPriscilla knew that Lisas death neutralized the threat of Lisas efforts to have Priscilla removed as the sole trustee of Lisas irrevocable life insurance trust and Priscilla ultimately wanted to control the Promenade Trust and Graceland. At her house the week following (before Lisas funeral), Priscilla exclaimed, Im the queen, Im in charge of Graceland. Kruse and Fialko were heartbroken by the unsettling behavior.\n\nSinger, Priscilla Presleys lawyer, said his clients granddaughter Riley Keough stands behind her grandmother 100%.\n\nKeough is equally disgusted with this latest, vicious attempt by Kruse to attempt to ruin her grandmothers life, Singer said.\n\nA rep forKeough, Lisa Maries daughter andPriscillas granddaughter, could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.\n\nElvis and Priscilla Presleywere married for six years and divorced in 1973, four years before Elvis died.\n\nPriscilla Presley is now 80, and Elvis was 42 when he died onAug. 16, 1977, at Graceland.\n\n",
