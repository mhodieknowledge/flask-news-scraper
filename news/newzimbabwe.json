            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nTHE Womens Academy for Leadership and Political Excellence (WALPE) and its partners have engaged Parliamentarians as they lobby for a motion on the Unpaid Care and Domestic Work (UCDW) Bill.\n\nWALPE, together with the Zimbabwe Womens Parliamentary Caucus, developed the motion to ease the burden of unpaid care and domestic work on women and girls through the enactment of a national care policy.Parliament, through Clerk Kennedy Chokuda, has accepted the motion, confirming its readiness for debate and noting that it is in the correct format and will positively impact womens lives in Zimbabwe.According to WALPE, an official date will soon be announced for members to debate the motion in the House.The proposed law calls for the recognition of UCDW as legitimate work and seeks to ensure that womens contributions to the economy are acknowledged and supported.Speaking during a workshop with MPs and Senators in Harare recently, WALPE Executive Director Sitabile Dewa said unpaid care and domestic work falls mainly on womens shoulders, limiting their participation in the paid economy and in society.By recognising unpaid care and domestic work as legitimate work, the Bill acknowledges the valuable contributions women make to their families and communities, she said.Dewa highlighted WALPEs six-year journey of advancing the UCDW agenda, which includes conducting national research, producing academic papers and newspaper opinion pieces, developing knowledge management toolkits, and using testimonials and documentaries to capture the lived experiences of women and girls.During the same workshop, the Zimbabwe Womens Parliamentary Caucus, led by Chairperson Maybe Mbohwa, and supported by male MPs and Senators, urged Parliamentarians to rally behind the Bill once it is introduced in both houses.Over the years, WALPE has also facilitated cross-country learning and advocacy. A leadership learning visit to Kenya brought together stakeholders including the Womens Parliamentary Caucus, the Ministry of Women Affairs, the Zimbabwe Gender Commission, Padare Mens Forum on Gender, Bekezela Home-Based Care and the Mayor of Harare to exchange strategies on UCDW policy reform. The delegation gained valuable lessons from Kenyas development of a National UCDW Policy.In 2024, WALPE presented a Gender-Responsive Public Services Dummy Budget Proposal alongside the national budget process, urging government to invest in public services that recognise, reduce and redistribute unpaid care work.WALPE has also hosted forums with private sector stakeholders, in partnership with Padare, to advocate for collective action in reducing and redistributing UCDW.The lobby groups work has been supported by Oxfam and IDRC/CRDI to ensure communities understand the importance of UCDW policies and their role in achieving gender equality and economic justice.\n\nWALPE, together with the Zimbabwe Womens Parliamentary Caucus, developed the motion to ease the burden of unpaid care and domestic work on women and girls through the enactment of a national care policy.\n\nParliament, through Clerk Kennedy Chokuda, has accepted the motion, confirming its readiness for debate and noting that it is in the correct format and will positively impact womens lives in Zimbabwe.According to WALPE, an official date will soon be announced for members to debate the motion in the House.The proposed law calls for the recognition of UCDW as legitimate work and seeks to ensure that womens contributions to the economy are acknowledged and supported.Speaking during a workshop with MPs and Senators in Harare recently, WALPE Executive Director Sitabile Dewa said unpaid care and domestic work falls mainly on womens shoulders, limiting their participation in the paid economy and in society.By recognising unpaid care and domestic work as legitimate work, the Bill acknowledges the valuable contributions women make to their families and communities, she said.Dewa highlighted WALPEs six-year journey of advancing the UCDW agenda, which includes conducting national research, producing academic papers and newspaper opinion pieces, developing knowledge management toolkits, and using testimonials and documentaries to capture the lived experiences of women and girls.During the same workshop, the Zimbabwe Womens Parliamentary Caucus, led by Chairperson Maybe Mbohwa, and supported by male MPs and Senators, urged Parliamentarians to rally behind the Bill once it is introduced in both houses.Over the years, WALPE has also facilitated cross-country learning and advocacy.

The newly recruited group is tasked with the responsibility to work on the dust road for a monthly payment on very flexible terms.\n\nInformation obtained by our publication from the workers shows that they are allowed to attend to the road after completing their daily household chores and even at comfortable timeframes which they decide on.\n\nSpeaking on the latest developments on the sidelines of the Silveira House organised district impact assessment dialogue, Mberengwa Ward 10 Councillor, Chenjerai Shoko described the companys efforts as tilted towards community uplifting.\n\nSandawana Mine recent move to offer the roads rehab jobs to youths was a noble gesture. The initiative has significantly eased drugs and substance abuses.\n\nThe funds they are earning are also going a long way to fend for their families and shore up the local economic activities as they end up supporting downstream economic activities, he said.\n\nShoko also revealed that just recently, the company supported two awareness campaigns on sexual harassment and Gender Based Violence (GBV), which have gone a long way to eradicate vices whereby boys in the community were chasing after the young girls.\n\nFetty Gumbo, the headman for Mawovere Village, also commended the company for the people centered initiatives.\n\nThe companys pro-people approach continues to spread across the breadth and length of the Midlands Province, serving as a good example of best practices to fellow miners.\n\nThe initiative has gone a long way to revamp infrastructure while empowering the community at the same time, he said.\n\nSandawana is a member of Kuvimba Mining House and is expected to float more jobs and support the community with other initiatives once the internal financial situation improves.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nTHE government has maintained the ban on fishing activities in Lake Chivero due to serious environmental and public health risks posed by the ongoing contamination of the water body, a Cabinet minister has said.\n\nResponding to a written question (question with notice) on the issue by Zanu PF Zvimba East MP Kudakwashe Mananzva last Wednesday, Environment, Climate and Wildlife Minister Evelyn Ndlovu said Cabinet reaffirmed its decision to maintain the fishing ban owing to the significant pollution risks, particularly from untreated industrial effluent and raw soils discharged by surrounding local authorities.Mananzva had asked the minister when the ban on fishing activities in Lake Chivero would be lifted considering that many livelihoods of surrounding communities depended on this activity.I wish to inform this House that Cabinet has reaffirmed its decision to maintain the fishing ban at Lake Chivero. This decision is based on significant pollution risks, particularly from untreated industrial effluent and raw soils discharged by surrounding local authorities.The ban will not be lifted until the root cause of this pollution is comprehensively addressed by the three local authorities around that place, including Norton, Ndlovu said.She added that the government was concerned about public health.We are concerned about public health. While previous assessments by the Health and Child Care minister indicated that fish from the lake may be safe for consumption, Cabinet has taken a holistic view that the ongoing contamination of the lake poses serious environmental and public health risks, said Ndlovu.The safety of fish alone, she further explained, was insufficient grounds to lift the ban because the water was still contaminated.In line with Cabinets directive, my ministry is coordinating a multi-stakeholder response to address the pollution crisis.This includes strengthening regulatory oversight of industrial and municipal discharges, implementing pollution mitigation measures particularly in effluent and sewage management, advancing ecosystem rehabilitation efforts in collaboration with City of Harare, the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) and the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks).According to her, a time-bound action plan was being developed and a joint monitoring framework will be established to track progress and ensure accountability.Ndlovu told the acting Speaker that regular updates will be submitted to the Office of the President and Cabinet (OPC) and if necessary, regular updates would be done in Parliament.We recognise the socio-economic importance of fishing to communities around Lake Chivero.However, any decision to lift the ban must prioritise public health and ecological integrity. We are committed to ensuring that the lake can once again support sustainable livelihoods but only when it is safe to do so, stated Ndlovu.The minister said the government remained resolute in its commitment to resolving the pollution crisis at Lake Chivero.The fishing ban will stay in force until the underlying environmental challenges are effectively addressed.We request the continued patience and cooperation of affected communities as we work towards a cleaner, healthier and more sustainable Lake Chivero which is one of our biggest wetlands.MP Mananzva reminded the temporary Speaker that hunger had no patience.Yes, they are supposed to be patient but hunger is not patient. What plans do you have with these people?Ndlovu said there was need to come up with more projects rather than relying on fishing alone for those affected.However, Dzivarasekwa Citizens Coalition for Change MP Edwin Mushoriwa told the acting Speaker that the ban on fishing at the lake had intensified poaching.Is the Minister aware that the banning of fishing, notwithstanding the reasonable grounds why the government has banned the fishing, is the minister aware that poaching has intensified?Right now, if you go to areas like Kuwadzana, Dzivarasekwa and Norton, people are still eating that fish, courtesy of the poachers, Mushoriwa said.Ndlovu responded, saying her ministry was working with several stakeholders including the Health ministry and fishing cooperatives to alert the public on the dangers of consuming fish from the lake.The law enforcement should be there to protect our people from eating such fish, she said.\n\nResponding to a written question (question with notice) on the issue by Zanu PF Zvimba East MP Kudakwashe Mananzva last Wednesday, Environment, Climate and Wildlife Minister Evelyn Ndlovu said Cabinet reaffirmed its decision to maintain the fishing ban owing to the significant pollution risks, particularly from untreated industrial effluent and raw soils discharged by surrounding local authorities.\n\nMananzva had asked the minister when the ban on fishing activities in Lake Chivero would be lifted considering that many livelihoods of surrounding communities depended on this activity.I wish to inform this House that Cabinet has reaffirmed its decision to maintain the fishing ban at Lake Chivero.

It is primarily funded through a mix of fiscal surpluses, resource earnings, privatisation proceeds, and official foreign currency operations. The fund was renamed via Statutory Instrument 156 of 2023 in line with the countrys broader economic objectives.The recent endorsement by ASIF signals a step forward in enhancing MIFs ability to engage with strategic partners across the continent. The announcement came during ASIFs 2025 meeting, where the organisation welcomed new members, including Ghanas Petroleum Fund. The new additions bring ASIFs total membership to 17 sovereign wealth funds from across Africa.A key highlight from the meeting was the creation of three working groups focused on agricultural development, climate finance, and data infrastructure. These groups are expected to collaborate on impactful projects that align with ASIFs broader mission of supporting Africas sustainable development and wealth transfer to future generations.The ASIF Council will reconvene later in 2025 to review progress and discuss future investment strategies.Launched in June 2022, ASIF started with 10 founding members and has since grown to include 15 sovereign wealth funds. Its aim is to foster cross-border collaboration between African nations to pool resources and expertise, driving larger and more impactful investments for the continents growth.This development highlights a growing trend of African sovereign wealth funds working together to accelerate the continents economic progress, with MIF now joining an influential network of investors.\n\nTHE African Sovereign Investors Forum (ASIF) has officially endorsed the Mutapa Investment Fund (MIF) as its newest member.\n\nThis recognition marks a significant milestone for the Zimbabwean sovereign wealth fund, formerly known as the Sovereign Wealth Fund of Zimbabwe, which was rebranded following the re-election of President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa in 2023.MIF, led by chief executive officer John Mangudya, is a state-owned investment fund established under Zimbabwes Sovereign Wealth Fund Act (Chapter 22:20).

were filmed lying down on their bellies while one of the guards flogged them.Parents and guardians of the school children, who are aged between 13 and 17 years, through the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human

properly for some time.They experienced shock, pain and suffering both physical and psychological, emotional trauma and distress, contumelia and suffered public humiliation while their dignity and bodily integrity was violated.The assault was grievous and psychologically traumatising due to the students young ages and the viral effect of the videos, which circulated on online platforms, the lawyers said.Sigauke and Tavagadza also want the court to order Ngwenya, Dube, Gomondera and Green Fuel to pay a total of US$110 000, which entails payment of US$10 000 to each student, for damages for pain and suffering, shock, trauma, contumelia and violation of dignity.The human rights lawyers are also demanding that Green Fuel publicly apologizes to the learners, their families, and the Chisumbanje community, condemn the guards actions, and commit to preventing similar abuses in future.The legal team also wants Green Fuels apology published in a local Manicaland newspaper, aired
