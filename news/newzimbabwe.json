No officers have been charged.\n\nOn Monday, following the release of the BBC Africa Eye documentary, the IPOA gave an update on the investigations.\n\nThe authority revealed that so far, of the 60 deaths under investigation, 41 involved gunshot wounds.\n\nThe IPOA said it had completed 22 investigations, while it was actively pursuing 36, and that two cases were currently before the courts.\n\nThe investigating agency said it had recorded 233 injury cases during the demonstrations.\n\nIn a statement, the main opposition coalition said the execution of peaceful protesters was premeditated and sanctioned at the highest levels.\n\nMr Mwaura said the documentary risked inciting Kenyans to violence while one legislator called for the BBC to be banned in Kenya.\n\nGeorge Peter Kaluma, said that the 37-minute-long documentary risked destabilising the country.\n\nBut a senator, Edwin Sifuna, defended the documentary saying there were no fabrications in it.\n\nWe must encourage these stories to be told from all angles for the sake of truth and justice. Those who are uncomfortable with this are wrestling with their own consciences and we cannot help them with that, Sifuna posted on X.\n\n",

This recovery is expected to have downstream benefits for the other sectors in the economy. In addition, a stable exchange rate, low inflation, as well as favourable international commodity prices for key minerals are expected to provide a conducive environment for doing business, he said.\n\nThe Groups turnover for the year was US$231.6 million, which is 11% below the previous year. Despite slightly improved demand in the second half, Turnall experienced unavailability of foreign currency for the importation of raw materials, high power outages and fuel shortages.\n\nTurnall intends to implement technical cooperation initiatives aimed at improving product quality and productivity. Export turnover improved to $10.5 million, contributing 5% of turnover from 1.2% in the previous year. This was attributed to the Groups export strategy that resulted in enhanced presence in the regional markets.\n\n",

It is illegal because Nyikavanhu Housing Cooperatives offer letter for the same land was never withdrawn, read the summons.\n\nAccording to the court documents, PPC Zimbabwe presented an offer letter dated February 9, 2024, after being indicted to ensure it removed billboards that had been erected along the property boundary, purporting they owned it.\n\nA Deed of Transfer (No: 6168/2024) from the Sheriff of the High Court, dated March this year, was later presented by PPC Zimbabwe during proceedings.\n\nBecause PPC Zimbabwe kept on manufacturing documents during the court application, it changed the complexion of the matter. Nyikavanhu Housing Cooperative abandoned the application and will apply for the quashing of proceedings as they had become meaningless.\n\nIt is clear that this was a calculated and well-coordinated plan to take over land which had already been allocated to the Nyikavanhu Housing Cooperative.\n\nThe last holder of the title, which was cancelled when the land was gazetted for compulsory acquisition, was Portland. It was earmarked for the expansion of the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport, with an extra runway having been set for construction.\n\nBecause the land had been earmarked for airport expansion, the government had given the Civil Aviation Authority of Zimbabwe (CAAZ) power to weigh in such cases.\n\nNyikavanhu Housing Cooperative has in its possession a 2011 letter from CAAZ authorising its application to subdivide the remainder of Arlington Estate into residential stands.\n\nPlease be advised that CAAZ cleared your application and the development should be carried out according to the requirements listed by the Harare City Council Combination Master Plan, reads the letter dated October 26, 2011 and signed by a P.T Dohwe.\n\nAnother letter of support from the Local Government Ministry, dated November 30, 2010, indicates that Nyikavanhu Housing Cooperative owns the land in question and acknowledges it.\n\nThis letter serves to confirm that Nyikavanhu Housing Cooperative is known and recognised by the office of the Governor and Resident Minister and that it is based at Arlington Estate Subdivision E, reads the letter signed by then Acting District Administrator Godfrey Maeresa.\n\nSimilar letters, shown to NewZimbabwe.com, have raised a stink and added weight to Nyikavanhu Housing Cooperatives allegations that Garwe might have illegally parcelled out the land to PPC Zimbabwe, dragging Mnangagwa into the messy affair.\n\nAfter Mnangagwas presentation of the land, it was lauded as his sign of commitment to promoting industrialisation, supporting the private sector and attainment of Vision 2030 that seeks to have transformed Zimbabwe into an Upper-Middle Income economy by then.\n\nMnangagwa was presented with 60 tonnes of cement by PPC Zimbabwe at the handover.\n\n",

We discussed how this will help not only respect culture, tradition and history but also boost Bulawayos tourist potential.\n\nIt was my great honour today to host Inkosi u Bulelani Lobengula Khumalo for a courtesy meeting at@CityofBulawayoCity Hall.\n\nIn a highly productive and fruitful meeting we discussed how our City can honour the proud history of King Mzilikazi and his descendants throughpic.twitter.com/Qnw0x3JXhA\n\n David Coltart (@DavidColtart)April 21, 2025\n\nGovernment does not recognise the Ndebele monarch, who was installed King on September 28, 2018 by traditional leaders and members of the Khumalo family but recognises Ndebele chiefs, most of whom have been enjoying benefits from the state.\n\nDespite contestation over the rightful heir to the Ndebele crown, King Bulelani has widely been accepted as the Ndebele King against another one of King Lobengulas heirs, Peter Zwide Khumalo who also claims the throne.\n\nThe Ministry of Local Government and Public Works has learnt with shock and utter disgust of a meeting you reportedly held in your capacity as the Mayor of City of Bulawayo with a pseudo King Bulelani allegedly at your invitation and bidding, read the letter, doing rounds on social media.\n\nIt has been brought to my attention that this unlawful and wrongful meeting was held in the Bulawayo Mayors Parlour on 21 April 2025 whereat a pseudo character known as Bulelani was addressed as King Bulelani at your own behest.\n\nAs you may be aware, the Government of Zimbabwe has over the years incessantly denounced and dissociated itself from a self-proclaimed King Bulelani who illegally claims to be the legitimate heir to the now defunct throne of King Lobengula.\n\nThe Ministry would like to advise you, as the Mayor the City of Bulawayo and any other functionary of City of Bulawayo to desist from entertaining this charlatan self-styled King Bulelani as such behaviour is not only criminal but has the negative effect of misleading the general public.\n\n",
