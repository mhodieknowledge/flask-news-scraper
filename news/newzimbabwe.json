            "content": "By Xinhua\n\nTHE upcoming China International Import Expo (CIIE) offers a gateway for Zimbabwean horticultural products to enter the Chinese market, enabling local businesses to directly connect with Chinese buyers and partners, a Zimbabwean exporter has said.\n\nIn a recent interview with Xinhua, Tatenda Mukazi, marketing director of Procitru Investments, a Zimbabwean private company that contracts the growing of fresh produce and other horticultural crops mainly for export, said the CIIE is expected to open new avenues and unlock more growth opportunities for Zimbabwean exports to China.The expo will be held in Shanghai from November 5 to 10. According to Chinas Ministry of Commerce, this years event will feature an expanded special zone for African products, with the number of participating African enterprises increasing by 80 percent year on year.We are going to exhibit blueberries, avocados, avocado oil and macadamia nuts, said Mukazi, who will attend the CIIE for the first time.Zimbabwes blueberries are set to enter the Chinese market following the signing of an export deal during Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwas visit to China in September. A trade protocol on Zimbabwean avocado exports was also signed last September, a move that has excited local farmers eager to access the Chinese market.For this trip, we are going to look for markets, meet buyers and explore machines that can process blueberries into juice for export. We are also looking for partners to do business with, Mukazi said.The expo will also allow him to better understand Chinese market dynamics and systems.I am going to visit their supermarkets and facilities to see how they operate, how they run their systems, and their payment methods, so that we move on the same page, he added.One of Mukazis key goals is to secure direct export agreements with Chinese businesses.I am aiming to meet real buyers so that we can cut off all the middlemen. This is why I am pushing for this trip to be successful, he said.With years of experience in exporting fresh produce, Mukazi works closely with Zimbabwean farmers to identify markets and facilitate exports. He said that the Chinese market represents a significant opportunity for local exporters and that the CIIE serves as a vital bridge connecting Zimbabwean farmers with one of the worlds largest consumer markets.The expo, he added, allows Zimbabwean exporters to showcase a broader range of products beyond the countrys traditional exports such as minerals.Now we are venturing into horticulture, citrus, avocados and berries. For us, it is a great opportunity. We need to show the Chinese market that we are not only buyers; we also have value to offer back home. We can be customers to them, and they can be customers to us, said Mukazi.For us, it is a challenge. We need to up our game and be ready for big deals. It is a new adventure, a new market, and great exposure for us, he added.Beyond opening new export markets, Mukazi sees the CIIE as a platform to deepen partnerships with Chinese companies. As trade with China expands, he said, there is a growing need to work with Chinese partners to increase value addition for local produce such as avocados and blueberries.Already, we have local companies processing avocado oil. On this trip, we are going to bring some samples to market and see how the Chinese market responds, Mukazi said.\n\nIn a recent interview with Xinhua, Tatenda Mukazi, marketing director of Procitru Investments, a Zimbabwean private company that contracts the growing of fresh produce and other horticultural crops mainly for export, said the CIIE is expected to open new avenues and unlock more growth opportunities for Zimbabwean exports to China.\n\nThe expo will be held in Shanghai from November 5 to 10.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe University of Zimbabwes Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences has concluded the medical study of the late Rosalie Chigariro, who in 2021 became the first-ever black Zimbabwean to volunteer her remains for medical research.\n\nHer body was in July 2021 donated to the Department of Biomedical Sciences (Anatomy Unit) for the advancement of medical education, as had always been her wish.\n\nOver the weekend, in a ceremony marked by quiet dignity and gratitude, members of the Anatomy Unit, students, and family members gathered to pay tribute to Chigariro, whose selfless act contributed to the training of hundreds of medical students over four years.\n\nHer generosity gave future doctors invaluable hands-on understanding of the human body, lessons no textbook could ever replace.\n\nIn addition to medical students, paramedics degree programs also benefited from her extraordinary gift. These programs include nursing, physiotherapy, occupational therapy, audiology, speech therapy, and pharmacy, whose students gained essential anatomical knowledge through her donation,\n\nSpeaking at the ceremony, chairperson of the Department of Biomedical Sciences at UZ, Josephine Chidaushe, expressed the universitys deep appreciation for the rare and noble contribution.\n\nThe gift of body donation is one of the most profound forms of service to humanity. Through her selflessness, Ms. Chigariro became a silent teacher, one who helped nurture the next generation of doctors, surgeons, and health professionals, she said.\n\nThough uncommon in African culture, Rosalie made this decision thoughtfully and purposefully. Having battled health challenges since birth  when doctors told her parents she would not live beyond a few months  she grew up understanding both the fragility and the miracle of life. Her choice to donate her body was not one of defiance, but of deep gratitude: a final gift to help others live, learn, and heal.\n\nThere was deep symbolism in her final resting place at Chishawasha Mission, the very grounds where she spent her high school years. Surrounded by faith and learning, it was there she first discovered her sense of purpose  and there, she now rests in peace.\n\nHer family expressed pride in her courage and her lifelong devotion to education and humanity.\n\nWe are deeply proud of her strength and the legacy she leaves behind. Today we say goodbye, not in sorrow, but in gratitude, said her sister, Petronilla.\n\nAmong those whose lives were touched by her legacy was Michelle van der Heiden, a Part Five medical student, who expressed gratitude for the opportunity to learn through Ms. Chigariros gift, describing it as a humbling and transformative experience that will forever shape how we serve patients.\n\nBody donations to the University of Zimbabwes Anatomy Unit play a vital role in advancing medical science, bridging the gap between theory and practice.\n\nHer legacy lives on in the knowledge she inspired, the healers she helped shape, and the lives her courage will continue to touch for years to come.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Government of Zimbabwe has consolidated 11 different local authority licences into a single unitary business licence to improve the ease of doing business.\n\nThe reduction in fees is expected to stimulate entrepreneurship, encourage the formalisation of entities and create free funds for investment in growth and job creation.\n\nThe review came in the wake of representations from industry and commerce stakeholders, who raised concern over the multiplicity and steep licences needed to operate businesses lawfully.\n\nThe new policy consolidates 11 different local authority licences into a single, unified shop licence.\n\nThe reprieve, which has been met with optimism from various stakeholders, extends across various sectors, including retail, tourism, food and confectionery, liquor trading and butcheries.\n\nPreviously, a food factory licence alone could set a business back as much as US$2,300. Now, that entire cost, along with 10 others, is swept away into one simple licence, said Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Minister Professor Mthuli Ncube in a statement at the weekend.\n\nBottle stores operating within a licensed retail shop will no longer require a separate licence, while businesses dealing in both wholesale and retail will need only a single permit.\n\nIntegrated factories and retail outlets on the same premises will be covered by one licence, cutting multiple regulatory costs.\n\nFurther, supermarkets are exempted from Zimbabwe Tourism Authority (ZTA) licence requirements, unless they operate in designated tourist jurisdictions.\n\nTo cushion small and medium enterprises (SMEs), the government has directed that councils set a sliding scale for licence fees, with a maximum limit of US$500.\n\nThis measure is designed to ensure that the cost of doing business remains proportionate to the size of the enterprise, providing significant relief to emerging operators.\n\nThese measures are meant to aid in the creation of a conducive economic environment where jobs will be created, productivity improved across all sectors of the economy, achieving high growth rates through improving the ease of doing business, said Ncube.\n\nGovernment remains committed to improving the business environment to encourage domestic and foreign investment in which Zimbabwe can become an upper middle-income society by 2030.\n\nThe retail sector is one of the fastest growing sectors in Zimbabwe, and to further strengthen it, Government has moved to remove the fragmentation of licences, added Ncube.\n\nThe Medical Control Authority of Zimbabwe (MCAZ) has also removed the permit for the sale of veterinary products, as its functions overlap with those of the Department of Veterinary Services.\n\nTourism businesses, including hotels and lodges, have seen their licence fees reduced by 50 percent, also pegged at a maximum US$500.\n\nChange of property use fee has been capped at US$1,000, down from highs of US$3,500 thereby dealing a huge blow to local authorities which were amassing revenue from the transactions.\n\nLiquor licensing has been simplified, with the Liquor Licensing Board compressing all permits into one, regardless of location.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) Financial Services Licence for local businesses has been cut to US$20, down from US$186, while the Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (PRAZ) will now issue a single licence across business categories at a cost of between US$50 and US$120, applicable to all branches of a company.\n\n",
