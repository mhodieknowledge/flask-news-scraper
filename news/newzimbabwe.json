            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com has invited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner atMadzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal)to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans living in the diaspora. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima and compliments of the new season, we want to continue our discussion on Immigration Law, specifically focusing on foreign Visa applications which we understand you can also assist people with. What are the common requirements in Visa applications to foreign destinations from Zimbabwe?\n\nVM: Compliments of the new season.\n\nGenerally, most preferred destinations for Zimbabweans that require visas before entry commonly require the applicants to possess a passport valid for at least 6 months beyond the intended stay. Applicants are naturally required to complete application forms which will list the varying requirements of the country of interest. These requirements commonly include passport-sized photos, proof of financial means, your bank statement or sponsorship letterset ceteraand invitation letters or hotel bookings for tourists.\n\nReporter: What are the common red flags for visa denial in Zimbabwe\n\nVM: The issue of red flags has to be analyzed in totality. Zimbabwe was and to an extent remains under sanctions as some members of its leadership are still under sanctions. I say this intentionally because our visa applications are looked at carefully as a result of this background.\n\nFurther, a lot of our citizens left Zimbabwe to seek greener pastures under different guises in their applications which has a bearing on current and future applications to visa-requiring countries.\n\nThis has to be balanced against the visa officers duty to protect his or her country against undesirables when considering your application.\n\nIt therefore behoves an applicant to be circumspect when drafting applications. You cannot have incomplete applications with missing information, documents or inconsistencies. Your proof of financial means should align with your intended purpose of visit, where it raises suspicion, such visas are generally denied.\n\nIt is important to understand that the visa application is considered as a whole, so your reason for the visit, previous immigration violations and the reasons for such violations, criminal records, inadequate travel insurance, suspicion of intent to overstay, inconsistent travel history and no ties to home country are all considerations which may raise red flags when considering an application.\n\nReporter:You mention criminal records as a potential red flag, is an arrest without conviction in such applications a criminal record and are ex-convicts able to get visa?\n\nVM: Normally the applications require applicants to only state convictions. However, where the application provides for issues to do with fingerprints having been recorded after arrest, then the production of a certificate of acquittal will be useful.\n\nAs regards ex-convicts, visas may still be granted depending on the nature of the conviction and the policies of the destination country.\n\nHowever, it is helpful for applicants to be comprehensive and transparent in disclosing their legal history.\n\nReporter: You also mentioned ties with the home country, how do you prove these ties?\n\nVM: For certain applications, especially tourist visas, you must be able to show and prove that you will be returning to Zimbabwe after the visit. With this in mind, you can include your current employment, professional or economic ties to Zimbabwe, family and social ties, property and financial ties, community and cultural ties and any other ties that you may consider to be relevant for the visa officer considering your application. I always say that being granted on first application is better than on appeal\n\nReporter: The dreaded word, appeal, what steps should I take when appealing a visa denial?\n\nVM: The first and critical step is to understand the reason for the denial.\n\nEmbassies normally provide a detailed written response outlining the grounds for the refusal. Having understood the grounds for denial, if the grounds are capable of remedy, then the appeal has to address the grounds, providing further evidence and explanations as to why the initial application failed to address the issues raised on denial properly.\n\nThis may include gathering and providing further documentation and proof to satisfy the visa officer from his or her previous misgivings.\n\nThe appeal will also have to be submitted within time and if there are prescribed rules on how the appeal should be submitted, those rules will have to be followed to the letter.\n\nAlternatively, it may be more practical to submit a new application instead of pursuing an appeal. The circumstances dictate the best option.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRelated:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

            "content": "By CNN\n\nVENEZUELAS Nicolas Maduro has been sworn in for a third presidential term in what the countrys opposition movement has decried as coup detat, culminating more than five months of dispute over last summers contested election.\n\nThe ceremony took place on Friday in a small room of the National Assembly, a marked difference from previous ceremonies held in the buildings main hall.\n\nMaduro was sworn in by National Assembly leader, Jorge Rodrguez, who placed the presidential sash on him, prompting thunderous applause from those in attendance.\n\nWeve achieved what we knew we would achieve, Maduro said during his first speech after being sworn in.\n\nThe power given to me was not given by a foreign government, a foreign president or a gringo government, Maduro said at the event, which saw Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and Cubas Miguel Diaz-Canel in attendance.\n\nNo one in this world can impose a president in Venezuela.\n\nChina and Russia also sent representatives, with Russias State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin seen arriving late on a state media broadcast after the ceremony began ahead of schedule.\n\nMaduro was proclaimed winner of the countrys presidential election on July 28, by electoral authorities under the tight control of the ruling Socialist Party.\n\nBut Venezuelas opposition has published thousands of voting tallies claiming that their candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, had actually won the vote with 67% against Maduros 30%.\n\nIndependent observers such as the Carter Center and the Colombian Electoral Mission, as well as CNNs own analysis, have found the opposition tallies to be legitimate. And several nations, including the United States, have since recognized Gonzalez as Venezuelas rightful president-elect.\n\nAnd in a speech Friday afternoon, opposition leader Maria Corina Machado remained defiant, accusing Maduros government of trampling on Venezuelas constitution. Going forward, the pressure will increase even more until Maduro understands that this is over, she pledged.\n\nMaduro violates the constitution, also flanked by the dictators of Cuba and Nicaragua, this says it all, she added.\n\nWhite House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby accused Maduro of a complete disregard for democratic norms, describing Fridays swearing-in as an illegitimate inauguration in remarks to reporters.\n\nGonzlez, who has been in exile since September with a bounty on his head by Venezuelan authorities, had pledged to return to Caracas this week in a potential last challenge to Maduros inauguration. But his planned return on Friday was called off due to security concerns, Paraguayan President Santiago Pea told CNNs Isa Soares.\n\nI continue to work on the conditions for my entry into Venezuela and assume, as mandated by the Constitution and ordered by the people, the presidency of the republic and as commander in chief of the national armed forces, Gonzlez said in a statement Friday.\n\nGonzlezs last known location on Friday was the Dominican Republic, where he had recently met with regional leaders.\n\nCriticism and new sanctions\n\nShortly after the inauguration, the US announced an 18-month extension of Temporary Protected Status for eligible Venezuelan nationals, and new rewards for information leading to the arrest of Maduro and his closest officials, including Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello.\n\nThe rewards for Maduro and for Cabello  now amounting to $25 million each  are the maximum rewards allowed under the State Departments narcotics reward program, an official said.\n\nThe US also announced new visa restrictions for Maduro-aligned officials whom the administration says are responsible for undermining Venezuelas electoral process, and individual sanctions on eight Maduro-aligned officials overseeing economic and security agencies in Venezuela, including a state-owned oil company and Maduros transportation minister.\n\nOn a call previewing the announcement, the official told reporters that Maduro stands mostly alone at this juncture, with few friends in the region and the world, noting statements from countries throughout the region and across the globe since July 28th to call on Maduro to respect democratic norms.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Kingdom on Friday sanctioned 15 people associated with Maduro and what it called his contested regime, including leaders from Venezuelas Armed Forces and members of the Supreme Justice Tribunal.\n\nThe European Union also issued sanctions against 15 people affiliated with Maduro, who have been accused of undermining democracy, rule of law or human rights in Venezuela. And Canada sanctioned 14 current and former senior officials who it said engaged in activities that supported human rights violations in the country.\n\nThe G7 also criticized the inauguration, saying it lacked democratic legitimacy. We reject Maduros continued and repressive grasp at power at the expense of the Venezuelan people, a statement from the group read.\n\nA new phase begins today\n\nMaduro did not name any of Venezuelas opposition leaders in his speech, but referred to the movement currently led by Machado and Gonzalez as Guaid 2.0  a reference to Juan Guaid, who in 2019 proclaimed himself interim president of Venezuela and was recognized by 50 countries, including the US.\n\nA Guaid 2.0 talks to the people in the streets, a new Guaid, and comes with the same baggage, we saw it, we saw their plans, we saw them yesterday, Maduro said, apparently referring to an opposition rally attended by Machado on Thursday.\n\nGuaid also condemned the inauguration, writing on X that the president of Venezuela is Edmundo Gonzlez Urrutia.\n\nMaduro only confirms his usurpation and the coup dtat they carried out on July 28, Guaid added. Venezuelan opposition coalition Plataforma de la Unidad Democrtica echoed Guaids remarks, saying, a new phase begins today in this fight for the freedom of Venezuela throughout the national territory and in all sectors that form our nation.\n\nAnd Human Rights Watch Americas director Juanita Goebertus criticized Maduros swearing-in as the culmination of an election that blatantly disregarded the peoples will and consolidates a dictatorship only sustained by brutal repression.\n\nOpposition leader Maria Corina Machado greets supporters during a protest against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro the day before his inauguration for a third term in Caracas, Venezuela, on January 9.\n\nAhead of the inauguration, Venezuela closed its land border and suspended flights to Colombia  a move that Freddie Bernal, the governor of the Venezuelan border state of Tachira, claimed was in reaction to a international conspiracy against Venezuela, in an Instagram post. He did not provide proof for his claim.\n\nThe border closure came just hours after Colombia broke its silence on the issue and announced it would not recognize the results of last summers elections, stating they were not free.\n\nProtests erupted in Caracas and other Venezuelan cities ahead of the inauguration, with Machado emerging from hiding to speak at one event on Thursday.\n\nMachado was later violently intercepted at the event, according to her team, which said that during the period of her kidnapping she was forced to record several videos and was later released. The Venezuelan government has denied detaining Machado.\n\nMachado said that despite attempts to quell dissent, Venezuelans had defeated fear with Thursdays rallies.\n\nYesterday, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans went to the streets with civility, courage and profound love, Machado said in her video message Friday.\n\n",

I think the formal sectors costs are very high at the moment.\n\nThe cost of power, labour and various statutory costs. It is critical that we grow the base. And once we grow the formal base, the tax revenues will grow automatically.\n\nSo, I think it is important at this moment in time to level the playing field, reduce taxes, reduce compliance costs, make compliance easy, so we can grow the formal market for the future of the economy, Ahmed said.\n\nThe company is producing 300 tonnes of wheat products per day and prefers to supply direct to huge retailers, avoiding the middleman in order to avoid counterfeit products on the market.\n\nWe have always been very strong with our big retailers, your Pick and Pay, your OK, your N. Richards and Gain. That has always been our traditional route to markets.\n\nWe enjoy that market because it gives us a good shelf presence, we ensure that the products that we produce actually get to the retailer. It avoids counterfeit products. So, were very pro the formal market,\n\nThe managing director highlighted that the market had shifted forcing most companies to cover every segment of the consumer.\n\nWe are forced to be both in the informal and formal market. Generally, the liquidity in the country is tight.\n\nThe formal retailers are struggling at the moment. I think the informal sector has become very strong. And given the overhead structure thats in the formal sector, they are struggling. And this is translating into cash flow which has an impact in our ability to supply the retailers., added Ahmed.\n\nHowever, he said the milling company, one of the largest in Africa, will not tire but adjust to current business environment.\n\nWe are navigating, we are looking for solutions with them, looking for payment solutions that are flexible.\n\nWe take local currency, we take ZIG, we take US dollars, we take Rand. Were trying to make it as easy as possible for the retailers. From our point of view, it is important that the retail sector survives in the country for the future of the economy, for the benefit of the fiscus, and for the general economic growth, he added.\n\nAhmed projected a high demand for Mega Market products.\n\n If you produce a good quality product and you have availability of product, I think there is demand out there.\n\nSo, were continuing to grow. Were continuing to go at full speed. Were looking at various projects of value addition and beneficiation.\n\nWe are looking at setting up a noodles line. Were looking at cereal lines, pasta lines, and various other projects that are currently in the feasibility stage. Weve all focus on the economy, and we continue to grow as a business.\n\nHigh production costs have led to closure of many companies in Zimbabwe.\n\n",

Some roads, although trafficable, are being used as an excuse to inflate fares.\n\nPAZ is demanding fair bus fares pricing and transparency.\n\nTransport operators must charge fares that reflect the actual distance travelled and the conditions of roads.\n\nOperators should clearly display their fare structures and provide explanations for any price increases.\n\nGoliath said relevant authorities must intervene and regulate fares and ensure that passengers are not exploited.\n\nTogether, we can fight for fair and affordable transportation, said the PAZ president.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nSOUTH African opposition leader, Herman Mashaba has condemned his governments directive to allow children of undocumented foreigners, including Zimbabweans, to attend schools in that country.\n\nFor the 2025 academic year, South Africas Department of Basic Education (DBE) ordered schools to admit all learners, regardless of their documentation status.\n\nAccording to the memo, those set to benefit include students who fail to provide identification for the countrys matric years and undocumented foreign pupils.\n\nA significant portion of these children are Zimbabweans, often trafficked across the border to parents working illegally in South Africa.\n\nMashaba, who leads Action SA, said had he been in authority he would not allow any undocumented individual or learner to benefit from South Africas already strained resources.\n\nHe was speaking on South Africas national broadcaster SABC.\n\nWe live in a country where a huge percentage of our public schools particularly in poor areas are dilapidated, in an environment where we do not have teachers, where our education system is dire, said Mashaba.\n\nHe said governments decision to allow children of undocumented immigrants to learn without proper documentation encourages more unregistered learners from various countries to come for subsidised education.\n\nThis is because South Africa now seems to be a country where you do not need passports or VISAs, they just have to walk through our porous borders. Our sovereignty is not there anymore.\n\nAn unquantifiable number of Zimbabweans work in South Africa illegally.\n\nThey were forced to brave trekking down south, passing through a crocodile-infested Limpopo river, by Zimbabwes continuously worsening economy that has destroyed hopes of finding jobs.\n\nZimbabweans form a unit of foreigners that include Mozambicans, Malawians and Somalis, which has over the past decades fallen victim to xenophobic vigilante groups chasing them out of South Africa. This includes the infamous Dudula militia.\n\nAdded Mashaba: I do not understand the logic behind this. The people who made this decision want to make sure that South Africans are as poor as possible.\n\nWe know our neighbouring countries are dysfunctional as a result of South Africa also not assisting but we are making matters worse.\n\nI am not sure who they are trying to satisfy. If I had my way, there was no way we would allow anyone without documentation in our country.\n\nAllowing them to use services when we cannot afford them for our own people (does not make sense). You even find in some schools children numbering 90 in a class.\n\nThis is not the first time a senior official has questioned the use of public resources by illegal immigrants in the rainbow nation.\n\nIn 2022, a health official, Phophi Ramathuba, was recorded chastising a Zimbabwean woman who had travelled to South Africa for medical attention after being involved in a car accident.\n\nYou are killing my health system, is what Ramathuba told the woman on video.\n\n",

The whereabouts of the new vehicles remained a mystery.\n\nResponding to images of a fleet of parked refuse trucks, Gama admitted the local authority didnt have adequate trucks to collect garbage.\n\nThose are old broken-down trucks, some which will be auctioned to scrap metal dealers while a few will be rehabilitated, said Gama\n\nEfforts by NewZimbabwe.com to seek clarification from Gama regarding the specifics of the truck hires were fruitless by time of publishing.\n\nCharles Sadondo, Mutare acting corporate communications officer, confirmed his organisation provided services for Harare.\n\nWhat we can share at the moment is that we hired out our trucks to the CoH after a request by the central government requesting us to assist them in the clean-up campaign spearheaded by the government, said Sadondo\n\nChegutus town clerk, Jacob Chikuruwo, also confirmed the hiring of a truck during the festive season.\n\nYes, they hired one truck from us during the Christmas period. We didnt charge them; they only gave us fuel. The ministry (Local Government) had directed us to help them, said Chikuruwo.\n\nMurehwa town administrator, Farai Mutambatuwi said Harare hired one of their refuse collection vehicles.\n\nFrom us, it (Harare) hired one truck, said Mutabatuwi.\n\nMayor Jacob Mafume, when contacted, indicated that the council still needs more trucks as it only acquired five trucks last year.\n\nWe bought about five trucks last year, but we need more.\n\nIm not sure if those trucks are hired. There are those that the government helps us with by taking from departments or any city and we then assist with fuel, said Mafume.\n\n",
