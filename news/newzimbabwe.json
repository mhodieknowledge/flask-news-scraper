Her car was given back to her, Masondo said, without elaborating why the police released a car used in committing of an alleged crime.\n\nThe victim came to the police station and stated that she doesnt want to open a criminal case and provided her reasons. Her car was given back to her.\n\nCol Mavela Masondo\n\nNkomos husband, Sandile Nkomo, had opened a case of a missing person with the police on August 2 after his wife did not return home from an all-night prayer service at a church in Newtown.\n\nSandile had told Sowetan that Nkomo was intercepted along the M2 by gun-wielding men before she reached the church. She told her family that the abductors allegedly drove with her from Gauteng to Ladysmith, KZN, and came back with her after they allegedly realised they had taken the wrong person.\n\nNkomos reappearance became a talking point on social media, with some users raising suspicion about her story.\n\nMasondo said the case of a missing person has since been closed.\n\nSowetan contacted Nkomo, who expressed frustration with how the media has been covering the story.\n\nI have noticed how you craft your articles to suit your narrative on this matter. I will be giving all that information to other media houses that will relay it the way I say it. I will not be commenting further on this matter, thanks. People would rather see a #Justice4Mbalenhle post than one where she was released untouched.\n\nNkomo, a beautician by trade, has since removed her social media accounts.\n\n",

            "content": "By Tawanda Mupatsi| DW\n\nZimbabwes capital Harare is facing flooding, heatwaves and declining biodiversity. How does a stone sculpture park help encourage environmental conservation?\n\nIn Harare, Zimbabwes capital, the Chapungu Sculpture Garden offers a unique fusion of art and environmentalconservation. The park is a sanctuary where sculptors carve stone works of art inspired byanimalsand other natural forms. It, in turn is designed to protectnature. Indigenous native species have been planted there to help preserve them. Artist and park manager Nicholas Kadzungura explains that they are threatened bydeforestation. The garden, founded in 1970 and named after the sacred Bateleur Eagle, serves as both a creative hub and a living classroom, where visitors learn aboutZimbabwes rich ecological and cultural heritage.\n\nMany sculptures in the park reflect Zimbabwes environmental challenges. Friend of the Rhino, a piece by the late Joseph Ndandarika, which encourages empathy and the protection ofendangered species. With only around 600 black rhinos left in Zimbabwe, the message is pressing. Marcey Mushore, the parks director, explains how animistic Shona traditions guide conservation efforts. The park also acts as agreen lungfor Hararesurban sprawl. Some 2.4 million people live in its metropolitan area and pollution and disappearing green spaces are a problem.\n\nChapungus artists are committed to sharing ancestral knowledge through sculpture workshops and educational programs. Kadzungura stresses that Zimbabwes traditional stone art is not just decorativeit carries lessons about coexistence with nature. Asclimate changeand urban development threaten the countrys wetlands andbiodiversity, the parks mission is becoming more vital. Chapungu inspires action by blending creativity, tradition, and environmental stewardship.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Labour Court of Zimbabwe has ordered Fidelity Life Assurance and its sister company, Fidelity Funeral Assurance, to pay former employee Nickson Busu a staggering US$271,727.81 in back pay and damages, ending a protracted labour dispute that has spanned more than a decade.\n\nHanding down judgment on 31 July 2025, Justice Makamure ruled that Busu, who was dismissed from employment in July 2013, is entitled to 107 months of unpaid salary, fuel allowances, and 12 months salary as damages in lieu of reinstatement.\n\nWhat this means is that the applicant is entitled to his back pay and benefits.\n\nThese will therefore be granted as prayed.\n\nThe applicant is said to be in his sixties. This appears not to have been disputed by the respondent.\n\nThe chances of him securing alternative employment continue to diminish.\n\nRespondent, on the other hand, simply indicted that the applicant should not get more than 6 months worth of damages. Respondent did not suggest at what rate such damages should be calculated. After assessing the record, including the submissions, it is my considered view that the applicant is entitled to 12 months salary as damages in lieu of reinstatement.\n\nThe applicant is therefore entitled to the following according to his claim, ruled the judge.\n\nBusu, represented by labour lawyer Caleb Mucheche, claimed US$294,396.85 based on a gross monthly salary of US$1,192.00 as reflected in his April 2013 payslip.\n\nFidelity Life had offered damages equivalent to just six months salary, but the court rejected this.\n\nThe case was remitted to the Labour Court for quantification of damages by the Supreme Court under SC597/24, which had earlier confirmed Busus unlawful dismissal and ordered compensation in line with the Labour Act.\n\nBusu argued that he had made reasonable but unsuccessful efforts to secure alternative employment due to age and poor health.\n\nWhile he did not provide specific medical details, the court acknowledged that, at over 60 years old, his chances of re-employment were continuing to diminish.\n\nJustice Makamure cited precedent from Ambali v Bata Shoe Co Ltd 1999(1) ZLR 417 (S), emphasising that although dismissed employees have a duty to mitigate losses by seeking alternative work, employers cannot use that obligation to evade fair compensation.\n\nThe principle that it is the duty of the employer to prove that an employee made efforts to look for employment should not stop a dismissed employee from ensuring that they mitigate their loss, said the judge.\n\nThe breakdown of the court award includes 107 months salary of US$233,348.81, fuel allowance (150 litres/month for 107 months): US$24,075.00 and 12 months salary in lieu of reinstatement: US$14,304.00\n\nThe court ordered Fidelity Life Assurance and Fidelity Funeral Assurance to pay the amount or its equivalent in Zimbabwean dollars using the prevailing official exchange rate on the date of payment.\n\n",
