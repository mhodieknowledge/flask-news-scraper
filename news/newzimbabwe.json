            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said it would like to see the ZiG fully becoming a national currency, as it weighs whether to place Zimbabwe on a staff-monitored program.\n\nThe ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, succeeded the Zimbabwean dollar in April 2024 after multiple crashes. Its the countrys sixth attempt since 2009 to replace the dollar as the southern African nations main transacting currency, but is yet to succeed.\n\nSeveral measures will need to be adopted to boost ZiG usage, including deepening the foreign-exchange market to ensure full price discovery, said Wojciech Maliszewski, the Washington-based lenders mission chief, who is in Zimbabwe to review its request for a new SMP. The nations last program ended abruptly in 2019 after the central bank printed money that fueled the collapse of the local currency.\n\nRight now we see good stability in the official market and we also see a convergence between the parallel and official rate, he told reporters Monday after meeting Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa in the capital, Harare. Ideally, we would like to see an elimination of this gap, we would like to see one exchange rate.\n\nStill, the ZiGs 43% devaluation in September to narrow the gap between the official and unofficial rate and its inconvertibility has led citizens to favor dollars.\n\nThe ZiG traded little changed on Tuesday at 26.96 against the dollar and exchanged hands at 32 to 35 on the parallel market.\n\nThe Washington-based lender said it isnt pushing for more exchange rate depreciation but for the two rates to converge supported by government fiscal discipline.\n\nThere is a good chance that these rates will converge, Maliszewski said.\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncube last month at the annual meetings of the African Development Bank said he expected the SMP to be finalized by the end of June. The program would bring Zimbabwe closer toward revamping its $21 billion debt pile with creditors that want assurances that its authorities are pursuing prudent fiscal and monetary policies.\n\n",

We are forced toimprovise daily just to preserve life. But we cannot continue like this. The systemhas failed, and the suffering is unbearable.\n\nWe call on the government of Zimbabwe to urgently prioritise the health sector.Equip hospitals. Support nurses. Save lives. This situation must be addressedwithout delay, Dongo said.\n\nDongo also said public hospitals do not have blankets for patients in this winter season andsome wards do not have windows.\n\nFacilities are deteriorating fast. There are no blankets in many wards as weapproach winter. Some hospitals do not even have proper windows.\n\nX-ray departments are not functioning. Diagnostic centres are almost non-existent.Basic lab services are unavailable.\n\nNurses are unable to conduct essential tests, and the sick are being referred to private hospitals that they cannot afford. They remain in public wards, in pain, waiting, suffering, Dongo added.\n\nRecently, Health Minister Douglas Mombeshora admitted that Zimbabwes biggest referral public hospital, Parirenyatwa, is in a bad state after a tour following a public outcry.\n\nThe situation at Parirenyatwa is a reflection of all public hospitals in the country.\n\nOver the years, health workers have submitted numerous petitions and staged protests calling for urgent government intervention; however, the authorities have taken little to no action.\n\n",

Never let them lie to you. Its leader McKenzie is now a minister. He has never proposed legislation on the subject, not even a private members bill as an MP.

Start by telling us, do you even care?\n\nLonzi, however, was unfazed and accused McKenzie of avoiding parliamentary committee meetings. You must stop running away from parliament committee meetings.
