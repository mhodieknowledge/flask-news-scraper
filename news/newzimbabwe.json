            "content": "By Chipo Sabeta\n\nCelebrated gospel artist Mathias Mhere is set to headline the Free to Worship Legacy Concerts in Australia, a series of worship events bringing together believers from around the world for nights of praise, unity, and celebration.\n\nSupported byDiaspora Insurance, the highly anticipated concerts will be held across three major cities next month: Melbourne on November 7, Sydney on November 8, and Perth on November 9, marking one of the most significant international tours for the Free to Worship movement.\n\nFree to Worship began as a small group of passionate singers united by a common mission: to worship God freely. Over the years, the choir, part of ZAOGA Forward in Faith Ministries International (FIFMI),has grown into a globally recognised ensemble of gifted vocalists and musicians who embody the energy, unity, and faith of FIFs vision.\n\nThrough dedication, teamwork, and steadfast partnerships,including long-standing support from Diaspora Insurance,Free to Worship has transformed from humble beginnings into a global phenomenon. The groups mission is to demonstrate that when people are truly free to worship, lives are changed, hearts are healed, and nations are uplifted.\n\nDiaspora Insurance CEO Jeff Madzingo (left), ZAOGA Forward in Faith Australia Bishop Masaka (centre), and Free to Worship Chairman Tawanda Sarireni (right) were recently pictured at the FIFMI Australia Believers Convention, celebrating the enduring partnership between Diaspora Insurance and Free to Worship.\n\nFor over a decade,Diaspora Insurancehas been a faithful partner of the movement, supporting its efforts to spread hope and faith through music.\n\nKnown for their powerful and spirit-filled concerts, Free to Worship events have become landmark gatherings on the FIF calendar, drawing thousands of worshippers across cities and nations. Each concert brings an atmosphere of revival, joy, and community through original music, dynamic praise, and heartfelt worship that transcends cultures and languages.\n\nWe have been praising God from our humble beginnings until now, when we are having sold-out shows, said Chairman Tawanda Sarireni. With Free to Worship concerts selling out and packing arenas over three consecutive years, there has been a longing to see the group live by many overseas fans.\n\nFree to Worship\n\nBeyond the stage, Free to Worship also serves as a training ground for young believers, helping them discover and nurture their God-given musical talents. Many alumni have gone on to inspire others in both local and international ministries, carrying the same anointing and excellence that define the group.\n\nSarireni said the choir continues to unite worship leaders, gospel singers, and instrumentalists from various churches and nations, strengthening the message of unity in faith.\n\nFounded by the late Archbishop Ezekiel Guti, Free to Worship continues to shine as a vessel of praise, reminding believers everywhere that music, faith, and devotion can transform communities and touch nations.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal) to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans living in the diaspora. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. You spoke on sustainable infrastructure development at the CEOAfrica AnnualRoundtable in Victoria Falls. What is your position on sustainable infrastructure development in the African context, considering that Africa is a low global contributor to world pollution?\n\nVM: Thank you\n\nAs a point of correction, I spoke on legal considerations for unlocking finances for sustainable infrastructure development. My focus was really on the different mechanisms available to unlock finance for funding infrastructure projects in Zimbabwe, the continent and around the world.\n\nTo your question, sustainable development is a global reality despite various individual contrary views on whether it is necessary or fair. There is a plethora of legislation and policy entrenched in financing institutions that fund global development projects. They (the financial institutions) have, as a prerequisite, the condition that the projects be conscious of ESGs, being environmental, social impact and governance considerations.\n\nA debate on its necessity, especially as 54 separate African countries, is in my view, an uphill task and the logical thing will be for each to benefit from the funds available and develop the individual countries for the collective benefit\n\nReporter:Lets then start with the continental position. What legal and financial instruments are available for infrastructure development that is sustainable?\n\nVM: We have a number of funds that promote infrastructure development that are premised on sustainability by taking into consideration the environment and social impacts. An example will be Sustainable Energy Fund for Africa (SEFA), Green Climate Fund and even the African Development Bank also prescribes infrastructure projects to establish sustainability.\n\nThis is not just a continental requirement, even when unlocking global international finance, institutions are guided by the Equator Principles and International Finance Corporation performance standards, which have at their core, requirements for the financing institution to satisfy itself that the projects being funded are environmentally sustainable.\n\nIf we were to also look East, being global financial giants, China in 2021 also implemented the Green Development Guidelines for Overseas Investment and Cooperation and is also considering sustainability in its funding mechanisms.\n\nTo the second part of your question on sustainable infrastructure development, on the continent, we are guided by the African Union Agenda 2063 being a blueprint of Africas structural transformation.\n\nFurther, we also have the Programme for Infrastructure Development (PIDA) with a priority action plan or mandate to give preference to cross-border projects in energy, water and transport, among other things. These projects, as you can see at face value, have serious environmental and social considerations.\n\nThen there is the African Free Trade Organisation, which makes sustainable infrastructure a treaty-based obligation. The harmonisation of the continental laws and individual state laws is now a legal and economic necessity.\n\nReporter: Before discussing what the position in Zimbabwe is, what are the things investors generally consider when investing in infrastructure development?\n\nVM: Well like in every investment transaction, the investor is concerned mainly with whether he or she will attain enforceable rights, whether or not there are predictable timelines within the project and key to all, whether the project has taken into consideration and mitigated against any potential environmental and social impact, allowing maximum protection to the potentially affected.\n\nReporter: What is then our Zimbabwe position in terms of sustainable infrastructure development?\n\nVM: I will reiterate what I said at the CEO roundtable conference, my view is that our laws in terms of sustainable infrastructure development are well developed and competitive on the continent.\n\nSustainability is a constitutional, legislative and policy question in Zimbabwe as it is covered by all pillars of the prescriptive and guidance laws in our country.\n\nOur weakness is that the laws are fragmented and found in various statutes that address the different areas where sustainability is a question. Although the Environmental Management Act is the overarching legislation, aligning with the prescriptive terms of our constitution, other legislation like your Water Act, Electricity Act, ZIDA and many other have sustainability considerations.\n\nThe National Development Strategy 2, commencing in 2026, has put sustainable development goals at the core of its policy.\n\nCountries like Kenya have managed to amalgamate these laws into a single reference legislation, making them more attractive to sustainable infrastructure development financing. Although we have a National Climate Policy, our National Climate Management Bill, which will harmonise these laws, is going through the legislative processes with the objective of having a national reference point.\n\nReporter: Would you then advise that ESGs be part of all sustainable infrastructure development plans for investors? If yes, what would your reasons be?\n\nVM: With the risk of sounding like a broken record, international finance can mostly be accessed by companies that can show project environmental and social impacts, including mitigation and remediation options.\n\nIt therefore widens the areas where the developer can access development finance.\n\nInclusion of ESG considerations future proofs projects because most African countries, with Zimbabwe included, are incorporating or perfecting the laws that deal with climate issues.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr Madzima. We have to end here because of our time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

Today, she stands not only as a cancer survivor but also as the Chief Executive Officer of the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee (ZOC), a symbol of resilience, leadership, and hope.\n\nMarlenes journey took a sudden turn in September 2019 when she was diagnosed with stage three colorectal cancer, a diagnosis that would challenge her both physically and emotionally. The road to recovery was far from easy, marked by surgery, 40 sessions of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, uncertainty and moments that tested her strength.\n\nYet, through it all, the 30-year-old accountant remained steadfast and determined, drawing on her faith, her support system, and her deep inner resolve.\n\nMarlene undergoing cancer treatment\n\nBy 2020, Marlene had entered remission, emerging from her treatment with renewed gratitude for life and an unshakable sense of purpose. Now, five years in remission, though not yet officially declared cancer-free, she continues to live with courage and conviction. It is a daily reminder that healing is both a physical and spiritual journey.\n\nChoosing not to keep her story private, Marlene uses her voice to inspire others and advocate for cancer awareness, encouraging early screening, open conversations about health, and emotional support for those facing similar struggles.\n\nMarlene uses her voice to inspire others and advocate for cancer awareness\n\nHer message is simple yet profoundly powerful: Cancer is not the end. With courage, treatment, and support, there is life beyond diagnosis.\n\nProfessionally, Marlene is a force of determination and excellence. She holds a bachelors degree in accountancy (BAcc), a Master of Science in Management and Finance, and an MBA, academic achievements that mirror her commitment to growth, integrity, and leadership. Her career has spanned several significant roles, including with the Footballers Union of Zimbabwe and Education Matters Africa, before taking on her current position as CEO of the Zimbabwe Olympic Committee.\n\nIn her role at ZOC, Marlene continues to lead with vision, empathy, and integrity, championing initiatives that empower athletes and promote inclusivity, sustainability, and good governance in sport. Her leadership is shaped not only by her professional expertise but also by the compassion and resilience honed through her personal journey of survival.\n\nMarlene celebrated her victory over cancer in 2020, a joyful moment that embodies her strength and resilience.\n\nMarlenes story is more than one of professional success. It is a living testament to faith, perseverance, and the unbreakable power of the human spirit.\n\nThrough her life and work, she reminds us of all that even in the face of adversity, strength and purpose can prevail. She reminds us that surviving cancer can mark the beginning of a renewed mission to live boldly and lead with heart.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nLimpopo Premier Dr Phophi Ramathuba has describedthe deadly N1 bus crash that claimed 43 livesas a preventable disaster and an act of criminal negligence, following revelations that the vehicle was overloaded, unroadworthy and speeding when it plunged down a steep embankment near Louis Trichardt last week.\n\nOn Monday, Ramathuba met with the families and relatives of the deceased at Siloam Hospital in the Vhembe District, where she extended her condolences and expressed solidarity with those mourning the loss of their loved ones. Addressing the gathering, she said the tragedy was not an unavoidable act of fate but the result of lawlessness and greed within the cross-border transport industry.\n\nThe victims  mostly Zimbabwean and Malawian nationals  were travelling home when the bus veered off the N1 North near Louis Trichardt on 13 October, killing 43 passengers and injuring 40 others.\n\nAccording to a technical report by the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC), the bus was operating without meeting roadworthiness standards, carried passengers beyond its legal limit and was travelling at an unsafe speed along a mountainous route. Ramathuba said such conditions made the tragedy not just an accident, but a crime against humanity.\n\nThe government will not allow lives to be lost due to greed, lawlessness and disregard for human life, she said. We condemn reckless driving, non-compliance with transport regulations, and the operation of unroadworthy vehicles. The law must take its course, and those responsible must be held accountable.\n\nLimpopo Premier Dr Phophi Ramathuba\n\nRamathuba also commended the emergency services and hospital staff who responded to the scene, saying their swift action saved lives under difficult and dangerous conditions. Our rescue teams risked their own lives to retrieve bodies and transport survivors to safety. Their commitment gave dignity to the deceased and comfort to the grieving, she said.\n\nThe Limpopo government has partnered with the diplomatic missions of Zimbabwe and Malawi to identify and repatriate the deceased. Forensic teams have completed postmortem examinations and begun DNA testing to ensure accurate identification of remains.\n\nFamilies of the victims were provided with counselling and logistical support as they began the painful process of identifying their loved ones.\n\nThe tragedy has reignited concerns over South Africas road safety record and the persistent operation of unsafe, overloaded cross-border buses. Transport experts and activists have long warned that weak enforcement and corruption in vehicle inspections allow dangerous operators to remain on the road, turning long-distance routes into death corridors.\n\nFor many families, the loss goes beyond the immediate grief  it also means the loss of breadwinners who had been working in South Africa to support relatives in neighbouring countries.\n\nEvery life lost on our roads is a blow to a family, a community, and to our shared humanity, Ramathuba said.\n\nAs the province continues to assist with repatriations and investigations, the premier urged all road users to prioritise safety and accountability.\n\nLife has no duplicate, she said.\n\nEvery journey must begin with responsibility. Let us not wait for another disaster to remind us of the value of a single human life.\n\n",
