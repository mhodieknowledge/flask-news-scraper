The newspaper also quoted health experts who warn that using such unsafe accessories is dangerous and ineffective in preventing HIV.According to The Herald, the NAC has confirmed that while there were isolated reports of stockouts and hoarding earlier in the year, the situation is now under control. The council told the Harare-based publication that female condoms are also available in abundance and that their supply exceeds demand.The Herald also confirmed that Zimbabwe has the capacity to test condoms for quality control, with the Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe (MCAZ) possessing specialized equipment to ensure they meet international standards.In 2022, IOL reported that the price of condoms in Zimbabwe was so high, with a three-pack costing about the same price as the minimum wage domestic workers take home.According to local media at the time, sex workers in the country were allegedly having to resort to using bread packets as contraception, as the price of condoms and basic essentials continues to rise.\n\nHowever, a separate report from the international news agency AFP presented a different perspective, highlighting the struggles of sex workers.\n\nAFP quoted a 43-year-old sex worker, Sharon Mukakanhanga, who says she resorted to using baby socks as a condom when she became desperate after the withdrawal of U.S. foreign health aid.Another sex worker, Cecilia Ruzvidzo, was quoted by AFP as saying, I could not get condoms, which are a necessity for my work.The Herald newspaper stated that the claims of using baby socks are greatly exaggerated and misleadingThe Herald stated that the claims of using baby socks are greatly exaggerated and misleading and were sensationalized by anti-government organizations.

Our country Zimbabwe is, indeed, on a reversible journey towards vision 2030.\n\nThis modern infrastructure serves as a source of pride for the veterans of the liberation struggle, who fought so that all our people can have a higher quality of life, he said.\n\nThe project will provide 300 residential flats and 750 student apartments.\n\nThe project also provided over 3 000 job opportunities benefiting members of the Zvishavane community and others.\n\nThe local community also benefitted from upgraded water and sanitary systems as well as improved road networks following the introduction of the project.\n\nWork resumed in March last year and has been completed.\n\nMnangangwa said project is a symbol of national unity and progress, adding his government will continue pushing towards achieving such high-quality projects countrywide.\n\nThis is the standard and work we must uphold across all our entities.The residential flats are investments in the dignity of our people through quality living space.\n\nMnangagwa also said the success of this project demonstrates the power of private public partnerships, further applauding the PSPF and its partners.\n\nFirst Mutual Wealth provided the land, while the majority of the capital, approximately 97%, was invested by the PSPF, with First Mutual acting as project manager, according to Douglas Hoto, chairman and group chief executive officer of First Mutual Holdings.\n\n",

The water has impurities when it is available. When it is left in containers, the water turns greenish and brownish, which reduces confidence among residents to drink it.\n\nObservations by a lot of residents are that the city water dries their skin, probably due to the treatment chemicals they are using, read the report.\n\nThe plight of Harare residents was further compounded by the local authoritys workers, who embarked on a strike, citing incapacitation and protesting the death of two fellow employees who died in Budiriro.\n\nConsequently, the council could not attend to burst pipes, leaving areas like Mufakose as a ticking health time bomb.\n\nThe report further stated that the state of the roads in Harare is dire, leaving residents to patch up the potholes themselves.\n\nThe majority of the roads in Harares high-density residential suburbs are in bad shape, with potholes everywhere. The situation is better in the low-density areas, where the residents sometimes use their personal resources to do road patching, and council workers put more energy into repairing and maintaining roads leading to the homes of the powerful elites in society.\n\nIn Mbare, residents are disgruntled by the poor state of their streets. Vehicles passing by leave a trail of dust filling their homes. This has forced many households to keep their windows and doors closed most of the time. If not closed, sofas and floors will be covered in dust. Due to the dust, residents now fear contracting diseases, the report read.\n\n",
