Authorities say the pronouncements were false, unlawful, and intended to cause psychological harm to foreign nationals and economic damage to Zimbabwe.Later the same day, Mandizvidza allegedly misled Chief Inspector Fidios Chiteure into believing he had been authorised by a senior commissioner to use a Ford Ranger, registration number ZRP 1033R.The vehicle was driven to Waerera village in Bindura, where it was later recovered.On August 14, 2025, the accused allegedly uploaded another video repeating his claim to be the ZRP commander, this time naming Commissioner General Stephen Mutamba  the actual police chief  in what the State says was a deliberate bid to sow disaffection among serving officers.Nyazamba warned the court that if granted bail, Mandizvidza was highly likely to delete the YouTube account he used, thereby destroying crucial evidence.Mandizvidza remains in custody as the court considers the States opposition to bail.He will be back in court on August 18.Vakayi Chikwekwe is presiding over the case while Anesu Chirenje is prosecuting.\n\nHe also faces charges of fraudulently using a police vehicle.\n\nSimbarashe Mandizvidza, 35, a non-commissioned officer stationed at Police General Headquarters Salaries Services Bureau Liaison Office, faces three charges  causing disaffection among the police, procuring the use of a motor vehicle by fraud, and transmitting false data messages intending to cause harm.He was remanded in custody after he told court he needed to get legal representation.In his affidavit, the Investigation Officer Edmore Nyazamba opposed bail, warning that Mandizvidzas release would undermine and jeopardise the objectives and proper functioning of the criminal justice system.The magnitude of the sentence likely to be passed upon conviction will induce him to abscond The sense of peace and security of foreign investors in Zimbabwe will be undermined and prejudiced by release of the accused.The State alleges that on August 13, 2025, Mandizvidza used his Canon 250D camera at his official residence in Hatfield Police Camp to record a video, later uploaded to his YouTube channel Gondo Harishaye, in which he claimed to have taken over command of the Zimbabwe Republic Police and announced that all Chinese nationals residing and doing business in Zimbabwe must leave within 48 hours.He also declared that the ZRP Traffic Section was temporarily disbanded.

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nSmall-scale miners have emerged as the key contributors to Zimbabwes gold production in the first half of 2025, accounting for the majority of the 24.32 tonnes of gold delivered during this period.\n\nAccording to the latest data, Fidelity Gold Refinery (FGR) received a total of 24.31 tonnes of gold, with small-scale and artisanal miners delivering a significant 17.76 tonnes, while large-scale producers contributed 6.55 tonnes.\n\nThis performance highlights the growing importance of small-scale and artisanal mining to Zimbabwes economy. Once banned, artisanal mining has now become a crucial part of the nations economic development, providing livelihoods for thousands and making up a substantial portion of the countrys gold output.\n\nGold production has been on a steady rise throughout the year. Between January and March, a total of 20.10 tonnes were delivered, with small-scale miners contributing 14.56 tonnes, compared to 5.54 tonnes from primary producers.\n\nThe surge in production comes amid strong global demand for gold, which saw the average price per ounce hit a record US$2,862.56 in the first quarter. Experts suggest that these high prices have incentivised miners to increase their output.\n\nThe highest production was recorded in July, when Zimbabwe saw its largest single-month gold intake of 2025. Small-scale miners delivered 3.20 tonnes of the 4.21 tonnes total, while large-scale producers contributed 1.01 tonnes.\n\nInternational gold prices have continued to climb, with spot gold recently surpassing US$3,400 per ounce, peaking at US$3,418.14. This surge has been fueled by softer-than-expected US labour data and growing expectations of policy easing.\n\nAdditionally, global economic uncertainties, such as trade tensions under US President Donald Trumps tariffs, have further solidified golds position as a safe-haven investment, driving up demand and boosting production worldwide.\n\n",
