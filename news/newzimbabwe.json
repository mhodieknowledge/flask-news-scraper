Zimbabwe still lacks policy on compensation for those affected.\n\nEnvironment Minister Evelyn Ndlovu last week told the Senate, through a ministerial statement, that until the Parks and Wildlife Amendment Bill went through Parliament, government was incapacitated to to come up with any programme regarding compensation for victims.Every month, cases of wild animals attacking people are being reported and some have lost lives whilst others got permanent injuries but there have been no policy or law to effect compensation.It is important to note that Zimbabwe currently lacks a formal nationwide policy on compensation, until the Bill goes through Parliament and through the Senate, we are incapacitated to come up with a programme.This compensation fund, is relief for the loss of

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans living in the diaspora. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, this week we want to discuss fractional ownership of property by multiple investors. Is it a viable model, especially for the diaspora community?\n\nVM: Thank you\n\nIf we are to consider the entry costs for acquiring investment properties in some areas of Zimbabwe, especially those investment properties that will give a significant return for the investors, fractional ownership is possibly one of the viable options to consider.\n\nAlthough this model is available for both the local and the diaspora community, in response to your question, I will address the unique circumstances faced by the diaspora community.\n\nIt may be helpful to first explain what fractional ownership is. It is a joint ownership model where a number of investors invest in the construction or purchase of an income-generating property or even a holiday home, each investor literally owning a fraction of the property commensurate to their level of investment.\n\nThe property may be let out for rentals or the investors have time shares, meaning they enjoy exclusive use of the property at allocated times of the year.\n\nExamples of such properties that are usually invested in using this model are commercial centres that will be let out, specialised medical centres or hospitals, resorts, holiday homes or airbnbs which may also have a time share model.\n\nPooled investing allows for cheaper access to ownership as no single investor will be individually burdened with the full cost of development. All attributable risks are shared among the investors with opportunities to share ideas among investors that result in the best outcomes at the lower costs.\n\nIf lucky, in some instances, some of the investors may have specialist skills useful for the project, reducing costs and mitigating potential errors that would have occurred had the project been carried out by an unqualified individual.\n\nReporter:What challenges are commonly faced when the combined investors undertake such projects with such ownership structures?\n\nVM: The common problem is that of limited ownership; the investor is hamstrung from exercising full ownership rights and is bound by the decision of the collective. This really comes down to temperament and individual idiosyncrasies.\n\nSome investors may still want to act as if they have full ownership in situations where they do not.\n\nFurther, in circumstances where the investors are constructing and managing their own properties, the common problem is that the investors may have a different understanding of the project costs and outcomes. Normally, the project proponent, advocate and coordinator may not have fully explained or given provision for unforeseen events to the extent that there are disagreements between the various investors at project inception, implementation and or completion.\n\nLet me use the example of a completed project, a significant portion of the returns have to be reinvested in the property for maintenance and improvement, some investors will not have considered this eventuality.\n\nLastly, challenges are definitely faced where arrangements do not provide for disengagement or disinvestment procedures and processes. Investors will most likely end up resolving their issues in court at a significant cost.\n\nReporter: How best can investors mitigate against these disagreements?\n\nVM: In my view, the best way to mitigate against the common problems that arise as a result of fractional ownership is to ensure that the agreement governing the fractional ownership arrangement is as comprehensive as possible, detailing and providing various options on how the relationship may be dissolved, for example, what steps should an investor take when they intend to liquidate their investment, at what point may an investment be liquidated et cetera.\n\nOther common issues will include how the property is managed, by whom and how the investments are selected etc. Long and short, the preliminary processes have to be comprehensive enough to mitigate against the would be grey areas.\n\nIf the property to be developed or invested in performs a specific function, for example, a dialysis centre and the investors operate in that specific field or have specialist knowledge, then field-specific circumstances must also be addressed in the initial agreement, including mitigating the potential adverse situations.\n\nThe other pressing issue is that some investors may intend to enjoy their dividends in the diaspora, if that is the case, registering their investment with the Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency(ZIDA)will be useful as such registration comes with state backed protection. The investors will be assisted in repatriating some of the dividends and capital.\n\nThe general investor who wants to invest in property fractional ownership is best suited to invest in a REIT.\n\nReporter: Why do you think a REIT is a more appropriate investment model?\n\nVM: In circumstances where the investment property is not for timeshares or other speciliazed use, real estate investment trusts offer a quick in and when required,out option, allowing for investing in high return property.\n\nI say this because such trusts are typically managed by professionals with experience in these fields, who are able to identify high-rental and capital-return properties.\n\nREITs are also governed by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Zimbabwe, which means that companies operating them must satisfy minimum capital requirements and are obligated to make public disclosures and distribute dividends on a mandatory basis.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

            "content": "By Jennifer Cartwright\n\nA LEEDS-based charity has launched a BBC Radio 4 Appeal to help tackle a crisis affecting over 50% of Zimbabwean children: the lack of a birth certificate.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Educational Trust, a charity which was founded in 1987 by Vuli Mkandla, an educator from Zimbabwe who moved to Leeds, work with grassroots organisations in Zimbabwe to deliver education-focused projects for marginalised young people.\n\nTheir appeal, named Exist to Exist  Every Childs Right to Be Seen, aims to shine a light on how families are denied basic rights because of missing paperwork.\n\nAccording to UNICEF, only 49% of births in Zimbabwe are registered.\n\nWithout a birth certificate, people in Zimbabwe can be denied access to basic rights including healthcare and education.\n\nAndrew Jackson, Zimbabwe Educational Trust Operational Manager said: Birth registration is one of the biggest issues of our time within Africa and significantly within Zimbabwe. Around half of the entire population and children under five in Zimbabwe are not registered.\n\nTheres a myriad of reasons why but it is an absolute block to human rights.\n\nDerrik Mkandla, Chair of Trustees at the Zimbabwe Educational Trust also highlighted that without a birth certificate, Zimbabweans cannot access a national ID which means they cannot vote, access legal work, or obtain a passport.\n\nHe said: In Zimbabwe you need a birth certificate to get your national ID. Without your national ID, you effectively dont exist.\n\nThe issue not only affects children. Often, parents of unregistered children in Zimbabwe are also unregistered themselves.\n\nSince 2011, the Zimbabwe Educational Trust has been working with Trinity Project, a grassroots organisation in Zimbabwe, to help people gain legal identification. Together, theyve supported 7,700 children and 2,600 adults to gain access to birth registration.\n\nTheir work has focused on covering hidden costs of registration such as transport and legal advice, and educating communities on the importance of registration.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Educational Trust have now launched an appeal on BBC Radio 4 to raise awareness of the issue and fundraise to increase support the Zimbabwe Educational Trust and Trinity Project can provide.\n\nThe appeal, which is voiced by Zimbabwean-born international speaker, author, and human rights advocate Africa Brooke, will be available to listen to on BBC Sounds until September 21. Theyll also be able to hear a live broadcast on September 18 at 3:27pm.\n\nThe appeal is presented by Zimbabwean-born international speaker, author, and human rights advocate Africa Brook\n\nIf listeners wish to make a donation to the Zimbabwe Educational Trust, they can do so by phone, cheque, or online.\n\nDerrick said: Youd never think that birth registration would be an issue.\n\nHere, people take birth certificates for granted. I hope that (this campaign) raises awareness of the challenges that people face that people just dont think about here.\n\nThe BBC Radio 4 Appeal shares the story of Precious, a mother of six. When she took two of her children to hospital for malnutrition, an issue quickly became apparent: none of her children had birth certificates.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Educational Trust and Trinity Project worked together to assign Precious a Case Officer who helped provide legal advice and accompanied Previous to the registration office.\n\nTragically, the help came too late for one of Precious sons, named Needmore, who died at just two years old from malnutrition.\n\nPrecious surviving children now have birth certificates thanks to the work of the Zimbabwe Educational Trust and Trinity Project\n\nExist to Exist  Every Childs Right to Be Seen is an appeal which aims to raise UK awareness of this issue and show people how they can help.\n\nAndrew said: We hope that this campaign gives us the momentum and resources to help some of the most vulnerable children and families to have a fair shot in life.\n\n",
