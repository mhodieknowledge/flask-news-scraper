According to the ministry, localised person-to-person transmission has been documented, often through household contact and healthcare-associated exposure, particularly in settings lacking appropriate protective measures.\n\nThe WHO is reporting ongoing outbreaks across Africa, including some Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries, raising fears of cross-border spread.\n\nThis poses a heightened risk of cross-border transmission, the ministry cautioned.\n\nIn response, Zimbabwe has scaled up disease surveillance and reinforced screening measures at all Points of Entry (PoEs).\n\nThe ministry urged the public to strictly follow WHO-recommended preventive measures, warning including avoiding physical contact with individuals showing symptoms of Mpox, sharing clothes, bedding and towels among other things.\n\nThe ministry also encouraged the public to be vigilant and act swiftly if they suspect infection. Members of the public are encouraged to report any suspected cases to the nearest health facility promptly, it said.\n\nMpox spreads primarily through close contact and can cause fever, rash, and swollen lymph nodes, sometimes leading to severe illness.\n\n",

            "content": "SundayWorld\n\nThe Pretoria High Court has delivered a historic ruling today, ordering the repatriation of former Zambian President Edgar Lungus body home for a state funeral, resolving a nearly two-month dispute that captivated the nation and resonated across southern Africa.\n\nLungu, who passed away on June 5 at Mediclinic Medforum in Pretoria during treatment for oesophageal cancer, will be laid to rest at Embassy Park in Lusaka with full military honours, as mandated by the court.\n\nThis is a matter of national dignity, said Acting Judge President Aubrey Ledwaba, delivering the ruling alongside a full bench. As a former head of state, President Lungus burial must reflect Zambias protocol and honour his service to the nation.\n\nThe decision followed a heated legal battle between the Zambian government, represented by Attorney General Mulilo Kabesha, and Lungus family, who insisted on a private burial in South Africa to honour the late Presidents alleged wish to exclude his political rival, President Hakainde Hichilema, from the proceedings.\n\nLungu, Zambias sixth president from 2015 to 2021, was a polarising figure whose death at age 68 sparked a controversy reflective of his contentious political career. His widow, Esther Lungu, and lawyer Makebi Zulu argued that Lungu had explicitly stated his wishes.\n\nMy husband was clear: he wanted President Hichilema nowhere near his funeral or his body, Esther Lungu stated in her affidavit.\n\nThe family cited past grievances, including the 2023 stripping of Lungus presidential benefits and alleged delays in approving his medical evacuation to South Africa, which they claim hastened his death.\n\nThe Zambian government, however, maintained that national law supersedes personal wishes. The burial of a former President is a state matter, as seen with President Kenneth Kaunda, Kabesha argued in court documents.\n\nThe government sought four key orders: a declaration of its exclusive right to repatriate Lungus body, the release of the body from a Pretoria funeral home to the Zambian High Commission, authorization for a state delegation to accompany the remains, and the exclusion of the familys authority over the burial process.\n\nThe court granted these requests but acknowledged the familys concerns. Judge Ledwaba noted: While we respect the familys sentiments, national protocol must prevail. We urge minimal involvement of President Hichilema to honour their wishes as far as possible.\n\nThe court dismissed an application by Zambian citizen Vincent Kafula to intervene. The applicant lacks the legal standing to influence this matter, said Ledwaba.\n\nKafula had warned that the dispute was tearing Zambia apart.\n\nThe court ordered Lungus body to be transported to Lusaka on a private chartered plane, where it will lie in state at his residence and a conference centre for public viewing before burial at Embassy Park.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Labour Court has dismissed an appeal by Watershed College Trust against an arbitral award in favour of a former probationary teacher, ruling that the institution clearly aprobated and reprobated its contractual obligations and acted unlawfully by issuing notice of termination after the expiration of the probation period.\n\nIn a judgment delivered by Justice Samuel Kudya, the court found that while the arbitrator erred in concluding that the teacher, Jenipha Madziva, had become a permanent employee, the substantive award of damages for unfair dismissal remained valid.\n\nWatershed College Trust had challenged the arbitrators ruling on five grounds, including the claim that Madziva was erroneously classified as a permanent employee and that damages were improperly awarded in US dollars. However, Justice Kudya found that only one of the grounds had merit and upheld the rest of the arbitrators findings.\n\nThe employer clearly aprobated and reprobated by writing in the probation contract that it did not intend to extend it, yet it was doing exactly that which it said it did not intend to do, the judge ruled.\n\nThe dispute arose when the school employed Madziva on a fixed-term probation contract, which was due to expire on 31 March 2023.\n\nOn that very day, the school issued a notice stating it would not be extending her contract.\n\nThe arbitrator ruled that this amounted to unlawful termination and awarded damages, prompting the appeal.\n\nKudya criticised the colleges handling of the matter, stating, Had the employer indeed intended to give notice for the termination of the probation contract, it should have done so before its expiration.  It was not remiss for the arbitrator to conclude that once parties were in the April to December phase of the contract, they were now operating in the main contract.\n\nHe added that the colleges attempt to treat the contract as terminated while simultaneously letting it roll into the next phase of employment cannot pass the unreasonableness test laid out in Hama v NRZ.\n\nOn the matter of prejudice, the court noted that unfair dismissal need not be measured by harm suffered.\n\nPrejudice is indeed not a prerequisite to find unlawful termination, Kudya said, affirming the arbitrators position that the dismissal was inherently unfair.\n\nAddressing the employers objection to the damages awarded in US dollars, the court reaffirmed Zimbabwes multi-currency framework.\n\nThere was nothing remiss by making the order which the arbitrator made.  If the employer wants to pay what was ordered using the rate of the local currency at the date of payment, nothing stops it from doing so.\n\nThe judge further dismissed the employers contention that the arbitrator had wrongly quantified the damages.\n\nIt was unnecessary to try to find out what was due when it was apparent on the contract. The res ipsa loquitur principle applies.\n\nThe judge upheld the appeal relating to the employees classification as permanent.\n\nHe ruled that the arbitral award stands, but with the correction that Madziva was not a permanent employee.\n\nWatershed College Trust was ordered to pay costs on the ordinary scale.\n\n",

I think once you show people respect, they know you were raised well. Where you come from becomes a secondary issue.\n\nDespite cultural similarities, Awa Khiwe revealed that her upbringing in a Zimbabwean village in Nkayi prepared her for life in KwaNongoma.\n\nBeing raised in the village helped me shape my cultural identity. The KwaNongoma lifestyle is similar to that of Nkayi its not a huge adjustment.\n\nAwa Khiwe, renowned for championing Ndebele pride on global stages, has opened up about embracing a more traditional role in her personal life.\n\nNow living in a new home, the outspoken rapper revealed that while many know her as a fierce and fearless queen, she proudly takes on the role of being a loved,spoiled and submissive wife to her Zulu husband.\n\nSpeaking candidly, she said she respects both Zulu and Ndebele cultures, describing the union as a beautiful exchange rather than a clash.\n\nAwa said her open-mindedness allows her to find strength in unity and mutual respect, rather than division, even in deeply rooted cultural differences.\n\nVeteran actor Ernest Ndlovu joined Awa Khiwe in KwaNongoma to celebrate her wedding day. Image: Pixel Visuals\n\nWhile fans speculated that new music inspired by the wedding might be on the way, Awa was quick to set the record straight:\n\nI have new music, but it has nothing to do with the wedding, she said. I juggle music and family, Im old enough to handle the situation.\n\nHer husband, a Qwabe man involved in the construction industry, has been in her life for years. The two met through a mutual friend, Macingwana, and nurtured their relationship quietly before tying the knot in a ceremony that honoured both families.\n\nOn social media, she called it the best day of my life and added in a heartfelt tribute:\n\nThank you for keeping your promise, my love. I promise to love, honour, respect and protect you, till death do us part.\n\n",
