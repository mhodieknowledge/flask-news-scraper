It will feature exhibitions, investment sessions, expert panel discussions, and will conclude with an awards gala celebrating outstanding achievers in the diaspora.\n\nDescribed as a premier diaspora engagement platform, the event has become an important avenue for companies and organisations seeking to expand into both the local and diaspora markets.\n\nThe organisers said the summit will bring together prospective investors while recognising individuals making notable contributions to the countrys progress.\n\nThe 3rd Edition of the Zimbabwe Diaspora Celebration & Business Summit is more than a gathering; it is a national initiative celebrating the indispensable role of Zimbabweans abroad in driving economic transformation.\n\nAccording to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, the diaspora community remitted an impressive US$2.2 billion in 2024, up from US$1.873 billion in 2023. This growth underscores the diasporas unwavering commitment to Zimbabwes socio-economic progress, said ZIDO chaiperson Blessed Kapesa.\n\nAn estimated 300 in-person participants and thousands of online viewers from around the world are expected to take part in the event.\n\nWith an expected attendance of at least 300 in-person participants and thousands of online viewers worldwide, the summit is strategically scheduled during the festive season, when many Zimbabweans in the diaspora return home.\n\nThis hybrid platform will enable participants to showcase their products, services, and investment opportunities to a global audience, amplifying visibility and engagement, he added.\n\n",

His WhatsApp number was also not receiving messages.\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that I tender my resignation from Ibhetshu LikaZulu, effective immediately, reads Sibandas letter to Fuzwayo.\n\nThis decision comes after deep reflection on the current direction and approach the organisation has taken in the struggle against Zanu PF.\n\nUnfortunately, I find that this route diverges from my own beliefs, principles, and the foundational values that Ibhetshu LikaZulu has long stood for.\n\nThis is not an easy decision. Ibhetshu LikaZulu has been a home of conscience and courage  a movement that stood firmly with the oppressed and gave voice to the voiceless.\n\nSibanda and Fuzwayo had been comrades in arms for years, in the trenches against first late President Robert Mugabe and his harsh Zanu PF regime to the current.\n\nA resolution by Zanu PF last year mandated the partys secretary for justice to initiate the process that will extend Mnangagwas second and final term, which is supposed to end in 2028. The party wants it lengthened to 2030.\n\nThe involvement of exiled former minister in Mugabes government, Jonathan Moyo, has raised the stakes as he is a known strategist and thinker.\n\nThe resolution, which has threatened to split the revolutionary institution and riddled it with factional fights, was reinforced at its recent Peoples Conference hosted in Mutare.\n\n",
