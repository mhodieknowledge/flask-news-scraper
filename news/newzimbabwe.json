            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has dismissed an application by the late former president Robert Mugabes secret son, who was seeking to be included as a beneficiary in the longtime rulers estate.\n\nThe alleged son, Tonderayi Gabriel Mugabe, was seeking condonation for the late filing of his review against the estate of the late Robert Gabriel Mugabe.\n\nIn his application, he cited Bona Nyemudzai Ouma Mutsahuni, acting in her capacity as the estates executrix and the Master of the High Court.\n\nBut High Court judge Fatima Maxwell dismissed his application, noting among other things that there was no documentation confirming that he is Mugabes son.\n\nThe inclusion of the fathers details on a birth certificate is proof of acknowledgement of paternity.\n\nThe exclusion, therefore, when the birth certificate was obtained during the lifetime of the alleged father is a clear indication that paternity was not acknowledged, said the judge.\n\nThe judge said re-registration of birth is governed by section 19 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act [Chapter 5:02].\n\nHe saidit can only be conducted where the status of a child is to be changed from being born out of wedlock to born in wedlock.\n\nSection 19 does not allow the re-registration of a birth of a child born out of wedlock whose parents never married and whose father is late.\n\nApplicant did not state that his mother ever married the late former President Robert Gabriel Mugabe.\n\nThat may be the reason why, even though the Births and Deaths Registration office might have bowed to the pressure of the name, they did not go as far as to reflect the details of the alleged father on the birth certificate.\n\nApplicant seems not to have understood the request by the Masters Office in Annexure D to obtain a birth certificate confirming his position.\n\nIt is not simply a matter of having a surname, but of having a birth certificate confirming that the alleged father is indeed the father as claimed.\n\nSuch confirmation would have been if the tendered birth certificate had the details of the father of the child.\n\nNone of the documents confirms who the father of the child is.\n\nWhilst it confirms that the applicant is a sibling of the other person tested, it does not show paternity. What it shows is that he might have been sired by one of the males related to the person who was tested.\n\nFor the above reasons, I find that the applicant has not discharged the onus of proving that he was entitled to benefit from the estate of the Late Robert Gabriel Mugabe.\n\nThere is no reason to allow the reopening of Estate Late Robert Gabriel Mugabe DR 2703/19. No basis has been laid to justify reviewing the Masters decision to confirm the account and close the estate, ruled the judge.\n\nMugabe asserted that he was the son of the former President Robert Gabriel Mugabe, having been born in Mozambique in 1977.\n\nHe presented a narrative of secretive family ties and a quest for identity within the Mugabe lineage.\n\nMugabe said he was born on 20 April 1977 in Chimoio, Mozambique to one Hilda Maeka, having been fathered by the late former president.\n\nHe said his parents met in Zimbabwe after independence, and for reasons unknown to him, his father did not want it to be disclosed to the public that he was his son until a later stage.\n\nHis mother died before the disclosure.\n\nMugabe also alleged that he would meet his father occasionally, but that was kept a secret from the first family.\n\nHe was, however, in contact with his fathers siblings, such as Bridget Mugabe, read court papers.\n\nMugabe further alleged that his father passed away before he was formally introduced to the Mugabe family.\n\nThe estate was advertised, and he notified the executor, Bona Mugabe, about his claim and the fact that he was the deceaseds son.\n\nAccording to court documents, Bonas lawyers requested a DNA Test.\n\nThe DNA tests confirmed that he was born of the Mugabe parental lineage.\n\nThrough a Notarial Deed of Change of Name, he changed his name from Tonderayi Maeka to Tonderayi Gabriel Mugabe.\n\nHe then approached Bona and her lawyers, but was not entertained.\n\nOn the 2nd of June 2023, he then learnt that the estate was closed on 18th of December 2020 by confirmation of the account.\n\nMugabe said he attempted to obtain a declaratory order for the reopening of the Estate of Late Gabriel Mugabe under case number HCH 3729/23 but was not successful.\n\nDespite these claims, the High Court also found the application for condonation lacking in merit, primarily due to his failure to provide a satisfactory explanation for the substantial delay of over four years in pursuing his claims.\n\nThe degree of non-compliance is inordinate, and the explanations given are rife with gaps, ruled the judge, emphasising the need for clear and convincing evidence in matters of inheritance.\n\nThe court deliberated on various factors, including the significance of the alleged heirs delay, which was described as inexplicable by the judge.\n\nWhile the applicant claims a right to the estate, he has not established a reasonable basis for the delay in filing his application, Justice Maxwell articulated, reinforcing the gravity of procedural timelines in legal proceedings.\n\nIn dismissing the application, the court cautioned against potential prejudice to the rightful beneficiaries of the Mugabe estate.\n\nThe balance of convenience favours the dismissal of this application as the deserving beneficiaries of the Estate Late Robert Gabriel Mugabe would be greatly prejudiced by the reversal of a process that was completed more than four years ago, said the judge.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nA white South African farm worker accused of killing two black women says he was forced to feed their bodies to pigs, according to lawyers.\n\nAdrian de Wet is one of three men facing murder charges after Maria Makgato, 45, and Lucia Ndlovu, 34, were killed while allegedly looking for food on a farm near Polokwane in South Africas northern Limpopo province last year.\n\nTheir bodies were then alleged to have been given to pigs in an apparent attempt to dispose of the evidence.\n\nMr De Wet, 20, turned state witness when the trial started on Monday and says farm owner Zachariah Johannes Olivier shot and killed the two women.\n\nMs Makgato and Ms Ndlovu were searching for soon-to-expire dairy products which had been left for pigs when they were killed.\n\nMr De Wet, a supervisor on the farm, will testify that he was under duress when he was forced to throw their bodies into the pig enclosure, according to both the prosecution and his lawyer.\n\nIf the court accepts his testimony, all charges against him will be dropped.\n\nThe case has sparked outrage across South Africa, exacerbating racial tensions in the country.\n\nSuch tension is especially rife in rural areas, despite the end of the racist system of apartheid more than 30 years ago. Most private farmland remains in the hands of the white minority, while most farm workers are black and poorly paid, fuelling resentment among the black population, while many white farmers complain of high crime rates.\n\nWilliam Musora, 50, another farm worker, is the third accused. He and Mr Olivier, 60, are yet to enter a plea and remain behind bars.\n\nThe three men also face charges of attempted murder for shooting at Ms Ndlovus husband, who was with the women at the farm  as well as possession of an unlicensed firearm and obstructing justice for allegedly dumping the bodies in the pig enclosure in an attempt to conceal evidence.\n\nMr Musora, a Zimbabwean national, faces an additional charge under South Africas Immigration Act over his status as an illegal immigrant.\n\nThe Limpopo High Court was packed with supporters and relatives of the victims ahead of proceedings. Also present was Mr Oliviers wife, who was seated in the front row of the public gallery and could be seen wiping away tears.\n\nMembers of opposition party Economic Freedom Fighters, which has previously called for the farm to be shut down, were also present in the courtroom.\n\nThe trial was postponed to next week.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa has conceded that South Africa is grappling with the United States decision to impose a30% tariff on local imports, but insists the country is not alone in facing mounting global trade challenges.\n\nIn his weekly newsletter, Ramaphosa described the new US tariffs as a stark reminder of the urgent need to adapt to increasingly turbulent headwinds in international trade.\n\nThe US is South Africas second-largest trading partner by country, and these measures will have a considerable impact on industries that rely heavily on exports to that country and on the workers they employ, as well as on our fiscus, he said.\n\nSectors such as agriculture, automotive and textiles have historically benefited from duty-free access to the US market under the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which now faces disruption.\n\nRamaphosa said that South Africas trade relationship with the US has historically been complementary, saying local exports do not compete with US producers and do not pose a threat to US industry.\n\nLargely, our exports are inputs into US industries and therefore support the United States industrial base, he said.\n\nSouth Africa is also the biggest investor from the African continent into the US, with 22 of our companies investing in a number of sectors including mining, chemicals, pharmaceuticals and the food chain.\n\nThe 30% tariff was recently announced by the Trump administration and will take effect on 7 August.\n\nSouth Africa is the only country in sub-Saharan Africa singled out for the steep tariff, reflecting deteriorating relations between Pretoria and Washington.\n\nOther African countries, such as Lesotho and Zimbabwe, will face a 15% tariff from the same date.\n\nThe announcement is a significant blow to South Africas economy, particularly as the government had been working to strengthen trade ties with the US.\n\nThis included deals on liquefied natural gas imports, easing poultry import regulations and investments in US industries.\n\nRamaphosa defended South African imports, arguing they ultimately benefit US consumers through greater variety and lower costs.\n\nFor example, citrus production is counter-seasonal and does not pose a threat to US production, he said.\n\nFurthermore, production by US companies has been on the decline due to low yields, citrus greening disease and other factors unrelated to competition from imports.\n\nSouth Africa, the worlds second-largest citrus exporter, has helped to stabilise supply and prices in the US market.\n\nWe have been engaging the United States to enhance mutually beneficial trade and investment relations. All channels of communication remain open, said Ramaphosa.\n\nOur foremost priority is protecting our export industries.\n\nHe said the government would continue to engage with US officials while also accelerating efforts to diversify export markets, particularly within Africa.\n\nWith a view to helping our producers and exporters aggressively explore alternative markets, we have established an Export Support Desk to assist affected producers, he said.\n\nRamaphosa added that details of a support package for companies, producers and workers impacted by the tariffs would be announced soon.\n\nHe said the intervention would also assist industries seeking to expand into regions such as the rest of Africa, Asia, the Middle East and other existing trade agreement markets.\n\nStrengthening regional value chains will be key to building resilience for our export markets in the longer term, he said.\n\nMuch as strengthening and establishing alternative value chains will take time, this moment presents us with an opportunity to push forward with the implementation and expansion of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).\n\nRamaphosa stressed the need to reduce South Africas dependence on specific export markets, calling it a strategic imperative to build economic resilience.\n\nIn the coming months, we will be scaling up our trade missions into new markets in Africa and beyond, as well as the National Exporter Development Programme, whose aim is to grow the pool of export-ready companies, he said.\n\nTrump has opposed several South African policies, including land expropriation, which he controversially claimed allowed land to be taken from white farmers.\n\nThe Presidency has firmly denied such claims,including that one of genocide on white farmers.\n\nRamaphosa met with Trump in May in a bid to mend relations, but no progress was made as things had gone worse.\n\nDespite growing tensions, Ramaphosa insisted that South Africa is not alone in facinghigh tariffs.\n\nA number of export-reliant developed and developing economies, including several on the continent, are also grappling with these measures, he said.\n\nThe international trading system is changing. Complacency will not serve us, and building resilience is imperative.\n\nMeanwhile, the Minister of Departments of Trade, Industry and Competition Parks Tau and Minister of International Relations and Cooperation Ronald Lamola will be having a joint press briefing on Monday morning to address the issue of high tariffs.\n\nThe briefing will take place at 10 a.m. at the Germiston Civic Centre, in Ekurhuleni.\n\nMeanwhile on Saturday,ANC NEC member Dr Kgosientsho Ramokgopatold journalists there had been a spirited and robust discussion on the US tariffs.\n\nHe said negotiations between the US and South Africa were ongoing, and expressed confidence that the two nations would be able to find each other.\n\n",

Consequently, street vending and night vending activities are also banned. Please take note, street fathers.\n\nThe minister cited concerns over illegal drug and substance deals taking place under the cover of night vending, warning that such activities pose a threat to public health, the economy, and national security.\n\nGarwe urged Harare City Council to work closely with the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) to enforce the directive.\n\nHe called on law enforcement agencies to implement existing by-laws with sensitivity, especially in light of past incidents where civilians were injured during street clean-up operations.\n\nIn the past, when street clean-ups were initiated, there was no need to harass anyone. You can begin by engaging associations representing the vendors, Garwe said.\n\nEnforcement should not be about being tough or brutal. Please carry it out in a humane manner. We must educate the public while making tough decisions.\n\nHe also called on the Council to urgently address the worsening traffic congestion in the city.\n\nThe current state of traffic is unacceptable.
