            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Gibson Mandaza has granted Alpha Media Holdings journalist Blessed Mhlanga bail.\n\nThis followed his successful appeal through his lawyers, Advocate Thabani Mpofu and Chris Mhike.\n\nThe accused be and is hereby granted bail. He is to deposit US$500 bail with the clerk of court, said the judge.\n\nThere are indeed changed circumstances. Im of the view that the court a quo misdirected itself. The appellant is a permanent resident of this country.\n\nTo allay the fears, the state can place conditions to ensure that he does not interfere and abscond.\n\nThe judge said the fear of interference does not stand because the docket is now complete.\n\nThe appeal was his second before the High Court.\n\nMhlanga had been denied bail thrice.\n\nHis lawyer, Advocate Thabani Mpofu, who is taking instructions from Chris Mhike, urged the judge to grant the journalist freedom, submitting that there have been changed circumstances.\n\nMpofu said Mhlanga was locked up following calls for protests by war veteran Blessed Geza, but people did not flood the streets as called for.\n\nThe lawyer also said that when Geza called for a national shutdown, people went on with their business.\n\nWe submit that there was an obvious change in circumstances and the court a quo misdirected itself in dealing with a question that was placed before it.\n\nThere have been changes that serve to address the concerns that were initially raised by the courts in denying the appellant bail.\n\nThe charge is transmitting material with the intention of inciting violence. It is critical to consider the importance of the charge.\n\nIt was transmission linked to an event or events and this said, the appellant is a journalist, he asked questions in an interview and answers were given, so if there is an allegation that material meant to incite violence was transmittedthe time of the protests has come and gone.\n\nMay this court take judicial notice that the first call of protest was made and there were no people who flooded the streets.\n\nThere was a call for a national shutdown, but people went on with their business.\n\nWhat is alleged by the state to be the transmission of inciting messages has come and gone. What has not come and gone is the continuity of the incarceration of the appellant in jail.\n\nPart of the reasons for denying bail was that there might be disturbance of peacedisturbance in connection with the event.\n\nMpofu said there was no violence in the country, adding that even the judge, being a Zimbabwean, has noticed this.\n\nMhlanga has filed an application seeking direct access to the Constitutional Court, arguing that he was unlawfully arrested and charged.\n\nThe passage of time in this matter must constitute a changed circumstance. It constitutes a change in circumstance that entitles the appellant to bail.\n\nIf there is no evidence that links him to the crime, he should not be in jail, Mpofu said.\n\nIn challenging the granting of bail to Mhlanga, the state said there is electronic and video evidence.\n\nThe police said they have overwhelming evidence. This means they have gathered the evidence. They have assessed it and came to the conclusion that it is overwhelming. Under those circumstances, there has been a passage of time, and all the witnesses have been interviewed.\n\nSo, My Lord, there is no longer evidence to be interfered with.\n\nThe protests have come and gone.\n\nThat has to have changed circumstances, he said.\n\nFungai Nyahunzvi, representing the state, said prosecution is still opposed to bail.\n\nHe said the argument that Mhlanga has not interfered with witnesses and evidence does not stand and does not change the complexion of the case.\n\nThe fear is still being held. The trial date has now been given.\n\nOne circumstance that has changed is that there has been passage of time, which has given the state time to prepare for trial, and now we are saying we are now ready for trial.\n\nIf we had not done so may be the argument that they have failed to give us a trial date would have helped their case, he said.\n\nHe also said that if granted bail, he might influence witnesses not to testify.\n\nAs we speak, there are people who are appearing in this court after taking heed of the calls to protests so we still have that fear, said the prosecutor.\n\n",

Collaboration, not confrontation, is the path to sustainable progress.\n\n",

Whilst the exchange rate and inflation have been brought under control, the availability of ZWG remains limited, thereby negatively impacting potential revenue streams, the company said.\n\nProplastics said the increase in the foreign currency surrender requirement from 25% to 30% for exports has not only eroded the competitiveness of our exports but has also negatively impacted overall market positioning and exporting viability.\n\nRevenue for the first quarter was primarily received in US$, with US$ payments dominating transactions throughout the period.\n\nIn the current quarter, the formal market, particularly the retail sector, the company made appeals for a reduction in the cost of doing business and the removal of informal sector advantages.\n\nDespite the prevailing liquidity issues, the quarterly sales volumes grew by 11% over the prior period. Revenue grew by 3% to US$4,263 million against US$4,123 million achieved in the prior period, without any export contribution recorded in the current quarter.\n\nProduction volumes also increased by 11% against the previous period, as the business cleared supply backlogs and replenished stocks for high-demand products.

In contrast, domestic tourism has experienced a slight decline.\n\nKey source markets driving international interest in Victoria Falls include Europe, particularly the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Germany, largely due to the availability of dedicated tour packages, said Farawo, adding that South Africa continues to be the largest source of visitors, followed closely by Botswana.\n\nEnhanced accessibility through the expansion of Victoria Falls International Airport, along with the introduction of new flight routes, including direct flights from Frankfurt, has further facilitated the growing interest among German tourists, he said.\n\nThe implementation of the KAZA UniVisa, which simplifies cross-border travel between Zimbabwe and Zambia, has also played a role in encouraging visitors to explore both sides of the falls, offering a more seamless travel experience for tourists from many countries, Farawo added.\n\nLocated on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, Victoria Falls is one of the worlds largest waterfalls, renowned for its rich biodiversity in flora and fauna.\n\n",

Management is working closely with tenants to resolve the arrears.\n\nManagement will continue to adapt its strategies to protect shareholder value and sustain business operations.

It was a private and dignified cultural pilgrimage to the historical heartland of the Ndebele peoplea journey marked by mutual respect, peaceful engagement, and cultural significance.\n\nKing Bulelanis presence at Town House was at the behest of Coltart, who had invited him for a meeting wherein they discussed the honouring of certain culturally important days and historically significant sites around Bulawayo.\n\nGarwe responded after images of Coltart and the King were sent on X.\n\nHe went on to express shock, disgust, claimed the Ndebele throne was defunct, described King Bulelani as self-styled and urged Bulawayo not to recognise him.\n\nAdded King Bulelani in response: We respectfully urge public officials to exercise caution, decorum, and cultural sensitivity when speaking on matters of heritage and traditional leadership.\n\nDismissive language or threats of arrest directed at a traditional and cultural figurewhose mission is reconciliation, unity, and empowermentdo not reflect the spirit of Ubuntu or the values enshrined in Pan-Africanism.\n\n",
