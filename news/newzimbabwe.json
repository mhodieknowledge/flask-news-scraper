Zimbabwe has been hit by regular power outages in recent years, often lasting most of the day, due to a lack of generation capacity.\n\nMission 300, which the banks unveiled at a conference in Tanzania in January, aims to bring electricity to 300 million people in sub-Saharan Africa by 2030 at a cost of tens of billions of dollars sourced from development finance institutions and private investors. The region is home to about 83% of the 680 million people globally who dont have access to electricity.\n\nDespite having abundant renewable energy potential, Zimbabwe continues to face critical energy challenges, July Moyo, the countrys energy minister, wrote in the plan, titledZimbabwes National Energy Compact.As of 2024, 38% of the population lacks access to electricity.\n\nZimbabwes ambitions of benefiting from the program are complicated by the fact that it has been in default to multilateral lenders  including the World Bank  for a quarter of a century. That means it cant borrow money from them and the finance it needs will have to come largely from private investors.\n\nUnder the plan Zimbabwe plans to seek:\n\nGhana, Togo, Mozambique and Burundi are also scheduled to present their plans at the conference, which isnt open to the media, on Wednesday. Eleven countries, including the Democratic Republic of Congo and Nigeria, disclosed their blueprints to boost electrification at the Tanzania conference.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has implored economic agents to ignore annual ZWG inflation rates, arguing the stats have no bearing on pricing dynamics.\n\nThis comes afterinflation statistics by the Zimbabwe National Statistics Agency (Zimstat)revealedthat annual inflation surged to 92,1% in the month of September 2025.\n\nThe developments recently triggered an outcry from industry, which blamed the September 2024 43% local currency devaluation directive for pushing up the inflationary pressures. The business community also contends that the high ZWG annual inflation rates pose challenges for businesses, particularly due to the impact on interest rates.\n\nBut in a statement Wednesday, the RBZ governor, Dr John Mushayavanhu, said the transition from the ZW$ to ZWG-denominated prices inevitably created a statistical gap in the calculation of annual inflation figures. This resulted in Zimstat computing and publishing yearly inflation in April 2015 after obtaining a full year of ZWG prices.\n\nThe RBZ therefore, advised the public that the recorded rise in year-on-year ZWG inflation in April and May 2025 is primarily due to the base effect emanating from the once-off spike in monthly inflation from 5,8% in September 2024 to 37,2% in October 2024.\n\nThe current trend in annual inflation is expected to continue up to September 2025 and decline thereafter to align with the current low and stable monthly inflation. The current annual inflation will therefore not affect consumer purchasing power and value preservation, as the inflation impact has already been realised, said Mushayavanhu.\n\nThe central bank exchequer said going forward, the economy is projected to decline to 30% by 31 December 2025 and to further decline towards single-digit levels in the outlook period.\n\nConsidering the current pricing circumstances where annual ZiG inflation is not reflective of the current pricing dynamics, the RBZ encourages economic agents to focus on month-on-month inflation, which has a more direct link to current ZWG purchasing power expectations.\n\nThe monthly ZWG inflation will remain low and stable as Monetary Policy remains appropriately tight to balance price stability and economic growth, added Mushayavanhu.\n\n",
