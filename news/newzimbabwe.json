            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFormer Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) leader Nelson Chamisa on Thursday announced plans to launch a new political movement in a fresh bid to dislodge Zanu PF from power.\n\nChamisa resigned from the CCC in January 2024 citing that his party had been hijacked by Zanu PF leader and President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nThis followed a period of turmoil after self-appointed CCC Secretary-General Sengezo Tshabangu went on a rampage, recalling councillors and members of Parliament, particularly those backing Chamisa and critical of Zanu PF.\n\nTshabangu further barred recalled CCC members from participating in by-elections under the CCC banner, leaving many MPs and councillors out in the cold.\n\nHaving kept a low profile for some time, Chamisa has now begun signalling a return to full-time politics, dispelling the notion that he was done with the political arena.\n\nI want you to know; I am not idle. I am consulting. I am building. I am assembling a new strategy and a citizens team that will carry and pivot this nation unto greatness and stardom, Chamisa wrote on his X account, Thursday.\n\nHe described his departure from the CCC as disembarking from a ship that was leaking and could have jeopardised the democratic project he is striving to realise in Zimbabwe.\n\nI left CCC but not the mission. All because CCC was never the destination. It was just the vehicle meant to take us to the New Zimbabwe. When that vehicle was compromised, it became necessary to step out and prepare a better, cleaner, fit-for-purpose vehicle, he explained.\n\nChamisa further acknowledged the mistakes he made during his time at the helm of the CCC.\n\nOur approach in 2023 was not the same as 2018, because in the fight against oppression, no strategy is cast in stone. This is a battle to save lives and to save a nation. We sometimes miss. We sometimes omit. We commit. We adjust. We correct. We keep moving forward until we win. And win we must.\n\nNone of this would have been possible without you.\n\n",

She therefore has no capacity to interfere with members of the ZRP investigating this case.\n\nThe accused is a fit candidate for bail. She is a mother of two and the solebreadwinner of her family.\n\nIn addition to her children, she also takes care of a niece who is totally dependent on her and also her mother, aged 70.\n\nMhike said Zaba is of fixed abode, adding that she is employed as an editor.\n\nShe needs to go back to work soon after she recuperates from her current ill health.\n\nThe accused before you is an award-winning journalist well respected in Zimbabwe Media, commercial, human rights and philanthropic circles, he said.\n\nCourt was also told of her other colourful accolades in media circles, including being the Secretary General of the Zimbabwe National Editors Forum (ZINEF), a mentor, and a member of the Women in News organisation, as such a responsible person to be trusted with freedom.\n\nThis shows she is a distinguished member of the society, Mhike said.\n\nThe lawyer also said Zaba did not give the police trouble when she was arrested.\n\nShe made every effort to honour the request by the police for her to attend at the police station.\n\nShe voluntarily walked into Harare Central Police Station in the company of her lawyer.\n\nIt is regrettable that the police did not allow her to go home after the recording of her warned and cautioned statement, he said.\n\nCitizens who honour and respect authorities ought to be spared from harsh prison realities. As indicated, the accused is not feeling well and the veracity of that submission is documented.\n\nHowever, Mhike raised a complaint against the police, saying, Our complaint is that the accused was detained overnight even in the face of comprehensive medical documentation confirming that she was on bed rest on the order of a medical doctor.\n\nJambawu said police officers and some of Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) employees are lined up to testify against Zaba.\n\nZaba is represented by Mhike andNontokozo Dube Tachiona.\n\n",

            "content": "How Sports Calendars Influence Betting Traffic\n\nBetting activity across digital platforms rises and falls with the sports calendar. Major events like championships, finals, and international tournaments generate sharp increases in betting volume. Off-season months usually show lower engagement, especially when fewer games are broadcast live.\n\nIn Ethiopia, this pattern is clear across mobile and desktop users. Platforms backed by digital operators like thehttp://www.1xbet.et/enoften see traffic peaks tied directly to the sports schedule. Understanding these trends helps users and platform managers plan effectively.\n\nSeasonal Traffic Spikes in Digital Betting\n\nThe busiest times for betting platforms usually match the biggest events on the sports calendar. These include football tournaments, tennis majors, Formula 1 weekends, and basketball playoffs. During these periods, user activity multiplies. Bettors place more wagers, watch more games, and engage with bonus offers more frequently.\n\nThis pattern repeats yearly. For example, when national leagues like Serie A or the Premier League resume, mobile traffic increases immediately. Bettors check form tables, injury news, and live match data. Matches involving top clubs or intense rivalries often double or triple usual bet counts.\n\nDuring these periods, users are also more likely to search for1xbet downloadand install apps that allow fast access and live tracking. This helps them follow odds, place in-play bets, and track results in real time.\n\nQuiet Periods and Regional Differences\n\nNot all months bring equal traffic. Off-season periods, especially in sports with fixed seasons, cause a clear drop in betting volume. Many users reduce their activity or shift attention to virtual games, slot tournaments, or casino sections. Betting platforms must adapt by offering seasonal bonuses or alternate gaming options.\n\nRegional differences also matter. In Ethiopia, public interest rises more around football and athletics. Less attention is paid to sports like baseball or ice hockey, which remain niche. Platforms adjust accordingly, highlighting popular events and shifting promotional focus.\n\nSome users prefer alternate content during these slower months. Pages such ashttp://www.1xbet.et/en/casinooffer options beyond seasonal betting. Games, quick rounds, and live dealers keep traffic flowing even without major sports on the calendar.\n\nLegal Restrictions and Event Timing\n\nSome traffic shifts occur due to temporary rules or media blackouts. If an event is delayed or moved, betting activity often drops sharply. Regulatory pauses, such as temporary bans or restricted bet types, also affect platform traffic.\n\nEven the suggestion of havingbetting bannedfor a short period can lead to user drop-off. This effect is short-lived if the platform offers alternative content and clear updates. Communication helps retain users until regular service returns.\n\nTime zones also affect traffic. When matches are broadcast late at night, fewer casual users place live bets. Platform managers track data to see which time slots work best for engagement.\n\nHow Platforms Manage Fluctuations\n\nTo respond to seasonal highs and lows, betting platforms adjust their operations. They increase ad campaigns before big tournaments and cut back during quiet periods. They may also offer time-limited deals or mobile-only promos during the off-season.\n\nHere is how platforms keep traffic consistent:\n\nPlatforms also track trends to decide when to promote new features. Updates, bug fixes, and content expansions are often timed to land before big sports days, not during them.\n\nWhat Users Can Learn from Traffic Trends\n\nUsers benefit by following the same patterns. Betting during major events means better odds, more promotions, and greater access to data. Off-season periods offer slower pace and sometimes more generous loyalty rewards.\n\nTracking sports calendars helps users manage expectations and balance their betting activity. High-traffic times are ideal for testing new bet types or competing in leaderboards. Quiet months offer chances to explore casino games, try new features, or reset strategies.\n\nPlatforms that support both seasonal and non-seasonal content retain more users over time. Users who follow the calendar and adjust their habits stay more informed and more consistent in their approach. In regions like Ethiopia, this balance is key to building long-term interest indigital sports engagement.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nLocal grainmilling companies have raised concerns over the invasion of stipulated reserved sectors by foreign nationals.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of an engagement with the Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe(GMAZ), small millers from Bulawayo said the milling sector reserved for locals under the law is now being invaded by foreigners, particularly Pakistanis.\n\nOne local miller, James Kamono, who owns Marula Milling Company, said the foreigners were trading mealie meals at questionable prices.\n\nThe Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act in Zimbabwe reserves certain sectors, including grain milling, for ownership by Zimbabwean citizens. This means that, in principle, only businesses owned by locals are permitted to operate in these sectors.\n\nOne of the challenges we are having as small millers is the invasion of this reserved sector by foreign nationals, Kamono said.\n\nThese foreign nationals, particularly the Pakistanis, are selling mealie meals at low and questionable prices. This has lowered our production and sales, he lamented.\n\nKamono called on the government to put stiffer policies and penalties to safeguard the reserved sector for locals.\n\nWe spoke about indigenisation and the reserved sector, but I think we need to push more on that issue of indigenisation and the reserved sector because we have so many foreigners opening their milling companies and that is affecting our operations, he added.\n\nAnother Southern Region milling company owner, Mthandazo Moyoof Shakata Investments, said the invasion of the sector by the Pakistanis was worsening the burden of the already struggling milling businesses.\n\nThe big problem that we are facing is financial muscle. As a small miller we do not have the capital to buy many tonnes of maize and the situation is worsened by foreigners who are taking over the sectors reserved for locals, said Moyo.\n\nMeanwhile, milling companies welcomed the efforts by Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ), which is set to facilitate the movement of maize from the Northern to the Southern Region of the country as part of government efforts to ensure food security.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of a meeting, GMAZ Southern Region Vice Chair, Mthokozisi Sibanda said movement of maize will permit farmers to access more markets while allowing small millers to access raw materials at a better cost.\n\nWe want to appreciate the Government in ensuring there is food security in the Southern Region. As we speak right now most millers are seized with buying local maize as you know for the past few years we have been importing from abroad and currently we have been asked by the Government to assist our local farmers in selling and exploring the local market, Sibanda said.\n\nHe added that localtrade will allow a quick turnover in the movement of maize.\n\nMost millers are seized with that opportunity and we want to appreciate that because that comes in handy.\n\nLocal purchases of grain are key over the turnover of the movement of maize we want to bring it from the northern Region into the Southern Region which might take a day or so which is an advantage and is key to our milling plants as we bring that necessary raw material, said the GMAZ vice Chairperson.\n\nAccording to Sibanda, the movement of maize from the Northern Region will allow the country to fully utilize the local milling capacity.\n\nNot only that, the export of labour has stopped, particularly over our milling plants. We are now buying locally, promoting the local farmers and improving our capacity utilisation of our milling plants.\n\nThis is key in our industrial development, national development, as well as our GDP.\n\n",

Collaborating with Nvidia gives us the advanced computing capabilities needed to drive Africas AI innovation while strengthening the continents digital independence, Masiyiwa stated in a press release.\n\nNvidia will reportedly implement thousands of GPUs, which power its high-performance supercomputers, and intertwine its AI software using NVIDIA Cloud Partner reference architectures.\n\nCassava president Hardy Pemhiwa revealed that 3,000 Nvidia GPUs would be embedded into their South African facility in June before installing 9,000 more across Kenya, Nigeria, Morocco, and Egypt over the next three to four years. Masiyiwa,Bloombergreports, is prepared to invest up to $720 million in the project.\n\nThe future comes from young people building apps and solutions, small businesses every day across this continent using AI, Masiyiwa said at the Global AI Summit on Africa 2025 in Kigali in April where he was a co-chair. They are the digital natives, and we just have given them the ability to do what they do best.\n\nAfrica has the unprecedented opportunity of becoming a global tech leader, boasting ample resources, worldwide investment, and the biggest (and youngest) untapped market in the world.\n\nAround 600 million Africans still lack reliable access to electricity, a figure that experts believe will subside thanks to the continents push for renewable energy and growing access to mobile internet services, such as Starlink.\n\nFintechs and AI startups are abundant from Nairobi to Accra, but the continents limited tech infrastructure and low digital literacy rates continue to squeeze its known potential of leading the AI revolution.\n\nThe Future of Jobs Report 2025by the World Economic Forum identified a critical skills gap in Africa, with over 60% of companies believing it to be one of the most significant barriers to business transfer formation by 2030.\n\nNew, cutting-edge technology now beckons for the continent; Nvidia-powered AI factories are set to seemingly streamline AI development through an optimized ecosystem supporting algorithm development, model experimentation, and data pipelines.\n\nAkin to a startup incubator, but on a mass, online scale, the proposed AI factory is designed to foster innovation and accelerate African AI development by connecting local businesses, governments, and researchers to high-performance AI infrastructure while alleviating them from the financial burdensome Nvidia-built GPUs cost thousands of dollarsof investing in hardware.\n\nBuilding digital infrastructure for the AI economy is a priority if Africa is to take full advantage of the fourth industrial revolution, added Masiyiwa in the press statement.\n\nOur AI Factory provides the infrastructure for this innovation to scale, empowering African businesses, startups, and researchers with access to cutting-edge AI infrastructure to turn their bold ideas into real-world breakthroughsand now, they dont have to look beyond Africa to get it.\n\n",
