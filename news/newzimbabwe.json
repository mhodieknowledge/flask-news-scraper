He was the face of the March 31 protest, which later morphed to a mass stay-away.\n\nZanu PF National Political Commissar Munyaradzi Machacha\n\nIn a video posted by Zanu PF apparatchiks on social media while addressing party members at an undisclosed location, Machacha reveals that he is related to Geza, who is his uncle and, therefore, speaks authoritatively of a person he has known for years.\n\nI acknowledge that Geza is my uncle. You heard him rant that l am his nephew, yes, its true. I am not speaking of a person that l am not familiar with. We were together at Chimoio during the war, said Machacha.\n\nHe went further to allege the staunch Mnangagwa critic never spent a single day at Chimoio Camp but engrossed himself in stealing from the logistics warehouse and reselling goods to villagers from nearby settlements.\n\nThere was a big hall which served as a logistics warehouse where clothes for guerilla fighters were stored. Bombshell would go there and steal jeans and shirts, which he would go and sell in the villages or exchange for beer or cigarettes.\n\nHe literally never spent a single day in camp. Each morning, he would go around villages and get chicken, beer cigarettes and Saraveji, claimed Machacha.\n\nHe further claimed that despite the corporal punishment Geza received, including flogging on the buttocks by security details at the camp, he was unrepentant.\n\nMachacha explained that following Gezas recruitment for training in Romania he displayed his dishonesty and penchant for finer things in life prompting him to misrepresent to Romanian authorities that he was nationalist Robert Mugabes son and was accorded Very Important Person (VIP) treatment.\n\nThe correct fact was that Gezas elder brother was married to Mugabes sister.\n\nHe would be chauffeured in limousines around Romania, said Machacha.\n\nUpon Independence in 1980, the commissar went on, Geza was enlisted into the army where he would beg to get promotion not based on merit.\n\nMachacha claimed at one time during the Mozambican military operation, Geza tricked FRELIMO soldiers whom he intoxicated before stripping their Scania trucks of their engines, which he smuggled into Zimbabwe.\n\nAmong other charges, Geza was accused of raiding white commercial farmers of their cattle during the land reform and grabbing abattoirs, where he would slaughter the stolen beasts for sale.\n\nAlso, during the Chiadzwa diamond rush, Geza was appointed Mbada Diamonds security officer and looted the mineral, Machacha said.\n\nThe commissar claims Gezas beef with President Mnangagwa stems from the formers disqualification from contesting the 2018 elections to represent Sanyati constituency because he had a pending rape case involving a local school girl.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner atMadzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. This week we want to discuss regulatory sandboxes for fintech start-ups in Zimbabwe. What is a regulatory sandbox, and why is it necessary for fintech start-ups in Zimbabwe?\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nYour question is in 2 parts, I will start by explaining what a fintech is before I attempt to explain a regulatory sandbox for the fintech industry and why it is necessary for fintech start-ups in Zimbabwe.\n\nA fintech is a company that relies mainly, if not solely, on technology and cloud services to provide financial services to its customers. It is not limited by the need to have your traditional brick and mortar to be able to provide these services. Services that may be provided by such fintech solutions include payments, savings, investments, borrowing of finances and many others. The idea being to make it easier and accessible for the consumer to transact and benefit from such services.\n\nSandboxes, on the other hand, are controlled or isolated testing environments that allow innovators to test their new product or service without the burdensome requirement of complying with all applicable regulations affecting that particular product.\n\nAnd now to the why of your question. Complying with financial regulations may in some instances prove to be expensive for a start-up fintech company and the use of a sandbox allows the start up to speed up entry into the market, identify and hopefully mitigate, if not remedy, any risk that would have potentially bedevilled the start-up following a straight to market launch in the absence of a sandbox.\n\nReporter: What is the difference thenbetweena regulatory sandbox and an innovation hub?\n\nVM: Innovation hubs, in general terms, involve the sharing of ideas between innovators and or with their regulators, which may include guidance on regulations by the regulators as they work on providing solutions to the problems in that sector. Sandboxes allow for the actual experimentation of how the product will work in a live market without necessarily being subjected to the obligation of adhering to prevailing regulations for market entry.\n\nReporter:Is Zimbabwe conducive for a Fintech sandbox?\n\nVM: Well, these fintech sandboxes are a common trend in the world and particularly in Africa. Traditionally, Zimbabwe has proved to be adaptive to new methods of utilizing financial technology. The country remains conducive because the economy is heavily reliant on cash for transactions and a significant percentage of the population is unbanked and operating their businesses outside the formal financial channels, providing such sandboxes encourages more innovators to bring out products that may mop the unbanked liquidity into the formal market with the added benefit of including this unbanked demography into the beneficial financial services offered to the formalized market.\n\nReporter:In Zimbabwe, which laws regulate fintech sandboxes?\n\nVM: We have the Fintech Regulatory Guidelines of 2021 from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, which, among other things, provide guidance and requirements for potential participants to test their products in a live environment while at the same time prioritizing consumer safety and protection.\n\nThe guidelines also encourage collaboration between the startup fintechs and the traditional financial sector, in which the innovative technology intends to improve by the launch of their product.\n\nWe also have the Securities and Exchange Commission of Zimbabwe Regulatory Sandbox guidelines of 2024 which are aimed at facilitating capital market fintech innovations.\n\nReporter: What are the real benefits of the sandbox and is it useful?\n\nVM: Besides the obvious benefit of reducing the cost to the innovator in the testing phase, which is about 24 months, it allows constant interaction between the innovator and the regulator, creating an environment where the regulator understands the operations of the fintech product. This will prove highly useful should there be a need to lobby for policy changes to accommodate disruptive technology.\n\nI am also personally of the view that the sandbox allows for easier fundraising as there will be a clear blueprint of how the product works, plus the common hurdle of regulatory approval will have been passed and consumer appetite tested.\n\nReporter: How is an innovator assured that the innovation will not be distributed to competitors during the application and testing periods?\n\nVM: The Reserve Bank guidelines on Fintech Regulatory sandbox provide that all information provided by the innovator will be treated as confidential and any disclosure to any third party will first require the approval of the innovator unless the disclosure has been ordered by a court order or under any law.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima, we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

Residents in the areas mentioned should prepare and cooperate with our teams starting early morning, said Gama.\n\nFurthermore, the CoH said it is conducting awareness campaigns to residents of Mbare on how to prevent further outbreaks.\n\nThe teams will also be conducting awareness campaigns on factors that accelerate such infestations e.g overcrowding and how to prevent infestations even in these overcrowded areas. Community volunteers are going to be required for optimum spraying coverage.\n\nIt is, therefore, important for residents in and around Mbare Flats and other areas to be aware of the factors that lead to such infestations. Residents are also urged to help control the spreads through extensive community participation.\n\nSpraying alone will not solve this problem. Bed bugs hide in small crevices on beds, sofas, wardrobes, walls, e.t.c thus regular physical cleaning is required where chemicals cant reach, said Gama.\n\n",
