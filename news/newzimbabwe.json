            "content": "AP\n\nGisle Pelicot spoke of her very difficult ordeal after 51 men were convicted Thursday in the drugging-and-rape trial that riveted France andturned her into an icon, expressing support for other victims whose cases dont get such attention and whose stories remain untold.\n\nI want you to know that we share the same fight, she said in her first words after the court in the southern French city of Avignon handed down prison sentences ranging from three to 20 years inthe shocking casethat spurreda national reckoning about the blight of rape culture.\n\nGisele Pelicot arrives at the court house in Avignon for the verdicts. (AP Photo/Lewis Joly)\n\nPelicots ex-husband,Dominique Pelicot, and all but one of his co-defendants were convicted of sexually assaulting her over a period of nearly a decade after hed knocked her unconscious by lacing her food and drink with drugs. The other co-defendant was convicted of drugging and raping his own wife with Dominique Pelicots help.\n\nAs campaigners against sexual violence protested outside the courthouse, the 72-year-old Gisle Pelicot expressed my profound gratitude towards the people who supported me.\n\nYour messages moved me deeply, and they gave me the strength to come back, every day, and survive through these long daily hearings, she said. This trial was a very difficult ordeal.\n\nPelicot a hero to many in Franceand beyond for courageously demanding that all the evidence be heard in open court  also said she was thinking of her grandchildren after enduring the more than three-month trial, where she sat in the same courtroom as her attackers.\n\nIts also for them that I led this fight, she said of her grandkids. I wanted all of society to be a witness to the debates that took place here. I never regretted making this decision. I have trust in our capacity to collectively project ourselves toward a future where all, women and men, can live in harmony, with respect and mutual understanding. Thank you.\n\nThe court found Dominique Pelicot guilty on all charges and sentenced him to 20 years in prison, which was the maximum possible. At age 72, he could spend the rest of his life behind bars. He wont be eligible to request early release until hes served at least two-thirds of the sentence.\n\nDominique Pelicot and the other defendants stood up, one after the other, as chief judge Roger Arata read out the verdicts and sentences, which took more than an hour.\n\nGisle Pelicot sometimes nodded her head as verdicts were announced.\n\nDominique Pelicots lawyer, Batrice Zavarro, said she would consider an appeal, but she also expressed hope that Gisle Pelicot would find solace in the rulings.\n\nI wanted Mrs. Pelicot to be able to emerge from these hearings in peace, and I think that the verdicts will contribute to this relief for Mrs. Pelicot, she said.\n\nOf the 50 accused of rape, just one was acquitted but was instead convicted of aggravated sexual assault. Another man was also found guilty of the sexual assault charge he was tried for  producing 51 guilty verdicts in all.\n\nIn a side room where defendants family members watched the proceedings on television screens, some burst into tears and gasped as sentences were revealed.\n\nProtesters outside the courthouse followed the developments on their phones. Some read out the verdicts and applauded as they were announced inside. But disquiet grew as many of the sentences were lower than campaigners had hoped for, and cries of shame on the justice system! rose up from the crowd.\n\nIn addition tothe 20 years they sought for Dominique Pelicot, prosecutors asked for sentences of 10 to 18 years for the others charged with rape. But the court was more lenient, with many defendants getting less than a decade in prison. The five judges voted by secret ballot, by majority for the convictions and sentences.\n\nFor the defendants other than Dominique Pelicot, sentences ranged from three to 15 years imprisonment, with some of the time suspended for some of them. Arata told six defendants they were now free, accounting for time already spent in pretrial detention.\n\nSophie Burtin, 53, who traveled from Lyon to show support for Gisle Pelicot, said the trial brought the subject of rape out into open but expressed disappointment that the sentences arent at all exemplary.\n\nSome men will think, OK, its alright, what they did wasnt really a rape, she said. The message thats sent is, Is it really serious?  with sentences that are so light. For me, It was meant to be a historic trial, but the feeling I have is that history hasnt been made.\n\nGisle Pelicots courage duringthe bruising trialand her appalling ordeal, inflicted on the retired power company worker in what she had thought was a loving marriage, galvanized campaigners and spurred calls for tougher measures to stamp out rape culture.\n\nShe waived her right to anonymity as a survivor of sexual abuse and successfully pushed for the hearings and shocking evidence  including her ex-husbands homemade videos of the rapes  to be heard in open court, insisting that shame should fall on her abusers, not her.\n\nThe hearingsfueled conversations on a national level in Franceand among families, couples and friends about how to better protect women and the role that men can play.\n\nMen are starting to talk to women  their girlfriends, mothers and friends  in ways they hadnt before, said Fanny Foures, 48, who joined other women in gluing messages of support for Gisle Pelicot on walls around Avignon before the verdict.\n\nIt was awkward at first, but now real dialogues are happening, she said.\n\nSome women are realizing, maybe for the first time, that their ex-husbands violated them, or that someone close to them committed abuse, Foures added. And men are starting to reckon with their own behavior or complicity  things theyve ignored or failed to act on. Its heavy, but its creating change.\n\nA banner that campaigners hung on a city wall opposite the courthouse read, MERCI GISELE  thank you Gisle.\n\nThe defendants  strangers Dominique Pelicot recruited online  were all accused of having taken part in hissordid rape and abuse fantasiesthat he acted out with them and filmed in the couples retirement home in the small Provence town of Mazan and elsewhere.\n\nHe first came to the attention of police in September 2020 when a supermarket security guard caught him surreptitiously filming up womens skirts.\n\nPolice subsequently found his library of images documenting years of abuse  more than 20,000 photos and videos in all, stored on computer drives and catalogued in folders marked abuse, her rapists, night alone and other titles.\n\nThe abundant evidence led police to the other defendants. In the videos, investigators counted 72 different abusers but werent able to identify them all.\n\nAlthough some of the accused  including Dominique Pelicot  acknowledged that they were guilty of rape, many didnt.\n\nSome argued that Dominique Pelicots consent covered his wife, too. Some insisted that they hadnt intended to rape anyone when they responded to the husbands invitations to come to their home. Some laid blame at his door, saying he misled them into thinking they were taking part in consensual kink.\n\n",

            "content": "Rolling Stone\n\nLiam Paynes drug usage brought him close todeath multiple times months before hisfatal fallin October, according to his friend Roger Nores.\n\nIn a 91-page filing obtained byRolling StoneThursday, Nores  who is accused of abandonment followed by death  described the alleged depth of Paynes drug abuse, which he claims led to several hospitalizations, multiple rehab center visits, and two resuscitations in just the last two years.\n\nLast week, a judge called for an indagatoria, which requires suspects in a case to be questioned as part of the investigation. Suspects are not required to respond to questioning, and can submit written responses, as Nores did Wednesday. It is not a deposition. The document  which includes Nores version of events, and screenshots of conversations with people close to the former One Direction member  was filed by Nores to support his defense to the charge of abandonment of a person, followed by death.\n\nI was a friend who loved him very much, who helped him selflessly in everything I could, who spent my own money to help him, and even then it was not enough, writes Nores in Spanish in the document obtained byRolling Stone. I do not consider that I deserve the accusation that is being leveled at me.\n\nIn the filing, Nores claims that Payne was in and out of rehabilitation centers in Europe and the United States in the months leading up to his death, that he consumed heroin, and that his usage of substances nearly killed him several times.\n\nIn one instance, in September 2023, Nores alleges that Payne suffered from a severe intoxication that left him close to death, and that he was hospitalized for three days in Milan. He claims that at the time, Payne was forced to cancel a Latin American tour because of the incident and his subsequent visit to a rehab center. (Payne had canceled the tour that August due to a bad kidney infection.)\n\nBecause of his addictions, Payne continued to attend rehab centers of his own free will in an attempt to overcome them, the statement contends. Unfortunately, these treatments were not successful and his addiction worsened as he began to use harder drugs, such as heroin.\n\nNores claims that Payne was hospitalized twice again in London in late 2023, and was taken to a hospital in an ambulance due to his high levels of intoxication, where he had to be resuscitated. Professionals had to resort to resuscitation maneuvers to save his life, without his family or friends being able to do anything to avoid these situations or help him, Nores alleges.\n\nNores claims that Paynes drug issues continued to worsen at the beginning of 2024, and that Payne entered a rehabilitation facility in Spain in March. Payne left the rehab center before completing treatment and returned to consuming drugs, Nores claims.Payne then allegedly had to be resuscitated again following a near overdose the following month.\n\nLiam suffered a new relapse in his addiction, so he was again taken to the hospital in serious condition, and the professionals had to resort to resuscitation maneuvers to save his life, Nores claims. He further alleges that after this incident, Paynes father attempted to admit him to a psychiatric treatment center, but that Payne opposed the idea.\n\nSince he was not legally required to stay there, Payne checked himself out of the hospital and returned to the United States to seek help for his drug addiction, Nores claims. The filing contends that Paynes family and friends allowed him to do drugs the day before he left for the States to avoid that he become violent. (The document does not specify the exact timeline of his return to the United States.\n\nNores maintains that Payne did not consume drugs that summer, including during a trip to Argentina when Payne went to a Louis Tomlinson show in South America. However, by the start of August, Nores claims that he and Payne had a strong argument where he discouraged Payne from returning to Manchester, England, because Nores could tell that Payne had started using drugs again.\n\nIn an Aug. 23 email obtained byRolling Stone, Nores writes to Paynes attorney and father Geoff that he is really concerned for his well-being in the United Kingdom. I hope you can bring professional doctors to check on his health regularly as soon as possible as I did while he was out in the US, Nores wrote. I am going to stay fully out of the picture and disconnected from now on and I wish you all the best with Liams health and career.\n\nReps for Paynes family in Argentina and the United Kingdom did not immediately respond toRolling Stones request for comment on Nores filing. Nores did not comment.\n\nNores abandonment followed by death charge accuses him of leaving Payne while knowing that he was unable to care for himself and/or that he wasnt in his right mind. For said charge, Nores could face five to 15 years in prison. In Wednesdays filing, Nores maintains that he was not his doctor, lawyer, or representative, and claims that when he left Payne at the hotel the day he died, he was greeting fans and seemed to be fine. (Hetold TMZthat he was playful and in good spirits.)\n\nIn the document, Nores pivots blame to the hotel staff for carrying Paynes body to his room where there was more of a risk of death. According to a 911 call, the reception head claimed the musician had been breaking everything in his room prior to the fatal fall. If Liam had not been brought into the room by force, and had been left in the lobby and a doctor had been called while they saw him convulsing, none of this would have happened, reads the filing.\n\nAlong with Nores, the other four people charged in the case responded to indagatorias. Next, the judge must determine whether the defendants should be further prosecuted, dropped from the case, or if there isnt evidentiary support for either decision.\n\nPayne died at the age of 31of multiple traumas and internal bleeding after falling from the third-floor balcony of the CasaSur Palermo hotelon Oct. 16. In November, prosecutors identifiedalcohol, cocaine, and a prescribed antidepressantin Paynes system at the time of his death, according to a toxicology report. Many questions still loom about what led to his death.\n\nOn Saturday, Paynesfans held a marchin Buenos Aires calling for significant and timely advances in the investigation. The gathering spawned after an image leaked online, which appeared to show Payne being carried by three hotel workers back to his room, allegedly mere minutes before he fell.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nLEADING retailer, OK Zimbabwe says the 2025 National Budget is set to increase business costs inthe coming yearworsening an alreadytough operating environment.\n\nThe National Budget blueprint delivered by Prof Mthuli Ncube last month introduced a cocktail of new taxation measures, triggering an outcry from industry which Parliament is already seized with.\n\nChief among the concerns is that the tax measures are repetitive and exerting more pressure on the highly taxed narrow formal sector while effectively leaving the informal sector.\n\nSome have raised concerns that the new tax measures were imposed repetitively on the same value chain thereby pushing up the cost of production and depleting export competitiveness.\n\nSo tax thirsty is the National Budget blueprint to the extent that it has gone after betting game winners who are now forced to surrender a portion of their earnings to the taxman.\n\nAdding a voice of concern, OK Zimbabwe chairman Herbert Nkala said the year ahead will increase the cost of doing business significantly.\n\nThe tax proposals in the 2025 budget statement are likely to drive up costs and lower margins realized on affected product lines such as alcoholic and deli products. Going into the second half of the trading year, cost optimisation and product diversification will remain key priorities in sustaining and enhancing the growth achieved during the period under review, he said.\n\nDespite the challenges in the trading environment during the half-year period, the Group realised growth in both sales volumes and revenues.\n\nSales volumes went up by 27.69% as compared to the prior period while the gross profit margin improved from 16.83% in the prior period to 19.64% in the current period.\n\nThe growth in volume was bolstered by a successful OK Grand Challenge promotion which included the OK Mart stores for the first time which resulted in growth in the contribution of bulk sales compared to the prior period.\n\nOther expenses went up by 16,29% from US$17,3 million in the prior period to US$20,17 million in the current period largely due to the increased cost of energy supply which went up from USD5 million in the prior year to US$8,2 million.\n\n",
