            "content": "By Xinhua\n\nZIMBABWE Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube on Friday raised the countrys growth projection to 6.6 percent this year, up from the initial forecast of 6 percent, owing to a larger tobacco output and surging global gold prices.\n\nThe higher projection is on account of more than anticipated output in the agricultural sector, particularly tobacco, following favorable climatic conditions and mining sector growth buoyed by high commodity prices, notably gold, Ncube said at a business conference in Bulawayo, the second largest city in Zimbabwe.Tobacco and gold are Zimbabwes largest agricultural and mineral exports, serving as major foreign currency earners for the southern African country.Ncube noted that despite global headwinds and exogenous shocks, including climate change, commodity price fluctuations, and energy supply constraints, Zimbabwes economy remains resilient.In 2025 and beyond, our economy is poised for a strong recovery and sustained growth following the drought-induced slowdown we experienced in 2024.

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nAS Zimbabwe commemorates the International Day of Peace today, September 21, a human rights watchdog, the Zimbabwe Peace Project (ZPP), has called upon political parties across the spectrum to prioritise policies that safeguard human rights and deliver essential services.\n\nIn a statement this Saturday, ZPP said when citizens notice equitable distribution of resources, functioning social services, and policies that uphold dignity, they are more inclined to build peace among themselves and extend it to others.The call comes as the the country continues to grapple with threats to peace in the form of persistent human rights violations.ZPP said peace will flourish when citizens are empowered, livelihoods secured, and communities benefit tangibly from national resources, where this would nurture social cohesion, an ideal which is already envisioned in National Development Strategies (NDS).In a country where the populace is losing social benefits such as pensions, citizens have felt neglected, fuelling tensions in almost all sectors.ZPP warned that failure to have protection of socio-economic rights will result in political promises ringing hollow, triggering frustration and disillusionment.The peace threats were said to be more prominent during politically sensitive periods, where violence, intimidation, and exclusionary tactics expose the fragility of peace at a time when collective tolerance is most needed.Upholding non-violence, fairness, and transparency in all the enjoyment of socio-economic rights is central to peace.A hungry, unemployed, and excluded population cannot be expected to prioritise peace when survival itself is at stake, ZPP said.According to the ZPP, peace is not built on slogans but on peoples lived experiences.On this International Day of Peace, ZPP urges every Zimbabwean, leaders, institutions, civil society, and communities, to recommit to peace, not only in words but in action. Together, we can reimagine and realise a Zimbabwe where peace is not fragile but firm, not conditional but guaranteed, and not postponed but lived every day.This year alone, ZPP has documented 891 human rights violations, and these have affected over 38,400 people across provinces (38,417 people affected, 20,627 women, 17,790 men with 553 PWDs), added ZPP.ZPP called for concrete and collective action to the civil society and Community-Based Organisations to deepen grassroots peace-building, document violations, and hold duty-bearers accountable while fostering inclusive dialogue across divides.Political parties must put the nation above partisan interests; uphold non-violence, fairness, and transparency in all political processes to state institutions.Independent commissions should strengthen accountability mechanisms, protect rights without fear or favour, and build trust with citizens.To the international community, ZPP urged support to Zimbabwes peace-building initiatives with technical, diplomatic, and financial assistance, ensuring that human rights and socio-economic justice remain central to development partnerships.Peace is not an abstract dream; it is the practical outcome of justice, fairness, and accountability. It thrives when leaders are sincere, when institutions serve impartially, and when communities are empowered to prosper.\n\nIn a statement this Saturday, ZPP said when citizens notice equitable distribution of resources, functioning social services, and policies that uphold dignity, they are more inclined to build peace among themselves and extend it to others.\n\nThe call comes as the the country continues to grapple with threats to peace in the form of persistent human rights violations.ZPP said peace will flourish when citizens are empowered, livelihoods secured, and communities benefit tangibly from national resources, where this would nurture social cohesion, an ideal which is already envisioned in National Development Strategies (NDS).In a country where the populace is losing social benefits such as pensions, citizens have felt neglected, fuelling tensions in almost all sectors.ZPP warned that failure to have protection of socio-economic rights will result in political promises ringing hollow, triggering frustration and disillusionment.The peace threats were said to be more prominent during politically sensitive periods, where violence, intimidation, and exclusionary tactics expose the fragility of peace at a time when collective tolerance is most needed.Upholding non-violence, fairness, and transparency in all the enjoyment of socio-economic rights is central to peace.A hungry, unemployed, and excluded population cannot be expected to prioritise peace when survival itself is at stake, ZPP said.According to the ZPP, peace is not built on slogans but on peoples lived experiences.On this International Day of Peace, ZPP urges every Zimbabwean, leaders, institutions, civil society, and communities, to recommit to peace, not only in words but in action.

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE 14th edition of the Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba ended on a high note Friday with key stakeholders seizing the Mines and Minerals Development Bill as a golden opportunity to end rampant injustices bedeviling the nation.\n\nDespite the Southern Africa nation being endowed with a cocktail of precious minerals, the majority of the populace generally feels that very little benefits from the extractive sector have been of benefit to them.While millions worth of minerals are siphoned from the country, villagers have endured environmental destruction, broken infrastructure and dust inhaling related diseases with no resources to solve the problems.The gazetting of the Mines and Minerals Bill in June this year presented a window of hope to millions of citizens, who have endured decades of being sidelined under the colonial eras Mines Act.But at the 2025 Environmental Social Governance Conference hosted by Silveira House and the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Organisation (ZELO) during the ZAMI, several participants implored the government to expeditiously address all the problems bedeviling the mining sector through the Bill.Silveira House programmes manager, Dr Alois Madhekeni said his organisation as a faith based entity believes in the promulgation of legislation, which places human dignity at the core.That principle is expected to determine the manner in which both corporations and the government conduct their operations. So, in this case as corporations rush into the mining sector, the question is how is the dignity of the human person and that of communities being protected?He emphasised that mining should not leave the communities worse off economically, socially, health-wise, technologically and culturally as he implored the adoption of a rights-based perspective to mining.If we see these values embedded in the Minerals Amendment Bill, then we will be happy. Our role now as Silveira House is to ensure that communities have access to the document, they analyse it and are geared to adequately provide input, added Madhekeni.ZELO emphasised on the need to put in place a strong legal infrastructure as the gateway to sustainable mining activities across the country.The Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC) implored the government and corporates to be guided by the Biblical guidance, which talks about Godly fairness in enjoying the earth and its gifted abundance.However, the Mines and Mining Development Deputy Minister, Polite Kambamura said gazetting of the MMB is a gesture by the government to engage citizens on the contentious matter.It is a show by the government on its commitment to transparency and inclusivity, leaving no one behind. The Bill was prepared to enhance Zimbabwe as a friendly investment destination, which is investor ready .To make sure that community challenges are dealt with once and for all we brought sustainability into the Bill, he said.Kambamura added that the legal instrument responds to the ever-changing global and local environment. It will open up room for the drafting of the mining policy and cover all the issues which speak to mining.\n\nDespite the Southern Africa nation being endowed with a cocktail of precious minerals, the majority of the populace generally feels that very little benefits from the extractive sector have been of benefit to them.\n\nWhile millions worth of minerals are siphoned from the country, villagers have endured environmental destruction, broken infrastructure and dust inhaling related diseases with no resources to solve the problems.The gazetting of the Mines and Minerals Bill in June this year presented a window of hope to millions of citizens, who have endured decades of being sidelined under the colonial eras Mines Act.But at the 2025 Environmental Social Governance Conference hosted by Silveira House and the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Organisation (ZELO) during the ZAMI, several participants implored the government to expeditiously address all the problems bedeviling the mining sector through the Bill.Silveira House programmes manager, Dr Alois Madhekeni said his organisation as a faith based entity believes in the promulgation of legislation, which places human dignity at the core.That principle is expected to determine the manner in which both corporations and the government conduct their operations.

Our country Zimbabwe is, indeed, on a reversible journey towards vision 2030.\n\nThis modern infrastructure serves as a source of pride for the veterans of the liberation struggle, who fought so that all our people can have a higher quality of life, he said.\n\nThe project will provide 300 residential flats and 750 student apartments.\n\nThe project also provided over 3 000 job opportunities benefiting members of the Zvishavane community and others.\n\nThe local community also benefitted from upgraded water and sanitary systems as well as improved road networks following the introduction of the project.\n\nWork resumed in March last year and has been completed.\n\nMnangangwa said project is a symbol of national unity and progress, adding his government will continue pushing towards achieving such high-quality projects countrywide.\n\nThis is the standard and work we must uphold across all our entities.The residential flats are investments in the dignity of our people through quality living space.\n\nMnangagwa also said the success of this project demonstrates the power of private public partnerships, further applauding the PSPF and its partners.\n\nFirst Mutual Wealth provided the land, while the majority of the capital, approximately 97%, was invested by the PSPF, with First Mutual acting as project manager, according to Douglas Hoto, chairman and group chief executive officer of First Mutual Holdings.\n\n",
