They accuse the Zanu-PF leader of overseeing rampant corruption and nepotism, and of plotting to extend his term beyond the constitutionally mandated limit.\n\nGeza also turned his fire on the First Lady, Auxilia Mnangagwa, accusing her of wasting state resources on what he deems unnecessary tours around the country.\n\nConstitutional experts such as Professor Lovemore Madhuku have long maintained that such a term extension is legally impossible.\n\nWhile Mnangagwa himself has publicly pledged to step down at the end of his term in 2028, critics warn that this is simply his modus operandi  giving the impression of heading one way while veering sharply in another.\n\nThey point to his continued silence on the matter, failing to quash those who advocate for a term extension, as further evidence.\n\nMnangagwas term concludes in 2028, yet some of his allies and party members persist in calling for him to remain in power until 2030.\n\nGeza, a Zanu-PF Central Committee member, delivered his most recent press conference on Monday, urging Zimbabweans to prepare for a national shutdown as calls for Mnangagwas resignation grow louder, the tide is turning with the public.\n\nWe implore you to resign peacefully. If you dont resign in peace, people will use the constitution to exercise their right to push you out of office, Geza said.\n\nGeza also warned the police that if they dared to beat or shoot demonstrators protesting against Mnangagwa, the public would hold them accountable in their own neighbourhoods.\n\nIn response, police spokesperson Commissioner Paul Nyathi issued a statement on Wednesday, asserting that Geza faces charges of insulting Mnangagwa and inciting public violence.\n\nTheft allegations as defined in Section 113 of the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act, Chapter 9: 23. The suspect stole and disposed of three vehicles belonging to a complainant without his consent.\n\nHe is also facing two counts of contravening Section 33 (2) (a) (ii) of the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act, Chapter 9: 23, Undermining the Authority of or insulting the President,' Nyathis statement reads.\n\nCommissioner Nyathi further stated that Geza had incited the public to commit violence, violating the Criminal Code and Reform Act.\n\nOne count of contravening Section 187 of the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act, Chapter 9:23, Incitement to commit public violence, Nyathi said.\n\nNyathi also cautioned that anyone found harbouring Geza or assisting him in evading police questioning would be equally liable for arrest and prosecution.\n\n",

So now we cannot go in because of church? We are within!\n\nThe idea of exposing pastors  trusted figures in religious communities  has sparked mixed reactions.\n\nFor those who might be unfamiliar with the show, Uyajola 9/9 is South Africas answer to the Cheaters franchise, with a distinctly local twist.\n\nIn each episode, Jub Jub and his team track down people suspected of cheating, confronting them with evidence.\n\nThe show has become known for its intense confrontations, high drama, and unpredictable outcomes, sometimes tearing families apart, other times resolving long-standing issues.\n\nNow, it seems the show is turning a critical eye toward the very institutions that are meant to guide and support moral values  churches.\n\nBy targeting pastors and religious figures, Jub Jub is challenging the belief that these spaces are beyond reproach when it comes tocheating.\n\nThe implications of exposing cheating in religious settings are complex. On one hand, its understandable why some viewers might see this as a necessary step towards transparency.\n\nIf pastors, who are often viewed as role models are coveting with thy neighbour, it raises concerns about their integrity and teachings.\n\nFor those in the congregation, the revelation could be a shock but also a wake-up call about the flaws that exist even in the most revered of spaces.\n\nHowever, theres also a more sensitive side to consider.\n\nThe church is often considered a sanctuary for people to find solace, guidance and community. By airing these personal conflicts on national TV, Uyajola 9/9 might risk eroding the trust people place in their religious leaders.\n\nSome viewers may feel that the show is exploiting sacred spaces for entertainment rather than truly serving the greater good.\n\nUyajola 9/9 is stirring up an important conversation  one about loyalty, accountability and the blurred lines between public and private life.\n\nShould religious leaders be held to a higher standard? Is it right to expose personal matters in such a public way? Or is this a wake-up call that theres no one immune to the temptations of infidelity, even in the holiest of spaces?\n\nSo many questions!\n\nJub Jub says he is also coming for cheating pastors in the next season of Uyajola99.pic.twitter.com/kyUbDcCFcr\n\n@nathit00th commented: Chief we are busy dealing with bigger issues in our country at the moment. we are repositioning south africa in the world and wena you are coming with petty issues of cheaters please dude chill. we will give you attention next year.\n\n@ModiegiLakes commented: They really need to just shut it. No longer relevant this uyajola 99 nonsense.\n\nWhile @r_motlatso wrote: Hes lying, last time he was promoting season 2 of this stupid show, he said hell be exposing celebrities who cheat. This show must be cancelled, and if you support  youre just as much as an idiot.\n\nSjoe, these people are not having it.\n\n",

We do not, in any way, want to see a Zimbabwe where the rights of the people are being eroded. In 2028, we expect to go to the polls.\n\nWe expect to have the opportunity to register our candidates and to elect a new president for Zimbabwe.

In 2017, we were presented with an opportunity for a new future. Now, we are hearing this new mantra saying we must keep the president in power because he is doing such a great job. This is why we are launching the Community Wall Initiative.

Data also indicates that the informal sector has cost Zimbabwe at least US$1,15 billion in potential fiscal revenue between 2020 and 2023.\n\nUnder this framework, vendors will be licensed by local authorities in consultation with the Central Government.\n\nSpeaking at the post-cabinet briefing Tuesday, Information Minister Jenfan Muswere said, Under short-term measures, the use of electronic money will now be compulsory for all businesses and shall be achieved through the introduction of a compulsory tax payment system to ensure that every eligible taxpayer pays tax and the establishment of a Domestic Inter-agency Team to ensure informal sector compliance with tax laws.\n\nThe government seeks to bring all businesses into the tax bracket and enhance the effectiveness of the foreign exchange market.\n\nIn the long-term, the government will address the business environment to streamline fees, and charges and minimize duplication of work by Government Agencies as well as improve electricity supply in a bid to enable MSMEs to graduate into formal businesses.\n\nThe Cabinet also agreed to expedite the construction of power plants and upgrading of the distribution network to enhance the availability of electricity, incentivise the use of alternative energy sources, and expedite social protection coverage to the informal sector.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nFINANCE and Investment Promotion Minister, Mthuli Ncube has announced the beginning of compensation payments to farmers under the US$20 million facility set aside in the 2024 National Budget.\n\nThe compensation exercise targets investors protected by the Bilateral Investment Protection and Promotion Agreements (BIPPAs) whose investments were affected by the Land Reform Program in 2000.\n\nThe claimants under the category are from Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Switzerland and former Yugoslavia.\n\nI am pleased to announce that the compensation process has begun. We believe that this process is crucial for building Trust, honoring commitments and ensuring consistency with our Constitution as we address Zimbabwes debt challenge.\n\nThe payments towards the compensation of investors under BIPPA Protection began in the second week of January 2025.Payments is being made to the claimants bank accounts of choice, said Ncube.\n\nThe envoys of Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland jointly welcomed the announcement describing it as a giant step bringing a sense of closure among the affected parties.\n\nThe framework established by the Government of Zimbabwe leading to the full compensation of affected BIPPA farmers protected by BIPPA Agreements is indeed a historic achievement. We commend the governments allocation of funds in the National Budget as of 2024 to make the compensation a reality.\n\nSeveral affected investors have received initial payouts, and an emerging sense of closure exists.It marks a significant milestone and we consider it a very encouraging step towards a comprehensive and fair settlement for farmers and investors in Zimbabwe, the ambassadors said in a statement.\n\nThe President of the African Development Bank (AfDB) and the champion of the Zimbabwe Arrears clearance and Debt resolution, Dr Akinwumi Adesina hailed the milestone achievement and implored more development partners to support the initiative.\n\nThe compensation demonstrates the governments goodwill and commitment to building trust in the process and improving in the country. The progress Zimbabwe has made, the commitment and resilience it is showing, calls for support from development partners to facilitate the countrys efforts in implementing ongoing reforms and to provide the much-needed cushion to particularly the vulnerable members of the population, he said.\n\nIn 2022, the Government of Zimbabwe established a Structured Dialogue Platform with all its creditors and development partners to institutionalize engagement on economic and governance reforms to underpin the Arrears clearance and Debt Resolution Process.\n\n",
