            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) has warned that while the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwes (RBZ) tight Monetary Policy Statement (MPS) has helped ease inflationary pressures, it has also significantly dampened demand.\n\nThe RBZ has maintained a restrictive monetary policy to stabilise prices, the exchange rate, and the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency. Current measures include a high policy rate of 35%, a statutory reserve requirement of 15% for savings and time deposits, and 30% for demand and call deposits.\n\nThe policy framework is designed to support the ZiG, which was introduced to restore confidence and stability in the economy. The central bank has been working to maintain the currencys stability against the US dollar.\n\nIn its latest inflation tracker, CZI noted that while the fall in inflation confirms the effectiveness of the current monetary stance in stabilising prices, the downside has been a steep decline in aggregate demand.\n\nWhile tight liquidity is helping stabilise prices, it also has negative implications on demand and hence business output and growth. Therefore, in the long term, monetary policy has to ease tight liquidity conditions as stability becomes sustainable, the industry grouping said.\n\nCZI said keeping inflation below 1% enhances price stability and goes a long way in broadening the use of ZiG beyond a transaction currency, while acknowledging that businesses that previously preferred to trade in USD transactions only are beginning to slowly encourage ZiG payments to help them settle some of their monthly obligations.\n\nThe industry grouping said the high annual inflation rate of 93,8% is still reflective of the September 2024 devaluation of ZiG, hence will only ease in October, provided there is no other shock in the inflation drivers to cause high month-on-month inflation.\n\nIn comparison, the US$ prices remained the same between July and August 2025 as the main driver of USD inflation (S.I. 81A of 2024) was repelled in early 2025. Some of the possible signals to be derived from the stable USD prices include greater predictability in input and output costs for businesses that largely operate in US$.\n\nThe industry grouping warned that the gap between the official and parallel market rates could motivate traders to abandon the formal market.\n\n",

            "content": "Metro UKs foreign correspondent Gergana Krasteva reports from Zimbabwe\n\nThe last time I see Madeline Mgwabi, she is peering through the gates of her crumbling home in western Zimbabwe.\n\nThe grandmother-of-three is clutching a single orange that our driver had slipped to her  leftover from the hotel breakfast.\n\nThe fruit will have to be split four ways between her and her grandsons one of them still a toddler  all of whom she is raising on her own in this godforsaken area in the southern part of Matabeleland North province.\n\nBeside her, on a wooden bench, is her eldest grandson, still dressed in his purple and blueschooluniform, steadily scooping gooey porridge from a plastic container.\n\nTo put food on the table, Madeline fetches firewood and does odd jobs for neighbours in the village of Libeni, in Umguza District, but it is not enough.\n\nBefore droughts robbed the region of water, the grandmother used to farm maize and other Zimbabwean staple crops in her now barren garden.\n\nGesturing at the dried-up shrubs, she tellsMetro: I have lived here for 25 years and each year, the droughts hit us worse and worse.\n\nBecause of the climate, we often do not harvest anything.\n\nHer face is hollowed by the years of loss, and her palms are calloused by the decade of grinding in Zimbabwes artisanal mines.\n\nWhat Madeline fears is that her grandsons will eventually have to abandon education in favour of mining to earn a living.\n\nThe familys financial struggle resembles the one of millions of people who have been burdened by the decades of macroeconomic instability, political isolation and now,climate changein Zimbabwe.\n\nDriving through Matabeleland North  where agricultureused to be one of the key economic sectors Metrowitnesses the scars of theclimate warming cycle, El Nio, firsthand.\n\nHere, the earth appears to have forgotten whatrainfeels like, despite the determination of Zimbabweans to revive what has been lost.\n\nAlongside the road, cattle search for anything to eat  grass, shrubs, any bit of greenery left in a land that has surrendered.\n\nThe SUV rumbles past what the driver tells me was, until 2023, the mighty Shangani River that used to nourish the region; now, it is nothing more than a cracked bed of mud and rocks.\n\nLast year, the Zimbabwean president Emmerson Mnangagwa declared a national disaster to tackle the prolonged drought crisis.\n\nLesotho, Malawi, Namibia and Zambia did so too. Other African nations were also severely affected.\n\nAs most households depend on agriculture for food, seven million people in Zimbabwe faced big shortagesduring the 2024-2025 season, despite improved crops this year.\n\nChildren have been the most impacted by the droughts  with some opting to drop out of school because their parents cannot provide them with food.\n\nA fifth of all Zimbabwean children aged less than five suffer from chronic malnutrition, with merely 10% of babies aged six to 23 months receiving an adequate minimum diet, according to recent figures.\n\nHunger is only one part of a vicious cycle that children are trapped in. With households collapsing under the weight of poverty, boys as young as nine leave school to risk their lives in unregulated mines  and girls are married off to provide their parents a brief financial relief.\n\nInZimbabwe, one girlout of three isalready marriedbefore turning 18, and more than one out of five has given birth.\n\nScores of underage brides fall victim to domestic violence and face gravehealthrisks, from early childbearing to HIV.\n\nAlthoughunderage marriage is illegalin Zimbabwe and local organisations have been fighting against it, families driven by poverty resort to it.\n\nLungisani Nyathi knows all too well the dangers his four children face; yet with no steadyworkand no wages coming in, he feels powerless to shield them.\n\nGesturing at a makeshift shack, clumsily constructed out of wood and blue tarpaulin, that is his new home, he tellsMetrothat his wife gave birth just 10 months ago to their baby girl.\n\nAs a father, I am supposed to provide for my children, he shares his fears.\n\nIf I fail to provide for my daughter when she grows up, I worry that she will have to marry someone very young.\n\nIt is common for girls to be tied into early marriages due to the financial situation of their families.\n\nOne day, our baby girl will have to face the same situation. Young girls are so desperate, they go to bars themselves to search for money.\n\nLungisani, who volunteers as a security guard for a borehole that supplies water in Village 5, in Bubi District, wishes to relocate his wife and children to another area so that his boys are not tempted to work in the gold mines nearby.\n\nWherever schools are located near mining fields, boys are sometimes lured into the pit, under the promise of some money.\n\nAfter working in a gold mine for six months last year, Lungisani knows all too well that this is not the life for a child.\n\nDescribing the conditions as very harsh, because workers are not given any protective clothing, he adds: Even the dust was choking us.\n\nKhumalo Fanta, deputy headteacher at the Amazwimabili Primary School, shares similar fears for her pupils and says that every year, a few children drop out to work in the mines or to be married off.\n\nShe tellsMetrothat boys, not even in their teens, who work as miners, are swiftly swept into a world of alcohol abuse, without parental supervision.\n\nWith what little money they make, they often entice young girls with false promises of a better life  pulling them both into the same cycle of poverty they were trying to escape, before their lives have even started.\n\nKhumalo says: A lot of boys would leave school and go work at the mines. It exposes them to elicit behaviour There is always alcohol near the mines because it sells fast to adolescents.\n\nThere is no control as parents are simply grateful that money is coming home, but it is dangerous.\n\nIt is a ticking time bomb. When they come back, they flash their money and the girls are attracted.\n\nThen they are lost in their behaviour because those boys just get drunk, shouting, they do all sorts of things.\n\nIf children go to school at all, the absence of support systems means that they walk several miles on empty stomachs every morning.\n\nMarys Meals, a Scottish-basedcharity, is working to break that cycle by providing daily school meals for children in early education.\n\nThe concept is simple. Marys Meals provides food for school, but it is the parents  often the mothers of the pupils  who prepare it and serve it up in between classes.\n\nThe promise of a warm bowl of porridge a day has become a lifeline, and sometimes the only meal a child will be guaranteed.\n\nMadelines eldest grandson, for example, is one of the pupils part of the programme.\n\nShe says: There is nothing more important for my grandsons than going to school and having an education. So having porridge at school is so helpful as it reduces the workload for me.\n\nDromoland Primary, the Bubi District of Matabeleland North, is one of the schools with which Marys Meals has been working with.\n\nSimeleni Mguni, the headmaster since 2020, toldMetrothat at the end of last year, there were 255 pupils  but this year there are 279 because of the feeding programme.\n\nWe enroll new learners every week, she says beaming with pride, her smile stretching across her round face.\n\nBefore the programme was introduced at the beginning of the school term in 2022, four boys and four girls dropped out because their parents could not feed them.\n\nSimeleni says, regretfully: I know some of the left because they needed to find jobs. Almost all the boys  aged between 12 and 14  went to search for work in the illegal mines.\n\nFor awhile, they moved from one gold mine to another, in the nearby area. It is not easy work. If they would find any gold they have to sell it for really meagre amounts of money [as it is not from a registered pit].\n\nTwo years later, they are now back in school because of Marys Meals, and passed their exams recently.\n\nThe four girls  aged between 13 and 14  are also back in the classroom.\n\nSimeleni said they had left because they did not have period products and were embarrassed to come to school.\n\nMarys Meals has been operating in Zimbabwe since 2018, with the help of a grassroots-based NGO, ORAP.\n\nWorking in some of the poorest countries across Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Latin America and the Caribbean, the charity has today announced the grim milestone that it is feeding three million children every day.\n\nMetro travelled to Zimbabwe with the help ofMarys Meals, a Scottish-based charity feeding children in the country.\n\n",

This will only deepen poverty, running contrary to the SDGs, particularly the goal of eradicating poverty, as well as the objectives of NDS1, which seeks to reduce the cost of doing business, Tsvangirayi said.\n\nNorton MP Richard Tsvangirayi\n\nHe also urged ZIMRA to pursue incentive-based strategies to boost compliance instead of punitive measures that threaten livelihoods.\n\nWhile the intention may be to encourage companies to register, formalise their operations, and increase government revenue, alternative strategies must be pursued.\n\nThese strategies should focus on incentivising compliance rather than relying on punitive measures that exacerbate the economic hardships already faced by ordinary citizens. In this regard, ZIMRA must urgently revise these figures downwards to ensure fairness and protect livelihoods.\n\n",

On arrival, they discovered the mans body with multiple injuries, believed to have been inflicted with stones and bottles. Paramedics declared him dead at the scene.\n\nColonel Malesela Ledwaba, the provincial police spokesperson, confirmed that the motive for the killing is still under investigation and appealed for the publics help.\n\nWe are treating this as a serious case of mob justice and are appealing to community members with any information to come forward, said Ledwaba.\n\nThe circumstances around the mans death are still unknown, and we urge anyone who can assist in tracing his next of kin or can provide information that leads to the arrest of the suspects to contact the police immediately.\n\nAnyone with information is urged to contact Detective Sergeant Mmatlou Nkoana at 082 716 8075, the Crime Stop number 08600 10111, the nearest police station, or use the My SAPS App, he said.\n\nIn another case,a 34-year-old woman is expected to appear before the Malamulele Magistrates Court on Tuesday, following her arrest in connection with a mob-justice incident at Mphakati village under the Saselamani policing area.\n\nColonel Ledwaba said the horrific murder incident occurred on Sunday morning.\n\nPolice were conducting patrol duties when they were informed about members of the community who were busy assaulting a male victim at the village. They reacted swiftly and rushed to the vicinity and found a male victim lying in the middle of the road with severe injuries on his body, said Ledwaba.\n\nEmergency medical services were summoned, and he was declared dead on arrival at the scene.\n\nPreliminary investigations revealed that the deceased was forcefully dragged from his residence by a mob who accused him of stealing a laptop from a nearby house, said Ledwaba.\n\nPolice said the arrested woman was positively identified as one of the participants in the brutal attack.

The country is a land of wild beauty and rich history. Think rocky granite outcrops rising above golden plains, acacia trees swaying under endless skies, and ancient ruins that whisper stories of the past.\n\nAt Great Zimbabwe, those iconic stone walls still stand strong, a reminder of centuries of civilisation.\n\nOver at Victoria Falls, the mighty Zambezi crashes down so hard it throws up mist that often catches the sun in fleeting rainbows.. And if youre after something calmer, the Eastern Highlands bring misty mountains, winding trails, and a kind of peace you didnt know you needed.\n\nWhy its on the radar: Zimbabwes cities are drawing fresh interest: flight searches to Bulawayo have jumped more than 80% on Kayak, while Harare has seen a 56% rise for summer travel this year.\n\nMorocco comes in 6th on the list, making it the second African country to feature. The country offers a blend of desert magic, mountain drama, and vibrant city life. Out in the Sahara, youve got endless red dunes under silent skies.\n\nThe Atlas Mountains rise tall with snowy peaks, and down in the valleys, olive and argan groves scatter the hills. In Fez, the medina is a maze of narrow alleys, tiled courtyards, and the unforgettable smell of leather dyeing.\n\nMarrakech is a whole vibelantern-lit rooftops, busy souks, metalworkers hammering away, and sunset views over minarets. By the coast, Essaouira serves up salty sea winds and seagulls circling its blue-shuttered houses. And for the dreamiest scene of all, Chefchaouens blue-painted streets wind up toward the Rif Mountains.\n\nEarlier this year, Morocco emerged as Africas most visited destination, attracting17.4 million visitors in 2024, according to its Ministry of Tourism.\n\nWhy its on the radar: Marrakech stands out as one of the best-value long-haul destinations with flight prices down 5% compared to summer last year on Kayak.\n\n",

I take the view that indeed there is evidence before the court, the judge said.\n\nWairo is charged with murder under section 47(1) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act. Prosecutors allege that on 23 December 2023, Wairo and three accomplices assaulted Sengai with open hands and fists, causing head injuries from which he later died.\n\nKey witness Noleen Goro, who once dated the accused, told the court she saw Wairo slapping Sengai so hard he fell to the ground while others dragged him by his shirt. She later called a passerby, Tafadzwa Paundi, to help the victim.\n\nDefence lawyers attacked Goros credibility, calling her a self-confessed alcoholic, but the judge found her testimony consistent with that of the investigating officer and Paundi. Calling her names does not detract from her testimony, which is consistent, Mandaza J ruled.\n\nThe judge stressed that at this stage the State was only required to show a prima facie case, not proof beyond reasonable doubt. Once a prima facie case has been established, the evidential burden will shift to the accused to adduce evidence in order to escape conviction, he said.\n\nThe trial will now proceed to the defence case, with Wairo expected to answer to the murder charge.\n\n",

            "content": "By Tapiwa Svondo\n\nBaba Harare has returned to his Jiti roots, abandoning the gospel path he had pursued for the past year.\n\nThe musician, who a year ago stunned fans by announcing his decision to leave secular music for gospel, revealed the disrespect and exploitation he faced within the gospel industry. He accused some church event organisers of refusing to pay artists after performances.\n\nIn a Facebook post, Baba Harare, who had rebranded himself asKing Davidduring his gospel stint, said many promoters expect gospel musicians to perform for free, arguing that payment shouldnt matter because its for the Kingdom.\n\nIve been blessed to experience both worlds the secular stage and the gospel stage. From a ministerial perspective, gospel concerts are powerful. They spread the Word, they win souls, and they glorify God. But from a business perspective, its a different story.\n\nOften, people hide under the idea that because youre ministering for the Kingdom, payment shouldnt matter. But lets be honest: I am not only a Christian, I am also a human being and an artist. This is my work, my livelihood, and I need to survive beyond the stage, wrote Baba Harare.\n\nHe warned upcoming musicians not to rely solely on gospel shows, citing widespread exploitation.\n\nI would not advise any upcoming artist to rely exclusively on gospel shows. Too many times Ive been booked to minister at church events and conferences, only to struggle afterwards to recover even my basic expenses.\n\nShame on those who exploit others in the name of Christ. Lets do better as a community.\n\nThe musician also shared a flyer from a recent gospel event where, after performing, he was met with rudeness when he followed up on a promised payment.\n\nLet me give you a recent example. On Friday, I went to minister at a church (see flyer attached). I didnt charge them a performance fee. All I asked for was a token of $200 to cover my fuel and expenses. Instead of being met with understanding, I was met with rudeness. Suddenly, I was no longer a brother in Christ, but mocked and called a comrade (screenshot attached).\n\nThis is not Kingdom behaviour. This is not how we build each other. And its one of the reasons the gospel industry struggles to move forward,lack of respect, lack of accountability, and non-payment of artists.\n\nIm not posting this to attack anyone, but to spark a real conversation. We dont talk about this enough. If youre a promoter, a church, or an organiser, please do better. Honour your word. Respect the artist. Support the ministry in every sense, said Baba Harare.\n\n",
