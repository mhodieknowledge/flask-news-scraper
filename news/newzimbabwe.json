            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nUNITED Kingdoms (UK) Minister for Africa, Lord Ray Collins, the first British cabinet member to visit in seven years, has confirmed their softened stance towards Zimbabwe and talked of a new approach towards the continent and former colony.\n\nCollins, who visited President Emmerson Mnangagwa at State House on Wednesday, said Prime Minister Keir Starmers government had crafted a new approach that emphasised on listening rather than talking, on Africas agenda and not only theirs.\n\nHis watered-down comments come barely a month after the UK struck off former Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) boss Isaac Moyo, former police Commissioner General Godwin Matanga, ministers Anselem Sanyatwe, Owen Ncube and the Zimbabwe Defence Industries (ZDI) from its sanctions list.\n\nSanyatwe gained infamy for testifying, during an August 1, 2018, Commission of Inquiry in defence of soldiers, who gunned down innocent lives in Harare. Moyo and Matanga formed part of Mnangagwas brutal security apparatus, specifically targeted at dissenting political and human rights activists.\n\nWe are absolutely committed to building a partnership based on equality and respect but on a simple mission of economic growth, growth that can support both our people (and) creating a win-win situation, said Collins.\n\nI am extremely pleased and looking forward to returning to Zimbabwe.\n\nThe new government in the UK is about developing a new approach to the continent of Africa, where we actually launched a consultation last year, a consultation on our approach, which was about listening and not talking, focusing on the continents agenda and not only ours.\n\nThe dramatic shift in policy comes at a time Mnangagwa had unsuccessfully been battling to re-engage with Western countries such as America, the UK, Australia and Canada, who have always pointed out his human rights record as a red flag.\n\nIn December 2024, Collins spoke against readmitting Zimbabwe into the Commonwealth, a union of mainly former British colonies. Speaking in the UK Parliaments House of Lords, he said his Africa office did not support Zimbabwes readmission after an assessment by the Commonwealth Secretariat. He proposed further steps on democracy, government and respect for human rights.\n\nSpeaking to journalists after meeting Mnangagwa on Wednesday, Collins said their approach was not a one size fits all.\n\nHe added: That win-win situation is something that I think we all want to ensure future prosperity for Zimbabwe and future prosperity for the UK.\n\nAs we move forward, what we are absolutely clear, our approach is not one size fits all, it is about strengthening our bilateral relations. I said to His Excellency that I am very determined to return to Zimbabwe to ensure that we actually deliver what we promise.\n\n",

Introduced in 2011, the 787-8 is the first model in Boeings Dreamliner series and is widely used by airlines globally for intercontinental flights.\n\nCapacity:Typically seats between 242 and 290 passengers, depending on airline configuration, making it suitable for both high-traffic and long-distance routes.\n\nRange:Can fly up to 13,530 kilometers non-stop, allowing direct connections between distant cities.\n\nConstruction:Built with advanced composite materials, which make up about 50% of the primary structure,resulting in a lighter, more fuel-efficient aircraft.\n\nTechnology:Equipped with the latest avionics, fly-by-wire controls, and advanced safety systems.\n\nThe Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner is equipped with advanced navigation and safety systems that enhance situational awareness and operational efficiency. The Synthetic Vision System (SVS) provides a 3D view of terrain and potential obstacles, improving pilot decision-making, especially in low-visibility conditions.\n\nThe aircraft features Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA), a centralised system that streamlines maintenance and optimises performance by integrating multiple avionics functions into fewer components.\n\nThe crash occurred just after takeoff,with the cause still under investigation by Air India and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).\n\nRescue and fire teams responded swiftly, and the central government has pledged full support for ongoing operations. As of now, the extent of casualties and the precise cause of the accident remain unconfirmed.\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to the Minister of Civil Aviation, Rammohan Naidu, and took stock of the Air India flight crash incident in Ahmedabad.\n\nThe Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner, known for its reliability and advanced safety features, has a strong operational record, making Thursdays crash a rare and deeply concerning event for Indias aviation sector.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFORMER Mt Pleasant legislator, Fadzayi Mahere has criticized Information Permanent Secretary Nick Mangwana for attempting to portray the International Monetary Fund (IMF)s observations on widespread corruption and the limited acceptance of the ZiG currency as an endorsement of Zimbabwes economic progress.\n\nMahere dismissed this as a disingenuous spin doctoring tactic.\n\nAn IMF delegation, led by Mission Chief Wojciech Maliszewski, is currently in Zimbabwe for the Article IV Consultation, which provides an opportunity to review the countrys economic policies and progress under the IMFs regular assessment framework.\n\nThis weeks review follows an earlier visit in January this year. It is widely considered a critical juncture for Zimbabwes reform agenda.\n\nWhile the Staff Monitored Programme (SMP) does not provide funding, its successful implementation is a prerequisite for future access to concessional financing, potential debt restructuring, and the restoration of confidence among international creditors and investorsall of which Zimbabwe desperately needs.The southern African nation is burdened with a burgeoning public debt that has now exceeded US$21 billion, including more than US$12.3 billion owed to external creditors.Following the visit, IMF Mission Chief Maliszewski said the IMF would like to see a fully functioning local ZiG currency and fiscal discipline with a balance between expenditure and revenue.He also addressed the issue of corruption and stressed the need for a genuine currency exchange market, as well as a credible debt restructuring process.In an attempt to put a positive spin on this, Mangwana posted on his X account his own interpretation of the IMFs comments.The IMF sees macroeconomic stability in Zimbabwe we see it too. They want to see the ZIG becoming fully our national currency  we want that too. They see the ZIG stability we are witnesses.However, Mahere, who is also a constitutional lawyer, strongly disagreed with Mangwanas sentiments.Did you listen carefully to what the IMF representative is actually saying? These are the key takeaways: This Govt has no fiscal discipline. Fiscal discipline is urgently required. The public financial management system is worrisome. Read theres too much corruption.The people need reassurance that the so-called reforms introduced will stay. Read theres no trust or public confidence in what the Govt says about the state of the economy.The ZIG is not yet a national currency. While it may look stable, it is not widely used. The official exchange rate is artificial as demonstrated by the existence of a parallel market rate. The fact that the two dont converge is problematic. You can rig an election but you cannot rig the economy, Mahere wrote on her X account in response to Mangwana.Fourteen months after its introduction, the ZiG currency is still failing to facilitate payments for essential services such as passport issuance, fuel, and other necessities, indicating its shortcomings.The private sector, particularly Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), does not accept ZiG as a form of payment in its daily transactions, leaving many, especially civil servants, searching for US dollars on the parallel market, where the exchange rate is US$1: 40 ZiG, even though the Treasury has set the official exchange rate at US$1: 27 ZiG.\n\nWhile the Staff Monitored Programme (SMP) does not provide funding, its successful implementation is a prerequisite for future access to concessional financing, potential debt restructuring, and the restoration of confidence among international creditors and investorsall of which Zimbabwe desperately needs.\n\nThe southern African nation is burdened with a burgeoning public debt that has now exceeded US$21 billion, including more than US$12.3 billion owed to external creditors.\n\nFollowing the visit, IMF Mission Chief Maliszewski said the IMF would like to see a fully functioning local ZiG currency and fiscal discipline with a balance between expenditure and revenue.\n\nHe also addressed the issue of corruption and stressed the need for a genuine currency exchange market, as well as a credible debt restructuring process.\n\nIn an attempt to put a positive spin on this, Mangwana posted on his X account his own interpretation of the IMFs comments.\n\nThe IMF sees macroeconomic stability in Zimbabwe we see it too.

            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nThe Centre for Natural Resources Governance (CNRG) has implored the government to take immediate action and ban the exportation of lithium concentrate, rather than waiting until 2027 to implement the proposed policy.\n\nThis follows the governments announcement yesterday that lithium concentrate exports will be banned from January 2027.\n\nIn a statement issued on Wednesday, CNRG stressed the importance of prompt action, arguing that delaying the ban would only provide smugglers with further opportunities to plunder the countrys natural resources without facing any repercussions.\n\nAs CNRG, we view this urgent reform as being delayed into irrelevance. We stress that the ban should be implemented immediately to prevent further depletion of our natural capital due to unchecked lithium exploitation, which has devastating socio-economic and environmental implications, CNRG stated.\n\nThe organisation further urged the government to address the issue of porous borders, which have allowed some lithium to be smuggled into South Africa and Mozambique without any benefit to Zimbabwe\n\nZimbabwes lithium wealth risks being squandered, as unchecked exports, weak regulation, and opaque deals undermine its potential for industrial transformation.\n\nAlready, allegations of lithium smuggling across porous borders into South Africa and Mozambique raise concerns regarding corruption and illicit mineral and financial flows.\n\nUnverified reports indicate that up to 3,000 tons of lithium ore leave the country dailya staggering total of 1.62 million tons over the past 18 monthswith minimal accountability, little benefit to the state, and no protection for affected communities.\n\nDuring a post-cabinet media briefing in Harare yesterday, Mines Minister Winston Chitando said the government will ban the exportation of lithium ore as part of an effort to promote value addition and ensure that the country comprehensively benefits from its natural resources.\n\nCabinet reaffirmed the ban on the export of chrome ores and stressed the need to develop the ferrochrome industry locally. The Ministry of Mines and Mining Development will strengthen the implementation of the use it or lose it principle, and holders of all unutilised mining titles, particularly chrome, are requested to take note of the Governments position, Chitando said.\n\nHe added that Bikita Minerals and Arcadia Lithium are in the process of establishing lithium sulphate value addition facilities to beneficiate locally produced lithium ores. From January 2027 onwards, the export of lithium concentrate will no longer be permitted.\n\nLithium plays a crucial role in the clean energy transition due to its essential function in energy storage. It is a key component in lithium-ion batteries, which power electric vehicles (EVs) and facilitate large-scale energy storage systems for renewable energy sources.\n\n",

The newly recruited adjunct lecturers drawn from the streets are also not attending lectures. Dissertations are not being supervised, and exams are not being written.\n\nThere were demonstrations from the lecturers, yet other students are to go for work-related learning. It seems this semester is a sheer waste of time to students as well as a loss of parents hard-earned money, Moyo said.\n\nFurther, the MP expressed concern over the chaos at the learning institution.\n\nThere is chaos and uncertainty at our institution. If it pleases you, Hon. Speaker Sir, I request the Hon. Minister of Higher Education, Innovation, Science and Technology Development, to come and give us a ministerial statement on the negotiations, deadlocks, or practical police intervention to bring normalcy to our tertiary institution, Moyo added.\n\nThe Speaker responded, We will advise the Hon. Minister if he can make a Ministerial Statement on the situation.\n\nUZ lecturers are demanding a return to their pre-2018 salaries, where a junior lecturer earned US$2,250 per month. Currently, they earn approximately US$230.\n\n",
