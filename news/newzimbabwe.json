This cowardly act must be condemned in the strongest terms possible. How can we live in a country that fears words? Mpofu wrote on his X account on Tuesday morning.\n\nWriting on his X account on Tuesday morning, self-exiled former Cabinet Minister, Saviour Kasukuwere, said the bombing of SAPES Trust is a shameful act.\n\nThis is shameful. A leopard cannot change its spots! We have to choose hope over fear.\n\nAlthough Mnangagwa styles himself as a constitutionalist and has declined to plan for running beyond 2028, he has done little to stop those who are canvassing support for him to continue in power until 2030.\n\nThe calls for Mnangagwa to continue beyond 2028 have caused fissures within his ruling party, Zanu PF.\n\nAnalysts have warned that the succession battle in Zanu PF could cause chaos and violence in the country, as they believe that the calls for Mnangagwa to go beyond 2028 are purely a strategy to frustrate his deputy, Rtd Constantino Chiwenga, who is widely expected to take over.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe African Regional Organisation of the International Trade Union Confederation (ITUC-Africa), which represents over 18 million workers across the continent, has strongly rejected ZANU PFs plans to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas term.\n\nThe ruling ZANU-PF party recently endorsed a proposal to delay the 2028 general elections, extending Mnangagwas term by two years to 2030. The resolution, adopted at the partys annual conference in Mutare, directed the ruling partys Legal Affairs Secretary to begin drafting the necessary constitutional amendments.\n\nMnangagwa is currently serving his second and final term, as is mandated by the constitution. While he has previously described himself as a constitutionalist, adding he will step down in 2028, he has done nothing to oppose his loyalists, who are pushing for him to hang onto power.\n\nIn a statement of solidarity with the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions (ZCTU), ITUC-Africa Secretary General Joel Odigie said African workers have consistently upheld democracy and constitutionalism as the foundation of peace, justice, and shared prosperity.\n\nITUC-Africa Secretary General JoelOdigie\n\nWe join ZCTU in urging African citizens, civil society, and the labour movement to remain vigilant and steadfast in defending the integrity of their constitutions, said Odigie.\n\nSocieties that work are those governed by the rule of law, not the law of force. When constitutions are trampled, democracy dies and with it, the hopes of workers for decent work, social justice, and equitable development.\n\nOdigie called on African Union member states, regional economic communities, and global partners to reaffirm their commitment to constitutional rule and accountable democratic governance as essential pillars of Africas transformation agenda.\n\nThe continental labour leader also rejected military involvement in civil governance and condemned civilian coups, where leaders manipulate constitutions to unlawfully extend their stay in power.\n\nHe further criticised attempts to silence opposition voices, manipulate electoral systems, or stage sham elections designed to entrench authoritarian rule, saying such actions erode hard-won democratic gains.\n\nWe commend leaders across Africa who have resisted the temptation to alter term limits or manipulate constitutions for personal gain. These are true statespersons, guardians of constitutional democracy worthy of respect by future generations, Odigie said.\n\nHe added that leaders who dismantle constitutional order and weaken democratic institutions for the sake of political survival corrode governance, polarise societies, and expose their nations to instability, insecurity, and economic decline.\n\n",
