This marks a 511% increase from 2019 levels, a remarkable turnaround in just six years.\n\nThe expansion aligns with Zimbabwes broader strategy to reduce dependence on imports, especially following the global grain price spikes triggered by theRussiaUkraineconflict.\n\nWheatis the countrys second most important cereal after maize, and domestic self-sufficiency is seen as critical to stabilising food prices and strengthening food security.\n\nFocus on export opportunities and market stability\n\nWith domestic needs fully met, Zimbabwe is now seeking export opportunities within the region, particularly in neighboring countries that continue to face wheat shortages.\n\nHowever, Masuka emphasized that local supply remains secure and that the government has taken measures to stabilise pricing and ensure smooth distribution.\n\nThe government has released 6,518 metric tonnes to millers in recent weeks to stabilise supply and pricing levels of wheat products, he said, noting that the Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA) continues to coordinate marketing and distribution to maintain market balance.\n\nDespite the surplus, Zimbabwe will continue importing limited volumes of high-gluten wheat, which is preferred by some millers for specific bread formulations.\n\nCertain millers have indicated that their mills and bread styles require high gluten content wheat not achievable in locally produced wheat, Masuka explained.\n\nAccording to him, as per current policy, such wheat will continue to be imported under existing arrangements, without any additional costs.\n\nThe government is urging registered millers and industry players to collaborate closely with authorities under the AMA framework to ensure a consistent balance between production, demand, and market stability.\n\nZimbabwes wheat success story reflects years of deliberate investment in irrigation infrastructure, farmer training, and private-sector partnerships.\n\nAccording to the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), sub-SaharanAfricastill imports over 80% of its wheat consumption, underscoring Zimbabwes rare achievement in the region.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has dismissed businessman Luka Ignatius Fabriss bid to overturn a US$500,000 default judgment granted in favour of Tendai Mashamhanda, ruling that Fabris must face the consequences of his lawyers negligence.\n\nJustice Jacob Manzunzu threw out Fabriss application for rescission of judgment, which sought to undo the ruling granted after he failed to respond to Mashamhandas lawsuit over an unpaid loan, describing his explanation as unreasonable and his defence as devoid of bona fides.\n\nThe applicant cannot entirely put the blame on his erstwhile legal practitioner because he too had a lackadaisical approach towards the case, said Justice Manzunzu.\n\nHe went into a deep slumber only to be awakened by the execution in September 2024.\n\nFabris had borrowed US$500,000 from Mashamhanda in December 2021, agreeing to repay the sum by February 2022 with 1% monthly interest. When he defaulted, Mashamhanda sued and obtained a default judgment in May 2024 after Fabris and his lawyer ignored several letters and court notices.\n\nThe businessman argued that his former lawyer, Alex Mambosasa, failed to file a plea because he was in South Africa and had left the parties to negotiate an out-of-court settlement. But the court found that documents had been both emailed and hand-delivered to the lawyers office, which confirmed receipt, making the excuse untenable.\n\nNo reason is given to suggest he was not in wilful default, said Justice Manzunzu. With the advent of the IECMS system, absence from the country can no longer be an excuse for failure to file a plea. Technology allows a lawyer in South Africa to file court documents from that location.\n\nThe judge emphasised that there was a limit to how far courts could sympathise with litigants blaming their lawyers negligence.\n\nTime has come when our courts should be slow in sympathising with litigants who fail to comply with the rules due to lack of diligence by their legal representatives, he ruled. Applicant made his choice of a legal representative and he must stand by his choice.\n\nJustice Manzunzu also questioned Fabriss claim that he had a solid defence, noting that his earlier correspondence with Mashamhanda contained admissions of liability and proposals to settle the debt through shares in his mining company, Hotburn Minerals (Pvt) Ltd.\n\nThis is incongruent with a party who denies liability, the judge said. The applicants conduct shows wilfulness and absence of prospects of success.\n\nFinding the rescission application to be a mere delaying tactic, the judge ordered Fabris to pay costs on a higher scale, citing the respondents unnecessary expenses caused by Fabriss negligence.\n\nThe respondent has been put out of pocket by the applicants conduct, he said. The circumstances of this case warrant the granting of costs on a higher scale.\n\nThe ruling means the default judgment stands, and Mashamhanda may proceed with execution to recover the US$500,000 loan plus interest and legal costs from Fabris.\n\n",

            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo, IOL\n\nZimbabwes ruling ZanuPF has publicly dismissed assertions thatthe push to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas termis a covert move to sideline or signal no confidence in Vice President Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nZanuPF national spokesperson and former ambassador to China, Christopher Hatikure Mutsvangwa, insisted that Chiwenga is not entitled to replace Mnangagwa automatically and that any suggestion of anointment is misplaced.\n\nIt is not that we do not want him (Chiwenga). He can declare his candidacy. There is no provision in the Zimbabwean constitution that the vice president is the automatic leader of the country afterwards. We go to elections, and people vote in Zimbabwe for the leadership. So he needs to be voted.\n\nThis is not a papacy. This is not cardinals in Rome, sitting in a cabal, deciding that this is going to be the person succeeding the pope. This is a democratic country, and people go to elections. If he wants, he can declare his candidacy for elections in the party or outside the party and do the test of the vote. This effort of someone being anointed for whatever reason, it is totally against the tenets of democratic governance, Mutsvangwa told SABC News.\n\nMutsvangwa said Chiwenga is not the only politician aspiring for higher office in Zimbabwe.\n\nWhy this particular preoccupation with this particular person, except that there are some people who feel that he should be anointed as the leader of Zimbabwe. This is not a papacy. This is a democratic, constitutionally-run country, Mutsvangwa insisted.\n\nMnangagwa has previously said he is a constitutionalist and would step down in 2028.\n\nThe resolution has drawn a mixed response. Opposition activists and civil society figures have warned the move risks entrenching authoritarian tendencies. Some analysts say the extension could be framed domestically as necessary for continuity while simultaneously raising concerns among donors and regional partners about democratic backsliding.\n\nZimbabweans in the diaspora  including those living in South Africa  have also voiced unease. In interviews with IOL, some critics argued the extension reveals ZanuPFs reluctance to allow a generational leadership change, while supporters countered that stability and economic recovery require continuity at the top.\n\nLast week,former Zanu PF bigwig and cabinet minister Saviour Kasukuwererubbished the former liberation movements bold plans to extend Mnangagwas term of office to 2030, warning that the move will end badly for both the president and Zimbabwe.\n\nSpeaking to IOL, Kasukuwere said:He (Mnangagwa) is dreaming and he has set himself up for a gigantic failure. Greediness knows no boundaries, and this will lead to a huge disaster for the country.\n\nZanu PF has emboldened its move to push through the proposal allowing Mnangagwa to remain in powerbeyond his current constitutional term, which ends in 2028. The party recently adopted a resolution at its annual conference backing the extension to align with the governments so-called Vision 2030 development agenda.\n\nKasukuwere, once a senior figure in the Zanu PF government led by Robert Mugabe before going into exile during the 2017 military intervention, became one of the most prominent former insiders to condemn the partys Mnangagwa plan publicly.\n\nThe political debate in South Africa is further complicated by rising antiimmigrant sentiment and calls by some local groups for Zimbabwean migrants to return home. Observers warn that prolonged political uncertainty in Harare could exacerbate tensions in host communities across the region.\n\nIf ZanuPF moves ahead, the party would refer the resolution to parliament  where, with its twothirds majority, it could initiate the constitutional amendment process. That would likely trigger legal and political challenges from opposition parties and civil society, and could prompt increased scrutiny from regional bodies such as SADC and the AU.\n\nWhether Mnangagwas extension will be presented as a caretaker continuity measure or a hard political move to shape succession remains the central political question for the months ahead.\n\n",
