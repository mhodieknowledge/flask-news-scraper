The announcement occurred just days after the Nobel Committee in Oslo announced that Venezuelan opposition leaderMaria Corina Machadohad won the 2025 Nobel Peace Prize for fighting dictatorship in the South American country.\n\nThe embassy closures with the two US allies also followed weeks of escalating tensions between Caracas and Washington.\n\nVenezuela has called on the UN for support over several deadly US military strikes on vessels off its Caribbean coast, which Washington alleges were carrying drugs.\n\nSome US allies on the UN Security Council called for de-escalation and dialogue.\n\nVenezuela has said it is in a situation where it is rational to expect an armed attack against the country in the short term, and Maduro has alleged the US is seeking a change in government.\n\nWashington has not responded to this accusation but has called Venezuelas socialist leader the illegitimate head of a narco-state. The US has also announced a new counter-narcotics task force in its Southern Command, a military branch that oversees Latin America.\n\nThe governments of Zimbabwe and Burkina Faso are more aligned with that of Russia, which has supported Venezuela at the UN and accused the US of acting according to the cowboy principle of shoot first.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFormer Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) leader Nelson Chamisa said he will not participate in the 17 October planned protests against President Emmerson Mnangagwas government.\n\nThis decision, he explains, stems from the oppositions experience with the November 2017 military takeover. He says their involvement then served as a salutary lesson, teaching them not to become entangled in Zanu-PFs internal factional and succession battles.\n\nThis follows a call from ousted Zanu-PF Central Committee member Blessed Runesu Geza for a one-million-man march on Friday, aimed at protesting against Mnangagwa and his alleged corrupt cartel. Gezas accusations target a number of high-profile figures, including controversial business tycoons such as Wicknell Chivayo, Geo Pomona CEO Delish Nguwaya, Paul Tungwarara, and Kudakwashe Tagwirei.\n\nHowever, analysts suggest that the planned protest goes beyond mere accusations of corruption but points to a deeper succession war playing out between Mnangagwas faction and his deputy, Rtd General Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nChiwenga is the favourite to take over from Mnangagwa, with many believing he has been patiently waiting for his turn. Yet, his path is reportedly being obstructed by Mnangagwa loyalists, who are now calling for the incumbent to extend his term of office beyond the constitutional limit of two terms.\n\nThis echoes the experience of the opposition previously, the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), as it was then known, which took to the streets in a protest that ousted former President Robert Mugabe from power, anticipating a role in a new government.\n\nThat hope proved to be short-lived. The MDC felt betrayed and used, having been abandoned by Zanu-PF and Mnangagwa himself shortly after Mugabes departure.\n\nResponding directly to calls for him and his supporters to join Fridays protests in Harare, Chamisa wrote, 2017 taught us a big lesson!.\n\nHe added that the root cause of the countrys problems lies in disputed elections, maintaining that until this issue is addressed, Zimbabwe will remain trapped in its socioeconomic and political challenges.\n\nIgnoring the 2023 stolen election is ignoring the root of our crisis. Anything that does not address the 2023 stolen election is a fraud and a waste of time. Corruption, capture, suffering  theyre symptoms of a disputed mandate and a contested government. Lets treat the cause, not the symptoms, Chamisa wrote on his X account Monday.\n\nChamisa still commands a considerable following among opposition supporters despite his resignation from the CCC in January 2024, which left the opposition in further disarray.\n\n",

After matriculating, his parents offered him a choice: a new car or R100,000 in cash. He chose the money and used it to invest in DJ equipment. With his entrepreneurial parents full support  and encouragement to pursue formal education  he began his career, carefully tracking every cent spent. Their belief in his vision laid the foundation for his success, and he remains deeply grateful for it.\n\nBeyond the decks and designer fits, Oscar is also a devoted family man. In a recent podcast, he opened up about his love for his family and his role as a father.\n\nI just want to keep inspiring the youth, guiding them, and helping them avoid the mistakes we made, he shared, looking forward to the next chapter of his journey.\n\nOscar Mbo is also the founder and lead voice behind The Ashmed Hour, a popular entertainment podcast that blends music and thoughtful conversation  showcasing not only his talent but his depth as a creative.\n\nNow, with Vuka being considered for a Grammy,Oscar Mbostands at the edge of a new era.

An order that there shall be no order as to costs is appropriate in the circumstances, Justice Deme ruled.\n\nDr Saidi remains barred from practising general medicine and must first lodge an appeal through the Health Professions Authority before seeking constitutional redress.\n\n",
