The precious metals exploration company said it intersected a reef containing quartz and sulphide-bearing veins in a previously inaccessible level of the main shaft at prospect 1 in the Hillside Project in Matabeleland, Zimbabwe.\n\nShares in Kavango Resources were up 23% to 0.77 pence in London.\n\nKavango CEO Ben Turney said the results produced so far were very impressive and looked forward to a good season ahead.\n\nWe are extremely pleased with the latest results from prospect 1. The new reefs identified add to the growing number of opportunities for near-term, significant gold production at Hillside.\n\nWe look forward to bringing the drill rig back to prospect 1 as soon as we can. The new reefs are open on strike, with grades appearing to increase with depth. After establishing the reefs extent, we hope to move into defining a resource we can bring into production as quickly as possible.\n\nThe company said mapping and sampling on the reef, alongside the discovery of further mineralisation, indicates previously unknown potential for both lateral and vertical continuity on the back of plans to test the extent of the reefs with both surface and underground drilling.\n\nKavango intends to establish prospect 1 as a third area of near-term gold production at Hillside, alongside prospects 3 and 4.\n\nIt said the results will inform further drilling to define a larger, longer-term underground mine than previously anticipated.\n\nThe miner added that it is also proposing to increase processing capacity at prospect 1 to provide flexibility for greater production in future.\n\n",

The real war is against poverty and deprivation.\n\nHe added, Poverty and deprivation are exacerbated by physical armed battles, which should stop for the progress of all African peoples. Poverty and deprivation are fought using knowledge, skills, and understanding amongst peoples. This is the war that Africa should be fighting.\n\nThe Minister underscored the need for African nations to unite in addressing these root causes of instability, particularly the socio-economic factors that fuel violence.\n\nAccording to Murwira, the Democratic Republic of Congos (DRC) crisis is not merely a result of armed conflict but a symptom of deeper issues of poverty and underdevelopment.

From there, I began to doubt their faith, he said.\n\nHoly Ten said it was a source of deep embarrassment that Angel, given his supposed holy standing, would make such requests.\n\nNot only guns, but Mudiwa then opened his bag and showed me condoms. I swear, and Im ready to be taken to court for this, I swear that I will never return to their church again. You can ask my crew. Those people are spinning a yarn, he said.\n\nAngel presides over the Good News Church\n\nTwo years ago, he was embroiled in controversy after being exposed in the four-part Al Jazeera documentary, The Gold Mafia, which detailed undercover operations across three continents and revealed a trove of incriminating documents capturing gold smuggling.\n\nAngel was secretly filmed boasting that he could move over US$1 billion of dirty cash with ease, leveraging his diplomatic immunity to facilitate a scheme where unaccounted funds could be exchanged for Zimbabwes gold.\n\nAngel and his business partner, Rikki Doolan, further claimed their laundering operations had the blessing of President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nMudiwa Hood, on the other hand, is the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and founder of several companies, including Sky Angel Private Jet Charter, Fundmass, Optima Construction, Disrupt Media, and Bisep Security.\n\nHe fancies himself a serial entrepreneur, author, and fashion mogul.\n\nHoly Tens accusations have struck a chord, laying bare the hypocrisy he perceives within these circles.\n\nThese revelations, if true, paint a portrait of men drunk on power, flaunting wealth, and abusing their positions with impunity.\n\n",
