We are finally free after a whole year of persecution. It only strengthened our resolve, Sitima said after the acquittal.\n\n",

Just recently, mineral exporting companies revealed that the central bank has not been paying their 30% export surrender in local currency.\n\nThe latest decision by Bitumen Worlddemonstrates the authorities appetite to uphold currency stability even at the cost of other critical economic imperatives.\n\nThe Zimbabwean government, one of the companys largest debtors, is experiencing significant challenges in making timely payments to its contractors. The government is facing delays in settling arrears, affecting various projects, including road rehabilitation and dam construction.\n\nWhile efforts are underway to establish payment plans and small payments have been received, these financial constraints have contributed to the companys decision to realign its operations to remain resilient in a challenging fiscal environment, said the company.\n\nThe company said this necessary transition reflects a committed effort to adapt to the current economic challenges, including operating under cash flow pressures caused by delayed payments from clients.\n\nBW said it recognises and deeply values the dedication and professionalism of all its employees and is committed to handling the process with respect, transparency, and dignity, offering support to those affected through severance packages and transition assistance.\n\nBW CEO, Andre Zietsman, said the decision has been very tough but had to be made due to limited options at hand.\n\nOver recent months, we have engaged in extensive discussions and evaluations to guide Bitumen World through this difficult period. While the decision to restructure was not made lightly, it is essential for ensuring our long-term viability and ability to continue contributing meaningfully to infrastructure development in Zimbabwe and beyond, he said.\n\nHe said the employees who have worked tirelessly to restore the countrys infrastructure glory will, unfortunately, suffer heavy blows when they see their jobs going down the drain.\n\nThe tragedy of these layoffs is that they impact the very people who built this prestigious brand  a brand that was wholly created by Zimbabweans, said Zietsman.\n\nThe company committed to handling the process with respect, transparency, and dignity, offering support to those affected through severance packages and transition assistance.\n\n",
