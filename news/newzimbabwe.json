Afghanistan were 95 for two off 30 overs in reply when bad light stopped play.\n\nThe Zimbabwe first innings total was their highest in a Test, bettering 563 for nine against the West Indies in Harare 23 years ago. It was the sixth Zimbabwe innings to exceed 500 runs.\n\nHaving made 145 runs on the first day, Williams added nine more before being caught by Rahmat Shah close to the boundary line off a Naveed Zadran bouncer.\n\nHis 154 overtook a previous best of 151 not out, also against Afghanistan, in Abu Dhabi three years ago.\n\nWilliams, batting at No. 4, struck three sixes and 10 fours off 174 balls in a 266-minute stand in the city where he was born. It was his fourth century in six Tests.\n\nHis partnerships included 163 for the fifth wicket with captain Craig Ervine, who went on to make 104, including 10 fours, before his inside edge was snapped up by wicketkeeper Afsar Zazai.\n\nIf I can lead by example and not by talking I believe my young teammates will learn quickly, said 38-year-old Williams.\n\nZimbabwe fielded three debutants, including 68-run opener Ben Curran, and three others are making just their second Test appearances.\n\nMiddle-order Brian Bennett was another Zimbabwe centurion, hitting a brisk unbeaten 110 that included four sixes and five fours.\n\nTeenage spinner Allah Ghazanfar was the most successful Afghanistan bowler, but his three wickets proved expensive as he conceded 127 runs.\n\nThe Afghanistan innings began disastrously with Test newcomer Sediqullah Atal out for three in the second over after a Trevor Gwandu delivery uprooted his middle stump.\n\nFellow opener Abdul Malik was dismissed for 23 before Shah patiently built an unbeaten 49 that included a six and five fours. Captain Hashmatullah Shahidi was 16 not out.\n\nBoth teams are seeking a first Test victory since beating each other three years ago.\n\nBrief scores\n\nZimbabwe 586 in 135.2 overs (Sean Williams 154, Brian Bennett 110 not out, Craig Ervine 104, Ben Curran 68; Allah Ghazanfar 3-127) v Afghanistan 95-2 in 30 overs (Rahmat Shah 49 not out).

It could be about loyalty to EDs vision, a political analyst suggested.\n\nMnangagwa has reshuffled his cabinet multiple times in recent years, often citing the need for efficiency.\n\nDuring his Christmas Day interview with ZBC, Mnangagwa emphasized the importance of performance and accountability among leaders.\n\nThis is the season to reflect, not just on personal matters, but on professional performance. Those entrusted with leadership must evaluate their contributions to the people of Zimbabwe, he said.\n\nWe must look at that and say this was my team, this is the team that has delivered our vision. Or does it require interrogating it? And are you going forward with that team like you were saying? No, I cant release it now, Ill make my statement after January 1, 2025.\n\nThis is because, at this moment, everybody is celebrating Christmas. Without me, how shall we? I said dont go and do what I will be doing. We reflect on how weve worked as a team and what weaknesses have I identified, what is necessary for me to strengthen, to execute government work.\n\nWhile stopping short of naming specific cabinet ministers or portfolios under review, Mnangagwa made it clear that underperformance would not be tolerated.\n\nZimbabwe deserves a government that works tirelessly for the people. This requires commitment and results from those in leadership, he added.\n\nHis remarks have left the political landscape buzzing, with many speculating about which ministers might be affected by the potential shakeup.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nA biodiversity hotspot in a remote part of South Africa has become the hub of an illegal trade in protected plant species, with organised crime groups capitalising on overseas demand.\n\nTheyve not just stolen our land or our plants, theyve stolen our heritage as well, a livestock farmer angrily tells the BBC, as she expresses dismay at the social and ecological crisis that the poaching has caused.\n\nMost of the plants in question are a variety known as succulents, named for their ability to hold water and survive in arid climates.\n\nMany of the worlds succulent species are only found in the Succulent Karoo desert, which spans South Africa and Namibia.\n\nSucculent species range in size, shape and colour  some look like small multi-coloured buttons and some look like cacti, sprouting colourful flowers at certain times of the year.\n\nWhile these varieties can be cultivated in nurseries, global demand is also fuelling the poaching of these plants from the wild which are then smuggled and sold online to buyers in the US, Europe and East Asia.\n\nIn Kamieskroon, a small town in the centre of South Africas Namaqualand region, the rolling hills have become a haven for poachers.\n\nSome of the species are highly localised, and so can be wiped out by just a small amount of poaching.\n\nIn South Africa, we know already of seven species that has been wiped out completely and there are certainly more species that will go extinct very soon, says Pieter van Wyk, a nursery curator at the/Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park.\n\nIt is hard to obtain figures for how many plants are being poached, but the non-governmental organisation Traffic reports that1.6 million illegally harvested succulents were seizedby South Africas law enforcement agencies between 2019 and 2024. This only represents the contraband that was detected, so the true figure is likely to be far higher.\n\nThe South African government is well aware of the problem, and unveiled a strategy in 2022 to combat poaching. It includes running community programmes about the need to protect the environment.\n\nAccording to Mr Van Wyk and other conservationists, plant poaching has been booming since the Covid-19 lockdown in 2020.\n\nWith international traders unable to travel to South Africa during that time, they turned to local people to collect succulents for them and post them out of the country.\n\nMr Van Wyk says this coincided with an increase in global demand.\n\nPeople had more time to try to find something to keep busy with, and plants were one of the only things that in your house, could connect you to the outside world.\n\nThis has been seized upon by organised crime syndicates who hire teams of plant poachers and then market the wild plants on social media and e-commerce platforms.\n\nThe syndicates saw this as an opportunity of making something viral telling a wide as possible public: We have this super-strange looking thing that comes from the African continent,' Mr Van Wyk says.\n\nThen the public just loses their heads and they say: I want to buy one, and [the syndicates] arrange for the species to be poached, he adds.\n\nThe uptick in organised crime activity in the region is having knock-on effects on local communities.\n\nThis is a low-income area, people are not rich here, and people will exploit opportunities for income, explains Malinda Gardiner from Conservation South Africa.\n\nExpressing a similar view, the livestock farmer whom the BBC spoke to says there is always an influx of money in her community when poaching takes place.\n\nWhen we see young men going up in the mountain areas, we know theyre poachers, adds the farmer, who asks not to be identified for fear of reprisals.\n\nThey use screwdrivers to uproot the succulents and they carry backpacks and sacks to keep the stolen plants.\n\nA few days after that, there is an outbreak of binge drinking and illegal activity.\n\nWhen they get the money, theres more drugs, more alcohol, children are neglected because mummy is drunk, daddy is drunk, theres no food, adds the farmer.\n\nMs Gardiner worries that the tensions will have longer-term effects.\n\nSmall communities here really need each other but this brings distrust. It brings a split in the communities as well, she says.\n\nMr Van Wyks assessment is starker: People are being abused and enslaved by syndicates and buyers.\n\nAttempts are being made to raise awareness among buyers about the importance of understanding where a plant might have come from.\n\nChina has become a major source of demand for wild succulents in the last few years, but an internet campaign there to educate people about the illegal succulent trade has seen some results.\n\nThe Clean Internet for Conophytum campaign was launched in March 2023 by the China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development Foundation.\n\nAccording to the foundations deputy secretary-general Linda Wong, they have seen an 80% reduction in online adverts for conophytum  a type of succulent  with an unknown source, and buyers are starting to ask questions about where plants being sold online have come from.\n\nThe key is awareness. Once people know, they want to take action. They want to take responsibility to consume those plants and enjoy their beauty in a very responsible way, she tells the BBC.\n\nConservationists advise customers all over the world to ask about the origin of a plant, and under no circumstances should they buy those advertised as wild.\n\nTraffic and the UKs Kew Gardens recently announced that they were teaming up with eBayto develop new ways of preventing the sale of wild succulents on its platform.\n\nIn South Africa, Mr Van Wyk says more should be done to promote the cultivation of succulents that can be grown and harvested legally, to reduce the demand for poaching.\n\nWe as a country need to say that: We have this resource, and there are other countries that are majorly benefiting from this, why arent we?' he tells the BBC.\n\nMr Van Wyk now runs a nursery at the /Ai /Ais-Richtersveld Transfrontier Park which looks after plants that have been confiscated by law enforcement, and he says they have received more than 200,000 so far.\n\nIts obviously stressful seeing things disappearing. But if you study these plants, it brings so much joy and pleasure and you just forget about all the nonsense thats happening in the world, Mr Van Wyk says.\n\n",

The incidents were reported in Chiwundura and Kwekwe, among other areas.\n\nIn Chiwundura, Zanu PF activists Calvin Mhondiwa, Forbes Choto, and Adam Dhliwayo threatened a male victim belonging to a group supporting former CCC leader Nelson Chamisa. They allegedly harassed him for campaigning against the ongoing Mnangagwa beyond 2028 movement, promising to deal with the victim violently and extending such treatment to anyone opposed to the campaign, the report reads.\n\nZanu PF must amend Sections 91(2) and 382(7) of the constitution to allow Mnangagwa to extend his term.\n\nZPP has called on the police to take action on the allegations levelled against Zanu PF officials.\n\nThe ZRP should take concrete steps to prevent and investigate incidents of violence, particularly those related to the ED2030 campaign. The police must also ensure that perpetrators are held accountable and that victims receive adequate protection, said ZPP.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) has refuted claims that the recent deaths of wildlife, livestock, and aquatic life at Lake Chivero Recreational Park were due to cyanide poisoning.\n\nTwo weeks ago, the authority reported that four white rhinos, among other wildlife and livestock, died after ingesting water contaminated by cyanobacteria from Lake Chivero.\n\nThis publication later revealed that an algal bloom in the lake caused the suffocation of aquatic life and the death of thousands of fish.\n\nSubsequent social media posts claimed there was intentional poisoning at the park.\n\nZimParks spokesperson Tinashe Farawo said these allegations were unfounded, clarifying that their investigations determined that the cyanobacteria were caused by the ongoing discharge of raw sewage into the lake by the Harare City Council.\n\nZimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks) has noted with concern a letter circulating on social media alleging that the recent deaths of wildlife and fish at Lake Chivero are attributed to cyanide poisoning.\n\nWe wish to assure the public that thorough investigations conducted by the University of Zimbabwe and our own Veterinary and Capture Unit have conclusively shown that the deaths are, in fact, caused by cyanobacteria.\n\nThe Authority categorically distances itself from any misinformation circulating on various social media platforms. We urge the public to disregard such unfounded claims and rely on official communication channels for accurate information, Farawo stated.\n\nFarawo emphasised that ZimParks is dedicated to rectifying the issues currently affecting Lake Chivero to protect the nations natural heritage.\n\nWe are working tirelessly with relevant stakeholders to address the issue and prevent future occurrences, he added.\n\nIn a viral letter posted on social media a user named Simba Mhofu alleged that the poisoning of the lake was part of a scheme to engineer a crisis that would allow a selected company to be awarded a contract for remediation.\n\nHe wrote, Now here is how the plot will unfold. A company called Watermark was corruptly awarded a tender by Harare City Council to install sewage pipes (Amalinda project), and this tender is being vigorously contested as it was highly inflated. The tender was previously quoted for under US$2 million by another company, and Watermark quoted US$16 million and was awarded this tender through corruption and as I mentioned this is in the process of being challenged.\n\nThe owners of Watermark then decided to come up with an evil plot and create a crisis by poisoning the water at Lake Chivero thereby killing thousands of fish and the four rhinos you mentioned.\n\nThe poisoning is meant to get people in positions of authority to panic and approve plus fund the sewage pipe project. In their evil plot they are pushing a false narrative blaming raw sewage which is overflowing into Lake Chivero as the source of the rhino poisoning.\n\nSo in the next few days the government will declare a state of disaster and this company called Watermark will be awarded money to sort out the problem which they created themselves.\n\n",
