He was fingered as the main man behind violent attacks that claimed the life of an opposition supporter in Kwekwe, in the run-up to the 2018 elections.\n\nThe UK announces the delisting of sanctions against individuals Owen Ncube, Isaac Moyo, Godwin Matanga, Anselem Sanyatwe, and the entity Zimbabwe Defence Industries (ZDI), reads a statement on the UK governments website.\n\nThe revocations follow a similar move from the European Union in February 2025, when they delisted their last remaining entity (ZDI) whilst renewing their existing Zimbabwe sanctions framework.The US also removed a number of designations in March 2024.\n\nZDI was listed by the UK soon after late President Robert Mugabe chucked out the European Union (EU) observer mission ahead of the 2002 elections.\n\nIt stood accused of providing arms used in the abuse of ordinary Zimbabweans.\n\nThe recent round of removals will be taken as a triumph for President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who has been on an overdrive courting the West.\n\nOver recent years, the EU, UK and America have eased restrictions on Zimbabweans and entities that had been fingered in corruption and human rights abuses.\n\n",

Since 2021 to date, only four of the seven vehicles have been delivered, leaving three outstanding, Guvamatanga said.\n\nHe told PAC the company had made an undertaking to deliver the outstanding vehicles by the 2nd of July 2025.\n\nThe ministry has also returned to pass a request for the outcome of the debatement hearing to enable the initiation of federal protection against the supplier if they fail to deliver in July.\n\nAlso, the ministry has ensured that no prepayments are made to suppliers of vehicles before delivery.\n\nPayments are only made for vehicles that are already delivered.\n\nIn the event that the supplier is set to receive an advance payment, the ministry will ensure that a bank guarantee equivalent to the requested payment value is provided by a registered commercial bank, said the Finance secretary.\n\n",

However, Dstv did not air the episode in question; it was only aired on the Podcast and Chill channel on YouTube.\n\nDstvs digital distribution partner, Leading Edge Growth, confirmed toTimeslivethat Dstv has removed the popular podcast.\n\nLeading Edge Growth CEO Lufuno Maliavusa gave the confirmation that the show has been pulled.\n\nCiting To keep our content slate dynamic and engaging, we will continue to make adjustments to our roster. Notably, season one ofPodcast and Chilland season one ofAwkward Datesare nearing their final episodes in the coming weeks, making way for fresh and exciting content to take their place in these time slots.\n\nThis follows after MultiChoice refused to confirm the news of the shows cancellation. The Group only said it licensed a slate of podcasts from Leading Edge Growth, which was responsible for curating the podcast slate, taking into account audience dynamics and content demand.\n\nHowever, MacG is reportedlyunmoved by the news, as he is pursuing other endeavours.\n\nThe episode that spoke about Dlaminireceived attention from the Deputy Ministerof Women, Youth and Persons with Disabilities, Mmapaseka Steve Letsike.\n\nShe said MacGs comments were nauseating in their vulgarity and must be regarded as an unconstitutional violation of Dlaminis rights to freedom and security of the person, equality, and human dignity as enshrined in the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa.\n\nLetsike wanted MacG to be referred to the Parliaments Portfolio Committee, however,this was declined.\n\nI think the majority of members are not in favour of us proceeding as the honorable minister, deputy minister had requested us to do, the committees chairperson Liezl van der Merwe said.\n\nShe pointed out that Dlamini had not approached Parliament nor laid a criminal case.\n\nI think all of you have touched on this point that if we do decide it is our mandate to proceed with hearing one case of cyber-bullying, it would mean that this portfolio committee would have to extend that to every other person because they cannot be selective in choosing one case.\n\nMacG has since apologisedin one his episodes, saying he never intended to offend anyone.\n\nI want to apologise, first and foremost, to all the female chillers, and women in general in SA, I might have offended with that comment. That was not the intention. We never say things to offend people, he said.\n\nI want to extend an invite to Minnie Dlamini to the show. You are more than welcome to come.\n\nThis thing started on the podcastlets end it on the podcast. She said some things, I said some things. Lets squash it once and for all.\n\nDlamini saidshe was hurt and shocked by the commentsmade about her body and personal life on the podcast.\n\nOver the past few weeks, I have watched in disbelief and deep pain as my name, body, and dignity were dragged through the mud of public discourse, she said.\n\nShe described the remarks made by MacG as vile, humiliating, and inexcusable.\n\nDlamini said she is taking legal action to stand up for herself and the dignity of women.\n\n",

The anticipation of his potential debut is palpable, as the young talent looks to make his mark on the world stage.\n\nHailing from Sheffield, with Zimbabwean roots coursing through his veins, Fusire has captured the attention of the Zimbabwean Football Association. This move could see him join a burgeoning roster of UK-based players proudly donning the Zimbabwean jersey, a decision that adds a new chapter to his promising career.\n\nIn an exciting revelation, Marshall Gore, chairperson of the Zimbabwean Football Associations global and diaspora committee, announced the news following a pivotal meeting with Fusire and his father in London. Gore enthusiastically revealed that the midfielder has officially embarked on the process of obtaining a Zimbabwean passport, setting the stage for his international representation.\n\nExciting news!

This includesLuton Towns Marvelous Nakamba, Wolverhampton Wanderers Marshall Munetsi,Brentfords Marley Tavaziva,Cardiff Citys Andy Rinomhota, andMotherwells Tawanda Maswanhise. Together, they form a formidable lineup that promises to bring flair and skill to the international arena.\n\nFusires stint at Carlisle United, which kicked off in January 2025, saw him make 14 appearances under the guidance of managers Mike Williamson and Mark Hughes. Notably, he was a fixture in the clubs final seven matches, where he dazzled fans and staff alike with his performances, leaving a lasting impression on all who watched.\n\nReflecting fondly on his time at Carlisle, Fusire described the experience as representing a great city and great club, underlining the profound impact this loan spell had on his development as a player.\n\n",

Several value chains in the economy are clogged with very costly, repetitive licensing fees, choking the ease of doing business.\n\nEchoing similar sentiments recently, Unifreights CEO, Richard Clarke, bemoaned the exorbitant licensing fees affecting transport sector players in the country.\n\nIn the transport sector specifically, operating costs in Zimbabwe are significantly higher than in neighbouring countries, which continues to squeeze margins. For example, fuel in Zimbabwe remains the most expensive in the region at around US$1,58 per litre, compared to about US$1,01 in Zambia. Vehicle registration and licensing fees are also exorbitantly high at roughly US$1,560 locally versus just US$132 in Zambia, he said.\n\nAdditionally, he said, diesel imports carry heavy duties (approx. USD 0.55 per litre)withexporters being forced to surrender 25% of foreign earnings for conversion into local currency (ZWG), which cannot be freely converted back to US$ at market rates.\n\nClarke said the combination of these challenges, added to currency volatility, liquidity constraints, inflationary pressures and a shortage of long-term financing in the local market, led many businesses to tighten their belts, creating a knock-on effect across supply chains.\n\nThe company said compounding cost pressures is the ongoing liquidity crunch in the banking sector prompting many financial institutions to pull back on lending, forcing companies, including Unifreight and our customers, to rely on shorter-term and more expensive financing.\n\nThese factors make operating a cross-border fleet out of Zimbabwe less attractive and more costly than regional competitors, Clarke said.\n\nMeanwhile, during the period, Unifreight Africa Limited delivered a strong start to 2025, with significant revenue growth in Q1.\n\nTotal revenues for the quarter surged by over 30% compared to the same period last year, reflecting robust demand and the success of recent strategic initiatives. Annual turnover rose from US$20.4 million in 2023 to US$24 million in 2024, and is forecast to reach US$32 million in 2025.\n\n",
