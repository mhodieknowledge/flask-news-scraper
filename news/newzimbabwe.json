            "content": "By BBC News\n\nA FORMER girlfriend of Sean Diddy Combs, testifying for a second day at his criminal trial under the pseudonym Jane, described how she felt pressured to engage in sexual encounters with male escorts while he watched, despite her expressing they upset her.\n\nShe also alleged a network of employees helped procure drugs for the lengthy encounters, known as hotel nights or freak-offs, that left her in pain and with frequent infections.Prosecutors have charged Mr Combs, 55, with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution.He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.At the beginning of the trial, now in its fifth week, defence attorney Teny Geragos said the government had overstepped with its charges and are trying to portray consensual sex between adults as evidence of crimes.With Janes testimony, prosecutors are seeking to provide evidence that the music moguls activities were criminal.In one hotel night encounter in New York in 2023, Jane testified that she invited a male sex worker to fly from Atlanta, Georgia, to New York City to join her and Mr Combs for an encounter at the Trump International Hotel.Jane paid for his ticket, she testified, and afterward, she worked to ensure that an envelope containing several thousand dollars was left for the escort at the front desk.On another occasion, the woman testified that Mr Combss chief of staff Kristina Khorram allegedly instructed her to pick up drugs from Los Angeles to bring to Mr Combs Miami mansion.Ms Khorram has been named by prosecutors in court as a co-conspirator to Mr Combs, and could potentially testify.Sean Diddy Combs: Who is the US rapper accused of sex trafficking?Jane told the court that she picked the package up from a member of Mr Combs security, put it in her check-in luggage and flew to Miami, where she discovered it contained ecstasy.She also said she often saw Mr Combs call his assistants and security to bring drugs to the hotels where they had their encounters with escorts.One of the charges Mr Combs faces is racketeering. In order to prove that, prosecutors have to show that he was running a criminal enterprise and conspiring to commit crimes.Jane testifies about a financial love contractBy the time of the 2023 New York encounter, Jane said she realised she no longer wanted to participate in these hotel nights. The pair had been together since 2021.During the trip, the two began bickering about them and she told Mr Combs she was done with this, she said.Mr Combs was defensive, she said, but told her they didnt have to continue. Still, later that night, she joined him for one.Prosecutors asked the woman several times why she stayed in a relationship with Mr Combs, even as she described feeling disgusted, repulsed after one rare encounter where she did not take drugs, which she said she took to make them seem less real.A federal prosecutor asked why she arranged the hotel night in New York if she had just told Mr Combs she no longer wanted to participate.Jane paused for a long time, at first saying it was hard to answer. She wanted to make her partner happy, she said.Prosecutors introduced the pairs financial ties. At the time, Mr Combs was paying Janes $10,000 per month rent, which he continues to do to this day.Jane testified that the pair made a love contract in which Mr Combs agreed to give her a monthly $10,000 allowance for two years. The rapper would hold the money over her head if she resisted hotel nights, she testified.She said one week, she was planning an all-star party with male escorts from their previous encounters.Mr Combs said he was hyped, but Jane eventually tried to back out. Prosecutors showed the jury texts between the two, where Jane sent photos to prove she was not feeling well.Mr Combs responded with messages she interpreted as threats to cut her off financially.In 2024, near the end of their relationship, Mr Combs told her that he had not known the hotel night encounters upset her and that she had not told him.But in reviewing her messages and notes from their relationship, Jane said she realised she expressed her unhappiness.In one exchange, she told Mr Combs she was upset that he had spent time with another woman after only engaging in a hotel night with her.I need a breather and a break from you, she texted him in November 2021.This doesnt make me feel good at all, your intentions are in plain sight.She also testified on Friday that the hotel nights took a physical toll on her.She told the court that she frequently contracted infections, and felt pelvic pain 100% of the time following the encounters.Jane recalled she probably did not tell Mr Combs about these physical issues because I just didnt want to indicate any negativity, she said.Earlier in the trial, R&B singer Cassandra Cassie Ventura took the witness stand, describing similar drug-fuelled sex encounters with Mr Combs, who she dated for more than a decade.She will continue to face questioning next week, with Mr Combs defence attorneys likely to be grilling her extensively about her time with the rap mogul.\n\nShe also alleged a network of employees helped procure drugs for the lengthy encounters, known as hotel nights or freak-offs, that left her in pain and with frequent infections.\n\nProsecutors have charged Mr Combs, 55, with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution.He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.At the beginning of the trial, now in its fifth week, defence attorney Teny Geragos said the government had overstepped with its charges and are trying to portray consensual sex between adults as evidence of crimes.With Janes testimony, prosecutors are seeking to provide evidence that the music moguls activities were criminal.In one hotel night encounter in New York in 2023, Jane testified that she invited a male sex worker to fly from Atlanta, Georgia, to New York City to join her and Mr Combs for an encounter at the Trump International Hotel.Jane paid for his ticket, she testified, and afterward, she worked to ensure that an envelope containing several thousand dollars was left for the escort at the front desk.On another occasion, the woman testified that Mr Combss chief of staff Kristina Khorram allegedly instructed her to pick up drugs from Los Angeles to bring to Mr Combs Miami mansion.Ms Khorram has been named by prosecutors in court as a co-conspirator to Mr Combs, and could potentially testify.Sean Diddy Combs: Who is the US rapper accused of sex trafficking?Jane told the court that she picked the package up from a member of Mr Combs security, put it in her check-in luggage and flew to Miami, where she discovered it contained ecstasy.She also said she often saw Mr Combs call his assistants and security to bring drugs to the hotels where they had their encounters with escorts.One of the charges Mr Combs faces is racketeering.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA PROMINENT white commercial farmer, Daniel Brink Bosman, is at the centre of controversy after allegedly piercing the skull of a 12-year-old boy with the front-end of a combine harvester, leading to the childs death in 2022.\n\nThe tragedy occurred at Dandreanum farm in Lions Den, on the outskirts of Chinhoyi, Mashonaland West, when the victim, Suarance Moffat, and two other minors were marvelling and cheering on the farmer as he steered the giant machine across his maize field.\n\nAccording to the now deceased boys parents, the farmer, for unknown reasons, drove the harvester towards the children and started chasing them, striking Suarance with a sharp object from the machine.\n\nThe late Suarance, far right in red T-shirt, with his aunt and siblings.\n\nThe bereaved family is convinced that at the time of the incident, Bosman connived with one of his drivers, Douglas Zhanewo to concoct circumstances surrounding the boys death.\n\nThe victims father, Tichaona Moffat, told NewZimbabwe.com that in 2022, after the tragedy, Bosman then proceeded to Murereka Police Station, where he made a false report stating that his tractor driver, Zhanewo, had run over the child.\n\nThe employee was subsequently arrested and appeared in court on a culpable homicide charge. This is despite our vehement denial that our boy had not been run over by a tractor, which weighs so much it could have flattened his body, said Moffat.\n\nInstead, we noticed that there was a deep cut on his head, which was corroborated by the postmortem results. So, this narrative that he had been run over was a blue lie to cover up for murder deliberately committed by Bosman, who chased the minors before killing my son, he added.\n\nMoffat painted a gory picture, as narrated by his other son who witnessed the tragedy, of Suarences body dangling from the fork on the combine harvester bleeding profusely until he died. Thereafter, Moffat further claimed, Bosman instructed a terrified Zhanewo to remove the body which they later dumped near his homestead.\n\nAt the purported scene of the accident, there was no sign of blood at all. This suggests the incident happened elsewhere and the body was dumped where it was found as a broader plot to conceal the murder. Despite raising all these facts, the police are reluctant to arrest Bosman and l strongly suspect money is exchanging hands, said Moffat.\n\nA postmortem conducted by Dr. Ivene Maponga on May 24, 2022, concluded that the boys death resulted from a deep laceration on the head, causing a perforation of the skull.\n\nAs a result, Zhanewo was discharged in 2024 following the conclusion of the State case under Number CHN/CD/1983/24, which established that the deceased had not been run over by a tractor.\n\nThe slain boys family says it has not known peace ever since the unfortunate 2022 incident, which claimed the life of their second-born child.\n\nIn a desperate bid to seek justice,Moffat recently opened a fresh case against Bosman.\n\nThe victims father Tichaona Moffat and mother\n\nAs is tradition, a memorial service should have been held for our murdered son but until now nothing has been done because our boy Suarances soul is not resting. We demand Bosmans immediate arrest so that he is prosecuted as an accused person, not as an informant, said Moffat.\n\nResultantly, police have since opened a murder case against Bosman under CR Number 45/04/25, as well as a case for filing a false report, CR Number 46/04/25.\n\nHowever, Bosman has not yet been arrested.\n\nZimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) Mashonaland West spokesperson, Inspector Ian Kohwera professed ignorance over the case.\n\nThe family, which suspects corruption which also involves National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ) officials, has intensified pressure, through its lawyer Tungamirai Chamutsa of Chamutsa and Partners Legal Practitioners, to have Bosman arrested for murder.\n\nIn a letter to District Public Prosecutor, Herald Matura, officially received on May 15, 2025, the late Suarances father demanded justice to take its course.\n\nOn 11 April 2025 our client reported criminal allegations against the above accused person (Bosman), of murder of his child Suarance Moffat and making a false report as defined in the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act (Chapter 9:23).\n\nStatements were recorded at Murereka Police Station from our client and his son Junior Mephis Moffat (a juvenile) on the same day However, a docket of road traffic culpable homicide was opened wrote the lawyers.\n\nThe same Chinhoyi Traffic police arrested and investigated the wrong person on the same facts under CR28/05/22.\n\nThey arrested and charged Douglas Zhanewo with road traffic culpable homicide despite protestation from our client that his son, Suarance Moffat, was not killed by the tractor which was being driven by Douglas Zhanewo, further argued the lawyers.\n\nOur client reported a case of murder against the accused person, but Chinhoyi Traffic preferred a charge of culpable homicide arising out of a road accident.\n\nFurther, they distilled the original report of the eyewitness Junior Mephis Moffat. Kindly compare the typed statement of the witness dated 9/04/25 and the handwritten statement recorded at Murereka Police Station on 11 April 2025. Key names of participants and vital materials which are in the long-hand statement, are missing in the typed statement.\n\nOur client is baffled by the statement self-recorded by the investigating officer, one Muchihwa Misheck, dated 16 May 2025, a date which we are yet to live and see. In that statement, what is disturbing is the attitude of Mr Muchihwa in which he is discounting the credibility of other witnesses and evidence. This is outside the investigating officers jurisdiction and purview, Chamutsa wrote.\n\nThe lawyers also noted that the wheels of justice are turning slowly.\n\nWe are, therefore, instructed to inform you, as we hereby do, that our client strongly thinks that it is in the interest of justice that the accused Daniel Brink Bosman be charged with the crime of murder as defined in section 47(1) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act Chapter 9:23\n\nThis is said so because there is reasonable suspicion that he killed our clients child, one Suarance Moffat. A prima facie case for the prosecution can be raised, Chamutsa wrote.\n\nWhen contacted for comment on the matter, Bosman refused to shed light on the tragic incident and subsequent allegations raised against him.\n\nI am not at liberty to comment as this matter is still in the courts, Bosman told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\n",

            "content": "By Franny Rabkin l TimesLive\n\nTHE Supreme Court of Appeal has rejected an appeal by the minister of Home Affairs against the Johannesburg High Court order on Zimbabwe Exemption Permits (ZEPs), which give about 180,000 Zimbabweans a special dispensation to lawfully remain in South Africa.\n\nThe judgment also clears the path for the Zimbabwean Immigration Federation to return to court and argue that it is only Parliament, and not the Home Affairs minister, which can decide whether to extend the ZEP regime.In 2023, the Johannesburg High Court set aside a decision by former minister Aaron Motsoaledi to terminate the ZEP regime and to reconsider his decision, following a fair process.The SCAs judgment on Friday said that counsel for the minister told the court that the order is being implemented, and  the minister is following a fair process.But the federation wants to go back to court to argue that ZEP holders and their children enjoy constitutional rights in South Africa. If these are to be limited, only Parliament may do so  by enacting a law of general application, says the SCAs judgment.The SCA did not give a view on whether that argument was correct, but it rejected an appeal by the minister that would have prevented the federation from ever making it.When the High Court gave its order, the federation was one of the parties in the litigation, along with the Helen Suzman Foundation (HSF). Theirs were two separate cases, which were heard together.While the federation and the HSF both wanted similar orders, at that time, from the High Court, their grounds were different. And while the HSF asked the court for a final order, the federation only sought an interim interdict  it wanted to argue its main case at a later date. The court gave a final order, as sought by the HSF, and also the interim interdict sought by the federation.The minister had already tried, and failed, to appeal against the HSF order.In this case, the minister approached the SCA on appeal, saying the interim interdict was redundant since the court had already granted a final order to the HSF.In Fridays judgment, the SCA disagreed. Judge of Appeal David Unterhalter said the federations case raised distinctive grounds of review, which laid the basis for an argument that was not raised or argued earlier  about the powers of the minister when there were constitutional rights at stake.If the federations argument was to be accepted, it would not permit the minister to terminate the ZEP regime.That is a remedial outcome of a considerably more far-reaching kind because it reaches into the future and is not based on a reconsideration, said Unterhalter. The redundancy argument could therefore not hold, he said.\n\nThe judgment also clears the path for the Zimbabwean Immigration Federation to return to court and argue that it is only Parliament, and not the Home Affairs minister, which can decide whether to extend the ZEP regime.\n\nIn 2023, the Johannesburg High Court set aside a decision by former minister Aaron Motsoaledi to terminate the ZEP regime and to reconsider his decision, following a fair process.The SCAs judgment on Friday said that counsel for the minister told the court that the order is being implemented, and  the minister is following a fair process.But the federation wants to go back to court to argue that ZEP holders and their children enjoy constitutional rights in South Africa.

Theirs were two separate cases, which were heard together.While the federation and the HSF both wanted similar orders, at that time, from the High Court, their grounds were different.

in Morocco Friday evening.\n\nZimbabwes senior mens soccer side struggled to keep position in the first few minutes of the game hence helping Burkina Faso to create several chances.Les Etalons managed to score its first goal of the match in the 23rd minute, thanks to Wydad AC midfieder Stephane Aziz Ki, who fired in a far post shot which Zimbabwe goalkeeper Washington Arubi failed to stop.Eager to respond, the Warriors quickly re-organised and created a clear chance, which saw them winning a free kick on the edge of the box after Burkina Faso broke a promising attack by fouling Tawanda Maswanhise.Despite getting the half chance, Zimbabwes effort from the free kick was a disapointment as it was nowhere near a goal.The Warriors were then quickly punished in the 29th minute by Cyrique Irie,.who gave Burkina Faso a comfortable 2-0 lead.Having gone to the break trailing 2-0 Warriors coach Michael Nees made tactical changes in the 63rd minute as he brought in a trio of Tawanda Macheke, Sean Fusire and Daniel Msendami,.who came in for Khama Billiat, Mason Mushore and Maswanhise.However, this did not pay off as Burkina Faso remained resolute at the back hence they got a 2-0 win at the end.Fridays win saw Burkina Faso levelling Zimbabwe on head-to-head wins as they are now both sitting on two out of their five meetings.Warriors now shift focus to their upcoming friendly against Niger this coming Tuesday.\n\nZimbabwes senior mens soccer side struggled to keep position in the first few minutes of the game hence helping Burkina Faso to create several chances.\n\nLes
