Alexandra Park Primary School is a day school.\n\nThe School Development Committee (SDC) chairperson refused to endorse Samanga and Matsengauswas promotions after discovering that the documents were not valid contracts but offer letters masquerading as contracts to legitimise the duos new roles, said a source at the school.\n\nBoth Kundishora and Kwari were summoned by ZACC for questioning.\n\nThis school is suffering because of corruption, added the school source.\n\n",

At first, I was involved in playing games, but all of a sudden I was banished from the first team, I was made to train with the reserves and kicked out of the changing room as well.\n\nIt was a horrible experience, but I will say it helped me to grow, relieved Benyu.\n\nAfter leaving Celtic, Benyu has been nomadic from one club to another, at the same time struggling to adjust.\n\nThe Ipswich academy product had been without a club since July last year, only to resurface at CAPS United.\n\nThe treatment he was given by Rogers at Celtic, Benyu says,was a nightmare he is still trying to recover from.\n\nFor all these years, I have been asking myself the question why he did that to me.\n\nI was not given a reason, and I remember several times I went to his (Rogers) office asking why I was being treated as if I was not liked in the building.\n\nI was ignored all the time I made those efforts, so in the end I accepted and moved on.\n\nUntil now, I always think about it, asking myself what I really did wrong, and I cant think of anything because this is the same team that lured me there at first, said Benyu.\n\nWith five national team caps to his name, Benyu is hoping that he can come back to the local top-flight to recover and regain form.\n\n",

In fact, I am humbled by the confidence and trust that the President has placed in me to lead this important ministry.\n\nIn essence, sports, arts, and culture are powerful tools for national unity, youth empowerment, and economic growth.

During this time, Zanu PF militant youths and war veterans inflicted torture, abductions, and all manner of human rights violations to then MDC supporters.\n\nIn a move that some will undoubtedly view with cynicism, Geza, as one of the war veterans who participated in these heinous crimes with impunity, has now appealed for forgiveness from the opposition community for his past sins, committed alongside his comrades.\n\nGeza attributed his past actions to the fog of war and acknowledged that human rights violations, corruption, and economic mismanagement have led the younger generation to scorn those who fought in the liberation war.\n\nWe are sorry as war veterans. We have let you down. We were being used to assault members of the opposition because we were blinded, he confessed.\n\nGeza concluded: We are now a laughing stock. Young people in this country are telling us as war veterans to return the country in the hands of former colonists. This is being caused by these criminals that we are not reprimanding.\n\nIt has become something of a well-worn trope for Zanu PF outcasts to apologise to the opposition the moment they fall out of favour within their own party.\n\n",

Security personnel launched an investigation, reviewing passenger manifests and conducting physical checks.\n\nIt was discovered that the Ethiopian Airlines manifest had been falsified to misrepresent the Ethiopians as Russians, Turks, and Indians.\n\nFurther checks with National Handling Services revealed another doctored manifest, which listed the Ethiopians as Malawians.\n\nUpon arrival in Eswatini, authorities conducted a physical inspection of Eswatini Airlines flight RN401 and found that the 23 Ethiopians lacked proper transit visas.\n\nThe Ethiopians were arrested, convicted on March 20, 2025, and fined US$100 each or sentenced to three months imprisonment. This development led to a deeper investigation, which implicated the eight airport employees in the smuggling operation.\n\n",

They lost concentration and the motivation to attack. You praise the coach when the tactics work, and you have to blame him when they dont work, he carried on, taking issue with new coach Eric Chelle selecting players out of position.\n\nWATCH | An angry Nigerian man claims that Zimbabwes Warriors have nothing to play for. He made this remark after Zimbabwes draw with Nigeria in the FIFA World Cup qualifiers.pic.twitter.com/Gp2bQWkhAo\n\nWhy dont you play the fullbacks in their natural positions so they can give the strikers the crosses that they need, not forcing [Ola] Aina to cross with his left foot. The left side was the only side that we could have used, but out wingers let us down.\n\nHe carried on: I feel bad for Osimhen. I feel bad for [Calvin] Bassey. I feel back for [Wilfred] Ndidi. I feel bad for [William] Troost-Ekong. I feel bad for [Stanley] Nwabali because they dont deserve this result.\n\nThey worked their a** off. They put the passion, blood, sweat and tears into this team, but yet, some other people just have to get onto their private jets go to their individual clubs and collect their money If they dont qualify for the World Cup, who will pay more? Is it the fans or it it them because the fans are doing their part and the players are not.\n\nWe asked the fans to come fill up the stadium and they did. We asked them to shout and sing, and they did. All we asked [from them] is a win. And were not asking for it against hard competition. This is frikkin Zimbabwe. They are not qualifying for the World Cup. They are not playing for anything. You are paying for everything. Where was that spirit?\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Republic Polices (ZRP) Officer Commanding Harare district, Chief Superintendent Michael Masvivi, has from today, imposed a two-month prohibition order against the carrying of any possible weapons, just three days before planned national protests.\n\nLed by war veteran Blessed Bombshell Geza, the protests have been set for March 31.\n\nTheir primary purpose is to force the ouster of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is being accused of engaging with and harbouring a string of corrupt individuals who have not only captured the state but also been milking it dry.\n\nMasvivi specifically highlights that any items capable of use as weapons, catapults, machetes, knobkerries, axes, swords, knives or daggers can no longer be carried, whether publicly or concealed, and they can also not be displayed.\n\nAny traditional weapons whatsoever likely to occasion public disorder or a breach of the peace, (I) hereby issue an order prohibiting the carrying of such weapons in Harare District or any part thereof for a period not exceeding two months, that is from March 27, to May 31, reads Masvivis statement.\n\nMasvivi claims his decision is based on Section 13 of the Maintenance of Peace and Order Act (MOPA) which he further asserts sets six months  imprisonment or a fine as punishment for breaching the order, which it does not.\n\nState security forces, including the police and Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) have been put on high alert ahead of the planned demonstrations.\n\nDespite the absence of any sure sign that Zimbabweans will heed Gezas call to cut short Mnangagwas presidential term, the countrys poverty levels, uncontrolled corruption, little to no investment in the poor masses health sector and extravagance by those close to the President are all factors that are fast angering millions.\n\nFactional fights between Mnangagwa and his deputy Constantino Chiwenga have also unsettled Zanu PF ahead of the protest, considering the two led an almost similar exercise to topple then President Robert Mugabe in 2017.\n\n",
