            "content": "The Department of Employment and Labour (DEL) has slapped 38 employers with fines amounting to R68 000 for hiring illegal foreign nationals without valid work permits in contravention of immigration laws.\n\nIn a parliamentary reply, Minister Nomakhosazana Meth said her department conducts blitz inspections in collaboration with the Department of Home Affairs and the police.\n\nMeth said her departments mandate was to enforce the implementation of labour laws to ensure the protection of workers, while the Department of Home Affairs scrutinised the validity of visas and work permits through the application of immigration laws.\n\nIn the event of non-compliance with immigration laws, the Department of Home Affairs arrests the non-compliant employers and employees.\n\nMeth said during the blitz, 68 employers and 322 foreign nationals were found on the wrong side of the law across the nine provinces.\n\nWith respect to the 68 employers arrested, each employer paid an admission of guilt fine to the amount of R10 000. Therefore, the total amount paid in lieu of fines is R680 000 while the 322 employees were taken for further processing as per immigration requirements, she said.\n\nMeths response showed that Eastern Cape led the pack with 34 employers that flouted the laws and were fined a collective R340 000, followed by Mpumalanga with 15, Limpopo eight, KwaZulu-Natal five, and two in the Western Cape.\n\nShe also said of the 322 foreign employees that were arrested, the largest number, 163, were from Limpopo.\n\nThe Western Cape came second with foreign nationals at 43, Eastern Cape and Gauteng at 34 each, Mpumalanga 30, KwaZulu-Natal 16, and Free State two.\n\nIn a separate response to another set of questions, Meth said her department received 6 255 work permit applications between April 2023 and March last year.\n\nShe said the role of her department was to make recommendations on corporate work visa applications regarding the availability of local labour in various categories.\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs makes final decisions or waive any recommendation made by any of these three departments after following their final internal processes or after consulting further with other departments such as those in the security cluster.\n\nShe added that of the 60 corporate applications her department received and processed, 5 383 were rejected.\n\nA total of 872 work visas for migrant workers were recommended.\n\nThe applications were mainly from foreign nations from Zimbabwe with 445, Lesotho with 250, Mozambique 86, and Namibia 70.\n\nThe applications were for mining, agriculture, and education and training.\n\n",

We produced and paid, but we have now reached a point where we can no longer sustain it.\n\nIn addition to suspending the Lisbon route, LAM also canceled flights between Maputo and Harare, Zimbabwe, and between Maputo and Lusaka, Zambia, due to the same reason.\n\nFor the 1,080 passengers who had already purchased tickets for the flights, Cossa said, LAM will make alternative travel arrangements through agreements with other operators.\n\nOnce we have restructured and consolidated our position, we will look toward intercontinental and regional operations, the spokesperson added.\n\nThe decision to suspend international routes aligns with LAMs 100-Day Governance Plan, which seeks to assess operational performance and strengthen the quality of domestic and regional services, Cossa said.\n\nFor years, LAM has struggled with operational challenges, including a reduced fleet, lack of investment, and non-fatal incidents linked to poor aircraft maintenance.\n\nIn February, the Mozambican government approved the sale of a 91 percent state-owned stake in LAM to public companies, aiming to raise 130 million dollars for the acquisition of eight new aircraft and the airlines restructuring.\n\n",

These internal divisions have spilled into the public domain, fracturing the ruling party.\n\nSeveral government ministers, including Jenfan Muswere, Daniel Garwe, and Tinoda Machakaire, are among those backing the move to disregard the constitution by allowing Mnangagwa to remain in power until 2030.\n\nIn a recent sermon, Angel who is theAmbassador at Large to Europe and the Americas, condemned the calls by these cabinet ministers, describing them as retrogressive and damaging to Mnangagwas reputation.\n\nWe should be talking about targets for this road. Target next week. Target next week for this one. Target next week for that hospital. Target next week for this one.\n\nIf the president has already said he is not interested in [extending his term], focus on when we are putting a road here. Some of these politicians are the ones that give good people bad names because they party at night, but we, the public, get the hangover.\n\nYou dont have a place to stay. People are arguing over stupid things. Is it 2030? Is it 2033? Is it 2024? Shut up. Lets just do the work. I normally dont comment on this.\n\nWhy do you speak for the man who has already said, Im not going there. Im not interested in that? Just do your thing, said Angel.\n\nAngel made headlines in 2023 following the release of Al Jazeeras Gold Mafia documentary which exposed him as a key player in the money laundering and gold smuggling syndicate. In the expos he offered to assist undercover journalists pretending to be Chinese gangsters with money to launder.\n\nI look at the political dialogue in this country, where people are fighting. They are fighting. Who said hes going to 2030? Who said hes going to 2018? Who said hes going until 2033? From both sides, something is wrong, he added.\n\nWhile Muswere, Garwe, and Machakaire have been vocal in their push for the term extension, their performances in their respective ministerial roles have come under scrutiny for delivering lacklustre results.\n\nTheir calls also contradict Mnangagwas public declaration that he will not run for the presidency in the next elections, scheduled for 2028.\n\nHowever, Mnangagwas refusal has been questioned, as he has not publicly rebuked the faction aligned with him.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nHARARE Mayor Jacob Mafume has exposed a can of worms regarding how Council executives embezzled over US$1 million to purchase the latest vehicles in an inexplicable scheme.\n\nMafume made these revelations on Tuesday as he concluded his testimony before the Commission of Inquiry, which is investigating the operations of the Harare City Council.\n\nIn 2023, the Harare City Council (HCC) executive, led by the then Town Clerk Hosiah Chisango, purchased Toyota Fortuners using remittances from Harare City Parka subsidiary of the HCC.\n\nMafume revealed that the vehicles are being used by top officials, and no action has been taken to explain the purchase, which was made without the Councils approval.\n\nThat is one of the biggest challenges because last year City Parking brought to the City Council about a million. When we started asking where that US$1 million went that is where the problem began and I am told that the US$1 million was used to purchase executive cars or Fortuners and so forth, said Mafume.\n\nMafume told the Commission, led by retired Justice Maphios Cheda, that the purchase of the top-of-the-range vehicles was made when the Council was dissolved before the elections.\n\nIt happened towards 2023. Towards the elections. City Parking used to enforce one by-law which is the parking by-law then we made a resolution for them to enforce another by-law to give them two.\n\nThe sharing of the revenue was that they collect the revenue and we get 50 percent of that. Now because it was the first time they implemented that by-law, it raised US$2 million and the US$1 million was then remitted to the City Council.\n\nWe were going to the elections and the City Council dissolved. When we came back we said what happened with that US$1 million because we had earmarked it for doing the parking and all that. We were told that it was used. What it was used for and how it was used and we then learnt that purchases of vehicles for the Executives had been done in the time whilst we had the electioneering, he said.\n\nThe chaos currently reigning at the Town House has been attributed to the lack of a functioning Electronic Resource Planning (ERP) system.\n\nThe absence of an ERP system has resulted in financial mismanagement and unaccounted leakages of funds by the City Council.\n\nThe Commission of Inquirys evidence leader, Thabani Mpofu, revealed that executives at the Council are spending US$125,000 per year on holidays. The Town Clerk is entitled to one international trip per year, while other executives are entitled to a regional trip.\n\nThese holidays are paid for using ratepayers money, which the Council has claimed it does not have, hence the poor service delivery in the city.\n\nWhen questioned about the astronomical figures, Mafume professed ignorance, stating that he was shocked by the amounts.\n\nFrom the figures, I will have no right to dispute those figures they do not come through me. I have no access to that. I am actually shocked at the figures and the information because they come at a time when we as Councillors are being asked and everybody is being asked to tighten their belts. Others are loosening, said Mafume.\n\nMeanwhile, the Commission of Inquiry has completed its public hearings. The Commission will compile a report, which will be presented to President Emmerson Mnangagwa upon finalisation.\n\n",

This is no longer realisable due to challenges associated with the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic and fluctuation in funding from the international donor community.\n\nAs a result, we are working on submitting another three-year extension request to the Secretariat of the Treaty.\n\nThe funding gap as at September 2024 and completion of mine clearance in Zimbabwe by 2028 was US$23.79 million. Muchinguri said.\n\nShe addedthatthe government will keep funding the demining project.\n\nOn its part, the Government of Zimbabwe will continue to fund the National Mine Clearance Unit which requires a minimum of US$2,000,000 per year.\n\nIt is our hope that deliberations during this workshop will help unlock funding for mine action in Zimbabwe as completion of mine clearance hinged on sustained funding from the government and current and new donors.\n\nCompletion of mine clearance in Zimbabwe will not only help enhance safety and security in affected communities but will also go a long way in unlocking sustainable socio-economic development, she added.\n\nSince 1980, landmines have killed or injured over 1,500 people, while more than 120,000 livestock have also died as a result.\n\nThese minefields are in six provincesMatabeleland North, Mashonaland West, Mashonaland Central, Mashonaland East, Manicaland, and Masvingocovering 310,650 square kilometers.\n\n",

The shadow economy is also enjoying easy access to foreign currency and tax evasions.\n\nIn a bid to ease informalisation of the sector, Finance Minister, Mthuli Ncube this week recommended a raft of measures which include the adoption of e-money and use of bank accounts for all businesses.\n\nBut speaking to NewZimbabwe.com, CWUZ General Secretary, Cuthbert Chikwekwete implored the government to consider compelling the informal sector to abide by appropriate labour standards if formalization is to subsist.\n\nThe formalization agenda cannot be complete if players in the shadow economy are not compelled to follow the retail sectors set standards. These tuck shop owners continue to enjoy easy operating conditions such as underemployment where they hire two or three employees and overwhelm them with mammoth tasks. Their employees are often not allowed to join trade unions and most of the business owners resist becoming a part and parcel of the National Employment Council, he said.\n\nThe workers leader also criticized the informal sector for subjecting short-staffed workers to long hours of work with poor remuneration.\n\nOne would note that at a time when OK Zimbabwe and Spar entities are contributing immensely to fiscus through Pay As You Earn (PAYE), the informal sector which creams off a huge chunk of the retail sectors profits is not injecting anything at all. The revenue leakages through the sector could be larger than anticipated, he said.\n\nChikwekwete added that there is an urgent need for the government to join hands and compel all informal players to contribute towards the fiscus and Social Protection of their workers as the nation journeys towards formalization.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) has implored the government to scrap the current set-up of two examination boards for Ordinary and Advanced Level students arguing that this is increasing inequalities among learners.\n\nStudents in the country can sit for their examinations under the Zimbabwe Schools Examinations Council (ZIMSEC) board while those who can afford can opt for the University of Cambridge exams board.\n\nHowever, the teachers group contends that some learners have enjoyed the prestige of the foreign examinations board, diminishing the value of equality in education.\n\nARTUZ reiterates its demand for a single examination board that serves all candidates, regardless of their socioeconomic status. The current system, which favours elites who can afford Cambridge examinations, is discriminatory and perpetuates inequality.\n\nIt is deeply concerning that duty bearers, including government officials, continue to neglect ZIMSEC while their own children sit for Cambridge examinations, the union said.\n\nIn the wake of ZIMSEC exam registrations, the teachers group bemoaned chronic underfunding of the local exams body and called for the urgent availing of resources by the government.\n\nThe teachers union castigated ZIMSECs higher fees for private candidates saying they are unjust and exploitative and warned that the excess funds collected from private candidates are likely to be lost to corruption, further undermining the integrity of the examination system.\n\nThe lobby group said the gazetted US$11 and US$24 to be paid subject to payment by O and ALevel students is way beyond affordability and brings to question whether the governments subsidies towards basic education still exist.\n\n The governments claim of covering 55% of the fees is a fabrication designed to create the illusion of support while shifting the burden onto parents and guardians, added ARTUZ.\n\n",
