I am confident that this renewed partnership will enhance the quality of education and professional practice in social work, ultimately benefiting our society as a whole, added Moyo.\n\n",

Cde Geza was among the conference delegates who lobbied for that resolution to be passed.\n\nTherefore, it is surprising that today he is turning his back on a resolution he helped create. It is unfortunate that the bitterness he suffered from the 2018 primary election defeat is now causing him to go as far as rewriting the history of the President, said Muswere.\n\nThe lnformation minister claims Gezas statement was surprising, especially considering that the Second Republic respects war veterans.\n\nThis sense of self-contradiction and hypocrisy goes against the principles of basic honesty we expect from senior citizens and genuine war veterans.\n\nThis charade is very disappointing considering the magnitude of economic transformation that Zimbabwe has enjoyed under the leadership of the President His Excellency Cde Dr Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa.\n\nSection 84 of the Constitution of Zimbabwe obliges all State institutions and progressive Zimbabweans to recognise Rights of Veterans of the Liberation Struggle.\n\nThese architects of our national liberation include those who fought in the War of Liberation; the virtuous gallant Sons and Daughters of the Soil who assisted the fighters in the war of liberation; and anti-colonial visionaries who were imprisoned, detained and restricted for political reasons during the liberation struggle. Through their unflinching resolve, independent Zimbabwe was born.\n\nPursuant to this clear constitutional position, the Second Republic, under the revolutionary leadership of the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, His Excellency Cde Dr E.D. Mnangagwa has championed a deliberate welfare support for the veterans of the liberation struggle, said Muswere.\n\nWar veterans, Muswere added, were recognised by establishing a stand-alone ministry to cater for their welfare. Zanu PF has also set up a parallel wing of ex-freedom fighters.\n\nThis, Muswere claimed, was to ensure the total inclusion and participation of veterans of the liberation struggle in the economy.\n\nThe actualisation of this constitutional recognition of this important class of distinguished patriots has been facilitated by the establishment of a standalone ministry which caters for the socio-economic needs of veterans of the liberation struggle.\n\nFor the first time, four decades after the attainment of Zimbabwes independence, the Second Republic strengthened the constitutional recognition of the veterans of the liberation struggle by ensuring that the ruling Zanu PF now has a stand-alone War Veterans Wing, said Muswere, adding Mnangagwa had championed over 8,000 developmental projects since assuming office in 2017.\n\n",

Back then it could import 12 million litres duty-free and the extension to 2026 allows it an additional 1.95 million litres.\n\nMoti made headlines in 2023 after an independent investigation exposed a US$120 million chrome scandal involving President Emmerson Mnangagwa, his deputy Constantino Chiwenga and local tycoon Kuda Tagwireyi.\n\nAccording to the investigation by the Sentry organisation, the deal was struck on November 17, 2017, during the week-long coup that brought President Mnangagwa and Vice President Chiwenga to power. The Sentry is an investigative and policy organization that seeks to disable multinational predatory networks that benefit from violent conflict, repression, and kleptocracy.\n\nThe report made revelations that Moti paid $3 million to firms linked to Mnangagwa and Chiwenga following the signing of the chrome deal.\n\nKnown for his addiction to fast cars and cigars, Moti, dabbled in property development and private jets, but his main business in Zimbabwe was processing chrome.1 In 2014 he bought 70% of African Chrome Fields (ACF) and in 2015 applied for national project status which was granted that same year.\n\nRELATED:\n\nThe notice on the duty waiver was rubber-stamped by the Finance and Investment Promotion Minister, Mthuli Ncube under the countrys Customs regulations.\n\nIt is hereby notified that the Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion has in terms of Section 235 as read with Section 120 of the Customs and Excise Act made the following regulations.\n\nThe Customs and Excise Suspension Regulations, 2003, published in SI 257 of 2003 are amended in section 9 BB as follows- in subsection 2 by the deletion of the words 1stJanuary 2023 to 21stJanuary 2024 and substitution with the words 1stJanuary 2025 to 21stJanuary 2026; approved beneficiary of power generation projects eligible for suspension of duty, read SI6 of 2025.\n\nThe development comes at a time when the Civil Society has castigated some Chrome miners for leaving behind a trail of destruction after tapping into the countrys underneath.\n\nZimbabwe is home to some 19% of global chrome ore reserves  the second largest in the world. Its chrome store is also of a higher grade than other international sources, with an exceptional chrome-to-iron ratio of 2:1.\n\n",
