This has also ensured the full coverage of the total ZiG deposits in the economy of around ZiG13 billion, thereby supporting the Reserve Banks currency and exchange rate stability objectives, RBZ governor, John Mushayavanhu said.\n\nThe central bank said the reserves accumulation strategy is centred on ensuring that, at any point, the ZiG component of reserve money is fully backed.\n\nBased on the current trends of foreign exchange inflows, including in-kind royalties, the RBZ believes the reserve accumulation strategy for 2025 will result in a significant improvement in foreign reserve holdings at the Reserve Bank.\n\n",

Thank you for understanding, the notice states.\n\nPrEP is a medication that can help reduce your risk of contracting HIV through sexual contact.\n\nSome officials confirmed that testing services are the only offerings at this time.\n\nThe clinic is only open for those who want to be tested for HIV. We are currently not offering other services, officials at the reception explained.\n\nA similar situation is being reported in Masvingo.\n\nThe centre has typically provided integrated clinical services that included HIV testing, PrEP, TB screening and treatment, cervical cancer screening and treatment, as well as short-term and long-acting reversible contraceptives, and sexually transmitted infection (STI) screening and treatment, among other services.\n\nUpon his inauguration, Trump announced a range of changes to the United States funding model, emphasizing reasonable use of taxpayers money and prioritizing developments within the superpower itself.\n\nThis policy shift has led to millions of US dollars in funding being paused for local civil society organizations (CSOs), impacting billions globally.\n\nGiven that the United States is a significant funder of development in both the health and education sectors of Zimbabwe, there are growing concerns regarding the potential ramifications of these changes.\n\nThe US plays a crucial role in Zimbabwes efforts to combat sexually transmitted diseases and HIV, with PEPFAR providing funding for the majority of condoms and antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) distributed by local hospitals.\n\nCurrently, approximately 1.2 million Zimbabweans benefit from PEPFAR, and over 1,600 public hospitals and clinics have received training and technical support from the US government.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nHarare Mayor Jacob Mafume has pointed the finger at his wife in the growing controversy surrounding a luxury hostel inspection report he is building in Belvedere. Mafume told the retired High Court Judge Justice Maphios Cheda-led Commission of Inquiry today that his wife is overseeing the construction of the hostel intended to accommodate over 60 Harare Institute of Technology (HIT) students.\n\nThe property, allegedly acquired through kickbacks from South African firm Quill Associates (involved in Harare City Councils Enterprise Resource Plan), was reportedly built without adhering to council regulations regarding planning and inspection.\n\nMafume presented the commission with an inspection report showing six visits to the property in a single month, sometimes just three days apart, all seemingly documented with the same pen.\n\nTapiwa Fresh Godzi, leading the commissions evidence, questioned the speed of construction. I wonder at what rate the builders are working. Inspection after inspection every three days. Is that reasonable? he asked.Mafume maintained it was reasonable.\n\nCommission chairperson Justice Cheda inquired about the identity of the inspector. Mafume admitted he had never met the person face to face.\n\nThese people approving this building all have the same signature, correct? Justice Cheda asked. Mafume confirmed this and again, implicated his wife in the inspection furore.\n\nI have not met the inspector personally. They visit the site where there is a contractor. This is being handled by my wife, he stated.\n\nNewZimbabwe.com has learned that the City Council has no record of Mafume paying for any of the six inspections he presented to the commission. Sources say Mafume himself lacks receipts to prove payment.\n\nPayment is required for each inspection stage by city officials. Mafume made no payments and has no proof of payment for any of the inspections, a source stated.\n\nDuring his testimony, Mafume admitted he had not obtained council approval to change the propertys use from residential to commercial. Such changes require approval from the works and town planning committee, but Mafume made no application, and no committee meeting minutes exist approving the renovations.\n\nThe change of use plan does not exist. That one is not there, said a noticeably nervous Mafume.\n\nChange-of-use plans are typically paid for before construction begins.\n\nA typical building plan for the hostel Mafume is building costs around United States Dollars three thousand, which he has not paid to the council, a source said.\n\nThis represents a violation of by-laws that Mafume, as Harares mayor, is expected to uphold.\n\nAnother source claims Mafume used intermediaries to handle the hostel construction and the purchase of a Greendale mansion, avoiding direct involvement.\n\nThis, the source believes, was a strategy to evade scrutiny, but his shady deals have now come back to haunt him.\n\n",

Chatora expressed satisfaction with his resilience after the early mistakes, acknowledging the difficulty of the course and his ability to stay focused.\n\nJack Buchanan, who shared a match with Chatora, had a strong round of his own, finishing two shots behind with a five-under-par 67. The South African began with an eagle on the second hole and added two more birdies on the front nine.\n\nAlthough he made some mistakes, including a bogey on the 14th, he remained composed and birdied the final hole. Buchanans round was filled with highlights, including an eagle from 25 feet on the second, and he praised his ability to maintain focus despite his setbacks.\n\nIn the Africa Amateur Womens Invitational, South Africas Lisa Coetzer surged ahead with a two-stroke lead, posting a two-under-par 70. Despite a double-bogey on the 18th, Coetzer displayed remarkable poise throughout the round, especially on the back nine where she made three birdies.\n\nThe 14-year-old, who had three birdies on the front nine as well, managed the challenging conditions well and showed maturity beyond her years. Meanwhile, Bobbi Brown and Gia Raad shared second place, with Brown having made a strong comeback from a triple-bogey on the eighth.\n\nOther standout performances came from Kenyas Michael Karanga, who eagled the 18th to finish at four-under-par, and South African Johndre Ludick, who carded a solid 68. Ludick, who had a recent strong finish at the GolfRSA International Amateur Championship, played bogey-free golf until the final hole.\n\nThe tournament, which offers prestigious exemptions for the winner, including entry to The Open at Royal Portrush, is shaping up to be a competitive event with many rising stars ready to challenge the leaders.\n\n",

However, the money was blown withno traceablepaper trail.\n\nMayor Jacob Mafume made the startling disclosure to the retired Justice Maphios Cheda-led Commission of Inquiry Thursday as he continued with his testimony.\n\nThe money was stolen, Mafume said bluntly.\n\nWhen pressed by Cheda on who was responsible for the theft and what measures had been taken to investigate the missing funds he replied: The management of Quarry. We resolved to get the Police involved. What we did is, we instituted, what was done before we were elected as Councillors. This was done by the previous Council and the previous management.\n\nWe were elected in 2018. The money was stolen, I am trying to think when the loan was advanced. I am not too sure.\n\nHarare Quarry, one of theCity Councils subsidiaries, has become a hub of corruption, with top officials allegedly exploiting it for personal gain.\n\nThe company has also not been remitting funds to the City Council despite its premises being leased to private companies.\n\nMafume acknowledged that the company has been a financial burden to the Council requiring constant bailouts.\n\nI am very passionate about that US$4 million because that US$4 million is the one that has caused us to have differences with the management that was there. I have pursued it in different Council meetings. I have taken the actions within my power.\n\nAs of current, because the properties are being constantly attached, I have suggested that the entity be put under management or what we used to call liquidation.
