Its a hard pill to swallow.\n\nHorrific killing\n\nSentencing Zivanai to life in prison, Judge William Hart said: You were angry and aggressive, and she was cowed by your behaviour.\n\nYou appear to have become convinced that she was in some form of relationship, perhaps an affair, with another man.\n\nThat was, as far as the evidence indicates, a wholly groundless suspicion and that form of jealousy appears to have been a feature of much of your relationship.\n\nThe circumstances of this poor young womans killing were horrific, he added.\n\n",

Some have been turned into tuck shops by informal traders.\n\nMafume acknowledged before the commission that the council has not been benefitting.\n\nCouncil is not benefiting from that state of affairs. They are not being run properly. The absence an ERP, we need a software to manage the various leases and properties that are owned by the council and there was a deliberate effort from management not to put these properties of Council into a system package, companies like Old Mutual and Real Estates companies use it, said Mafume.\n\nWithout disclosing the exact number, Mafume told the commission that there are properties that have disappeared from the radar of the local authority.\n\nYou cannot transfer it to where there is equal chaos because if you transfer its without the reforms there are more properties that are supposed to be managed by CoH that are disappearing and not being managed well, he said.\n\nCouncil has lost control of some its buildings after being grabbed by barons, who now demand rentals from shop owners.\n\nLast year, the commission revealed that the council collected US$100 in the first quarter of 2024 from tuckshop owners, exposing leakages and deep corruption within the municipality.\n\nMafume acknowledged that a Citizens for Change (CCC) councillor leases a property from Rufaro Marketing.\n\nI am not aware of any councillor beyond the one that was revealed, Hunters. At the present moment, I know of one councillor who was linked to Hunters Bar. It was publicised that Councillor Nyakudya was leasing, said Mafume.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZANU PF politburo member Ziyambi Ziyambi has jumped to President Emmerson Mnangagwas defence amid growing calls, from within the party, for him to rip apart Zimbabwes constitution and extend his term to 2030.\n\nZiyambi, who was speaking to ruling party members in Mashonaland West province said the calls should not be associated with Mnangagwa but with the entire Zanu PF which wants him to stay.\n\nHe said they were the ones pushing for extension and constitutional amendments necessary to ensure Mnangagwa possibly replicates late President Robert Mugabes lengthy stay in office.\n\nZiyambi becomes the third top official in both government and Zanu PF to jump to Mnangagwas defence in recent days as factional battles within the ruling party heat up.\n\nAt no time did President Mnangagwa say he wants this or that, about the issue of 2030, said Ziyambi.\n\nIt is us as the people and general membership of Zanu PF who expressed our desire about what we want him to do.\n\nNow if you hear someone saying anything about our President that he has done this or he intends to do that, tell them that it is not him, but it is us as the people and as Zanu PF. He is not in the equation or this discourse.\n\nZiyambis comment comes days after Information Minister Jenfan Muswere said the same in a statement released hours after Mnangagwas spokesperson George Charamba shared similar sentiments.\n\nBoth are regarded as Mnangagwa loyalists.\n\nThe politically broad-based call to extend the Presidential term of office beyond 2028 remains a rightful and unquestionable obligation for Parliament, the Party of Zimbabwes permanent national democratic revolution -ZANU PF and other legitimate political stakeholders to this matter, said Muswere in a statement.\n\nThose loyal to Mnangagwas deputy Constantino Chiwenga are reportedly grouping to ensure the formerdoes not extend his term.\n\nHe needs to amend theConstitution twice so as to entertain hopes of hanging on.\n\nCharamba said Mnangagwa as President will not tamper with views expressed by people as that right was enshrined in Zimbabwes constitution.\n\nHis comments came after local daily newspaper NewsDay carried a story on leaders of the Zimbabwe Heads of Christian Denominations (ZHOCD) urging Mnangagwa to respect the 2013 constitution and step aside in 2028 when his second term ends.\n\nThe designated role of the President of Zimbabwe in such situations is not to tamper with expressions of viewpoints from the citizenry; rather, it is to allow those viewpoints free play for as long as they remain within the remit of our Constitution, said Charamba.\n\nMnangagwas home province, Masvingo, was the first to urge him to hang on before other provinces and leagues jumped onto the bandwagon.\n\nDespite distancing himself at the partys last Peoples Conference, Mnangagwas allies have continued to push for the move.\n\n",
