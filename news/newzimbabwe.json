Bumper-to-bumper traffic had delayed her car journey to Ahmedabad airport  so much so that she missed her Air India flight to London Gatwick by just 10 minutes.\n\nMs Chauhan, a business administration student who lives in Bristol with her husband, had been visiting western India for a holiday.The 28-year-old was due to fly home on AI171 on Thursday, which crashed shortly after take-off, killing 241 people on board and more on the ground.But after arriving at the airport less than an hour before departure, airline staff turned her away.We got very angry with our driver and left the airport in frustration, she recalls. I was very disappointed.We left the airport and stood at a place to drink tea and after a while, before leaving we were talking to the travel agent about how to get a refund for the ticket.There, I got a call that the plane had gone down.Speaking to the BBCs Gujarati service, she adds: This is totally a miracle for me.Ms Chauhan says she arrived at the airport at 12:20 PM local time, 10 minutes after boarding was due to commence.Her digital boarding pass, seen by BBC News, shows her assigned to economy class seat 36G.But despite having checked in online, she says airline staff would not allow her to complete the process at the airport.She had travelled from Ankleshwar  201km (125 miles) south of Ahmedabad  before being held up in Ahmedabads city centre traffic.Ms Chauhan says: When I missed the flight, I was dejected.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nPRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa has claimed a shared history with the late former Zambian President Edgar Lungu, asserting they were contemporaries at law school.\n\nSpeaking at the Zambian Embassy on Thursday, where he signed the Book of Condolences following Lungus passing, Mnangagwa insisted on a connection stretching back to his student days.\n\nWe were students together at law school. There is a lot of history between me and him and several other Zambians, I did my education in Zambia, of course he was junior, Mnangagwa stated.\n\nHowever, this assertion has been met with scepticism, with critics quick to point to what they perceive as a series of legal missteps made by the President since assuming office in November 2017.\n\nThese alleged blunders have fuelled doubts about the extent of Mnangagwas legal knowledge and background.\n\nExamples cited include early constitutional gaffes, such as ministerial appointments made outside the bounds of Parliament. The public was obliged to remind him of his overreach, forcing him to rescind his decisions.\n\nFurther scrutiny arose when, during the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland, in 2018, Mnangagwa appeared to announce the 2018 elections for May, a date predating the constitutional earliest possible polling day of July 23, 2018.\n\nAdding fuel to the fire, shortly after taking office, Mnangagwa issued an ultimatum to those accused of externalising US dollars and assets, demanding they return the loot or face prosecution. This was despite the absence of any Zimbabwean law criminalising such activity at the time, a move widely interpreted as a significant oversight.\n\nThese early missteps have left many questioning the Presidents legal prowess.\n\nDespite the Presidents assertion, critics remain unconvinced. They point to a lack of tangible evidence, noting the absence of photographs or verifiable accounts from alleged classmates to support the claim of a shared legal education.\n\nThe claim, they argue, rests solely on Mnangagwas oral tradition.\n\nDespite the controversy, Mnangagwa further described Lungu as a leader of foresight in terms of development and said his passing represented a significant loss not only for Zambia but for the region as a whole.\n\nWe have lost one of our illustrious leaders he was committed not only to Zambia but to the rest of the region he was one of us he was a man who had foresight in terms of development and collaboration between several countries, he said.\n\nLungu lost the Zambian elections to Hakainde Hichilema in August 2021.\n\nHe has since reportedly enjoyed a close relationship with Zanu PF, with some suggesting Mnangagwas party was funding a potential comeback bid in Zambias 2026 elections, a claim both parties vehemently denied.\n\n",
