The fund draws its capital from balance-of-payments surpluses, foreign currency operations, privatisation proceeds, fiscal savings, and natural resource revenues.\n\nIn an update this week, Mutapa Fund CEO Dr. John Mangudya said the latest funding marks significant progress in efforts to restructure and strengthen the performance of critical SOEs.\n\nThis funding is designed to enhance the performance of parastatals and align them with the national economic agenda, said Dr. Mangudya. Among the entities benefiting from this support are the Cold Storage Company (CSC), which recently emerged from corporate rescue, ZUPCO, Silo Foods, and the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ), among others.\n\nSince its inception, the Mutapa Fund has played a central role in revitalising distressed parastatals, particularly by steering the CSC out of corporate rescue and improving governance and operational efficiency across several other enterprises.\n\nThe fund manages a diversified portfolio of state-owned companies, grouped into key economic clusters, including mineral resources, energy and trading, ICT, transport and logistics, agriculture and industry, financial services, and real estate.\n\nThrough these targeted investments, the Mutapa Investment Fund continues to anchor Zimbabwes broader strategy for state enterprise reform, economic stability, and sustainable growth.\n\n",

He reportedly approached a security officer manning the main gate and suddenly attempted to snatch his SKS rifle while shouting, Where is ED? I want to see ED.\n\nA scuffle ensued as the guard wrestled with Ruvheneko before another officer, Private Mupfumira, intervened to subdue him. During the struggle, the accused was injured on his left hand by the bayonet attached to the firearm.\n\nThe accused was arrested while in the process of committing the offence, and there are eyewitnesses who will testify linking him to the crime, the State told the court.\n\nHe was later taken to Five Avenue Police Station, where a report was filed. The State opposed bail, arguing that Ruvheneko has no known address or relatives and may interfere with witnesses if released.\n\n",
