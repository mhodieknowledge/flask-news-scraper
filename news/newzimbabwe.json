            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com has invited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner atMadzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal)to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans living in the diaspora. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima and compliments of the new season, we want to continue our discussion on Immigration Law, specifically focusing on foreign Visa applications which we understand you can also assist people with. What are the common requirements in Visa applications to foreign destinations from Zimbabwe?\n\nVM: Compliments of the new season.\n\nGenerally, most preferred destinations for Zimbabweans that require visas before entry commonly require the applicants to possess a passport valid for at least 6 months beyond the intended stay. Applicants are naturally required to complete application forms which will list the varying requirements of the country of interest. These requirements commonly include passport-sized photos, proof of financial means, your bank statement or sponsorship letterset ceteraand invitation letters or hotel bookings for tourists.\n\nReporter: What are the common red flags for visa denial in Zimbabwe\n\nVM: The issue of red flags has to be analyzed in totality. Zimbabwe was and to an extent remains under sanctions as some members of its leadership are still under sanctions. I say this intentionally because our visa applications are looked at carefully as a result of this background.\n\nFurther, a lot of our citizens left Zimbabwe to seek greener pastures under different guises in their applications which has a bearing on current and future applications to visa-requiring countries.\n\nThis has to be balanced against the visa officers duty to protect his or her country against undesirables when considering your application.\n\nIt therefore behoves an applicant to be circumspect when drafting applications. You cannot have incomplete applications with missing information, documents or inconsistencies. Your proof of financial means should align with your intended purpose of visit, where it raises suspicion, such visas are generally denied.\n\nIt is important to understand that the visa application is considered as a whole, so your reason for the visit, previous immigration violations and the reasons for such violations, criminal records, inadequate travel insurance, suspicion of intent to overstay, inconsistent travel history and no ties to home country are all considerations which may raise red flags when considering an application.\n\nReporter:You mention criminal records as a potential red flag, is an arrest without conviction in such applications a criminal record and are ex-convicts able to get visa?\n\nVM: Normally the applications require applicants to only state convictions. However, where the application provides for issues to do with fingerprints having been recorded after arrest, then the production of a certificate of acquittal will be useful.\n\nAs regards ex-convicts, visas may still be granted depending on the nature of the conviction and the policies of the destination country.\n\nHowever, it is helpful for applicants to be comprehensive and transparent in disclosing their legal history.\n\nReporter: You also mentioned ties with the home country, how do you prove these ties?\n\nVM: For certain applications, especially tourist visas, you must be able to show and prove that you will be returning to Zimbabwe after the visit. With this in mind, you can include your current employment, professional or economic ties to Zimbabwe, family and social ties, property and financial ties, community and cultural ties and any other ties that you may consider to be relevant for the visa officer considering your application. I always say that being granted on first application is better than on appeal\n\nReporter: The dreaded word, appeal, what steps should I take when appealing a visa denial?\n\nVM: The first and critical step is to understand the reason for the denial.\n\nEmbassies normally provide a detailed written response outlining the grounds for the refusal. Having understood the grounds for denial, if the grounds are capable of remedy, then the appeal has to address the grounds, providing further evidence and explanations as to why the initial application failed to address the issues raised on denial properly.\n\nThis may include gathering and providing further documentation and proof to satisfy the visa officer from his or her previous misgivings.\n\nThe appeal will also have to be submitted within time and if there are prescribed rules on how the appeal should be submitted, those rules will have to be followed to the letter.\n\nAlternatively, it may be more practical to submit a new application instead of pursuing an appeal. The circumstances dictate the best option.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRelated:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/its-the-only-way-migrants-army-face-off-along-south-africa-zimbabwe-border/",
            "content": "By Al Jazeera\n\nEVERYDAY, Fadzai Musindo walks across the border between Zimbabwe and South Africa  sometimes via the official border post but usually by taking the more dangerous informal route.\n\nStreams of men, women and children regularly cross the bridge separating the two countries, but for the 43-year-old mother of three, it is a necessity so she can earn enough to fend for her children.\n\nMusindo works as a runner, physically carrying goods into Zimbabwe for people who shop in South Africa and need their wares transported to the other side. Amid Zimbabwes ailing economy and scarcity of certain items, the job has become popular.\n\nBut using the formal Beitbridge border post presents more challenges and expenses than solutions for Musindo.\n\nI need to save the pages on my passport so I cant stamp every day. If I did that, I would have to buy a passport every year, I cant do that, she said, determined to put off paying the $150 fee for a replacement travel document for as long as possible.\n\nSo, to make it across to South Africa and back, Musindo walks to the banks of the Limpopo River, one of the largest in Africa, where groups of young men known as guma-gumas smuggle people over for a small fee.\n\nThe crossing is technically illegal, and dangerous  with irregular migrants at risk of being raped or robbed. But Musindo says she walks with other women to avoid the risks.\n\nIf we walk as a group, nothing will happen to us because we are many, she explained about her daily journeys made with a bundled-up cloth on her head, carrying groceries and household items for her clients.\n\nPeople dont bother us because we work here every day. The soldiers know who we are so when they see us passing, they let us go, she claimed.\n\nOnce across, Musindo uses the legal walkways. But through the bush and across the crocodile-infested Limpopo, the 5km (3-mile) stretch is uncertain terrain.\n\nThe guma-gumas promise they can evade the police and soldiers patrolling the bushes along the river, but since South Africas army (SANDF) launched a new border safeguarding operation last year, many are more worried than before.\n\nOn patrol\n\nDeployed under the SANDFs Operation Corona, groups of soldiers with rifles in hand, patrol along the 233km (145-mile) Limpopo border on the lookout for smugglers and people crossing illegally.\n\nOn a patrol in late November, the soldiers camouflaged themselves in the surrounding grassland, waiting to see who would cross.\n\nEventually, two young men passed by, leading a group of three women and a child through the bush; not far behind, a few more young men followed their bush guides into South Africa.\n\nBut as the soldiers appeared from the tall grass, the young men ran away, leaving the group at the armys mercy.\n\nA pregnant woman was caught and taken into custody by the soldiers. The mother of the young boy managed to flee back to the no mans land between Zimbabwe and South Africa, but her son and friend were apprehended and made to sit on the surrounding rocks until a car came to escort them to the border.\n\nFor those who ran away on foot, Major Shihlangoma Mahlahlane, who leads the joint technical operation for Operation Corona, explained that the SANDF cannot pursue them.\n\nIn the middle of the river, its no mans land thats where it divides Zimbabwe and South Africa so when we chase them away they know we cant do anything, Mahlahlane said.\n\nWe need to stop and come back otherwise we will engage with the Zimbabwean authorities. There is nothing we can do about it.\n\nThe enhanced border operation, which began in September and will run until the end of April, covers South Africas borders with Botswana, Mozambique and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe SANDF says since it started, fewer undocumented travellers have been taking the risk of crossing through informal means, even though smuggled goods remain a problem. However, many still take a chance.\n\nTechnical challenges for law enforcement have also created opportunities for smugglers.\n\nIn 2020, a 40km (25-mile) fence was erected between South Africa and Zimbabwe at a cost of $2.1m  but sections have since been cut. Despite efforts to reinstall the boundary, there are gaping holes in the stretch of barbed wire. A holey fence, combined with a seasonally dry river allows people to brave crossing, officials say.\n\nCausing distress\n\ncross Limpopos sandy banks at night, the guma-gumas light fires to keep warm and send signals to other crossers about where to come and wait. They bide their time until the next chance to make the crossing with more people emerges.\n\nBut those taken into custody by the army face a different fate. Immigration officials will send them back to Zimbabwe, but Major Mahlahlane fears that even if they get deported, they may come back again in the hope of seeking better opportunities.\n\nPregnant women cross into South Africa and after they give birth they try to have their child registered as a South African, so they can try to obtain the child grant, he said.\n\nBut, while public hospital facilities in South Africa are far better than those in Zimbabwe, accessing the monthly grant of 530 rand ($29) per child in South Africa is not an automatic process even for single South African mothers.\n\nThe South African Border Management Authority (BMA), set up in April 2023 to improve border control, has deported and arrested more than 410,000 people at different sites since a new coalition government came to power in May last year. The government, made up of 11 parties that campaigned on curbing migration, has promised to speed up deportations as some cases take months to resolve.\n\nHowever, Loren Landau, a professor at the African Centre for Migration and Society at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, which produces academic research on migration trends across the continent, cautions that the fast-track removals of irregular migrants could create other problems.\n\nPart of the BMAs mandate is to ensure people move out of South Africa quickly and when they are deported quickly they dont have access to social workers or lawyers, families get separated and it causes more distress.\n\nOften people come back and instead of using the trusted routes people tend to go underground which could be far more dangerous for vulnerable people and minors, Landau told Al Jazeera.\n\nA bus-to-bus, car-to-car operation\n\nOn the other side of the Limpopo, the Zimbabwean government has launched a crackdown on smugglers and illicit goods brought in by buses, private cars and trucks.\n\nAccording to Tafadzwa Muguti, the secretary for presidential affairs and devolution, a task force which includes the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA), immigration and the police will search all vehicles crossing.\n\nAnyone who cannot account for their goods will have them confiscated and penalties for those who contravene import regulations.\n\nHe said the operation intensified over the recent festive season, a period when smuggling activity often peaks as Zimbabwean expatriates returning home are known to bring goods that evade customs duty, exacerbating the challenges faced by local manufacturers.\n\nThe Beitbridge border, one of Africas busiest, sees more than 13,000 travellers and more than 400 buses crossing daily. Alongside the regular movement, people and goods are smuggled in and out of South Africa daily.\n\nZIMRA estimates Zimbabwe has lost up to $1bn in undeclared import revenue, so the tax agency officials search each border transporter. But the operation has caused lengthy delays at the busy border, frustrating those travelling for the festive season.\n\nAlways another way\n\nFor Musindo, however, the border operation has meant further delays to her work as a runner, as it has cut off the possibility of using faster, alternative means to make the crossing.\n\nWhen its like this, I can wait more than five hours in the queue [at the border post] with someones luggage; on some days it can be even longer, so even though the border can be full with people, in a day I can get 200 rand [$11] if Im lucky to carry for two customers, she lamented.\n\nBeing stuck in long queues can be frustrating for travellers, but for Musindo, waiting for hours while people wade through the queues to get their passports stamped means she earns less money as more time is spent waiting. Though crossing via the Limpopo River is riskier, it takes just 45 minutes, she says.\n\nAware of the dangers, Musindo does not always use the informal route but says when the border is full, she can go back and forth across the river three times a day, instead of only once at the official post.\n\nIts better when there are no delays, I get much more [money]; but for now there is no other way, she explained.\n\nMeanwhile, in the bushes of the Limpopo, more South African forces are on patrol, clamping down on movement.\n\nBecause the river is dry, people are exploiting the gaps. They will not focus on the point of entry, but they would rather come and exploit a gap, said Major Mahlahlane. At times, the river is seasonally dry and more so due to the drought, but the onset of the rains has not deterred people.\n\nHe added that the army is not concerned about Zimbabweans who are in South Africa legally. There will be more security forces along the border  but we are focusing on illegal activity.\n\nSome South African villages along the Limpopo River are also complicit in the illegal ferrying of goods using donkey carts, he said. Cigarettes are common contraband that goes into the South African market. The steep import levies charged by South Africa make smuggling a lucrative option for those looking to evade duties. Since Operation Corona began, more than 8 million rand ($500,000) worth of cigarettes have been seized along border settlements, officials said.\n\nThe issue is not at the border\n\nHowever, permanently clamping down on illicit trade could be difficult for South Africa as the runners and guma-gumas who have crossed the river route for decades could find other paths.\n\nWhenever we invest in more border security there is a race with smugglers, the more we securitise, the more sophisticated people become in getting their goods across, they will always find other means, Landau told Al Jazeera.\n\nReducing irregular migration in the long term requires a multifaceted approach, according to James Chapman, head of advocacy at the Scalabrini Center, a non-profit organisation that protects migrants and refugee rights.\n\nBorder management requires a sustainable, multipronged approach  in a manner that is in keeping with fundamental human rights and South Africas legal framework.\n\nHowever, Landau maintains border control is a political issue, with xenophobia having spurred waves of attacks on foreigners in the past. He argues the main challenge is not migration, but the state of South Africas poor urban areas.\n\nA long-term solution depends on what the problem is and where it is, the issue is not at the border, the problem is in the cities, in townships that have been overtaken by criminal gangs and addressing that issue is key, he said.\n\nCrime and inequality are pervasive issues in post-apartheid South Africa and in marginalised communities, African foreigners are often the target of public frustration.\n\nespite the xenophobic backlash, many Africans still see the continents most industrialised economy as their potential path to a better life.\n\nDespite army patrols heightened along Limpopos sandy marshes and the high risk of being caught as an undocumented person, with the start of another year, new groups of Zimbabweans are considering going to South Africa to escape their countrys economic woes.\n\nMeanwhile, for daily border workers, Musindo feels taking a chance to cross under the bridge is better than waiting in the long queues that cut down the amount of money she is able to earn for her family.\n\nI need to work as much as I can because in January my children need to go back to school. The soldiers might try to stop people, but what can I do? This is the only way I can use, she said, before disappearing back into the moving crowds.\n\n",

The 2030 agenda, now dubbed Resolution #1 will come through constitutional amendments to defer 2028 polls to 2030, thereby automatically extending the MPs tenure.\n\nIf our presence here improves your stay in power and makes the people of Zimbabwe happy, then let it be, Tshabangu said, amid deafening applause from Zanu PF legislators and members of his sellout CCC faction.\n\nParliament of Zimbabwe said the field tour of the 82-year-old Zanu leaders property was the first time that all MPs gathered for a familiarisation tour in a show of political and democratic maturity in the countrys politics.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa and part of the touring parliamentarians and other guests chanting Zanu PF slogans while in a maize field\n\nFormer CCC MP, Fadzayi Mahere took aim at Tshabangu describing his actions as a mockery to democracy.\n\nWriting on social media, Mahere said, This is no longer Parliament. Its a crime scene Mahumbwe chaiwo (a joke). We need new leaders.\n\nThis is the biggest scandal in the history of Zimbabwean politics. It makes a mockery of the effort that sincere opposition politicians made to run in the last elections and its a slap in the face to the electorate that made their will known.\n\nMahere decried the farce that has become Parliament composed of opposition lawmakers captured by Mnangagwa and his cabal.\n\nThey have no idea what their constitutional role is. A sheer waste of taxpayer money. In the end, we will only have one lawmaker, if we arent there already. They are in the guys pocket and its a shame.\n\nThe Sunday event was supposedly a parliamentary tour to familiarise legislators with the Mnangagwa familys farming operations but turned out to be a political gathering to endorse Mnangagwas 2030 agenda, which another faction of his party loyal to Vice President Constantino Chiwenga is strongly opposed to. Chiwenga and his co-deputy president Kembo Mohadi were not present at the controversial event.\n\nTshabangu defended CCC legislators who toured Mnangagwas farm, labelling them as progressive and walking steps toward national unity amid the countrys politically polarized environment.\n\nIn the midst of our toxic and often polarizing political environment, our attendance here demonstrates the indivisibility of Zimbabwe, he said.\n\nSelf-exiled former Cabinet minister Saviour Kasukuwere, who at one time served as the Zanu PF national political commissar, said the Precabe farm meet-up was rubbish.\n\nLet him call for a referendum on this rubbish. We will land in Harare and defeat this satanic arrangement. We have enough forces to defeat this nonsense.\n\nThese are desperate acts of criminals who think they can hoodwink the masses of our people, said Kasukuwere.\n\nThe structures from Zambezi to Limpopo are more than ready to retire these criminals before the end of 2025.\n\nWe have to sack these cheats as a matter of urgency. Zimbabweans unite and send these criminals packing. Enough Is Enough, he added.\n\nOpposition political activist, Job Sikhala said legislators who went to Mnangagwas joint had aligned themselves with the oppressor.\n\nFrom the day you visit Precabe Farm, pretending to be opposition must be the day you must know that we will treat you the way we treat Zanu PF. You are the enemy of the people, and you must be treated as such!!!\n\n",

            "content": "By CNN\n\nVENEZUELAS Nicolas Maduro has been sworn in for a third presidential term in what the countrys opposition movement has decried as coup detat, culminating more than five months of dispute over last summers contested election.\n\nThe ceremony took place on Friday in a small room of the National Assembly, a marked difference from previous ceremonies held in the buildings main hall.\n\nMaduro was sworn in by National Assembly leader, Jorge Rodrguez, who placed the presidential sash on him, prompting thunderous applause from those in attendance.\n\nWeve achieved what we knew we would achieve, Maduro said during his first speech after being sworn in.\n\nThe power given to me was not given by a foreign government, a foreign president or a gringo government, Maduro said at the event, which saw Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega and Cubas Miguel Diaz-Canel in attendance.\n\nNo one in this world can impose a president in Venezuela.\n\nChina and Russia also sent representatives, with Russias State Duma Chairman Vyacheslav Volodin seen arriving late on a state media broadcast after the ceremony began ahead of schedule.\n\nMaduro was proclaimed winner of the countrys presidential election on July 28, by electoral authorities under the tight control of the ruling Socialist Party.\n\nBut Venezuelas opposition has published thousands of voting tallies claiming that their candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, had actually won the vote with 67% against Maduros 30%.\n\nIndependent observers such as the Carter Center and the Colombian Electoral Mission, as well as CNNs own analysis, have found the opposition tallies to be legitimate. And several nations, including the United States, have since recognized Gonzalez as Venezuelas rightful president-elect.\n\nAnd in a speech Friday afternoon, opposition leader Maria Corina Machado remained defiant, accusing Maduros government of trampling on Venezuelas constitution. Going forward, the pressure will increase even more until Maduro understands that this is over, she pledged.\n\nMaduro violates the constitution, also flanked by the dictators of Cuba and Nicaragua, this says it all, she added.\n\nWhite House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby accused Maduro of a complete disregard for democratic norms, describing Fridays swearing-in as an illegitimate inauguration in remarks to reporters.\n\nGonzlez, who has been in exile since September with a bounty on his head by Venezuelan authorities, had pledged to return to Caracas this week in a potential last challenge to Maduros inauguration. But his planned return on Friday was called off due to security concerns, Paraguayan President Santiago Pea told CNNs Isa Soares.\n\nI continue to work on the conditions for my entry into Venezuela and assume, as mandated by the Constitution and ordered by the people, the presidency of the republic and as commander in chief of the national armed forces, Gonzlez said in a statement Friday.\n\nGonzlezs last known location on Friday was the Dominican Republic, where he had recently met with regional leaders.\n\nCriticism and new sanctions\n\nShortly after the inauguration, the US announced an 18-month extension of Temporary Protected Status for eligible Venezuelan nationals, and new rewards for information leading to the arrest of Maduro and his closest officials, including Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello.\n\nThe rewards for Maduro and for Cabello  now amounting to $25 million each  are the maximum rewards allowed under the State Departments narcotics reward program, an official said.\n\nThe US also announced new visa restrictions for Maduro-aligned officials whom the administration says are responsible for undermining Venezuelas electoral process, and individual sanctions on eight Maduro-aligned officials overseeing economic and security agencies in Venezuela, including a state-owned oil company and Maduros transportation minister.\n\nOn a call previewing the announcement, the official told reporters that Maduro stands mostly alone at this juncture, with few friends in the region and the world, noting statements from countries throughout the region and across the globe since July 28th to call on Maduro to respect democratic norms.\n\nMeanwhile, the United Kingdom on Friday sanctioned 15 people associated with Maduro and what it called his contested regime, including leaders from Venezuelas Armed Forces and members of the Supreme Justice Tribunal.\n\nThe European Union also issued sanctions against 15 people affiliated with Maduro, who have been accused of undermining democracy, rule of law or human rights in Venezuela. And Canada sanctioned 14 current and former senior officials who it said engaged in activities that supported human rights violations in the country.\n\nThe G7 also criticized the inauguration, saying it lacked democratic legitimacy. We reject Maduros continued and repressive grasp at power at the expense of the Venezuelan people, a statement from the group read.\n\nA new phase begins today\n\nMaduro did not name any of Venezuelas opposition leaders in his speech, but referred to the movement currently led by Machado and Gonzalez as Guaid 2.0  a reference to Juan Guaid, who in 2019 proclaimed himself interim president of Venezuela and was recognized by 50 countries, including the US.\n\nA Guaid 2.0 talks to the people in the streets, a new Guaid, and comes with the same baggage, we saw it, we saw their plans, we saw them yesterday, Maduro said, apparently referring to an opposition rally attended by Machado on Thursday.\n\nGuaid also condemned the inauguration, writing on X that the president of Venezuela is Edmundo Gonzlez Urrutia.\n\nMaduro only confirms his usurpation and the coup dtat they carried out on July 28, Guaid added. Venezuelan opposition coalition Plataforma de la Unidad Democrtica echoed Guaids remarks, saying, a new phase begins today in this fight for the freedom of Venezuela throughout the national territory and in all sectors that form our nation.\n\nAnd Human Rights Watch Americas director Juanita Goebertus criticized Maduros swearing-in as the culmination of an election that blatantly disregarded the peoples will and consolidates a dictatorship only sustained by brutal repression.\n\nOpposition leader Maria Corina Machado greets supporters during a protest against Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro the day before his inauguration for a third term in Caracas, Venezuela, on January 9.\n\nAhead of the inauguration, Venezuela closed its land border and suspended flights to Colombia  a move that Freddie Bernal, the governor of the Venezuelan border state of Tachira, claimed was in reaction to a international conspiracy against Venezuela, in an Instagram post. He did not provide proof for his claim.\n\nThe border closure came just hours after Colombia broke its silence on the issue and announced it would not recognize the results of last summers elections, stating they were not free.\n\nProtests erupted in Caracas and other Venezuelan cities ahead of the inauguration, with Machado emerging from hiding to speak at one event on Thursday.\n\nMachado was later violently intercepted at the event, according to her team, which said that during the period of her kidnapping she was forced to record several videos and was later released. The Venezuelan government has denied detaining Machado.\n\nMachado said that despite attempts to quell dissent, Venezuelans had defeated fear with Thursdays rallies.\n\nYesterday, hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans went to the streets with civility, courage and profound love, Machado said in her video message Friday.\n\n",

I think the formal sectors costs are very high at the moment.\n\nThe cost of power, labour and various statutory costs. It is critical that we grow the base. And once we grow the formal base, the tax revenues will grow automatically.\n\nSo, I think it is important at this moment in time to level the playing field, reduce taxes, reduce compliance costs, make compliance easy, so we can grow the formal market for the future of the economy, Ahmed said.\n\nThe company is producing 300 tonnes of wheat products per day and prefers to supply direct to huge retailers, avoiding the middleman in order to avoid counterfeit products on the market.\n\nWe have always been very strong with our big retailers, your Pick and Pay, your OK, your N. Richards and Gain. That has always been our traditional route to markets.\n\nWe enjoy that market because it gives us a good shelf presence, we ensure that the products that we produce actually get to the retailer. It avoids counterfeit products. So, were very pro the formal market,\n\nThe managing director highlighted that the market had shifted forcing most companies to cover every segment of the consumer.\n\nWe are forced to be both in the informal and formal market. Generally, the liquidity in the country is tight.\n\nThe formal retailers are struggling at the moment. I think the informal sector has become very strong. And given the overhead structure thats in the formal sector, they are struggling. And this is translating into cash flow which has an impact in our ability to supply the retailers., added Ahmed.\n\nHowever, he said the milling company, one of the largest in Africa, will not tire but adjust to current business environment.\n\nWe are navigating, we are looking for solutions with them, looking for payment solutions that are flexible.\n\nWe take local currency, we take ZIG, we take US dollars, we take Rand. Were trying to make it as easy as possible for the retailers. From our point of view, it is important that the retail sector survives in the country for the future of the economy, for the benefit of the fiscus, and for the general economic growth, he added.\n\nAhmed projected a high demand for Mega Market products.\n\n If you produce a good quality product and you have availability of product, I think there is demand out there.\n\nSo, were continuing to grow. Were continuing to go at full speed. Were looking at various projects of value addition and beneficiation.\n\nWe are looking at setting up a noodles line. Were looking at cereal lines, pasta lines, and various other projects that are currently in the feasibility stage. Weve all focus on the economy, and we continue to grow as a business.\n\nHigh production costs have led to closure of many companies in Zimbabwe.\n\n",

It is take-it-or-leave it, said Shoriwa.\n\nAfter a long tiring day at work, you wouldnt want to be standing at the congested ranks risking being robbed and unsure when you will get home to your children.\n\nYou end up paying whatever amount, US$1 or US$2 for a trip that normally costs half that fare, she added.\n\nA commuter omnibus conductor, Munyaradzi Chogugudza said kombi crews take advantage of the rain season to increase daily takings.\n\nIt is time for us to cash in on the rains.

Some roads, although trafficable, are being used as an excuse to inflate fares.\n\nPAZ is demanding fair bus fares pricing and transparency.\n\nTransport operators must charge fares that reflect the actual distance travelled and the conditions of roads.\n\nOperators should clearly display their fare structures and provide explanations for any price increases.\n\nGoliath said relevant authorities must intervene and regulate fares and ensure that passengers are not exploited.\n\nTogether, we can fight for fair and affordable transportation, said the PAZ president.\n\n",
