The directive given to the local authority is a direct attack on Section 276 of the Constitution, which enshrines devolution.\n\nIn fact, this entire land issue is an assault on devolution as provided for in Chapter 14 of the Constitution, particularly Sections 274 and 276. Local authorities must retain autonomy in decision-making, Akili told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nGovernment has been at loggerheads with Pinnacle Holdings over the land in Harare South which the latter claims ownership of.\n\nThe directive awaits approval from the local authority through a council resolution, which would facilitate the land transfer to Pinnacle Holdings.\n\nAkili further argued that the HCC should not be entangled in the dispute between the government and Pinnacle Holdings, as the council was not party to the original agreement.\n\nIt would be prudent for the local authority, particularly the councillors, to be guided by Chapter 14 of the Constitution on devolution.\n\nThe councillors must recognise that they cannot transfer any land to Pinnacle Holdings, which has no existing agreement with the City of Harare. In fact, Pinnacle Holdings has no locus standi in this matter, Akili said.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nThe Supreme Court of Appeal has dismissed with costs the Department of Home Affairs attempt to overturn an interim interdict, previously granted in favour of the Zimbabwe Immigration Federation, protectingnearly 200,000 Zimbabwean Exemption Permit (ZEP) holdersagainst arrest and deportation.\n\nAfter winning Part A of the court wrangle, the federation will be heading back to the court, for Part B, to argue before court that the Department of Home Affairs overreached in 2021, when the then home affairs minister Aaron Motsoaledi announced the termination of the ZEP.\n\nThe special permit dispensation has allowed 180,000 Zimbabwean nationals to live and work in South Africa since 2009.\n\nIn the federations view, the jurisdiction to terminate the ZEP lies with Parliament, not the minister.\n\nIOL had an interview with Vindren Magadzire, director of the Zimbabwe Immigration Federation who said his organisations case revolves around the termination of the ZEP programme by the minister of home affairs.\n\nVindren Magadzire, director of the Zimbabwe Immigration Federation Image:Supplied\n\nThe programme allowed approximately 180,000 Zimbabweans to live and work in South Africa. In 2021, the minister of home affairs announced plans to terminate the ZEP permits, sparking legal actions from the Zimbabwe Immigration Federation, Magadzire told IOL.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Immigration Federation was inspired to go through courts due to the South African minister of home affairs decision to terminate the permits. The decision would have significant implications for approximately 180,000 Zimbabweans living and working in South Africa under the ZEP permit program.\n\nMagadzire said his organisation is requesting the superior court to declare the termination of the ZEP permits unlawful, setting aside the termination decision, and protecting permit holders rights.\n\nIn Magadzires view, a lasting solution would be granting the ZEP holders permanent residence status in South Africa.\n\nThe latest development in the court case is that the Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed the minister of home affairs appeal. This decision upholds a Johannesburg High Court interdict that shields approximately 180,000 ZEP holders from arrest and deportation, said Magadzire.\n\nLast year,IOL reported thatthe High Court in Pretoria heard arguments from the Helen Suzman Foundation to enforce the courts order that the ZEP remains valid, while the minister of home affairs conducts a fair and rational inquiry into the impact of its termination.\n\nThe foundation turned to court in a bid to give ZEP holders a lifeline.\n\nWhen the minister first signalled his intention to appeal the courts June 2023 judgment, the foundation asked him to leave the ZEP in place until he exhausted the appeal process. The minister refused, Nicole Fritz, executive director of the foundation said at the time.\n\nThe court had held earlier that the ministers appeal had no prospects of success. Home Affairs then decided to turn to the Supreme Court of Appeal.\n\n",

It is reported that there were 4,912 injuries and 76 fatalities throughout the year. What about those accidents that went unreported? It is our demand that we cannot continue to suffer from workplace neglect as workers without the responsible authorities being brought to account for the injuries and deaths being experienced in the workplace, she said.\n\nTaruvinga said the mining industry has become synonymous with unsafe shafts, equipment failure, and weak regulations that are causing unnecessary deaths.\n\nIn Agriculture, she said, employees work without personal protective equipment and are exposed to chemicals, heat stress, and poor living conditions, while in the retail and commercial sectors, workers are exposed to long hours of work, job insecurity and poor ergonomics.\n\nTaruvinga said that in the informal sector, over 80% of workers operate with no safety laws, medical care, or recognisable rights, while the transport and manufacturing sectors have also not been spared, as workers work with very dangerous old and archaic machinery, poorly maintained and without proper safety nets.\n\nAs the voice of workers, we clearly pronounce that enough is enough. We demand the following: Full enforcement of OSH laws across all economic sectors, establishment of functional health and safety committees in every workplace and access to adequate PPE, occupational health training, and medicalservices for all workers, added Taruvinga.\n\nThe June 6 commemorations are held annually to reflect on the Kamandama Mine Disaster, in which 427 miners were killed in 1972 in a mine explosion. The accident, which was attributed to a methane gas explosion, forced the permanent closure of the mine.\n\n",

He signed a similar order in 2017 during his first term in office.\n\nThe White House said these common sense restrictions would protect Americans from dangerous foreign actors.\n\nThere are a number of people from affected countries who may still be able to enter the US due to a number of exceptions. The order does not apply to:\n\nIn a video posted to his Truth Social website last week, Trump said the recent attack in Boulder, Colorado underscored the extreme dangers posed by foreign nationals who had not been properly vetted.\n\nTwelve people were injured in Colorado on 1 June when a man attacked a group gathering in support of Israeli hostages. The FBI called it a suspected terror attack and said the suspect had used a makeshift flamethrower, Molotov cocktails and other incendiary devices.\n\nThe man accused of carrying out the attack was identified as an Egyptian national, but Egypt has not been included on the list of banned countries.\n\nTrumps latest order, which is likely to face legal challenges, drew a swift response, at home and abroad.\n\nChad retaliated by suspending all visas to US citizens while Somalia promised to work with the US to address security issues.\n\nThe African Union, which represents all countries on the continent, called on the US to engage in constructive dialogue with the countries concerned.\n\nIn the US, Democrats were quick to condemn the move.\n\nThis ban, expanded from Trumps Muslim ban in his first term, will only further isolate us on the world stage, Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal wrote on social media.\n\nBut others support the ban.\n\nCongressman Clay Higgins of Louisiana told the BBC that travel to the US was a privilege, not a right.\n\n",

Following US mediation, Rwanda and DR Congo are working on a draft peace plan that is expected to be signed later this month.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Congolese presidency, the Eccas leaders at the summit acknowledged the aggression against the Democratic Republic of Congo by Rwanda and ordered the aggressor country to withdraw its troops from Congolese soil.\n\nIt added that until the dispute was resolved, it was decided that Equatorial Guinea would remain in the chairman role to the detriment of Rwanda.\n\nIn comments directed at Rwanda, Congolese government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said that one cannot continually and voluntarily violate the principles that underpin our regional institutions and claim to want to preside over them.\n\nHe added that the Eccas decision should inspire other regional organisations to adopt a firmer stance against Rwanda.\n\nRwanda has been accused of supporting M23 rebels in the east of DR Congo. The group has made major advances at the beginning of the year, taking the key regional cities of Goma and Bukavu.\n\nDR Congos government, the US and France have identified Rwanda as backing the M23.\n\nLast year, a UN experts report said that up to 4,000 Rwandan troops were fighting alongside the rebels.\n\nBut Rwanda has denied the accusations, saying instead that its troops were deployed along its border to prevent the conflict spilling over into its territory.\n\nRwanda has once before, in 2007, left Eccas, whose mission is to foster co-operation and strengthen regional integration in central Africa. It rejoined several years later.\n\n",
