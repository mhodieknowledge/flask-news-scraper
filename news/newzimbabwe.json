            "content": "By Business Insider\n\nCHINAS push to globalize its currency, the yuan, is gaining traction in Africa, with the continent emerging as a strategic testing ground for Beijings broader de-dollarization ambitions.\n\nIn a recent milestone, the central banks of China and Egypt signed a series of agreements to increase yuan use in bilateral trade and investment.\n\nThe deals, signed during Chinese Premier Li Qiangs visit to Cairo last week, were praised by Peoples Bank of China governor Pan Gongsheng as a key step in advancing economic ties between the two countries.\n\nKey provisions include electronic payment cooperation such as expanding Chinas UnionPay system in Egypt, and enabling cross-border yuan-denominated transactions for banks operating in the China-Egypt TEDA Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone.\n\nThese financial operations will be processed through the Cross-border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), Chinas alternative to the SWIFT network, thereby reducing reliance on Western financial systems.\n\nWith this development, Egypt now joins a growing list of African nations, including South Africa, Nigeria, and Angola, that are actively incorporating the yuan into their trade and financial dealings with China.\n\nChinas growing currency ambition in Africa\n\nThe expansion of the yuan across Africa is part of Chinas broader strategy to challenge the dominance of the U.S. dollar.\n\nThis move aligns with the continents gradual shift away from Western financial systems toward a China-Russia-led coalition under BRICS, reflecting a strategic effort to diversify trade and currency frameworks.\n\nChina-Africa trade reached $282 billion in 2023, cementing Chinas 15-year run as the continents top trading partner. The surge has boosted renminbi use in cross-border deals and reserve holdings.\n\nBeyond Egypt, where the central banks recently signed agreements to deepen yuan usage in trade and investment, China has steadily advanced its currency diplomacy across Africa.\n\nAs early as 2015, South Africa signed a 30 billion yuan swap deal to improve trade liquidity. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) explained that the three-year agreement was designed to facilitate trade and investment and serve as a buffer for short-term balance of payment pressures.\n\nEarlier this year, Nigeria and China renewed their bilateral currency swap deal valued at 15 billion yuan (3.19 trillion), three years after the initial agreement expired.\n\nThe Peoples Bank of China said the renewed three-year pact aims to promote bilateral trade and investment facilitation.\n\nIn Angola, a key oil supplier to China, the yuan is increasingly being used in energy and infrastructure transactions, with the Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS), Chinas alternative to SWIFT, being integrated into the financial system.\n\nLauren Johnston, a senior research fellow at the AustChina Institute and China-Africa expert, told the South China Morning Post that Africa offers a strategic testbed for Beijings currency goals.\n\nAfrica is a continent where trade with China is important, but it is also one where many countries struggle to access sufficient foreign currencies such as the euro or US dollar, she noted.\n\nJohnston added, For China, there may be a chance to test the internationalisation of the RMB via a few countries in Africa first, where volumes might be small on a global scale and Chinas footprint in the region relatively large.\n\nThese efforts mark a broader rebalancing of global financial influence, with China positioning the yuan as a viable alternative in Africas evolving economic landscape.\n\n",

Sales volumes fell 19% in the first quarter, grew 24% in the second, rose 8% in the third, before slipping 3% in the final quarter.\n\nThe reason?\n\nAuthorities controlled the in-store exchange rate throughout the year, whereas informal players used higher exchange rates aligned with the parallel market.\n\nThis allowed informal traders to offer lower prices in USD, bleeding supermarkets across the market, including OK Zim and Spar.\n\nThat changed earlier this year when the government repealed SI 81A through SI 34 of 2025. USD sales, which made up just 23% of total sales last year, have now crawled up to 32%.\n\nUnit sales volumes rose by 8%, reflecting sustained consumer demand, Pick n Pay says.\n\nLast year, Pick n Pay shut down three stores in Chegutu, Harare Street and Southwold. It opened one in Hogerty Hill.\n\nThe company is back in expansion mode. A new branch opened in Shurugwi, and more are on the way. The focus is on high-potential stores in mining towns, liquor category development, and fixing supply chains for remote areas.\n\nTheres also a big move coming in Bulawayo. Pick n Pays property arm plans to develop what it calls the citys largest mall of its kind, with over 220 small shops, food outlets and office space.
