            "content": "IOL\n\nThe Southern African Development Community (SADC) Election Observer Mission (SEOM) has declared that Tanzanias 2025 general election failed to meet its standards for a credible, free and fair vote.\n\nDelivering the preliminary statement in Dodoma on Monday, former Malawi Speaker of Parliament Richard Msowoya, who led the mission, said the polls fell short of the requirements of the SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections.\n\nThe election was conducted over two days: security forces voted on October 28 2025, in Zanzibar, and the rest of the electorate voted on October 29, 2025.\n\nMsowoya said observers encountered challenges in consulting with key stakeholders, particularly the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC), as they had not been issued with Introduction Letters together with Accreditation Identification Cards as required by the law.\n\nHe noted that some INEC officials required the said Introduction Letters before consultations with the SEOM observers, but other officials did not make such a requirement.\n\nHe added that some stakeholders were reluctant to share information with the observers and often referred them to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and East African Cooperation.\n\nIn Tanga Town, observers were subjected to aggressive interrogation by the security forces, had their official documents, including their passports, seized, though later returned, and were forced to delete mission-related photographs from their official gadgets.\n\nThe mission observed that the country was largely calm during the pre-election period and most of election day, save for isolated incidents towards the closure of the voting.\n\nHowever, some stakeholders cautioned that the general calm and peace belies covert acts of general intimidation of the population and opposition political parties and candidates.\n\nThese stakeholders cited the alleged abductions of some political activists, Msowoya said.\n\nThe stakeholders highlighted the arrest of members of the opposition, notably the detention and trial of Tundu Lissu, the leader of the main opposition party, Chama cha Demokrasia na Maendeleo (CHADEMA), on treason charges.\n\nHe said, The disqualification of some opposition candidates, particularly of Mr. Luhaga Mpina of ACT-Wazalendo also raised questions about the fairness of the electoral landscape.\n\nSome viewed the arrests and disqualifications as undermining the URTs multi-party system by removing legitimate competition in the electoral process, creating an uneven political playing field and discouraging voter turnout.\n\nThe elections were overseen by the INEC and the Zanzibar Electoral Commission (ZEC).\n\nMsowoya said most stakeholders agreed that the bodies were adequately prepared to conduct the 2025 elections, and voter registration was conducted in phases.\n\nOut of a total population of 61.7 million, the commission registered 37.6 million voters  a 26.5% increase from 2020  with women making up 50.31% of registrants.\n\nHowever, some stakeholders expressed concern that there had not been any comprehensive electoral law reforms since the last elections, while others acknowledged some progress.\n\nThe mission pointed to constitutional provisions that limit electoral justice, such as Article 41(7), which effectively bars any court from entertaining any challenge against the results of a presidential election.\n\nMsowoya said this is contrary to the expectation of electoral justice as envisaged by Article 4.1.5 of the SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections.\n\nHe also noted that Articles 39, 67 and 77 restrict independent candidates, limiting the individuals freedom of association.\n\nSome stakeholders questioned the Commissions independence given that its members are appointed by the President, who is also chairperson of the ruling party and a presidential candidate.\n\nConcerns were also raised over early voting for security personnel in Zanzibar, with some viewing it as a potential risk for electoral fraud.\n\nThe mission noted that only three of the 17 presidential candidates were women.\n\nStakeholders cited persistent barriers to meaningful participation of women and youth, including limited campaign financing and logistics, leadership training and mentorship opportunities, internal nomination processes within parties, and enduring patriarchal norms.\n\nCultural attitudes also hinder the participation of the youth, Msowoya said.\n\nHe added that in some rural areas, when youth show interest in participating in elections, the elderly express their preference for married people as opposed to single youth.\n\nThe SEOM found that 49,174 registered voters were persons with disabilities.\n\nYouth and women-led organisations played an active role in voter education through radio, television, music and community-based initiatives, though concerns were raised about reduced funding for voter and civic education and delays in accreditation.\n\nThe mission also noted increasing covert and overt limitations on the right to freedom of expression and heavy censorship of online information platforms. Some social media platforms were inaccessible during the vote.\n\nOn election day, SEOM observed polling in 27 regions.\n\nThe Mission was able to observe the opening of polls in some polling stations but could not generate all data relating to opening and voting processes as a result of an internet outage around midday, Msowoya said.\n\nDue to protests and connectivity issues, the mission could not observe the closing and counting processes in most of the areas.\n\nDespite the challenges, the SEOM noted that 70% of the polling stations and their surroundings were free of campaign materials, and 93% of the polling stations observed opened on time.\n\nThe voters register was displayed in most polling stations, and the presence of police was observed at 96%, with most officers unarmed.\n\nHowever, the Mission noted a very low voter turnout in all polling stations observed, and some polling centres did not have voters at all.\n\nIn some polling stations observed, there were multiple orderly stacked ballots in the ballot box during voting, which created a perception of ballot stuffing, Msowoya added.\n\nDomestic observers were largely absent, he said.\n\nIn view of the Mission observations as detailed above, and mindful of the preliminary nature of this statement, it is the SEOMs tentative conclusion that, in most areas, voters could not express their democratic will.\n\nOverall, the 2025 General Election in the United Republic of Tanzania fell short of the requirements of the SADC Principles and Guidelines Governing Democratic Elections.\n\nThe mission urged Tanzanians to channel their concerns through established legal procedures and processes and not resort to violence or threats thereof.\n\n",

thereby causing a fatal crash.\n\nThe accident, which occurred Saturday at the intersection of Josiah Tongogara Avenue and Leopold Takawira Street, left one person dead while 17 others were

            "content": "By Xinhua\n\nTHE upcoming China International Import Expo (CIIE) offers a gateway for Zimbabwean horticultural products to enter the Chinese market, enabling local businesses to directly connect with Chinese buyers and partners, a Zimbabwean exporter has said.\n\nIn a recent interview with Xinhua, Tatenda Mukazi, marketing director of Procitru Investments, a Zimbabwean private company that contracts the growing of fresh produce and other horticultural crops mainly for export, said the CIIE is expected to open new avenues and unlock more growth opportunities for Zimbabwean exports to China.The expo will be held in Shanghai from November 5 to 10. According to Chinas Ministry of Commerce, this years event will feature an expanded special zone for African products, with the number of participating African enterprises increasing by 80 percent year on year.We are going to exhibit blueberries, avocados, avocado oil and macadamia nuts, said Mukazi, who will attend the CIIE for the first time.Zimbabwes blueberries are set to enter the Chinese market following the signing of an export deal during Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwas visit to China in September. A trade protocol on Zimbabwean avocado exports was also signed last September, a move that has excited local farmers eager to access the Chinese market.For this trip, we are going to look for markets, meet buyers and explore machines that can process blueberries into juice for export. We are also looking for partners to do business with, Mukazi said.The expo will also allow him to better understand Chinese market dynamics and systems.I am going to visit their supermarkets and facilities to see how they operate, how they run their systems, and their payment methods, so that we move on the same page, he added.One of Mukazis key goals is to secure direct export agreements with Chinese businesses.I am aiming to meet real buyers so that we can cut off all the middlemen. This is why I am pushing for this trip to be successful, he said.With years of experience in exporting fresh produce, Mukazi works closely with Zimbabwean farmers to identify markets and facilitate exports. He said that the Chinese market represents a significant opportunity for local exporters and that the CIIE serves as a vital bridge connecting Zimbabwean farmers with one of the worlds largest consumer markets.The expo, he added, allows Zimbabwean exporters to showcase a broader range of products beyond the countrys traditional exports such as minerals.Now we are venturing into horticulture, citrus, avocados and berries. For us, it is a great opportunity. We need to show the Chinese market that we are not only buyers; we also have value to offer back home. We can be customers to them, and they can be customers to us, said Mukazi.For us, it is a challenge. We need to up our game and be ready for big deals. It is a new adventure, a new market, and great exposure for us, he added.Beyond opening new export markets, Mukazi sees the CIIE as a platform to deepen partnerships with Chinese companies. As trade with China expands, he said, there is a growing need to work with Chinese partners to increase value addition for local produce such as avocados and blueberries.Already, we have local companies processing avocado oil. On this trip, we are going to bring some samples to market and see how the Chinese market responds, Mukazi said.\n\nIn a recent interview with Xinhua, Tatenda Mukazi, marketing director of Procitru Investments, a Zimbabwean private company that contracts the growing of fresh produce and other horticultural crops mainly for export, said the CIIE is expected to open new avenues and unlock more growth opportunities for Zimbabwean exports to China.\n\nThe expo will be held in Shanghai from November 5 to 10.

That is loyalty, l stand with the President, his two vice presidents, his ministers and advisors.\n\nI am saying this because there are rumours circulating to the effect that l want to takeover from my father (Mnangagwa). I am not a mentally deranged to plot to takeover from my fathers role when he is still in that position, said Tungwarara.\n\nZanu PF national commissar Munyaradzi Machacha and Provincial Affairs Minister Misheck Mugadza were among high-ranking party officials, who attended the event.\n\nAffiliates which received varying amounts of money included Boyz DzaMudhara, Crossborders4ED, Pastors 4ED, Hairdressers 4ED, among others.\n\nHimself a controversial character whose family members flaunt wealth on social media while abroad on shopping jaunts, Tungwarara is a beneficiary of Mnangagwas governments largesse, with his Prevail International Group getting lucrative tenders.\n\n",
