            "content": "The Star\n\nA memorial service for Zambias former President Edgar Chagwa Lungu is being held Tuesday at the Cathedral in Pretoria, South Africa, under a cloud of political tension and unresolved conflict between his family and the Zambian government.\n\nMourners, including members of the Patriotic Front (PF), Lungus former ruling party, filled the cathedral as emotional tributes were paid to the late statesman.\n\nHowever, the atmosphere was not one of peace.\n\nInstead, it reflected the deepening rift over Lungus legacy, his cause of death, and the governments controversial handling of his passing.\n\nThe 68-year-old former president died last Thursday in a South African hospital, where he had been undergoing treatment for an undisclosed illness.\n\nSince his death, speculation and accusations have surfaced, with some PF leaders claiming Lungu may have been poisoned  a charge the Zambian government has not addressed publicly.\n\nAccording to hospital sources, government officials allegedly tried to repatriate Lungus body to Zambia without the familys consent.\n\nMedical staff say they were intimidated and threatened, prompting outrage from PF leaders and human rights groups alike.\n\nSpeaking at a media roundtable in Sandton, Johannesburg, PF Secretary General Mangani Nakacinda condemned the governments actions, calling them a calculated political manoeuvre to seize control of the narrative. Nakacinda added,\n\nThis is no longer just about mourning a former president  it is about defending his dignity and our democracy.\n\nOne of the most contentious issues is the Zambian governments reported insistence on taking full control of Lungus funeral arrangements.\n\nThe Lungu family, backed by PF allies, has resisted this, citing concerns about trust and transparency. So far, the standoff has stalled any official state funeral plans.\n\nAdding to the pain and confusion, two of Lungus children were allegedly denied permission to leave Zambia to attend their fathers memorial in South Africa. Family representatives say the travel ban is another example of the administrations deliberate cruelty.\n\nInside Zambia, the situation is increasingly volatile. PF members have vowed to fight until the end to expose what they claim is a campaign to erase Lungus political legacy and prevent scrutiny into the events leading to his death.\n\nMeanwhile, the government appears determined to maintain authority over the funeral process, citing protocol and national interest.\n\nThe late presidents political comeback in 2023 had reignited tensions in the country. After years of relative silence, Lungu announced his intention to run in the 2026 elections, challenging the ruling United Party for National Development (UPND) and its leader, President Hakainde Hichilema.\n\nIn response, the Constitutional Court ruled him ineligible, sparking legal and political protests.Shortly after, Lungu was stripped of all state benefits, including security and medical support, further isolating him.\n\nPF leaders claim these actions left him vulnerable, even hindering access to vital medical treatment in the months before his death.\n\nAs his body remains in South Africa and legal negotiations continue behind the scenes, todays memorial has become more than a moment of remembrance  it is a flashpoint in a deepening national crisis.\n\nThe treatment of former President Lungu is a reflection of the state of our democracy, said Brian Mundubile, a senior PF figure.\n\nThis is about justice, truth, and respect  not just for him, but for all Zambians.With the cause of Lungus death still unconfirmed and calls for an independent investigation growing louder, todays service may not be the end of mourning but the beginning of a prolonged battle for answers.\n\n",

The directive given to the local authority is a direct attack on Section 276 of the Constitution, which enshrines devolution.\n\nIn fact, this entire land issue is an assault on devolution as provided for in Chapter 14 of the Constitution, particularly Sections 274 and 276. Local authorities must retain autonomy in decision-making, Akili told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nGovernment has been at loggerheads with Pinnacle Holdings over the land in Harare South which the latter claims ownership of.\n\nThe directive awaits approval from the local authority through a council resolution, which would facilitate the land transfer to Pinnacle Holdings.\n\nAkili further argued that the HCC should not be entangled in the dispute between the government and Pinnacle Holdings, as the council was not party to the original agreement.\n\nIt would be prudent for the local authority, particularly the councillors, to be guided by Chapter 14 of the Constitution on devolution.\n\nThe councillors must recognise that they cannot transfer any land to Pinnacle Holdings, which has no existing agreement with the City of Harare. In fact, Pinnacle Holdings has no locus standi in this matter, Akili said.\n\n",

In 2021, the minister of home affairs announced plans to terminate the ZEP permits, sparking legal actions from the Zimbabwe Immigration Federation, Magadzire told IOL.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Immigration Federation was inspired to go through courts due to the South African minister of home affairs decision to terminate the permits. The decision would have significant implications for approximately 180,000 Zimbabweans living and working in South Africa under the ZEP permit program.\n\nMagadzire said his organisation is requesting the superior court to declare the termination of the ZEP permits unlawful, setting aside the termination decision, and protecting permit holders rights.\n\nIn Magadzires view, a lasting solution would be granting the ZEP holders permanent residence status in South Africa.\n\nThe latest development in the court case is that the Supreme Court of Appeal dismissed the minister of home affairs appeal. This decision upholds a Johannesburg High Court interdict that shields approximately 180,000 ZEP holders from arrest and deportation, said Magadzire.\n\nLast year,IOL reported thatthe High Court in Pretoria heard arguments from the Helen Suzman Foundation to enforce the courts order that the ZEP remains valid, while the minister of home affairs conducts a fair and rational inquiry into the impact of its termination.\n\nThe foundation turned to court in a bid to give ZEP holders a lifeline.\n\nWhen the minister first signalled his intention to appeal the courts June 2023 judgment, the foundation asked him to leave the ZEP in place until he exhausted the appeal process. The minister refused, Nicole Fritz, executive director of the foundation said at the time.\n\nThe court had held earlier that the ministers appeal had no prospects of success. Home Affairs then decided to turn to the Supreme Court of Appeal.\n\n",

            "content": "ByLindaMujuruandGamuchiraiMasiyiwa,GPJZimbabwe\n\nThis story was originally published byGlobalPressJournal.\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  The vendors rarely see it coming. The municipal police, some in plainclothes and others in uniform, move through the crowd silent and unnoticed. When they finally strike, panic erupts. Vendors scatter, trampling their goods and grabbing what they can. A few are arrested. Their wares are seized and tossed into the back of a police truck.\n\nThey have no mercy at all. Once they take your stock, youll never get it back, says Saul Nhema, an informal vendor who has been selling vegetables for three months after losing his job as a construction worker.\n\nOn the day of this interview, the municipal police had already raided these informal vendors selling along Park Street in Harares central business district twice. As Global Press Journal reporters interviewed Nhema, they struck again. He grabbed his stock and fled in the middle of the interview.\n\nThe Harare City Council has for years waged such crackdowns on vendors, often destroying goods and deploying heavy police forces. Local government insists these crackdowns are necessary to enforce city bylaws, citing vending from illegal spots, littering and health concerns.\n\nYet the scale and intensity of recent operations, backed by expanding police presence and significant public spending, have raised questions. Critics argue that the government is wasting scarce resources targeting informal vendors all while it struggles to provide city residents with basic services, such as cleanwater.\n\nIn 2024, the councils revenue stood at just US$3 million. But policing costs for these crackdowns exceeded US$24 million, eight times the councils income.\n\nIn 2025, the council escalated its crackdown by creating a specialized police unit to target vendors, further deepening the financial strain with a slight budget increase  and pushing the total to around 12 times its income, which is projected to fall to just US$2 million.\n\nAs the councils income dwindles, the central government shoulders much of the financial burden.\n\nZvikomborero Guvheya serves customers while Saul Nhema arranges vegetables at their vending posts along a Harare sidewalk. Informal vendors like Guvheya and Nhema play a vital role in Zimbabwes struggling economy but face frequent raids, bribe demands and constant threats from municipal police crackdowns.

Photo Credit: Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nGlobal Press Journal made numerous requests for an interview with the mayor. He did not respond.\n\nThe additional cost of the special police unit is hard to justify, given the potential benefits of supporting informal vendors, says Reuben Akili, director of the Combined Harare Residents Association.\n\nIf we examine the funds allocated for enforcement covering salaries, fuel and operational costs, those resources could have been redirected toward rehabilitating markets or public restrooms in the city, Akili says.\n\nThe informal sector already sustains over 80% of Zimbabwes population and contributes nearly 72% to the countrys gross domestic product. Street vendors dominate the sector in many African countries, accounting for over 85% of jobs, many held by women.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the vendors are becoming increasingly critical, as the countrys currency crisis forces many retail shops to shut down.\n\nDespite this central role in many economies across the continent, vendors face common struggles. Many work in hostile, unregulated spaces, and they are routinely evicted under the pretext of urban order or dismissed as a threat to the health of formal economies.\n\nA special municipal police unit to push out this critical population in Harare will only inflate the citys workforce, which ultimately burdens taxpayers, Akili says. Instead, he says the council should build infrastructure where vendors can comfortably work.\n\nAn aerial view shows a municipal police truck carrying goods confiscated from vendors. Vendors who are arrested during crackdowns often lose their stock permanently, with little recourse to reclaim their goods.Photo credit: Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThere are some designated spaces within the central business district, but many vendors shun these, citing the high cost of renting stalls and a lack of foot traffic, which limits their ability to attract customers. Additionally, these spaces require a formal business license, which costs between US$400 and US$800 per year. In an economy that has struggled for decades, this cost is prohibitive for many.\n\nThe council must strike a balance between tackling these issues without undermining the livelihoods of those who depend on the informal economy, says Samuel Wadzai, director of Vendors Initiative for Social and Economic Transformation, a nonprofit that represents vendors.\n\nRaids havent been effective, he says, not even when a former minister of local government requested deployment of the army to push out vendors.\n\nDespite this central role in many economies across the continent, vendors face common struggles. Many work in hostile, unregulated spaces, and they are routinely evicted under the pretext of urban order or dismissed as a threat to the health of formal economies.\n\nDid that result in any significant change in terms of the challenges that we are seeing? I think its a big no, Wadzai says.\n\nAt times, vendors resort to bribing officers to avoid the disruption of evictions. Jesman Guvheya has worked as an informal vendor for two years. The widowed mother of five says the police sometimes demand US$1 a day from each vendor.\n\nBut there can be three or four groups that move at different times per day and you may end up paying 4 US dollars to avoid being raided, she says.\n\nAnd that bribe is never a guarantee one will trade without interruption. The police could swoop in and confiscate everything, even after a vendor has paid the bribe. Sometimes we are left with little stock that we will have secured elsewhere, she says, preparing to flee from police she has just spotted.\n\nAlthough Guvheya escaped arrest that day, her son, also a street vendor, wasnt as fortunate. The council police apprehended him, and she had to follow the truck to pay a bribe so he could be freed.\n\nLinda Mujuruis a Global Press Journal reporter-in-residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.\n\nGamuchirai Masiyiwais a Global Press Journal reporter-in-residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.\n\nGlobal Press Journal delivers bold, investigative and in-depth explanatory reporting on the worlds most urgent issues.\n\n",

The Times had no obvious motive to favor Livelys version of events.\n\nIn a statement shared with US media, Livelys lawyers called the opinion a total victory and a complete vindication for Blake Lively, along with those that Justin Baldoni and the Wayfarer Parties dragged into their retaliatory lawsuit, including Ryan Reynolds, Leslie Sloane and The New York Times.\n\nAs we have said from day one, this $400 million lawsuit was a sham, and the Court saw right through it, her lawyers said.\n\nThe BBC has contacted Baldonis lawyers for comment.\n\nJudge Liman said Baldoni would be allowed to amend and refile his allegations related to interference with contracts by 23 June.\n\nJudge Limans dismissal comes a week after Lively asked to withdraw two of the claims in her suit against Baldoni  intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress.\n\nIn the original lawsuit, she claimed she experienced severe emotional distress in response to the alleged sexual harassment and smear campaign.\n\nIt Ends With Us is an adaption of a best-selling Colleen Hoover novel, which features Blake Lively as the main character, Lily Bloom, a young woman who grew up witnessing domestic abuse and finds herself in the same position years later.\n\n",
