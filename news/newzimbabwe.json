The companys goal is to match or surpass this standard with its remaining properties, including Elephant Hills Resort and the Holiday Inns.\n\nEncouragingly, guest feedback, particularly from foreign visitors, has been very positive, and this is gradually translating into increased bookings. Plans are afoot to acquire significant interest in other hospitality assets, including a possible new build,which plans will come to the fore once all processes and regulatory requirements are in placeand funds are available from the disposal of the non-strategic properties, added Mhishi.\n\n",

However, the defendants failed to provide valid importation documents. Further verification revealed that the SAD 500 form and invoice they presented were fraudulent as they did not exist in the SARS system. During the trial, both accused pleaded guilty and were convicted as charged, said Malabi-Dzhangi.\n\nIn aggravating the sentence, Advocate Phumudzo Mudau argued that the accused committed a serious and prevalent offence in the courts jurisdiction.\n\nThey showed no remorse, the high value of theillicit goodsnecessitated a strong deterrent message to potential offenders, there is public demand for harsher sentences in such cases, and the court granted the states request for a custodial sentence and imposed the following penalties: five years of direct imprisonment.\n\nAdvocate Ivy Thenga, Director of Public Prosecutions, praised the sentence, saying it sends a clear message to potential criminals participating inillegal trading.\n\nShe also praised the work of Advocates Phumudzo Mudau and Tebogo Mothapo, as well as the investigating officer, Sergeant Mmametse Sophina Lehodi of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations (Hawks).\n\n",

We need to exercise empathy and restraint as we move towards eradicating mass poverty in our homeland.\n\nIn a scathing announcement of the impending clampdown, local government minister Daniel Garwe on Wednesday accused vendors of perpetuating unsanitary conditions, worsening public health issues and creating a haven for criminal activities.\n\nGovernment is directing all local authorities to clear vendors from undesignated points within 48 hours, said Garwe.\n\nA high unemployment rate and increasing levels of poverty, exceeding half of the population, have forced Zimbabweans, including graduates, onto the streets.\n\nWith few to no opportunities, the young and old have opted to survive by illegally selling goods in urban areas, including vegetables, second-hand clothes delivered via Mozambique from Europe, cooked food such as chicken feet, cigarettes, and sweets.\n\nAdded Gutu: Most of these vendors are young people, young mothers and fathers as well as young school leavers and college graduates.\n\nThe formal job sector, particularly in the private sector, has been steadily shrinking over the years and as such, the majority of job seekers (mostly people in the prime years of their lives), simply cannot secure jobs in the formal sector.\n\nThe default mode will be for them to resort to the informal sector to sustain their livelihoods. As a result, we find our streets flooded with these young vendors who are trying to erk out a decent living.\n\nPut bluntly, massive vending as we are currently witnessing it, is a direct result of desperation as opposed to people just trying to be unruly and disorderly.\n\nPast efforts to rid the capital Harare and other centres such as Bulawayo of illegal vendors have failed.\n\nCouncils have either given up or totally lost the battle to the over a million illegal vendors across various cities.\n\nThe latest round, first announced by Harare City Council and later government, was expected to have started Wednesday evening.\n\n",

Its effectively a lie and the only reason Mr. Carter is even involved in this is because she was pushed to involve him.\n\nIn a sworn declaration, the accuser has insisted she stands by her claims and only dropped her lawsuit due to fear of intimidation and retaliation from Jay-Z and his fans.\n\nShe denied telling the investigators Buzbee had sought her out as a client or encouraged her to pursue a false claim but argued she felt intimidated and terrified at being confronted on her doorstep.\n\nBut Spiro insisted the investigators didnt coerce or threaten the woman.\n\nHe said: She voluntarily met and spoke to them and she told them her truth, which was under no circumstances did Mr. Carter do this, and number two the only reason hes even involved in this is she was pushed to introduce him by a lawyer.\n\nMr. Carter doesnt know Jane Doe, never met Jane Doe. Theres no truth to any of this.\n\nJay is suing both his accuser and her lawyer for defamation, which they have denied, and is ready to move forward with his life.\n\nHis lawyer said: Its tough to hear a false lie said about you, spread through the internet, and affecting your children.\n\nIts tough on him. Its tough on anybody. But what he does is he proves himself innocent. Today is hopefully the final chapter in that. And then theyre gonna move forward. Thats what Jay does.\n\nThe truth had to fully come out. This person cannot be allowed to sort of hide from the reality that this was a false accusation.\n\nIn Jays lawsuit, he claimed the allegations of rape against him were knowingly false and malicious and accused the woman and his lawyers of having launched to extort him through a menacing private demand letter.\n\n",

They want to take money and put it into the pocketno safety for Zimbabweans and no compliance.\n\nRoads need to be maintained, police officers need to be paid by the government, where is the money coming from? The next thing is, you say the government is not providing a service; what contribution have you made?\n\nSo, first and foremost, all kombis must be registered, and kombi operators must lead by example in their operations by being responsible Zimbabweans, said the ZRP spokesman.\n\nOn enforcement of the law, Nyathi said all police officers are under instructions to carry out their duties professionally in accordance with police standards.\n\nZRP will take action against any police officer who will try to endanger the lives of Zimbabweans, Nyathi added.\n\nIn some instances, police officers have been blamed for road traffic accidents as they smash windscreens and chase after fleeing commuter omnibuses.\n\nMotorists were urged to comply with police officers and avoid running away. Also, Nyathi warned members of the public who try to interfere with police officers on duty.\n\nWhen you are arrested, you are not being killed. Youre simply being taken in to ensure the law takes its course. Why do you want to run away? Comply with the law; if you have to go to court, go to court and if you have to pay a fine, pay the fine, and go back to your business, Nyathi cautioned.\n\nThe ZRP Commissioner Paul Nyathi has urged the public not to board unregistered kombis as they are not insured.pic.twitter.com/sIKV4cHbKq\n\n NewZimbabwe.com (@NewZimbabweCom)March 12, 2025\n\nThe clampdown on unregistered kombis will be implemented without fear or favour, he added.\n\nThere is no going back in enforcing the governments law, and we are unapologetic about that, he said.\n\nOn corruption, Nyathi said bribe-taking police officers will be arrested alongside the motorists paying them off.\n\n",

Therefore, no other business entity outside the interbank market should determine the exchange rate.\n\nThe February 2025 Monetary Policy Statement again provided clarity that the 5% trading margin communicated in previous Interbank Foreign Exchange Trading Guidelines was only applicable for the determination of the starting exchange rate at the introduction of ZWG, he said.\n\nMushayavanhu added that banks are free to on-sell foreign currency purchased from willing sellers (including the RBZ) at a margin consistent with international best practices.\n\n",
