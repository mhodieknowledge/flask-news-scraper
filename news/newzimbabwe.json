            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe Zimbabwe Agricultural Show (ZAS) is set to make a big splash with a surge in both exhibitors and exciting new events, as it gears up for its 115th edition.\n\nIn a press briefing, ZAS CEO Rufaro Gunundu shared that 85% of exhibitors have already set up their stands, with 505 confirmed participantsup from 480 during the same period last year.\n\nThis growth is further reflected in the space occupied: a total of 79,500 square meters have been secured, surpassing last years 72,363 square meters, thanks to increased investments in Zimbabwes agricultural sector.\n\nIn a significant addition this year, ZAS will host its inaugural Golf Tournament this Friday at the Royal Harare Golf Club.\n\nThe event aims to raise funds for agricultural development programs. Gunundu emphasised that the tournament is not just a game, but a platform to support the next generation of agribusiness leaders.\n\nProceeds will benefit two key initiatives: the ZAS Master Farmer Training Programme, designed to equip farmers with critical skills and boost their confidence, and the ZAS Scholarship Programme, which offers financial assistance to students pursuing diplomas in agriculture, horticulture, and animal science, he said.\n\nIn addition to the tournament, attendees will be treated to a thrilling performance by the international Backsplit Performance Bikers, known for their high-energy, precision biking displays.\n\nGunundu described the event as a unique mix of sport and agricultural advocacy, promising an unforgettable experience while highlighting the bright future of Zimbabwes agricultural community.\n\n",

We are finally free after a whole year of persecution. It only strengthened our resolve, Sitima said after the acquittal.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has thrown out an urgent bid by a Congolese national seeking immediate release from Harare Remand Prison, ruling that his detention is lawful under the countrys immigration laws.\n\nBenoit Ombeni Mupenzi, who claims to be a refugee in Zimbabwe, had argued that his incarceration was unlawful as he had not been informed of the reasons for his arrest nor shown a valid warrant.\n\nHe told the court that his liberty was being arbitrarily restrained, causing irreparable harm and insisted he was unaware of any offence committed.\n\nSitting at the Harare High Court, Justice Fatima Maxwell held that authorities were acting within the law.\n\nCiting section 8(1) of the Immigration Act [Chapter 4:02], the judge said, The detention of the applicant is in terms of a law which remains in our statute books. Until and unless section 8 of the Immigration Act is declared unconstitutional and such declaration is confirmed by the Constitutional Court, the courts hands are tied.\n\nThe provision gives immigration authorities up to 14 days to verify an individuals identity, nationality and antecedents.\n\nThe Chief Immigration Officer opposed Mupenzis release, stating that his nationality was still under investigation and that none of the documents he presented substantiated his claim to refugee status.\n\nApplicants identity and nationality status have been questioned by the countrys security apparatus, the court was told.\n\nThe judge acknowledged Mupenzis complaint over not being given reasons for his detention, but made it clear that release was not the remedy. Whilst applicant might have a genuine grievance that he was not furnished with reasons for the arrest and detention forthwith, I am not persuaded that the remedy for that is his immediate release, she said.\n\nThere was no order regarding costs.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nOPPOSITION legislator Zivai Mhetu has urged the government to scrap passport requirements for countries within the SADC region in order to promote trade, tourism, and labour mobility.\n\nMhetu told Speaker Jacob Mudenda during a point of national interest on Tuesday that Zimbabwe and its neighbours should adopt a system similar to the European Schengen visa, which allows free travel between member states using only ID cards.\n\nSchengen countries in Europe have boosted trade and mobility through the introduction of the Schengen visa, enabling citizens to travel freely within member states using just ID cards. Closer to home, Namibia and Zambia have recently implemented a similar system, removing the need for passports when travelling between their countries, the Epworth North MP said.\n\nHe further argued that such agreements would ease immigration challenges faced by Zimbabweans and other nationalities living in SADC countries without proper documentation.\n\nFollowing these developments, my prayer is that Zimbabwe does the same to enhance trade, tourism, and labour mobility, while advancing intra-African commerce in line with the African Continental Free Trade Area and SADCs vision of free movement. I urge government to pursue similar agreements with neighbours such as Mozambique, Botswana, Zambia, Malawi, Namibia, and South Africa, to allow our citizens to travel, work, and trade more freely, thereby strengthening both economic opportunities and regional unity, he added.\n\nIn response, Lands Minister Masuka said the government was currently engaging Botswana on the issue, with plans to have the same arrangement with more countries across Africa.\n\nMasuka could, however, not provide a timeline for when the discussions will be concluded, citing that the negotiations involve others (countries), hence deadlines cannot be imposed.\n\nI know that there are current discussions with Botswana, for example, to ensure that movement is enhanced. You will recall that we already have a UniVisa for the KAZA area. So, such negotiations with other countries will continue.\n\nI hope that, eventually, the citizens of African countries will be able to travel freely to the 54 African nations. We have made a start to gather momentum in order to accelerate this regional integration that is already in motion and led by our President, he said.\n\n",
