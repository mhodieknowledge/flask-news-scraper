            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nPrimary and Secondary Education Minister Torerayi Moyo says his ministry has given unregistered schools until December 31, 2025, to regularise their operations or risk closure.\n\nResponding to questions in Parliament during a Wednesday Question and Answer session, Moyo said government had extended a four-month grace period for illegal private schools and colleges to comply.\n\nHe explained that authorities were cautious not to disadvantage learners who had already registered for examinations, hence the extension to the end of the year or early 2026.\n\nZanu PF legislator for Mt Pleasant, George Mashavave, had asked whether government had a policy framework to monitor and regularise the mushrooming of unregistered schools and colleges across the country.\n\nMoyo confirmed the existence of such a framework and stressed the need to act carefully.\n\nWe have given illegal schools a grace period of four months because we did not want to close them haphazardly, as this would disadvantage learners and violate their fundamental right to education.\n\nI want to assure this august House that very soon in November, or perhaps early next year, we may extend to January 2026. Come January, however, those schools still operating illegally and failing to regularise will be closed, said Moyo.\n\nThe minister admitted that unregistered schools were mushrooming countrywide but insisted that the ministrys Schools Psychological Services and Special Needs Education (SPPRS) department was responsible for school registration and providing technical advice to prospective investors.\n\nHe said circulars had already been sent out warning directors of illegal schools.\n\nI have made a clarion call to those directors of illegal schools to regularise their operations or face penalties at our disposal. All schools that are not registered are operating illegally. While we have avoided immediate closures to protect learners, the grace period expires on December 31, after which circulars will be enforced, and closures implemented, he added.\n\nMoyo also highlighted the governments progress in addressing the countrys school infrastructure deficit.\n\nAccording to a 2022 survey, Zimbabwe required 3,000 additional schools. Since then, more than 600 have been constructed.\n\nFrom 2022 to date, we have built over 600 schools. This year alone, we are targeting at least 200 more, he said.\n\nHowever, Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) MP Ellen Shiriyedenga argued that the school deficit could be fuelling the growth of illegal institutions.\n\nWe were told there is a deficit of 3,000 schools. This gap may be the reason for mushrooming schools, as children should not have to walk long distances. How far has the ministry gone in addressing this deficit? she asked.\n\nOther MPs raised concerns about exploitation, quality of education, and adherence to government policy in unregistered institutions.\n\nZanu PF legislator Clemence Chiduwa questioned whether private schools were being monitored to ensure local languages were taught at primary level.\n\nIn response, Moyo said this was precisely why government insisted on registration.\n\nOur policy is clear, schools must regularise so that we can monitor compliance, including adherence to curriculum and language policy. As it stands, we do not know what is happening in many backyards where illegal schools exist. That is why registration is critical, he said.\n\n",

For example, a supermarket must obtain separate bakery, butchery, restaurant, and liquor licences to operate fully.\n\nNcube, who last year told the Womens Prosperity Conference that his wife had presented him with a long list of licences required before opening her restaurant, admitted the system was excessive.\n\nOn the issue of licences, I totally agree with what women in business are saying. Just recently, my wife showed me a very long list of licences she had to pay before opening a restaurant in Bulawayo. Its just too much for a single business, Ncube said at the time, promising urgent reforms.\n\nNcube on Wednesday unveiled a raft of measures aimed at reducing the cost of doing business and improving Zimbabwes competitiveness.\n\nThe first tranche, which is targeting the agricultural value chain, has seen the requirement for a Small Scale Farmers registration fees of US$500 being scrapped, while the Dairy Processor Registration of US$350 per annum being reduced to a once-off US$50.\n\nFeed manufacturing registration fees were reduced from US$250 to US$20 while livestock movement clearance which attracted US$10 per herd, will now require US$5 per herd.\n\nThe livestock genetics import permit, which was pegged at US$100 will now attract just US$20 while the meat export registration, which was pegged at US$500 will now attract US$100.\n\nOther measures include scrapping food handler certificate fees and capping Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) costs at 0.05% of project value, with a maximum of US$100,000.\n\nThe Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA) livestock levy, biosafety permit, and the CBCA certificate are also among the charges that have been scrapped.\n\nThese reforms are part of governments commitment to ease the cost of doing business and create a more competitive economic environment, Ncube said.\n\nNew Licensing Fees\n\n",

            "content": "The Guardian\n\nAuthorities in the US were still searching for a suspect in the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, hours after the close ally ofDonald Trumpwas killed at a Utah university, sparking condemnation from both sides of politics and grave threats from the president.\n\nThis shooting is still an active investigation, theUtahdepartment of public safety said in a statement, adding it was working with the FBI and local police departments.\n\nTwo suspects were taken into custody, but subsequently released. The Governor of Utah, Spencer Cox, called it a political assassination, despite the motive and identity of the shooter remaining unclear.\n\nBeau Mason, the commissioner of Utahs department of public safety, said investigators were reviewing security camera images of the suspect, who wore dark clothing and possibly fired a longer distance shot from a roof.\n\nIn a video message from the Oval Office, Trump vowed that his administration would track down the suspect.\n\nMy administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organisations that fund it and support it, Trump said.\n\nKirkwas shot while addressing a crowdof an estimated 3,000 people at Utah Valley University in Orem, near Salt Lake City. Video footage posted online showed Kirk being questioned by an audience member about gun violencein the moments before he was shot.\n\nVideo footage shows students scrambling to run from the sound of gunfire. Kirk was transported to a nearby hospital, where he later died, authorities said.\n\nLocal officials said the shooting was believed to be a targeted attack by a shooter from the roof of a building.\n\nHis death prompted outrage from Democrats and Republicans, while the president ordered flags to be lowered to half mast to honour him.\n\nThis is a dark day for our state. Its a tragic day for our nation, Cox, a Republican, said at a press conference, appealing for an end to the political violence.\n\nKirkwas the co-founder of Turning Point USA, the largest conservative youth organisation in the country which, played a key role in driving young voter support for Trump in November.\n\nHis appearances on podcasts and across social media brought him fame and notoriety, as he helped to amplify the presidents agenda. Kirk frequently attacked the mainstream media and engaged with culture-war issues around race, gender and immigration, often in a provocative style.\n\nThe event in Utah on Wednesday was the first in his American Comeback Tour at universities around the country. He often used such events, which typically drew large crowds of students, to invite attendees to debate him live.\n\nExperts have warned his death marks a watershed moment, with fears it could inflame an already fractured country and inspire more unrest.\n\nTrump, who routinely describes political rivals and others who stand in his way as radical left lunatics who pose an existential threat to the nation, decried violent political rhetoric in his statement on Wednesday night.\n\nViolence and murder are the tragic consequences of demonising those you disagree with  For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the worlds worst mass murderers and criminals, he said.\n\nPromising to crackdown on political violence, the president cited recent incidents including the attempts on his life last year, the killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson and the 2017 shooting of Republican congressman Steve Scalise.\n\nThe presidents list notably did not include violence against Democrats, such asthe murder of Melissa Hortman, a Minnesota state lawmaker, and her husband, or the attack on former House speakerNancy Pelosis husband.\n\nFormer president Barack Obama condemned political violence as despicable, while sending his prayers to Kirks wife and two young children. Joe Biden said there was no no place in our country for this kind of violence.\n\nHakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House minority leader, expressed a similar sentiment: Political violence of any kind and against any individual is unacceptable and completely incompatible with American values.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, an attempt to observe a moment of silence for Kirk on the floor of the House of Representatives degenerated into shouting and finger-pointing. Republican representative Anna Paulina Luna, who worked as Kirks director of Hispanic engagement at Turning Point USA yelled at Democrats, telling them You caused this!\n\nThat prompted Democratic representative Jahana Hayes, a leader on the gun violence prevention taskforce, to shout: Pass some gun laws!\n\nThe US is undergoing its most sustained period of political violence since the 1970s, according to data compiled by the Reuters news agency, which has documented more than 300 cases of politically motivated violent acts since supporters of Trump attacked the US Capitol on 6 January 6 2021.\n\nIn the first six months of the year, the US experienced about 150 politically motivated attacks, nearly twice as many as over the same period last year, Mike Jensen, a researcher at the University of Maryland, told Reuters.\n\nI think we are in a very, very dangerous spot right now that could quite easily escalate into more widespread civil unrest if we dont get a hold of it, Jensen said. This could absolutely serve as a kind of flashpoint that inspires more of it.\n\nWith Reuters\n\n",

The drugs had an estimated street value of US$96.20.\n\nChambati admitted the charge and was convicted, but the magistrate gave her a suspended jail term and 420 hours of community service, citing her guilty plea, remorse and her status as a mother.\n\nJustice Muremba said the magistrate misapplied the Criminal Procedure (Sentencing Guidelines) Regulations, 2023, which set a presumptive penalty of three years imprisonment for cases involving large quantities of drugs or possession in public spaces.\n\nThe sentence imposed was not only inconsistent with the regulatory framework but also failed to reflect the structured approach intended to promote fairness, proportionality, and consistency in sentencing, Justice Muremba ruled.\n\nMuremba criticised the magistrates view that 962.6g was a small amount, saying precedent showed even 700g warranted prison time. Citing past cases, the judge said: Quantities well below this threshold constitute substantial amounts.\n\nThe judge stressed that being caught at a busy shopping mall aggravated the offence: Possession of dangerous drugs in a public setting attracts the presumptive penalty of three years imprisonment.\n\nWhile confirming Chambatis conviction, Justice Muremba refused to certify the sentence, leaving the door open for a harsher penalty.\n\nLenient sentences such as community service for possession of nearly a kilogram of dagga fall short of the justice systems duty to protect society, she warned.\n\n",

            "content": "ByPeter Fabricius,Daily Maverick\n\nSince his arrest on 13 April, Wellington Masiwa has been in prison for illegally entering South Africa and for alleged fraud in Zimbabwe.\n\nZimbabwean opposition activists believe the South African authorities are colluding with Zimbabwes ruling Zanu-PF party to extradite a vocal critic of the Zimbabwean government from South Africa to Zimbabwe.\n\nWellington Masiwa, aka Comrade Nyokayemabhunu, has been detained in the Johannesburg Correctional Centre since he was arrested on 13 April for illegally entering South Africa and for alleged fraud in Zimbabwe.\n\nBefore that, he was held and assaulted by unknown men in an unknown place, according to his legal representatives.\n\nWhen he appeared in the Randburg Magistrates Court on 30 April on an illegal immigration charge, his lawyers were surprised when an Interpol representative showed up and laid new charges against him based on an extradition request from the Zimbabwean government.\n\nWhen the representative appeared in court at a later hearing in July, the crowd of opposition Zimbabwean citizens supporting Masiwa grew angry, suspecting new charges were being brought against him.\n\nSouth Africas justice minister, Mmamoloko Kubayi, is expected to rule this week on whether Masiwa is extraditable.\n\nThe extradition notice from Zimbabwes deputy prosecutor-general, Nelson Mutsonziwa, certified that Zimbabwe wanted him returned to serve an 18-month sentence for defrauding a fellow Zimbabwean, Prince Kutivo, of $3,660 in a fraudulent property deal in Harare.\n\nThis request is not being pursued for political reasons or any ulterior purpose, Mutsonziwa insisted.\n\nHowever, there are many anomalies in the case which cast doubt on Mutsonziwas assurances. For instance, another alleged fraud case against Masiwa has arisen. Masiwa says that he was arrested through a trap set by Zimbabwes notorious Central Intelligence Organisation and sprung by a fellow Zimbabwean activist, Honest Sibanda.\n\nThis appears to be another name for Honest Shumba, who has formally charged Masiwa with cheating him of some R24,000, which he paid Masiwa in Harare in July 2024 for a couch which Masiwa never delivered.\n\nMasiwa flatly denies the deal and says he was in South Africa when the transaction allegedly occurred.\n\nMasiwas attorney, Yugeshnee Govender, told Daily Maverick the prosecution had been unable to produce bank statements to prove Shumba paid this money into Masiwas bank account. The Zimbabwean government has not mentioned the Shumba case in its request for extradition.\n\nMasiwa, his lawyers and his opposition comrades believe the Shumba incident was invented to strengthen Zimbabwes case for his extradition. They believe the real reason the Zimbabwe government wants him home is that he has been a strident critic of President Emmerson Mnangagwa, and particularly of his political manoeuvring to try to secure a third term when his second  and constitutionally, final  term expires in 2028.\n\nUntil shortly before his arrest, Masiwa was posting calls on X and other social media, calling on Zimbabweans to join a national shutdown on 31 March to protest at Mnangagwas suspected plans to bypass or amend the Constitution so as to remain in power.\n\nIn an affidavit before the Randburg Magistrates Court seeking bail  which has so far been denied  Masiwa said that before his arrest he had had a WhatsApp channel called Nyokayemabhunu News.\n\nIt had been an important instrument in protest news in Zimbabwe. Masiwa said he was opposed to the campaign for the extension of Mnangagwas presidential term, which had come to be known as 2030 by Zanu-PF.\n\nThe extension is not in terms of the Zimbabwean Constitution, he said, insisting he had only advocated for peaceful means to stop the illegal subversion of the Zimbabwean Constitution by the ruling party in Zimbabwe, Zanu-PF. It is for this reason that I have been declared an enemy of the state by the Zimbabwean government and Zanu-PF.\n\nZanu-PF has called several press conferences to celebrate my arrest in South Africa and have indicated that they would want to charge me with terrorism for illegally attempting to remove a constitutionally elected government  which carries the death penalty.\n\nThe Progressive Zimbabwean Foundation, which says it represents numerous progressive forces and pressure groups, issued a statement in August expressing concern that Zimbabwes request for the extradition of Masiwa was political rather than legal.\n\nThe circumstances surrounding Cde Nyokayemabhunus arrest and detention raise serious concerns about the separation of politics from the justice system, particularly in a foreign nation like South Africa, said the foundations General Sithole.\n\nHe added that remarks by Zanu-PFs secretary for information and publicity, Chris Mutsvangwa, further reinforces the notion that this is a political matter.\n\nDuring a press conference at Zanu-PF headquarters in Harare on 8 May, Mutsvangwa said Zanu-PF was very happy that South Africa had taken steps to show that it was not prepared to tolerate Zanu-PFs critics using South Africa as a platform for their criticism.\n\nMentioning Nyokayemabhunu by name, he said, Some people have got the mistaken idea that you can go and be hosted in South Africa and start shouting bad things about Zimbabwe and talking subversion.\n\nThey have got a new comeuppance by South African laws. They are being told: Not here. We are a sister republic to Zimbabwe. We fought with Zanu-PF. We know each other. This is not your home.\n\nMutsvangwa said he hoped the legal action that South Africa was taking against Masiwa is a signal to others who are spewing hatred and vituperation  about Zanu-PF and our leader that South Africa cant tolerate. It cant be a home for vitriol against Zimbabwe.\n\nHowever, South African Police Service Captain Willem van der Heever testified, in a court affidavit responding to Masiwa, that the conviction in Zimbabwe has nothing to do with the political climate in Zimbabwe.\n\nVan der Heever said he was Interpols investigating officer in this matter, stationed at the Interpol extradition desk in Pretoria and that he had received Zimbabwes request for extradition through Interpol and had obtained a warrant for Masiwas arrest from the Kempton Park Magistrates Court on the basis of it on 29 April.\n\nVan der Heever cited deputy prosecutor-general Mutsonziwas certificate stating that Zimbabwe was only seeking Masiwas extradition to serve an 18-month sentence in the 2016 case for fraud against Kutivo.\n\nYet in his affidavit Van der Heever also cited Honest Shumbas alleged couch fraud complaint.\n\nGovender told Daily Maverick that Masiwa and his legal team were waiting for Justice Minister Kubayi to decide whether Masiwas case was extraditable. Govender said she believed the amount of the alleged fraud involved in this case was not great enough to warrant extradition.\n\nGovender said Kubayis ruling on this might be announced when Masiwa appeared in court again on 10 September. Masiwa said he fled Zimbabwe in 2017, fearing for his safety after being beaten by government agents after Mnangagwa ousted President Robert Mugabe in a coup.\n\nMasiwa now lives in Gqeberha with his wife and is a granite cutter. He has applied for political asylum in South Africa, but his court cases have interrupted his application.DM\n\n",
