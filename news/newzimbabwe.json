The fund draws its capital from balance-of-payments surpluses, foreign currency operations, privatisation proceeds, fiscal savings, and natural resource revenues.\n\nIn an update this week, Mutapa Fund CEO Dr. John Mangudya said the latest funding marks significant progress in efforts to restructure and strengthen the performance of critical SOEs.\n\nThis funding is designed to enhance the performance of parastatals and align them with the national economic agenda, said Dr. Mangudya. Among the entities benefiting from this support are the Cold Storage Company (CSC), which recently emerged from corporate rescue, ZUPCO, Silo Foods, and the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ), among others.\n\nSince its inception, the Mutapa Fund has played a central role in revitalising distressed parastatals, particularly by steering the CSC out of corporate rescue and improving governance and operational efficiency across several other enterprises.\n\nThe fund manages a diversified portfolio of state-owned companies, grouped into key economic clusters, including mineral resources, energy and trading, ICT, transport and logistics, agriculture and industry, financial services, and real estate.\n\nThrough these targeted investments, the Mutapa Investment Fund continues to anchor Zimbabwes broader strategy for state enterprise reform, economic stability, and sustainable growth.\n\n",

It will feature exhibitions, investment sessions, expert panel discussions, and will conclude with an awards gala celebrating outstanding achievers in the diaspora.\n\nDescribed as a premier diaspora engagement platform, the event has become an important avenue for companies and organisations seeking to expand into both the local and diaspora markets.\n\nThe organisers said the summit will bring together prospective investors while recognising individuals making notable contributions to the countrys progress.\n\nThe 3rd Edition of the Zimbabwe Diaspora Celebration & Business Summit is more than a gathering; it is a national initiative celebrating the indispensable role of Zimbabweans abroad in driving economic transformation.\n\nAccording to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, the diaspora community remitted an impressive US$2.2 billion in 2024, up from US$1.873 billion in 2023. This growth underscores the diasporas unwavering commitment to Zimbabwes socio-economic progress, said ZIDO chaiperson Blessed Kapesa.\n\nAn estimated 300 in-person participants and thousands of online viewers from around the world are expected to take part in the event.\n\nWith an expected attendance of at least 300 in-person participants and thousands of online viewers worldwide, the summit is strategically scheduled during the festive season, when many Zimbabweans in the diaspora return home.\n\nThis hybrid platform will enable participants to showcase their products, services, and investment opportunities to a global audience, amplifying visibility and engagement, he added.\n\n",

He reportedly approached a security officer manning the main gate and suddenly attempted to snatch his SKS rifle while shouting, Where is ED? I want to see ED.\n\nA scuffle ensued as the guard wrestled with Ruvheneko before another officer, Private Mupfumira, intervened to subdue him. During the struggle, the accused was injured on his left hand by the bayonet attached to the firearm.\n\nThe accused was arrested while in the process of committing the offence, and there are eyewitnesses who will testify linking him to the crime, the State told the court.\n\nHe was later taken to Five Avenue Police Station, where a report was filed. The State opposed bail, arguing that Ruvheneko has no known address or relatives and may interfere with witnesses if released.\n\n",

His WhatsApp number was also not receiving messages.\n\nIt is with a heavy heart that I tender my resignation from Ibhetshu LikaZulu, effective immediately, reads Sibandas letter to Fuzwayo.\n\nThis decision comes after deep reflection on the current direction and approach the organisation has taken in the struggle against Zanu PF.\n\nUnfortunately, I find that this route diverges from my own beliefs, principles, and the foundational values that Ibhetshu LikaZulu has long stood for.\n\nThis is not an easy decision. Ibhetshu LikaZulu has been a home of conscience and courage  a movement that stood firmly with the oppressed and gave voice to the voiceless.\n\nSibanda and Fuzwayo had been comrades in arms for years, in the trenches against first late President Robert Mugabe and his harsh Zanu PF regime to the current.\n\nA resolution by Zanu PF last year mandated the partys secretary for justice to initiate the process that will extend Mnangagwas second and final term, which is supposed to end in 2028. The party wants it lengthened to 2030.\n\nThe involvement of exiled former minister in Mugabes government, Jonathan Moyo, has raised the stakes as he is a known strategist and thinker.\n\nThe resolution, which has threatened to split the revolutionary institution and riddled it with factional fights, was reinforced at its recent Peoples Conference hosted in Mutare.\n\n",
