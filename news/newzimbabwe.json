This year, producers are setting their sights on exporting blueberries to China, one of the worlds largest and most lucrative markets.\n\nHARARE, Sept. 25 (Xinhua)  Inside a greenhouse located in ZimbabwesMashonaland West Province, workers carefully hand-pick fresh blueberries from lush green shrubs, ensuring only the best fruit makes it to the baskets.\n\nIn recent years, Zimbabwes blueberry industry has grown rapidly, bringing local farmers higher incomes. This year, producers are setting their sights on exporting blueberries to China, one of the worlds largest and most lucrative markets.\n\nEarlier this month, Zimbabwe signed a trade agreement allowing fresh blueberry exports to China, a move farmers say will spur production to meet the surge in demand.\n\nIt is a huge market. They are the biggest exporters of blueberries, among the biggest growers of blueberries, and also one of the biggest importers of blueberries. So, it really has taken off there, said Alistair Campbell, a blueberry farmer from the province.\n\nSupported by favorable climate conditions, increased agricultural investment, and rising demand for this healthy food, Zimbabwes blueberry industry is expanding. According to the countrys Horticultural Development Council (HDC), production is expected to rise from 8,000 metric tons in 2024 to 12,000 metric tons in 2025.\n\nFarmers believe that Zimbabwes strategic geographic location  allowing early access to global markets  gives the country a competitive edge. Our product is well received. We get big, nice-tasting berries. And its well-received in the market thus far. We just need more scale, more blueberries, Campbell said, adding that the opportunity to export to China positions Zimbabwe as a significant player in blueberry production.\n\nWe really need to get things moving pretty quickly. We hope to have some really good engagements with government to see what we can get done there, and also with funders to make sure that we get enough plants in the ground to satisfy at least a part of that Chinese market, he added.\n\nIn a statement following the signing of the blueberry export agreement, the HDC called for policies to increase investment, expand production to required volumes, and ensure that Zimbabwes blueberries consistently meet Chinas quality and phytosanitary standards.\n\nJoseph Kakoto, president of the Zimbabwe Young Farmers Association for Sustainable Development, a youth-led organization, expressed optimism about the growth prospects of the Chinese export market, saying the protocol would attract new investment in plantations, packhouses, and cold chain infrastructure, creating jobs along the value chain.\n\nThis protocol is a win-win. Zimbabwe gains access to a lucrative market, while China secures reliable food imports, Kakoto told Xinhua.\n\nThe deal, he said, signals Zimbabwes entry into high-value horticultural exports such as blueberries, opening the door to greater foreign currency earnings and investment.\n\nI am very confident about the Chinese market because it is huge and steadily growing with a rising middle class that demands healthy premium foods such as blueberries. Zimbabwes climate and soil are highly suitable for premium berries, giving us a competitive edge, he said.\n\n",

The party is disintegrated.\n\nChidawa further questioned why Mpofus name was absent from the dossier, suggesting this as evidence that Mpofu had an idea of its source.\n\nWhy is his name not being mentioned in the dossier?\n\nOn Monday, Zanu PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa stated that the politburo did not discuss the dossier at length, claiming its originator was unknown but believed to be based in South Africa.\n\nThe dossier, which Mutsvangwa said the politburo barely acknowledged, included names such as controversial business tycoons Wicknell Chivayo and Kudakwashe Tagwirei. Vice President Constantino Chiwenga reportedly questioned Mnangagwa as to why those named as corrupt had not been arrested.\n\nChidawa also claimed that Zanu PFs grassroots support in the Matebeleland Provinces erupted in celebration upon hearing news of Mpofus demotion.\n\nPeople are celebrating. There are celebrations in Matebeleland. We are talking of the downfall of a man who owns many big buildings in Bulawayo and Victoria Falls, he said.\n\nThe Zanu PF succession war is reaching a new crescendo as factions aligned to Mnangagwa and Chiwenga vie for power.\n\n",
