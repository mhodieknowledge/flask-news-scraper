Kubu converted for 18-13 in favour of Kenya at halftime.After the break, Zimbabwe stayed patient until they smelt blood and went for it. With just over 20 minutes remaining, the Sables started forcing mistakes from the Simbas and they took full advantage.From a maul, Kenyas Bethuel Anami failed to hold onto the ball as the Sables dispossessed him to score before Ian Prior converted for 20-18.Prior then started his final act that killed off Kenya completely. A drop kick from him saw Zimbabwe move ahead 23-18 with the Simbas now struggling with basic ball-handling errors and knock-ons that proved costly.Prior had another penalty for 26-18 in favour of Zimbabwe and with two minutes to go, his kick extinguished Kenya as the Sables moved ahead 29-18.A last-minute try from Teddy Akala was not enough to rescue Kenya as the referee blew the hooter to leave them crestfallen and out of contention for a place at the World Cup.Zimbabwe will now play Namibia in the Africa Cup final on Saturday July 19 with the winner earning a direct ticket to the World Cup while the losers will try their luck via the repechage.For Kenya, it is back to the drawing board yet again with another missed opportunity as a place at the World Cup proves elusive once more.\n\nKenya Simbas dream of earning an early ticket to the 2027 Rugby World Cup in Australia suffered a major setback when they lost 29-23 to Zimbabwe in the Africa Cup semi-final on Sunday.\n\nKenya took on Zimbabwe in the second semi-final at the Namboole grounds in Kampala knowing a place in the final was a stake against Namibia with the winners of the cup set to seal a ticket to the 2027 World Cup.However, they started off badly as Zimbabwe took an early lead although Kenya pulled one back when Eugene Sifuna touched down for 5-5.Zimbabwe would get a penalty shortly after which was well-converted before Kenya went a man down when Griffin Chao was sinbinned for a rough tackle.Kenya Simbas Let Halftime Lead SlipIn the 19th minute, Jone Kubu converted a penalty for Kenya to level the scores 8-8 but Hilton Mudariki gave the Sables a 13-8 lead following his try.Kubu pulled three points back for Kenya with another well-taken kick for 13-11 and on the stroke of halftime, Simbas went ahead when Chao got into space and ran across the pitch to score a try.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE streets of Leeds in the United Kingdom (UK) roared with the sound of resistance this Saturday as Zimbabwean nationals and solidarity groups marched 15 kilometres through the city in a protest against tyranny by President Emmerson Mnangagwa back home.\n\nOrganised by the Zimbabwe Human Rights Organisation (ZHRO), the demonstrations went ahead undeterred by recent threats from Mnangagwas government, with participants singing revolutionary songs and chanting calls for democratic change, standing defiant in the face of intimidation.The walk came in the wake of chilling warnings from Zimbabwean authorities, who have vowed to apply the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Amendment Act (2023) against anyoneinside or outside Zimbabwewho tarnishes the image of the so-called Second Republic. Despite this, participants in Leeds said they would not be silenced.We are not afraid, said one marcher.We will continue to speak out against corruption, nepotism, and oppression.The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) recently confirmed that Blessed Runesu Bombshell Geza, a leading figure in Zimbabwean demonstrations and stay-aways, is now on Interpols watchlist. But rather than deterring action, his listing appears to have further galvanised exiled Zimbabweans and international supporters.The march saw enthusiastic participation from a broad coalition of groups, including members of Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), ZAPU, Mthwakazi Republic Party, and others who joined ZHRO in calling for regime change. Under the blazing summer heat, the spirited crowd kept its energy high, drumming and singing all the way.There was a roar and thunder in Leeds when drums were beaten byParticipants, Ettar Mhlanga and Patson Muzuwa, electrified the atmosphere with energetic drum beating thereby spurring the crowd in a determined move showing that the diaspora community is no longer willing to remain silent.Among the organisers of the walk were, Pamela Magwizi, Mgcini Victor Hlophe, Regina Mahowo, Happiness Ncube, Phylis Melody Magejo, Josephine Jenje-Mudimbu and John Burke.Coordinators Petty Ziramba, Patson Muzuwa, Mavis Mutsvangwa and Shepherd Yuda said the Leeds demonstration was part of a global wave of resistance.In Canada, solidarity protests were led by activist Mellisa Tonderai Tagarira, while in the United States, 19-year-old Bethel Princess Chiyangwa led a demonstration alongside Panashe Vongai Trish Sivindani. In South Africa Jabulani Ndlovu lead a team of 40 people in their quest to be heard.The protestors vowed to continue their campaign until real democratic reform is achieved in Zimbabwe.Fear is no longer an option.

            "content": "By Tapiwa Svondo\n\nOSCAR-nominated American film producer Alix Madigan concluded her week-long Business of Film workshop in Harare, urging the need for a number of formal structures to bolster Zimbabwes film industry.\n\nThe workshop, which was facilitated by the US Embassy, saw Madigan mentoring local filmmakers at the Zimbabwe Film and Television School of Southern Africa (ZIFTESSA).Speaking at the closeout ceremony on Friday, Madigan underscored the need for institutional support such as a film commission and tax incentives to complement the evident local talent.I do think that the future of filmmaking in Zimbabwe is very, very bright and will be very exciting in the years to come.I think if anything, I could recommend, is there be more formal structures in place to support these remarkable filmmakers that are present in this country, things such as the establishment of a film commission, the discussion of a possible tax incentive. But these things do seem to be well underway with the National Arts Council, said Madigan.Becca Archer-Knepper, Public Diplomacy Officer at the U.S. Embassy in Harare, added that challenges in the Zimbabwean film industry are forcing many creatives to pursue opportunities in other international film industries.However, she confirmed that meetings were held with the Ministry of Sport, Arts and Recreation and the National Arts Council to address these challenges.One of the major challenges is a lot of the very creative people end up going other places, whether they go to South Africa or Kenya, or Nigeria, or someplace in Europe or even America to work in the film industry because its more advanced there. And so I think one of the really great things about this workshop is that it brought together a lot of different filmmakers who are keen to build up the industry here in Zimbabwe.There are challenges, but Alix and Dorin Amina Abubakar, whos also on the programme with the American Film showcase, they met with the ministry, they met with the Arts Council, and they discussed different ideas about how they can strengthen the film industry here.There are simple things like making it easier to get film permits to more complex things, like setting up a film hub hub, giving tax breaks and things like that. So, there are some big things and some small things that could really change the film industry here, said Becca.Among the beneficiaries of the workshop was Kudakwashe Rice, a writer, poet, storyteller, and filmmaker, who shared his key takeaways of securing funding, distributing films, and generating returns.I benefited extremely from this programme that I was part of, which was facilitated by the U.S embassy, where they brought in Alix from the United States. Shes an incredible, incredible independent filmmaker, and she got to teach us about the professional aspect of filmmaking and the business aspect of filmmaking as well as being able to find ways where you get to fund your films and also putting your films into distribution and managing to get some returns from that, and to also get returns from that, said Rice.Filmmaker Yeukai Ndirimani, who began her career with Studio 263 in 2002, said the production of films in Zimbabwe is very low and there is little to no money in return.People argue whether we have an industry or not, but we have a community, and we are making films but the rate at which were making productions is very low, and hardly do we ever make money from our films.So this workshop was really very helpful, especially for me, because I am actually currently working on a few productions where I have been trying to find ways to sort of collaborate to to get money to then distribute that content because, its one thing to produce something its another to then get it seen I think my target audience is really like global, so I think this helps because they bring in that global sort of audience so the way that this workshop has helped is that, they have given us resources in terms of orgnisations where we can get our films screened, organisations that fund films people that can partner with us to make films, said Ndirimani.\n\nThe workshop, which was facilitated by the US Embassy, saw Madigan mentoring local filmmakers at the Zimbabwe Film and Television School of Southern Africa (ZIFTESSA).\n\nSpeaking at the closeout ceremony on Friday, Madigan underscored the need for institutional support such as a film commission and tax incentives to complement the evident local talent.I do think that the future of filmmaking in Zimbabwe is very, very bright and will be very exciting in the years to come.I think if anything, I could recommend, is there be more formal structures in place to support these remarkable filmmakers that are present in this country, things such as the establishment of a film commission, the discussion of a possible tax incentive.

And so I think one of the really great things about this workshop is that it brought together a lot of different filmmakers who are keen to build up the industry here in Zimbabwe.There are challenges, but Alix and Dorin Amina Abubakar, whos also on the programme with the American Film showcase, they met with the ministry, they met with the Arts Council, and they discussed different ideas about how they can strengthen the film industry here.There are simple things like making it easier to get film permits to more complex things, like setting up a film hub hub, giving tax breaks and things like that. So, there are some big things and some small things that could really change the film industry here, said Becca.Among the beneficiaries of the workshop was Kudakwashe Rice, a writer, poet, storyteller, and filmmaker, who shared his key takeaways of securing funding, distributing films, and generating returns.I benefited extremely from this programme that I was part of, which was facilitated by the U.S embassy, where they brought in Alix from the United States.

Inmates survive on a single meal daily.During a Question-and-Answer session, Zemura queried government policy on the issue.Is it government policy for people who are in jails to sleep without warm clothes and blankets, without eating, especially during this winter period?I am asking because it seems as if it is now a pattern (norm) people do not have jerseys, blankets and othersZemura was interrupted by the Speaker for using an unacceptable language or word (slang)- pattern.I meant to say, has it become a norm now in Zimbabwe that those who are in jails, whether sentenced or not, suffer from pneumonia as a result of catching a cold? They sleep on dry, cold floors without blankets and mattresses, said Zemura without naming the jail (s).Acting Leader of Government Business in Parliament Anxious Masuka responded that government provided those in prisons with basics but due to the economic challenges, the MP should be specific so that the government can deal with the issues she raised.Government, in its plans, takes those who have been incarcerated for rehabilitation so that they can be reintegrated into society. During the process, the government provides for the basics like food, shelter and clothing.However, when there are challenges, I request that if there is a specific jail, then that communication should be brought forward so that we will be able to address it properly, Masuka said.The Speaker urged the MP to name those prisons without blankets and food.The question should address the jails that do not have blankets, Mudenda said.Before he could finish his statement, Zemura shouted all jails.Mudenda posed a question to the MP before advising her to put her question in writing and to be specific.Did you go to all the jails, Hon. Member? Please put it in writing and be specific as to which jails where there are no blankets, said Mudenda.Most prisons that were visited by a Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs had no blankets and food for inmates.Prisoners complained over a poor diet, surviving on boiled cabbage and sadza once or twice a day.At Chikurubi Maximum Prison, besides being overpopulated, inmates revealed that they had no blankets and most were using blankets supplied by their families or the churches and well-wishers.
