We need decisive leadership, firm timelines, and an unwavering commitment to the rule of law, Ngobeni said.She said while ActionSA supports a humane and orderly approach to immigration, the ongoing pattern of temporary measures has eroded public confidence, undermined border integrity, and perpetuated inequality between citizens and foreign nationals.Ngobeni said the ministers justification that consultations with the Immigration Advisory Board were still ongoing offers no comfort to South Africans who have waited years for decisive action.There is still no clear, time-bound plan to resolve this long-standing issue, leaving our borders porous and our immigration system in disarray, she said.ActionSA has called on Schreiber to publish a comprehensive transition plan with firm deadlines for the conclusion of consultations and implementation of immigration reforms. The party also urged the strengthening of the Border Management Authority and improved internal enforcement to curb illegal immigration.Ngobeni said every further delay deepens social tensions, weakens accountability, and tells law-abiding South Africans that their government lacks the political courage to lead.On Thursday, IOL reported that the Helen Suzman Foundation welcomed the extension of both the Zimbabwean and Lesotho Exemption Permits, saying it would prevent potential humanitarian harm and allow time for a more sustainable policy framework to be developed.According to the Foundation, the extension will allow current ZEP and LEP holders to remain lawfully in South Africa while the minister conducts nationwide consultations. This follows a 2023 Pretoria High Court ruling in which HSF successfully challenged a previous decision to terminate the ZEP programme without prior notice or public consultation.The ministers directive clarifies that ZEP and LEP holders cannot be arrested, detained, or deported under section 34 of the Immigration Act due to an invalid exemption certificate. Holders may also freely enter or depart South Africa under immigration regulations and will not need to produce a valid exemption certificate when applying for another visa category under section 10(2) of the Act.\n\nIn a statement, ActionSA parliamentary chief whip Lerato Ngobeni MP said the extension showed the governments unwillingness to confront South Africas immigration crisis head-on.\n\nSouth Africa does not need endless extensions.

But talk to them today. Talk to the business people today.They will tell you that for the first time theyve kept the ZWG for no less than three months because theyve seen its stability. We have a responsibility as a government to stabilise the ZWG, he said.\n\nHe said once it is stable, those concerns will go as he insisted that business will never be competitive as long as the economy remains stuck with the US dollar.\n\nSo, when we talk about this gradual move, we have them in mind. Its not a reckless move. We know that Zimbabwe has a small population of 16 million which is too small. There is a whole 400 million in SADC (Southern African Development Community), there is COMESA (Common Markets for Eastern nd Southern Africa), there is African Continental Free Trade Area with 1.3 billion people. For us to be able to target those, we have to use our own currency. Thats what we are targeting, he said.\n\nNdlovu added that the migration will be undertaken with due considerations and safeguards as he insisted the country cannot do away with de-dollarisation.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nCONTROVERSIAL tenderpreneur Wicknell Chivayo has warned out-of-favour Bikita South legislator, Energy Mutodi, that he should enjoy his last supper in Parliament, because he will ensure he does not return in 2028.\n\nChivayo, a business tycoon and convicted criminal, jumped to the defence of Ministry of Finance Permanent Secretary George Guvamatanga, after Mutodi accused him of corruption.\n\nWicknell Chivayo\n\nLast week, Mutodi requested that Parliament summons Guvamatanga to answer to corruption charges after allegations emerged that the Treasury head was demanding kickbacks worth millions of US dollars from contractors.\n\nMutodi alleged in Parliament that contractors were unwilling to offer government services because Guvamatanga was demanding kickbacks of between five and 10 percent, threatening to withhold payments if they refused.\n\nFollowing a fierce backlash from his fellow party members, including Politburo members, Mutodi backed down and apologised for calling Guvamatanga a corrupt oligarch.\n\nHowever, this was not enough to save him from being demoted from his position as chairman of the Budget and Finance Parliamentary Portfolio Committee.\n\nMany critics, including lawyers such as Tendai Biti and David Coltart, condemned Mutodis demotion as unconstitutional and a threat to Parliaments oversight role.\n\nThe removal of Energy Mutodi as Chairman of the Budget Committee is the perfect opportunity for opposition MPs to exercise Parliamentary Privilege to speak about the allegations originally leveled by Mutodi against George Guvamatanga and by others against Kuda Tagwireyi, Coltart posted on his X (formerly Twitter) account on Thursday.\n\nColtart urged opposition MPs to rise to the occasion and defend Mutodi, saying his demotion was an attack on Parliamentary privileges. Coltart believes the opposition MPs shouldnt remain silent when such a privilege is attacked before their very eyes.\n\nThis is what parliamentary privilege is all about  it gives MPs a unique opportunity to speak on a public platform, which is recorded in Hansard and thus available to the public, on topics which other citizens cannot do without fear of defamation actions or worse.\n\nUntil now there has generally been a deafening silence from MPs . Now is the time in #Zimbabwe for them to show their mettle and prove that the electorate was justified in placing their trust in this crop of MPs, he added.\n\nIn response, Chivayo told Coltart to recruit Mutodi into their opposition Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) party, because he was no longer wanted in Zanu PF, warning that in 2028 he would make sure Mutodi does not win the Zanu PF primary elections.\n\nMutorei ku CCC kana ku Zanu hatichamudi, as an honourable member trusted with the position of chairman of a portfolio committee we dont expect you speculate or conjecture in Parliament. Kana seat rake next election we will make sure anodyiwa ku ma primary, he posted on his X account Thursday.\n\nCritics were also quick to point out that individuals like Chivayo wouldnt remain silent when their corrupt colleagues, like Guvamatanga, were under attack.\n\nOn social media, people have also suggested that Guvamatanga and Chivayo are part of the same corrupt network, and that an injury to one is an injury to all.\n\nMany also believe that Chivayo is part of a corrupt cartel that Vice President Constantino Chiwenga referred to as Zvigananda  individuals who amass wealth through corruption.\n\n",
