            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nDESPITE threats of termination of contracts, University of Zimbabwe (UZ) lecturers remain defiant, cranking up pressure on government and the institution to increase, tenfold, their salaries to US$2,500 per month.\n\nThe lecturers, who have been on industrial action for a month, are pressing ahead with picketing, vowing not to return to class until government accedes to their demand for an upward review of their paltry earnings.UZ administrators responded heavy-handedly, threatening to replace the striking lecturers, with reports indicating that the adjunct tutors would be earning US$3 per hour.The Association of University Teachers (AUT) spokesperson, Obvious Vengeyi, blasted UZ for failing to attract applications for the posts.It is true that the University of Zimbabwe has hired experts to replace the real experts, who are on a lawful and constitutional strike, demanding a restoration of their salary to pre-October 2018 rates, whereby a junior lecturer got US$2,250 per month before it was slashed to only US$230, which they are currently getting.The so-called experts are hired as adjunct lecturers. That means they are not replacing the real experts. It was the university administrations hope that they would get hundreds of them so that the university would return to normal business.Unfortunately, the experiment failed spectacularly. The whole university failed to attract more than 10 across all its 11 faculties. All 10 are not qualified to teach at high school. They were pulled from the streets and from churches. It is a joke, to say the least, said Vengeyi.Last week, UZ was further plunged into chaos after the Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) staged a flash demonstration, demanding the return of lecturers.The students criticised the UZ administration for pressing ahead with examinations when they had little lecture time. The striking lecturers have disassociated themselves from overseeing examinations.Vengeyi told NewZimbabwe.com that the situation at UZ is dire and might deteriorate if the institution and the parent government arm Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education  do not address their grievances.The university is paying only US$5.50 per hour. It is not even enough for transport and lunch. The AUT, therefore, did not see any reason to interfere with their process. The situation at UZ as of today is pathetic. There are no classes taking place until we receive US$2,250. That demand must be met.If that is not met, then there is no graduation this year. Block 4 should have started on Monday, 19 May, but it failed. Nothing is happening. Remember too that Block 3 failed. This means if the situation remains the same for the next week, this semester is off, said Vengeyi.\n\nThe lecturers, who have been on industrial action for a month, are pressing ahead with picketing, vowing not to return to class until government accedes to their demand for an upward review of their paltry earnings.\n\nUZ administrators responded heavy-handedly, threatening to replace the striking lecturers, with reports indicating that the adjunct tutors would be earning US$3 per hour.The Association of University Teachers (AUT) spokesperson, Obvious Vengeyi, blasted UZ for failing to attract applications for the posts.It is true that the University of Zimbabwe has hired experts to replace the real experts, who are on a lawful and constitutional strike, demanding a restoration of their salary to pre-October 2018 rates, whereby a junior lecturer got US$2,250 per month before it was slashed to only US$230, which they are currently getting.The so-called experts are hired as adjunct lecturers.

I am asking for an apology from them because somehow I think that they think that the law works for them or belongs to them. Even I can be protected by the law. If its a crime, a magistrate is going to determine that. The law is going to determine that, said a defiant Silent Killer.\n\nHe went on to warn that he is under the protection of Prophet Walter Magaya if they dare to poke him.\n\nI read that letter and I cant say sorry that I was the one who leaked. The letter was sent to my lawyers, this is between the lawyers. Remember Im the son of Prophet Magaya, so whatever you plan on me, rains will pour, said Silent Killer.\n\nIn the letter of demand, Y2K Entertainment alleges that they incurred substantial expenses, including cost of three airfare tickets and various payments made to facilitate his travel and Visa application.\n\nWe are instructed by our client to demand, as we hereby do; that you pay the sum of USD122, 170 (One hundred and twenty-two thousand one hundred and seventy United States Dollars) which amount is now due to our client and must be paid within seven (7) days of being served with this letter.\n\nYou are also further expected to pay US$12, 217 (Twelve thousand two hundred and seventeen United States dollars) being our collection commission, reads part of the letter.\n\n",

village in Mberengwa.Mpofu bought rat poison and laced the milk in her childs feeding bottle.Having no place to sleep she approached a Good Samaritan Florence Dhaka, who gave a place to sleep.Throughout the night, the baby cried persistently, and in the morning the Samaritan suggested taking the baby to the hospital, the court heard.The baby was pronounced dead upon arrival at Zvishavane General Hospital.The matter was initially reported as sudden death.Nurses who testified told court that Mpofu had told them that her baby was battling flu.After the death was reported at

            "content": "By Newzwire\n\nKARO Platinum has completed earthworks at its new mine in Ngezi and is in advanced talks to raise an additional $165 million to complete the project, which has faced significant delays due to low platinum prices.\n\nManaging Director Bernard Pryor says the company has so far spent $140 million on developing the mine, which will be Zimbabwes third-largest platinum producer upon completion.Earthworks are always challenging, but weve completed them to 100%, Pryor said during a call with analysts on Thursday.The project will have a 132 kV powerline, while the Chirundazi Dam has been built to supply water.Its a big project, but everything that we need is in close proximity, he added.Karo has opened a tender for a mining contract to begin stripping overburden and prepare for mining.This is a large contract; we need a highly competent mining contract to move an extensive amount of material, some 1.41.5 million BCM (bank cubic metres) per month, said Pryor.On funding, Tharisa Financial Director Andrew Henwood says: We are in advanced talks with a lending syndicate, South African and African banks. We are targeting $165 million of that funding.Karo has already raised $37 million through a bond on the Victoria Falls Stock Exchange and may extend the facility. It may also raise between $50 million and $100 million through a gold streaming agreement, where a buyer provides upfront capital for a share of gold produced as a by-product.As far as the timing is concerned, we are looking at first ore in mill starting 15 months after we close the fundraising, Henwood said.Sitting on the Great Dyke, Karo will include a 10-year open-pit phase and a 30-year underground mine, producing 226,000 ounces annuallybehind Zimplats (646,000 oz) and Unki (244,000 oz).Karo had hoped to complete the mine in 2024, but had to push back timelines due to the collapse in global platinum prices, which has stalled investment across the industry.Phoevos Pouroulis, CEO of Tharisa, said: While we have slowed development at the Karo Platinum Project in line with capital availability, we have nevertheless continued work on infrastructure, water dams and further optimisations including commencing with studies for the future underground mine development, while presenting the opportunity to non-traditional financiers, who like us, see the long-term benefits of the uniqueness not only of this Tier 1 project but of the applications PGMs will play for decades to come.The Zimbabwe government has a free 15% stake in the mine, and has an option to buy a further 11%.\n\nManaging Director Bernard Pryor says the company has so far spent $140 million on developing the mine, which will be Zimbabwes third-largest platinum producer upon completion.\n\nEarthworks are always challenging, but weve completed them to 100%, Pryor said during a call with analysts on Thursday.The project will have a 132 kV powerline, while the Chirundazi Dam has been built to supply water.Its a big project, but everything that we need is in close proximity, he added.Karo has opened a tender for a mining contract to begin stripping overburden and prepare for mining.This is a large contract; we need a highly competent mining contract to move an extensive amount of material, some 1.41.5 million BCM (bank cubic metres) per month, said Pryor.On funding, Tharisa Financial Director Andrew Henwood says: We are in advanced talks with a lending syndicate, South African and African banks.
