            "content": "By Andy Dolan l MailOnline\n\nA MANAGER at a healthcare company has won an unfair dismissal case after she was sacked two days after she complained that her bosss husband was sexually inappropriate with her.\n\nAmber Stoter felt ambushed when businesswoman Olinda Chapel-Nkomo called her into a meeting and fired her 48 hours after she lodged the complaint, an employment tribunal heard.\n\nMs Stoter, 30, had complained that the CEOs husband Tytan Nkomo made a crude comment to her about being hard and referred to her as his property.\n\nAfter Ms Stoter posted a picture with a caption saying working hard in the sun, Mr Nkomo commented saying thats not the only thing you make go hard.\n\nMr Nkomo also called Ms Stoter his girlfriend, it was heard.\n\nCompany director Mrs Chapel-Nkomo sacked Ms Stoter because she viewed the allegations as problematic, Reading Employment Tribunal concluded.\n\nMs Stoter is now set to win compensation after successfully suing Gain Healthcare for unfair dismissal.\n\nShe told MailOnline today that the tribunal experience had been stressful and she had struggled to find work since being sacked.\n\nOlinda Chapel-Nkomo announced managerial performance reviews  which led to Ms Stoter being sacked  a day after she was informed of inappropriate texts sent by her husband, the tribunal heard.\n\nThe tribunal heard Ms Stoter started working as a manager for the health firm, in Bicester, Oxfordshire, on June 5, 2023.\n\nOn June 26, she had a discussion with her line manager Jessica Cannon and raised concerns about the conduct of Mr Nkomo.\n\nAt the time, he was married to the founder and CEO Mrs Chapel-Nkomo.\n\nThe tribunal said he occupied a management position, but noted that this was disputed by Gain Healthcare, who said he was not an employee.\n\nMs Stoter told her line manager that Mr Nkomo had been sexually inappropriate with her and had told her she was like his girlfriend.\n\nThe manager said on one occasion, while they were in a car together, he told her dont allow men to look at you like that, you are part of my property after she half-smiled at a man.\n\nAnd, on another date, he responded to a picture of her with a caption reading working hard in the sun, with the comment thats not the only thing you make go hard.\n\nThe tribunal heard that during the conversation with Mrs Cannon, Ms Stoter was asked to show the messages she had been sent by Mr Nkomo but said she was unable to do so as their chat had disappearing messages.\n\nFollowing their conversation, Mrs Cannon decided that Mr Nkomo should stop working from the office.\n\nThe matter was not escalated any further after this.\n\nThe morning after their chat, against the wishes of Ms Stoter, the line manager also spoke to Mrs Chapel-Nkomo and stated that her husband had apparently sent inappropriate texts to (Ms Stoter).\n\nThe next day, Mrs Chapel-Nkomo told all managers via a WhatsApp group that she was going to hold performance review meetings.\n\nShe met with Ms Stoter on June 28 and the employee was dismissed following a heated conversation in which Ms Stoter became distressed, the panel heard.\n\nIt was heard she felt ambushed in the meeting and told Mrs Chapel-Nkomo that she had done this because of what your husband did.\n\nIn her dismissal letter, Gain Healthcare set out several reasons for Ms Stoters dismissal, which included how she had allegedly been witnessed leaving our premises to frequent the neighbouring tanning studio during contractual working hours.\n\nThey also said she was fired for sending an excessive number of messages to colleagues on a WhatsApp chat, among others.\n\nIn her witness statement, Mrs Chapel-Nkomo said: I dismissed her because of her exceptionally concerning and escalatory behaviour during my one to one with her.\n\nThe tribunal said that the matters raised by Ms Stoter in the meeting involved a specific report of sexual misconduct, directed at a junior female employee by a male with senior status at work.\n\nThey said the business deals with vulnerable clients and has significant safeguarding responsibilities.\n\nUpholding her claims of unfair dismissal on ground of protected disclosures, Employment Judge Colin Baran said: Overall, the Tribunal concludes that the principal reason for (Ms Stoters) dismissal by Mrs Chapel-Nkomo was the making of the protected disclosure about Mr Nkomo.\n\nThe Tribunal concludes that at the time of dismissal Mrs Chapel-Nkomo knew of the fact and nature of the disclosure  reports of sexually inappropriate conduct by her husband Mr Nkomo towards (Ms Stoter), a new member of staff.\n\nSuch a disclosure, if properly acted upon, would have been problematic not just for (Gain Healthcare) but also for Mr Nkomo personally.\n\nThe judgement added that the reason given for dismissal was not supported by other evidence, and that the matters reported in the disclosure were not looked into or addressed by the company following Ms Stoters dismissal.\n\nThe judge said Mrs Chapel-Nkomo sacked Ms Stoter as a response to the disclosure she made about her husband.\n\nMs Stoter also won a claim of victimisation.\n\nA remedy hearing to decide her compensation will take place in September.\n\nMs Stoter told MailOnline: I represented myself at the hearing and it was difficult, but I had to stand up for myself. Maintaining ones integrity is the best way.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nPARLIAMENT has heard that most prisoners are malnourished while a considerable number is suffering from pneumonia as a result of sleeping on cold floors without adequate blankets and warm clothing.\n\nMashonaland East Proportional Representation Member of Parliament Lilian Zemura told Speaker Jacob Mudenda last Wednesday that all prisons lack adequate bedding and a proper diet.\n\nThe situation has been exacerbated by the fact that most prisons countrywide are overcrowded. Inmates survive on a single meal daily.\n\nDuring a Question-and-Answer session, Zemura queried government policy on the issue.\n\nIs it government policy for people who are in jails to sleep without warm clothes and blankets, without eating, especially during this winter period?\n\nI am asking because it seems as if it is now a pattern (norm) people do not have jerseys, blankets and others\n\nZemura was interrupted by the Speaker for using an unacceptable language or word (slang)- pattern.\n\nI meant to say, has it become a norm now in Zimbabwe that those who are in jails, whether sentenced or not, suffer from pneumonia as a result of catching a cold? They sleep on dry, cold floors without blankets and mattresses, said Zemura without naming the jail (s).\n\nActing Leader of Government Business in Parliament Anxious Masuka responded that government provided those in prisons with basics but due to the economic challenges, the MP should be specific so that the government can deal with the issues she raised.\n\nGovernment, in its plans, takes those who have been incarcerated for rehabilitation so that they can be reintegrated into society. During the process, the government provides for the basics like food, shelter and clothing.\n\nHowever, when there are challenges, I request that if there is a specific jail, then that communication should be brought forward so that we will be able to address it properly, Masuka said.\n\nThe Speaker urged the MP to name those prisons without blankets and food.\n\nThe question should address the jails that do not have blankets, Mudenda said.\n\nBefore he could finish his statement, Zemura shouted all jails.\n\nMudenda posed a question to the MP before advising her to put her question in writing and to be specific.\n\nDid you go to all the jails, Hon. Member? Please put it in writing and be specific as to which jails where there are no blankets, said Mudenda.\n\nMost prisons that were visited by a Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs had no blankets and food for inmates.\n\nPrisoners complained over a poor diet, surviving on boiled cabbage and sadza once or twice a day.\n\nAt Chikurubi Maximum Prison, besides being overpopulated, inmates revealed that they had no blankets and most were using blankets supplied by their families or the churches and well-wishers. The majority of prisoners was wearing tattered prison garb.\n\n",
