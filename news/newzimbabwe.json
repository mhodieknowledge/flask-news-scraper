According to a study by SNV Zimbabwe, 72% of menstruating schoolgirls do not use sanitary products simply because they cannot afford them.\n\nThe study also showed that 62% of schoolgirls in Zimbabwe miss school every month due to lack of sanitary pads and 70% of these girls are not even aware of any sanitary pads brand on the market.\n\nIn a gesture to commemorate the 2025 Menstrual Hygiene Day last Friday, Ecobank handed over a consignment of 450 menstrual hygiene kits for onward distribution to deserving school girls in Tsholothso District.\n\nThe kits include two packs of reusable sanitary pads totalling eight that will last for two to three years, two pairs of underwear, washing and bathing soap, toothbrush and toothpaste, a five litre bucket for soaking and a bath towel.\n\nSpeaking at the handover ceremony, Ecobanks Regional Head Consumer Banking, Patricia Mungwadzi-Musemesi committed to give a hand in alleviating period poverty.\n\nThis donation comes at a critical time. Across Zimbabwe, almost 60% of girls in rural schools miss school every month due to lack of access to menstrual hygiene products. That is not just a statisticit is a crisis. And it is one we must confront together.\n\nShe said the commitment to girls and women is not new to Ecobank as she chronicled the assistance extended to women and girls in Buhera and Lupane where projects inclined towards promoting financial inclusion for rural women, helping them access savings, credit, and training to build stronger futures have been rolled out.\n\nAt Ecobank, we are proud signatories of the UN Womens Empowerment Principles, and through our Ellevate programme, we have supported over 73,000 women-led businesses across Africa, providing over US$177 million in funding. We believe that when women and girls thrive, communities prosper.\n\nThis is what A Better Way means to usnot just better banking, but better lives. It means standing with girls in Tsholotsho, in Buhera, in Lupane, and across Zimbabwe. It means ensuring that no girl is left behind because of her period, Mungwadzi-Musemesi said.\n\nCare Zimbabwe Country Director, Walter Mwasaa said the humanitarian organisation places the welfare of women at the heart of its operations.\n\nAt Care Zimbabwe, we believe that no girl should ever have to choose between her education and her period. Yet, for millions of girls across our country, that is the painful reality. Period poverty is not just a health issueit is a barrier to opportunity, to equality, and to hope.\n\nThat is why we are proud to be taking this donation to Thsolotsho launching the Period Power Initiative in partnership with Ecobank, he said.\n\nThe Primary and Secondary Education Ministrys chief director for Learner Welfare ,Psychological Services and Special Needs Education, Hannah Maisiri hailed the donation saying the event was more than a celebrationit is a reaffirmation of our shared commitment to ensuring that no girl is left behind because of her period.\n\nWhen girls miss school every month due to lack of access to sanitary products, their education, confidence, and future are all put at risk. That is why the Government of Zimbabwe, through the Ministry of Education, has made it a priority to support menstrual hygiene management in schools, she said.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/thousands-could-unknowingly-have-alcohol-brain-damage/",
            "content": "By BBC\n\nTHOUSANDS of people with alcohol-related brain damage (ARBD) could be going undiagnosed, an expert says.\n\nResearch suggests consuming 35 units of alcohol per week for five years or more can cause ARBD, which affects a persons ability to carry out basic daily tasks.Lee Caldwell, 56, who was diagnosed with ARBD last year, said he struggled with short-term memory and impulse control.Prof Gareth Roderique Davies said stigma and lack of awareness led to ARBD being missed or misdiagnosed, and said adequate resources remained a challenge.The Welsh government said it was investing 67m to help people affected by drugs and alcohol, including ARBD.If left undiagnosed, patients with ARBD can end up requiring long term nursing care, but with the right intervention they can improve and live independently.Mr Caldwell was admitted to Brynawel House, a residential rehabilitation facility in south Wales, where he was diagnosed with ARBD last September.He said at the peak of his drinking he found it easier to cross the road to the garage to buy alcohol than to confront the feelings of guilt and shame associated with his habit.The addiction became more important than living, said Mr Caldwell, a former Royal Navy engineer and construction manager.Explaining the daily challenges ARBD could present, he said: One day [in rehab] I couldnt find my room.I could see room seven, theres eight  wheres nine?This lad I got on with said: It would help if you were in the right building  you live over there.Mr Caldwell said his longer term memory was unaffected but he struggled with silly things like whether he had taken his medication, as well as impulse control.How many units are in alcoholic drinks?Pint of lower strength lager, beer or cider  2 unitsPint of higher strength lager, beer or cider  3 unitsSmall glass of wine (125ml)  1.5 unitsLarge glass of wine (250ml)  3 unitsSingle shot of spirits (25ml)  1 unitSource: NHSMr Caldwell said since undergoing six months of rehabilitation: I dont wake up with cravings now and I am getting physically more and more fit.But I still worry about going out somewhere Im not familiar with, he added.With ARBD, as youre recovering, your memory comes back, which doesnt happen to many people really.Mr Caldwell had mixed feelings about leaving and returning to his home area of north Wales.I knew I could do it  but I know Im an addict, so I was always waiting for that demon.Asked if he could see how far he had come, he said: No. But I can see how far Im going to go.Sue has shoulder length reddish brown hair and is wearing a V-neck green, linen top and silver necklace. She is stood in the grounds of Brynawel House on a sunny day, with the polytunnel in the background where horticultural therapy takes place.Sue Gwyn says alcohol-related brain damage has become more of an issue since the pandemicPost-pandemic we are seeing people with far more extensive brain problems because of their drinking, said Sue Gwyn, chief executive of Brynawel House.The charity provides rehabilitation for substance misuse, but specialises in ARBD.She said patients were typically referred by local authorities and their cognitive function was then assessed.Even as low as 35 units of alcohol a week for maybe four or five years can impact on your brain, said Ms Gwyn.Sometimes [patients] will have been working with community services for 18 months but ARBD hasnt been picked up.And thats a worry because we know that up to 75% of people with ARBD, if they have rehab, they can make a very meaningful recovery.If its not picked up the outcomes will be poorer for them, and in the most severe cases theyre going to end up in long term nursing care.When you think that 36 units is around four bottles of wine, there are an awful lot of people who will be routinely drinking that as a minimum every week and thinking thats OK because they havent got obvious liver problems.But we are as worried about peoples brains as we are about anything else.We see a massive change in people by the time they leave, said occupational therapist at Brynawel House, Jan Bevan.Life evolved around alcohol and when they could get their next drink. But theyre actually looking at a future and whats meaningful, because theyd forgotten what meaningful is.She said part of her work was to help patients to build routines, with prompts to aid memory.My job is to ensure that when they go from here they have strategies and support to enable them to carry on.As a charity and the only not-for-profit providing ARBD rehabilitation in Wales, Ms Gwyn said funding arrangements were not clear cut.While area planning boards have ringfenced funding for addiction support, she said few would fund ARBD rehabilitation.Support at Brynawel House, which includes a multi-disciplinary team and costs 1,760 a week, is provided for a minimum of six months.If you look at the long-term impact of somebody having to go into residential care for maybe 10 or 20 years, then six months or a year spent in rehab here, I think it is money well invested, she said.Jan is smiling at the camera as she stands in the large lawned grounds of Brynawel House on a sunny day. She is wearing prescription sunglasses and a floral top and pink cardigan.Jan Bevan says ARBD can affect a persons gait, movement and cause them to physically shakeProf Gareth Roderique Davies is co-lead of the addictions research group at the University of South Wales, where work is being done to better understand ARBD and its prevalence.He said as co-author of the Welsh governments substance misuse treatment framework, published four years ago, he was frustrated with the lack of progress creating clinical pathways into treatment.In many ways Wales is leading the way in terms of recognising ARBD as an issue, but there is the road block of putting the appropriate resources in place in order to deal with it, he said.We did some research a few years ago which suggested a prevalence of about 34 per 100,000 in south Wales, which is almost certainly a huge underestimation.So just scaling up those figures, youre talking about thousands of people in Wales with a potential diagnosis.Gareth is smiling at the camera. He is stood with the large lawns of Brynawel House in the background.

He is wearing dark rimmed glasses, a navy blazer and a patterned, pale blue shirt.Prof Gareth Roderique Davies says there are likely to be thousands of people in Wales with a potential ARBD diagnosisProf Davies said stigma played a big role in people being correctly diagnosed.Individuals who are drinking excessively may present as confused and chaotic and possibly even aggressive and that immediately means theyre treated in a stigmatised way, he said.Whereas in fact theyre exhibiting signs of alcohol related brain damage. But the pathways to recovery are really, really ill defined.There is some evidence suggesting some individuals with ARBD are being misdiagnosed with early onset dementia. But memory clinics are not necessarily the right place for them because thats dealing with a degenerative disorder  whereas if interventions take place at the right time, ARBD doesnt have to get any worse.In many circumstances it can improve with correct intervention.The Welsh government said it was investing more than 67m to help people affected by drugs and alcohol, including people with alcohol related brain damage, to ensure a range of services and support is in place.A spokesperson added: Clinical pathways are a matter for each area planning board area to determine and it is important they work closely with all appropriate organisations to ensure early identification of ARBD.\n\nSometimes [patients] will have been working with community services for 18 months but ARBD hasnt been picked up.\n\nAnd thats a worry because we know that up to 75% of people with ARBD, if they have rehab, they can make a very meaningful recovery.If its not picked up the outcomes will be poorer for them, and in the most severe cases theyre going to end up in long term nursing care.When you think that 36 units is around four bottles of wine, there are an awful lot of people who will be routinely drinking that as a minimum every week and thinking thats OK because they havent got obvious liver problems.But we are as worried about peoples brains as we are about anything else.We see a massive change in people by the time they leave, said occupational therapist at Brynawel House, Jan Bevan.Life evolved around alcohol and when they could get their next drink. But theyre actually looking at a future and whats meaningful, because theyd forgotten what meaningful is.She said part of her work was to help patients to build routines, with prompts to aid memory.My job is to ensure that when they go from here they have strategies and support to enable them to carry on.As a charity and the only not-for-profit providing ARBD rehabilitation in Wales, Ms Gwyn said funding arrangements were not clear cut.While area planning boards have ringfenced funding for addiction support, she said few would fund ARBD rehabilitation.Support at Brynawel House, which includes a multi-disciplinary team and costs 1,760 a week, is provided for a minimum of six months.If you look at the long-term impact of somebody having to go into residential care for maybe 10 or 20 years, then six months or a year spent in rehab here, I think it is money well invested, she said.Jan is smiling at the camera as she stands in the large lawned grounds of Brynawel House on a sunny day.
