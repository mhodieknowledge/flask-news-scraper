The neck and left hand were cut, while the victims private parts were missing.\n\nAccording to police, the suspect was allegedly spotted assaulting the victim for letting cattle stray onto his field.\n\nCircumstances are that on June 8, 2025, the deceased was harvesting grains with his grandfather, Isaac Shumba (70) when he was ordered to take over herding cattle from his sister, aged 10, at around 1500 hours.\n\nAt around 1600hrs, elder Shumba sent his daughter, Vongai Shumba (29), to look for Munyaradzi so that he could bring cattle to pull a cart laden with harvested grains.\n\nVongai failed to locate Munyaradzi, prompting her and her father to collect the grain up to around 1700 hours, but Munyaradzi was still nowhere to be found, leading to a search.\n\nA neighbour, Tariro Kwangwari, later told the family that she had witnessed the accused person assaulting the boy before sunset for letting cattle graze on his field.\n\nSearches were conducted by family members and other villagers around the area where the suspect had been seen assaulting the deceased, but they found only his rafters and a pool of blood, said Kohwera.\n\nA further search the next morning unearthed the grisly find of the mutilated body tucked in the grass about 15 metres from the point where the juvenile was allegedly assaulted.\n\nGwenhere was immediately arrested and is helping police with investigations.\n\nInvestigations are underway to establish the cause of the death in a case suspected to be ritual murder. The general public is urged to respect the sanctity of life, said the police spokesman.\n\n",

Its the countrys sixth attempt since 2009 to replace the dollar as the southern African nations main transacting currency, but is yet to succeed.\n\nSeveral measures will need to be adopted to boost ZiG usage, including deepening the foreign-exchange market to ensure full price discovery, said Wojciech Maliszewski, the Washington-based lenders mission chief, who is in Zimbabwe to review its request for a new SMP. The nations last program ended abruptly in 2019 after the central bank printed money that fueled the collapse of the local currency.\n\nRight now we see good stability in the official market and we also see a convergence between the parallel and official rate, he told reporters Monday after meeting Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa in the capital, Harare. Ideally, we would like to see an elimination of this gap, we would like to see one exchange rate.\n\nStill, the ZiGs 43% devaluation in September to narrow the gap between the official and unofficial rate and its inconvertibility has led citizens to favor dollars.\n\nThe ZiG traded little changed on Tuesday at 26.96 against the dollar and exchanged hands at 32 to 35 on the parallel market.\n\nThe Washington-based lender said it isnt pushing for more exchange rate depreciation but for the two rates to converge supported by government fiscal discipline.\n\nThere is a good chance that these rates will converge, Maliszewski said.\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncube last month at the annual meetings of the African Development Bank said he expected the SMP to be finalized by the end of June. The program would bring Zimbabwe closer toward revamping its $21 billion debt pile with creditors that want assurances that its authorities are pursuing prudent fiscal and monetary policies.\n\n",

Its a way of arm-twisting certain members of our community to resume teaching.\n\nMany here who have not been paid have resolved that, whether they receive the US$230 or not, they will not return. The majority of us have not been paid  yes. But we remain committed. Until junior lecturers get US$2,250, we will not go back to class, said Vengeyi.\n\nThe universitys latest move follows its hiring of adjunct lecturers last month to fill gaps left by the striking staff.\n\nHowever, the AUT has dismissed this as futile, claiming most replacements lack the qualifications to teach at a university level.\n\nThere is no teaching happening at the university. No supervision is taking place. A few scabs have been hired to replace sort of  the lecturers on strike, said Vengeyi further.\n\nThe prolonged strike has disrupted examinations, with planned sittings facing further delays, potentially derailing the academic year.\n\nLast month, six students were arrested after staging flash protests demanding the lecturers return, signalling the growing unrest on campus.\n\n",
