            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA dramatic power struggle has unfolded within the MDC-T party as Vice President Elias Mudzuri, allegedly in collaboration with Morgen Komichi, launched a bid to oust the partys embattled leader, Douglas Mwonzora, and seize control of Harvest House  the party headquarters in Harare CBD.\n\nThe move comes on the heels of a High Court ruling in late February 2025, in which Justice Hapias Zhou ordered Mwonzora to resign and facilitate a fresh congress within six months.\n\nThe ruling cited irregularities in the 2022 MDC-T Extraordinary Congress that saw Mwonzora elevated to the party leadership.\n\nMudzuri is arguing that, in light of Justice Zhous ruling, he is now the rightful leader of the party, by virtue of his position as Vice President.\n\nMudzuri arrived at Harvest House this morning with a considerable entourage, but was met with fierce resistance from Mwonzoras militant youth supporters, who aggressively blocked his entry.\n\nPolice intervention was ultimately required to prevent the situation from escalating further.\n\nMudzuri was seen leavingin his black Toyota Land Cruiser amidst the commotion.\n\nEarlier, Mudzuri had reportedly ordered Mwonzoras supporters and loyalists to vacate the building, prompting a heated confrontation.\n\nThis resulted in the arrival of truckloads of police officers in riot gear.\n\nMudzuri then briefly disappeared before resurfacing, claiming he had visited Harare Central Police Station to request a police escort to facilitate his occupation of Harvest House.\n\nMwonzora is no longer the President, as per the High Court ruling in February 2025. There is a void in the party presidency that must be filled, claimed one of Mudzuris security personnel, who requested anonymity.\n\nHowever, Albert Chidhakwa, the MDC National Youth Chairman and leader of Mwonzoras militant youth faction at Harvest House, insisted that Mudzuris actions are premature and invalid, as the party has lodged an appeal against Justice Zhous ruling.\n\nThe party has appealed Justice Zhous ruling. Mudzuri cannot rely on the High Court ruling because the appeal has rendered it ineffective. President Mwonzora remains the party leader. There is no change to that, he stated.\n\nThe battle for control of Harvest House has been a long-standing source of conflict within the opposition. It intensified following the Supreme Courts decision in March 2020 to nullify Nelson Chamisas ascendancy to the party presidency after the death of founding leader, Morgan Tsvangirai in 2018.\n\nWhile Mwonzora, in his then role as Secretary General, assumed leadership, he has struggled to maintain stability within the party. Many members defected to Chamisa and later to his Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), which was officially formed in 2022.\n\nMwonzoras party chose not to participate in the 2023 elections, citing concerns over irregularities in the delimitation exercise.\n\n",
