            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFormer Finance Minister Tendai Biti has condemned the removal of Energy Mutodi from his position as Chair of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Budget and Finance, following the Bikita South legislators demand that Parliament summon Finance Ministry Permanent Secretary George Guvamatanga to answer bribery allegations involving millions of dollars.\n\nMutodi had taken to X to allege that Guvamatanga was demanding kickbacks from contractors undertaking government work across various sectors. He further claimed that contractors had lost interest in working with the government because Guvamatanga was allegedly demanding millions of dollars as bribes at every turn, threatening to withhold their payments if his demands were not met.\n\nHis allegations sparked debate on social media, with some Zanu PF colleagues criticising him for rocking the boat and causing divisions within the party. Consequently, he was removed from his post as Chair of the Budget and Finance Parliamentary Committee and replaced by Chipinge East MP Lincoln Dhliwayo  a move Biti has branded as unconstitutional.\n\nWananchi, The abrupt removal of Honourable @energymutodi as chair of parliament Budget & Finance Committee is an abject unconstitutional overreach by a desperate canterkarous cartel that has captured the State and will do everything legally & extra-legally to perpetuate its vice-like grip on the public coffers of this country, Biti wrote on his X account on Monday.\n\nBiti emphasised that Parliamentarians have a constitutional duty to hold the executive to account and must be allowed to do so without facing punishment.\n\nMembers of Parliament have a constitutional obligation to hold the Executive & every other institution to account in terms of section 119 of the Constitution.\n\nFurther Members of Parliament have absolute privilege, and an unfettered right to feeedom of expression when they stand and debate in the chambers of the August House. Honorable Mutodi enjoys this constitutional protection.\n\nHe has an obligation to raise a matter of great national interest, Biti said.\n\nHe further argued that Mutodi should not be made a scapegoat for speaking out on matters that were already in the public domain, noting that Guvamatangas alleged corrupt conduct was documented in the 2024 Auditor Generals Report.\n\nThe issue of George Tongesai Guvamatanga and the alleged bribes he is demanding is a matter in the public domain and requires parliamentary scrutiny.\n\nThe issue of direct payments being made directly by Treasury to suppliers oblivious of line Ministries, Departments and Agencies has been captured in the Auditor Generals Reports.\n\nBiti also alleged that Guvamatanga had facilitated over US$2 billion in payments to service providers in contravention of the Public Finance Management Act.\n\nIn 2024 alone US$2 billion of payments were made directly by Mr Guvamatanga in his role and capacity as the Paymaster General.\n\nYet Treasury Instructions, which he supervises, the Public Finance Management Act and the Constitution clearly proscribe the same, he said.\n\nBiti suggested that Mutodi should not have retracted his statement against Guvamatanga.\n\nIn other words, Hon Mutodi did not disclose anything new. Everything he uttered in parliament was a matter of direct and implicit public knowledge. His mistake was his purported retraction and apology. Understandably, as a loyal member of Zanu PF, it would be expecting too much from the same. A mosquito cannot cure malaria, Biti said.\n\nBe that as it may, Honourable Mutodis removal is a direct attack on the constitution, which gives autonomy to the institution of Parliament. It is a direct attack on Parliament itself.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA retired pastor who tried to evade repaying a US$22,750 loan by falsely claiming illiteracy has lost his case at the High Court, which ordered him to settle the debt and declared his Budiriro house executable.\n\nJudges of appeal Justices Hapias Zhou and Benjamin Chikowero ruled that Pastor Stefan Pios Mumbiro knowingly signed all loan and mortgage documents binding him to businessman Collins Farai Muchada, but later attempted to take advantage of his supposed illiteracy to escape liability.\n\nThe first respondent was not illiterate. He was educated up to Grade 7, could read and write, and even successfully undertook pastoral studies, the judges said. He cannot evade responsibility by pretending not to understand what he signed.\n\nThe court condemned Mumbiros conduct, saying he had taken advantage of Muchadas trust while later seeking to hide behind claims of being duped.\n\nEvidence before the court showed that Mumbiro willingly signed an Acknowledgement of Debt, a Power of Attorney to register a Mortgage Bond, and other loan documents, all of which were verified by a handwriting expert.\n\nThe only credible evidence on record was that adduced by the appellant himself, amply corroborated by the Questioned Document Examiner, the Acknowledgement of Debt, the Power of Attorney to Pass Mortgage Bond, the Mortgage Bond, and the Forensic Examination Report, Chikowero said.\n\nThe court said Mumbiros story fell apart under cross-examination when he admitted signing blank papers, a move the judges described as a deliberate attempt to distort facts and mislead the court.\n\nCiting the long-standing legal principle of caveat subscriptor, the bench reminded litigants that a party to a contract is bound by his signature, whether or not he has read or understood the document.\n\nChikowero criticised the lower court for allowing Mumbiro to eat his cake and still have it by accepting contradictory statements about how much he borrowed.\n\nAs a result, the High Court ordered Mumbiro to repay US$22,750 plus interest and costs, and ruled that his Budiriro home, Stand 2308 of Willowvale Estate, be declared specially executable should he fail to pay.\n\nIn their judgment, the judges issued a clear warning to others attempting similar deceit.\n\nThe loud and clear message to go out from the court is: businessmen beware. If you fail to honour your contracts, dont start crying when the other party obtains an order compelling you to perform.\n\nMumbiro had earlier accused Muchada of being a fraudster who wants to con me of my house, but the judges found no proof of that claim.\n\nThe case originated at the Harare Magistrates Court, where Mumbiro initially won after convincing the magistrate that he was illiterate and had been duped. However, the High Court overturned that decision, ruling that Mumbiro had instead abused the courts sympathy and his position as a retired pastor to avoid his legal obligations.\n\n",

The ends of justice demand that whenever possible, justice be dispensed on the merits rather than on technicalities, Bhunu said.\n\nIn 2018, when Monochrome accused Kehrai and Labenmon of illegally mining alluvial chrome on six of its claims in the Guruve North Dyke Msasa 122 to 127 and sued for damages, representing lost profits.\n\nMonochrome argued that surveys by the Ministry of Mines confirmed encroachment, supported by a geological expert who presented diagrams, pictures, and stockpile estimates of the extracted chrome.\n\nThe defendants denied wrongdoing. Kehrai failed to appear, resulting in a default judgment against it, while Labenmon insisted it mined lawfully under a contract with Kehrai, challenging Monochromes ownership and the scale of damages claimed.\n\nIn 2023, the High Court sided with Labenmon, ruling Monochrome had not proved ownership, the extent of extraction, or the US$8 million loss.\n\nBut Bhunu found that the appeal raises weighty issues, especially after Kehrai capitulated by failing to defend ownership of the disputed claims.\n\nThe applicant has sound and reasonable prospects of success on appeal given that the first respondents ownership of the mining claims has been severely dented by the extant default judgment against it, Bhunu ruled.\n\nThe second respondent is merely riding on the back of the first respondent as the source of its mining rights. That being the case, it is likely to fall with the capitulation of its principal.\n\nThe Supreme Court ordered Monochrome to file its appeal within 10 days, paving the way for a full hearing on the merits of the chrome feud.\n\n",
