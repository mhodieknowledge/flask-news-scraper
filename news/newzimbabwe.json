            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nHARARE waste collection crisis will soon be over as Geo Pomona Waste Sorting Plant, vehicles and equipment were commissioned by President Emmerson Mnangagwa in Harare this Thursday.\n\nAddressing government officials, investors and Zanu PF supporters at the Geo Pomona waste management dump site in Borrowdale, President Mnangagwa warned Zimbabweans to desist from illegal dumping.\n\nAs we roll out the modern waste collection system, I urge all of us Zimbabweans to desist from illegal dumping.\n\nLet us embrace a culture of responsible waste disposal, recycling, and environmental stewardship in order to realise our goal of a clean, safe, and healthy environment, President Mnangagwa said.\n\nHe said the waste collection crisis, particularly in the capital city of Harare has had dire consequences ranging from environmental degradation to public health risks, among other negative impacts.\n\nWe have seen outbreaks of diseases, a situation that is wholly unacceptable. Such conditions must become a thing of the past. The plant and the trucks we are commissioning today mark a turning point in our quest towards efficiency in wasteanagement.\n\nTherefore, in line with Vision 2030, my government will continue to prioritize the creation of clean, safe and modern urban environments, which are engines of economic growth. I am, therefore, pleased with the acquisition and deployment of 45 refuse trucks and 100 skip bins by Geo Pomona, with more on the way to come.\n\nCongratulations, Pomona. Through the pages of this equipment, we must see the waste management system being capacitated to efficiently and consistently collect waste across all parts of Harare, Mnangagwa said.\n\nHe also urged all the players in all towns and cities to take a leaf from such initiatives towards improving waste management in the country.\n\nReferring to the Geo Pomona waste sorting plant, the President described it as a beacon of nations potential.\n\nThe facility is a beacon of our national potential. It represents how infrastructure, when aligned to a national vision, can transform lives, protect the environment, and drive economic growth. It is important to note that waste is not just waste.\n\nWaste is actually a resource. With this modern sorting facility, recyclable materials can be recovered, repurposed, and reintegrated into the economy, he said.\n\nMnangagwa added that waste sorting plant is a critical enabler of the Waste to Energy Project, which will soon contribute between 16 and 22 megawatts of electricity to the national grid.\n\nThis is a solution that exemplifies innovation and modernisation.\n\nHe acknowledged the management and the staff of Geo- Pomona waste management led by its CEO Delish Nguwaya for their clarity of role, not only towards a greener planet but also advancing the realisation of national development goals.\n\nYour accomplishments thus far are applauded and inspirational to others in our region and continent. However, the responsibility of waste management does not lie with Geo Pomona alone. It is the duty of every Zimbabwean.\n\nThe event coincided with the World Environment Day celebrations Thursday as Zimbabweans joined the rest of the world in celebrating their shared mission of protecting the environment for the present and future generations.\n\nThe Geo Pomona Waste Management, (Private) Limited is a product of Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) venture involving the Harare City Council.\n\n",

            "content": "SUNDAY MORNING TABLET\n\nWHY should we seek the word of the cross?\n\nIn todays world, filled with challenges and uncertainties, the call to seek the face of Christ has never been more urgent.Life can feel overwhelming, and the influence of evil spirits and the devil seems to loom larger as we stray from our spiritual foundations.Yet, in the midst of this turmoil, we are reminded of the powerful promise found in Jeremiah 29:13: You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart. This verse encapsulates the essence of pursuing a relationship with Jesus Christ, the ultimate source of hope and strength.The story of Zacchaeus in Luke 19:1-10 serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of our efforts to seek Christ. Zacchaeus, a tax collector, was determined to see Jesus, even climbing a sycamore tree to catch a glimpse of Him.Interestingly, despite his efforts, it was not Zacchaeus who found Jesus first; rather, Jesus saw him. This teaches us that even our smallest attempts to seek Christ matter.When Jesus called out to Zacchaeus, saying, Hurry and come down! For I must stay at your house today, He demonstrated that He is always ready to respond to our desires for connection. Jesus sees us before we see Him, and He invites us into a relationship that transforms our lives.Jesus invites us to try me and see if I dont find favour in you. This call to test His goodness is echoed in Malachi 3:10, where we are encouraged to bring our whole selves to Him.When we seek the face of Christ, we open ourselves to the possibility of His grace and favour, enabling us to confront our challenges with renewed strength.As we invite Christ into our lives, He establishes a permanent relationship with us. This relationship empowers us to conquer our difficulties and stand firm against the adversities we face.When we put our minds and faith in Christ, we are reminded that we are not alone. He walks with us, guiding and supporting us through every trial.The call to seek the word of the cross is a call to embrace a relationship with Jesus Christ. Like Zacchaeus, let us not be discouraged by our limitations but instead be encouraged by the knowledge that every effort we make to seek Him is met with His love and grace.As we draw closer to Him, we prepare ourselves to be called children of God when He returns. Let us seek the face of Christ, for in doing so, we find our true strength and purpose.PRAYERHeavenly Father,We come before You with humble hearts, seeking Your presence and the transformative power of the cross.Thank You for the gift of Your Son, Jesus Christ, who invites us to draw near to Him. We acknowledge that in the midst of our challenges, it is easy to lose sight of You, but we desire to seek Your face with all our hearts.Lord, just as Zacchaeus climbed the sycamore tree in his pursuit of You, grant us the courage to climb beyond our fears and doubts. Help us to reach for You, knowing that even our smallest efforts are seen by You. We trust that You are always looking out for us and that Your love is eager to embrace us.As we navigate the trials of life, may we find strength in Your Word and comfort in Your promises. Teach us to rely on You, and let our faith be unwavering. Help us to recognize the influence of darkness around us and empower us to stand firm in Your light.Lord, we ask that You come into our homes and hearts, establishing a deep and lasting relationship with us. May our lives reflect Your love and grace, and may we be filled with the hope of being called Your children when You return.Remove all the tribulations and pains we find ourselves in today. Restore peace and make us rejoin all our families in love and harmony once again.In Jesus name, we pray.AMEN.\n\nIn todays world, filled with challenges and uncertainties, the call to seek the face of Christ has never been more urgent.\n\nLife can feel overwhelming, and the influence of evil spirits and the devil seems to loom larger as we stray from our spiritual foundations.Yet, in the midst of this turmoil, we are reminded of the powerful promise found in Jeremiah 29:13: You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.

            "content": "By BBC News\n\nA FORMER girlfriend of Sean Diddy Combs, testifying for a second day at his criminal trial under the pseudonym Jane, described how she felt pressured to engage in sexual encounters with male escorts while he watched, despite her expressing they upset her.\n\nShe also alleged a network of employees helped procure drugs for the lengthy encounters, known as hotel nights or freak-offs, that left her in pain and with frequent infections.Prosecutors have charged Mr Combs, 55, with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution.He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.At the beginning of the trial, now in its fifth week, defence attorney Teny Geragos said the government had overstepped with its charges and are trying to portray consensual sex between adults as evidence of crimes.With Janes testimony, prosecutors are seeking to provide evidence that the music moguls activities were criminal.In one hotel night encounter in New York in 2023, Jane testified that she invited a male sex worker to fly from Atlanta, Georgia, to New York City to join her and Mr Combs for an encounter at the Trump International Hotel.Jane paid for his ticket, she testified, and afterward, she worked to ensure that an envelope containing several thousand dollars was left for the escort at the front desk.On another occasion, the woman testified that Mr Combss chief of staff Kristina Khorram allegedly instructed her to pick up drugs from Los Angeles to bring to Mr Combs Miami mansion.Ms Khorram has been named by prosecutors in court as a co-conspirator to Mr Combs, and could potentially testify.Sean Diddy Combs: Who is the US rapper accused of sex trafficking?Jane told the court that she picked the package up from a member of Mr Combs security, put it in her check-in luggage and flew to Miami, where she discovered it contained ecstasy.She also said she often saw Mr Combs call his assistants and security to bring drugs to the hotels where they had their encounters with escorts.One of the charges Mr Combs faces is racketeering. In order to prove that, prosecutors have to show that he was running a criminal enterprise and conspiring to commit crimes.Jane testifies about a financial love contractBy the time of the 2023 New York encounter, Jane said she realised she no longer wanted to participate in these hotel nights. The pair had been together since 2021.During the trip, the two began bickering about them and she told Mr Combs she was done with this, she said.Mr Combs was defensive, she said, but told her they didnt have to continue. Still, later that night, she joined him for one.Prosecutors asked the woman several times why she stayed in a relationship with Mr Combs, even as she described feeling disgusted, repulsed after one rare encounter where she did not take drugs, which she said she took to make them seem less real.A federal prosecutor asked why she arranged the hotel night in New York if she had just told Mr Combs she no longer wanted to participate.Jane paused for a long time, at first saying it was hard to answer. She wanted to make her partner happy, she said.Prosecutors introduced the pairs financial ties. At the time, Mr Combs was paying Janes $10,000 per month rent, which he continues to do to this day.Jane testified that the pair made a love contract in which Mr Combs agreed to give her a monthly $10,000 allowance for two years. The rapper would hold the money over her head if she resisted hotel nights, she testified.She said one week, she was planning an all-star party with male escorts from their previous encounters.Mr Combs said he was hyped, but Jane eventually tried to back out. Prosecutors showed the jury texts between the two, where Jane sent photos to prove she was not feeling well.Mr Combs responded with messages she interpreted as threats to cut her off financially.In 2024, near the end of their relationship, Mr Combs told her that he had not known the hotel night encounters upset her and that she had not told him.But in reviewing her messages and notes from their relationship, Jane said she realised she expressed her unhappiness.In one exchange, she told Mr Combs she was upset that he had spent time with another woman after only engaging in a hotel night with her.I need a breather and a break from you, she texted him in November 2021.This doesnt make me feel good at all, your intentions are in plain sight.She also testified on Friday that the hotel nights took a physical toll on her.She told the court that she frequently contracted infections, and felt pelvic pain 100% of the time following the encounters.Jane recalled she probably did not tell Mr Combs about these physical issues because I just didnt want to indicate any negativity, she said.Earlier in the trial, R&B singer Cassandra Cassie Ventura took the witness stand, describing similar drug-fuelled sex encounters with Mr Combs, who she dated for more than a decade.She will continue to face questioning next week, with Mr Combs defence attorneys likely to be grilling her extensively about her time with the rap mogul.\n\nShe also alleged a network of employees helped procure drugs for the lengthy encounters, known as hotel nights or freak-offs, that left her in pain and with frequent infections.\n\nProsecutors have charged Mr Combs, 55, with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking, and transportation to engage in prostitution.He has pleaded not guilty to all charges.At the beginning of the trial, now in its fifth week, defence attorney Teny Geragos said the government had overstepped with its charges and are trying to portray consensual sex between adults as evidence of crimes.With Janes testimony, prosecutors are seeking to provide evidence that the music moguls activities were criminal.In one hotel night encounter in New York in 2023, Jane testified that she invited a male sex worker to fly from Atlanta, Georgia, to New York City to join her and Mr Combs for an encounter at the Trump International Hotel.Jane paid for his ticket, she testified, and afterward, she worked to ensure that an envelope containing several thousand dollars was left for the escort at the front desk.On another occasion, the woman testified that Mr Combss chief of staff Kristina Khorram allegedly instructed her to pick up drugs from Los Angeles to bring to Mr Combs Miami mansion.Ms Khorram has been named by prosecutors in court as a co-conspirator to Mr Combs, and could potentially testify.Sean Diddy Combs: Who is the US rapper accused of sex trafficking?Jane told the court that she picked the package up from a member of Mr Combs security, put it in her check-in luggage and flew to Miami, where she discovered it contained ecstasy.She also said she often saw Mr Combs call his assistants and security to bring drugs to the hotels where they had their encounters with escorts.One of the charges Mr Combs faces is racketeering.
