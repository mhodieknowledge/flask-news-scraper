I never thought I would have to face this alone, especially with a child on the way, a teary Madenyika told NewZimbabwe.com, her voice trembling with grief.\n\nHer anguish is compounded by the financial burden of a funeral that is yet to be done.\n\nI dont know how I will manage, she said, her eyes filled with tears.\n\nWe were supposed to build a life together, and now it feels like everything has been taken away from me.\n\nMadenyika hopes that justice will be served with the weight of her loss heavy on her shoulders.\n\nIf the law doesnt take its course, we are pleading to citizens of Zimbabwe to help us find something to haunt the ones who took away his life, said Madenyika.\n\nElipa Jimu, the now deceaseds mother, is at pains to accept reality that her son is no more. Worse still, she cannot imagine the burden of taking care of her widowed daughter-in-law and her unborn child.\n\nI am in pain over my sons death; him and Melisa were the ones taking care of me.\n\nHe left a pregnant wife. I dont even know how I am going to take care of her. The preparation for the baby has not been bought yet. There even is no money for the funeral. I dont know where I am going to even get it. My son was supposed to bury me first, but it is me who is burying him, lamented Jimu\n\nTaurayi Chiedziso, a neighbour and friend, voiced his frustration over the tragedy.\n\nThis matter would have been resolved without even involving the police because we are neighbours, we are a community.\n\nNow, Blessed has died leaving behind his wife who is also pregnant. That child will grow without a father, its so heartbreaking, said Chiedziso.\n\n",
