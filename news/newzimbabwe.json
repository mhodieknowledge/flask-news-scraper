Thismarks the final competition authority approval required across all applicable jurisdictions forthe implementation of the alternative transaction, said the company.\n\nTongaat Hulett and the Business Rescue Practitioners continue to work closely with Vision to finalise the implementation of the transaction.

You cant move, you cant breathe, you are stuck.\n\nYou have sacrificed everything to come here so that you can start a new life. When you get here, you see the treatment is not good.\n\nSophia said she was often out of the house for 16 hours a day for work, without any days off.\n\nShe felt unable to seek any other employment because her visa depended on the care company.\n\nThe union Unison has called for the government to take control of issuing Certificates of Sponsorship, to stop individual care companies having an enormous amount of power over workers.\n\nJordan Stapleton, the unions regional migrant lead, said: Were seeing migrant workers who are having to pay thousands of pounds in illegal fees, often working 16 hours a day, often without a break, not getting paid correctly, not being paid for travel time and being threatened with deportation and their visa being removed if they complain.\n\nAlthough the government has been revoking the licence of some of these employers, many employers are still operating because [employees] darent report them.\n\nJamila Duncan-Bosu, a solicitor from the charity Anti Trafficking and Labour Exploitation Unit (Atleu), said she had seen a rise in the number of inquiries from care workers seeking legal action over their experiences.\n\nThere needs to be a proper safety net, she said.\n\nBetween July 2022 and December 2024, the government said it had revoked more than 470 care providers licences, which enable companies to give visas to overseas workers across England, where there were concerns about abuse and exploitation.\n\nBut the move had left thousands of the workers unemployed.\n\nHome Office figuresreleased last monthrevealed more than 39,000 workers had been associated with these care providers since October 2022.\n\nTo help find the workers find new jobs, in March 2023, the then-Conservative government gave councils across England a total of 16m to tackle the exploitation of overseas workers, help find them new work and offer support.\n\nLeeds City Council runs the Yorkshire and Humber branch of the project.\n\nThe project said it had been approached by 4,355 workers who had been left without employment after having their visa sponsorships revoked.\n\nIt had successfully matched 71 people to new roles or new sponsors since it launched two years ago.\n\nA council spokesperson said a lack of Home Office-approved sponsor organisations in the area affected the number of job matches.\n\nWe recognise that there have been challenges across the region in finding workers new sponsors, which is in line with national recruitment issues faced by organisations in the care sector across the UK, they said.\n\nA government spokesperson said they were determined to protect migrant care workers from exploitation and abuse, including from employers that fail to provide work they had promised or non-payment of minimum wage.\n\nWhere there is evidence of illegal and unethical practices, we will always take action as swiftly as possible, they said.\n\nDan Archer, chief executive of home care service Visiting Angels, which has no involvement with Sophias case, said his company had chosen not to hire staff through the visa scheme.\n\nHe said in some cases hiring overseas workers was the wrong solution to fix the staffing shortage.\n\nIt feels exploitative, bringing people to the UK to ask them to do a job that not enough people in the UK are prepared to do, he said.\n\nInstead, Mr Archer said the company aimed to make the job more attractive to workers already in the UK, by offering better pay and avoiding zero-hour contracts.\n\nElaine Thompson, from Thurnscoe, near Barnsley, said she had relied on the firms care since her husband died five years ago.\n\nHer carer, mother-of-three Natalie Henstalk, said she enjoyed the job because she felt she was helping people and flexible hours meant she could also look after her children.\n\nI love my job. Its a good job to have, she said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA group of former white farmers who were displaced during the 2000s land reform programme has rejected the governments dollar-bonds compensation deal, citing that it is reliant on very uncertain and very high-risk long-term payouts.\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncube recently revealed that treasury bonds worth US$308 million and cash payments had been made to former white farm owners. Receipt of the payments was confirmed by ex-Commercial Farmers Union (CFU) leader Andrew Pascoe, whom the group now says was voted out in 2024 after agreeing to a deal they had rejected.\n\nNcube last week said after the cash payment the balance will be paid in treasury bonds with a 2% coupon and maturities of two years, which the former white farmers Compensation Steering Committee (CSC) has rejected.\n\nAngus Selby, a representative of the CSC said these bonds do not clear the debt but merely convert displaced farmers (Title Deed Holders) into bondholders reliant on very uncertain, very high-risk, very long-term payouts.\n\nThe payments are under the Global Compensation Deed (GCD) signed in 2020, where government agreed to pay a discounted US$3,5 billion to the former white farm owners.\n\nThe acting chairman of the former white farmers CSC Deon Theron said, the overwhelming majority of farmers supported this deal in a survey at the time but, to date, almost five (5) years on, nothing has been paid per this agreement.\n\nInstead, in 2023 the government offered an alternative payment schedule in Government Treasury Bills over ten years heavily weighted towards years 5-10, a token 2 percent interest rate was added which compares to regional USD interest rates of 10-20%.\n\nThe revised offer was put to the farmers in April 2023 via a formal survey in which it was rejected by the majority of farmers. Whereas 3100 voted in favour of the 2020 proposal, only 782 voted for the adjusted offer in 2023.\n\nHe added that the few farmers who have accepted the governments deal did so because they are destitute and in urgent need of money for food and healthcare.\n\nTheron revealed this was clearly communicated to the government in an official correspondence.\n\nDespite this rejection, the government pushed ahead with the revised offer that became known as the Farmers Compensation Agreement (FCA) in which 378 farms have now (nearly two years later) received initial payments of 1% of their share of the discounted offer.\n\nThe bottom line is that governments recent payments represent a tiny fraction of the GCDs $3.5 billion which is already a substantial discount on the actual value of the properties, and these payments have reached fewer than 10% of farmers, stated Theron.\n\nThe FCA was originally presented as interim relief payments for distressed farmers, but is now being repositioned and repackaged as a comprehensive compensation solution.\n\nThis is simply not the case.\n\nThe Land Compensation Committee approved compensation for 740 former white farmers, which the former white farmers committee says is only a fraction of the over 4,500 who were displaced by the land grabs.\n\nIn reality, only a small token payment has been made and thousands of farmers, the significant majority by number remain uncompensated, Theron said.\n\nLater former President Robert Mugabe pioneered the land reform programme in 2000 which saw violent evictions of more than 4000 white farmers.\n\n",

It is the worlds largest free trade area by number of participating countries, connecting 1,3 billion people across 55 countries.\n\nPresenting the group performance for the period ended December 31 2024, ZHL board chairman, Desmond Matete, said going forward, regional expansion will be a priority.\n\nAs we look to 2025, the Group is focused on regional expansion and market diversification, strengthening operations across Sub-Saharan Africa, leveraging on the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to access new opportunities, he said.\n\nHe said a key priority for this year is the implementation of Phase 2 of the amalgamation exercise through the potential listing of Emeritus International on the Botswana Stock Exchange. The listing will upscale the balance sheets of the regional subsidiaries, improving underwriting capacity to enhance competitiveness while exposing the Group to international best practice.\n\nAdditionally, the Eagle REIT listing in 2025 is expected to unlock shareholder value, enhance brand visibility and optimise asset returns. To drive operational efficiency, the Group is accelerating its digital transformation agenda, enhancing customer experiences through technology-driven insurance and wealth management solutions. A key focus is ensuring responsible data usage and stakeholder protection, reinforcing ZHLs position as a trusted financial services provider.\n\nDuring the period, insurance contract revenue recorded a significant increase of 24%, from USD50.0 million to USD61.86 million, attributable to strong business growth in key business segments, namely life and pension, local reinsurance, and the Mozambique reinsurance operations, with a combined contribution of 63% up from 61% in 2023.\n\nOverall, the key revenue growth drivers were increased market share locally, thanks to a diverse range of products; external business partnerships, new life business written and expansion into the rest of Africa through the Groups regional business units, added Matete.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nHARARE residents have called for heads to roll at the City Council following revelations that senior officials corruptly approved the construction of a double-storey building in Vainona despite glaring irregularities.\n\nThe double-storey building, situated at the corner of Alpes and Grant roads, is one of many construction projects that the City of Harare improperly approved.\n\nThe building, which is nearing completion, is set for demolition after it emerged at the Commission of Inquiry probing the operations of the City Council that it violated by-laws.\n\nThis will set the stage for a potential legal tussle between the City of Harare and the owner, as the structure is almost complete.\n\nIn a statement, the Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) said the City Council should institute a special committee to probe the approval of plans of this nature.\n\nThe Combined Harare Residents Association is urgently calling for the Harare City Council to conduct a Special Council Meeting to constitute an Investigation Committee to interrogate the error that was made in approving the construction of a double-storey building by the local authority on an illegal piece of land in Vainona, and take disciplinary measures, including the dismissal of all employees found liable for this costly decision.\n\nIn terms of Section 100(1)(a) of the Urban Councils Act [29:15], the Harare City Council is empowered to set up a Special Committee to conduct investigations, especially on pertinent issues of this nature. Considering the magnitude of this issue and the oversight function of the council as provided in the Urban Councils Act [29:15], turning a blind eye on this matter will make elected representatives (councillors) accomplices, read the statement.\n\nWith the Council realising that it erred in approving the plan, residents will bear the brunt of paying the compensation costs as the building faces demolition. The double-storey building infringes on the frontage line and extends onto Alpes Road.\n\nCHRA said residents cannot shoulder the consequences of the City of Harares rushed approval.\n\nWe affirm that residents and ratepayers of Harare cannot bear the consequences and cost of this gross incompetence and maladministration within the City of Harares planning division without disciplinary measures being taken, read the statement.\n\nThe Harare City Council has come under intense scrutiny after overseeing the approval of questionable plans.\n\nAuthorities at Town House have conceded that certain plans were approved without due diligence.\n\nCHRA said the Vainona building is not an isolated case, as many approved projects violate the council bylaws.\n\nThe Vainona case is similar to other construction activities that have been approved by the local authority in Ecologically Sensitive Areas (wetlands) gazetted by the Government of Zimbabwe across the city.\n\nWe suspect that there were some underhand dealings relating to this matter, hence we call on the local authority to conduct an urgent investigation, read the statement further.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nJoburg-based activist Moreboys Munetsi has intervened to assist the family of a Zimbabwean man, Emmanuel Mahamba, who was brutally murdered in a horrific incident which has sent shockwaves in South Africa.\n\nIn a video, widely shared on social media, Mahamba is seen seated on the road while a Ford Ranger runs over him repeatedly. He died at the scene.\n\nGauteng police said they were still searching for the motorist implicated in the brutal death of a man following a heated dispute.\n\nMunetsi, a lawyer by profession, said he was providing legal support to the victims family.\n\nFor now I am giving the family legal support. At the same time, we were encouraging the Zimbabwean community in Joburg to raise funeral money through contributions. The funeral contributions are coming from the Zimbabwean community, Munetsi told IOL.\n\nMunetsi is popular among the South African and Zimbabwean communities in Gauteng as an anti-crime and social cohesion activist.\n\nHe is also a successful businessman who runs an international company, Greathope Insurance.\n\nSpeaking about the incident, Munetsi said: The body of Emmanuel has been repatriated already for burial in Zimbabwe.\n\nEmmanuels murder has attracted international news headlines, with many social media users questioning why the alleged killer has not been arrested.\n\nThe incident unfolded on April 5, 2025, in Rivonia, Sandton, and culminated in a tragic and violent confrontation that ended in Mahamba being run over by a Ford Ranger bakkie multiple times.\n\nOn his Facebook page, which has more than 144,000 followers, Munetsi held a live conversation with Ntombi, the woman who was involved in a relationship with Mahamba, while she lived with her other romantic partner.\n\nThe Ugandan man, who has two children with Ntombi, allegedly murdered Emmanuel in the bakkie attack.\n\nI agree that I once dated Emmanuel in January, and we broke up in February. Yes, we were in a relationship. We broke up because some Ugandans recorded a video of me when I was with the guy (Emmanuel). My baby daddy is a Ugandan. So I broke up with Emmanuel for my safety, for my kids and also for the sake of Emmanuel. I stopped talking to Emmanuel.\n\nNtombi said on the fateful day, Emmanuel and some Ugandan men who lived at the same house with, came over to her work premises. Ntombis baby daddy was already at the business premises, where motorbike parts are sold.\n\nLater on, I heard some noise, people fighting. When I went outside, I asked Emmanuel what he was doing, but he did not even respond to me; he only looked at me. He was holding a stone, and he threw it away. He picked it again and hit the vehicles (wind) screen. That is when my baby daddy got angry, went to Emmanuel and beat him, she said.\n\nSUSPECT WANTED FOR MURDER\n\nPolice are looking for a suspect who was driving a black Ford Ranger Double cab wiyh registration number KV10WLGP in Sandton, Rivonia next to Mzanzi building anyone with information can contact the police on 08600 10111.pic.twitter.com/HC2fq60B80\n\nIn the video, Ntombi can be seen screaming, frantically trying to stop the Ford Ranger driver.\n\nNarrating how she fell in love with the deceased man, Ntombi said she met Emmanuel at Rivonia, Sandton, as he used to come to the shop that she works at, buying motorbike parts.\n\nShe said when she met Emmanuel this year, she was still involved with the Ugandan man although the relationship was experiencing some difficulties. Ntombi was living with the Ugandan man when she started dating Emmanuel.\n\nI had to date Emmanuel, she told Munetsi in the Facebook live session.\n\nNtombi has two children with the Ugandan man and the two have been in a relationship for around three years.\n\nThe Ugandan men who came to the premises with Emmanuel, according to Ntombi, had previously recorded a video of her and Emmanuel and they had also informed Ntombis other boyfriend, the Ugandan man who drives a Ford Ranger.\n\nEmmanuel had not told me that he was staying (at a house) with Ugandans. I was at Emmanuels place and I went out, they recorded the video and sent it to my boyfriend, the baby daddy. In the video, I was walking while holding hands with Emmanuel. I then told Emmanuel that we had to end our relationship, she said.\n\nNtombi said she was confronted angrily by her baby daddy over her romantic relationship with Emmanuel. She said the Ugandan man was very angry, and she decided to end things with Emmanuel.\n\nPolice spokesperson, Colonel Dimakatso Nevhuhulwi, said police received a complaint regarding the incident and upon arrival, they found a man lying on the side of the road with injuries all over his body.\n\nThe paramedics declared him dead on the scene. According to information at hand, the victim reportedly argued with the shop owner and allegedly hit the shop owners vehicle with a brick, breaking the windscreen. The shop owner reportedly came out and drove over his body several times before fleeing the scene, said Nevhuhulwi.\n\n",
