            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nThe International Monetary Fund said it would like to see the ZiG fully becoming a national currency, as it weighs whether to place Zimbabwe on a staff-monitored program.\n\nThe ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, succeeded the Zimbabwean dollar in April 2024 after multiple crashes. Its the countrys sixth attempt since 2009 to replace the dollar as the southern African nations main transacting currency, but is yet to succeed.\n\nSeveral measures will need to be adopted to boost ZiG usage, including deepening the foreign-exchange market to ensure full price discovery, said Wojciech Maliszewski, the Washington-based lenders mission chief, who is in Zimbabwe to review its request for a new SMP. The nations last program ended abruptly in 2019 after the central bank printed money that fueled the collapse of the local currency.\n\nRight now we see good stability in the official market and we also see a convergence between the parallel and official rate, he told reporters Monday after meeting Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa in the capital, Harare. Ideally, we would like to see an elimination of this gap, we would like to see one exchange rate.\n\nStill, the ZiGs 43% devaluation in September to narrow the gap between the official and unofficial rate and its inconvertibility has led citizens to favor dollars.\n\nThe ZiG traded little changed on Tuesday at 26.96 against the dollar and exchanged hands at 32 to 35 on the parallel market.\n\nThe Washington-based lender said it isnt pushing for more exchange rate depreciation but for the two rates to converge supported by government fiscal discipline.\n\nThere is a good chance that these rates will converge, Maliszewski said.\n\nFinance Minister Mthuli Ncube last month at the annual meetings of the African Development Bank said he expected the SMP to be finalized by the end of June. The program would bring Zimbabwe closer toward revamping its $21 billion debt pile with creditors that want assurances that its authorities are pursuing prudent fiscal and monetary policies.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nTHE University of Zimbabwe (UZ) has withheld the salaries of striking lecturers as turmoil continues at the institution.\n\nThe lecturers have now reached 58 days of industrial action, demanding a salary increase that aligns with Zimbabwes soaring cost of living.\n\nWhile UZ has remained silent on the strike, it has retaliated by withholding salaries from the defiant lecturers, who are steadfast in their demand for a return to pre-2018 wages of US$2,250 per month for junior staff  up from the current US$230.\n\nObvious Vengeyi, spokesperson for the Association of University Teachers (AUT), condemned the salary deductions as an attempt to force an end to the strike.\n\nOf course, it is an act of trying to force our members to return to work for the US$230 they initially rejected. Its a way of arm-twisting certain members of our community to resume teaching.\n\nMany here who have not been paid have resolved that, whether they receive the US$230 or not, they will not return. The majority of us have not been paid  yes. But we remain committed. Until junior lecturers get US$2,250, we will not go back to class, said Vengeyi.\n\nThe universitys latest move follows its hiring of adjunct lecturers last month to fill gaps left by the striking staff.\n\nHowever, the AUT has dismissed this as futile, claiming most replacements lack the qualifications to teach at a university level.\n\nThere is no teaching happening at the university. No supervision is taking place. A few scabs have been hired to replace sort of  the lecturers on strike, said Vengeyi further.\n\nThe prolonged strike has disrupted examinations, with planned sittings facing further delays, potentially derailing the academic year.\n\nLast month, six students were arrested after staging flash protests demanding the lecturers return, signalling the growing unrest on campus.\n\n",

            "content": "The Star\n\nA memorial service for Zambias former President Edgar Chagwa Lungu is being held Tuesday at the Cathedral in Pretoria, South Africa, under a cloud of political tension and unresolved conflict between his family and the Zambian government.\n\nMourners, including members of the Patriotic Front (PF), Lungus former ruling party, filled the cathedral as emotional tributes were paid to the late statesman.\n\nHowever, the atmosphere was not one of peace.\n\nInstead, it reflected the deepening rift over Lungus legacy, his cause of death, and the governments controversial handling of his passing.\n\nThe 68-year-old former president died last Thursday in a South African hospital, where he had been undergoing treatment for an undisclosed illness.\n\nSince his death, speculation and accusations have surfaced, with some PF leaders claiming Lungu may have been poisoned  a charge the Zambian government has not addressed publicly.\n\nAccording to hospital sources, government officials allegedly tried to repatriate Lungus body to Zambia without the familys consent.\n\nMedical staff say they were intimidated and threatened, prompting outrage from PF leaders and human rights groups alike.\n\nSpeaking at a media roundtable in Sandton, Johannesburg, PF Secretary General Mangani Nakacinda condemned the governments actions, calling them a calculated political manoeuvre to seize control of the narrative. Nakacinda added,\n\nThis is no longer just about mourning a former president  it is about defending his dignity and our democracy.\n\nOne of the most contentious issues is the Zambian governments reported insistence on taking full control of Lungus funeral arrangements.\n\nThe Lungu family, backed by PF allies, has resisted this, citing concerns about trust and transparency. So far, the standoff has stalled any official state funeral plans.\n\nAdding to the pain and confusion, two of Lungus children were allegedly denied permission to leave Zambia to attend their fathers memorial in South Africa. Family representatives say the travel ban is another example of the administrations deliberate cruelty.\n\nInside Zambia, the situation is increasingly volatile. PF members have vowed to fight until the end to expose what they claim is a campaign to erase Lungus political legacy and prevent scrutiny into the events leading to his death.\n\nMeanwhile, the government appears determined to maintain authority over the funeral process, citing protocol and national interest.\n\nThe late presidents political comeback in 2023 had reignited tensions in the country. After years of relative silence, Lungu announced his intention to run in the 2026 elections, challenging the ruling United Party for National Development (UPND) and its leader, President Hakainde Hichilema.\n\nIn response, the Constitutional Court ruled him ineligible, sparking legal and political protests.Shortly after, Lungu was stripped of all state benefits, including security and medical support, further isolating him.\n\nPF leaders claim these actions left him vulnerable, even hindering access to vital medical treatment in the months before his death.\n\nAs his body remains in South Africa and legal negotiations continue behind the scenes, todays memorial has become more than a moment of remembrance  it is a flashpoint in a deepening national crisis.\n\nThe treatment of former President Lungu is a reflection of the state of our democracy, said Brian Mundubile, a senior PF figure.\n\nThis is about justice, truth, and respect  not just for him, but for all Zambians.With the cause of Lungus death still unconfirmed and calls for an independent investigation growing louder, todays service may not be the end of mourning but the beginning of a prolonged battle for answers.\n\n",
