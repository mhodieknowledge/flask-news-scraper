            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nSocial media personality Melody Natalie Mhandu, popularly known as Enchantress, was on Thursday hauled before a Mbare magistrate accused of casting a spell on her former friend Tatenda Butau.\n\nMhandu (34) was charged with engaging in practices commonly associated with witchcraftas defined in section 98 (i) of the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act Chapter 9.23.\n\nShe was released unconditionally after briefly appearing in court.\n\nThe state alleged that on August 4 and at Churu Farm, Mhandu unlawfully committed the offence by writing Tatendas name and others on a red cloth which she wrapped around a knife and sprinkled snuff powder before burying it under amuhachatree in a bid to cast a spell on her.\n\nAccording to State papers, Mhandu did this with the help of a traditional healer, Christine Matashu, also known as Manjenjenje.\n\nHer former helper, Elizabeth Mharirire, wrote a statement telling the court that Mhandu asked her to accompany her to see Manjenjenje when the ritual was performed.\n\nMharirire said she later found snuff powder in her room and bathroom before confronting Mhandu about it.\n\nThe two had an altercation before she told Mhandu that she could no longer work for her, given the circumstances.\n\nThe maid later told Butau that her former employer had bewitched her.\n\nShe then accompanied her and her boyfriend to the spot where Mhandu allegedly performed the rituals.\n\nButau dug up the cloth and knife before she confronted Mhandu.\n\nThe matter was also reported to the police.\n\nMhandu denies the allegations.\n\nThrough her lawyer, Mhandu said she was never at Churu Farm on August 4 as alleged.\n\nShe will specifically deny putting Tatenda Butaus name or any other name for that purpose on a red cloth as alleged or at all.\n\nShe will deny having wrapped any red cloth with a dagger and snuff powder and burying it underground as alleged or at all.\n\nShe will deny having any intention to harm or realising the real risk or possibility of harming any person as alleged or at all.\n\nShe will tell the court that she does not know any ritualist by whatever name. She never visited any either alone or with any other person as alleged or at all.\n\nShe did not cast any spell on anyone as alleged or at all, read her defence outline.\n\nThe lawyer said his client will tell the court that the charges are a malicious fabrication of a vindictive former maid who is manipulating the current bad blood between the accused and the complainant.\n\nThe former maid had been relieved of her duties and is bitter about it.\n\nMhandu also said Butau filed the current report as a social media blitz against her and for the purpose of countering a report she made against her at Highlands Police Station on 4 August 2025 under RRB Number 6440490.\n\nShe will also state that the allegations against her do not amount to any practice associated with witchcraft.\n\nFurther, the allegations are vague and embarrassing. They are only meant as a public show for the purposes of causing embarrassment and humiliation of the accused, said the lawyer, praying that the court returns a verdict of not guilty and acquits her of any wrongdoing.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nMovement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Douglas Mwonzora has stressed the importance of unity among opposition parties in Zimbabwe, urging them to work together to reverse the trend of poor electoral performance.\n\nHis remarks follow the recently held Epworth ward 6by-election,where the ruling party Zanu PFs candidate Civilised Bushe secured 3,022 votes, beating MDC-Ts Alice Nyahunzvi, who managed just 120 votes. Independent candidate Peter Nyapetwa received only 23 votes. The main opposition party, Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), did not participate in the by-election.\n\nMwonzora, who boycotted the 2023 presidential elections, surprisingly fielded a candidate in Epworth who performed poorly, triggering widespread criticism from opposition supporters.\n\nSpeaking in an X space on Wednesday, Mwonzora said the by-election was a test to assess whether the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) had implemented electoral reforms.\n\nZEC produced a document called a strategy towards free and fair elections, so we decided to test ZECs attempted electoral reforms empirically. ZEC failed dismally in the test.\n\nThere was rampant vote buying, as Epworth residents were being given food hampers on election day. We have video evidence of that. People were receiving EcoCash and being told to vote for Zanu PF.\n\nThey also received threats from Zanu PF and were told that if they voted for the MDC, the 16,000 houses in Epworth would be destroyed.\n\nWe, the MDC party, were given a soft copy of the voters roll, but it would not open. We made a formal complaint to ZEC, which did nothing about it, Mwonzora said.\n\nMwonzora urged other opposition parties to unite against Zanu PF instead of mocking him for losing the by-election.\n\nThe poor performance is not confined to the MDC; it is a trend, and as the opposition, we must work to change it.\n\nThere is a need to bury the hatchet. As we have seen, there is no winner in a losing team. We need to work together. If we are not careful, Zimbabwe will become a mono-state.\n\nYes, we may want to score political points by mocking the MDC, which lost only one by-election, yet other opposition parties lost 45, Mwonzora said.\n\n",

As defence minister he tackled jihadist activity that was brewing in the northern border in Burkina Faso.\n\nIn 2022, a France-based NGO, Promediation, said its research showed that jihadist groups had recruited between 200 and 300 young Ghanaians.\n\nViolence in the area has also been on the rise, with concerns that jihadists may be trying to exploit communal in-fighting between rival communities in northern Ghana.\n\nBoamahs book A Peaceful Man In An African Democracy, about former president John Atta Mills, was due to come out later in the year.\n\nMuhammed was at the forefront of the battle against illegal gold mining, which has wrecked the environment and contaminated rivers and lakes.\n\nProtests against the practice, known locally as Galamsey, peaked during Mahamas run for the presidency last year.\n\n",
