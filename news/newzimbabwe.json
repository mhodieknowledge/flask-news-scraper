            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nCASSAVA Technologies, the tech firm founded by Zimbabwean telecoms magnate Strive Masiyiwa, dealt a blow to President Emmerson Mnangagwas Open for Business mantra last week.\n\nTheir announcement that they would be building Africas first artificial intelligence factory in South Africa, in partnership with leading AI chipmaker Nvidia, represents a missed opportunity for Zimbabwe.\n\nMnangagwa, fresh from seizing power in November 2017 via a military coup, threw open doors to the world, pitching Zimbabwe as the premier business destination.\n\nOn paper, this looked like a masterstroke strategy to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). However, time and again, the government has been its own worst enemy, shooting itself in the foot with policies and practices that deter investors.\n\nNvidias supercomputers, powered by graphic processing units, or GPUs (the workhorse chips behind AI), will be deployed at Cassavas data centres in South Africa from as early as June, with plans to roll them out across the companys other facilities in Egypt, Kenya, Morocco, and Nigeria.\n\nThis is a clear indication that, where AI development is concerned, South Africa will be punching above its weight in the coming years.\n\nSpeaking in Kigali, Rwanda, at the Inaugural Global AI Summit on Africa, Masiyiwa was blunt about his reasons for side-lining Zimbabwe and other African nations due to their less-than-stellar business environments.\n\nMasiyiwa emphasised the need for African leaders to cultivate a pro-investor ecosystem.\n\nI cannot overemphasise the need for our leaders to create an ecosystem for investment because people like me stepping forward and going out to raise billions of dollars to buy these chips, we can only go to where it is investor friendly, he said.\n\nHe added, underlining his point with a stark warning: We wont come back and tell you your investment environment doesnt work. We just walk away. So, weve got to talk to each other. Youve got to listen to what we feel we need to comfortably raise the capital to do this.\n\nInformation and Communication Technology (ICT) Minister Tatenda Mavetera acknowledged the uphill battle in creating a favourable business climate that attracts investment, particularly in the ICT sector.\n\nOur ministry is prioritising: Streamlining regulations to fast-track tech infrastructure projects, Incentivising R&D (research and development) partnerships and private-sector co-investment and building secure digital ecosystems with reliable power, connectivity and talent pipelines, Mavetera posted on her X account Saturday.\n\nShe added: More investor friendly policies in the ICT sector are essential and urgent. Lets deepen this dialogue.\n\nWe are working on a lot of policies e.g ICT start up and venture capital policy, fintech and cryptocurrency policy and also look at implementing tax incentives in the ICT sector so that we position Zimbabwe as the next tech hub, Mavetera further wrote.\n\nMasiyiwa famously navigated a hostile environment in the 1990s to establish Econet Wireless and has publicly thanked the late Vice President Joshua Nkomo for his support in founding Econet.\n\nMnangagwas critics were quick to accuse the Zanu-PF leader of a monumental blunder.\n\nMasiyiwas decision to establish the AI factory in South Africa has been interpreted by many as an own goal that has left Zimbabwe in the digital doldrums.\n\n",

            "content": "By Bloomberg\n\nA LIQUIDITY crunch in Zimbabwe is deepening the economys embrace of the US dollar and undermining the bullion-backed currency introduced by the government almost a year ago.\n\nThe ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, which began trading on April 8, is the southern African nations sixth attempt since 2009 at replacing the dollar with a functional local currency. It has not gone well.\n\nIn September, after persistent weakness against the dollar, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe devalued the ZiG by 43%, raised the key interest rate to 35% from 20% and increased cash reserve requirements to steady the currency. It has depreciated almost 4% this year.\n\nThe stability measures have led to an economy swimming in dollars, said Eddie Cross, a Harare-based independent economist and former monetary policy committee member.\n\nThe liquidity crunch has now killed the ZiG, he said.\n\nThe ZiG has retreated as a currency of trade and effectively we have dollarized.\n\nThe tight monetary policy stance has fuelled a slump with stocks plunging on Harares main exchange, consumer prices falling 0.1% in March and ZiG supply scant on the unofficial market.\n\nThe ZiG is being used to settle mostly minor transactions including utility and tax payments and a portion of civil servant wages. The rest is paid in dollars. The currency cannot be used to pay for essentials including fuel, rent and medicines.\n\nThe highest denomination ZiG banknote is worth about $7.50  enough to buy six loaves of bread.\n\nDespite being backed by more than $550 million in gold and cash reserves, used as a selling point to win public trust, its limited use in salient sectors of the economy makes differences with its failed predecessors seem cosmetic, said Jacques Nel, head of Africa macro at Oxford Economics.\n\nIt would have taken something special to convince Zimbabweans that this time is different, he said.\n\nBumpy ride\n\nNot even the more than 30% surge in the bullion price since the gold-backed currencys adoption has helped.\n\nPart of the problem is that the level of hard currency reserves backing it are woefully inadequate, because the nation has been locked out of capital markets since a debt default in 1999, said Hasnain Malik, an emerging-market strategist at Tellimer in Dubai.\n\nIts demise should be no surprise, he said.\n\nStill, policymakers dont plan to loosen their tight monetary stance or ditch the ZiG. Last week, the central bank kept the key rate at 35% and added that it would remain vigilant to any emerging risks to inflation and exchange rate stability.\n\nIts going to be a bumpy ride, but we are fully committed, Innocent Matshe, the RBZs deputy governor told business leaders on Feb. 13 in the capital, Harare.\n\nThe currencys survival depends on the ruling partys support, said Tony Hawkins, an independent economic consultant in Harare and former economics professor at the University of Zimbabwe.\n\nHistory has shown that every new currency in Zimbabwe has a shorter lifespan than its predecessor and with the ZiG not really being used it could be headed for the same fate, he said.\n\nWhat else is the ZiG used for except arbitrage opportunities and to pay civil servants, Hawkins, said.\n\nI cant see the ZiG surviving that long.\n\n",

I also stated that the Presidents family were involved.\n\nOn Tuesday I requested a meeting with the President and told him that I recognised that I should not have involved his family, and I apologised unreservedly.\n\nHe expressed concern about the substance of my general allegations on the magnitude of corruption and asked that I substantiate this. I agreed to provide him with a dossier of what I understand is going on. On the issue of his children being involved, he asked who was implicated and I identified 3 (three) of his sons.\n\nOn Wednesday I returned to State House to discuss this further with the three men involved and I outlined what I was hearing but could not provide firm evidence to support these allegations and rumors. I again apologised and said I would withdraw my statement on this matter, reads the letter.\n\n",

Dzodzo was accused of attempting to steal gold.\n\nThe mine has operated illegally since 2023, its licence having expired. This unlawful operation has continued with the full knowledge of the government through the Environmental Management Agency (EMA), as confirmed to Parliament two years ago.\n\nIn a statement Thursday, CNRG called for a comprehensive investigation charging that the company has an apparent disregard for human life.\n\nWe also call for a thorough investigation into the killing of Alfred Dzodzo, with those responsible held accountable under the Zimbabwean law, reads part of the statement.\n\nAdditionally, an audit should be carried out on Sino Africa Huijins financial activities, particularly its alleged involvement in gold smuggling and organized crime, their statement reads.\n\nFollowing Dzodzos death, CNRG has urged the Zimbabwean government to shut down the mine, expel the Chinese operatorswho are understood to be working without a valid licenceand grant mining rights to local artisanal miners. They argue these miners deserve to benefit from the natural resources in their communities.\n\nIn light of this, CNRG calls on the government to permanently shut down Sino Africa Huijin and open the site to Zimbabwean artisanal miners under the auspices of Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation and Minerals Marketing Corporation of Zimbabwe. This will ensure Zimbabwean nationals can benefit from their natural resources whilst also ensure government generate revenues, part of the statement reads.\n\nSino Africa Huijin is no stranger to controversy. In January this year, Taurai Dozva died mysteriously while on night duty at the mine. The Chinese offered his family US$2,000 as compensation  a plaster on a gaping wound.\n\nIn November 2023, CNRG implored Parliament to shut down the mine due to environmental crimes and exploitative labour practices. The company also reportedly smuggles unprocessed gold out of the country, robbing Zimbabwe of crucial revenue, a financial haemorrhage bleeding the nation dry.\n\nReports of killings and abusive labour practices by Chinese nationals at Zimbabwean mining sites are rampant, a grim tapestry woven with threads of exploitation.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Environmental Law Society (ZELA) and other labour rights activists have condemned these killings.\n\nA violent confrontation at Bijou Farm in Gweru on January 21 further illustrates the tension. A worker demanding unpaid wages clashed with supervisors, igniting outrage on social media and strengthening calls for action against exploitative Chinese investors.\n\nThe incident involved Kholwani Dube, an excavator operator employed by Ming Chang Sino-Africa Mining Investments.\n\nBeyond its appalling human rights and safety record, Sino Africa Huijin is accused of siphoning gold from Zimbabwe. Workers allege that much of the gold they mine goes undeclared, disappearing into the pockets of the Chinese owners.\n\nDzodzos killing has reignited the debate surrounding the treatment of Zimbabwean workers by Chinese investors, with critics accusing authorities of turning a blind eye to labour violations, leaving a bitter taste of injustice.\n\n",

We need to fix these roads, which were damaged by miners as they ferried their produce to the market.\n\nWe realise that the government alone has no capacity to single handedly repair these roads so concerned stakeholders have to join hands in solving the problem, he said.\n\nMakwiranzou said the programme, which is being rolled out on the basis of mutual engagement and dialogue has seen miners in the area being asked to assist with machinery like front-end loaders and graders to repair the roads.\n\nHe said the 11 mining companies in Mutoko North constituency can assist with trucks to ferry gravel as well as fuel to capacitate villagers and the local authority in realising their objectives.\n\nEnvironmentalists have attributed the ongoing concerted efforts to CSOs like Silveira House for implementing programmes fostering engagement and dialogue, allowing communities to express their concerns to mining companies, political actors, and policymakers.\n\nThis engagement has seen the culmination of community cohesion which is vital for promoting responsible and sustainable mining practices, ultimately, amplifying the voice and agency of mining-impacted communities.\n\nWhile we are aware that CSR is voluntary, we will be using engagement and dialogue to source for these resources.\n\nWe also need assistance with school furniture, ICT consumables in learning. Specifically, it is a pilot programme in Mutoko North, we will roll it out as a national programme, added Makwiranzou.\n\n",

With Gerda Steyn to her left, the Entsika Athletic Club starlet threw down the gauntlet to the darling of South African road running.\n\nThis race is not all about Gerda, the South Africa-based Zimbabwean athlete said to rapturous applause.\n\nIts also about me against myself. Anything can happen (in a race). Why should we have fear and say Gerda is here shes gonna win. No! I am not gonna do that.\n\nIt was a breath of fresh air really, Tshumas boldness breaking the somewhat monotonous nature of road races where Steyn is involved  the rest of the athletes often being afraid to rate themselves as capable of challenging the Smiling Assassin.\n\nTshuma has shown herself to be a competitive runner in the ultras with last years edition and then going on to get gold (fifth place) in her maiden Comrades Marathon later in the year.\n\nIntent on challenging Steyn as she is, the woman who is married to 2023 Totatlasport Two Oceans Marathon champion and last years third-place finisher Givemore Mudzinganyama is using the 56 km race as preparation for her second World Major Marathon.\n\nMy training has gone very well. I am just here for a long run anyway Gerda, she said, turning to look at the multiple champion and record holder as if to say dont worry you can keep your title.\n\nThe amusement in the room knew no bounds as just about everyone, including Steyn herself burst into laughter.\n\nGerda, I am preparing for the London Marathon. But the Two Oceans Marathon is my favourite marathon so I just said let me come do my last long run. And theres only one month left before Comrades so I just wanted to check their fitness for Comrades.\n\nSuch confidence! Such bravado! It can only augur well for the sport to have someone who dares to challenge the road running queen who is going for a sixth successive victory in the 56km world famous ultra.\n\nSteyn remained her ice cool self though amidst Tshumas goading and described it as a blessing to be back again to do the Two Oceans.\n\nThe distance is where my sweet spot lies and also the Two Oceans in the few years since I started running opened so many doors for me and winning it in 2018 really made me believe I can be a champion.\n\nAnd I dont know if my career would have been the same way if it wasnt for it. And each year Ive managed to come back and push a little step up and push myself to see what I can do.\n\nWhile the way she has registered her five victories in the race always seemed to suggest she finds it easy, Steyn says the Two Oceans is a tough challenge.\n\nThe Two Oceans is not like any other race. It is not the Comrades and it is not a (standard) marathon.\n\nSo, you need to be really specific about how you prepare for this race, making sure that youve got the speed in your legs as well as the strength to conquer the hills. So the uniqueness of the race is really something that draws me to it year after year.\n\nIs she going to break the record yet again?\n\nIts always difficult for me to talk about the record and I dont want to sound like a record on repeat  pun intended  because especially for today the contenders for this race tomorrow is specifically strong.\n\nAnd it is not just those who are sitting here but there will be more at the start tomorrow.\n\nIt is going to be a fast race and it could be very tactical with the competition being so strong, it is very difficult to speak about the record.\n\nIn my personal space I have to have the confidence that I can break the record; that I am able to push myself to the limit and  first of all to win the race and second of all to break the record.\n\nAnd perhaps to win the race tomorrow might require breaking the record. So, I am prepared for every scenario and we will just have to wait and see how it all unfolds.\n\nShe now also knows that there is a Nobuhle Tshuma who is eager to take her on.\n\n",

            "content": "By Tracy-Lynn Ruiters l Weekend Argus\n\nCora Tannie Cora Snyman Louw, born on April 4, 1918, in Klipdam near Kimberley, South Africa has lived through an extraordinary century of history, witnessing world events and personal milestones that few can fathom.\n\nBorn towards the end of World War I, she has lived through two World Wars, two pandemics, and witnessed the rapid transformation of technologyfrom horse-drawn carts to self-driving cars.\n\nHer journey is not just one of longevity but of an incredible life well-lived, marked by wisdom, and deep appreciation for family and lifes small pleasures.\n\nAs one of the first nurses at Groote Schuur Hospital, Tannie Coras career was centered on care, dedication, and an eagerness to learn.\n\nShe married a doctor in 1942, with whom she had two children, Leon and Zandra. Her passion for floristry began when her youngest was just nine years old, and she later expanded her business into an estate agency.\n\nI went through the thick and thin of life\n\nHer life took her to Durban, Johannesburg, and back to Cape Town, where she lived out her later years near the beach, developing a close bond with her neighbour, Sylwa Malan.\n\nIn her later years, Tannie Cora moved to the then Huis Lckhoff, now known as Rosebank House, at the age of 81, where she enjoyed a rich community life filled with music, scripture studies, and visits from loved ones.\n\nNow, at 107 years old, Tannie Cora has become a living testament to resilience and a source of wisdom for those around her, imparting life lessons that include the importance of family unity, fairness, humor, and staying engaged with life.\n\nJames Wichary, the Manager of Rosebank House, recalled the first day he met Tannie Cora. She was one of the first people I met when I started here, Wichary shared.\n\nEveryone talked about Tannie Cora, and when I heard she was 106, I thought, That means she was born in 1918, absolutely astonishing! She lived through two world wars, two pandemics, and witnessed the world transform. She is like a living, breathing encyclopedia.\n\nWichary admires Tannie Coras vitality, noting, You can still have a conversation with her.\n\nThe energy is vibrant and engaging, and she knows whats going on around her. She enjoys family visits, soaking up the sun, and is quite funny.\n\nStaff member Allison Goodheart also fondly remembers when Tannie Cora was wheeled into the sunroom on her birthday, beaming with delight.\n\nShes still very aware of everything around her, Goodheart said.\n\nWhen we brought her cake, she looked at it and said, Beautiful!\n\nWhen asked how she feels at 107, Tannie Cora replied with a twinkle in her eye: Happy chappy! I still look 91, and then cracked a little smirk, adding a playful touch to the conversation.\n\nHer great-niece, Margi Marshland, shared how Tannie Cora had been feeling after her recent birthday, which they had feared might be her last.\n\nLast year, we thought it would be her last birthday.\n\nShe got very sick, and she even told us she was ready to meet the Lord. But this year, she started asking about the days leading up to her birthday, counting them down. Its a blessing to spend another birthday with her.\n\nMarshlands sister, Berit Bradfield, and family friend Alet Steenkamp expressed gratitude for every moment spent with Tannie Cora.\n\nWe are thankful to the Lord for sparing her another year, Marshland said. There are good and bad days, but today, were just happy to be with her. Even when shes not as talkative, you can still feel her presence.\n\nLife Lessons from Tannie Cora include, You can make life very beautiful just by having a united family; Learn how to get along with people; It takes a lot of energy and patience to be a parent; Dont assume that another person is a fool; being late is an insult and disrespectful to those waiting for you; friends are very important and never forget your sense of humour.\n\n",
