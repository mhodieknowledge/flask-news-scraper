            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has defended its monetary policy and the new Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency framework in response to criticism from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nThe IMFs August 2025 review of Zimbabwes economic performance praised the RBZs tight monetary policy for stabilising the ZiG and controlling inflation, but called for an overhaul of the countrys foreign exchange (FX) management system.\n\nThe IMF recommended reducing the RBZs involvement in the FX market, specifically lowering the mandatory 30% export surrender requirement and transitioning to a more market-driven approach. It also suggested simplifying the Zimbabwean dollars exchange rate system, which it believes is inconsistent with a floating rate.\n\nHowever, the RBZ disagreed, asserting that its current approach provides essential flexibility for stabilizing the currency and strengthening reserves. The central bank emphasized that its involvement in the FX market is necessary to maintain exchange rate stability and questioned the IMFs recommendation to reduce its role.\n\nOn broader monetary policy, the IMF proposed phasing out Non-Negotiable Certificates of Deposit (NNCDs) and replacing them with tradable securities to improve liquidity management. The RBZ responded by outlining plans to reduce reliance on direct monetary tools and improve policy transmission, including the introduction of a Term Deposit Facility.\n\nAdditionally, the RBZ rejected IMF claims about exchange rate restrictions, stating that recent reforms have removed all formal restrictions and any remaining measures are internal procedures by financial institutions, not government-imposed.\n\nDespite the disagreements, the RBZ expressed openness to future adjustments, such as enhancing the FX market with greater transparency and exploring IMF technical assistance.\n\nThe central bank also reaffirmed its commitment to price stability and long-term reforms, with plans to transition to a mono-currency system by 2030.\n\n",

Attendees said that children as young as 13-years-old are being trapped in cycles of drug abuse, early marriages, and social instability  problems they believe are being worsened by the lack of mental health support.Speakers strongly condemned what they described as rampant corruption at the highest levels of government. Several participants accused President Emmerson Mnangagwa and members of his inner circle of enriching themselves while ordinary citizens suffer.The brain drain we are witnessing is not by choice, said Patson Muzuwa, one of the organisers.It is forced by the mismanagement and greed of a few elites who have destroyed the nations future.Attendees also reflected on the freedom of being able to gather and speak openly in the UK, contrasting it with the repression faced in Zimbabwe. Many expressed relief at having the space to criticise the regime without fear of police harassment.However, participants acknowledged the risks of their activism, warning that under the Patriotic Act of 2023, those who openly criticise the government abroad could face arrest and persecution if they return home.The meeting included contributions from Nobukhosi Dube, Melbar Dick, Luckmore Masanzu, Martha Mutima, Xoliso Sithole, Desire Kunaka and Blessing Tariro Makeyi. Opposition Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) UK executive member Hatirarame Jenatry Muranganwa (Chihota) and Prince Justin Chihurani also participated.
