            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFormer leader of the Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), Nelson Chamisa, has revealed that his departure from both the CCC and the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), was a calculated move aimed at frustrating President Emmerson Mnangagwa, whom he accuses of orchestrating a takeover of the opposition parties.\n\nChamisa resigned as leader of the CCC in January last year, citing the hijacking of his party by Mnangagwa as punishment for his refusal to accept the results of the chaotic August 2023 general elections.\n\nThe fallout from the elections saw Sengezo Tshabangu emerge, seemingly from nowhere, claiming to be the interim Secretary General of the CCC.\n\nTshabangus stated aim was to restore order within the opposition by addressing alleged irregularities in the candidate selection process leading up to the 2023 elections.\n\nTshabangu subsequently initiated a widespread recall of elected representatives, claiming that certain candidates had been improperly selected.\n\nThis led to the unprecedented recall of over 40 MPs and councillors, effectively handing Zanu-PF back the two-thirds parliamentary majority it had failed to secure during the harmonised elections.\n\nChamisas attempts to prevent these recalls, including written appeals to the then Local Government Minister July Moyo and Speaker of the National Assembly Jacob Mudenda, proved futile. The courts upheld the recalls, leaving Chamisa with no option but to step aside.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Thursday, Chamisa confirmed that his decision to leave the CCC was motivated by a desire to spite Mnangagwa.\n\nThe best decision I ever made in my leadership journey was to walk away from MDC & CCC. You will thank me later. I had to break the cycle of going in circles. And that was my best way to teach ED a lesson!, Chamisa declared.\n\nThis was not Chamisas first departure from a major political entity. He had previously walked away from the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) after a Supreme Court ruling questioned the legitimacy of his assumption of the party leadership following the death of Morgan Tsvangirai.\n\n",
