            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has ordered a private security guard and his employer, Javelin Trading (Pvt) Ltd, to pay nearly US$49,000 in damages to a Nyabira police officer and farmer, who was left permanently disabled after being shot in the back during a farm patrol.\n\nJustice Gladys Mhuri ruled that guard Casten Suwedi acted negligently when he opened fire on Calisto Mujera at Gwebi South Farm on April 26, 2020, leaving him partially paralysed. The court found Javelin Trading, which employed and armed Suwedi, vicariously liable.The second defendant did not shout at the person to stop. He aimed at the vehicle without ascertaining whether there were any people there. A reasonable person exercising due care would have foreseen that aiming at the motor vehicle he was likely to hit a person, Justice Mhuri said.I find, therefore, that the second defendant was negligent and his negligence caused the plaintiff to sustain the injuries which left him disabled.Mujera had sued for US$331,590 in special and general damages, claiming loss of income, farming produce, medical bills and future expenses.The court, however, trimmed the award to US$48,920.66, covering verified medical, transport, and farm losses, as well as compensation for pain, suffering and loss of amenities.General damages are not a penalty but compensation, Justice Mhuri stressed.The award is designed to compensate the victim and not to punish the wrongdoer.According to testimony, Mujera was driving with his son on the evening of April 26, 2020, when he stopped near Javelin Farm after noticing suspicious movements. As he disembarked to inspect his overheating car, Suwedi, who was on patrol, shone a torch from the maize field and fired a shot, hitting Mujera in the back.I shouted that I was a police officer, Mujera testified, adding that no warning shot was given.All I saw was a light and then I heard a bang.The bullet left shrapnel lodged in his spine, causing permanent damage to his lower body. He spent weeks at Parirenyatwa Hospital and months at Chikurubi Police Hospital, undergoing treatment and physiotherapy. Medical reports confirmed he will live with chronic pain, weakness and loss of function in his lower limbs.Mujera told the court the injuries destroyed his farming business, cost him his formal employment, and left him humiliated after local media reports suggested he had been shot while stealing maize. He and his son were later acquitted of theft charges in the Norton Magistrates Court.Suwedi argued that he had caught Mujera and others harvesting maize under cover of night and claimed he fired only after giving a warning. But the judge dismissed his version, describing him as not a truthful witness who gave conflicting accounts of the shooting.Javelin Trading, which provided Suwedi with a firearm despite his lack of formal weapons training, chose not to lead any evidence in its defence. The court held it responsible as the employer.In the circumstances, first defendant is liable for the second defendants actions and the resultant injuries suffered by plaintiff, Mhuri ruled.The court granted Mujera US$33,920.66 in special damages, including medical and transport costs and farm income losses, US$10,000 for pain, suffering, and permanent disablement, US$5,000 for loss of amenities, including the inability to perform normal family and social functions.In total, US$48,920.66 is to be paid jointly by Javelin Trading and Suwedi, with one paying absolving the other.\n\nJustice Gladys Mhuri ruled that guard Casten Suwedi acted negligently when he opened fire on Calisto Mujera at Gwebi South Farm on April 26, 2020, leaving him partially paralysed.

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nPRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa made a constitutional blunder in reshuffling the Zanu PF Politburo, describing the redeployments as invalid, a top lawyer has said.\n\nMnangagwa rung changes to his partys supreme organ, the Politburo, with Obert Mpofu being demoted to the Secretary for Information and Communication from the influential post of Secretary-General.\n\nIn reshuffling the Politburo, Mnangagwa cited Article 9, sections 65 and 67 of the Zanu PFs Constitution, which, according to renowned lawyer Thabani Mpofu, does not give him the power to reassign.\n\nThe letter from Chris Mutsvangwa purporting to announce changes to the Zanu PF Politburo is invalid. It claims the decision to relieve Obert Mpofu of his office as Zanu PF Secretary-General was taken under Article 9, sections 65 and 67.\n\nArticle 9 concerns Politburo functions generally and does not confer authority for the First Secretary to reassign office-holders. Section 65 addresses the functions of the Secretary for Economic Development and Empowerment; section 67 addresses the functions of the Secretary for Healthcare of the Child and the Elderley.\n\nNeither provision authorises the personnel change Mutsvangwa communicates. For that reason, the letter does not effect a lawful change of office, said Mpofu in post on X.\n\nThe Politburo reshuffle was viewed by political observers as a move to consolidate power by President Mnangagwa ahead of the partys conference scheduled for Mutare next month.\n\nZanu PF is torn into two factions, one backing Mnangagwa to rule beyond the constitutionally mandated two terms, with the other supporting Constantino Chiwenga to succeed him.\n\nMpofu further said Mnangagwa might have erred in instituting his sweeping reassignments.\n\nNothing in the Zanu PF Constitution vests the First Secretary with the unilateral power to make the reassignments announced. Section 54 is clear on this as it sets out the full remit of his powers.\n\nIn fact, in terms of section 49 the power to appoint heads is exercised during Congress and not anytime thereafter. A power not enshrined in the Constitution cannot lawfully be exercised.\n\nAccordingly, if the position is maintained that the First Secretary lacks authority to reassign Mpofu et al, and that position is not accepted, a dispute arises mandating resolution. In the meantime, its back to original settings, said Mpofu.\n\n",

For almost two decades, it sparked conversations in homes, workplaces and social media spaces, providing entertainment that felt authentically local.\n\nIt gave local actors, writers, directors, and production teams a platform to showcase their talents while telling South African stories.\n\nHelga Palmer, group head of local programming and strategy at eMedia, captured the bittersweet nature of this farewell:We are proud of what Scandal! has achieved, not only as a top-rated television property but also as a vital part of South Africas cultural landscape.\n\nWe thank the entire production team, the cast past and present, and our loyal viewers for making this journey extraordinary.\n\ne.tv has extended heartfelt gratitude to Ochre Media, the production company that brought Scandal! to life throughout its run.\n\nStan Joseph, executive producer at Ochre Moving Pictures, reflected on what the series has meant to everyone involved:Producing Scandal! has been an incredible journey and a true labour of love. For close to twenty years, our writers, directors, actors and crew have poured their hearts into bringing authentic South African stories to life.\n\nJoseph continued: We are deeply grateful to e.tv for their trust and to our audiences for their unwavering support. While it is bittersweet to say goodbye, we are proud of the legacy that Scandal! leaves behind.\n\nScandal! will continue to air until the end of June 2026, giving viewers time to process this goodbye while ensuring the series receives the send-off it deserves.\n\nFor fans, this means they have a few more months to savour every episode, every plot twist, every character moment.\n\n",
