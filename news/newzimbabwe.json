At first, I was involved in playing games, but all of a sudden I was banished from the first team, I was made to train with the reserves and kicked out of the changing room as well.\n\nIt was a horrible experience, but I will say it helped me to grow, relieved Benyu.\n\nAfter leaving Celtic, Benyu has been nomadic from one club to another, at the same time struggling to adjust.\n\nThe Ipswich academy product had been without a club since July last year, only to resurface at CAPS United.\n\nThe treatment he was given by Rogers at Celtic, Benyu says,was a nightmare he is still trying to recover from.\n\nFor all these years, I have been asking myself the question why he did that to me.\n\nI was not given a reason, and I remember several times I went to his (Rogers) office asking why I was being treated as if I was not liked in the building.\n\nI was ignored all the time I made those efforts, so in the end I accepted and moved on.\n\nUntil now, I always think about it, asking myself what I really did wrong, and I cant think of anything because this is the same team that lured me there at first, said Benyu.\n\nWith five national team caps to his name, Benyu is hoping that he can come back to the local top-flight to recover and regain form.\n\n",

During this time, Zanu PF militant youths and war veterans inflicted torture, abductions, and all manner of human rights violations to then MDC supporters.\n\nIn a move that some will undoubtedly view with cynicism, Geza, as one of the war veterans who participated in these heinous crimes with impunity, has now appealed for forgiveness from the opposition community for his past sins, committed alongside his comrades.\n\nGeza attributed his past actions to the fog of war and acknowledged that human rights violations, corruption, and economic mismanagement have led the younger generation to scorn those who fought in the liberation war.\n\nWe are sorry as war veterans. We have let you down. We were being used to assault members of the opposition because we were blinded, he confessed.\n\nGeza concluded: We are now a laughing stock. Young people in this country are telling us as war veterans to return the country in the hands of former colonists. This is being caused by these criminals that we are not reprimanding.\n\nIt has become something of a well-worn trope for Zanu PF outcasts to apologise to the opposition the moment they fall out of favour within their own party.\n\n",

Security personnel launched an investigation, reviewing passenger manifests and conducting physical checks.\n\nIt was discovered that the Ethiopian Airlines manifest had been falsified to misrepresent the Ethiopians as Russians, Turks, and Indians.\n\nFurther checks with National Handling Services revealed another doctored manifest, which listed the Ethiopians as Malawians.\n\nUpon arrival in Eswatini, authorities conducted a physical inspection of Eswatini Airlines flight RN401 and found that the 23 Ethiopians lacked proper transit visas.\n\nThe Ethiopians were arrested, convicted on March 20, 2025, and fined US$100 each or sentenced to three months imprisonment. This development led to a deeper investigation, which implicated the eight airport employees in the smuggling operation.\n\n",

Notably, the tight Monetary Policy stance by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) contains interventions aimed at establishing price stability and improving the efficiency of foreign exchange markets. This includes the launch of the new currency, ZWG, in April 2025 leading to a strategic reduction in money supply growth, and a focus on strengthening foreign currency reserves, he said.\n\nNyazema said property-wise, CBZH is providing services throughout the real estate value chain under the Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), where they are directly participating in the creation of housing stock for sale.\n\nThe institution is currently implementing projects like the Northgate in Harare, Athelney in Ruwa and Gateway City in Mutare, currently on sale, backed by US$ denominated mortgages for property purchase, building finance and property.\n\nThe top banker added that CBZ Holdings has since established a dedicated unit within our organization focused exclusively on serving the diaspora market, staffed with a committed team of relationship managers ready to extend support round the clock.\n\nIndeed, our journey commenced last year in the UK, serving as a significant eye-opener and unlocking numerous opportunities.

The remaining three years will also be set aside on condition that the convicts restitute the bank the full amount of US$34,000 they stole by June 30, 2025.\n\n",
