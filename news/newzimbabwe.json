There may be good reasons why the professors and lecturers are striking, but we cannot say that every strike that happens somewhere is a condemnation of the government.\n\nThere is nothing untoward about lecturers or any other Zimbabwean saying, I am not happy with what my employer is doing. It is not a political issue; it is an employer-employee relationship, said Mutsvangwa.\n\nThe Association of University Teachers, which is campaigning for a salary increase, has been met with silence from UZ.\n\nUZ responded heavy-handedly, suspending five of the striking lecturers, with reports indicating that newly recruited adjunct teachers will earn US$3 per hour.\n\nMutsvangwa said a solution must be found to avert further chaos at UZ.\n\nNo, it is an expression of the democratic nature of Zimbabwean society. There is nothing wrong with striking, but hopefully, they will sit down together and assess each others grievances and demands.\n\nThere is no way we can be permanently without lecturers at such an important institution as the University of Zimbabwe. I am sure something good will come out of it, said Mutsvangwa.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nNgg wa Thiongo, who has died aged 87,was a titan of modern African literature  a storyteller who refused to be bound by jail, exile and illness.\n\nHis work spanned roughly six decades, primarily documenting the transformation of his country  Kenya  from a colonial subject to a democracy.\n\nNgg was tipped to win the Nobel Prize for Literature countless times, leaving fans dismayed each time the medal slipped through his fingers.\n\nHe will be remembered not only as a Nobel-worthy writer, but also as a fierce proponent of literature written in native African languages.\n\nNgg was born James Thiongo Ngg in 1938, when Kenya was under British colonial rule. He grew up in the town of Limuru among a large family of low-income agricultural workers.\n\nHis parents scrimped and saved to pay for his tuition at Alliance, a boarding school run by British missionaries.\n\nIn aninterview, Ngg recalled returning home from Alliance at the end of term to find his entire village had been razed by the colonial authorities.\n\nHis family members were among the hundreds and thousands forced to live in detention camps during a crackdown on the Mau Mau, a movement of independence fighters.\n\nThe Mau Mau uprising, which lasted from 1952 to 1960, touched Nggs life in numerous, devastating ways.\n\nIn one of the most crushing, Nggs brother, Gitogo, was fatally shot in the back for refusing to comply with a British soldiers command.\n\nGitogo had not heard the command because he was deaf.\n\nIn 1959, as the British struggled to maintain their grip on Kenya, Ngg left to study in Uganda. He enrolled at Makerere University, which remains one of Africas most prestigious universities.\n\nDuring a writers conference at Makerere, Ngg shared the manuscript for his debut novel with revered Nigerian author Chinua Achebe.\n\nAchebe forwarded the manuscript to his publisher in the UK and the book, named Weep Not, Child, was released to critical acclaim in 1964. It was the first major English-language novel to be written by an East African.\n\nNgg swiftly followed up with two more popular novels, A Grain of Wheat and The River Between. In 1972, the UKs Times newspaper said Ngg, then aged 33, was accepted as one of Africas outstanding contemporary writers.\n\nThen came 1977  a period that marked a huge change in Nggs life and career. For starters, this was the year he became Ngg wa Thiongo and shed his birth name, James. Ngg made the change as he wanted a name free of colonial influence.\n\nHe also dropped English as the primary language for his literature and vowed to only write in his mother tongue, Kikuyu.\n\nHe published his last English language novel, Petals of Blood, in 1977.\n\nNggs previous books had been critical of the colonial state, but Petals of Blood attacked the new leaders of independent Kenya, portraying them as an elite class who had betrayed ordinary Kenyans.\n\nNgg didnt stop there. The same year, he co-wrote the play Ngaahika Ndeenda (I Will Marry When I Want), which was a searing look at Kenyas class struggle.\n\nIts theatre run was shut down by the government of then President Jomo Kenyatta and Ngg was locked up in a maximum security jail for a year without trial.\n\nIt was a fruitful 12 months, however  as Ngg wrote his first Kikuyu novel, Devil on the Cross, while in prison. It is said he used toilet paper to write the entire book, as he did not have access to a notebook.\n\nNgg was released after Daniel arap Moi replaced Mr Kenyatta as president.\n\nNgg said that four years later, while in London for a book launch,he learnt there was a plot to kill himon his return to Kenya.\n\nNgg began self-imposed exile in the UK and then the US. He did not return to Kenya for 22 years.\n\nWhen he finally did return, he received a heros welcome  thousands of Kenyans turned out to greet him.\n\nBut the homecoming was marred when assailants broke into Nggs apartment, brutally attacking the author and raping his wife.\n\nNgginsisted the assault was political.\n\nHe returned to the US, where he had held professorships at universities including Yale, New York and California Irvine.\n\nIn academia and beyond, Ngg became known as one of the foremost advocates of literature written in African languages.\n\nThroughout his career  and to this day  African literature was dominated by books written in English or French, official languages in most countries on the continent.\n\nWhat is the difference between a politician who says Africa cannot do without imperialism and the writer who says Africa cannot do without European languages? Ngg asked in a seminal, fiery essay collection, named Decolonising the Mind.\n\nIn one section, Ngg called out Chinua Achebe  the author who helped to launch his career  for writing in English. Their friendship soured as a result.\n\nAway from his literary career, Ngg was married  and divorced  twice. He had nine children, four of whom are published authors.\n\nMy own family has become one of my literary rivals, Ngg joked in a 2020LA Times interview.\n\nHis son, Mukoma wa Ngg, has alleged that his mother was physically abused by Ngg wa Thiongo.\n\nSome of my earliest memories are me going to visit her at my grandmothers where she would seek refuge, his son wrote in a social media post, which Ngg wa Thiongo did not respond to.\n\nLater in his life, Nggs health deteriorated. He had triple heart bypass surgery in 2019 and began to struggle with kidney failure. In 1995, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer and given three months to live.\n\nNgg recovered, however, adding cancer to the lengthy list of struggles he had overcome.\n\nBut now one of African literatures guiding lights  as Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie once called him  is gone, leaving the world of words a little darker.\n\n",

Equally, I wish a speedy recovery to all those nursing injuries from the incident. I have since directed the responsible arms of my Government to declare this traffic accident a national disaster.\n\nThis crucial legal step paves the way for Government to move in and take all-round responsibility for the interment of all those who perished the accident, and for support to those hospitalised. May all the bereaved and other affected families find comfort and a solace in that our Nation joins and mourns with them in this hour of deep grief and pain, said Mnangagwa.\n\nHe urged the public to support law enforcement in addressing reckless driving.\n\nThe deadly incident adds yet another grim statistic to the needless toll which reckless driving levies on our people and our Nation. While I am pleased that the Zimbabwe Republic Police is moving speedily towards a full deployment of high-end technologies for traffic management, and for curbing waywardness on our roads, more still has to be done to arrest the ever-spiralling fatalities we face as a Nation.\n\nThe duty for safe traffic conduct squarely falls on all road users, while the responsibility to call out reckless road-users includes the general public who should support our law enforcement agencies to tame what in essence has become a traffic jungle, added Mnangagwa.\n\n",

Mhlanga, a first-year law student, and another University of Zimbabwe Economics student were denied the opportunity to sit for their examinations while in custody, whilst inmates experienced inhumane living conditions, mostly due to overcrowding.\n\nPrison cells designed for 35 inmates were reportedly holding more than 80, leading to unsanitary and degrading living conditions.\n\nSeveral detainees raised allegations of police abuse during their arrests, including physical violence and theft of personal belongings.\n\nThe commission revealed there were 66 irregular migrants of different nationalities whose detention was in violation of their rights, as they were not facing any criminal charges and were not awaiting trial.\n\nZHRC urged relevant authorities to take immediate action to prioritise urgent bail applications, conduct thorough investigations into allegations of police misconduct and ensure accountability for any abuses.\n\nThe Commission called for improved prison conditions, reduced crowds, restoration ofcommunication facilities, and access to adequate medical care for all detainees.\n\nPrison officers were urged to desist from imprisoning irregular migrants whose issues should be handled without resorting to indefinite detention.\n\nInmates were advised to report any complaints to the Officer In Charge, who indicated that he was ready to receive reports of assaults by prison officers and bullying by fellow inmates.\n\n",

It would have been a release for us not to make that visit because we are aware that Parliament is where it started. Parliament is where the Constitution was made and where that provision, Section 210 of the Constitution, was created, which enables us as the Commission to investigate cases of misconduct or violations of the Constitution by members of the security services, that is the Army, the CIO, the prison service and the police.\n\nIts mainly cases of assaults by police officers and allegations of abuse of our office, and those are the main cases, and also delays in handling of our cases when reports are made to the police about violations,Chinamora said.\n\nChinamora also highlighted that the Commission had received tremendous support from the President in the form of offices being sequenced to it from the Office of the President and Cabinet and support from the Public Service Commission (PSC).\n\nWe are also informing the Speaker that we have made a draft of the regulations which set out the procedure for receiving complaints, investigating complaints and ending the hearings when they do come to us. So, we are telling them that we did our own draft as a Commission, and we presented it to the Attorney General, and the drafters are now working on it, so that the draft crystallises into a statutory instrument.\n\nWe also got support from the Speaker himself, with very invaluable suggestions that we have a retreat with senior officers for the top brass of the Security Services, so that we build that trust which is required, and that will help us in terms of preventing the actual making of complaints if the top brass knows how to avoid cases of misconduct, how to avoid mistakes which generate the mistakes.\n\n",
