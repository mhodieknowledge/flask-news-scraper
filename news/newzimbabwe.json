Dual currency trading created imbalances, with significant ZWG cash holdings proving difficult to utilise, as most suppliers required settlement in US$, the company said.\n\nThe sugar processor said, given the obtaining circumstances, the company was unable to generate sufficient quantities through normal trade.\n\nThe reduction in the foreign currency retention threshold from 75% to 70% towards the year-end is expected to further reduce the companys US$ export inflows in the year ahead, constraining funding for essential raw material imports and capital expenditure, HVEL said.\n\nDuring the period, operating profit improved significantly to US$7,9 million, reflecting the reversal of prior year CPI and currency effects embedded in cost of sales and the movement in the fair value of biological assets and administration expenses.\n\nProfit for the year declined by 45% to US$13.4 million, mainly due to the inclusion of a non-monetary gain in the prior year relating to the hyperinflationary restatement process.\n\nThe Company remains focused on advancing its strategic growth plans, with priorities centred on increasing sugar production, expanding the revenue portfolio, containing costs and generating positive cash flows.\n\nHowever, significant challenges persist in the form of water availability, electricity supply interruptions, and a complex operating environment, the company added.\n\n",

She was detained and spent Tuesday night in police holding cells awaiting court appearance this Wednesday.\n\nIn a statement, the Zimbabwe Union of Journalists (ZUJ) condemned the arrest, describing it as the criminalisation of journalism.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Union of Journalists (ZUJ) condemns strongly the arrest and detention of Faith Zaba, Zimbabwe Independent Editor by the Zimbabwe Republic Police.\n\nZaba was arrested over a satirical Muckraker column published last Friday in the Zimbabwe Independent, which authorities claim undermined the authority of the President.\n\nAs a Union, we are deeply disturbed by the criminalisation of journalism over editorial content that falls squarely within the boundaries of journalistic expression and satire. Satirical commentary, whether critical or humorous, is protected speech and should not be criminalised, said ZUJ.\n\nWhat makes this incident more concerning is that it comes in the wake of the recently launched Media Policy by His Excellency President Emmerson Mnangagwa, a policy which pledges to promote an open, tolerant, and free media environment.\n\nZabas arrest and treatment runs counter to the spirit and commitments of this policy, and risk undermining confidence in the governments professed reform agenda.\n\nZUJ is also alarmed by reports that Zaba, who is suffering from a serious illness, was detained overnight despite medical confirmation of her condition.This raises grave concerns about her health, safety, and the proportionality of the actions taken by law enforcement.\n\nZUJ called for the immediate and unconditional release of Zaba.\n\nWe therefore demand the immediate and unconditional release of Faith Zaba. As ZUJ, we reaffirm our unwavering commitment to defending media freedom and protecting the rights of journalists.\n\nWe stand with Zaba and with every journalist in Zimbabwe who works fearlessly to inform the public and uphold the principles of truth, justice, and objectivity, ZUJ added.\n\n",

Zambia and Zimbabwe are among the hardest hit countries, facing frequent power outages due to reduced water levels in Lake Kariba, which have caused a 25% drop in hydroelectric output.\n\nParticipants are expected to review the progress of the Mission 300 initiative, a project backed by the World Bank and African Development Bank that aims to expand energy access to 600 million people in the region by 2030, with the first target being 300 million.\n\nThe agenda also includes discussions on developing the petroleum and gas sectors, as well as adopting emerging technologies such as green hydrogen and smart grids. The Ministers will consider recommendations from a recent regional dialogue on ensuring a just transition to sustainable energy in Southern Africa.\n\nOn the water front, the meeting will evaluate advances in transboundary water management projects, led by River Basin Organisations and other shared institutions, including groundwater and livelihood support programmes.\n\nProfessor Obert Jiri, Permanent Secretary in Zimbabwes Ministry of Lands, Agriculture and Water Development and Chair of the water officials committee, highlighted the critical link between energy and water resources.\n\nSolar power and energy recovered from landfill gases demonstrate the close relationship between water and energy, he said. Managing water resources effectively is vital, not just for energy generation but also as a response to climate change. A small rise in temperature can significantly reduce water availability in our region, affecting agriculture and livelihoods.\n\nHe added that this meeting is crucial for exploring ways to improve water access for irrigation and energy production, both of which are essential for the regions development.\n\n",
