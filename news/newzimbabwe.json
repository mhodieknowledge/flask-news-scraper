            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE 2025 tobacco selling season kicked off in Harare, Wednesday, with the first bale selling at US$4,65, indicating improved golden leaf yields.\n\nSpeaking to stakeholders at the official opening of the selling season, the Tobacco Industry Marketing Boards (TIMB) chairman, Patrick Davenish said this season 32 buyers and 43 contractors are buying from 56 selling points across Zimbabwe.\n\nHe reiterated TIMBscommitment to ensuring that all tobacco growers have fair and convenient market access, and we are continuously engaging stakeholders to explore ways to improve accessibility\n\nThe debut price at US$4,65 is quite higher than last years US$4,35 in a development signifying better times for the golden leafs farmers.\n\nThe Board has also approved decentralized contract sales to be conducted at 56 selling points and 7 centers.Concerning payment modalities, the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) advised that the foreign currency retention for tobacco is 70% in line with the retention level for other market players. This means that 30% will be paid in local currency, said Davenish.\n\nHowever, farmers who spoke to NewZimbabwe.com expressed grave concerns over the RBZ policy directive to retain 30% of US$ earnings for the farmers and pay the equivalent at the official exchange rate.\n\nAll the implements are priced strictly in US. We owe some product suppliers who expect payment in foreign currency, and yet the central bank will withhold 30% of our US$ earnings. This will even impinge our planning modalities for the coming season, said one farmer on the condition of anonymity.\n\nAcknowledging the overwhelming concerns on foreign currency retention thresholds, Davenish committed to continuously engage the RBZ over the matter.\n\nAs a Board, we will continue to lobby that the RBZ hears the cries of tobacco growers. We value them because they are our primary stakeholders, and their viability is at the epicenter of what we do, he said.\n\nDavenish called on farmers to place environmental sustainability at the heart of their operations by adopting environmentally responsible practices throughout the value chain.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nMOVEMENT for Democratic Change (MDC-T) president Douglas Mwonzora is seething with anger after the High Court nullified the opposition partys 2022 ordinary congress.\n\nMwonzora says Zanu PF was behind the ruling in order to pacify his calls for Zimbabweans to resist President Emmerson Mnangagwas 2030 agenda to extend his incumbency beyond the constitutionally permissible two terms that expire in 2028.\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Hapias Zhou last week ordered Mwonzora to resign and pave way for a fresh congress within six months due to irregularities in the 2022 MDC-T Extraordinary Congress that catapulted him to the helm of the party.\n\nResponding to the ruling, Mwonzora took aim at Zanu PFs Mnangagwa and his 2030 agenda proponents.\n\nI want to say we are going to attenuate our fight against the 2030 agenda. We will never allow anybody to intimidate us against fighting the 2030 agenda.\n\nSo, if there is a faction within Zanu PF which has a hand in this judgment, we say tough luck to you. We are going to intensify our fight against the 2030 agenda. We will never allow the emasculation of our Constitution, we will never allow being bullied against defending our Constitution, charged Mwonzora.\n\nHe said his party was a stakeholder of the 2013 Constitution of Zimbabwe, having participated in its drafting while Zimbabweans owned it after giving their opinions during the consultative process and referendum.\n\nThe people of Zimbabwe are stakeholders, they spoke during the outreach programme about what they wanted in the Constitution. They spoke during the referendum on what they wanted in this Constitution. What they said they wanted in this Constitution was that a President must run the country for a maximum of 10 years, after which they must go home.\n\nWe are saying, President Mnangagwa, after the expiry of your term in 2028, go home, and nothing is going to intimidate us from this path, said Mwonzora.\n\nMwonzora claimed MDC-T had consummated a coalition with other progressive forces, including political parties, the church, civil society, and war veterans to push back against Mnangagwas ambitious plan to be life president.\n\nTurning to the courts ruling that MDC-T must hold fresh polls to choose new leaders, Mwonzora said he was ready to defend his positionas leaderthrough the ballot.\n\nwhen the time comes, we will hold congress and l, as president of the MDC-T am willing to face anyone in a congress. I am willing to face Mudzuri, anybody, in congress, and we all know what the outcome of the congress will be. We know they will be defeated, Zanu PF knows that they will be defeated, Mwonzora added.\n\nAt the 2020 extraordinary congress, Mwonzora annihilated Thokozani Khupe, Elias Mudzuri and Morgen Komichi, who were also vying for the MDC-T presidency. Before vote counting could start, Khupe and Komichi walked out, accusing Mwonzoras camp of using violence and a fraudulent voters roll. Mudzuri also left the congress shortly after.\n\nDespite the protests, voting continued into the night, and Mwonzora was declared the opposition president with 883 votes, Khupe got 118 votes, Mudzuri scrapped 14, and Komichi a paltry 9 votes.\n\nOn December 18, 2022, the MDC-T held an ordinary congress where the party endorsed Mwonzora as its sole presidential candidate for the 2023 general elections. The congress also confirmed Chief Ndlovu as the first vice president and Paurina Mpariwa as the second vice president, both of whom were unopposed.\n\nMudzuri and three other applicants later filed a case in the High Court, challenging the validity of the 2020 congress and seeking an order for a fresh congress.\n\nLast Friday, February 28, 2025, Justice Zhou handed a surprise ruling declaring that the 2022 congress was null and void arguing that it fell short of meeting requirements of the MDC-T Constitution.\n\nThe purported National Congress held in December 2022 by the second respondent as the National Congress of the first respondent be and is hereby declared null and void for noncompliance with the first respondents Constitution, part of the ruling reads.\n\nThe court ordered that a new national congress be held within six months, under an independent election commission as stipulated in the MDC-T Constitution.\n\n",

Politically, instead of focusing on bread-and-butter issues, we are caught up in distractions such as the Third term conversations. Something that has brought with it divisions and unnecessary diversions from the things that do matter.\n\nEconomically, we are not faring well. Businesses are closing, and many people are losing their jobs. The few who are still lucky to be working are burdened under the regime of taxes.\n\nCorruption is rampant and seems tobe out of control. At the rate at which it is taking place, cutting through various sectors, the nation isdoomed. One wonders why the corrupt seemuncensoredand even rewarded whilsthemorrhagingthe nation, the letter reads.\n\nThe bishops criticized economic policies for favoring the elite while most Zimbabweans struggle with poverty.\n\nIt must be said that in our society there is an ever-widening gap between the poor and the rich.\n\nFew individuals seem to be benefiting from the wealth of the nation. We would like to remind our people that Poverty in the world today is not simply a misfortune, bad luck or inevitable -the result of laziness or ignorance or a lack of development. Poverty in the world today is the direct result of political and economic policies of governments, political parties, and big business.\n\n",

Currently, most workers in our sector and Zimbabwe in general are losing their jobs way before the retirement age, he said.\n\nThe CWUZ leader said that due to the pressing situation and the rampant job cuts, very few of those who lose their jobs will manage to secure new employment, with some not even getting a job again until they surpass retirement age.\n\nIt is therefore against this background that we implore relevant authorities to urgently compel NSSA to consider processing payouts earlier rather than waiting for one to reach the retirement age. This will go a long way to assist the affected workers to raise funds and venture into other self-sustaining projects, he said.\n\nChikwekwete said the situation bedevilling axed workers is very dire with risks of exposing such workers to chronic and mental health illnesses.\n\nNSSAs intervention by processing timely payments will go a long way to alleviate such kinds of negative impacts, he added.\n\n",

It is unfortunate that they are in a foreign land as we speak. You look at Walter Mzembihe is harmless. He is pure. If they can allow them back into their country, it will be a blessing for your nation. There is nothing wrong with that. No one is powerful besides the power that you give them, said Makandiwa.\n\nWhen Robert Mugabe was deposed, Mzembi and Kasukuwere were brought before the courts, accused of corruption during their time in the previous cabinet. They, however, dismissed the allegations as a political witch hunt.\n\nMakandiwa claimed that he had warned Mugabe during his presidency that he would be deposed and that Mnangagwa would succeed him.\n\nThe cleric further urged Zimbabweans living abroad, who have sought greener pastures due to the countrys economic challenges, to return home.\n\nZimbabwe is full of blessings. Bring your children who are in the diaspora. They are blessings that have left, Makandiwa added.\n\nMakandiwa is no stranger to dabbling in the countrys politics.

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nSCOTTLAND coach Tonderai Ndiraya is not naive to the task that the moneyed side faces in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League (PSL).\n\nThe newly promoted team had an underwhelming debut in the top flight last Friday, securing a last-minute win through an own goal by Triangle defender Blessing Chiota.\n\nWhile there were huge expectations on Scottland to make light work of Triangle, they found the going tough despite being bolstered by expensive signings.\n\nThe team was disjointed, with a clear lack of cohesion from the galaxy of stars. In comparison, Triangle fielded veteran players who are past their prime, such as Ali Sadiki and Thabani Kamusoko, but managed to frustrate the Mabvuku side.\n\nNdiraya pleaded for more time for Scottland to gel and play as a unit in the PSL after a busy signing spree.\n\nDespite having a galaxy of stars in our team, I think it is important to understand that football is a process. You may buy whoever you want from the market, but at the end, the players have to understand each other and play as a team in the long run.\n\nSo that it is a process. It does not happen in one day. With more games, the team will start to play as a team. At the moment, we are not a team yet, said Ndiraya.\n\nOn Friday, Ndiraya fielded last years Soccer Stars of the Year finalists, Lynoth Chikuhwa, Walter Musona, and Tymon Machope. Khama Billiat was omitted due to injury.\n\nThe quartet scored a combined 51 goals last season. Such is the quality of the arsenal that Ndiraya has at his disposal.\n\nIt is the signings that have made Scottland favourites to clinch the 2025 PSL title among bookmakers.\n\nNdiraya said there is still a long way to go before his team starts to deliver statement performances.\n\nWith more time on the pitch, at training we will come good. We will start to play as a team and be where we are expected to play. We are building a team. Putting a galaxy of players together is one thing, and making them play as a team is another.\n\nIt is a process, and we are very patient. Hopefully, after a few games, we can then start to play the way we want and the way that everyone will understand. The expectation is for the team to win 5-0. But football is not like that; you will have to work for it, he said.\n\nScottland face CAPS United on Sunday at Rufaro in a potentially exciting match.\n\n",
