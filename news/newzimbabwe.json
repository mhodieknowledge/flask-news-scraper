It is politics delaying the opening of these borders, which in our opinion is inevitable.Government has the tendency to inflate growth estimates and the market warned several months ago that they were significantly overestimating the maize crop.Current supply is extremely tight and millers are already dipping into reserves. If borders are not opened within the next few weeks, millers could struggle to meet consumer maize meal demand.Whereas Pienaar estimates Zimbabwe needs an extra 1.1 million tonnes, the US Foreign Agricultural Services believes current supply will fall short by around 700,000 tonnes despite a notable increase in production.The 2024/25 season produced an estimated 1.3 million tonnes against a national demand of two million tonnes.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has cleared the way for Reverend Johannes Nehanda, a senior official in the Apostolic Faith Mission (AFM) in Zimbabwe, to testify in a bitter property dispute linked to the churchs long-running leadership feud.\n\nThe case stems from the deep divisions that split AFM in Zimbabwe in 2018, when rival factions clashed over control of the churchs assets and leadership.\n\nThe dispute spilled into the courts, with competing leaders registering different entities, each claiming to represent the original AFM.\n\nIn the current matter, the AFM is suing Abraham Masamba, Amon Nyika Chinyemba and Odar Housing Development Consortium over control of property, with Nehanda appearing as its representative.\n\nProfessor Lovemore Madhuku representing two AFM pastors argued that because AFM is a universitas  a legal entity without physical existence  Nehanda, as its office bearer, should have testified first.\n\nJustice Christopher Dube-Banda dismissed an objection raised by Madhuku, representing two AFM pastors, who argued that Nehandas testimony was inadmissible because he had sat in court while other witnesses testified.\n\nThe fact that he was not the first to testify and was sitting in court while other witnesses were testifying does not affect the admissibility of his evidence, the judge ruled.\n\nIt is not an issue of admissibility, but of weight.\n\nThe court sided with AFMs counsel, who maintained there is no rule of law that bars a witness who was sitting in court during the testimony of another witness from testifying.\n\nThe judge also cited regional jurisprudence, stressing that similar objections had failed in Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana and Zambia.\n\nIt would have been preferable that Rev. Nehanda was to be the first to testify. However such does not debar a witness from testifying, he said.\n\nThe ruling is the latest twist in AFMs protracted legal wars, which have seen congregants, pastors, and church leaders locked in disputes over who controls the churchs lucrative assets.\n\n",
