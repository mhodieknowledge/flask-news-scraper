Gunundu emphasised that the tournament is not just a game, but a platform to support the next generation of agribusiness leaders.\n\nProceeds will benefit two key initiatives: the ZAS Master Farmer Training Programme, designed to equip farmers with critical skills and boost their confidence, and the ZAS Scholarship Programme, which offers financial assistance to students pursuing diplomas in agriculture, horticulture, and animal science, he said.\n\nIn addition to the tournament, attendees will be treated to a thrilling performance by the international Backsplit Performance Bikers, known for their high-energy, precision biking displays.\n\nGunundu described the event as a unique mix of sport and agricultural advocacy, promising an unforgettable experience while highlighting the bright future of Zimbabwes agricultural community.\n\n",

Until and unless section 8 of the Immigration Act is declared unconstitutional and such declaration is confirmed by the Constitutional Court, the courts hands are tied.\n\nThe provision gives immigration authorities up to 14 days to verify an individuals identity, nationality and antecedents.\n\nThe Chief Immigration Officer opposed Mupenzis release, stating that his nationality was still under investigation and that none of the documents he presented substantiated his claim to refugee status.\n\nApplicants identity and nationality status have been questioned by the countrys security apparatus, the court was told.\n\nThe judge acknowledged Mupenzis complaint over not being given reasons for his detention, but made it clear that release was not the remedy. Whilst applicant might have a genuine grievance that he was not furnished with reasons for the arrest and detention forthwith, I am not persuaded that the remedy for that is his immediate release, she said.\n\nThere was no order regarding costs.\n\n",

Just recently, mineral exporting companies revealed that the central bank has not been paying their 30% export surrender in local currency.\n\nThe latest decision by Bitumen Worlddemonstrates the authorities appetite to uphold currency stability even at the cost of other critical economic imperatives.\n\nThe Zimbabwean government, one of the companys largest debtors, is experiencing significant challenges in making timely payments to its contractors. The government is facing delays in settling arrears, affecting various projects, including road rehabilitation and dam construction.\n\nWhile efforts are underway to establish payment plans and small payments have been received, these financial constraints have contributed to the companys decision to realign its operations to remain resilient in a challenging fiscal environment, said the company.\n\nThe company said this necessary transition reflects a committed effort to adapt to the current economic challenges, including operating under cash flow pressures caused by delayed payments from clients.\n\nBW said it recognises and deeply values the dedication and professionalism of all its employees and is committed to handling the process with respect, transparency, and dignity, offering support to those affected through severance packages and transition assistance.\n\nBW CEO, Andre Zietsman, said the decision has been very tough but had to be made due to limited options at hand.\n\nOver recent months, we have engaged in extensive discussions and evaluations to guide Bitumen World through this difficult period. While the decision to restructure was not made lightly, it is essential for ensuring our long-term viability and ability to continue contributing meaningfully to infrastructure development in Zimbabwe and beyond, he said.\n\nHe said the employees who have worked tirelessly to restore the countrys infrastructure glory will, unfortunately, suffer heavy blows when they see their jobs going down the drain.\n\nThe tragedy of these layoffs is that they impact the very people who built this prestigious brand  a brand that was wholly created by Zimbabweans, said Zietsman.\n\nThe company committed to handling the process with respect, transparency, and dignity, offering support to those affected through severance packages and transition assistance.\n\n",
