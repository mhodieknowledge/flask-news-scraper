I think they really want to make a statement over the next couple of weeks.\n\nThe home sides preparations has been to focus on building intensity and volume while ensuring all fundamentals are being addressed before shifting to specific tactical planning.\n\nDespite the demanding sessions, Sammons said the players had responded with enthusiasm and purpose.\n\nHe added: Right now, its more about making sure were covering all our bases . . . its more around the volume, and then we get a little bit more specific as we head closer to the Test.\n\nThe attitude is good. Its always good. We can never fault the attitude. Theyre always wanting to get the most out of each other and improve as much as they can, and again, theyve shown that over the last few days.\n\nThe second and final Test of series will also be played at the Queens Sports Club in Bulawayo from 6 July before the teams move to Harare for a T20I tri-series that will also feature New Zealand.\n\n",

            "content": "The Citizen\n\nA child abuse case has stalled after the alleged perpetrators, the guardians of a Grade 5 learner from Skeen Primary School, reportedly took her to Zimbabwe, leaving police struggling to gather evidence.\n\nThe family violence, child protection, and sexual offenses commander confirmed that the child was taken out of South Africa before critical evidence could be obtained. The learners statement was not yet obtained and she had not been taken to a doctor. The learner must be taken to the doctor to prove the case.\n\nThe investigating officer said he suspects the accused guardians took the child to Zimbabwe to kill the case. This was corroborated by Skeen Primary School deputy principal Masilo Lebeya, who revealed that the guardians took the child away swiftly, in the wake of allegations of abuse, and ahead of her June examinations, without informing the school. We only learned of her whereabouts when a social worker contacted one of the suspects, who admitted taking her to Zimbabwe, Lebeya said, adding that the school subsequently opened a case of abuse at the Sandringham Police Station.\n\nWhen asked if there were early, telltale signs that the victim was being abused, Lebeya said they were only seen at a later stage, and that the process of counselling the victim was only initiated when they confirmed that she had a family problem. Remember, we are dealing with a lot of children here. You might find that, by the time a teacher notices that she needs to intervene, it is a bit late. It shows that the child has been suffering in silence, he noted, further emphasising that the school has a strong support system and they have always encouraged children to share their problems.\n\nMatheba said they are trying to get the accused guardians to co-operate. He stressed that, without it, the police will not be able to build a case. Matheba said if they do not co-operate, the police will have to work with home affairs immigration authorities to verify the victims legal status in South Africa. If she was here illegally, then we would have to involve authorities on that side, to get her a passport so that she can be transported back to South Africa, and that will be a long process.\n\n",

            "content": "By Joseph Chirume,GroundUp\n\nLast month, the killing of a South African man in Valencia, Addo, spurred devastating xenophobic revenge attacks, killing at least four immigrants and injuring dozens. Hundreds of families were displaced from their homes.\n\nOn Sunday, to mark World Refugees Day, about 200 residents of Valencia, South Africans and immigrants, came together at the community hall. They prayed for peace and order in their community.\n\nCandles were lit and 10 white balloons were released as a sign of peace. Half the balloons were released by the family members of Juane September, the South African man whose murder sparked the attacks. The other half were released by Zimbabweans.\n\nGerald September, Juanes father, was at the event. I dont think I will ever recover from this tragic loss, he said.\n\nZimbabwean pastor and Valencia resident of ten years Ngonidzashe Chikanya said the prayer session was also meant to help displaced immigrants reintegrate into the community.\n\nHe said those affected were still dumbfounded by the incident as it happened within the blink of an eye.\n\nPeople are still in shock.\n\nIn the streets of Valencia, peace and calm seem to have returned. Many of the displaced families have returned. However, more than 100 Zimbabweans who were arrested by the Department Home Affairs while trying to seek shelter from the attacks, have opted to bevoluntarily deported.\n\nA Zimbabwean man who recently returned to Valencia said while he was away his home was robbed of all his belongings. No one wants to account for that, he said. This has put him back 10 years and he has had to borrow money to pay rent and purchase essentials, he said.\n\nMorne Serome, deputy chairman of a newly formed group of South African and Zimbabwean church leaders, said they will visit local schools soon to educate children about the importance of living peacefully with immigrants.\n\nIts time for the church to play a pivotal role in bringing people together, Serome said.\n\nGrade seven learner Lihle Kula, 16, said she was heartbroken to witness immigrants being killed and beaten by people who had lived with them for several years.\n\nI was powerless and at the same time fearing for my life. I could do nothing because the mob was angry and violent. It is very disturbing that a person leaves his country to look for opportunities in a foreign country, only to return home in a coffin after being murdered in cold blood.\n\nShelton Ciyangwa, Secretary General of the Zimbabwe Migrants Support Network, said two of the deceased Zimbabweans had been repatriated to Zimbabwe. Another deceased, from Malawi, has also been repatriated. The network is still raising funds to repatriate a third deceased, from Zimbabwe. And a fourth man is yet to be identified by family or next of kin.\n\nThere have still not been any arrests of perpetrators of the violence, police spokesperson Warrant Officer Majola Nkohli said.\n\n",
