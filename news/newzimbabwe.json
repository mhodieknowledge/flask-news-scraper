            "content": "IOL\n\nEast and Southern Africa is regarded as a central component for organised crime, which connects regional criminal markets to global networks.\n\nThis was revealed in the Global Initiative report, which stated that the region serves as a thriving source, hub and conduit for a wide variety of illegal commodities.\n\nThese criminal syndicates operate from the shores of Somalia to border crossings and international air and sea points in Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Namibia.\n\nFor example, heroin trafficked from Afghanistan via Pakistan and Iran, is shipped across the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean by boat before it is deposited in the northern Mozambique and Tanzania.\n\nThere, according to the report titled Mapping Organised Criminal Economies in East and Southern Africa, it splits into two primary supply lines: One of higher purity bound for international markets in Europe and Australia, and another that is significantly adulterated and consumed in towns and villages across the East and Southern Africa.\n\nAccording to the report, rhino is smuggled from Johannesburg and Addis Ababa, routed through Dubai and Doha and sometimes Paris and London to throw off law enforcement.\n\nIvory departs in shipping containers from ports in Der es Salaam, Nampula and Durban, ending up in Singapore, Sihanoukville, Huangpu and Haiphong.\n\nGold is mined illegally in Zimbabwes mineral-rich Kwekwe gold fields and deep shaft mines in the towns of Krugersdorp, Carletonville, Klerksdorp and Welkom in South Africa. It is processed and eventually laundered through Dubai.\n\nThe report added that gold is also smuggled by the tonne into countries along the strife-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)s eastern border and laundered through Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nIn the northern Mozambique and KwaZulu-Natal province, Islamic State-aligned insurgents and supporters have been implicated in criminal economies, gold smuggling, and kidnapping and extortion schemes to raise funds.\n\nThe region has attracted a coterie of international criminal players, according to the report.\n\nFor instance, networks from China, Pakistan and Iran are known to interface with African intermediaries for drug trafficking (drug precursor chemicals, methamphetamine and heroin) and wildlife smuggling (notably of abalone and ivory). In Southern Africa, Nigerian and Congolese syndicates, often operating from hubs such as Johannesburg, coordinate regional drug distribution and financial fraud schemes while also connecting to global diaspora networks.\n\nThe report added that this chaotic mixture of different criminal commodities and networks is, in many ways, shaped by geography and coalesces around a spiders web of regional hubs and economic centres.\n\nEnvironmental, social and regional dynamics in hinterlands allow warlords and smugglers to thrive, while bustling trade hubs provide cover for clandestine flows and access to key transport links.\n\nIn urban slums, neglected towns and remote rural communities, criminal actors and parallel illicit economies rapidly fill the void left by an often absent state. Ancient trade and migratory routes over mountains and along rivers and coastlines that long pre-date colonial borders allow for the largely untrammelled movement of people and goods, both licit and illicit. This means many of these trafficking networks and criminal groups are found concentrated in certain illicit hubs, reads the report.\n\nCrime expert at the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), Willem Els, added that poor governance is one of the reasons behind the challenges in the region andallows the situation to get out of control.\n\nIf you look at criminality levels, you will see that South Africa is number one in the region and number three in the continent. It is also number seven in the world. That means we created an environment that is conducive for organised crime to thrive. And one of the main factors is the State-embedded actors because none of these criminal syndicates can effectively survive without the protection of politicians and without the compromising of senior officials, Els said.\n\nHe said South Africa is rapidly approaching a failed State scenario where the rule of law is completely crumbled.\n\nSouth Africa is also suffering because of corruption, infrastructure, weak border controls and financial systems, and criminals are exploiting that, he said.\n\nThe report added that the Gauteng province is arguably the most significant organised crime hub in Southern Africa.\n\nAs the regions economic heart, with excellent transport links (notably airports and highways) and financial infrastructure, Johannesburg attracts many criminal enterprises. It is a crucial distribution centre for drugs (heroin arriving from East Africa and cocaine direct from Latin America or via West Africa) destined for local consumption or re-export.\n\nSouth African law enforcement notes that domestic and foreign drug trafficking syndicates converge in Johannesburg  for instance, Nigerian networks base themselves there to manage Southern African operations and South Asian cartel operatives have been detected collaborating with local crime bosses.\n\nJohannesburg is also a central hub for human smuggling and trafficking rings: victims from poorer African countries (including Malawi, Mozambique and Lesotho) are brought to the citys informal brothels and labour markets, while the citys international airport serves as a transit point for traffickers moving people to Europe or the Middle East.\n\nCape Town, according to the report, is a hub for the narcotics trade, a market associated with gang activity, while Northern KwaZulu-Natal is a strategic location.\n\nWeak border controls and existing criminal networks make it a prime hub for various forms of organised crime.\n\n",

He reportedly discussed strengthening cooperation in trade, health, agriculture, mining, investment, technologyincluding milestones like ZIMSAT1and reaffirmed commitment to deepen ZimbabweJapan relations.\n\nOnly last week, the 82-year-old Zanu PF leader met with His Holiness Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican, where they reflected on the Catholic churchs vital role in Zimbabwes schools, hospitals, and social services, and shared views on peace and justice in todays world.\n\nBefore the jetleg could subside, Mnangagwa, whose initial days in office were toned around austerity to cut on spending on foreign travel, he was off to the East this Sunday.\n\nAccording to State media, Mnangagwa is expected to join fellow invited Heads of State and Government from 26 countries, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, at Tiananmen Square for a massive military parade among other activities hosted by China for the commemorations.\n\nThe Chinese Peoples War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-1945) was the first to break out and lasted the longest in the World Anti-Fascist War.\n\nAccording to reports, in 14 years, 35 million Chinese were killed or wounded. Japan officially surrendered on September 2, 1945 by signing the Instrument of Surrender.\n\nIn 2014, Chinas national legislature designated September 3 as Victory Day of its War of Resistance.\n\nA year later, the country held its first-ever large-scale parade at Tiananmen Square to mark the occasion.\n\nState media quoted Zimbabwes Ambassador to China, Abigail Shoniwa, saying President Mnangagwa, who left the Vatican last night, is one of a few African leaders invited to the event, signalling deep ties between Harare and Beijing.\n\nThe Presidents arrival is awaited and we are very excited, he is coming at the invitation of his counterpart, President Xi Jinping and he will be one of quite a number of Heads of State that are coming.\n\nPerhaps, I can take the opportunity to add that he is one of the very few African Heads of State coming, Shoniwa told State media.\n\nWhile in China, Mnangagwa is billed to hold bilateral talks with President Xi on deepening co-operation across various sectors.\n\nThe octogenarian leader will also dialogue with company executives with business interests in Zimbabwe.\n\nChina has supported Zimbabwes various local projects, including Hwange Units 7 and 8 expansion, Kariba South Hydro Power Extension, expansion of the Robert Gabriel Mugabe and Victoria Falls International Airports.\n\nChina is Zimbabwes largest source of investment with cumulative investments exceeding US$4,4 billion, including US$400 million in the past year alone. In 2024, bilateral trade surged to US$3,8 billion with 24 percent year-on-year growth.\n\nLast month, Mnangagwa presided over the signing ceremony of a US$55 million Economic and Technical Co-operation Agreement between Zimbabwe and China in Harare.\n\n",

The CZI identified nine areas requiring immediate intervention, including cutting the states debt to the private sector, adjusting a 30% foreign-currency retention threshold for exporters and reducing sugar taxes on beverage makers.\n\nIt also called for a currency policy revamp and for the central bank to formalise and legalise its proclamations on phasing out the use of the dollar, so as to strengthen business and investor confidence. Most transactions in the southern African nation are currently conducted with the greenback, and the authorities aim to end that practice and ensure the bullion-backed Zimbabwe Gold currency is used solely by 2030.\n\nZimbabwes Industry and Commerce Minister Mangaliso Ndlovu didnt immediately respond to a call to his mobile phone seeking comment.
