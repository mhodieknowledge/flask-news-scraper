            "content": "The Guardian\n\nBreast cancer diagnoses and deaths are projected to surge worldwide by 2050, the World Health Organizations cancer agency has said, with cases in the UK to rise by 21% and deaths by 42%.\n\nGlobally, one in 20 women will be diagnosed with the disease in their lifetime, with cases up 38% and deaths up 68% over the next 25 years, according to an analysis by the International Agency for Research onCancer(IARC).\n\nThere will be 3.2m new cases and 1.1m deaths a year worldwide by 2050 if current trends continue, the study found. In the UK, cases are expected to rise from 58,756 cases a year in 2022 to 71,006 cases a year in 2050. Deaths will jump from 12,122 a year in 2022 to 17,261 in 2050.\n\nThe findings werepublished in the journal Nature Medicine.\n\nEvery minute, four women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide and one woman dies from the disease, and these statistics are worsening, said the IARC scientist Dr Joanne Kim, one of the authors of the report.\n\nCountries can mitigate or reverse these trends by adopting primary prevention policies  and by investing in early detection and treatment.\n\nThe projected increase in cases worldwide is probably due to a mix of factors, including a growing and ageing global population, improvements in detection and diagnosis, and a higher prevalence of known risk factors for the disease.\n\nFactors that increase the risk of breast cancer include getting older, inherited faulty genes and a family history of the disease.\n\nGlobally, most breast cancer cases and deaths occur in women aged 50 and above, who account for 71% of new cases and 79% of deaths, the IARC said.\n\nAbout a quarter of breast cancer cases can be prevented, the studys authors said, for example by reducing alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy weight and becoming more active.\n\nBreast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women worldwide but its burden is not evenly distributed. The IARC said diagnosis rates were highest in Australia and New Zealand, followed by North America and northern Europe, and lowest in Asia and Africa. However, death rates were highest in Melanesia and Polynesia, and in west Africa.\n\nOver the last decade, incidence rates grew by 1% to 5% a year in 27 of 50 countries studied, the IARC said. Importantly, breast cancer mortality rates decreased in 29 of 46 countries analysed.\n\nDr Isabelle Soerjomataram, the deputy head of the IARCs cancer surveillance branch, said: Continued progress in early diagnosis and improved access to treatment are essential to address the global gap in breast cancer and ensure that the goal of reducing suffering and death from breast cancer is achieved by all countries worldwide.\n\n",

He also severed ties with former mentor Kanye West when he ran for president, suspecting it was part of a wider Trump campaign tosiphon black peoples votes away from the Democrats.\n\nThe debate over Rwandas relationship with popular global figures is also not new.\n\nMost recently, Rwanda has been accused of sportswashing  with critics saying it uses the feel-good factor of international football to cover up alleged human rights abuses at home.\n\nThe East African nation is said to receive $1bn (800m) a year in foreign aid and its tourism arm  Visit Rwanda  has lucrative sponsorship deals with Arsenal in England, Bayern Munich in Germany and Paris St-Germain in France.\n\nWhen asked his thoughts on the topic, Legends aide told the BBC that he would not answer that question.\n\nIt appears that, as far as Legend and his team are concerned, his music itself should do the talking.\n\n",

After the lapse of the two-month period and on the 20 November 2024, the concerned stakeholders who first witnessed the item being taken into custody by ZIMRA were again summoned to witness the breaking of the sculptor the clearing agent.\n\nWhen the sculpture was broken, it was discovered that there were five rhino horn pieces which were wrapped by a newspaper and tied by a transparent plastic hidden inside.\n\nThe agent implicated the accused as the one who gave him the sculpture which contained the recovered rhino horn pieces.\n\nThe agent called Wang to come to the airport to answer the questions relating to the case but the accused disappeared.\n\nThe five Rhino horn pieces were seized by Zimra on notice of seizure receipt number 024315L.\n\nThe recovered exhibit was conveyed to Zimparks for assaying where it was assayed in the presence of the agent since the accused was on the run and it was found to be five pieces of rhino horns all valued at US$ 360 000.\n\n",

Growth in export volumes was buttressed by the firming of export prices to an average 75 US cents per kg from 44 US per kg cents achieved in the prior year following global easing of Covid-19 imposed restrictions.\n\nThe company sold 60% of its non-exportable secondary grade for oil extraction and to the retail and informal sector, while 40% was unsalable.\n\nIn the ensuing financial year, it is expected that the previously unsalable secondary grades will be channelled towards crude oil extraction.\n\nMacadamia production of 1 626 tons increased by 77% over prior year production of 921 tons. Exports declined by 3% to 1 508 tons from 1551 tons in the previous year, due to logistical issues caused by rescheduled ships, affecting the last consignment of 286 tons.\n\nThe decline in packed tea sales volumes of 7% from 1 873 tons in the prior year to 1 733 tons in this financial year was due to packaging material supply constraints, depressed performance from the traditional formal customers and overall macroeconomic dynamics.\n\nThe operating environment is expected to remain complex, largely influenced by adverse developments on currency and inflation. The effects of the El Nino-induced drought are likely to persist until the next harvesting period in April 2025, added Nkala.\n\n",
