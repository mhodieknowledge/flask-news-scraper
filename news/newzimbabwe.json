            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTRANSPORT and Infrastructure Development Minister, Felix Mhona says government is ready to terminate deal with contractors, who produce shoddy work falling far short of meeting publics needs and expectations.\n\nHe made the remarks while speaking to the press at the end of the week-long media tour in Plumtree Friday as he emphasised that badly performing contractors poor jobs will not be tolerated going forward.The Transport minister said the Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (PRAZ) subjects all contracts to rigorous reviews which are also taken under consideration by an independent board, which verifies all approvals to ensure competency is given priority.The government is determined to ensure that only competent and reliable firms remain engaged on key projects because we prioritise service delivery. Dealing with human beings, at times you think that you have the best player and when it comes to the issue of real work, it might not be in tandem with your expectations. This is an ongoing process and if they fail to perform, the contracts will be terminated, he said.He expressed commitment to conclude the Plumtree  Maitengwe Border Post Road in Bulilima District currently being constructed by local firm, Enock Construction Company which has since commenced work on a 10km stretch that starts in Plumtree town and extends just beyond Tsambani Shops at Makwa River in Village 28 along the Plumtree  Dombodema Road.From Harare through Masvingo to Beitbridge, works are ongoing, and today we are here in Bulilima District on this important road leading to the Maitengwe Border Post. The project will not only enhance cross-border trade but also uplift local livelihoods through employment creation.This road will help open up our borders to promote trade and improve the lives of people in this community, said Mhona.On completion, the road is expected to provide a vital link between Zimbabwe and Botswana through the busy Maitengwe Border Post, easing congestion and boosting trade once complete.\n\nHe made the remarks while speaking to the press at the end of the week-long media tour in Plumtree Friday as he emphasised that badly performing contractors poor jobs will not be tolerated going forward.\n\nThe Transport minister said the Procurement Regulatory Authority of Zimbabwe (PRAZ) subjects all contracts to rigorous reviews which are also taken under consideration by an independent board, which verifies all approvals to ensure competency is given priority.The government is determined to ensure that only competent and reliable firms remain engaged on key projects because we prioritise service delivery.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA HARARE magistrate has issued a warrant of arrest for socialite Admire Mushambi, popularly known as Mama Vee, after he failed to show up and give his testimony regarding the now-infamous E-Creator Ponzi scheme that swindled thousands of unsuspecting Zimbabweans.\n\nMagistrate Francis Mapfumo issued the warrant after Mushambi failed to appear in court, where his associate, fellow socialite Tarisai Madam Boss Chikocho, was testifying.Chikocho said Mishambi is the one who introduced her to the Chinese accused of duping unsuspecting clients.The Chinese nationals Jao Zhao Jiatong and Willian Chui, are accused of allegedly masterminding the multimillion-dollar pyramid scheme.The State says the pair lured the public into investing in a fake online platform that promised unrealistic returns.Jiatong and Chui created E-Creator with the intention to dupe unsuspecting people, the State said.They misrepresented that investors would realise huge profits from their deposits when, in truth, no such investment platform existed.According to the State, victims were encouraged to send money through various EcoCash lines allegedly controlled by the accused. The funds amounting to over US$250,000 were later withdrawn and converted into cryptocurrency.The court also heard that the accused later roped in another man, only identified as Billy, to help process the illicit transactions, while EcoCash agent Blessing Julias handled some of the withdrawals.During her testimony, Madam Boss told the court that Mushambi was the one who introduced her to the E-Creator scheme.I can recall that sometime in June 2023, I was informed by Mushambi that the accused (Jiatong and Chui) wanted me to market their company, which they said was an investment platform, she said.She told the court that she and her manager, Fanwell Masunugure, met the accused at their Joina City offices.They told us they wanted us to advertise their company and invite Zimbabweans to invest through the supplied link for profit. I then advertised their company on my Facebook page together with Mushambi the same day I met them. I was paid US$700 for the services.Chikocho added that she even invested US$100 into the scheme herself and encouraged her husband and relatives to join.The E-Creator scam, which collapsed last year, left thousands counting their losses.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nCONTROVERSIAL tenderpreneur Wicknell Chivayo has warned out-of-favour Bikita South legislator, Energy Mutodi, that he should enjoy his last supper in Parliament, because he will ensure he does not return in 2028.\n\nChivayo, a business tycoon and convicted criminal, jumped to the defence of Ministry of Finance Permanent Secretary George Guvamatanga, after Mutodi accused him of corruption.\n\nWicknell Chivayo\n\nLast week, Mutodi requested that Parliament summons Guvamatanga to answer to corruption charges after allegations emerged that the Treasury head was demanding kickbacks worth millions of US dollars from contractors.\n\nMutodi alleged in Parliament that contractors were unwilling to offer government services because Guvamatanga was demanding kickbacks of between five and 10 percent, threatening to withhold payments if they refused.\n\nFollowing a fierce backlash from his fellow party members, including Politburo members, Mutodi backed down and apologised for calling Guvamatanga a corrupt oligarch.\n\nHowever, this was not enough to save him from being demoted from his position as chairman of the Budget and Finance Parliamentary Portfolio Committee.\n\nMany critics, including lawyers such as Tendai Biti and David Coltart, condemned Mutodis demotion as unconstitutional and a threat to Parliaments oversight role.\n\nThe removal of Energy Mutodi as Chairman of the Budget Committee is the perfect opportunity for opposition MPs to exercise Parliamentary Privilege to speak about the allegations originally leveled by Mutodi against George Guvamatanga and by others against Kuda Tagwireyi, Coltart posted on his X (formerly Twitter) account on Thursday.\n\nColtart urged opposition MPs to rise to the occasion and defend Mutodi, saying his demotion was an attack on Parliamentary privileges. Coltart believes the opposition MPs shouldnt remain silent when such a privilege is attacked before their very eyes.\n\nThis is what parliamentary privilege is all about  it gives MPs a unique opportunity to speak on a public platform, which is recorded in Hansard and thus available to the public, on topics which other citizens cannot do without fear of defamation actions or worse.\n\nUntil now there has generally been a deafening silence from MPs . Now is the time in #Zimbabwe for them to show their mettle and prove that the electorate was justified in placing their trust in this crop of MPs, he added.\n\nIn response, Chivayo told Coltart to recruit Mutodi into their opposition Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) party, because he was no longer wanted in Zanu PF, warning that in 2028 he would make sure Mutodi does not win the Zanu PF primary elections.\n\nMutorei ku CCC kana ku Zanu hatichamudi, as an honourable member trusted with the position of chairman of a portfolio committee we dont expect you speculate or conjecture in Parliament. Kana seat rake next election we will make sure anodyiwa ku ma primary, he posted on his X account Thursday.\n\nCritics were also quick to point out that individuals like Chivayo wouldnt remain silent when their corrupt colleagues, like Guvamatanga, were under attack.\n\nOn social media, people have also suggested that Guvamatanga and Chivayo are part of the same corrupt network, and that an injury to one is an injury to all.\n\nMany also believe that Chivayo is part of a corrupt cartel that Vice President Constantino Chiwenga referred to as Zvigananda  individuals who amass wealth through corruption.\n\n",
