            "content": "By Sbo Gyre l Daily Maverick\n\nIVAN Mazuze is an acclaimed saxophonist whose latest offering, Penuka, exposes the depth of global influence and exchange of African culture through music.\n\nThe connections that Africa has to the rest of the world are well documented. From archaeological discoveries to food and other tangible goods brought about by trade, the plethora of threads that tie the continent to the rest of the world runs deep.Music is no exception. From the banjo, an African instrument now synonymous with American cowboy culture, and percussion drums used in many a musical ensemble, the continents contributions can be seen and equally heard.If I bring an influence of Indian music into African traditional music, its because African traditional music, even in history, has been influenced by the encounter of different traditions from other continents and still exists today, says Ivan Mazuze, acclaimed saxophonist and a forever student of jazz and other music.The Mozambique-born, Norway-based composers latest album, Penuka, delves into the profound influence of Arab and Indian cultures on African traditional music, presented through a contemporary jazz lens.The music is a testament to the centuries-old cultural exchanges facilitated by trade routes across the African continent.Mazuzes sixth studio album keeps true to his insatiable desire to blend the academia of his art form with the art itself. The score may differ in its notation, but the deep-seated and introspective themes prevail  the legacy of his musicological studies.From my debut album, I was busy with my identity. Those first five albums identify me as an African. I managed to keep reminding myself who I am through music, sound and composition, he says.This intentionality shines through his discography as his understanding of his context conjures a self-awareness personified through the music.I thought music will be a great tool to place myself in this vast industry and various tales of where we come from.But as any African will tell you, the depth of cultural richness the continent possesses makes it an endless tapestry of discovery.We are going to pass on a contribution  we cannot give it all, Mazuze explains.There are questions about globalisation and its effects on the African cultural zeitgeist. The challenge comes in finding the sweet spot that does not take away from what natives of Africa have contributed and continue to contribute.From my years in meeting people who dont come from the same cultural background as [us]  I always try to find what makes us common, the foundation that makes us human beings.Then, when it comes to technical questions like music itself, the way the music, the rhythm and the beat breathe, I find more equality than difference from my perception. Im always searching for what is common.The opening track of the LP perhaps best exemplifies this intention. Titled Bongile, meaning We are thankful or grateful in isiXhosa, his introduction to us of his sonic universe is inspired by the traditional music styles of the nomadic peoples in Indias Rajasthan state.Bongile tells a story of migration and cultural exchange, highlighting the interactions between Rajasthani culture and other cultures, including those in Africa.The vocals caress ones eardrums in an unusual yet distantly familiar way, guiding ones immersion in the music.The project also taps into the gravity that spirituality plays in this amalgamation over time. Stretching not too far away from southern Africa, songs like Mamidje pay homage to African religious practices, particularly those centred on spirit possession rituals, which are prevalent in the region.Featuring highly acclaimed Zimbabwean vocalist and guitarist Maxwell Vidima, the song specifically praises the ritual known as bira, from Zimbabwe, in which music and dance are used to invite ancestral spirits to communicate with the living.Through this composition, Mazuze pays tribute to the enduring cultural significance of these ancestral rituals and his late brother of the same name.His unwavering dedication to the continent of his birth and the power music has to transmit that pride have set him apart in his illustrious career.As an artist, what I have learnt, especially because I have travelled quite a bit, is that people and fellow musicians are interested in you and where you come from.I learnt that we often try to portray to be someone else, but societies out there are interested in where we come from. They find it interesting to listen to something else that is not a part of globalisation.Penuka means to expose in Tsonga and Mazuze has dug deep in his knowledge bank and experiences to stay true to this. His performance at this years Cape Town International Jazz Festival unveiled yet another level of a cavernous topic. But it all will be in vain if this form of archival work is not codified in some significant way. For Mazuze, this is a task that can only lay in particular hands.Governments and cultural institutions also have the responsibility of mixing commercial trading with commercial culture, he says.We have this opportunity, with all these educational institutions, to conduct more research to mark down the history we have now. We have a chance to correct our mistakes so our next generations have a greater resource to create.A lot of African history has been lost over time due to many reasons, but the work of people like Mazuze addresses this, bridging the past to the present and laying the foundations for future generations.

Stretching not too far away from southern Africa, songs like Mamidje pay homage to African religious practices, particularly those centred on spirit possession rituals, which are prevalent in the region.Featuring highly acclaimed Zimbabwean vocalist and guitarist Maxwell Vidima, the song specifically praises the ritual known as bira, from Zimbabwe, in which music and dance are used to invite ancestral spirits to communicate with the living.Through this composition, Mazuze pays tribute to the enduring cultural significance of these ancestral rituals and his late brother of the same name.His unwavering dedication to the continent of his birth and the power music has to transmit that pride have set him apart in his illustrious career.As an artist, what I have learnt, especially because I have travelled quite a bit, is that people and fellow musicians are interested in you and where you come from.I learnt that we often try to portray to be someone else, but societies out there are interested in where we come from. They find it interesting to listen to something else that is not a part of globalisation.Penuka means to expose in Tsonga and Mazuze has dug deep in his knowledge bank and experiences to stay true to this. His performance at this years Cape Town International Jazz Festival unveiled yet another level of a cavernous topic. But it all will be in vain if this form of archival work is not codified in some significant way. For Mazuze, this is a task that can only lay in particular hands.Governments and cultural institutions also have the responsibility of mixing commercial trading with commercial culture, he says.We have this opportunity, with all these educational institutions, to conduct more research to mark down the history we have now. We have a chance to correct our mistakes so our next generations have a greater resource to create.A lot of African history has been lost over time due to many reasons, but the work of people like Mazuze addresses this, bridging the past to the present and laying the foundations for future generations. DMSbo Gyre is an entertainment specialist and freelance writer.\n\nI thought music will be a great tool to place myself in this vast industry and various tales of where we come from.\n\nBut as any African will tell you, the depth of cultural richness the continent possesses makes it an endless tapestry of discovery.We are going to pass on a contribution  we cannot give it all, Mazuze explains.There are questions about globalisation and its effects on the African cultural zeitgeist. The challenge comes in finding the sweet spot that does not take away from what natives of Africa have contributed and continue to contribute.From my years in meeting people who dont come from the same cultural background as [us]  I always try to find what makes us common, the foundation that makes us human beings.Then, when it comes to technical questions like music itself, the way the music, the rhythm and the beat breathe, I find more equality than difference from my perception.

            "content": "By BBC News\n\nA VIGIL has been held in memory of two teenage boys who died after getting into difficulty in the water near Buncrana in County Donegal.\n\nThey have been named locally as 16-year-old Emmanuel Familola, originally from Nigeria, and 18-year-old Matt Sibanda, from Zimbabwe.Hundreds of people attended the special service at St Marys Oratory in Buncrana which was led by the Bishop of Derry, Donal McKeown.He began the service by welcoming Matt and Emmanuels family.Hundreds of people attended the special service at St Marys Convent in BuncranaBishop McKeown said there was a real palpable sense of gloom hanging around everybody today.However, he said he was struck by the number of people who turned up for the service.He said the Buncrana community pulled together in the face of tragedy, which he said showed their strength, but he also highlighted their welcome of people from abroad to the local community.They are strong looking inwards and supporting one and another, and strong looking outwards welcoming newcomers and thats a real blessing on everybody, he said.Irish government minister and Donegal TD, Charlie McConalogue, was among those who attended the service and said the news had come as an absolute shock.The community came out, really really strongly for the prayers service here, to try and provide some support and comfort to their families and friends, he said.Weve had our share of tragedies over the years in Inishowen and Buncrana and unfortunately it has visited two families here again.Mr McConalogue said he would work with the local community and liaise with the families and schools to ensure they received support.It was such a beautiful day and suddenly we got the news, the town has suffered tragedy in the past, so for a lot of people it brought that back up again for them, said local woman.That is going to be something that will be very important going forward to support the children in the school and the parents.No words can capture the painThe tragedy unfolded on Saturday afternoon after the Irish Coast Guard received a report that there were a number of people in difficulty in the water.Later that evening, an 18-year-old males body was recovered from the water.A juvenile who was rescued from the water was taken to Letterkenny University Hospital, where he died in the early hours of Sunday morning.A third teenage boy managed to make it back to shore.The Irish Coast Guard thanked all the search and rescue units and members of the public who assistedEvelyn McLoughlin principal of Scoil Mhuire in Buncrana, where Emmanuel attended, said there were no words that could fully capture the pain and sorrow that we are feeling.We are truly heartbroken, she said.Paying tribute Ms McLoughlin added: Emmanuel embodied the true ethos of Scoil Mhuire, he was known for his warm personality, gentle humour and thoughtful nature.He immersed himself fully in our school community and was highly regarded by staff and students alike.She added that the school will provide support for Emmanuels brother, who is a student there, through his unthinkable loss.The principals of Scoil Mhuire and Crana College delivered a joint statement to the mediaKevin Cooley, principal of Crana College, where Matt attended, added: As beautiful as today is, there is a dark cloud of sadness over Buncrana.Matt joined Crana College in January 2024, he was welcomed with open arms, he said.He was preparing for his leaving cert at the start of June. He was a determined young man, he was the most respectful young man you could ever meet.We share our thoughts and prayers to the families.Mr Cooley also thanked the emergency service for their efforts.Difficult to witnessSpeaking to BBC News NI, local priest Fr Francis Bradley said: You can only imagine they [the families] are absolutely devastated.Its difficult to witness, but powerful to witness a mothers love, her feeling of total abandonment.Last night, a mother sitting cradling her son, Ive looked at the Piet, but to see it brought alive in that way is very moving.To hear her call out his name, even though there was no hope, to know all I could do was stand in silence in the hope that there was a good shepherd calling his name.Here we do not view them as immigrants or asylum seekers, to us they are parishioners.Joe Joyce said one of the teenagers managed to make it back ashoreJoe Joyce from Lough Swilly RNLI said when they got the call they immediately launched two lifeboats.One of the teenagers managed to make it back ashore, he told BBC News NI.A former RNLI crew member, who was on the lough in his own personal boat, assisted the incident.He came on scene and and pulled another 16 year old out of the water.Around nine, half nine, we were starting to scale down the search as we lost the daylight and the Coast Guard had their drone team up.An object was detected in the water. That object turned out to be a person, an 18-year-old teenager.He was recovered by the Coast Guard to the pier in Buncrana, where a doctor on scene pronounced him dead.The incident happened near Neds Point, just outside Buncrana, at about 16:00 local time.Talented young boysThe mayor of Inishowen, Sinn Fins Jack Murray, told BBC News NI the community is devastated.On what was such a happy day, Donegal won the Ulster Championship, the sun was shining and then that filtered through, the worst news possible that these two young men have lost their lives, it is horrendous, he said.Paying tribute to the two teenagers, Murray said they were of different nationalities from Africa, who were talented young boys.It is just so sad that their lives could be cut short so tragically, he said.This is a community that has been visited by tragedy far too often, he added.I would like to think and hope that their families know that we are all thinking of them.An Irish Coast Guard helicopter was involved in the search off Buncrana beach on SaturdayIntegrated really well100% Redress councillor Joy Beard said people in the area are in shock.We are absolutely heartbroken, she said.Beard added that Buncrana is a strong community that will rally around the families.She also paid tribute to the emergency services and coast guard.Fianna Fil councillor Foinn Bradley said that the three teenagers involved in the incident came to Buncrana a number of years ago with their families and that they had integrated really well into the community.He added they were known by many people here in Buncrana and the community was very, very fond of them.He described the community as numb following the incident.There is a very sombre air over the whole area this morning.\n\nThey

            "content": "By Ashraf Hassen Coovadia l Daily Maverick\n\nWE all need to urgently recognise that climate change is not merely a distant socioeconomic issue  it is a current, unfolding health crisis affecting tens of millions globally.\n\nThe link between climate change and human health is well established, though perhaps not widely recognised by the public. This may be due to the issue being overshadowed by its economic and social implications, or insufficient emphasis in public discourse.\n\nThis week, the second G20 Health Working Group meeting is taking place in KwaZulu-Natal. While South Africas G20 health agenda looks at important issues such as stemming the tide of non-communicable diseases and Pandemic Prevention Preparedness and Response, there is a lack of focus on the impact of climate change on public health.\n\nHuman health is already being affected by climate change. To better understand these effects, its helpful to think in terms of direct and indirect pathways: those that are immediately visible and those with more delayed but substantial consequences.\n\nExtreme weather\n\nDirect impacts include the devastation caused by extreme weather events  storms, hurricanes and wildfires  which pose acute threats to survival.\n\nWhile these events often cause significant loss of life, many more are injured or displaced. Health systems are frequently overwhelmed, unable to manage the burden and critical services like immunisation programmes are disrupted.\n\nInfrastructure damage leads to economic hardship, exacerbating poverty and malnutrition, particularly among displaced populations.\n\nHeatwaves, occurring with increasing frequency and severity, directly affect health by causing dehydration, kidney dysfunction, heatstroke and even death. The number of such incidents is rising as these events become more common and prolonged.\n\nSome regions are now facing conditions that render them uninhabitable due to persistent extreme heat.\n\nIndirect consequences\n\nWhile direct effects impact on millions, most health consequences arise through slower, indirect pathways. These result from the disruption of ecosystems caused by rising temperatures and other human activities.\n\nOne notable example is the changing distribution of disease vectors. Mosquitoes that transmit diseases such as malaria and dengue are now thriving in new regions, with longer breeding seasons. This means that disease patterns across the globe are changing and healthcare systems need to adapt to this.\n\nAir quality is another critical area of concern. The link between pollution and respiratory health is well documented.\n\nWildfires that occur more often due to climate change produce fine particulate matter that can enter the lungs, worsening conditions such as asthma and chronic lung ailments.\n\nRising temperatures also increase ground-level ozone concentrations, further aggravating these conditions. Additionally, climate change has led to longer and more intense pollen seasons, contributing to the rise in allergic conditions such as hay fever and asthma.\n\nDiarrhoeal diseases are associated with climate change as we see a higher risk of infections that appear to have an increased prevalence in warmer temperatures, such as with Escherichia coli, Cryptosporidium, rotaviruses, and parasites (eg Giardia and toxoplasmosis gondii). Diarrhoeal rates are also affected by the availability of safe drinking water, which in turn is affected by both droughts and flooding events.\n\nClimate change has also been shown to affect the rates of interpersonal violence through heat-driven aggression and resource conflicts. Studies have linked higher temperatures and extreme weather to increased homicide, intimate partner violence and conflict.\n\nMental health impacts of climate change range from direct trauma that can cause post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) following an extreme weather disaster, to climate anxiety, especially in the youth, to displacement and loss of livelihood resulting from extreme weather events.\n\nThe 2023 Lancet Countdown names several vulnerable populations that are especially vulnerable to climate health risks:\n\nChildren are at higher risk due to their developing bodies and greater exposure;\n\nThe elderly, particularly those with pre-existing heart or lung conditions, are also at increased risk, especially during heatwaves;\n\nPregnant individuals represent another sensitive group, with growing evidence linking heat exposure to poor pregnancy outcomes such as low birth weight, preterm births and stillbirths; and\n\nThose who are socioeconomically disadvantaged, as they often live in areas more exposed to environmental hazards, have limited access to healthcare and fewer resources to adapt or recover from climate-related events.\n\nWe all need to urgently recognise that climate change is not merely a distant socioeconomic issue  it is a current, unfolding health crisis affecting tens of millions globally.\n\nAvoiding this crisis requires changing our individual habits, but more importantly, it requires advocating and working in our own communities towards a systemic change.\n\nProf Ashraf Hassen Coovadia is the academic head of the Department of Paediatrics and Child Health at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg.\n\n",

I urge Zimbabweans to look back home with a positive eye, come back and invest in Zimbabwe, build something here together with the second republic.\n\nOur President is doing fantastic work, you cannot fault that. The work that he is doing counteracts every negative publicity.\n\nThe Second Republic has done amazing work, there is major construction, major infrastructure development.\n\nPeople are happy. We are sailing through, we are crossing over, said Chikoto.\n\nHis comments fly in the face of millions unemployed youths and there is no hope of work opportunities despite the often hyped mega projects.\n\nMillions are facing starvation according to the United Nations (UN), not just in under-developed rural areas but urban areas such as the capital Harare and Bulawayo, the countrys second largest city.\n\nChikoto is no stranger to controversy. In 2022, the ex-premier faced a public backlash after visiting Mnangagwa at State House in Harare soon after his election.\n\n",
