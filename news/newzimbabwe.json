            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/richard-ngaravas-tall-tale-how-a-zimbabwe-fast-bowler-came-into-his-own/",
            "content": "ESPN\n\nIf youre interested in gaining height, ZimbabwesRichard Ngarava, who stands at 1.98 metres, is willing to let you in on his secret.\n\nAnyone who asks me how I got tall, I tell them I only ate vegetables, Ngarava says, the day after he helpedZimbabwe qualify for next years T20 World Cup. He is, of course, not being entirely serious, but his growth spurt from a chubby and short young teen to a lean, lanky one coincided with him deciding to take his health seriously.\n\nI put myself on a diet, and I dont even know why I did it, he says. At that time I was a batter and I bowled a bit of spin but in Grade Nine everything just changed. For close to four years, I was on a diet and I made sure I didnt miss any gym sessions. As a young boy, I loved pizza and fried chicken but I cut those out and told myself I am going to eat fruits and vegetables, and drink water only. Thats when I became tall.\n\nAt the time, Ngarava was a student at Churchill School but playing club cricket in the area he grew up in, Harares Highfield, which is home to the famous Takashinga Cricket Club. Also part of the club wasBlessing Muzarabani, presumably born tall and currently 2.07 metres. The pair became friends. We went to different schools but we both played for the same Takashinga age-group team. Weve been pushing each other since we were Under-12s, Ngarava says.\n\nThere was one important difference between the Ngarava and Muzarabani of the early 2000s and the players they are now. Back then, Blessing was a legspinner and I was mostly a batter, Ngarava says.\n\nAlso, incidentally the first time he came to international attention it was, in fact, for something that happened when he was batting. At the 2016 Under-19 World Cup,Ngarava was run-out at the non-strikers end by Keemo Paul of West Indies. Zimbabwe needed just two runs to winthat matchwhen Ngarava was dismissed. The run-out put West Indies in the quarter-final and sparked a debate about the spirit of cricket.\n\nWhen it happened, I thought it was a ruse, Ngarava says. I was not really happy when I walked off the field and everyone else was not happy in the dressing room. We later understood that it was part of the game. But what I didnt like about the situation was, there was no warning from anyone.\n\nWhile bowlers are not obliged to warn batters who are backing up too far, and there is no rule against running out a batter at the non-strikers end, in some circles it is thought of as polite to give a batter a warning. This has been at the heart of some of crickets culture wars in recent times.\n\nHas Ngarava ever thought of running a non-striker out while bowling? At some point maybe. But then I figured, nah, I just want to play normal cricket. I dont want to mess with peoples moods.\n\nAgain, not entirely true, because Ngarava says he turned to fast bowling as a teenager because he quite enjoyed just hurting people. Slowly he started to change that outlook. Under the guidance of his school coach George Tande he discovered an ability to swing the ball. I actually like taking wickets more than hurting people, he realised.\n\nHe made Zimbabwes age-group sides in his mid-teens and continued to represent Takashinga and was part of their first team. He credits them with his growth, particularly the clubs trips to Uganda, where they played that countrys national side. We didnt look at those as just normal games or club games, we looked at them as international games because we were playing Uganda, he says.\n\nOne day, when he was around 18, he received a call while he was in Uganda. It was his international call-up.\n\nNgarava made hisdebut against Afghanistanin an ODI in 2017, and two and a half years after that, playedhis first T20I. Though he was always comfortable opening the bowling, he soon became interested in bowling at the end of an innings. I wanted to be the best death bowler in the team, he says. But I ended up developing more skills as I played more games. I used to enjoy just bowling yorkers and short balls but Ive now added some other skills to my game.\n\nThe appointment of Charl Langeveldt to Zimbabwes coaching staff in the middle of 2024 was a game changer for Ngarava. It was around then that he developed an important weapon.\n\nThe wobble seam has done so much for me, he says. Sometimes you dont really know what the ball is going to do [with a wobbly seam] but I just want to target that fifth-stump line or fourth-stump line and whatever the ball is going to do there, Im quite happy with it.\n\nIts different from the normal seam, where you can actually see the seam from the hand and its easy to pick. Ive seen the English bowlers are doing it now more often, where theyre wobbling the ball. Its also different from Jimmy Anderson, where he actually had to make sure that his seam is up for him to swing the ball.\n\nNgarava got a first hand-hand look at the English bowlers when Zimbabwe toured there earlier this year to playa first Testin that country in over two decades. He was named in the starting XI and bowled nine overs in the first innings but could play no further part in the match after suffering a back injury on day one.\n\nIts not a nice feeling to get injured and still get to hang around the ground and see the boys playing, he says. It was really disappointing considering it was historic. We hadnt played England for so long and I also wanted to perform, he says. I felt bad for the team and I asked myself, Is this the right time to get injured? even though I knew I couldnt control it. I tried to hide those emotions and didnt show them to anyone.\n\nThe issue was caused by a bulging vertebral disc and Ngarava has not played in any of Zimbabwes four Tests since. That has been tough because he says playing the longest format is something that I really want to do. Of course, Zimbabwe are not part of the World Test Championship, and for now, their focus is on the next two major white-ball tournaments: the 2026 T20 World Cup and the 2027 ODI World Cup. They will co-host the latter with South Africa and Namibia.\n\nGetting to the first of those was crucial for maintaining the relevance of Zimbabwe cricket, after they were the only Full Member to miss out on the 2024 T20 World Cup because they lost to Uganda in the qualifiers. This time,Zimbabwe beat Uganda easily, Ngarava removed their best batter Raizat Ali Shah and also finished asthe joint leading bowler at the event. In the process he also became thefirst Zimbabwean to 100 T20I wickets.\n\nOrdinarily you would expect a team and one of their key players to celebrate under the circumstances, but Zimbabwe and Ngarava are just relieved. It was quite nice to qualify in front of the Harare fans but everyone is not really expressing the way they feel, he says. Maybe guys are still not sure that we actually qualified. Everyone is just calm about it because weve got that understanding of us wanting to actually play for the team more than individual performances.\n\nBut there is also excitement. I cant wait to be on that plane to India and Sri Lanka and then also play the 50-over World Cup, and hopefully we will do something for the fans.\n\nNgarava already has some experience of Sri Lanka from his time in theLanka Premier League in 2023and ontwo tours there for Zimbabwe. His LPL appearance was the first of several league gigs, including the BPL and the ILT20, though he hasnt yet played a game in those last two leagues. Most recently he picked up a deal at Sharjah Warriors in the ILT20, for whom he hopes to play in the UAE ahead of the T20 World Cup. His new-ball partner, Muzarabani, will also be there, for Gulf Giants, as the two bowlers journeys continue to mirror each other.\n\nIts funny how were both now seam bowlers, Ngarava says. I dont really know how it happened, But he does. Theyre both very, very tall and he knows how that helps. Before talent or before anything else, having good height as a fast bowler gives you an extra advantage.\n\n",

            "content": "By Kitsepile Nyathi, The East African\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has indicated that Zimbabwes external debt is understated by over $2 billion, a development that casts doubt on the countrys suitability for debt relief.\n\nZimbabwe, burdened with $21 billion debt, according to official figures, has been pushing for an urgent resolution with major Western creditors since the removal of long-time ruler Robert Mugabe in a military coup eight years ago, but without success.\n\nAccording to the IMFs newly released 2025 Article IV Consultation Report, Zimbabwes debt stood at a staggering $23.3 billion at the end of 2024, exposing a major discrepancy with the countrys acknowledged debt figures.\n\nThe Bretton Woods institutions findings echoed earlier observations by the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), which stated in its May country brief that Zimbabwes external debt was much higher than official estimates.\n\nZimbabwe has been accumulating arrears to external creditors for over two decades due to its failure to repay loans.\n\nTotal public and publicly guaranteed debt stood at $23.3 billion (72.9 percent of Gross Domestic Product) at the end of 2024, the IMF report reads.\n\nThe external debt stock was $16.7 billion (52.5 percent of GDP). Zimbabwe has been accumulating external arrears to its official creditors since the early 2000s, estimated at $7.4 billion (23.2 percent of GDP).\n\nMore recently, the government has started accumulating arrears to external commercial creditors, estimated at $47.4 million at the end of 2024 (0.1 percent of GDP), and has suspended servicing some of its domestic debt obligations, amounting to $425 million (0.8 percent of GDP) in 2025.\n\nThe IMF said the governments economic policies did not appear sufficient to extricate the country from the debt crisis.\n\nCurrent policies are insufficient to restore debt sustainability, which will require a balanced mix of fiscal consolidation, strengthened public debt management, growth-promoting structural reforms, and external arrears resolution-paving the way for new financing from multilateral and bilateral creditors, the report added.\n\nLoan defaults\n\nZimbabwe began defaulting on loan repayments to the World Bank, the IMF, and other lenders in 2000 under the regime of the late Robert Mugabe. The defaults escalated during the height of a controversial land reform programme that began around the same time, leading to the countrys international isolation and economic ruin.\n\nThe countrys biggest Paris Club creditors are Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States, with a combined external debt stock amounting to $2.9 billion-accounting for 74 percent of the total Paris Club external debt.\n\nSince 2019, Zimbabwe has been using the Structured Dialogue Platform (SDP), championed by then African Development Bank (AfDB) president Akinwumi Adesina and former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, to push for a debt clearance programme.\n\nThe IMF said the SDP provided a framework for engagement on three pillars: economic reforms, political-governance reforms, and farmers compensation and land tenure reforms.\n\nIt noted that while progress had been made on some sub-components, bilateral Paris Club creditors insisted that re-engagement required advances on all three pillars.\n\nA roadmap to clearing arrears to the international financial institutions including the World Bank, African Development Bank, and European Investment Bank-will be essential to facilitate an eventual debt resolution. But this would likely require support through a bridge loan, the IMF added.\n\nWhile discussions on a potential bridge loan are ongoing, creditors have called for an IMF Staff Monitoring Programme (SMP) to be in place before engaging on such financing.\n\nEarlier this year, Zimbabwe indicated that it was seeking debt relief and bridge financing of $2.6 billion through the SDPs Arrears Clearance and Debt Resolution Process.\n\nStaff indicated that the authorities programme that could be supported by an SMP would need to be broadly aligned with Article IV and recent capacity development advice, the IMF said.\n\nThe authorities have also initiated discussions with key commercial creditors on debt payment moratoria.\n\nIn July, World Bank president Ajay Banga warned that if Zimbabwe tried to go it alone, it would remain in a debt trap for the next five years.\n\nSouth Africa, which held the G20 presidency at the time, said Zimbabwe had sought support for its debt to be revamped under the G20s Common Framework. Such support could restore the countrys access to international markets for the first time in more than 20 years.\n\nThe Common Framework was created in 2020 to help poor countries bring together a diverse set of creditors to restructure debts.\n\nIt is not clear whether Zimbabwe would be eligible for treatment under the G20 Common Framework or the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, due to ineligibility from protracted arrears to multilateral creditors, and in HIPCs case, because Zimbabwes income exceeds the required IDA eligibility criteria, the IMF said.\n\nHowever, as shown in other cases such as Sri Lanka and Suriname, official creditors may be willing to provide an ad hoc treatment consistent with restoring debt sustainability.\n\nThe IMF noted that Zimbabwean authorities broadly agree with the unsustainable debt assessment and reiterated their commitment to the re-engagement process.\n\nIn this context, they highlighted recent progress under the SDP, where an initial payment to farmers covered by bilateral investment agreements was welcomed by partners, the report said.\n\nThe authorities also plan to launch a fourth SDP pillar focused on debt resolution, bringing creditors together to provide updates on the governments roadmap to restoring debt sustainability.\n\nThey emphasised the urgency of the process, as financing options have narrowed due to constrained access to concessional financing from official sector creditors, limited access to non-concessional commercial lenders, and challenges in the domestic capital market.\n\nZimbabwes debt stock has risen in recent years because it resorted to seeking cheap infrastructure loans from China. However, it has not been able to repay the money due to an ongoing economic crisis characterised by hyperinflation and instability.\n\nThe country has also been mortgaging its mineral resources, such as platinum, in exchange for financial support from China. Experts warn that this route is unviable and will leave the southern African nation in a serious debt trap.\n\nThis article was originally published inThe East African.\n\n",

One cannot build an unlawful road through someone elses land and then ask a court to declare that road to be lawful.\n\nAt the heart of the dispute was Crowhill Road, a route Crowhill residents claimed had historically provided them access to Borrowdale Road.\n\nThe City of Harare, however, in 2015 issued a letter stating it had no objection to Mount Breezes establishing a gated community, paving the way for the installation of gates that effectively blocked Crowhill residents from using the road.\n\nThe residents argued that the Citys decision was unlawful and that the servitudes establishing the road had been extinguished when the area was subdivided in 1999. But the court dismissed their claim, stressing that the association was improperly constituted, came into existence only in 2024, and was trying to reopen issues already settled by earlier rulings.\n\nA child born in 2024 cannot retrospectively challenge decisions that its parents made in 2015, the judge said, echoing the respondents argument.\n\nMambara also condemned the association for ignoring a binding 2014 consent order that gave Crowhill Farm (Pvt) Ltd exclusive authority to represent residents in legal matters until the development is fully regularised.\n\nThe court further held that the application was in substance a review of administrative action, disguised as a declaratory application, and was therefore grossly out of time since it sought to overturn a City of Harare decision made nine years ago.\n\nDismissing the application with punitive costs, the judge warned: The courts cannot connive at or condone the applicants open defiance of the law. Citizens are obliged to obey the law of the land and argue afterwards.\n\nThe ruling cements earlier judgments affirming Mount Breezes residents right to enjoy their gated community free from trespass and effectively ends Crowhill residents long-running bid to force open access through the estate.\n\n",
