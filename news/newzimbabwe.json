It was not an easy period. The only solace was that for every devilish dart aimed at me, there were ten in support. I received enormous support from the people around me.\n\nMy manager was always there, my family was fervently praying, my producer made melodies to soothe me. Clergymen, pastors, friends, government officialsyou name itall these people made the arduous journey traversable, said Moyo.\n\nThe award-winning gospel artist is no stranger to criticism, as it has been synonymous with her career.\n\nThe reproval over her voice projection has overshadowed the talent and lyrical depth her music carries.\n\nHowever, Moyo says she looks beyond criticism, focusing mainly on her craft.\n\nWhat doesnt kill you surely makes you stronger. Everyone is entitled to their opinion, and I respect that. I may not know the recipe for success, but surely the recipe for demise is trying to please everyone.\n\nThe few who appreciate my art are the most important, and I will continue to work to please them. Criticism is part of every living organism; as such, we must accept it, be it painful or constructive. That will make you a better person, she said.\n\nMoyos sorrow has been turned into dancing, with the musician being gifted a Toyota Fortuner by controversial businessman Wicknell Chivayo.\n\nChivayo said the gift was compensation for the humiliation she endured, along with an additional US$20,000 on top of the vehicle.\n\nRANGANAI HENYU, ASI ZVICHAKONAwhat was supposed to be a VERY BEAUTIFUL song, boldening our FAITH in God and affirming that whatever the DEVIL plots will NOT succeed, was unnecessarily turned POLITICAL. It spiraled into HATEFUL speech and CYBER-BULLYING at an unprecedentedpic.twitter.com/05YOi7M2gH\n\n sir_wicknell. (@wicknellchivayo)April 7, 2025\n\nMoyo said she was overwhelmed by Chivayos gesture.\n\nIt would be follyand the gravest level of wickednessshould one fail to appreciate such an astronomical act of generosity. He has a big heart, and I accept the gift with the utmost appreciation. Thank you, Sir Wicknell, for your unmatched kindness.\n\nTruly, the gift came as an analgesic to me after going through cyber atrocities aimed at me. I literally feel the pains dissolving, the tears drying, and my emotions reinvigorated, said Moyo.\n\n",

            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nHope for freedom continues to diminish for Alpha Media Holdings (AMH) journalist Blessed Mhlanga, who has been held in pre-trial detention at Harare Remand Prison for 42 days.\n\nHis latest bail application, which was denied for the third time  once by the High Court of Zimbabwe and twice by the Harare Magistrates Court  prompted another emotional letter from within the prison walls on Monday.\n\nMhlanga, the host of the Free Talk interview programme at Heart and Soul Television and Radio (HSTV) under the AMH banner, revealed he is battling a severeflu, exacerbated by the conditions in the overcrowded D class prison section where he is confined.\n\nHe has been placed in the prison section notorious for housing dangerous criminals, a kick in the teeth, one injustice too many.\n\nThrough his latest correspondence, penned on Monday, Mhlanga confessed to sleepless nights, a direct result of his ill health.\n\nHe wrote: As I write from this discomfort of my overcrowded cell, I am suffering from a serious bout of flue which has drained my strength and now threatens my inner peace. Sleep hardly comes as deep thoughts and lice battle for my attention at the most undesirable times. Such is the life I have lived for the past 41 days.\n\nMhlanga admitted that he is often overwhelmed by the gruelling ordeal he has endured for over 40 days. At times, he said, he breaks down, acutely aware of the states intention to inflict undue pain by prolonging his imprisonment. It appears the state intends to squeeze him dry.\n\nMy friends the journey has not been easy and it remains extremely difficult as we nudge forward; it is a marathon, not a sprint. It is very uncomfortable but unavoidable. It is a journey filled with frustrations and pain which at times overwhelms me to tears, anger and pushes me to the edge of emotional breakdown, Mhlanga said.\n\nHe continued: I am in pain, lost and sadly broken. This experience is not just a today event, but it will traumatize me for the rest of my life. It is a terrible battle which however I cannot afford to lose. It is not easy to keep going but I have no choice to quit nor the desire to stop.\n\nMhlanga expressed his deep gratitude for the emotional support he has received from fellow journalists, his legal team, family and friends, who have stood by him during his imprisonment.\n\nI have fought with everyone around me. I have fought with my fantastic legal team, and my fellow colleagues in the media who have been standing head and shoulders in my defense. I have fought with my employer of choice and even with my own family.\n\nHonestly, I cannot imagine how I would have survived without your voices of solidarity and love. Your donations towards my upkeep in this dark place will never be forgotten or taken for granted. My lawyers bring me all your encouraging words and deeds of compassion. I say this without fear of contradicting myself  it is you who have carried me.\n\nDespite the harsh and brutal conditions of the prison, Mhlanga reiterated his unwavering belief that he is being punished for defending the freedoms of others. He is resolved not to break.\n\nAlthough in pain, I remain unshaken and committed to my profession of choice. I strongly believe that it is the ordinary people who matter more than those who control the levers of power, he affirmed. He is determined to continue standing his ground, even if it means going down with the ship.\n\nMhlanga was arrested in February this year and charged under Section 164 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act Chapter 9:23 which criminalises the transmission of data that incites public violence.\n\nThe charge stems from HSTVs coverage of a heated press conference given by Blessed Geza, a former member of the Zanu-PF Central Committee and prominent war veteran. Geza warned Stephen Mutamba, the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) chief, against deploying officers to assault protestors demonstrating against President Emmerson Mnangagwa.\n\nGeza called for Mnangagwas immediate resignation, citing corruption, nepotism, excessive bureaucracy, tribalism, and his alleged attempts to extend his term beyond 2028  something legal experts have consistently maintained is legally untenable.\n\nMnangagwa himself has committed to stepping down in 2028 in respect of the constitution.\n\nGezas current location is unknown after the police released a statement indicating they are seeking him. He has been addressing Zimbabweans from an undisclosed location via his newly created X (formerly Twitter) handle and YouTube channel.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nThe government has become evasive on the value accumulated by the Mutapa Investment Fund (MIF) since its reconfiguration, with the entitys operations remaining opaque.\n\nFormerly the Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF), the MIF was established by an Act of Parliament in 2024. It was renamed the Mutapa Fund through Statutory Instrument 156 of 2023 by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, using the Presidential Powers (Temporary Measures) Act.\n\nThe MIF oversees the operations of state-owned entities such as ZUPCO, the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ), Kuvimba Mining House, and ZESA, among others.\n\nHowever, concerns have been raised over the lack of transparency, shielding the MIF from scrutiny by taxpayers.\n\nRecently, during a question-and-answer session, Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) Senator Moses Manyengavana questioned the Minister of Justice Ziyambi Ziyambi on the value of the assets under the MIF.\n\nMy question is people of Zimbabwe applaud the existence of the Sovereign Fund, which is a standard practice the world over but in our case and in the interest of transparency, it is in the national interest for the people of Zimbabwe to know the strength of the fund at the inception and where it is now. At what stage would the people of Zimbabwe begin to see the tangible benefits of the Mutapa Fund? asked Manyengavana.\n\nIn response, Ziyambi said the MIF is still evaluating the assets more than a year after its restructuring.\n\nActually, what the government has done is to lump all the government companies under the Mutapa Fund. So, what Mutapa Fund is doing now, is to quantify the actual value of the companies under Mutapa and once they finish that, then the public will be made aware of the value.\n\nIt is very good because it will allow us now to be credit-rated and we can actually borrow as a nation against that for any developments that we want. So, it is a very good question, but it is a work in progress that the fund is doing, said Ziyambi.\n\nLast year, MIF Chief Executive Officer John Mangudya indicated that they had engaged an external partner to evaluate the assets, which would assist in the recapitalisation of some of the entities.\n\nSo, that is what they are doing so that they will say, when we inherited, this is how we quantified it. They do not want to use historical data. They are doing it for themselves to say, we inherited ZUPCO, this is the status that it was like.\n\nWe inherited ZESA. We inherited this and then they come up with a wholesome figure to say, as Mutapa Fund, these are our assets, these are our liabilities as at inception and that is what they are doing, added Ziyambi.\n\n",

I would rather go back to SA and take up menial jobs, said Sothini Ncube, a vendor on the streets of Bulawayo, the second-largest city.\n\nNcube holds an honours degree in psychology but job opportunities in Zimbabwe are hard to come by. He has also grown frustrated that basic amenities are lacking and there is no government effort towards poverty alleviation.\n\nA newspaper vendor shows a poster about the unrest on April 1 2025. Picture: PHILIMON BULAWAYO\n\nThere are no pain killers in major hospitals in Zimbabwe. I would rather risk insults in SA but at least get some treatment when I fall sick.We are [stuck] between a rock and a hard place. SA should brace as usual for our influx, he added.\n\nIn February SA announced a nationwide operation to clamp down on illegal immigrants, but with uncertainty for many Zimbabweans growing due to political bickering in the governing party, many may be considering heading to SA.\n\nStevenson Dlamini, an economist from Zimbabwe, said SA should be concerned about the political situation up north because it could lead to a strain on its public services and infrastructure.\n\nSA has on numerous occasions struggled with unregulated Zimbabwean economic and political refugees. Not long ago [2023] an SA doctor [Limpopo health MEC, now premier Phophi Ramathuba] despite diplomatic pressure later, in a raw manner spoke the language of ordinary South Africans. She was not politically correct but she exposed what a political failure in Zimbabwe reflected on SA, he said.\n\nSA is Zimbabwes biggest trade partner and Zimbabwe is SAs gateway to Africa. Therefore, a politically insecure Zimbabwe is bad for business, according to Dlamini.\n\nFissures inside Zanu-PF developed at last years October conference in Bulawayo when a section aligned to Mnangagwa passed a motion to extend his term.\n\nThey proposed a two-way strategy: to extend his term, which ends in 2028, by two years; or to change the constitution to allow him a third term that would see him stay on until 2034.\n\nMnangagwa insists he will not stay beyond his constitutional term. But as the partys most senior member, the first secretary, he has not stopped those calling for constitutional change.\n\nThat is why Blessed Geza, who at the time was a member of Zanu-PFs central committee, decided to be the face of those resisting Mnangagwas extension.\n\nGeza mentioned people he called the looting mafia and political criminals aiding Mnangagwa to butcher the constitution for their selfish ends.\n\nA man sells mobile data on the morning of planned anti-government protests. Picture: KB MPOFU\n\nGeza was then fired from the party and placed on the polices wanted list. He is in hiding but calling on Zimbabweans to mount resistance through protests.\n\nGeza wants Mnangagwa to be replaced by his deputy Constantino Chiwenga, the protagonist of the November 2017 coup, who has not commented on the matter.\n\nParty spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa, in an interview with Dug Up, a Zimbabwean investigative group, accused Chiwenga of harbouring presidential ambitions. He also referred to Chiwenga as uneducated and unelectable for the presidency.\n\nMnangagwa moved with speed to change top bosses in the countrys security sector before the March demonstrations viewed as a failed coup attempt within Zanu-PF.\n\nMutsvangwa confirmed there were dramatic changes in the structure of our state apparatus to avoid an unconstitutional change of government.\n\nThey [security sector] proved they are not a joystick for political day dreamers.Ours is not akin to any postcolonial army that can be commanded from London or from Paris to go to the state house and remove leaders. It does not work like that with our army, he said.\n\nIn January Mnangagwa retired Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) commissioner Gen Godwin Matanga, replacing him with Stephen Mutamba.\n\nIn the same month he retired director-general Isaac Moyo from the spy agency, Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO), and in came Fulton Mangwanya.\n\nBut the biggest change came a week before the March 31 planned protests to remove the president from power.\n\nZimbabwe National Army (ZNA) commander Lt-Gen Anselem Sanyatwe, 69, was retired from the army to become minister of sport, arts and culture.\n\nHis replacement was Maj-Gen Emmanuel Matatu, 72.\n\nThe new-look ZRP, ZNA and CIO are near complete overhauls compared with when vice-president Chiwenga led the putsch that removed Robert Mugabe in November 2017, ushering in Mnangagwas regime.\n\n",

            "content": "Channel Africa\n\nZimbabwe has made remarkable progress in the fight against HIV/AIDS, as reported by the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS (UNAIDS).\n\nThe country has successfully reached the 95-95-95 targets, a global set of goals aimed at eliminating AIDS as a public health threat by 2030. The targets are designed to ensure that 95% of people living with HIV know their status, 95% of those diagnosed receive sustained antiretroviral therapy (ART), and 95% of those on treatment achieve viral suppression.\n\nCountries like Botswana, Eswatini, Rwanda, and Zimbabwe are among those leading the way in meeting these ambitious targets, providing hope and a model for the rest of the continent.\n\nPaul Caris Juru, the National Coordinator of the International Network of Religious Leaders Living with or Affected by HIV/AIDS in Zimbabwe, shared insights into how Zimbabwe achieved these gains. He attributed the countrys success to its unwavering commitment to ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030, despite ongoing economic challenges. Zimbabwes achievement of the 95-95-95 target is a proof to the countrys commitment to ending the AIDS pandemic by 2030, Juru said. Despite facing economic challenges, Zimbabwe has made significant strides in HIV prevention, treatment, and care.\n\nThe collective efforts of the government, international organisations, and civil society have been essential in expanding access to ART, improving HIV testing and diagnosis, and enhancing prevention efforts.\n\nWith over 10,000 healthcare facilities providing primary health services nationwide, Zimbabwe has successfully reached both urban and rural communities. Village health workers have been instrumental in raising awareness about HIV, and the government, alongside non-governmental organisations (NGOs), has implemented comprehensive awareness campaigns to educate the public on prevention and treatment.\n\nEven with limited resources, Zimbabwe has demonstrated that substantial progress is possible in tackling the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Even countries with limited resources, like Zimbabwe, can make significant strides in addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic, Juru noted. The countrys network of healthcare providers, especially in rural areas, has been key to reaching those in need of care and support.\n\nFaith communities have also played a critical role in supporting people living with HIV and challenging the stigma associated with the disease. Through organisations such as INERELA+, founded by Anglican pastor Gideon Byamugisha, the faith-based community has been instrumental in addressing stigma and providing care for those affected by HIV. Byamugisha, who was diagnosed with HIV and lost his wife to the disease, faced discrimination within the church and recognised the urgent need to break the silence surrounding HIV in faith communities.\n\nByamugisha and his colleagues founded INERELA+ in 2000, and the organisation has since become a prominent network across Africa, Europe, and Asia. The interfaith approach has been crucial in promoting a more inclusive response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Faith leaders who publicly share their HIV-positive status help reduce stigma and encourage others to seek treatment and support.\n\nThe success of Zimbabwes HIV/AIDS response can be attributed to the collaborative and multisectoral approach, which includes the involvement of the faith community, healthcare providers, international organisations, and local NGOs. The church has served as a safe space for counselling, education, and support for individuals living with HIV, offering a welcoming environment where people can access care without fear of discrimination.\n\nWhile Zimbabwe has made significant progress, Juru emphasised that the work is not yet complete. He urged that the country must remain vigilant and continue the fight to meet the ultimate goal of eliminating AIDS by 2030. The work is far from over. We must continue the fight to ensure that we achieve the ultimate goal of ending AIDS by 2030, Juru concluded.\n\nZimbabwes success in achieving the 95-95-95 target is a hopeful reminder of what can be accomplished through unity, dedication, and a commitment to addressing stigma and discrimination in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n\n",
