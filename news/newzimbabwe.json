No charges have been laid to date.\n\nAccording to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, directors are not prevented from leaving Australia while their company is in liquidation, as long as they continue cooperating with investigators.\n\nAdrian Mtungwazi left Australia after his business became insolvent.\n\nAn Australian Taxation Office spokesperson said in certain cases, directors could be issued an order preventing them leaving the country if they had significant debts, but would not confirm whether such an order was placed on Mr Mtungwazi.\n\nWhere specific circumstances are met, such as where there is a high risk of non-payment and alternate recovery options are limited, we may issue (these orders) to ensure taxpayers do not leave Australia without paying or making appropriate arrangements to pay outstanding debts, the spokesperson said.\n\nThe ATO is unable to comment [on Mr Mtungwazi] due to taxpayer confidentiality laws, and it would not be appropriate to comment on matters before the courts.\n\nAdachi was recognised by the Zimbabwe Association of WA.Credit:Linkedin\n\nSeparately, earlier this month, the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation escalated matters by personally suing Mr Mtungwazi, filing a writ with the WA Supreme Court seeking to recover what it claimed was more than A$3 million in Adachis unpaid tax and superannuation debts.\n\nAttempts by this masthead to contact Mr Mtungwazi for comment has not been successful.\n\nMs Mtungwazi has not provided a response for publication.\n\nThe couple established Adachi Disability Services in Perth in 2019 as a registered provider under the National Disability Insurance Scheme.\n\nThe organisation offered daily living assistance and services and, at its peak, employed about 300 staff, supporting 40 clients and operating from offices in Cannington, Gosnells and Maddington.\n\nIn 2021, Mr Mtungwazi was recognised by the Zimbabwe Association of WA with an Innovation and Entrepreneurship Award. On LinkedIn, a peer described him as an inspiration to many migrants  a proven visionary.\n\nWhile Adachi was unravelling, Mr Mtungwazi was projecting wealth. A video posted to social media two years ago shows Mr Mtungwazi standing in front of five sports cars, boasting about how many he owns.\n\nThese cars are worth a million dollars US, he tells the person filming.\n\nIve got another 40 cars  theres five here. But its hard work. You got to live life. You gotta do what you gotta do.\n\nBehind the rapid expansion and image of success, Yeos liquidation report claimed Adachi was drowning in debt and mismanagement.\n\nThe report said the company began facing regulatory issues in 2021, including audits and compliance concerns related to the mismanagement of client complaints.\n\nYeo said it was in his opinion that by August 2022, the company was insolvent, at which time it already owed about $4 million to the tax office, and it appeared to continue to accumulate millions in further debt.\n\nIn February 2024, the NDIS banned Adachi from providing care.\n\nAdachi won an award in 2024 despite owing millions in debt.\n\nBut a month later, the company was named Best Family-Run Care & Disability Services Company in Western Australia in the Asia Pacific Accreditation Cooperations Australian Enterprise awards.\n\nAPAC is an international organisation that helps countries in the Asia-Pacific trust each others certificates, so businesses dont have to repeat tests in other countries.\n\nYeo also alleged in his report the directors established new ventures under different names, including New Seasons Health Care Services and Daily Living Disability Services in Traralgon, Victoria  both in April, 2024  in what he described as an attempt to keep new businesses separated from the company.\n\nThe liquidator report states the directors had agreed to a payment plan with the ATO in 2023, but made only four instalments, before the Deputy Commissioner of Taxation issued a legal demand in November 2024.\n\nBy the time Adachi was wound up in May 2025, the company owed more than $6.4 million, with the bulk of claims to the ATO, but also to staff, Revenue WA, QBE Insurance and Optus, the liquidator report noted.\n\nMore than 80 employees were owed about $450,000 in unpaid wages and superannuation.\n\nThe liquidators report detailed how Adachi allegedly used a web of related companies to shuffle money and assets.\n\nYeo said at the time of his appointment in May, Adachi Disability Services was owed more than $8.6 million by associated entities, including A$6 million owed by Adachi Assets Pty Ltd.\n\nEffectively all assets utilised by the company in the conduct of its business were actually owned by Adachi Assets, even though the purchase of any assets were funded by income generated by the company, Yeo wrote.\n\nAmong these were numerous vehicles and properties, including a Ferrari, which Yeo said was purchased purely for the directors personal use.\n\nOn top of this, director loans to Adrian and Chiedza Mtungwazi totalled more than A$2.3 million, according to the report.\n\nMs Mtungwazi said these should be seen as salary substitutes, but Yeo said he strongly disagreed with that reasoning.\n\nYeo also found $335,000 was transferred to South Africa, the UK, Philippines and Zimbabwe, between 2022-24.\n\nHe said Adachis money was even used to establish a Zimbabwean football club, Adachi FC, and to purchase property in Bulawayo, including the Morningside Shops for A$1.3 million. Bulawayo is listed as the birthplace for the directors on their ASIC record.\n\nA liquidator has the ability to investigate potential offences that may have been committed by directors and submit a report to ASIC.\n\nIf the liquidator alleges there have been breaches, ASIC can investigate and lay civil charges, or refer the case to the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, if criminal charges are warranted.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has ordered Arosume Property Development (Pvt) Ltd to be joined in a bitter property dispute involving businesswoman Farai Olivia Mashonganyika and the Minister of Local Government, ruling that the developer has a direct and substantial interest in the contested Carrick Creagh land.\n\nDelivering judgment on September 5, 2025, Justice Siyabona Musithu said, The applicant not only has a substantial interest in the issues raised in HCH 884/24 concerning the property, but the applicants rights in the said property will be affected by any judgment that may be rendered without its involvement.\n\nHe said that excluding Arosume from the ongoing litigation would risk an incomplete determination of the matter.\n\nRule 32(12) bestows upon the court the discretion to order any person whose presence before the court is necessary to ensure that all issues in dispute may be effectually and completely determined, he said.\n\nThe case centres on stand 91 Kidron Valley Road, Carrick Creagh Estate, Borrowdale, transferred to Mashonganyika under Deed of Transfer 5690/2011. In 2022, the Ministry of Local Government moved to cancel her title deed, accusing her of failing to pay over US$520,195 in development costs and claiming she was not a member of the Sally Mugabe Housing Cooperative, which was part of the project.\n\nArosume, the developer in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) with the State and the cooperative, argued it was deliberately excluded when Mashonganyika filed a review application challenging the ministrys cancellation order. The firm alleged that the deed was fraudulently obtained and that it had already filed an urgent application to block Mashonganyika from building on the land.\n\nMashonganyika, however, insists she bought the property legitimately in 2011, paying US$4,000 directly to the ministry after previously being misled by Arosume to part with US$10,000. She maintains the government acted unlawfully by cancelling her deed without a court order.\n\nA deed of transfer confers real rights of ownership which cannot be terminated without a court order, she argued in her opposing affidavit.\n\nShe further accused the ministry of acting at Arosumes behest, alleging connivance between the developer and government to wrestle away her property.\n\nJustice Musithu dismissed her objections, finding that Arosumes interest arose from the tripartite PPP agreement governing Carrick Creagh. He noted that Mashonganyika herself had acknowledged the existence of a dispute with the developer in earlier court filings.\n\nThe dispute is much broader than the mere administrative process that the first respondent claims she wants regularised, the judge said. Any judgment affecting the property will also impact the developers rights under the tripartite arrangement.\n\nThe court granted Arosumes joinder, directing the company to file its opposing papers in the main matter (HCH 884/24) within five days. The question of costs was deferred to that case.\n\nThe ruling paves the way for a full trial in which the High Court will weigh competing claims of fraud, non-payment, and unlawful cancellation in one of Harares most high-profile land battles.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has ruled in favour of Harare resident Cephas Tapiwa Muneri, declaring him the rightful holder of rights and interests in a contested Haydon Park stand, after a protracted legal battle with Delatfin Civil Engineering and controversial land developer Felix Munyaradzi.\n\nIn a judgment delivered on September 8, Justice Siyabona Musithu declared that Muneri is the lawful owner of Stand 1650, Haydon Park, Sandton, measuring 1,097 square metres, and blocked attempts by Munyaradzis firm to repossess the property.\n\nThe applicant is hereby declared the lawful holder of rights and interests in Stand Number 1650 Haydon Park, Sandton, ruled Justice Musithu. The attempt by the first and second respondents to repossess the stand from the applicant is hereby declared unlawful.\n\nMuneri bought the property in 2017 through Rawson Properties, later formalising the deal directly with Delatfin Civil Engineering, represented by Munyaradzi. He paid all fees, including a US$650 regularisation charge to Zvimba Rural District Council, and had been living at the property since 2017.\n\nBut in December 2024, Muneri was shocked to see a public notice threatening repossession unless he paid for the land again, this time at US$55 per square metre.\n\nDelatfin argued it had never received the original purchase price, claiming the money was misappropriated by rogue employees, including convicted fraudster Saymore Mutakura.\n\nMuneri insisted he had done his due diligence and dealt directly with Munyaradzi, who personally signed off on the agreements. He accused the company of trying to extort him, telling the court: The alleged fraud was an internal matter to be resolved between the first respondent and its employee. I cannot be made to pay for the property twice.\n\nJustice Musithu rejected Delatfins defence, noting that Munyaradzi had signed the agreements himself and never moved to invalidate them.\n\nMerely denying their legality in an opposing affidavit did not have the desired effect of nullifying them, the judge said. The first respondents arguments were ill-conceived for as long as no attempt was made to have the agreements declared null and void.\n\nThe court found Muneri had demonstrated a direct and substantial interest in the property, and that his rights were under threat from what it described as unlawful attempts to repossess.\n\nThe High Court ordered Zvimba Rural District Council to officially register Muneri as the lawful rights holder, and directed Delatfin to pay his legal costs.\n\nThe ruling is the latest twist in Zimbabwes long-running land disputes involving private developers and residents who often face double allocations, fraudulent sales, or threats of repossession years after purchase.\n\n",
