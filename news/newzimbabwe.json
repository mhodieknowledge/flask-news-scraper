            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nOutspoken former legislator Temba Mliswa has sensationally declared businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei as President Emmerson Mnangagwas natural successor, dismissing Vice President Constantino Chiwengas chances of ever taking over.\n\nIn a leaked audio of a phone conversation between Mliswa and controversial businessman Agrippa Bopela Masiyakurima, secretly recorded by the latter, Mliswa argued that Chiwenga is being misled by his wife, Miniyothabo Baloyi, into believing he still commands enough military influence to claim the presidency.\n\nMliswa, once a fierce critic of Tagwirei, defended his change of stance by insisting he has no permanent enemies but only permanent interests.\n\nThe person who is going to take over from Mnangagwa is someone he trusts, who will protect his interests, Tagwirei, said Mliswa.\n\nSocial media does not install a leader. To tell you the truth, I know how you feel about Mnangagwa but we cannot have permanent enemies, we should have permanent interests. Who does not eat, everyone is doing so.\n\nWalk with the father who is there, not a step-father. Chiwenga is a stepfather. We will lose deals because of things that do not matter, you are business people, you must look at things that make you money.\n\nBoth Masiyakurima and Mliswa appeared to agree on Tagwireis succession prospects, with Masiyakurima adding that he could never support Mnangagwa because of a failed US$5 million business deal between them.\n\nMliswa accused Chiwenga of corruption and pursuing personal vendettas, even over trivial issues such as unreceived wedding gifts.\n\nOnce considered the most powerful man in Zimbabwe after leading the November 2017 military intervention that toppled the late Robert Mugabe and ushered in Mnangagwa, Chiwenga is now widely viewed as having lost influence since retiring from the army to assume the role of deputy president.\n\nDespite perceptions that the military has shifted allegiance to the MnangagwaTagwirei faction within Zanu PF, Chiwenga reportedly still believes he retains significant sway.\n\nAdded Mliswa: There is no longer any opposition in Zanu PF, they are headed to a conference with Mnangagwa tightly holding onto power, there is no coup that will ever happen in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe cars that were given to the military came from Tagwirei with Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) Commander Phillip Valerio Sibanda saluting, remember Valerio is from ZIPRA, not ZANLA.\n\nChiwenga will never direct operations for the army, that will never happen. He removed his uniform. That man is being misled by his wife, he should remember that he no longer wears a uniform.\n\nBaloyi, a serving Colonel, has in recent months stepped up her public presence, which analysts view as part of both her own rebranding and that of the Chiwenga family. This comes as the Mnangagwa administration continues to face criticism over alleged corruption, ruthless tactics, and an expanding grip on key economic sectors such as mining.\n\n",

            "content": "The Conversation\n\nZimbabwean writerNoViolet Bulawayohas beenhonouredas Africas best short story writer after winning theBest of Caine Award. The special recognition marks 25 years of the annualCaine Prize for African Writing.\n\nAn esteemed panel of judges unanimously selected Bulawayo as the standout winner of the 25 stories awarded the prize so far. Her short story,Hitting Budapest, won the prize in 2011. She has gone on to publish two acclaimed novels,We Need New NamesandGlory. Both were shortlisted for the Booker Prize.\n\nFor me as ascholarof African literary cultures, Bulawayos recognition by the judges feels like a generational milestone. Hitting Budapest follows a band of children wandering in a decaying urban landscape in search of food. Their journey, told through a fractured, childlike voice, captures both the immediacy of play and the stark realities of deprivation.\n\nThe storys unsettling blend of innocence and brutality provoked livelydebatewhen it appeared. It raised questions about the aesthetics of the African literature the prize sought to celebrate. About whether its power lived in its inventive narration and perspective, or whether it leaned too easily into global appetites for African suffering and spectacle.\n\nBut there was never any doubt about Bulawayos singular talent. Shes today known for her virtuoso ability with language and her sharp eye for the textures of African life.\n\nNoViolet Bulawayo, the pen name of Elizabeth Tshele, was born in 1981 in Tsholotsho, Zimbabwe. She grew up in the city of Bulawayo, from which she takes part of her literary name. NoViolet is in honour of her late mother, Violet. She later moved to the US, where she studied and began her writing career.\n\nIn 2013, her debut novel We Need New Names announced her arrival as a major talent. Its sharp social observation, childlike candour, and lyrical experimentation made it both accessible and unsettling. Her Caine Prize story makes up the first chapter of this book.\n\nA decade later,Gloryconfirmed her daring imagination. Set in an allegorical animal kingdom, it transforms Zimbabwes turbulent politics into a fable of authoritarianism and resistance. Its inventive form  mixing satire, oral traditions, and digital-age idioms  reimagines how the novel can respond to todays African realities.\n\nTogether, these works have marked Bulawayo as a defining voice of her generation. She isnt afraid to stretch the form of the African novel while capturing the hopes and contradictions of our times.\n\nSince its inauguration in 2000, theCaine Prize for African Writinghas set itself a lofty goal: to identify and celebrate a new generation of African writers.\n\nWhen the first-ever prize was awarded to acclaimed Sudanese writerLeila Aboulelathat year, it signalled a shift: the new African writers were not just beholden to writing back to colonial history, they wrote from the urgency of their own moment.\n\nManypast Caine winnershave gone on to make enduring contributions to African literature.Binyavanga Wainaina,Helon Habila,Yvonne Adhiambo Owuor,Brian Chikwava,Mary Watson, among others. Their work shows how the prize has provided a platform for innovative writing that unsettles conventions and shifts the contours of the field.\n\nOn average more than 200 entries are received each year, and significantly, more women than men have won the prize. This is notable compared to the heavily male-dominatedAfrican Writers Seriesgeneration of the 1960s. These included literary powerhouses LikeChinua Achebe,Wole SoyinkaandNgg wa Thiongo.\n\nUnlike many other prizes, the Caine made a decision early on to accept entries frominternet publications. This proved prescient. Online platforms have inspired a boom in short stories. The art form has links with age-old traditions of storytelling in Africa and seems particularly suited to the pace of contemporary living.\n\nBeyond the award, the Caine Prize has hosted annual writing workshops in various African cities, helping to nurture local literary communities. Its award ceremonies have been accompanied by efforts to ensure the stories remain accessible to African readers.\n\nToday, more than a dozen African co-publishers distribute the Caine Prize anthologies. These books include each years shortlisted stories and workshop entries.\n\nFor much of its history, the Caine Prize has championed the African short story written in English, by writers based either on the continent or abroad. This has not been without controversy, especiallydebatesabout who counts as an African writer, and why the prize is based in the UK rather than Africa.\n\nIf anything, the prize has forced readers to think harder about who belongs to an African literary community, and who gets left out when boundaries are drawn too tightly. The true currency of prizes is recognition, and in this sense the Caine has often exceeded expectations by bringing visibility to writers who might not otherwise have reached global audiences.\n\nControversies endure. The prizes location in Europe, its emphasis on the short story form, andits rolein shaping global perceptions of African literature all remain points of contention.\n\nEven with that noise in the background, the Caine Prize remains the only freestanding and consistent award dedicated solely to African writing. That distinction alone has made it the preeminent platform for new African voices in the 2000s.\n\nBulawayos crowning as the best of the lot underscores both the continuity and the evolution of the prize. All the winners embody or react against African political and social contexts, at the same time addressing issues of race, identity, sexuality and historical injustices.\n\nThe Caine Prize has been an imperfect but vital incentive for a new generation of African writers and their often politically charged perspectives. It has sparked robust discourse, created opportunities, and amplified voices that might have been overlooked. It has become a cultural institution to be reckoned with and arguably the most influential global event for African literature.\n\nAnd in celebrating NoViolet Bulawayo at its 25-year mark, it affirms what many already knew: she is a generational talent, one whose work will resonate far beyond the prize itself.\n\nAssistant Professor, Harvard University\n\n",

We had seeds that had gone extinct, but now they have been revived, thanks to seed exchanges. If my crop fails due to drought or other reasons, I can always get the seed from other farmers, he said.\n\nA farmer shows her agricultural products at a seed and food festival in Harare, Zimbabwe, Sept. 20, 2025.(Xinhua/Tafara Mugwara)\n\nChinyoka added that smallholder farmers should not be at the periphery of food production, but rather be at the forefront to effectively safeguard food security.\n\nArchbold Sasa, a lecturer in the Department of Crop Science at the Marondera University of Agricultural Sciences and Technology in Zimbabwe, said smallholder farmers are key to promoting food security and resilience.\n\nSmallholder farmers play a crucial role in storing some seed varieties because they keep producing them from time to time, so that we dont lose that genetic material as a country. Its sort of a seed bank, he said. Some crops are being neglected, and people are not producing them anymore, but we tend to find those seeds in smallholder farmers.\n\nIn addition to indigenous grains, farmers are encouraged to adopt indigenous vegetables, including blackjack, pigweed, okra, and pumpkin leaves, due to their high nutritional value and adaptation to local climates.\n\nWe are doing seed exchange from one district to another so that people will have a diversity of these indigenous vegetables to promote their nutrition, resulting in improved health, said Sasa.\n\n",
