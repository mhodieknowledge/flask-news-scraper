            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nBARELY a week after three unidentified men stormed Heart and Soul (HSTV) premises in Harare looking for journalist Blessed Mhlanga, the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has summoned him alleging that he contravened Section 164 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, Chapter 9:23.\n\nIn a statement Friday, police appealed for information on the location of Mhlanga, stating that they were keen to interview him.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police is seeking information on the location and subsequent interview of journalist Blessed Mhlanga. This is in connection with allegation of contravening Section 164 of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act, Chapter 9:23.\n\nAnyone with information should contact any nearest police station or the National Complaints Desk, part of the statement reads.\n\nHowever, Mhlanga said he is not on the run but is unwell.\n\nHaving read the police statement, having presented myself twice after being requested, I have called Commissioner Nyathi and assured him that I will be at CID by 9 am on Monday as I am currently unwell. I am not on the run. I have always complied to lawful orders, Mhlanga wrote on his X account Friday.\n\nThis is the third time in a month that police have summoned Mhlanga over unclear matters.\n\nInitially, the police accused Mhlanga of assaulting former deputy minister of finance Terence Mukupe sometime in 2018. In that case, Mhlanga was, in fact, the victim. It seems the police were barking up the wrong tree.\n\nOn the second occasion, the police summoned Mhlanga and withdrew their summons without offering a reason.\n\nIt was after this second summons that President Emmerson Mnangagwas spokesperson and deputy chief secretary to the Office of The President and Cabinet, George Charamba, said he had engaged and called police boss Stephen Mutamba to resolve the matter on behalf of Mhlanga.\n\nWhen the matter was drawn to my attention on Monday, I engaged the Police Commissioner General who was quick to look into the matter. We thank the police for this. At the same time, we continue to urge our journalists to act within the law.\n\nIt is common cause that a person on police wanted-list ceases to be a legitimate interviewee until after he is cleared, Charamba wrote on his pseudo X account trading as Dhonzamusoro.\n\nThe Media Institute of Southern Africa (MISA) have raised concerns over the safety of journalists after three unidentified men, who claimed to be police officers armed with pistols, stormed HSTV premises in Harare looking for Mhlanga. This incident suggests something fishy is going on.\n\nMhlanga claimed that soon after the incident, he received a call from the police CID Law and Order Section inviting him for questioning. His lawyer, Chris Mhike, engaged the police, who then said the summons had been withdrawn.\n\nPolice interest in Mhlanga developed after he granted firebrand and fearless war veteran, Blessed Runesu Geza, exclusive interviews and press briefings in which the Zanu PF Central Committee member called for President Emmerson Mnangagwa to step down.\n\nGeza accused Mnangagwa of failing to nip corruption in the bud, nepotism after biased appointments of relatives to key government and party positions, and for failing to lead the economic revival in the wake of company closures and job losses for many.\n\nGeza charged that if Mnangagwa fails to step down peacefully, the masses will use the Constitution to remove him from office, rekindling memories of the November 2017 military takeover from the late and former President Robert Mugabe.\n\n",

            "content": "UNICEF\n\nPublic health emergencies, including outbreaks of cholera, mpox and, more recently, viral haemorrhagic fevers, are posing significant threats to the safety and wellbeing of millions of children in Eastern and Southern Africa, UNICEF has said.\n\nThe high number of health crises, often worsened by climate shocks, is impacting already vulnerable communities and compounding risks to children in the region.\n\nThe alarming frequency of public health emergencies and disease outbreaks in the region is disrupting vital safety nets for children and stripping away their right to a safe and nurturing environment, said UNICEF Regional Director for Eastern and Southern Africa, Etleva Kadilli. Global and regional stakeholders must come together to fortify protection systems offered by families, communities and state services to ensure every child can thrive, even in the face of multiple challenges.\n\nIn 2025, 17 countries in Eastern and Southern Africa are grappling with multiple public health emergencies, the majority of which are outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases such as polio, measles and diphtheria. Years of stagnating and declining immunization rates across many countries in the region have resulted in a resurgence of these preventable diseases.\n\nThe region is experiencing major outbreaks of viral haemorrhagic fevers, including Marburg virus disease in Tanzania and Ebola disease caused by the Sudan virus in Uganda. Additionally, mpox continues to be a significant health concern, particularly in Burundi and Uganda, with risks of cross-border transmission due to high levels of population movement.\n\nFurthermore, cholera is currently affecting 12 countries, including Angola, Burundi, South Sudan, Zambia, and Zimbabwe, with the region recording the highest number of cholera and acute watery diarrhoea deaths globally.\n\nChildren are inherently more vulnerable to the physical impacts of these diseases due to their developing immune systems and unique physiological characteristics. The risks are even greater for children suffering from malnutrition.\n\nAdditionally, when a family member falls ill, children are more likely to experience psychological distress and are at greater risk of abuse, violence or even child labor as a survival strategy for families that have been impacted.\n\nThe risks to children, especially girls  who are often responsible for caring for affected family members  are growing as multiple crises converge.During public health emergencies, women and girls are often at increased risk of sexual abuse, violence and exploitation due to family separation, disruption of social services such as education and healthcare, and increased economic vulnerability.\n\nThese concurrent and often cyclical emergencies are straining response capacities, undermining important gains in strengthening social services.\n\nIn addition to providing essential supplies, working with communities and supporting access to education, health, nutrition, as well as water and sanitation, UNICEF is working across the region to protect children from abuse, exploitation and violence.\n\nEfforts include:\n\nUNICEF is also working to ensure the continuation of essential services for children in a manner that is safe, respectful and dignified for girls and boys of all ages, including children with disabilities and other vulnerable groups. However, given the scale of public health emergencies, increased funding and international support remain critical.\n\nIn any emergency, children and the most vulnerable suffer the most, said Kadilli. Aside from investments in essential infrastructure and services, promoting routine immunization and addressing the social determinants of health, sustained funding for protection efforts must continue to be prioritised to support the overall wellbeing of children in the region.\n\n",

            "content": "By Dr. Richard Dune\n\nHow technology is transforming compliance, reducing costs, and improving care quality.\n\nGovernance and compliance are the backbone of high-quality health and social care services. These frameworks ensure patient safety, workforce accountability, and regulatory alignment. However, many organisations still rely on outdated systems, leading to inefficiencies, compliance risks, and increased costs.\n\nIn an environment where the Care Quality Commission (CQC) and Ofsted regulations are becoming more stringent, manual and fragmented governance processes can create unnecessary burdens. These inefficiencies affect compliance teams and service quality, workforce retention, and ultimately, patient and service user outcomes.\n\nDrawing from my PhD research on Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) and the development of ComplyPlus, this article explores how technology can transform governance and compliance in health and social care. With the right tools, organisations can simplify compliance workflows, improve decision-making, and create a culture of excellence.\n\nHealth and social care organisations operate in a complex regulatory environment, yet many rely on disjointed governance and compliance systems that create:\n\nThese issues go beyond operational inefficiencies. They undermine the fundamental purpose of health and social care: delivering high-quality, person-centred services.\n\nMany organisations use multiple platforms to manage governance, audits, and workforce compliance. This results in duplicate efforts and inconsistencies, forcing teams to consolidate data manually.\n\nFor example:\n\nPoorly integrated systems increase compliance costs. Many organisations spend thousands on external consultants to manage regulatory paperwork, audits, and training compliance tracking.\n\nWithout automation, organisations must hire additional staff to manually oversee compliance, significantly increasing operational expenses.\n\nCompliance should support frontline teams, not burden them with excessive administrative tasks. However, inefficient compliance processes:\n\nThe good news is that technology can solve many of these challenges, streamlining governance while ensuring organisations meet and exceed CQC and Ofsted standards.\n\nFrom automating workflows to improving audit readiness, compliance-focused digital tools reduce administrative burdens and enhance service quality.\n\nClinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) help clinicians make evidence-based decisions, ensuring alignment with best practices and regulatory requirements.\n\nKey Benefits of CDSS in Governance and Compliance:\n\nMy PhD research on CDSS confirmed that when implemented effectively, these systems improve patient outcomes, reduce risk, and enhance regulatory compliance.\n\nComplyPlus builds on the principles of CDSS, extending them into broader compliance and governance frameworks.\n\nDesigned as an integrated regulatory compliance platform, ComplyPlus tackles the root causes of inefficiencies by:\n\nOrganisations thatimplement ComplyPlushave reported:\n\nTo truly understand the power of compliance-focused technology, lets explore some real-world case studies showcasing the impact of ComplyPlus.\n\nThe challenge: Domiciliary care providers struggled to maintain accurate staff training records using spreadsheets, leading to missed deadlines and frequent audit errors.\n\nThe solution: ComplyPlus automated training reminders and consolidated policy management, ensuring real-time compliance tracking.\n\nThe results:\n\n 90%+ reduction in training-related errors. Zero compliance issues in their latest CQC audit. Freed up staff time, allowing more focus on delivering care.\n\nThe challenge: A care home faced high staff turnover, with employees citing administrative burdens as a key reason for leaving.\n\nThe solution: ComplyPlus simplified compliance workflows, reducing paperwork frustrations.\n\nThe results:\n\n Administrative tasks reduced by over 40%, improving job satisfaction. At least a 25% increase in staff retention within a year.\n\nThe challenge: A private hospital aimed for an Outstanding rating from the CQC but struggled with fragmented compliance processes.\n\nThe solution: ComplyPlus provided a centralised platform for policies, training, and audits, aligning their operations with the new Single Assessment Framework.\n\nThe results:\n\n The hospital achieved an Outstanding rating, with leadership and governance cited as a key strength. Patient satisfaction improved because staff had more time to focus on care delivery.\n\nThe governance and compliance challenges in health and social care are significant, but they are not insurmountable. Technology provides a powerful pathway to streamlining compliance, reducing costs, and improving service quality.\n\nWith decades of experience in clinical practice, research, and entrepreneurship, I have seen firsthand how compliance-focused digital solutions like ComplyPlus can transform governance in health and social care. Organisations that embrace technology now will be better positioned to meet regulatory demands, enhance operational efficiency, and deliver outstanding care.\n\nAtLearnPac Systems, we developed ComplyPlus to help health and social care organisations navigate compliance more effectively.\n\n Monitor real-time regulatory changes to stay aligned with CQC, Ofsted, GDPR, and NHS requirements. Automate workforce compliance tracking, including statutory and mandatory training. Streamline audits, policy management, and reportingreducing administrative workload.\n\nDr Richard Dune is the CEO of LearnPac Systems, a leading UK provider of edtech and compliance software solutions for regulated sectors.

I was in various tournaments in different positions, so I know the different points which can affect performance.\n\nBut let me be honest, I think this AFCON will be very well organized and definitely fair.\n\nWe have about 11 months to prepare and we will plan accordingly, and we will try our best.

First, the preparation is divided into organizational and sporting aspects.\n\nFrom an organizational standpoint, this is a huge advantage. Everything is already well-prepared, with team-based camps and hotels arranged, so in a way, theres not much we can influence in that regard.\n\nThe Warriors were disqualified from the 2023 Africa Cup of Nations in Cte dIvoire due to a FIFA suspension.

He went on to train baristas, which he says was an important opportunity to uplift people and develop skills that would, ultimately, lead to work opportunities.\n\nIn 2020, he opened Coffee LAB, which was almost an immediate hit. However, this extremely modest entrepreneur believes the value of good coffee does not remain in the cup. Coffee brings people together. It connects them. When I make coffee, Im able to engage in and build relationships with them through my coffee. I love people, he says.\n\nAsked how he was drawn to coffee, Nkolothi says: The funny thing is coffee found me  it was a surprise. I started in 2010 as a barista at Mama Lucianas. It was my big coffee break and there was this big coffee machine and I was the guy. The coffee was just giving me peace and love and connecting me with people ever since.\n\nHe then started a facebook page to learn more and connect with coffee professionals all over the world. Everything started to shape up. I was understanding what coffee was all about, training myself, and communicating with people. Coffee is more about character.\n\nAttitude is everything. You can be the best barista in the world but if your character is not right, you are not authentic.\n\nHe soon started training other baristas.\n\nThe Coffee Lab was a dream. It was never meant to be a coffee shop, but more a coffee cabin, he says. Retrenched in 2020, he got a call from the art gallery to open in the foyer. When something is meant to be, its meant to be, Nkolothi says. Up until today coffee has been a passion.\n\nNkolothi has three young girls and loves reading. He also loves it when people drop by to watch football. Hes a Liverpool fan.\n\nThe first runner up in the Battle of the Beans was Lineage, Hillcrest whose owner, Craig Charity, has been at the forefront of coffee roasting and making in KZN for over a decade.\n\nThe second runner up was another relative newcomer to the industry, Skyline Salt Rock. Originally the coffee shop was part of Skyline Coffee Roasters in Morningside but new owner, Darren Lewis, bought the shop in 2023. He says he bought the venue due to its great community spirit. He was a former regional manager for Vida e in KZN.\n\nA good coffee shop is about serving consistently good coffee and food, knowing every regulars coffee order and name. We have over 100 regulars who come to the store five to six times a week, he says.\n\nTop barista was Keagon Chavoos from Crane Flower Coffee in Kloof.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nTURNER farm residents in Mt Hampden, who are facing displacement to pave way for the development of the new multi-million-dollar Zim Cyber City project, 26 kilometres northwest of Harare, are appealing to the government to provide a clear timeline for their relocation.\n\nThe displacement will affect thousands of residents, but the affected persons say the uncertainty is hindering them from making long-term plans.\n\nThe cyber city, estimated to cost around US$60 billion when complete, will be part of Zimbabwes proposed new administrative capital, also known as New Harare.\n\nAs a precursor to the evictions, the government unilaterally exhumed about 1 000 graves between June and August last year, to pave way for the project.\n\nThe cyber city is being developed by United Arab Emirates-based industrial conglomerate Mulk International, which has injected an initial US$500 million.\n\nAn investigation conducted by NewZimbabwe.com, in conjunction with Information for Development Trust last year, revealed the community was in panic and fear as it faced eviction, relocation uncertainty, and job losses.\n\nThe residents, many of whom have lived in the area for decades have nowhere else to go.\n\nTamira Rufaso (40) said she and other residents were anxious because they do not know what lies ahead for them.\n\nWe are just hanging, waiting for something to happen, we are living on the edge, she said.\n\nThe Ministry of Local Government last year told this publication that affected residents would be moved by mid-2025 and that the government would find them a place to settle.\n\nResidents however say they have not been formally informed of the relocation.\n\nCosmas Mandipwanya, who has been living in Mt Hampden since 1994, pleaded with the government to communicate its position.\n\nWe are pleading with the government to at least give us enough information. They should give us the timelines so that we know when we are leaving and where we are going so that we can plan using the governments calendar, he said.\n\nRight now, I cannot even do a six-month or one-year project because we are scared that anytime we may be evicted.\n\nKungonzwa mota ichiuya wakutofunga kuti wavingwa kuzodzingwa (each time you see a vehicle approaching,you think they have come to evict you), he said.\n\nAnother resident, Amos Basi (48), said residents cant plan.\n\nWe are waiting to hear from the government. We have children to provide for, and right now we cannot even plan for the future. We cant even do our small projects like chicken rearing or gardens Basi said.\n\nResidents also said they were anxious about the impact the evictions would have on their childrens education.\n\nI have grandchildren in exam classes, some in primary school and another one in secondary school, and I am scared that we may get evicted before they write exams. If that happens, what will I do with them? Where will they go and learn?\n\nEphraim Kurushiwe (62), who has called Mt Hampden home since 1997, said his biggest fear is the risk of being homeless at an old age.\n\nI am asking the government to give us accommodation when they move us, he said.\n\nMeanwhile, President Emmerson Mnangagwas spokesperson, George Charamba, dismissed the residents plight on one of his X handle in November last year.\n\nSome stories hadzina mushumo, (are useless). Imagine a story featuring one seemingly distressed farm laborer standing in front of some dingy tenement of one room, all against a headline which says, thousands in distress from displacement by proposed Cyber City!\n\nThe solution implied in the article is that the Cyber City, which, like all cities, will house millions, has to wait for the sake of this wretch and his equally wretched tenement.\n\nTinombofungawo here tisati tanyora zvinyaya zvedu, nhai vanyori nevapepeti venhau (do you think before writing your stories) or we just believe in obstructive journalism, however stupid and futile? Charamba wrote.\n\nEfforts to get a comment from the local government ministry were fruitless. The ministrys spokesperson Gabriel Masvora kept saying he was looking for the information.\n\nMost of the affected residents have no other place to go, as they are mainly children of deceased farm workers originally from Mozambique, Malawi, and Zambia, with some from Zimbabwe.\n\nBetween the early 1900s and the mid-1960s, a significant number of people migrated from Malawi (then known as Nyasaland) to Zimbabwe (then Rhodesia) for various reasons, including the pursuit of higher-paying jobs.\n\nNyasaland, like Zimbabwe, was a British colony but was more densely populated and less economically developed. This economic disparity prompted many to move in search of better employment opportunities.\n\nDuring the same era, Zimbabwe also drew labourers from Mozambique and Zambia.\n\n",
