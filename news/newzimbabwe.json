            "content": "By Xinhua\n\nZIMBABWE, one of Africas largest tobacco producers, aims to leverage its booming trade with China to increase tobacco production and promote value addition, a senior government official has said.\n\nMinister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Anxious Masuka made the remarks Thursday on the sidelines of the Zimbabwe-China Tobacco Expo, which opened the same day in Harare, the countrys capital.The two-day event brought together Zimbabwean, Chinese and other global industry stakeholders to discuss ways to enhance tobacco production, processing and value addition.Masuka said that after achieving a record tobacco output of 355 million kilograms this year, Zimbabwe now aims to process 100 million kilograms of the locally produced crop through partnerships with China.China is the biggest export market for Zimbabwean tobacco. We hope that will remain the case in the future, which is why, as we discuss increasing volumes, we have chosen to walk together with them to reach our goal of 500 million kilograms, said Masuka.While about 10 percent of Zimbabwes tobacco leaf is currently processed locally, less than one percent is made into cigarettes, a market segment Zimbabwe now seeks to enter, Masuka said.Through collaboration with China, Zimbabwe aims to ensure that the bulk of its tobacco is processed locally to create jobs, boost export earnings and strengthen the countrys industrial base, he said.Masuka added that Zimbabwe could also benefit from acquiring advanced cigarette manufacturing equipment from China to further enhance value addition and beneficiation.Patrick Devenish, chairman of the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board, said China has long been a pillar of Zimbabwes tobacco trade. He said that Zimbabwe now seeks to explore the vast Chinese market by exporting locally manufactured cigarettes to one of the worlds largest cigarette consumer markets.Cigarettes are all about branding and finding markets for those brands. The biggest market for cigarettes in the world is China. So, if we can work with China to produce more of their cigarettes, that will be better for us, and hopefully for them too, Devenish said.China has the technology, capital and experience, while Zimbabwe has raw materials, skilled farmers, land and policy support for quality tobacco production. Together, the two countries can establish joint ventures in cigarette manufacturing, nicotine extraction, shisha production and alternative tobacco product processing, he said.Devenish also noted that Zimbabwes value addition drive faces challenges, including limited access to affordable long-term financing, underutilized factory capacity and outdated equipment. Collaboration with Chinese partners, he said, could help bridge those gaps.Celani Sithole, sales and marketing manager at the Tobacco Sales Floor, one of Zimbabwes leading tobacco auction platforms, expressed optimism about increasing partnerships with China.I am looking forward to seeing more Chinese businesses participating on our tobacco platform, Sithole said.\n\nMinister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development Anxious Masuka made the remarks Thursday on the sidelines of the Zimbabwe-China Tobacco Expo, which opened the same day in Harare, the countrys capital.\n\nThe two-day event brought together Zimbabwean, Chinese and other global industry stakeholders to discuss ways to enhance tobacco production, processing and value addition.Masuka said that after achieving a record tobacco output of 355 million kilograms this year, Zimbabwe now aims to process 100 million kilograms of the locally produced crop through partnerships with China.China is the biggest export market for Zimbabwean tobacco.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has overturned the 20-year jail term imposed on a Mudzi man, William Smoko, who had been convicted of rape, blasting the lower court for convicting him on speculative, contradictory, and uncorroborated evidence.\n\nIn a recent judgment delivered by judges of appeal, Justices Esther Muremba and Deputy Judge President Munyaradzi Mawadze, the High Court found that the State had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, ruling that the complainants story was riddled with inconsistencies and credibility gaps.I am unable to conclude that the State proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, Muremba ruled.She added that the magistrates analysis fell far short of the rigorous scrutiny required in criminal trials where the liberty of an accused person is at stake.Smoko had been convicted of raping a 34-year-old woman from a neighbouring village following a long-running feud over a faulty cellphone and a missing shovel. The alleged incident was said to have occurred after the woman accused Smoko of cheating her in a phone swap deal and later of stealing gold ore from her husbands artisanal mining venture.But the High Court said these prior disputes cast serious doubt on the complainants motives.These circumstances cast a shadow over her motives and raise legitimate concerns about possible fabrication of the rape allegations, Muremba said.The court described the complainants version as both contradictory and implausible, noting that she claimed Smoko assaulted her in broad daylight, reported him to the police, and yet chose to sleep alone with only a three-year-old child that same night despite fearing his return.The absence of any meaningful explanation for these decisions raises serious doubts about the reliability of her version of events, the judge said.Muremba further criticised the magistrate for relying on unverified assumptions.At no point during the trial did the accused admit to visiting the complainants homestead on the date in question It was therefore incorrect for the learned regional magistrate to conclude that it was common cause that the accused had gone to the complainants homestead.The judge also faulted the State for failing to produce key evidence, including the torn clothing the complainant claimed had been ripped during the alleged assault.The absence of such physical evidence, particularly when its existence is explicitly claimed, significantly undermines the credibility of the complainants testimony, she ruled.On the medical findings, Justice Muremba noted that the report only showed healed hymenal tears inconsistent with a recent sexual assault and that the bruises could not conclusively be linked to the alleged rape.The High Court found that the magistrate had wrongly dismissed the defence evidence, including that of Smokos wife, who testified that her husband was at home on the night of the alleged attack.The courts conclusion that the accuseds wife had placed him at the complainants homestead is speculative and unsupported by the evidence.The court then ruled that the inconsistencies, contradictions, and lack of corroboration rendered the conviction unsafe.A conviction must rest on evidence that is persuasive and free from reasonable doubt.That is not the case here.The liberty of the accused is at stake. The credibility of the complainant must be evaluated in light of all relevant circumstances, including any potential motive to mislead.Smokos conviction and sentence were accordingly set aside.\n\nIn a recent judgment delivered by judges of appeal, Justices Esther Muremba and Deputy Judge President Munyaradzi Mawadze, the High Court found that the State had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, ruling that the complainants story was riddled with inconsistencies and credibility gaps.\n\nI am unable to conclude that the State proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, Muremba ruled.She added that the magistrates analysis fell far short of the rigorous scrutiny required in criminal trials where the liberty of an accused person is at stake.Smoko had been convicted of raping a 34-year-old woman from a neighbouring village following a long-running feud over a faulty cellphone and a missing shovel.

The credibility of the complainant must be evaluated in light of all relevant circumstances, including any potential motive to mislead.Smokos conviction and sentence were accordingly set aside.\n\nBut the High Court said these prior disputes cast serious doubt on the complainants motives.\n\nThese circumstances cast a shadow over her motives and raise legitimate concerns about possible fabrication of the rape allegations, Muremba said.The court described the complainants version as both contradictory and implausible, noting that she claimed Smoko assaulted her in broad daylight, reported him to the police, and yet chose to sleep alone with only a three-year-old child that same night despite fearing his return.The absence of any meaningful explanation for these decisions raises serious doubts about the reliability of her version of events, the judge said.Muremba further criticised the magistrate for relying on unverified assumptions.At no point during the trial did the accused admit to visiting the complainants homestead on the date in question It was therefore incorrect for the learned regional magistrate to conclude that it was common cause that the accused had gone to the complainants homestead.The judge also faulted the State for failing to produce key evidence, including the torn clothing the complainant claimed had been ripped during the alleged assault.The absence of such physical evidence, particularly when its existence is explicitly claimed, significantly undermines the credibility of the complainants testimony, she ruled.On the medical findings, Justice Muremba noted that the report only showed healed hymenal tears inconsistent with a recent sexual assault and that the bruises could not conclusively be linked to the alleged rape.The High Court found that the magistrate had wrongly dismissed the defence evidence, including that of Smokos wife, who testified that her husband was at home on the night of the alleged attack.The courts conclusion that the accuseds wife had placed him at the complainants homestead is speculative and unsupported by the evidence.The court then ruled that the inconsistencies, contradictions, and lack of corroboration rendered the conviction unsafe.A conviction must rest on evidence that is persuasive and free from reasonable doubt.That is not the case here.The liberty of the accused is at stake.

Stay with them in their successes, hold their hands and render them support, in their time of need. The collective good of our people and the nation as a whole, is top priority.Vaudzei kuti Zanu PF yakasimba. Zanu PF inzou irikufamba- Zanu PF is alive, vibrant and strong; Zanu PF is the only organised, tried and tested custodian of our revolution and remains focused on bettering the peoples quality of life. Hatidzokeri shure. Ticharamba tichizadzisa zvatinovimbisa, President Mnangagwa said.His remarks concurred with his deputy Constantino Chiwenga who has been preaching about equitable distribution of resources amongst Zimbabweans and not to benefit a few individuals.To all party structures, the President said these should ensure there are clearly laid out strategies and benchmarks towards realising the economic priorities set out until the next gathering, and beyond.As we transition to the National Development Strategy (II) through the whole of party, government and society approach, I expect stakeholders, including ministries, departments and agencies to improve collaboration and synergies.Be assured that the party will continue to exercise overall leadership to all sectors of the economy, added the President commending conference delegates for the in-depth, pragmatic and comprehensive manner of their deliberations, as well as the iron clad discipline, respect and focus towards party business.He also described ZANU PF as indeed, a democratic, mature and organised party which had stayed true to the enduring ideals of the colossal mass party, bequeathed to the people by its Founding Fathers and forebearers.Zanu PF has demonstrated that we are a mammoth, revolutionary mass movement which is transformative, modernising and ensuring that, as the people of this great country, we continue to be masters of our own destiny.I applaud the 22nd National Peoples Conference for engaging in discussions that were robust, candid and factual as well as forward looking and inclusive, said President MnangagwaHe applauded the resolutions of the meeting, further demonstrating that Zanu PF was a well-oiled machine ready to leap forward industrialisation and modernisation as it meets the growing needs of its peoples, for a better quality of life.We boldly discussed the ideas of the future for our party. Together Delegates, guaranteed that the resolutions of the historic Conference remain representative of the aspirations of grassroots communities and the necessary course of action.Further, the emphasis was put on the need to enforce the supremacy of the constitution, which he described as timely.Accordingly, each individual party member must subject themselves to the Constitution; the minority to the majority, lower structures to higher structures, and all members must ultimately, defer to the Central Committee, National Peoples Conference and finally the National Peoples Congress.The rank and file of the party must reinforce this order across every level, across all Leagues of the party, he stated.He warned some members and those outside the party to stop dictating to the party.We are running our own race and no-one, including outsiders, should dictate anything to us. Gwendo gwedu tisu tinoziva mafambirwo arwo. Ngati shandei ndima dzedu dzatakapiwa nemusangano wedu.
