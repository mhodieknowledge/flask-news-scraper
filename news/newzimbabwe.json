            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nPrimary and Secondary Education Minister Torerayi Moyo says his ministry has given unregistered schools until December 31, 2025, to regularise their operations or risk closure.\n\nResponding to questions in Parliament during a Wednesday Question and Answer session, Moyo said government had extended a four-month grace period for illegal private schools and colleges to comply.\n\nHe explained that authorities were cautious not to disadvantage learners who had already registered for examinations, hence the extension to the end of the year or early 2026.\n\nZanu PF legislator for Mt Pleasant, George Mashavave, had asked whether government had a policy framework to monitor and regularise the mushrooming of unregistered schools and colleges across the country.\n\nMoyo confirmed the existence of such a framework and stressed the need to act carefully.\n\nWe have given illegal schools a grace period of four months because we did not want to close them haphazardly, as this would disadvantage learners and violate their fundamental right to education.\n\nI want to assure this august House that very soon in November, or perhaps early next year, we may extend to January 2026. Come January, however, those schools still operating illegally and failing to regularise will be closed, said Moyo.\n\nThe minister admitted that unregistered schools were mushrooming countrywide but insisted that the ministrys Schools Psychological Services and Special Needs Education (SPPRS) department was responsible for school registration and providing technical advice to prospective investors.\n\nHe said circulars had already been sent out warning directors of illegal schools.\n\nI have made a clarion call to those directors of illegal schools to regularise their operations or face penalties at our disposal. All schools that are not registered are operating illegally. While we have avoided immediate closures to protect learners, the grace period expires on December 31, after which circulars will be enforced, and closures implemented, he added.\n\nMoyo also highlighted the governments progress in addressing the countrys school infrastructure deficit.\n\nAccording to a 2022 survey, Zimbabwe required 3,000 additional schools. Since then, more than 600 have been constructed.\n\nFrom 2022 to date, we have built over 600 schools. This year alone, we are targeting at least 200 more, he said.\n\nHowever, Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) MP Ellen Shiriyedenga argued that the school deficit could be fuelling the growth of illegal institutions.\n\nWe were told there is a deficit of 3,000 schools. This gap may be the reason for mushrooming schools, as children should not have to walk long distances. How far has the ministry gone in addressing this deficit? she asked.\n\nOther MPs raised concerns about exploitation, quality of education, and adherence to government policy in unregistered institutions.\n\nZanu PF legislator Clemence Chiduwa questioned whether private schools were being monitored to ensure local languages were taught at primary level.\n\nIn response, Moyo said this was precisely why government insisted on registration.\n\nOur policy is clear, schools must regularise so that we can monitor compliance, including adherence to curriculum and language policy. As it stands, we do not know what is happening in many backyards where illegal schools exist. That is why registration is critical, he said.\n\n",

For example, a supermarket must obtain separate bakery, butchery, restaurant, and liquor licences to operate fully.\n\nNcube, who last year told the Womens Prosperity Conference that his wife had presented him with a long list of licences required before opening her restaurant, admitted the system was excessive.\n\nOn the issue of licences, I totally agree with what women in business are saying. Just recently, my wife showed me a very long list of licences she had to pay before opening a restaurant in Bulawayo. Its just too much for a single business, Ncube said at the time, promising urgent reforms.\n\nNcube on Wednesday unveiled a raft of measures aimed at reducing the cost of doing business and improving Zimbabwes competitiveness.\n\nThe first tranche, which is targeting the agricultural value chain, has seen the requirement for a Small Scale Farmers registration fees of US$500 being scrapped, while the Dairy Processor Registration of US$350 per annum being reduced to a once-off US$50.\n\nFeed manufacturing registration fees were reduced from US$250 to US$20 while livestock movement clearance which attracted US$10 per herd, will now require US$5 per herd.\n\nThe livestock genetics import permit, which was pegged at US$100 will now attract just US$20 while the meat export registration, which was pegged at US$500 will now attract US$100.\n\nOther measures include scrapping food handler certificate fees and capping Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) costs at 0.05% of project value, with a maximum of US$100,000.\n\nThe Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA) livestock levy, biosafety permit, and the CBCA certificate are also among the charges that have been scrapped.\n\nThese reforms are part of governments commitment to ease the cost of doing business and create a more competitive economic environment, Ncube said.\n\nNew Licensing Fees\n\n",

Madondo, in defense of his conduct throughout the rescue process, stated, I made every effort to comply with the legal requirements stipulated by both the Corporate Rescue Plan and the court.\n\nMuller and Haywoods claims painted a grim picture of mismanagement and deceit, but ultimately, the legal discourse suggested that the applicants may have acted prematurely by seeking immediate removal of the CRP without fully exploring all avenues of resolution through the Master of the High Court.\n\nDembure said, The Master must be allowed to deal with the above-stated matters first, as he supervises the first respondent.\n\nThe court ordered that the application be dismissed with costs, emphasising the need for future vigilance and cooperation among all parties involved in corporate rescues.\n\nThe judge said the issues before the Master are not issues the court should be called upon to determine in this application.\n\n",

            "content": "The Guardian\n\nAuthorities in the US were still searching for a suspect in the shooting of conservative activist Charlie Kirk, hours after the close ally ofDonald Trumpwas killed at a Utah university, sparking condemnation from both sides of politics and grave threats from the president.\n\nThis shooting is still an active investigation, theUtahdepartment of public safety said in a statement, adding it was working with the FBI and local police departments.\n\nTwo suspects were taken into custody, but subsequently released. The Governor of Utah, Spencer Cox, called it a political assassination, despite the motive and identity of the shooter remaining unclear.\n\nBeau Mason, the commissioner of Utahs department of public safety, said investigators were reviewing security camera images of the suspect, who wore dark clothing and possibly fired a longer distance shot from a roof.\n\nIn a video message from the Oval Office, Trump vowed that his administration would track down the suspect.\n\nMy administration will find each and every one of those who contributed to this atrocity and to other political violence, including the organisations that fund it and support it, Trump said.\n\nKirkwas shot while addressing a crowdof an estimated 3,000 people at Utah Valley University in Orem, near Salt Lake City. Video footage posted online showed Kirk being questioned by an audience member about gun violencein the moments before he was shot.\n\nVideo footage shows students scrambling to run from the sound of gunfire. Kirk was transported to a nearby hospital, where he later died, authorities said.\n\nLocal officials said the shooting was believed to be a targeted attack by a shooter from the roof of a building.\n\nHis death prompted outrage from Democrats and Republicans, while the president ordered flags to be lowered to half mast to honour him.\n\nThis is a dark day for our state. Its a tragic day for our nation, Cox, a Republican, said at a press conference, appealing for an end to the political violence.\n\nKirkwas the co-founder of Turning Point USA, the largest conservative youth organisation in the country which, played a key role in driving young voter support for Trump in November.\n\nHis appearances on podcasts and across social media brought him fame and notoriety, as he helped to amplify the presidents agenda. Kirk frequently attacked the mainstream media and engaged with culture-war issues around race, gender and immigration, often in a provocative style.\n\nThe event in Utah on Wednesday was the first in his American Comeback Tour at universities around the country. He often used such events, which typically drew large crowds of students, to invite attendees to debate him live.\n\nExperts have warned his death marks a watershed moment, with fears it could inflame an already fractured country and inspire more unrest.\n\nTrump, who routinely describes political rivals and others who stand in his way as radical left lunatics who pose an existential threat to the nation, decried violent political rhetoric in his statement on Wednesday night.\n\nViolence and murder are the tragic consequences of demonising those you disagree with  For years, those on the radical left have compared wonderful Americans like Charlie to Nazis and the worlds worst mass murderers and criminals, he said.\n\nPromising to crackdown on political violence, the president cited recent incidents including the attempts on his life last year, the killing of United Healthcare CEO Brian Thompson and the 2017 shooting of Republican congressman Steve Scalise.\n\nThe presidents list notably did not include violence against Democrats, such asthe murder of Melissa Hortman, a Minnesota state lawmaker, and her husband, or the attack on former House speakerNancy Pelosis husband.\n\nFormer president Barack Obama condemned political violence as despicable, while sending his prayers to Kirks wife and two young children. Joe Biden said there was no no place in our country for this kind of violence.\n\nHakeem Jeffries, the Democratic House minority leader, expressed a similar sentiment: Political violence of any kind and against any individual is unacceptable and completely incompatible with American values.\n\nOn Capitol Hill, an attempt to observe a moment of silence for Kirk on the floor of the House of Representatives degenerated into shouting and finger-pointing. Republican representative Anna Paulina Luna, who worked as Kirks director of Hispanic engagement at Turning Point USA yelled at Democrats, telling them You caused this!\n\nThat prompted Democratic representative Jahana Hayes, a leader on the gun violence prevention taskforce, to shout: Pass some gun laws!\n\nThe US is undergoing its most sustained period of political violence since the 1970s, according to data compiled by the Reuters news agency, which has documented more than 300 cases of politically motivated violent acts since supporters of Trump attacked the US Capitol on 6 January 6 2021.\n\nIn the first six months of the year, the US experienced about 150 politically motivated attacks, nearly twice as many as over the same period last year, Mike Jensen, a researcher at the University of Maryland, told Reuters.\n\nI think we are in a very, very dangerous spot right now that could quite easily escalate into more widespread civil unrest if we dont get a hold of it, Jensen said. This could absolutely serve as a kind of flashpoint that inspires more of it.\n\nWith Reuters\n\n",

The drugs had an estimated street value of US$96.20.\n\nChambati admitted the charge and was convicted, but the magistrate gave her a suspended jail term and 420 hours of community service, citing her guilty plea, remorse and her status as a mother.\n\nJustice Muremba said the magistrate misapplied the Criminal Procedure (Sentencing Guidelines) Regulations, 2023, which set a presumptive penalty of three years imprisonment for cases involving large quantities of drugs or possession in public spaces.\n\nThe sentence imposed was not only inconsistent with the regulatory framework but also failed to reflect the structured approach intended to promote fairness, proportionality, and consistency in sentencing, Justice Muremba ruled.\n\nMuremba criticised the magistrates view that 962.6g was a small amount, saying precedent showed even 700g warranted prison time. Citing past cases, the judge said: Quantities well below this threshold constitute substantial amounts.\n\nThe judge stressed that being caught at a busy shopping mall aggravated the offence: Possession of dangerous drugs in a public setting attracts the presumptive penalty of three years imprisonment.\n\nWhile confirming Chambatis conviction, Justice Muremba refused to certify the sentence, leaving the door open for a harsher penalty.\n\nLenient sentences such as community service for possession of nearly a kilogram of dagga fall short of the justice systems duty to protect society, she warned.\n\n",

            "content": "Metro UKs foreign correspondent Gergana Krasteva reports from Zimbabwe\n\nBeads of sweat drip down Gilbert Nuovus forehead as the memories of working inone of Zimbabwes gold minesrush back in.\n\nOver a year ago, the dad-of-two deserted his job after a colleague was killed when the walls of the pit caved in, burying him alive.\n\nA friend of mine died on the spot. I was afraid for my life, so I went back home, he tellsMetro.\n\nThe road into Matabeleland North, 150 miles from the city of Bulawayo, is uneven and thick with dust, but I am assured that it will eventually lead to a gold mine.\n\nIt is one of the many precious materials for which the land here has been exploited since before British colonial rule, with the first extractions made as early as the 14th century.\n\nAs our SUV crawls forward, a line of workers stretches along the footpath  boys barely into their teens and weathered men three times their age.\n\nMost are wearing the same faded blue overalls, and chipped shovels slung over their shoulders  a sign theyworkin one of the legal mines.\n\nMatabeleland North sits on some of the richest deposits of gold in Africa, and so is plagued with artisanal pits, which are not officially registered with thegovernment, making them illegal.\n\nYet, tens of thousands of men and women are forced into the trade due to unemployment, making up the majority of the mining workforce.\n\nGordon Sibanda used to be one of them.\n\nMetrospeaks with him at the Libeni PrimarySchool, where he volunteers as a chef to somehow contribute to the local community while searching for work.\n\nSitting on a wooden log and smoothing his cooking apron, he admits that poverty is what drove him to mining in 2001, when he was 39.\n\nHe says: A friend introduced me to the trade. Many of my friends are still in the pits to this day.\n\nMining is strenuous labor. You can spend months searching for a mineral you cannot see and do not know if it is actually in the earth.\n\nAnd when luck would fall on our side, you may get something.\n\nIn Zimbabwes mines, death never seems far.\n\nSo when I ask Gordon if any of his colleagues were injured or killed in the pits, he replies, almost nonchalantly, as he takes off his woolen beanie: Ah yes. Three have been killed when the mines collapsed.\n\nDisintegrated shafts, explosions, flooding  each shift carries the chance that a worker will not return home.\n\nAs many as 237 people died in incidents in 2023, making it one of the very worst years in the countrys mining history.\n\nAnd up until May this year, 59 fatal incidents were reported  most in illegal mines, like the one that Gordon worked in.\n\nTo fully comprehend the vast scale of illegal mining,Metrosits down with Pumulu Masu, government school inspector, who says that most people in Matabeleland North dig without a permit, which means the state does not profit from it.\n\nMostly, people in the area mine illegally, she explains. Lets say there is an agricultural field. Instead of a farm, they will turn it into a mine.\n\nEven in their personal properties  behind their homes  people start to dig.\n\nWe can always tell by the maps of soil. If people suspect there is gold, they will always dig no matter what the land is.\n\nWhile Gordon worked in an illegal pit, Gilbert has experience in a registered mine.\n\nTheir only piece of advice  what they want everyone to know  is do not do it, do not work in a mine, pointing to how deadly the trade is.\n\nGilbert says: The pit is not that strong as miners often dig tunnels [without much planning], making the walls weak.\n\nWe are not given helmets or boots to protect us. It is difficult to survive.\n\nThe work is just too much. In mines, there are no set working hours.You work and you stop when it is time to eat, then you go back to work. It is continuous, we do not stop.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, mining runs through generations like a vein of gold itself. It is often seen as a rite of passage for children as young as nine, and at the same time a lifeline for families in the depths of poverty.\n\nThough the pay is still meagre. All the money Gordon earned was spent on food for his large family, all 13 of them.\n\nAt the time, he was the sole breadwinner for his wife, three sons and three daughters, his own parents and siblings.\n\nHand to mouth, nothing else [is left], he adds, gesturing at his grandson, a four-year-old boy playing with his friends a few metres away.\n\nYet, despite facing unemployment, Gordon has not given mining another thought because of the precarious conditions.\n\nLike him, Gilbert also did not live a life of luxury  but he was under no such illusions when he picked up a shovel.\n\nAfter three months of digging, he was paid around $20, and only after gold was actually discovered. Miners divvy up half the proceeds, while the rest goes straight to the owners pocket.\n\nThere are other dangers too.\n\nThe industry has long been linked to human rights abuses, environmental violations and labour exploitation, particularly in lithium mines operated byChina, despite denials by Zimbabwes government. About 70% of all lithium is processed there.\n\nRobert Mugabes successor, president Emmerson Mnangagwa, of ZANU-PF, has so far supported the takeovers, arguing they will bring economic growth.\n\nPerhaps this has materialised in the capital, Harare; yet, on the ground, in Matabeleland North, the mines have brought little benefits  if any  to the local community.\n\nMetrogained access to Turk, one of the oldest gold mines in Zimbabwe, located in the Bubbi District.\n\nArmed security usually guard gold mines, but today luck has fallen on our side  at least for a few minutes.\n\nPiles of reddish earth and stones mount inside the compound. A dragline excavator in the distance seems to have dosed off, but only momentarily.\n\nThe mine itself gapes before us, an abyss carved so deep and wide that, when peering over the edge, the bottom is not visible.\n\nAcross the road from the pit, a supermarket and two bars stand shoulder to shoulder, their doors flung wide open. A few men have gathered around a plastic table, kicking dust with their feet as they chat.\n\nThis is the heart of what is accepted as the traditional mining community in Zimbabwe.\n\nThere are no clinics or schools, or in fact any other reliable infrastructure apart from the mine.\n\nBars are always the first to spring up whenever gold is unearthed, offering miners a place to unwind and spend their hard-earned cash in.\n\nAs I come to learn, this has also led to alcohol abuse among workers who use drinking as a coping mechanism.\n\nA source, who wished to remain anonymous, tellsMetro: You cannot put a figure on how many people have died because of it. Some have been found dead on pavements.\n\nWorkers deaths are often blamed on the rise in popularity of an illicit brew called krango, which can cause severe organ damage, and is associated with soaring rates of binge drinking.\n\nMy source explains that it is mostly made from ethanol concentrate diluted with large amounts of water, adding: Krango is what it is all about in rural areas. It is packed in bottles of 250ml.\n\nSanctions on Zimbabwe were first introduced in the early 2000s, mainly by the UK, the EU, and the US, amid allegations of human rights abuses, electoral fraud, and Robert Mugabes land reform programme.\n\nThese measures are not broad trade embargoes. They focus on asset freezes and travel bans on senior government officials linked to the state.\n\nThe US also brought out the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act (ZDERA) in 2001, which restricted its access to international financial institutions.\n\nWhile the sanctions target political elites, the Zimbabwean government argues they have deterred foreign investment and limited lines of credit  so much so that the now vice president Constantino Chiwenga said the country had lost more than $150 billion.\n\nSome are even packed by legitimate companies. It is sold for just $0.50, and the strength is usually around 40% strength.\n\nDespite the reported issues plaguing Zimbabwes mines, the government is hellbent on expanding the industry  the faster, the better.\n\nFor a nation that fought so hard to rid itself from colonial rule, it now relies on investors from China, South Africa, Australia, Canada and the UK, and it is eager to attract more.\n\nThe sector as a whole accounts for more than 60% of export revenues and 13% of gross domestic product (GDP), according to national statistics from 2023.\n\nTo increase those numbers, the Zimbabwean government introduced the Vision 2030 plan to become an upper-middle-income economy by the end of the decade.\n\nSupposedly, one of the key objectives is to grow the mining sector to have a revenue of $12 billion per year.\n\nIt makes money, that is for sure, though not for the small miner like Gordon or Gilbert.\n\nThey are currently unemployed and living with the memories of the hell inside the mines.\n\n",
