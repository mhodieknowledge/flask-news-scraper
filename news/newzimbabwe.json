            "content": "By Irish Times\n\nCARE workers from Zimbabwe, who allege they paid thousands of euro each to a recruiter to secure work permits, have told a tribunal of living in freezing shared accommodation without their wages after the jobs they were promised in the Republic failed to materialise.\n\nTestifying to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) this week, one of the workers said she was threatened with having her work permit cancelled when she asked about going to another job she was offered.Another said she was left without income for months and had to eventually leave a staff house when the landlord arrived, threatening to change the locks.Shingirirai Chiwaridzo, Nombeko Hlabangana, Brenda Mubaiwa, Tatenda Ncube, Allen Phillip Ndhlovu, Nicola Sibanda, Nobuhle Sibanda and Agapao Munashe Zvihari are each pursuing complaints under the Payment of Wages Act 1991 against their former employer, Unity Healthcare Services Ltd.The Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland (MRCI), which is representing the six women and two men, says they are owed months of unpaid wages each, plus repayment of sums allegedly charged to procure their work permits. The company is disputing the complaints.Giving evidence to the WRC, the workers said they were approached in Zimbabwe and paid fees of between 2,000 and 3,600 to Unity Healthcare or one of its directors in 2022 or 2023.Giving evidence, worker Nobuhle Sibanda said Unity Healthcare chief executive Londiwe Maphosa quoted her 1,000 to secure a work permit and informed her she would have to pay 3,000 in total when accommodation costs were factored in.I couldnt raise the whole amount. I raised 2,600, Ms Sibanda said in evidence. An offer letter, contract and non-disclosure agreement were sent to her after she wired the money to Ms Maphosas co-director in the firm, Bruce Magama.Most of the group flew to Ireland at their own expense in December 2023 or January 2024 after being told they were going to be starting work within weeks at a care facility that was set to open in Virginia, Co Cavan, they said.The pay on offer was in the region of 560 a week on a base hourly rate of 15 an hour, the tribunal heard.Several of the workers moved into a staff house Unity had rented near the centre and training was held for some, but the jobs failed to materialise, the tribunal heard.The company director, Mr Magama, told the hearing the centres opening had been delayed, and referred to attempts to arrange employment elsewhere for workers.He said one healthcare firm had been willing to take staff, but Ms Sibanda said her understanding was that the other company had made it clear that it was not taking anyone from Unity Healthcare.The tribunal was told that at one point, seven workers were living communally in the staff house, some two to a bedroom, others bedding down in its diningroom.Another worker, Agapau Munashe Zvihari, said her mother had arranged temporary lodgings for her in Galway, but after the delays, her landlady said: We have to go to Cavan and see if you have this job.Her landlady had formed the view that the company was being run by scammers, she said. When she spoke to Ms Maphosa, she was told: You signed an NDA [non-disclosure agreement]. Why are you talking to these people youre staying with about our company?Ms Chiwaridzo said the workers at the staff house were scared to talk.Ms Maphosa  who was married to Mr Magama, the witness said  came to the house on one occasion and shouted at us for answering questions from another worker about the opening of the centre.Some of the workers were able to earn small amounts of money cleaning houses or doing childminding, the tribunal heard.Several workers gave evidence that the company undertook to pay them 100 a week while they were waiting for work, but that this arrangement stopped after three weeks, and some further small ad hoc sums were given to some who complained about financial circumstances.However, others said they received no money at all from the company which had brought them to the Republic for work.Ms Chiwaridzo said the workers living at the staff house pooled their resources to try to pay for electricity, food and heating. It was just not enough, she said.Under questioning by Mr Magama, she said the businessman had been sending money for food from January to March 2024 and making some contributions to the heating bill, but not consistently.Ms Chiwaridzo said she needed a letter of no objection from Unity Healthcare, as the sponsor of her work permit, to release her and allow her to take up another employment contract.It took from first asking in March 2024 to October that year to get the letter  by which time two job offers had fallen through, she said.Brenda Mubaiwa said she had left kids at home to come to to the Republic and work, but had only ever been paid 300 by Unity Healthcare. Ms Mubaiwa said that to pay for her son to sit exams, her mother had resorted to borrowing money.The workers were giving evidence to the WRC on Thursday. The matter has been adjourned by adjudication officer Breiffni ONeill, who will hear the evidence of a ninth complainant at a later date.Pretty Ndawo and Sylwia Nowakowska of the MRCI appeared for the workers. Mr Magama appeared on his own as respondent.\n\nTestifying to the Workplace Relations Commission (WRC) this week, one of the workers said she was threatened with having her work permit cancelled when she asked about going to another job she was offered.\n\nAnother said she was left without income for months and had to eventually leave a staff house when the landlord arrived, threatening to change the locks.Shingirirai Chiwaridzo, Nombeko Hlabangana, Brenda Mubaiwa, Tatenda Ncube, Allen Phillip Ndhlovu, Nicola Sibanda, Nobuhle Sibanda and Agapao Munashe Zvihari are each pursuing complaints under the Payment of Wages Act 1991 against their former employer, Unity Healthcare Services Ltd.The Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland (MRCI), which is representing the six women and two men, says they are owed months of unpaid wages each, plus repayment of sums allegedly charged to procure their work permits.

Among those whom he allegedly attacked are goalkeeper Washington Arubi, Emmanuel Jalai, and Chirewa.Inside sources within the camp have revealed that senior players have since launched a formal complaint to the Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) regarding the coachs conduct.In addressing Chirewas issue, ZIFA has since released a statement clarifying Chirewas withdrawal from the squad ahead of Mondays match against Qatar.ZIFA wishes to inform the nation, the media fraternity, and all that midfielder Tawanda Chirewa has been granted permission to leave the national team camp, as had been agreed prior to the player joining the camp.This decision was reached with the full blessing and consent of ZIFA, after Wolverhampton Wanderers formally requested an opportunity for the player to be assessed by their new technical team as part of their internal preparations for the season ahead.ZIFA emphasises that this development is not a withdrawal, nor does it reflect any dispute or disagreement.

What is going on? Can I have an explanation from the Whips? Mudenda asked.\n\nZanu PF Chief Whip Pupurai Togarepi informed the Speaker that three committees were away.\n\nAs per your directive in this House, there should not be more than two Committees at a moment a week, but sometimes they just go without even advising the Whips. I am supposed to concur with those who arrange these outreaches. When I came in, I realised there were a few members only to be told that these committees would have gone out without my knowledge. We need to sit down with the administration to ensure that we protect attendance.\n\nResponding, Mudenda emphasised that parliamentary attendance must take precedence.\n\nWhile the public hearings are critical, and I do not know why they should arise after we have had public hearings on the Pre-Budget. There is no excuse why these committees should be out. Absolutely no excuse. The priority is for members to be here in the House as representatives of the people. You are the voice of the people who are not able to be in this august House.\n\nNow, if you are not there, how is their voice going to be heard? So, this must stop forthwith from next week. No committees should go out unless absolutely necessary.\n\nIn recent weeks, MPs have been making what observers describe as outrageous demands, claiming that their allowances are insufficient to meet their personal needs. Lawmakers earn extra money when travelling through additional allowances.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nCBZ Holdings, Zimbabwes largest financial services group by assets and deposits, has posted a 10% increase in profit after tax for the nine months ending 30 September 2025, reaching ZWG1.11 billion, up from ZWG1.01 billion in the same period last year.\n\nPresenting a trading update for the nine months ended 30 September 2025, CBZ Group Chief Legal Advisor and Governance, Rumbidzayi Jakanani, said the growth recorded comes as the countrys macroeconomic environment stabilises, with the ZWG holding steady against the US dollar and inflation easing into single digits.\n\nCBZ Group Chief Legal Advisor and Governance, Rumbidzayi Jakanani\n\nThe Group recorded a profit after tax of ZWG 1.11 billion, representing a 10% increase from ZWG1.01 billion recorded in the same period of the previous year. Total income amounted to ZWG4.23 billion, 58% above the ZWG 2.68 billion reported in the prior year, reflecting stable performance, she said.\n\nWhile the increase in profits may seem modest, it reflects CBZHs strong cost control and strategic diversification, as the bank navigates a period of monetary tightening and stable gold-backed reserves. This stability has allowed CBZH to focus on organic growth rather than hedge against extreme inflation volatility.\n\nTotal income surged 58% to ZWG 4.23 billion, up from ZWG 2.68 billion in 2024, with non-funded income contributing a significant 65% (ZWG 2.75 billion), reflecting a 54% increase year-on-year. This jump in non-interest income underscores CBZHs advantage in transactional banking, supported by its leading deposit base and robust digital channels, which have thrived amid growing electronic payment adoption and a stable exchange rate.\n\nFunded income also grew 66%, reaching ZWG 1.46 billion, as the bank selectively lent into higher-yielding sectors while maintaining strong asset quality, unlike some competitors who have struggled in volatile periods.\n\nThe balance sheet expanded 13% to ZWG 38.93 billion, with deposits rising by 25% to ZWG 27.09 billion. This strong growth in customer deposits has enabled CBZH to maintain a healthy loan-to-deposit ratio while maintaining high liquidity levels. The banks focus on stable, low-cost retail and corporate deposits has helped shield it from risks associated with short-term interbank funding.\n\nCapital adequacy remains strong, with all divisions meeting regulatory requirements. The bank is also planning fresh capital injections for its growth subsidiaries, positioning it for future opportunities in a fragmented market.\n\nLooking ahead, the global economy is expected to record moderate growth on the back of easing inflation, improving financial conditions, and technological productivity gains. The local economy is set to continue on the positive growth trajectory, supported by expected better rainfall season, higher prices for gold, improved energy supply, coupled with the ongoing fiscal reforms that will enhance the ease of doing business, added Jakanani.\n\n",
