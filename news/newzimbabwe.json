            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZANU PF Legal Secretary Patrick Chinamasa has said controversial businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei is now a member of the partys Central Committee and the matter is over and irreversible.\n\nTagwireis co-option into the Central Committee has dragged on, with a faction within the ruling party reportedly opposed to his endorsement into the influential organ.\n\nIn a statement posted on socialmedia, Chinamasa said, The Zanupf Department of Legal Affairs is relieved and takes note that the furore/controversy/confusion/wrangle/much ado about nothing/social media hype/misinformation/disinformation that surrounded Harare Provincial Coordinating Committee (PCC) co-option of Cde Kudakwashe Tagwirei into the Zanu PF Central Committee is now over and irreversibly settled.\n\nFrom the outset, it was difficult to understand the source of the problem. Our Harare PCC convened on Monday, 31 March 2025, and voted to recommend the cooption of Cde Tagwirei into the Central Committee.\n\nThe Province addressed the letter of recommendation to the Zanupf Secretary General, Cde Dr. Obert Moses Mpofu. The letter was copied to the Departments of the Commissariat and Legal Affairs, amongst others.\n\nThe confirmation by Chinamsa is in contradiction with the ZANU PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwasremarks earlier this month that Tagwireis bribe would not work in the party.\n\nTagwireis admission into this elite structure is being widely interpreted as part of a long-term strategy to position him for a future presidential bid, setting him on a collision course with other factions, particularly those aligned with Vice President Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nThe ZANU PF benefactor has been viewed as exploiting his proximity to President Emmerson Mnangagwa to push his leadership agenda.\n\nChinamasa acknowledged that the co-option of Tagwirei has been divisive in the ruling party.\n\nSo the controversy surrounding Cde Tagwireis co-option into the Central Committee surprises me and took me completely off guard. Given Cde Tagwireis commitment to Zanupf and his track record in the service of the Party, the somewhat negative publicity and narrative surrounding his co-option into the Central Committee is undeserved.\n\nI have been a member of the Zanupf Central Committee continuously and without break since December 1987, and a member of the Zanupf Politburo since the year 2000 to date, and I can state unequivocally that throughout this long period of nearly 38 years as Central Committee or as Politburo, we have never had to debate, let alone discuss, PCC recommendations of cooptions into the Central Committee. We always treated such recommendations as fait accompli.\n\nThe cooption of Cde Tagwirei is the first ever to be the subject of discussion and social media commentaries. The only explanation why the Tagwirei cooption has attracted such controversy may be because there are people out there who, for reasons best known to themselves, have an axe to grind, said Chinamasa.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nA BBC Africa Eye investigation has revealed how women, known as madams, have involved children as young as 13 in prostitution in Kenya.\n\nIn the transit town of Maai Mahiu, in Kenyas Rift Valley, trucks and lorries pound the streets day and night transporting goods and people across the country into Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThe key transport hub, just 50km (31 miles) east of the capital, Nairobi, is known for prostitution, but it is also a breeding ground for child sexual abuse.\n\nTwo undercover investigators, posing as sex workers wanting to learn how to become madams, spent months earlier this year infiltrating the sex trade in the town.\n\nTheir secret filming reveals two different women who say they know it is illegal and then introduce the investigators to underage girls in the sex industry.\n\nThe BBC gave all its evidence to the Kenyan police in March. The BBC believes the madams have moved location since then. The police said the women and young girls we filmed could not be traced. To date there have been no arrests.\n\nConvictions are rare in Kenya. For successful prosecutions, police need testimonies from children. Often vulnerable minors are too afraid to testify.\n\nThe BBCs grainy footage filmed on the street in the dark showed one woman, who calls herself Nyambura, laughing as she says: Theyre still children, so its easy to manipulate them by just handing them sweets.\n\nProstitution is a cash crop in Maai Mahiu; the truckers basically fuel it. And thats how we benefit. Its been normalised in Maai Mahiu, she explained, adding that she had one girl as young as 13, who had already been working for six months.\n\nIt becomes very risky when youre dealing with minors. You cant just bring them outopenly in town. I only sneak them out at night in great secrecy, Nyambura said.\n\nThe act of prostitution by a consenting adult is not explicitly criminalised under Kenyan national law but it is banned by many municipal by-laws. It is not banned in Maai Mahiu, which is part of Nakuru county.\n\nUnder the penal code it is illegal to live from the earnings of prostitution, either as a sex worker or third party facilitating or profiting from prostitution.\n\nThe trafficking or sale of minors under the age of 18 carries a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life.\n\nWhen asked whether the clients wear condoms, Nyambura said she usually made sure they had protection but the odd one did not.\n\nSome children want to earn more [so dont use them]. Some are forced [not to use them], she said.\n\nIn another meeting, she led the undercover investigator to a house where three young girls sat huddled on a sofa, another on a hard-backed chair.\n\nNyambura then left the room, giving the investigator an opportunity to speak to the girls alone.\n\nThey described being repeatedly abused for sex, on a daily basis.\n\nSometimes you have sex with multiple people. The clients force you to do unimaginable things, said one of the girls.\n\nThere are no recent statistics on the number of children forced to work in Kenyas sex industry. In 2012,the US State Department Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Kenyacited an estimate of 30,000, a figure derived from the Kenyan government and now defunct non-governmental organisation (NGO), Eradicate Child Prostitution in Kenya.\n\nOther studies have focused on specific areas, especially along the countrys coast  known for its tourist resorts.A 2022 reportfor the NGO Global Fund to End Modern Slavery found almost 2,500 children were forced into sex work in Kilifi and Kwale counties.\n\nA second undercover investigator gained the trust of a woman who called herself Cheptoo and had multiple meetings with her.\n\nShe said selling young girls meant she could earn a living and be comfortable.\n\nYou carry out this kind of business in great secrecy because it is illegal, she said.\n\nIf anyone says they want a young girl, I ask them to pay me. We also have our regulars who always come back for them.\n\nCheptoo took the undercover investigator to a club to meet four of her girls. The youngest said she was 13 years old. The others said they were 15.\n\nShe opened up about the profit she makes from them, saying for every 3,000 Kenyan shillings ($23; 17) the girls deliver, her share was 2,500 shillings ($19; 14).\n\nAt another meeting, in a house in Maai Mahiu, Cheptoo left the undercover investigator alone with two underage girls.\n\nOne of them told her she had, on average, sex with five men a day.\n\nWhen asked what happened if she refused to have sex without a condom, she said she had no choice.\n\nI have to [have sex without a condom]. I will be chased away, and I have nowhere to run to. I am an orphan.\n\nKenyas sex industry is a complex, murky world where both men and women are involved in facilitating child prostitution.\n\nIt is not known how many children are forced into sex work in Maai Mahiu, but in this small town of around 50,000 people it is easy to find them.\n\nA former sex worker, known as Baby Girl, now provides refuge in Maai Mahiu for girls who have escaped sexual abuse.\n\nThe 61-year-old worked in the sex industry for 40 years  first finding herself on the streets in her early twenties. She was pregnant and had her three young children with her after fleeing her husband because of domestic violence.\n\nAt her wooden kitchen table in a bright parlour at the front of her house, she introduced the BBC to four young women who were all forced into sex work by madams in Maai Mahiu when they were children.\n\nEach girl shared similar stories of broken families or abuse at home  they came to Maai Mahiu to escape, only to be violently abused again.\n\nMichelle described how, at 12 years old, she lost her parents to HIV and was evicted on to the streets where she met a man who gave her somewhere to live and began sexually abusing her.\n\nI literally had to pay him in kind for educating me. I reached my limit, but I had no-one, she said.\n\nTwo years later, she was approached by a woman who turned out to be a madam in Maai Mahiu and forced her into sex work.\n\nLilian, who is now 19, also lost her parents at a very young age. She was left with an uncle who filmed her in the shower and sold the images to his friends. The voyeurism soon turned into rape.\n\nThat was my worst day. I was 12 then.\n\nWhen she escaped, she was raped again by a truck driver who took her to Maai Mahiu. It was here, like Michelle, where she was approached by a woman who forced her into sex work.\n\nThese young womens short lives have been fuelled by violence, neglect and abuse.\n\nNow, housed by Baby Girl, they are learning new skills  two in a photography studio and two in a beauty salon.\n\nThey also assist Baby Girl with her outreach work in the community.\n\nNakuru county has one of the highest rates of HIV infection in Kenya, and Baby Girl, supported by US aid agency USAID, is on a mission to educate people about the risks of unprotected sex.\n\nShe has an office at Karagita Community Health Centre, near Lake Naivasha, where she works providing condoms and advice.\n\nHowever, with US President Donald Trumps decision to pull USAID funding, her outreach programmes are about to stop.\n\nYou see how vulnerable these children are. How would they survive on their own? They are still healing.\n\nThe US government did not respond to comments in this investigation about the likely impact of its funding cuts. USAID officially closed last month.\n\nFor now, Lilian is focused on learning photography and recovering from abuse.\n\nI am not afraid any more, because Baby Girl is there for me, she said. She is helping us bury the past.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, there was a recent landmark judgment in the Zimbabwe Courts on land acquisition and compensation by the government which may affect some acquired land, what was the case about?\n\nVM: Yes, there was indeed a landmark constitutional judgment delivered on 29thJuly, 2025 in Alistair Michael Fletcher v Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development and others.\n\nWell, I will attempt to summarise the facts. The land in question is in Umguza on the peripheries of Bulawayo City. It was incorporated into the City of Bulawayo through a statutory instrument issued by the President in 1999. Sometime in 2000, the land was subsequently gazetted for acquisition by the State under the land reform program and caveats were placed on the title deeds to perfect the acquisition.\n\nThe main issue for contention was whether or not the land was capable of acquisition under the land reform program which targeted agricultural land, as the land had become urban land by means of the statutory instrument of 1999, I referred to and various correspondence from the Bulawayo City Council which referred to it and adjacent lands as urban territory.\n\nReporter: At face value, it appears simple enough, what where the main areas of contention?\n\nVM: It may appear so, however, there was a conflict in the understanding and application of various constitutional provisions. Main being the interpretation of S16B (2) of the old constitution which limited the rights of individual to challenge the acquisition of land for agricultural purposes after it has been gazetted and conversely, the rights of the courts to adjudicate on such cases where land was acquired under the land reform process. S16B (3) of the same constitution reserved judicial review powers with the courts where expropriation was not in terms of section 16 B(2) as was eventually decided in this case. The other constitutional questions which had to be decided included the right to hold, use and not be deprived of property and the right to equal protection and benefit of the law in situations where the application of s16B(2)a was challenged, which section is now s72 of the new constitution.,\n\nReporter: What was the decision of the court and its reasoning?\n\nVM: The Constitutional Court agreed with the decision of the High Court that the land in question was urban land by virtue of it being classified as such by law and the City of Bulawayo, that being so, the State cannot compulsorily acquire urban land without compensation by using the constitutional provisions reserved for land reform acquisitions.\n\nCompensation in land reform acquisitions is limited to improvements made on land.\n\nIn reaching its decision, the court considered the meaning of agricultural land in terms of the constitution and whether Mr. Fletchers land can be classified as agricultural land. It also considered its own jurisdiction to hear the matter on the basis of whether the land in question was agricultural or urban land.\n\nReporter: What are the key takeaways from this judgment?\n\nVM: Key takeaways are that the land reform constitutional provisions ousting the authority of the courts to hear and determine acquired land refer only to agricultural land.\n\nThe courts still retain the right to hear cases to confirm whether such acquisition was done in terms of the constitutional provisions and for cases referring to compensation of improvements.\n\nThe courts also upheld the constitutional provisions relating to right to property and equal access to the courts for all urban land.\n\nThe other takeaway is not mentioned in the judgment but is necessary as it reasserts the position that our court system still functions; this is a clear case separating the government and judiciary in their interpretation of the law.\n\nReporter: How will this judgment affect owners of tracts of land in periurban areas?\n\nVM: In my view, it brings certainty that once land is classified as urban land, it is not capable of compulsory acquisition under the land reform program or acquisition without compensation. It will assist developers and investors in their planning, knowing there is precedent from the highest court securing property rights\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima, we have to end here because of our time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw.\n\n",

In the affidavit, he identified himself as a Zimbabwean man living in Centurion, possessing a Zimbabwean passport with an unverified number.\n\nAccording to the supporting affidavit, Ezihes spousal application had been pending for two years without a response or decision from Home Affairs.\n\nIn June 2025, he served a notice of motion on home affairs and the director general of home affairs.\n\nEzihe asked the court to direct home affairs officials to issue a decision on the outcome of his application within 30 days.\n\nIn May 2025, Bandas affidavit, which claimed to be from Ezihe, was deposed and commissioned to support the notice of motion.\n\nLater, Ezihes supplementary affidavit, which supports Bandas affidavit, was deposed and commissioned in June 2025. This occurred without the prior leave of the court.\n\nEzihes legal representative argued that there were no legal provisions requiring the parties to obtain leave before supplementing their court submissions.\n\nHowever, Judge Keitumetse Johanna Mogale said the decision to permit the filing of an additional affidavit remains within the courts discretion.\n\nJudge Mogale said if affidavits are filed without leave from the court, the affidavits can be ignored.\n\nI conclude that supplementing court papers without prior leave from the court is not allowed. Disregarding rules governing the filing of affidavits can result in the affidavit being struck from the record or the court refusing to consider it, she said.\n\nFurthermore, the judge was not impressed with the application and said it was drafted as a cut-and-paste from a template.\n\nShe further criticised Ezihes legal representative for failing to comply with procedural standards.\n\nMs. Hadebe bears the duty to uphold professional integrity in her dealings with the client, the court, and in all professional interactions, said judge Mogale.\n\nTherefore, it is my view that the applicant (Ezihe) has failed to make out a proper case for an order compelling the respondents (home affairs officials) to issue the outcome of the applicants spousal permit application, she said.\n\nEzihes application was dismissed.\n\n",
