            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nZANU PF Mbire District Coordinating Committee chairman in Mashonaland Central province, Takesure Chikwamba has been accused of orchestrating the arrest of former Agriculture deputy minister Douglas Karoro on theft charges.\n\nThe move was allegedly driven by revenge after Chikwamba lost the Mbire Constituency to Karoro in the 2018 harmonised elections.\n\nThis came out in court this Thursday when Chikwamba appeared as a State witness against Karoro who is accused of diverting fertilisers that were meant for Mbire district under the Presidential Input Programme.\n\nThe former deputy minister, who is being represented by Admire Rubaya, denies the allegations, describing them as a fabrication by his political rivals, among them Chikwamba, whom he outclassed in the partys primary elections to represent the constituency in parliament.\n\nChikwamba told Regional Magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa that he reported the matter to the police after he received reports from his party subordinates of suspicious movement of fertilisers at GMB Mushumbi.\n\nHe said he was not in Mbire at the time but was at his home in Ruwa when he was informed about the movement of fertilisers at Mushumbi GMB depot heading to Guruve GMB and rushed to the Police Morris Depot to report.\n\nWhen I got information from Nawo Gumbo and Mutukudzi about the fertilisers I got in touch with intelligence officers from the Presidents office. I also made investigations at GMB Guruve, where I was told there was no ammonium nitrate which was said to be going to be exchanged with compound D which had been taken at Mushumbi.\n\nWe expected the compound D would be returned but it was never delivered to the people of Mbire, he said.\n\nThe defence argued that Chikwamba had no locus standi to receive information at GMB and this shows he had a motive to get back at Karoro who had beaten him in elections.\n\nThey argued that in pursuit of his vendetta, Chikwamba rushed to the police despite not having any evidence but just words from his security officers on the ground.\n\nThey added that Chikwamba never called Karoro to inquire about the allegations but rushed to the police as he had the intention to sink him.\n\nYou had ulterior motives; that is why you did not call him to ascertain whether it was true or not. You just concluded he was a thief and rushed to report without even hearing his side of the story, Rubaya argued.\n\nChikwamba responded, saying he went to the police because he had been told a whistleblower whom he could not name was processing documents at GMB to substantiate the allegations against the former legislator.\n\nThe defence insisted the allegations were a fabrication as they were not supported by evidence, adding that the report was not even made where the alleged offence occurred.\n\nThey said Chikwamba ignored his nearest police stations, Ruwa, Mabvuku and Harare Central and instead rushed to CCD, which ordinarily gets reports through referrals.\n\nThis, they said, showed malice and an intention to get back at Karoro because he had a bone to chew with the accused for defeating them in the elections.\n\nYou were determined to be in the new building in Mt Hampden (parliament) that you sought to have him dismissed through baseless allegations. You ignored all the police stations and just rushed to Morris Depot, now Mkushi Depot, Rubaya said.\n\nChikwamba said he was not bitter after losing the election to Karoro but instead he was happy because it was a learning curve and first time to compete, adding that Karoro was just raising it as a defence to the allegations.\n\nHearing continues next Thursday.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI) says easing ZWG rates are indicative of the local currencys economic stabilising effect.\n\nThe ZiG month-on-month inflation slightly decreased to settle at 0.3% in the month of June 2025 from 0.9% recorded in the month of May 2025.\n\nThe prolonged period of inflation at rates below 1% since February 2025 generally reflect a ZiG price stabilising economy. In addition, this may also indicate success of monetary policy in restoring price discipline as compared to past experiences with the Zimbabwean dollar (ZWL), said CZI.\n\nThe industry lobby group said the low levels of inflation will help build trust in the currency, which might also encourage greater usage of ZiG in transactions and could also boost the likelihood of a gradual de-dollarisation process leading to a ZiG mono currency regime by 2030.\n\nThe ZiG year-on-year inflation rate slightly increased to settle at 92.5% in the month of June 2025 (Figure 2), gaining 0.4 percentage points from a rate of 92.1% recorded in May 2025. While the month-on-month inflation is showing that inflation is currently under control, the high annual inflation rate reflects historical price instability legacies whose effects are still at play, said CZI.\n\nThe industry lobby group said the high annual inflation level creates pricing uncertainty, making it difficult for businesses to set prices, forecast costs, or even to negotiate contracts.\n\nTherefore, sustaining month-on-month inflation at the current low rates is crucial for eliminating this high annual inflation, which is expected to only start falling in October 2025. Only then will restoring confidence in the ZiG, protecting real incomes, and supporting sustainable economic recovery become more realistic, added CZI.\n\n",
