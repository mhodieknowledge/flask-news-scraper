Those keen to invest must take forward positions, said Charamba.\n\nCharambas sentiments follow an announcement by Air Zimbabwe that it would be introducing the Mutare flights during the Sanganai/Hlanganani World Travel Expo, which will run from September 10 to 12.\n\nThe flights will provide a seamless travel for tourists to visit attractions in Manicaland Province.\n\nIn a statement, Air Zimbabwe Chief Executive Edmund Makona indicated that the flights might be a common feature after the Expo.\n\nThis operation is a pilot project. We are testing the market, understanding demand, and exploring the long-term viability of this route. If the demand is there, Air Zimbabwe will be ready to make it a permanent feature of our network, said Makona.\n\n",

But both this claim  and that the war was provoked  have been repeatedly rebuffed by Western allies.\n\nIt was in 2014 that Putin seized Crimea and Russian proxies grabbed part of eastern Ukraine. Years later, in February 2022,Putin then ordered Russias full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nPutins latest comments come days after Russia launched itssecond biggest aerial attackon Ukraine in the war.\n\nOn Friday, French President Emmanuel Macron said that Putin faced a Monday deadline set by Trump to agree to peace talks with Zelensky.\n\nIf the Russian leader does not agree, it will show again President Putin has played President Trump, said Macron.\n\nBut in an interview with CNN, on 22 August, Trump himself again gave Putin a couple of weeks to give a response before the US takes action, in the latest of a series of ultimatums and deadlines he has issued to the Russian leader.\n\nTrump had previously said he could solve the Ukraine war in one day.\n\nFollowing his meeting with Putin last month, Trump dropped a demand for a ceasefire and called instead for a permanent peace deal.\n\nHe also met Zelensky along with top European leaders who paid an urgent visit to Washington DC.\n\nTrump insisted there would be no going into Nato by Ukraine as part of a peace deal.\n\nBut he also hinted there would be security guarantees, saying Europe was the first line of defence and that the US would be involved.\n\nWell give them good protection, he said, though he clarified it would not mean sending US troops to Ukraine.\n\nUS Special Envoy Witkoff also told CNN thatPutin had agreed to security guarantees.\n\nHe said this would see the US and Europe effectively offer Article 5-like language to cover a security guarantee, referring to the Nato clause which states that member states should defend another member that has come under attack.\n\nZelensky has said he expected a framework for security guarantees to be set out on paper as soon as this week.\n\nBut last Friday, Russia criticised Western proposals as one-sided and clearly designed to contain Russia, adding that it turned Kyiv into a strategic provocateur.\n\nRussian attacks on Ukraine have continued. Last Thursday, Moscow fired 629 drones and missiles at Kyiv, killing 23 people in one of the biggest aerial assaults of the war so far, prompting outrage from European leaders.\n\nGermany and France have since pledged to put pressure on Russia to agree to a deal.\n\nMeanwhile, Zelensky hasrejected proposals for a buffer zonewith Russia as part of a peace deal.\n\nHe has accused Russia of not being ready for diplomacy and seeking ways to postpone the end of the war.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nThe people of Malawi are set to vote for their next leader, following a turbulent five years involving economic turmoil, natural disasters and the shock death of the nations vice-president.\n\nCurrent President Lazarus Chakwera is vying for a second term, his main rival being Peter Mutharika, an octogenarian who has also held office in the southern African nation once before.\n\nTransparency and fairness are key talking points ahead of the vote, given that the result of Malawis 2019 presidential election was overturned in the courts due to widespread irregularities.\n\nPolling day is Tuesday 16 September 2025.\n\nThe 7.2 million registered voters will be taking part in three elections:\n\nAFP/Getty Images Lazarus Chakwera (L) and Peter Mutharika (R) have faced each other at the ballot before\n\nAmong the 17 hopefuls there are two clear front-runners.\n\nChakwera and Mutharika will square off against each other at the polls for the fourth time  though the third time ended up not counting.\n\nMutharika first defeated Chakwera in 2014, but when he was declared winner over Chakwera in the next election in 2019 the result was annulled. Chakwera won the re-run the following year.\n\nLazarus Chakwera  Malawi Congress Party (MCP)\n\nChakwera, a former theology lecturer and preacher, had no political experience when he emerged as leader of the MCP in 2013.\n\nWhen he ran for president in 2014 he was unsuccessful, but in 2020 he triumphed,beating the incumbent, Mutharika, in that unprecedented re-run.\n\nChakweras time in office has been marred by economic turmoil and allegations of corruption. The 70-year-old did, however, reintroduce train services in Malawi for the first time in over three decades. He has also overseen major road construction across the country.\n\nPeter Mutharika  Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)\n\nMutharika, an 85-year-old former lawyer and law lecturer, led Malawi from 2014 to 2020.\n\nHe is the brother of the late President Bingu wa Mutharika, who died in office in 2012.\n\nLike Chakwera, Mutharika is also burdened by corruption allegations and links to economic crises. However, his supporters would argue that the current high inflation rate (around 27%) is proof that Mutharika managed the economy better than his successor.\n\nMutharikas age may count against him this election  speculation about his health is rife, especially as he has rarely been seen out in public during the campaign period.\n\nOther contenders garnering attention are former presidentJoyce Banda(Peoples Party), current Vice-PresidentMichael Usi(Odya Zake Alibe Mlandu)and former reserve bank governorDalitso Kabambe(UTM).\n\nThe economy\n\nMalawi has long been one of the poorest countries in the world, butthe past few years have been especially punishing.\n\nThe country wasdevastated by Cyclone Freddythat killed hundreds of people in 2023, then a drought swept across southern Africa the following year. Food prices skyrocketed due to a short supply of crops, pushing many Malawians into extreme poverty.\n\nEconomists also put Malawis current inflation problems partly down to the shortage of foreign currencies  known as forex  in the banks.\n\nIn addition, Malawi has beenforced to devalue its currencyand was recently crippled by fuel shortages and nationwide power outages.\n\nCorruption\n\nWhen Chakwera came to power, he vowed to to clear the rubble of corruption that has long plagued Malawian politics. His administration says it has excelled in this area, but critics  including the influential Catholic Church  say this is not the case.\n\nScepticism was sparked last year when the director of public prosecutions dropped corruption charges against high-profile figures.\n\nAdditionally, Malawis anti-graft agency, the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB), has been without a director since former boss Martha Chizuma left more than a year ago.\n\nTo some, the failure to appoint a new head actively hinders the fight against corruption.\n\nBut previous administrations have also been dogged by graft allegations. For instance, the ACBaccused Mutharika of receiving a kickback from a contractto supply food to the police  he denied any wrongdoing.\n\nBandas reputation was dented by a scandal dubbed cashgate which happened under her watch. She was cleared by the ACB of any wrongdoing.\n\nThe former vice-presidents death\n\nIn June last year, Vice-PresidentSaulos Chilima died in a plane crash. Popular with the youth, Chilima led the UTM party and could have been a key contender in the upcoming elections, especially as he had fallen out with the president.\n\nAlthough two investigations  one carried out by Germanys aviation accidents agency and another by a Malawi government-appointed commission  did not find evidence of foul play, some Malawians remain suspicious of the authorities.\n\nOpposition parties have been fuelling this scepticism during their campaigns, referring to Chakweras party as the Chikangawa Party (Chikangawa Forest being the site of the plane crash).\n\nAFP/Getty Images Hundreds in Malawi lost their lives to Cyclone Freddy\n\nMalawi was governed by the MCP from its independence in 1964 until the countrys first multi-party poll in 1994.\n\nSince the shift from a one-party state, the United Democratic Front, the DPP, the Peoples Party and the MCP have all enjoyed stints in power.\n\nChakweras victory with the MCP in 2020 was one of the most significant moments in the countrys political history.\n\nA general election had taken place the year before and Mutharika was declared the winner.\n\nHowever,the Constitutional Court annulled the election, saying there had been widespread tampering, including the use of Tipp-Ex correction fluid on results sheets.\n\nJudges ordered a re-run for 2020, and Chakwera won with 59% of the vote after having teamed up with Chilima.\n\nAlthough Mutharika branded the re-run unacceptable, the Constitutional Court gained international acclaim for safeguarding democracy and refusing to be influenced by presidential power.\n\nFollowing the controversy of the 2019 election, Malawi implemented a new system, where a candidate must gain more than 50% of the total votes to win the presidency in the first round.\n\nThere is a strong possibility that this years candidates will not reach this threshold in the initial poll, meaning a run-off election will have to be held.\n\nThe MCP and DPP will likely try to bring other, smaller parties on board in order to secure a majority in the second time round.\n\nThe courts actions following the 2019 vote have given some Malawians faith in the electoral process.\n\nHowever, over the past months, a number or civil society organisations and opposition parties have accused the electoral commission of favouring the MCP, alleging that its top management has links to the governing party. The commission has firmly denied being biased.\n\nA protest in June calling for the resignation of the commissions top officials was attacked by masked, machete-wielding men, leading to concerns about freedom of expression in the run-up to the election.\n\nThe assault was not an isolated incident  there have been numerous reports of politically motivated violence ahead of the general election.\n\nThe outcome of the presidential election will be announced by the end of 24 September.\n\nThe parliamentary results will be announced by the end of 30 September.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nEast and Southern Africa is regarded as a central component for organised crime, which connects regional criminal markets to global networks.\n\nThis was revealed in the Global Initiative report, which stated that the region serves as a thriving source, hub and conduit for a wide variety of illegal commodities.\n\nThese criminal syndicates operate from the shores of Somalia to border crossings and international air and sea points in Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, Mozambique, Zimbabwe, South Africa and Namibia.\n\nFor example, heroin trafficked from Afghanistan via Pakistan and Iran, is shipped across the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean by boat before it is deposited in the northern Mozambique and Tanzania.\n\nThere, according to the report titled Mapping Organised Criminal Economies in East and Southern Africa, it splits into two primary supply lines: One of higher purity bound for international markets in Europe and Australia, and another that is significantly adulterated and consumed in towns and villages across the East and Southern Africa.\n\nAccording to the report, rhino is smuggled from Johannesburg and Addis Ababa, routed through Dubai and Doha and sometimes Paris and London to throw off law enforcement.\n\nIvory departs in shipping containers from ports in Der es Salaam, Nampula and Durban, ending up in Singapore, Sihanoukville, Huangpu and Haiphong.\n\nGold is mined illegally in Zimbabwes mineral-rich Kwekwe gold fields and deep shaft mines in the towns of Krugersdorp, Carletonville, Klerksdorp and Welkom in South Africa. It is processed and eventually laundered through Dubai.\n\nThe report added that gold is also smuggled by the tonne into countries along the strife-torn Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC)s eastern border and laundered through Rwanda, Burundi, Uganda, Tanzania and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).\n\nIn the northern Mozambique and KwaZulu-Natal province, Islamic State-aligned insurgents and supporters have been implicated in criminal economies, gold smuggling, and kidnapping and extortion schemes to raise funds.\n\nThe region has attracted a coterie of international criminal players, according to the report.\n\nFor instance, networks from China, Pakistan and Iran are known to interface with African intermediaries for drug trafficking (drug precursor chemicals, methamphetamine and heroin) and wildlife smuggling (notably of abalone and ivory). In Southern Africa, Nigerian and Congolese syndicates, often operating from hubs such as Johannesburg, coordinate regional drug distribution and financial fraud schemes while also connecting to global diaspora networks.\n\nThe report added that this chaotic mixture of different criminal commodities and networks is, in many ways, shaped by geography and coalesces around a spiders web of regional hubs and economic centres.\n\nEnvironmental, social and regional dynamics in hinterlands allow warlords and smugglers to thrive, while bustling trade hubs provide cover for clandestine flows and access to key transport links.\n\nIn urban slums, neglected towns and remote rural communities, criminal actors and parallel illicit economies rapidly fill the void left by an often absent state. Ancient trade and migratory routes over mountains and along rivers and coastlines that long pre-date colonial borders allow for the largely untrammelled movement of people and goods, both licit and illicit. This means many of these trafficking networks and criminal groups are found concentrated in certain illicit hubs, reads the report.\n\nCrime expert at the Institute for Security Studies (ISS), Willem Els, added that poor governance is one of the reasons behind the challenges in the region andallows the situation to get out of control.\n\nIf you look at criminality levels, you will see that South Africa is number one in the region and number three in the continent. It is also number seven in the world. That means we created an environment that is conducive for organised crime to thrive. And one of the main factors is the State-embedded actors because none of these criminal syndicates can effectively survive without the protection of politicians and without the compromising of senior officials, Els said.\n\nHe said South Africa is rapidly approaching a failed State scenario where the rule of law is completely crumbled.\n\nSouth Africa is also suffering because of corruption, infrastructure, weak border controls and financial systems, and criminals are exploiting that, he said.\n\nThe report added that the Gauteng province is arguably the most significant organised crime hub in Southern Africa.\n\nAs the regions economic heart, with excellent transport links (notably airports and highways) and financial infrastructure, Johannesburg attracts many criminal enterprises. It is a crucial distribution centre for drugs (heroin arriving from East Africa and cocaine direct from Latin America or via West Africa) destined for local consumption or re-export.\n\nSouth African law enforcement notes that domestic and foreign drug trafficking syndicates converge in Johannesburg  for instance, Nigerian networks base themselves there to manage Southern African operations and South Asian cartel operatives have been detected collaborating with local crime bosses.\n\nJohannesburg is also a central hub for human smuggling and trafficking rings: victims from poorer African countries (including Malawi, Mozambique and Lesotho) are brought to the citys informal brothels and labour markets, while the citys international airport serves as a transit point for traffickers moving people to Europe or the Middle East.\n\nCape Town, according to the report, is a hub for the narcotics trade, a market associated with gang activity, while Northern KwaZulu-Natal is a strategic location.\n\nWeak border controls and existing criminal networks make it a prime hub for various forms of organised crime.\n\n",
