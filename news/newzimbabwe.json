Taxes paid for the period under review, including Excise Duty, Corporate Tax, VAT, Customs Duties, PAYE and Withholding Tax, which came to a total of over USD8.1 million, he said.\n\nDespite the contribution, the company faced operational challenges. Sales volumes fell by 14%, largely due to weaker consumer spending and broader macroeconomic headwinds. Revenue also declined by 28%, dropping from US$18.1 million to US$13 million compared to the same period last year. The fall was attributed to constrained consumer incomes, a tough trading environment, and a shift in pricing strategy from ZWG to US$.\n\nCosts, however, moved in the opposite direction. The cost of sales rose by 31%, climbing to US$4.1 million from US$3.4 million in 2024, driven mainly by higher raw material prices.\n\nDespite these pressures, BAT recorded a profit before tax of US$6.6 million, a marked recovery from the US$10.6 million loss posted during the same period last year.\n\nZimbabwes ability to navigate the ever-changing macro-economic landscape and deliver long-term value to all stakeholders. Our optimism is grounded in the resilience of our people, our brands and unwavering commitment to innovation and transformation, added Manatsa.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nLawyers representing NetOne CEO Raphael Mushanawani have written to the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) demanding his immediate release, insisting their client is the victim of a calculated power grab within the organisation.\n\nMushanawani was arrested Monday on fraud allegations involving US$1.2 million. However, his legal team claims the charges are fabricated by rivals seeking to force him out, using the names of influential politicians to strengthen their plot.\n\nIn a letter dated September 30, 2025, and seen byNewZimbabwe.com, Mushanawanis lawyer Admire Rubaya argued that the arrest was unlawful, describing his client as being punished for doing things right at the parastatal.\n\nRubaya alleged that ZACC had been misled, insisting that all the CEOs actions were above board and backed by board approval, contrary to claims that he engaged companies without authorisation.\n\nThere are certain individuals who are targeting his post who have approached you (ZACC) on the basis of name dropping very powerful individuals who sit in the high echelons of power and politics in this country yet there is no involvement of any such political figures. The grand plan is for these instigators to take over as the people at the helm of NetOne, the letter states.\n\nZACC accuses Mushanawani of breaching company procedures by secretly engaging Lunartech Solutions (Pvt) Ltd to upgrade NetOnes SAGE 1000 system, which was meant to be replaced under a separate US$3.5 million contract awarded to Farevic Systems (Pvt) Ltd in 2022.\n\nThe commission alleges that Mushanawani did so without the approval of the Executive Committee or the Board.\n\nHowever, his lawyers insist the upgrade was necessary, approved at the board level, and vital to safeguard NetOnes operations.\n\nOur client is at a loss as to why he finds himself languishing in police custody over an issue which exposes your officers lack of understanding of IT systems, the lawyers wrote.\n\nThey explained that the SAP ERP system being implemented by Farevic was distinct from the SAGE 1000 system NetOne had been using for years. SAGE had reached its end-of-sale stage, with support from its South African vendor scheduled to end on December 31, 2024, creating what they said was a significant operational risk.\n\nContrary to your claims, the upgrading of the SAGE ERP 1000 to SAGE L200 was imperative  This was key and had been approved by the board, the lawyers said.\n\nThey further argued that both systems had to run in parallel until the new one was proven fully functional.\n\nThe lawyers also rejected claims that Mushanawani signed addenda worth US$1.2 million to upgrade the SAGE system.\n\nThis is false, and you are challenged to provide such evidence. For your information, the only payments which have been made thus far are for US$184,800 and US$88,002.57, the letter reads.\n\nThey equally dismissed allegations that Mushanawani entered into an unapproved consultancy contract with Diztech (Pvt) Ltd for US$79,467.\n\nFor the record, there is no contract that was signed between Diztech (Pvt) Ltd and NetOne as alleged, neither has there been any payment of even a dime to Diztech (Pvt) Ltd  since no such services were ever provided, the lawyers said.\n\nMushanawanis defence team maintains that the allegations are part of a deliberate campaign to oust him from his position. They attached board documents to support their case and warned ZACC against being used in what they called an orchestrated plot.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nPolice at Ritavi, in Limpopo, have launched a manhunt for two suspects after a series of violent incidents at schools in the area, which left one suspect dead, another arrested, and several items stolen.\n\nAccording to provincial police spokesperson Colonel Malesela Ledwaba, between midnight and 4 am on Sunday, three armed suspects targeted three schools in the Ritavi policing area. The gang stole cellphones and laptops and attempted to break into an administration block at one of the schools around 3 am.\n\nThe on-duty security guard became suspicious and confronted the suspects. Police said the suspects opened fire in the guards direction before fleeing.\n\nThe guard later discovered one of the suspects lying on the ground with a gunshot wound. Paramedics certified the suspect dead at the scene. A post-mortem will be conducted to determine the exact cause of death, said Ledwaba.\n\nThe provincial murder and robbery unit, together with the Mopani tracking team, attended the scene and identified the deceased as a 36-year-old man from Seshego. The deceased is also reported to be a Zimbabwean national.\n\nFurther investigations led to the tracing of a vehicle allegedly used in the crimes. The driver, a 41-year-old man from Seshego, was arrested and is due to appear in the Nkowankowa Magistrates Court on Tuesday.\n\nPolice confirmed that two suspects remain at large and are actively being pursued.\n\nSAPS has urged anyone with information on the outstanding suspects to contact investigating officer Sergeant Eric Mathebula on 083 239 0977, call theCrime Stop number 08600 10111, report to the nearest police station, or use the My SAPS App.\n\n",
