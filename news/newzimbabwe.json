Even in our early days, when resources were limited, we made it a point to support the elderly, children, and persons with disabilities. We are a community-oriented company, and this campaign is simply a continuation of that journey.\n\nThrough the 2025 Charity Campaign,Diaspora Insurancehopes not only to touch lives but also to inspire others to give.\n\nDiaspora Insurance is widely recognised for its work within African and other diaspora communities across the UK, Europe, North America, and beyond.

We clearly told them we were simply conducting ZINASU campaigns, which had nothing to do with ZANU PF.\n\nDear Mr MnangagwaThis is why this evil must be fought for as long as is necessary, . even for the rest of our lives or with our own lives. This is wrong in all material respects!pic.twitter.com/Kau1kuozeZ\n\n nelson chamisa (@nelsonchamisa)November 11, 2025\n\nChamisa compared the attack to atrocities committed under the late former president Robert Mugabe, saying the current wave of repression was even worse.\n\nDuring Mugabes long tenure, opposition activists were routinely abducted, tortured and killed for being critical of his administration and ruling party.\n\nWriting on X, Chamisa said: Dear @PoliceZimbabwe, why should this terrorism and primitive brutality on harmless students and innocent citizens be allowed to continue? Mr Mnangagwa, why should this not worry or concern you? Mugabe was bad. This is worse. So barbaric. This is pure evil!\n\nMeanwhile, human rights organisation Amnesty International has called for a thorough investigation into the attack and urged authorities to protect students rights to peaceful assembly and association.\n\nThese attacks threaten not just freedoms of assembly, expression, and association, but also the rights to education, non-discrimination, academic freedom, and participation in university public life.\n\nWe urge the authorities to thoroughly investigate these attacks and ensure that students can exercise their freedom of expression and peaceful assembly without fear of reprisals, intimidation, or torture, Amnesty International said in a statement.\n\n",

Other projects, such as the Mabvuku Interchange in Harare, are also underway.\n\nSpeaking at a recent media engagement, Goromonzi West legislator Biatah Nyamupinga, who sits on the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Transport and Infrastructure Development, said her committee is committed to advocating for increased allocations to the Transport Ministry as the country prepares for the 2026 National Budget.\n\nAs we approach the budget process, our committee commits to pushing for a reasonable allocation to the Transport Ministry. They need adequate resources to complete the ongoing road projects. The Ministry is doing a commendable job, and we are seeing progress across the country. Lets ensure these roads are completed, she said.\n\nNyamupinga urged the Transport Ministry to openly communicate any challenges it faces so Parliament can channel them to the relevant authorities for redress.\n\nShe also called on contractors to adhere to agreed timelines.\n\nIn some of the areas we have visited, contractors promised to complete their projects by March next year. Lets ensure those targets are met. Delivering on time will strengthen our case when we lobby for bigger allocations. We can then proudly say contractors are delivering the work they were paid for, she added.\n\nDue to high infrastructure demands, the Transport Ministry reportedly exceeded its 2024 national budget allocation by 245% within six months, prompting fresh calls for supplementary funding to sustain projects until year-end.\n\n",

Founded by Dennis Ruf, who is also the co-founder of Swiss-Zim Heritage Gallery,Artgal.Onlinechampions Zimbabwean art and artists, offering insight into both the rich creative traditions of the country, and the dialogues that arise when juxtaposed with other international contexts. Two upcoming exhibitions facilitated by Artgal.Online present an opportunity to explore Zimbabwean and other contemporary African art.\n\nDebuting November 28, 2025, is Heritage & Horizons, which can be viewed both online and in-person in Berlin, with exact venue details forthcoming. Exhibiting Zimbabwean artists within the milieu of Berlins own robust art scene invites dialogue around how history, heritage, and material exploration influence and inform artmaking today across countries and cultures.\n\nKeith Zenda,From Seeds to Strength(2025). Courtesy of Artgal.Online.\n\nBerlin marks both an end and a beginning said Ruf, Heritage & Horizons closes our 2025 season by bridging continents through artaffirming that heritage is living, transforming, and shared. It leads directly into our next chapter as we deepen our roots and widen our horizons.\n\nHeritage & Horizons includes both figurative and abstract works, ranging from mixed-media compositions from Flatter Zenda to a painting by Barry Lungu, whose compositions elevate everyday moments to near mythos.\n\nFlatter Zenda,The Ties that Bind Us(2025). Courtesy of Artgal.Online.\n\nOur artists carry stories that travelthrough color, texture, and symbol, Ruf added, in Berlin we celebrate that journey, and with the Artgal Zim Center we create a home for it: a place to learn, mentor, archive and dream, so the next generation can stand taller.\n\nLater in the year, Artgal.Online and Swiss-Zim Heritage will jointly stage Roots & Horizons  Christmas Edition, a seasonal show that platforms artists whose work reflects the diverse facets of heritage, identity, and spiritual renewal. Viewable online as well as at the Art84 Gallery in Zimbabwes capital city of Harare, the exhibition promises visitors a sweeping look at how Zimbabwean artistsboth established and emergingengage with their ancestral roots to find new pathways forward into the future.\n\nRoots & Horizons  Christmas Edition is more than an exhibition, said Ruf, its a reflection of gratitude. As the year closes, we celebrate the artists who remind us of where we come from and the possibilities ahead. This season, we wanted to bring art closer to everyoneonline and in personbecause art unites us. It transcends borders and, like the holidays, invites warmth and shared humanity.\n\nFrom realistic canvases by Nokuthula Mpofu and otherworldly portraits by Florah Maphosa to photorealistic drawings by Willard Mujuru and fantastical scenes painted by Keith Zenda, the exhibition traverses subject and medium to bring to life a comprehensive artistic world of possibility.\n\n",
