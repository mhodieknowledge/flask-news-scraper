            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe Health Law Policy (HLPC) working together with the Institute for Young Womens Development (IYWD) is pushing for amendment of the abortion law in Zimbabwe to create a safe abortion environment for women and girls.\n\nThis comes at a time when unsafe pregnancy terminations are largely contributing to maternal deaths in the country amid issues of stigma and criminalisation of abortion.\n\nZimbabwe is currently relying on the Termination of Pregnancy Act enacted in 1977.\n\nThe Act allows abortion in specific circumstances, which the two organisations feel are not broad enough to allow safe abortions.\n\nHLPC programmes coordinator Dorcas Chitiyo told NewZimbabwe.com on the sidelines of a media sensitisation training held over the weekend, that there is a need to move with the times and create a safe environment for abortions in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe issue that we are grappling with is that there are many barriers that women face, that are in existence, that are prohibiting access to safe abortions.\n\nWe start with our legal framework, that is the Termination of Pregnancy Act of 1977.\n\nIt creates challenges for women because it has very restricted grounds on which abortion is legalmaybe a woman is a survivor of a sexually violent offence or rape resulting in pregnancy, a crime of incest or in the event that it has been recommended by a doctor that the pregnancy continuation is not safe for the child as well as the quality of life for the child is anticipated to be so poor that termination is recommended by a medical practitioner.\n\nNow given that this act is from 1977, there have been many medical advances and much research and a lot of work done to ensure that abortions are accessed safely through medical procedures and medically without the need of always resorting to surgical processes, she said.\n\nChitiyo said the reality is that women currently have to resort to only seeking legal abortion in a few instances but this does not mean that abortion is not happening.\n\nWhere there are restrictions, what this simply does is it puts abortion underground. It leads to clandestine work that can endanger the life of women, it can endanger their quality of life. It might compromise their future \n\nSo we are saying there is a challenge in the environment we are operating in because of this criminalisation where a person who commits an abortion can be imprisoned for up to five years, she added.\n\nUnder the current law, a person who assists with an abortion can also be imprisoned.\n\nAccording to Chitiyo, there is a lot of stigma, and there are a lot of dangers that are associated with that environment which is restricted.\n\nWe are calling for change, where we say the grounds upon which abortions are allowed in Zimbabwe are broadened to factor in mental health, social economic considerations.\n\nWe are calling for the law to be amended. Our existing law of 1977 is way out of date. It needs to catch up with the present time.\n\nShe said even when abortion grounds are available a woman has to go through so many processes and many permissions, a situation which has to be changed.\n\nHLPC and ITYD have since come up with a position paper on safe abortion highlighting the issues mentioned above among other things.\n\nThe position paper argues that the time for reform towards access to legal and safe abortion in Zimbabwe is now.\n\nThe civic society organisations are working with support from the Safe Abortion Action Fund (SAAF).\n\nThe two organisations said Zimbabwe has one of the highest rates of contraceptive use in Sub-Saharan Africa but also one of the highest maternal mortality ratios in the world.\n\nIt has been observed that there are disparities in access to sexual and reproductive health care across age groups.\n\nA high unmet need for contraceptives has been consistently observed among unmarried and adolescent women.\n\nThese gaps in Zimbabwes family planning program leave women at risk of experiencing an unintended pregnancy and abortion, they said.\n\nIn 2016, an estimated 65,300 induced abortions occurred in Zimbabwe.\n\nThis translates to a rate of 17 abortions for every 1,000women aged 1549.\n\n",

            "content": "Reuters\n\nThe Democratic Republic of Congo has filed criminal complaints against Apple subsidiaries in France and Belgium, accusing the tech firm of using conflict minerals in its supply chain, lawyers for the Congolese government told Reuters.\n\nCongo is a major source of tin, tantalum and tungsten, so-called 3T minerals used in computers and mobile phones. But some artisanal mines are run by armed groups involved in massacres of civilians, mass rapes, looting and other crimes, according to U.N. experts and human rights groups.\n\nApple does not directly source primary minerals and says it audits suppliers, publishes findings and funds bodies that seek to improve mineral traceability.\n\nApple last year said it had no reasonable basis for concluding its products contain illegally exported minerals from conflict-hit zones. The tech giant has insisted it carefully verifies the origin of materials in its output.\n\nIts 2023 filing on conflict minerals to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said none of the smelters or refiners of 3T minerals or gold in its supply chain had financed or benefited armed groups in Congo or neighboring countries.\n\nBut international lawyers representing Congo argue that Apple uses minerals pillaged from Congo and laundered through international supply chains, which they say renders the firm complicit in crimes taking place in Congo.\n\nIn parallel complaints filed to the Paris prosecutors office and to a Belgian investigating magistrates office on Monday, Congo accuses local subsidiaries Apple France, Apple Retail France and Apple Retail Belgium of a range of offenses.\n\nThese include covering up war crimes and the laundering of tainted minerals, handling stolen goods, and carrying out deceptive commercial practices to assure consumers supply chains are clean.\n\nIt is clear that the Apple group, Apple France and Apple Retail France know very well that their minerals supply chain relies on systemic wrongdoing, says the French complaint, after citing U.N. and rights reports on conflict in east Congo.\n\nBelgium had a particular moral duty to act because looting of Congos resources began during the 19th-century colonial rule of its King Leopold II, Congos Belgian lawyer Christophe Marchand said.\n\nIt is incumbent on Belgium to help Congo in its effort to use judicial means to end the pillaging, he said.\n\nThe complaints, prepared by the lawyers on behalf of Congos justice minister, make allegations not just against the local subsidiaries but against the Apple group as a whole.\n\nFrance and Belgium were chosen because of their perceived strong emphasis on corporate accountability. Judicial authorities in both nations will decide whether to investigate the complaints further and bring criminal charges.\n\nIn an unrelated case in March, a U.S. federal court rejected an attempt by private plaintiffs to hold Apple, Google, Tesla, Dell and Microsoft accountable for what the plaintiffs described as their dependence on child labor in Congolese cobalt mines.\n\nMinerals fuel violence\n\nSince the 1990s, Congos mining heartlands in the east have been devastated by waves of fighting between armed groups, some backed by neighboring Rwanda, and the Congolese military.\n\nMillions of civilians have died and been displaced.\n\nCompetition for minerals is one of the main drivers of conflict as armed groups sustain themselves and buy weapons with the proceeds of exports, often smuggled via Rwanda, according to U.N. experts and human rights organizations.\n\nRwanda denies benefiting from the trade, dismissing the allegations as unfounded.\n\nAmong the appendices to Congos legal complaint in France was a statement issued by the U.S. State Department in July, expressing concerns about the role of the illicit trade in minerals from Congo, including tantalum, in financing conflict.\n\nThe statement was a response to requests from the private sector for the U.S. government to clarify potential risks associated with manufacturing products using minerals extracted, transported or exported from eastern Congo, Rwanda and Uganda.\n\nCongos complaints focus on ITSCI, a metals industry-funded monitoring and certification scheme designed to help companies perform due diligence on suppliers of 3T minerals exported from Congo, Rwanda, Burundi and Uganda.\n\nCongos lawyers argue that ITSCI has been discredited, including by the Responsible Minerals Initiative (RMI) of which Apple is a member, and that Apple nevertheless uses ITSCI as a fig leaf to falsely present its supply chain as clean.\n\nThe RMI, whose members include more than 500 companies, announced in 2022 it was removing ITSCI from its list of approved traceability schemes.\n\nIn July, it said it was prolonging the suspension until at least 2026, saying ITSCI had not provided field observations from high-risk sites or explained how it was responding to an escalation of violence in North Kivu province, which borders Rwanda and is a key 3T mining area.\n\nITSCI criticized the RMIs own processes and defended its work in Congo as reliable. It has also rejected allegations in a 2022 report by campaigning group Global Witness entitled The ITSCI Laundromat, cited in Congos legal complaint in France, that it was complicit in the false labeling of minerals from conflict zones as coming from mines located in peaceful areas.\n\nApple mentioned ITSCI five times in its 2023 filing on conflict minerals. The filing also made multiple mentions of the RMI, in which Apple said it had continued active participation and leadership but did not mention the RMIs ditching of ITSCI.\n\nIn its July statement, the U.S. State Department said flaws in traceability schemes have not garnered sufficient engagement and attention to lead to changes needed.\n\nRobert Amsterdam, a U.S.-based lawyer for Congo, said the French and Belgian complaints were the first criminal complaints by the Congolese state against a major tech company, describing them as a first salvo only.\n\nSome information for this report came from Agence France-Presse.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFormer Harare Mayor Hebert Gomba has called on President Emmerson Mnangagwa to declare the contamination of Lake Chivero a state of national disaster, in order to solve the whole array of challenges caused by the water poisoning.\n\nChivero is the primary source of water for Harare residents.\n\nThe contamination of Lake Chivero has been topical this week following an expos by NewZimbabwe.com investigative reporter Mary Taruvinga over the weekend.\n\nBefore this four white rhinos alongside other wildlife, livestock and birds had been reported dead by the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Management Authority (ZimParks).\n\nZimParks said tests had established that the deaths occurred after the animals drank cyanobacteria-contaminated water.\n\nThe contamination was widely caused by a continuous discharge of raw sewage into the lake by Harare City Council.\n\nRELATED:\n\nA visit to the lake showed it had been heavily contaminated and thousands of fish had also died.\n\nA stretch of over a kilometre inspected by the reporter was covered with layers of rotting fish and some fish was captured dying.\n\nThe water had turned green following an algae bloom and had become smelly.\n\nA stench smell of rotting fish and sewage-infested water engulfed the environs of the lake.\n\nIn an X Space discussion Wednesday night Gomba said the work that now lies in the way of Harare City Council is beyond its capacity to deal with and requires the governments attention.\n\nThe politician also said the city can not be blamed for what is unfolding.\n\nThe City needs to be assisted. But it needs to be done in conformity with the law.\n\nMy proposal is for the president to declare a state of national disaster.\n\nRehabilitation of infrastructure should be from the source. The whole distribution system should be refurbished.\n\nIt has been a disaster for too long hence we need a holistic approach and declare this a national disaster.\n\nThe whole system has decayed. We need the whole system to be revamped, he said.\n\nGomba also blamed the late long-time ruler Robert Mugabe for failing to handle the situation from the time he came into power.\n\nWho is to blame? The late former president Robert Mugabe, the ministers who were working with Robert Mugabe whether dead or alive, even if they are holding certain offices now.\n\nGomba said Mugabes government was supposed to construct the Kunzvi and Musami dams, which were supposed to be completed by 1990 but these projects failed.\n\nWe should blame the government.\n\nFrom 1980 to now it has failed to run these affairsHarare was supposed to get water from Kunzvi and Musami so that Chivero could be decommissioned for cleaning.\n\nThe City Council was not able to decommission Lake Chivero because Kunzvi was not built. It was supposed to be built in 1990, he said.\n\nGomba said now more money is needed to solve the situation.\n\nWe need a huge investment into our infrastructure for our water and sewer system\n\nNorton also needs a sewer system plan so that they dont discharge into Darwendale.\n\nThat takes a lot of money, he said.\n\nThe government has since banned fishing operations in Lake Chivero to give space for investigations.\n\nHarare Mayor Jacob Mafume on Tuesday told journalists that they will have a way forward after a fact-finding visit which was scheduled for Wednesday.\n\nZimParks has since relocated the remaining rhinos from Lake Chivero Recreational Park to a safer place among other precautionary measures.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFOR the second consecutive month, the government has failed to pay its employees, including teachers, their meagre salaries on time exacerbating suffering among the working class.\n\nMost civil servants were supposed to have their salaries reflected in their accounts this week, but nothing has come as the Christmas holiday fast approaches.\n\nLast month, November, some teachers among other government workers got late disbursements of their Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) payments while the United States dollar component of their salaries and bonuses never reflected in their accounts.\n\nThe Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) made the claims in a post on social media this Wednesday, stating that civil servants were wallowing in abject poverty amid continued neglect by their employer.\n\nFor the second month in a row, the Zimbabwean government has failed to pay civil servants salaries on time. Civil servants are already earning paltry salaries and are battling to make ends meet.\n\nFestive season was struck off the calendar of government workers way back. Unfortunately, the late payment of salaries adds a new layer of pain to the exploited government employees. Failing to meet the basics for survival when others are swimming in plenty is torturous, said ARTUZ.\n\nThe teachers representative body alleges top bureaucrats were now enjoying the fruits of their manipulative conduct, which saw them suppressing dissent among impoverished public service employees.\n\nSenior government officials have since received their big perks in United States dollars. The majority of these elites are now on holiday with their families claiming to be resting from a busy year.\n\nIndeed it was a busy year for them. Looting from the impoverished is not an easy job. Working round the clock to silence the oppressed and disenfranchised majority is not an easy task. But as they rest they should be assured that the underpaid civil servants will not be silenced forever.\n\nARTUZ said its members had endured enough unfair labour practices and warned of protests to demand improved pay and working conditions. Teachers are demanding at least US$1 260 per month from an average of US$300.\n\nWe are not in the habit of making empty threats. The anger from the civil servants is reaching the boiling point. 2025 will be a difficult year for those who steal from the poor. We will organize and demand fair wages paid on time, ARTUZ said.\n\n",

From here we start our work.\n\nI would refer to the engineers and people doing the construction but we are going to do things in phases. We are going to take things one step at a time but immediately we are going to begin the construction of a clubhouse and a practice pitch, said Sakupwanya.\n\nNumber 1 Ground holds historic significance, having produced football legends such as Brenna Musiska, Joel Mugabe, and Cephas Chimedza, among others.\n\nHowever, the official handover of the ground was marked by the conspicuous absence of senior Harare officials.\n\nThis has raised questions about the City Councils full support, as it has traditionally overseen the ownership of recreational facilities in Harare.\n\nSakupwanya said the project will be a multipurpose facility housing different sports codes.\n\nHere is going to be not only a stadium. It will be a facility housing football pitches l, cricket, swimming pools, and stores to sell. We are just reviving and revitalising. It is a big project, he said.\n\n",
