Its a frivolous legal application, he wrote.In July the U.S. deported five individuals from Vietnam, Jamaica, Laos, Cuba and Yemen to the Southern African country. All were convicted felons, and Eswatini says it is holding them in solitary confinement until they can be repatriated.The applicants in the case, led by the Eswatini Litigation Centre, say that the agreement made with the U.S. was illegal because it was not submitted to Parliament for approval and the terms were not disclosed.They also say they do not know the condition of the deportees because no one has been allowed access to them.We want the executive to be held accountable, we want transparency dealing with matters of state importance, (and) respect for the rights of all individuals who are in Eswatini regardless of who they may be, said lead applicant and lawyer Mzwandile Masuku.Eswatini, an absolute monarchy ruled by King Mswati III, has previously said the deportees pose no threat and that the agreement was based purely on its good relations with Washington.The International Organization for Migration told Reuters it had received a request from Eswatini to provide post-arrival assistance for the deportees, but did not say whether it would accept or what that might entail.We are discussing with Government of Eswatini, their request, a spokesperson for the U.N. agency said on Thursday.Trump aims to deport millions of immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally and his administration has sought to increase removals to third countries.Additional reporting and writing by Nellie Peyton; Editing by Toby Chopra.\n\nThe case was due be heard at the High Court of Eswatini on Friday, but was postponed until September 25 because the government did not file response papers, the lead applicant told Reuters outside the court on Friday.\n\nEswatinis Attorney General Sifiso Khumalo said in a text message that the case had no legal basis.

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nTHE Womens Academy for Leadership and Political Excellence (WALPE) and its partners have engaged Parliamentarians as they lobby for a motion on the Unpaid Care and Domestic Work (UCDW) Bill.\n\nWALPE, together with the Zimbabwe Womens Parliamentary Caucus, developed the motion to ease the burden of unpaid care and domestic work on women and girls through the enactment of a national care policy.Parliament, through Clerk Kennedy Chokuda, has accepted the motion, confirming its readiness for debate and noting that it is in the correct format and will positively impact womens lives in Zimbabwe.According to WALPE, an official date will soon be announced for members to debate the motion in the House.The proposed law calls for the recognition of UCDW as legitimate work and seeks to ensure that womens contributions to the economy are acknowledged and supported.Speaking during a workshop with MPs and Senators in Harare recently, WALPE Executive Director Sitabile Dewa said unpaid care and domestic work falls mainly on womens shoulders, limiting their participation in the paid economy and in society.By recognising unpaid care and domestic work as legitimate work, the Bill acknowledges the valuable contributions women make to their families and communities, she said.Dewa highlighted WALPEs six-year journey of advancing the UCDW agenda, which includes conducting national research, producing academic papers and newspaper opinion pieces, developing knowledge management toolkits, and using testimonials and documentaries to capture the lived experiences of women and girls.During the same workshop, the Zimbabwe Womens Parliamentary Caucus, led by Chairperson Maybe Mbohwa, and supported by male MPs and Senators, urged Parliamentarians to rally behind the Bill once it is introduced in both houses.Over the years, WALPE has also facilitated cross-country learning and advocacy. A leadership learning visit to Kenya brought together stakeholders including the Womens Parliamentary Caucus, the Ministry of Women Affairs, the Zimbabwe Gender Commission, Padare Mens Forum on Gender, Bekezela Home-Based Care and the Mayor of Harare to exchange strategies on UCDW policy reform. The delegation gained valuable lessons from Kenyas development of a National UCDW Policy.In 2024, WALPE presented a Gender-Responsive Public Services Dummy Budget Proposal alongside the national budget process, urging government to invest in public services that recognise, reduce and redistribute unpaid care work.WALPE has also hosted forums with private sector stakeholders, in partnership with Padare, to advocate for collective action in reducing and redistributing UCDW.The lobby groups work has been supported by Oxfam and IDRC/CRDI to ensure communities understand the importance of UCDW policies and their role in achieving gender equality and economic justice.\n\nWALPE, together with the Zimbabwe Womens Parliamentary Caucus, developed the motion to ease the burden of unpaid care and domestic work on women and girls through the enactment of a national care policy.\n\nParliament, through Clerk Kennedy Chokuda, has accepted the motion, confirming its readiness for debate and noting that it is in the correct format and will positively impact womens lives in Zimbabwe.According to WALPE, an official date will soon be announced for members to debate the motion in the House.The proposed law calls for the recognition of UCDW as legitimate work and seeks to ensure that womens contributions to the economy are acknowledged and supported.Speaking during a workshop with MPs and Senators in Harare recently, WALPE Executive Director Sitabile Dewa said unpaid care and domestic work falls mainly on womens shoulders, limiting their participation in the paid economy and in society.By recognising unpaid care and domestic work as legitimate work, the Bill acknowledges the valuable contributions women make to their families and communities, she said.Dewa highlighted WALPEs six-year journey of advancing the UCDW agenda, which includes conducting national research, producing academic papers and newspaper opinion pieces, developing knowledge management toolkits, and using testimonials and documentaries to capture the lived experiences of women and girls.During the same workshop, the Zimbabwe Womens Parliamentary Caucus, led by Chairperson Maybe Mbohwa, and supported by male MPs and Senators, urged Parliamentarians to rally behind the Bill once it is introduced in both houses.Over the years, WALPE has also facilitated cross-country learning and advocacy.
