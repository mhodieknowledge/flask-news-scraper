            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nZANU PF Mbire District Coordinating Committee chairman in Mashonaland Central province, Takesure Chikwamba has been accused of orchestrating the arrest of former Agriculture deputy minister Douglas Karoro on theft charges.\n\nThe move was allegedly driven by revenge after Chikwamba lost the Mbire Constituency to Karoro in the 2018 harmonised elections.\n\nThis came out in court this Thursday when Chikwamba appeared as a State witness against Karoro who is accused of diverting fertilisers that were meant for Mbire district under the Presidential Input Programme.\n\nThe former deputy minister, who is being represented by Admire Rubaya, denies the allegations, describing them as a fabrication by his political rivals, among them Chikwamba, whom he outclassed in the partys primary elections to represent the constituency in parliament.\n\nChikwamba told Regional Magistrate Marehwanazvo Gofa that he reported the matter to the police after he received reports from his party subordinates of suspicious movement of fertilisers at GMB Mushumbi.\n\nHe said he was not in Mbire at the time but was at his home in Ruwa when he was informed about the movement of fertilisers at Mushumbi GMB depot heading to Guruve GMB and rushed to the Police Morris Depot to report.\n\nWhen I got information from Nawo Gumbo and Mutukudzi about the fertilisers I got in touch with intelligence officers from the Presidents office. I also made investigations at GMB Guruve, where I was told there was no ammonium nitrate which was said to be going to be exchanged with compound D which had been taken at Mushumbi.\n\nWe expected the compound D would be returned but it was never delivered to the people of Mbire, he said.\n\nThe defence argued that Chikwamba had no locus standi to receive information at GMB and this shows he had a motive to get back at Karoro who had beaten him in elections.\n\nThey argued that in pursuit of his vendetta, Chikwamba rushed to the police despite not having any evidence but just words from his security officers on the ground.\n\nThey added that Chikwamba never called Karoro to inquire about the allegations but rushed to the police as he had the intention to sink him.\n\nYou had ulterior motives; that is why you did not call him to ascertain whether it was true or not. You just concluded he was a thief and rushed to report without even hearing his side of the story, Rubaya argued.\n\nChikwamba responded, saying he went to the police because he had been told a whistleblower whom he could not name was processing documents at GMB to substantiate the allegations against the former legislator.\n\nThe defence insisted the allegations were a fabrication as they were not supported by evidence, adding that the report was not even made where the alleged offence occurred.\n\nThey said Chikwamba ignored his nearest police stations, Ruwa, Mabvuku and Harare Central and instead rushed to CCD, which ordinarily gets reports through referrals.\n\nThis, they said, showed malice and an intention to get back at Karoro because he had a bone to chew with the accused for defeating them in the elections.\n\nYou were determined to be in the new building in Mt Hampden (parliament) that you sought to have him dismissed through baseless allegations. You ignored all the police stations and just rushed to Morris Depot, now Mkushi Depot, Rubaya said.\n\nChikwamba said he was not bitter after losing the election to Karoro but instead he was happy because it was a learning curve and first time to compete, adding that Karoro was just raising it as a defence to the allegations.\n\nHearing continues next Thursday.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nBorn in 1991 as the youngest and only son in a family of three, Tanaka Tank Mupfurutsa has remained steadfast in his pursuit of business success, undeterred by the unpredictable highs and lows of entrepreneurship.\n\nWhile his siblings have sought opportunities abroad, Mupfurutsa chose to stay in Zimbabwe, founding Apex Travel Zimbabwe, a premier travel and tours operator among other business ventures.\n\nHe continues to navigate the countrys challenging economic terrain with courage and determination, all while supporting his family and building a name for himself in the local business landscape.\n\nAt just 19 years old, he launched Black Bean Investments, a candle and maputi (puffed maize snack) manufacturing company  laying the foundation for a bigger vision.\n\nIn an interview withNewZimbabwe.com, Mupfurutsa shares his successes and sorrows, highlighting the guiding principle behind his resilience: Keep changing. Nothing will work without God in it.\n\nIt was not easy, he said, recalling his encounters with the police after overloading his car with maputi but this did not deter him from achieving his goals.\n\nInstead, they became anecdotes of persistence and hustle.\n\nMupfurutsa invested in his own maputi machines. Scaling up, he was processing tonnes of maize and supplying major retailers.\n\nA milestone came when he landed a contract with Afro Foods, distributing 10,000 packets three times a week to over 15 retail outlets around Harare City. The business later suffered due to the collapse of Afro Foods but he remained undeterred.\n\nWhile pursuing a Business Studies and Computing Science degree at the University of Zimbabwe (graduated 2013), Mupfurutsa co-founded Campus Culture, where he served as finance director.\n\nThe student-led enterprise published magazines, hosted events, and even represented the university in a national ICT innovation competition.\n\nDespite multiple job offers, including from Delta Beverages and Document Support Centre, he chose entrepreneurship  the less-travelled path, and that was the birth of Apex Travel.\n\nApex Travel was formally registered in 2014 as an educational tours company.With unwavering zeal, Mupfurutsa and his team visited over ten schools daily, earning the trust of clients one handshake at a time.\n\nApex Travel grew into a leading brand, known for luxurious and unforgettable school trips. The company revolutionised the industry by offering high-end experiences to studentsluxury coach rides, five-star hotel stays, and fully guided educational experiences.\n\nOne of Apex Travels historic achievements was chartering a full Boeing aircraft through Fly Africa, taking 140 students from Haig Park Primary School to Victoria Falls.\n\nAnother proud moment came when Apex Travel booked out the entire Caribbea Bay Hotel for a school tour. Apex became a household name in schools across Zimbabwe and was known for setting industry trends.\n\nThe business expanded rapidly: Apex now included car rental, vehicle tracking, and eventually roadside assistance.\n\nTheir custom vehicle tracking system became a unique product in Zimbabwe. Developed in collaboration with Chinese manufacturers, Apex Trackers now provide features such as live tracking, remote vehicle immobilisation, driver behaviour analytics, geo-fencing, playback history, and microphone surveillance.\n\nApex Travelenforces strict client verification, including fingerprinting and ID capture, which has helped maintain a clean fleet and high customer integrity.\n\nThe car rental fleet grew to include sedans, mid-range SUVs, double cabs, fuel savers, luxury SUVs like the 300 series, and Mercedes-Benz S-Class models.\n\nInterestingly, COVID-19 became a defining period for Apex Travel. Though the travel business paused, car rental surged as companies sought vehicles for restricted local movement.\n\nMupfurutsa reallocated funds from his home construction to fleet expansion, turning a crisis into an opportunity. It was during this time that Apex Travel solidified car rental as its flagship division.\n\nIn addition to that, Mupfurutsa acquired haulage trucks from a distressed seller, further diversifying his assets. With no initial plan, he instinctively knew it was a strategic purchase and it proved fruitful.\n\nHis late father was always the first to test-drive any new vehicle and validate each major acquisition. His passing in February 2023 from cancer was a deep personal loss, but his legacy remains central to Mupfurutsas journey.\n\nMupfurutsas personal resilience was again tested when their nearly completed family home caught fire due to negligence by a caretaker.\n\nDespite the destruction, his father encouraged him to finish the project, calling it the test of time. With support from loyal contractors, some whom refused payment, he rebuilt the house.\n\nToday, Tanaka Mupfurutsa stands tall as a visionary entrepreneur, husband, father, and innovator who continues to grow Apex Travel into one of Zimbabwes most dynamic service providers across travel, logistics, and tech-enabled fleet services.\n\n",
