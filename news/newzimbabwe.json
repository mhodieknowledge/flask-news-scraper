Exposure of children to such traumatic events can have enduring psychological and emotional consequences, ZHRC said.\n\nThe human rights commission also urged law enforcement authorities to investigate the matter and bring the perpetrators to book.\n\nThe ZHRC acknowledges the swift response by thepoliceand otherstate agencies in attending to the scene and initiating investigations.\n\nIt commends these efforts and urges the authorities to pursue a timely,thoroughand impartial investigation toidentify andprosecute those responsible so that they are punished in a deterrent manner, the statement added.\n\n",

Something must have gone seriously wrong.\n\nOnias argued the property was a donation that could be revoked because Pride had become disrespectful and violent towards him, and had even tried to sell it against his wishes.\n\nBut the court ruled there was never a valid donation. There was never an intention to gratuitously and without obligation give the 1st respondent the property, Justice Muzofa said. There were strings attached. The applicant intended to continue to derive a benefit from the property.\n\nThe judge stressed that while Onias funded the purchase, the house was always registered in Prides name. The evidence before the Court strongly shows that the applicant purchased the property for the 1st respondent and he had strings attached, the judge said.\n\nDismissing the claim with costs, the judge concluded: Revocation can only be made where there is a valid donation.\n\n",

Leave me alone, said Holy Ten.\n\nOnce the fastest rising talent in Zimbabwes music industry, Holy Tens career took a nasty nose dive after he laid into popular Zim Dance Hall chanter Winky D.\n\nHis tirade against Winky D, which came after the release of a red hot collaboration,Ibotso, was blamed on unidentified drugs and alcohol, a challenge he has accepted to have been dealing with for over two years. Ibotso, which he disputed, highlighted how the high and mighty were taking all that was supposed to benefit the downtrodden.\n\nHis tweet, however, comes a day after he apologised for his online tirade, captured live on Instagram.\n\nI joined Zanu PF because I was trying to clean the reputation, the image of Zanu PF. What you did, boys, I can finish all of you off. I can end the Zanu PF today. Im bigger than the Zanu PF, he said\n\nHoly Ten has in the past posted images of himself clad in army regalia, brandishing the Zanu PF clenched fist and openly campaigned for Mnangagwa.\n\nAccording to sources closer to his circle of friends, he was gifted, by the Mnangagwa twins, a fully furnished house and numerous cars, one of which he presented to his wife, Kimberly Richards, before repossessing it to pay a debt.\n\nUnconfirmed reports from Zimbabwean socialites indicate that Richards could have been in an extramarital affair with one of Mnangagwas sons, something that could be leading to his constant meltdowns.\n\nRichards, the Mnangagwa twins, Zanu PF, government and Mnangagwa himself are yet to comment on the matter that has raised questions on abuse of CIO and military personnel for personal benefits.\n\n",
