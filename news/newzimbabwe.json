            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nERIC Niyonsaba, a Ugandan national and businessman, has demanded retraction of articles on popular site Bus Stop TV and Zim Times, both of which accused him of harbouring and financing Rwandese Intelligence Service operatives killing suspects of the 1994 genocide.\n\nNiyonsaba, who owns Fresh Kambucha Zimbabwe, gave the two publications 12 hours to act, in letters sent on May 23 by his lawyer Admire Rubaya.Failure, he said, will result in his client instituting legal proceedings, to get managers of both publications arrested and prosecuted for malicious damage to his clients image and that of his company.The letter was also copied to Police Commissioner General Stephen Mutamba.Circumstances are that the two produced a report indicating Niyonsaba as one of many Ugandan nationals running cover companies, including tuckshops, that were financing Rwandan secret service operatives in an operation targeting suspects of the world infamous 1994 genocide.The article was titled Kagame intelligence agents allegedly involved in killings of genocide suspects in Zimbabwe.The statement that you published on your website is defamatory and was understood by a reasonable reader, follower or social media user that our client is an illicit business which is a front for the Rwandan Intelligence services which houses terrorists and criminals who are killing people allegedly connected to the Rwanda 1994 genocide, said Rubaya in the letter.You have actively discouraged your followers and other social media users from purchasing the product (Fresh Kambucha), thereby potentially harming our clients reputation and business interests.He has no connection whatsoever to the Rwandan Intelligence Services or any of the individuals that you alleged he works with to fund the alleged extra judicial killings.He does not house any terrorists who are allegedly conducting the alleged extra judicial killings and that he is not involved in spying for the Rwandan Intelligence Services.Further allegations that Fresh Kambucha had not undergone rigorous tests to prove its safety, were said to have significantly affected Niyonsabas business.Added Rubaya: Our client has a traceable record of clean and well manufactured Kambucha drinks, which have been scientifically tested to the extent that no adverse report has been authored by the relevant authorities.Our client is a genuine international investor who originates from the great country of Uganda, which is led by the African son Yoweri Kaguta Museveni. He is lawfully in Zimbabwe and is just but a pure businessman who is creating employment for Zimbabweans and contributing to the national fiscus.Our clients reputation has been severely damaged and now on the verge of losing many lucrative contracts and has the real risk of being declared the enemy of the peace-loving Zimbabwean government and being called a person of interest by the Zimbabwean law enforcement agents.We enjoin you to take these allegations seriously, failing which you will only have yourselves to blame.In the event that you fail to retract the defamatory statement as demanded our client shall proceed to issue summons and claim damages for defamation as well as lodge a criminal complaint against those who run the website and/or your social media pages without any further notice to you.\n\nNiyonsaba, who owns Fresh Kambucha Zimbabwe, gave the two publications 12 hours to act, in letters sent on May 23 by his lawyer Admire Rubaya.\n\nFailure, he said, will result in his client instituting legal proceedings, to get managers of both publications arrested and prosecuted for malicious damage to his clients image and that of his company.The letter was also copied to Police Commissioner General Stephen Mutamba.Circumstances are that the two produced a report indicating Niyonsaba as one of many Ugandan nationals running cover companies, including tuckshops, that were financing Rwandan secret service operatives in an operation targeting suspects of the world infamous 1994 genocide.The article was titled Kagame intelligence agents allegedly involved in killings of genocide suspects in Zimbabwe.The statement that you published on your website is defamatory and was understood by a reasonable reader, follower or social media user that our client is an illicit business which is a front for the Rwandan Intelligence services which houses terrorists and criminals who are killing people allegedly connected to the Rwanda 1994 genocide, said Rubaya in the letter.You have actively discouraged your followers and other social media users from purchasing the product (Fresh Kambucha), thereby potentially harming our clients reputation and business interests.He has no connection whatsoever to the Rwandan Intelligence Services or any of the individuals that you alleged he works with to fund the alleged extra judicial killings.He does not house any terrorists who are allegedly conducting the alleged extra judicial killings and that he is not involved in spying for the Rwandan Intelligence Services.Further allegations that Fresh Kambucha had not undergone rigorous tests to prove its safety, were said to have significantly affected Niyonsabas business.Added Rubaya: Our client has a traceable record of clean and well manufactured Kambucha drinks, which have been scientifically tested to the extent that no adverse report has been authored by the relevant authorities.Our client is a genuine international investor who originates from the great country of Uganda, which is led by the African son Yoweri Kaguta Museveni.

attempting to fraudulently takeover his company.\n\nClark and Beverly Makoni have dismissed all allegations and maintained that witnesses being brought forward against them were using hearsay evidence.The two have now demanded appearance of Gono as a star witness, whom they say is the only one who knows what happened on the day they entered into an agreement.He is expected to make an appearance on June 13, 2025.None of the witnesses that have been presented at court has indicated any knowledge of the relationship between the complainant and defendant.The State said it will lead evidence from Investigating Officer Eric Chacha before closing its case.On Friday, the State brought in Fadzai Chiro, a former accountant at Valley Lodge, the business in question, who stated that the two parties were managing the business.She said she had never met Beverly and had only seen her in court for the first time.The State alleges that the couple forged a CR14 form in which Clark appointed himself director and company secretary and Beverly as his deputy.It is also alleged that they misrepresented to the bank that they were the new shareholders and wanted to change signatories to bank accounts.The State alleges that the couple then fraudulently took over the complainants company and gained access to its bank accounts and stole the alleged money.The witness, Chiro, said she

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nDESPITE threats of termination of contracts, University of Zimbabwe (UZ) lecturers remain defiant, cranking up pressure on government and the institution to increase, tenfold, their salaries to US$2,500 per month.\n\nThe lecturers, who have been on industrial action for a month, are pressing ahead with picketing, vowing not to return to class until government accedes to their demand for an upward review of their paltry earnings.UZ administrators responded heavy-handedly, threatening to replace the striking lecturers, with reports indicating that the adjunct tutors would be earning US$3 per hour.The Association of University Teachers (AUT) spokesperson, Obvious Vengeyi, blasted UZ for failing to attract applications for the posts.It is true that the University of Zimbabwe has hired experts to replace the real experts, who are on a lawful and constitutional strike, demanding a restoration of their salary to pre-October 2018 rates, whereby a junior lecturer got US$2,250 per month before it was slashed to only US$230, which they are currently getting.The so-called experts are hired as adjunct lecturers. That means they are not replacing the real experts. It was the university administrations hope that they would get hundreds of them so that the university would return to normal business.Unfortunately, the experiment failed spectacularly. The whole university failed to attract more than 10 across all its 11 faculties. All 10 are not qualified to teach at high school. They were pulled from the streets and from churches. It is a joke, to say the least, said Vengeyi.Last week, UZ was further plunged into chaos after the Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) staged a flash demonstration, demanding the return of lecturers.The students criticised the UZ administration for pressing ahead with examinations when they had little lecture time. The striking lecturers have disassociated themselves from overseeing examinations.Vengeyi told NewZimbabwe.com that the situation at UZ is dire and might deteriorate if the institution and the parent government arm Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education  do not address their grievances.The university is paying only US$5.50 per hour. It is not even enough for transport and lunch. The AUT, therefore, did not see any reason to interfere with their process. The situation at UZ as of today is pathetic. There are no classes taking place until we receive US$2,250. That demand must be met.If that is not met, then there is no graduation this year. Block 4 should have started on Monday, 19 May, but it failed. Nothing is happening. Remember too that Block 3 failed. This means if the situation remains the same for the next week, this semester is off, said Vengeyi.\n\nThe lecturers, who have been on industrial action for a month, are pressing ahead with picketing, vowing not to return to class until government accedes to their demand for an upward review of their paltry earnings.\n\nUZ administrators responded heavy-handedly, threatening to replace the striking lecturers, with reports indicating that the adjunct tutors would be earning US$3 per hour.The Association of University Teachers (AUT) spokesperson, Obvious Vengeyi, blasted UZ for failing to attract applications for the posts.It is true that the University of Zimbabwe has hired experts to replace the real experts, who are on a lawful and constitutional strike, demanding a restoration of their salary to pre-October 2018 rates, whereby a junior lecturer got US$2,250 per month before it was slashed to only US$230, which they are currently getting.The so-called experts are hired as adjunct lecturers.

I am asking for an apology from them because somehow I think that they think that the law works for them or belongs to them. Even I can be protected by the law. If its a crime, a magistrate is going to determine that. The law is going to determine that, said a defiant Silent Killer.\n\nHe went on to warn that he is under the protection of Prophet Walter Magaya if they dare to poke him.\n\nI read that letter and I cant say sorry that I was the one who leaked. The letter was sent to my lawyers, this is between the lawyers. Remember Im the son of Prophet Magaya, so whatever you plan on me, rains will pour, said Silent Killer.\n\nIn the letter of demand, Y2K Entertainment alleges that they incurred substantial expenses, including cost of three airfare tickets and various payments made to facilitate his travel and Visa application.\n\nWe are instructed by our client to demand, as we hereby do; that you pay the sum of USD122, 170 (One hundred and twenty-two thousand one hundred and seventy United States Dollars) which amount is now due to our client and must be paid within seven (7) days of being served with this letter.\n\nYou are also further expected to pay US$12, 217 (Twelve thousand two hundred and seventeen United States dollars) being our collection commission, reads part of the letter.\n\n",
