            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has unveiled plans to launch newly designed ZWG notes, effectively dumping the old defiled versions in a move set to trigger yet another wave of shock across the markets.\n\nIntroduced on April 5 2024, as the countrys lasting solution to currency problems, the ZWG has suffered major setbacks since its inception, including the 43% devaluation in September 2024, which left the local units gold-backed status in question.\n\nThe currency is still in short supply, with the rural economy having very limited access to the local unit despite being the most populous. Some regions have resorted to using the rand as a medium of exchange, especially for smaller denominations in transactions.\n\nIn the midst of another storm following the announcements that the country will adopt the ZWG as the sole currency in 2030, RBZ governor, Dr John Mushayavanhu, on Tuesday told a state-run publication that plans to launch a new version of ZWG notes were currently underway.\n\nThe Reserve Bank is working on the modernisation of the ZiG banknote series as advised in the recent mid-term Monetary Policy Statement. The new ZiG banknotes will be redesigned, including improved quality and durability for the convenience of the transacting public.\n\nIn this regard, the production process of the improved banknotes has progressed well and is at an advanced stage. The public will be advised of the expected roll-out at the appropriate time, he said.\n\nSceptics immediately took to social media platforms questioning the rationale behind the new designs, with many concluding it is a ploy to dump the failed first version.\n\nMarket watchers who anonymously spoke to our publication criticised the ghostly nature of RBZ announcements for creating more headaches than solutions.\n\nThey are of the view that the RBZ must accompany its policy announcements with finer details to avoid market speculation.\n\nOn his part, Mushayavanhu said the new notes must not be misconstrued as a new currency but just a normal routine in line with global best practices.\n\n",

They started dating while Swift was in the throes of her now world-famous Eras tour. At a Kansas City stop, Kelce attempted to give Swift his number on a friendship bracelet, a ubiquitous accessory on the tour. When that failed, he spoke openly about his affection for the singer on his podcast, New Heights.\n\nI was disappointed that she doesnt talk before or after her shows because she has to save her voice for the 44 songs she sings, Kelcetoldhis brother, Jason Kelce, on the podcast at the time.\n\nIf youre up onTaylor Swiftconcerts, there are friendship bracelets and I had received a bunch of them, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it.\n\nThe pair got in touch after that proclamation and began dating shortly thereafter. They in effect hard-launched their relationship in September 2023 when Swift appeared at Arrowhead Stadium to watch Kelce  and the Kansas City Chiefs   play the Chicago Bears.\n\nSince then, they have made headlines routinely. In one blockbuster instance, fans went wild after seeing Swift and Kelce kissing on the field after hisSuper Bowl LVIIIwin in 2024  Kelces third  with the Kansas City Chiefs in a victory against the San Francisco 49ers.\n\nIn front of thousands of screaming fans, Swift tweaked a song in her Eras Tour shows,  Karma, to be about Kelce: Karma is the guy in the Chiefs, coming straight home to me. She also featured him in a 2024 performance in London during the The Tortured Poets Department set of the show.\n\nThe pair also, very recently, appeared on New Heights together to announce Swifts upcoming 12th album, The Life of a Showgirl, which many (correctly!) suspected would be a precursor to an engagement.\n\nThat episode has since broken the record for the most concurrent views for a podcast on YouTube,Guinness World Records announced on Tuesday. About 1.3 million people simultaneously tuned in to the podcast episode when it first aired on YouTube on 13 August. By Tuesday, the podcast episode had 20m views on YouTube.\n\nFans of both Swift and Kelce have been waiting for an engagement announcement for virtually their entire relationship, but rumoursheated up last monthwhen photos of Kelceslock-screenmade the rounds on social media and beyond. The screen appeared to show a photo of the duo with Swift flashing an outstretched hand.\n\nThe NFL shared well wishes to the couple in a congratulationpostwhile Brittany Mahomes showed her support in an Instagram story, calling the pair two of the most genuine people.\n\nThe engagement is particularly notable for longtime Swifties, who have grown up with Swift and watched her dating journey over the years. Many of her songs have been about her past paramours, which include the likes of Joe Alwyn, Matty Healy, Tom Hiddleston, Joe Jonas, Taylor Lautner, Jake Gyllenhaal and John Mayer.\n\n",

            "content": "Botswana has declared a public health emergency, with President Duma Boko saying the national medical supply chain collapsed due to depleted government coffers and steep cuts in aid from the United States.\n\nThe announcement came on Monday after the Ministry of Health and Wellness warned earlier this month that the system was severely strained with $75m owed to private health facilities and suppliers.\n\nIt cited shortages of medicines for a range of illnesses, including hypertension, cancer, diabetes, tuberculosis, asthma, mental and sexual health, and stated that elective surgeries were postponed.\n\nThe Health Ministry also said there were shortages of dressings and sutures.\n\nThe medical supply chain, as run by central medical stores, has failed, President Boko said in a televised address on Monday. This failure has led to a severe disruption to health supplies countrywide.\n\nThe Ministry of Finance had earlier approved 250 million pula ($18.7m) in emergency funding for procurement, said Boko, adding that the military would oversee the distribution of emergency medicines, with the first shipments dispatching immediately from the capital, Gaborone, with priority given to deprived rural areas.\n\nThe current prices [for medicine] often are inflated five to 10 times. Under the current economic conditions, this scenario is not sustainable, Boko added.\n\nThe crisis is also linked to a shrinking national budget caused by the ongoing downturn in the global diamond market.\n\nBotswana, with a population of 2.5 million, is one of the worlds largest diamond producers. Its vast diamond reserves, discovered just after independence from Britain in 1966, make up about 80 percent of the countrys foreign earnings.\n\nBut sales have weakened in recent years, pushing a cash-strapped government to suspend certain ministerial purchases last month.\n\nSweeping cuts in aid from the US under President Donald Trump have further strained the economy. Before the cuts, the US funded a third of BotswanasHIV response, according to UNAIDS, and provided $12m through The Global Fund to fight malaria and tuberculosis.\n\nThe United Nations agency for children (UNICEF) said urgent action was needed to address the deepening medical crisis in the country, adding that one in five children was underweight in a western district near the Namibian border.\n\n",
