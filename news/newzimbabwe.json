Her car was given back to her, Masondo said, without elaborating why the police released a car used in committing of an alleged crime.\n\nThe victim came to the police station and stated that she doesnt want to open a criminal case and provided her reasons. Her car was given back to her.\n\nCol Mavela Masondo\n\nNkomos husband, Sandile Nkomo, had opened a case of a missing person with the police on August 2 after his wife did not return home from an all-night prayer service at a church in Newtown.\n\nSandile had told Sowetan that Nkomo was intercepted along the M2 by gun-wielding men before she reached the church. She told her family that the abductors allegedly drove with her from Gauteng to Ladysmith, KZN, and came back with her after they allegedly realised they had taken the wrong person.\n\nNkomos reappearance became a talking point on social media, with some users raising suspicion about her story.\n\nMasondo said the case of a missing person has since been closed.\n\nSowetan contacted Nkomo, who expressed frustration with how the media has been covering the story.\n\nI have noticed how you craft your articles to suit your narrative on this matter. I will be giving all that information to other media houses that will relay it the way I say it. I will not be commenting further on this matter, thanks. People would rather see a #Justice4Mbalenhle post than one where she was released untouched.\n\nNkomo, a beautician by trade, has since removed her social media accounts.\n\n",

It is expected to unlock an estimated USD 350 million in investment.\n\nThe plan is to build the solar park in two phases, starting with the installation of 500 MW of power-generating capacity. The pilot stage will supply electricity to the Intensive Energy Users Group, a consortium of large industrial and mining companies, under a 20-year take-or-pay power purchase agreement (PPA).\n\nThe agreement was signed during the 32nd Annual Meetings of Afreximbank (AAM2025). It was one of four project preparation deals inked at the event, which are collectively expected to catalyse around USD1 billion in investments.\n\n",
