            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nCONTROVERSIAL tenderpreneur Wicknell Chivayo has warned out-of-favour Bikita South legislator, Energy Mutodi, that he should enjoy his last supper in Parliament, because he will ensure he does not return in 2028.\n\nChivayo, a business tycoon and convicted criminal, jumped to the defence of Ministry of Finance Permanent Secretary George Guvamatanga, after Mutodi accused him of corruption.\n\nWicknell Chivayo\n\nLast week, Mutodi requested that Parliament summons Guvamatanga to answer to corruption charges after allegations emerged that the Treasury head was demanding kickbacks worth millions of US dollars from contractors.\n\nMutodi alleged in Parliament that contractors were unwilling to offer government services because Guvamatanga was demanding kickbacks of between five and 10 percent, threatening to withhold payments if they refused.\n\nFollowing a fierce backlash from his fellow party members, including Politburo members, Mutodi backed down and apologised for calling Guvamatanga a corrupt oligarch.\n\nHowever, this was not enough to save him from being demoted from his position as chairman of the Budget and Finance Parliamentary Portfolio Committee.\n\nMany critics, including lawyers such as Tendai Biti and David Coltart, condemned Mutodis demotion as unconstitutional and a threat to Parliaments oversight role.\n\nThe removal of Energy Mutodi as Chairman of the Budget Committee is the perfect opportunity for opposition MPs to exercise Parliamentary Privilege to speak about the allegations originally leveled by Mutodi against George Guvamatanga and by others against Kuda Tagwireyi, Coltart posted on his X (formerly Twitter) account on Thursday.\n\nColtart urged opposition MPs to rise to the occasion and defend Mutodi, saying his demotion was an attack on Parliamentary privileges. Coltart believes the opposition MPs shouldnt remain silent when such a privilege is attacked before their very eyes.\n\nThis is what parliamentary privilege is all about  it gives MPs a unique opportunity to speak on a public platform, which is recorded in Hansard and thus available to the public, on topics which other citizens cannot do without fear of defamation actions or worse.\n\nUntil now there has generally been a deafening silence from MPs . Now is the time in #Zimbabwe for them to show their mettle and prove that the electorate was justified in placing their trust in this crop of MPs, he added.\n\nIn response, Chivayo told Coltart to recruit Mutodi into their opposition Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) party, because he was no longer wanted in Zanu PF, warning that in 2028 he would make sure Mutodi does not win the Zanu PF primary elections.\n\nMutorei ku CCC kana ku Zanu hatichamudi, as an honourable member trusted with the position of chairman of a portfolio committee we dont expect you speculate or conjecture in Parliament. Kana seat rake next election we will make sure anodyiwa ku ma primary, he posted on his X account Thursday.\n\nCritics were also quick to point out that individuals like Chivayo wouldnt remain silent when their corrupt colleagues, like Guvamatanga, were under attack.\n\nOn social media, people have also suggested that Guvamatanga and Chivayo are part of the same corrupt network, and that an injury to one is an injury to all.\n\nMany also believe that Chivayo is part of a corrupt cartel that Vice President Constantino Chiwenga referred to as Zvigananda  individuals who amass wealth through corruption.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nZIMBABWEANS must follow the law and get proper documentation that allows them to stay legally in foreign countries.\n\nResponding to a request by an opposition Member in Parliament this week during a Question-and-Answer session, Parliament Speaker Jacob Mudenda said it was impossible to have medical facilities at Zimbabwe Embassies (South Africa) to cater for illegal immigrants (Zimbabweans) who are being denied access to health care in that country.\n\nCitizen Coalition for Change (CCC)s Mbizo MP Corban Madzivanyika had raised the matter over xenophobia against Zimbabweans being denied access to health services in the neighbouring country.\n\nWe have a situation here where the citizens of Zimbabwe who are living in South Africa illegally are being denied the right to seek medical assistance in case of illness.\n\nDoes Zimbabwe have plans to put hospitals maybe in our embassies for the sake of protecting or assisting these vulnerable Zimbabweans who are being abused left, right and centre in a foreign land?\n\nThe Speaker responded curtly.\n\nHow can we have such facilities for illegal people? No, they must follow the law. We have borders here who they can get proper papers to enter South Africa or any other country. So entertaining illegal people who enjoy illegalities, I do not think is the right thing.\n\nAnother legislator Lungile Ncube had earlier on asked what policy was there to protect locals in foreign land.\n\nWhat was the government policy on Zimbabwean nationals who were continuously being denied access to public hospitals and healthcare centres in South Africa?\n\nHealth and Child Care Deputy Minister Sleiman Kwidini replied saying the issue needed a holistic solution.\n\nI think the question mostly deals with Foreign Affairs because all citizens who are in a foreign land are registered there and are known for the business they are doing there.\n\nNevertheless, in humanity cases, if someone is sick in any way, there is no way one can be denied access to health because health is key to everyone, Kwidini said.\n\nThe deputy minister said the case of South Africa was one of its kind of behaviour, which was happening because of the Dudula or xenophobic attacks against foreigners.\n\nSouth Africans have alleged that foreigners were taking their resources and jobs as well.\n\nKwidini explained that most of the foreign nationals, especially from Zimbabwe were growing the South African economy by providing services.\n\nIt is an issue that needs to be looked into in a holistic approach between the governments so that no one is denied access to healthcare services, Kwidini said.\n\nWe do not have any government declaration from South Africa that they do not want Zimbabweans to go to hospitals but those are unscrupulous people seeking attention.\n\nSo, we are also encouraging Zimbabweans to go to South Africa legally. That is why we also have passport offices there so that you become well documented in the event that you get sick, you can go to the hospital legally.\n\nMeanwhile, the South African government this week extended the validity of the Zimbabwe Exemption Permit (ZEP) to thousands of Zimbabwean nationals whose permits expired to May 2027.\n\nI have decided to extend the validity of the Zimbabwe Exemption Permits (ZEP) until May 28, 2027, South African Home Affairs minister Leon Schreiber stated in a Gazette.\n\n",

He explained that Mine Entra serves as a critical platform for meaningful dialogue about the future of Zimbabwes mining sector, which remains central to the countrys economic development.Mining is the backbone of our economy, Dr. Chiwenga said, noting that the sector contributes around 14.5% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and sustains the livelihoods of thousands across the nation.The theme of this years Mine Entra, Beyond Extraction: Sustaining the Future of Mining, was described by Chiwenga as timely and forward-looking. He called for a shift from traditional raw mineral extraction to a model focused on beneficiation and exporting finished products. This, he said, will help drive job creation and sustainable economic growth.Its essential that every gramme of mineral extracted translates into jobs for our people, he stated, emphasising the need for a sustainable and inclusive mining industry.Addressing miners directly, Chiwenga urged them to act as stewards of the countrys mineral resources.You are the custodians of our mineral wealth. Handle it with integrity, and remember that these resources belong to the nation, not for personal gain, he said.He added that the governments vision is to ensure that every Zimbabwean, both today and in future generations, benefits from the countrys natural resources.\n\nIn his keynote address at the opening of the 28th Mine Entra Conference in Bulawayo Thursday, Chiwenga highlighted Zimbabwes abundant natural resources, stressing the importance of using them to foster widespread empowerment and long-term development.\n\nOur mineral wealth should not be used for individual enrichment, he stated.Instead, it should serve the collective good of all Zimbabweans, with responsible foreign partnerships that add value to our resources.Chiwenga made it clear that Zimbabwes doors are open to foreign investors, but under strict terms.To foreign investors, Zimbabwe is open for business, not for extraction, he emphasised.He said the government is seeking partnerships that focus on value addition, beneficiation, and technological advancement.
