Where must they do business? In Zimbabwe? Out of this country?  Mashatile asked on Tuesday.\n\nThey can do business, as long as Im not involved, not because they know me. Because once you say Mr Mashatile is capable of influencing, even if he is sitting in his house, its unfair. You must be able to say he went there to interfere.\n\nThe deputy president stressed that only Trade and Industry Minister Parks Tau had the authority to select the winning bidder.\n\nTau announced Sizekhaya as the winner on 28 May after a lengthy evaluation process and has since promised Parliament that any allegations of conflicts of interest will be investigated.\n\n",

            "content": "Agencies\n\nAt least 16 people have been killed in nationwide rallies against police brutality and government corruption in Kenya, according to Amnesty International and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights.\n\nAnother 400 people were injured on Wednesday, including protesters, police and journalists. The casualties included people hit by live fire and others who were wounded by rubber bullets, or were beaten, and were primarily in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi.\n\nDemonstrators had clashed with police, who hurled tear gas canisters and wielded batons. The protests mark one year since people stormed parliament at the peak of antigovernmentdemonstrations.\n\nThousands took to the streets to commemorate last years youth-led demonstrations against tax rises, during which at least 60 people were killed by security forces, according to rights groups.\n\nAmong the crowds in the capital, some waved Kenyan flags and placards with pictures of demonstrators killed last year and chanted Ruto must go, referring to President William Ruto, whose proposed tax hikes triggered last years youth-led protests.\n\nIve come here as a Kenyan youth to protest. It is our right for the sake of our fellow Kenyans who were killed last year. The police are here  they are supposed to protect us, but they kill us, Eve, a 24-year-old woman, told the AFP news agency.\n\nIt is extremely important that the young people mark June 25th because they lost people who look like them, who speak like them  who are fighting for good governance, said Angel Mbuthia, chair of the youth league for the opposition Jubilee Party.\n\nProtesters also gathered in various other parts of the country, including in the town of Matuu, approximately 100km (62 miles) from the capital, where there were reports of clashes.\n\nPolice blocked main roads leading into the capitals central business district, while government buildings were barricaded with razor wire.\n\nThe government ordered TV and radio stations to halt live coverage of the protests.\n\nNetBlocks, a global internet tracker, said social media platform Telegram had been restricted. And Kenyan broadcaster KTN was taken off the air later on Wednesday, a senior official at its parent company, Nation Media Group, said.\n\nAl Jazeeras Malcolm Webb, reporting from Nairobi, said protests across the country have been met with a lot of violence by the police.\n\nAbout a dozen people have been treated for gunshot wounds, he said, citing local media reports.\n\nKenyas Citizen TV reported that protesters torched court facilities in Kikuyu on the outskirts of Nairobi.\n\nIsolated clashes were reported in the port city of Mombasa, according to NTV, with protests also in the towns of Kitengela, Kisii, Matuu and Nyeri.\n\nThe anniversary comes amid soaring anger aboutpolice brutality, particularly after 31-year-old blogger and teacher, Albert Ojwang, was killed in custody earlier this month following his arrest for criticising a senior officer.\n\nSix people, including three police officers, were charged with murder on Tuesday for Ojwangs killing. They have all pleaded not guilty.\n\nPolice have said protests are permitted as long as they are peaceful and unarmed.\n\nBut a group of peaceful protesters was attacked last week by a large gang of motorbike-riding goons, as they are known in Kenya, armed with whips and clubs and working in tandem with the police.\n\nOn Tuesday, the embassies of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, and other Western nations released a joint statement on X urging all involved to facilitate peaceful demonstrations and to refrain from violence.\n\nThe use of plain clothed officers in unmarked vehicles erodes public trust, the statement said. Rights campaigners condemned the presence of unidentified police officers at protests last year.\n\nKenyas Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement late on Tuesday that any policing violations would be addressed through government institutions, including the parliament and the judiciary.\n\nThe ministry reminds all that diplomatic partnerships flourish best in mutual respect, open channels and a recognition of each others unique governance contexts, it said.\n\nThere is also growing resentment among young people towards Ruto, who came to power in 2022, promising rapid economic progress.\n\nMany have been disillusioned by continued stagnation, corruption and high taxes, even after last years protests forced Ruto to cancel an unpopular finance bill. His government has been at pains to avoid direct tax rises this year.\n\nBut the frequent disappearances of government critics  rights groups have counted more than 80 since last years protests, with dozens still missing  have led many to accuse Ruto of returning Kenya to the dark days of its dictatorship in the 1980s and 90s.\n\nRuto previously promised an end to abductions but was unapologetic in a speech on Tuesday, pledging to stand by the police.\n\nYou cannot use force against the police or insult, or threaten the police, he warned protesters. You are threatening our nation.\n\n",
