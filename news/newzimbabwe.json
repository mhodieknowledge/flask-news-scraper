Those found wanting will regret the day of their existence.\n\nAccording to Parliament, the generator had been activated at midday, with ZESA engineers on site to monitor proceedings.\n\nHowever, the backup system reportedly developed a technical fault approximately two and a half hours into the address, causing the blackout while Mnangagwa was still delivering his speech.\n\nA letter from Acting Clerk of Parliament Nomasonto Sunga to Local Government Permanent Secretary John Bhasera, dated October 21, had requested a serviced, fully tested and fit generator for the SONA, citing previous blackouts during important sessions.\n\nWATCH : President Emmerson Mnangagwa was on Tuesday forced to complete his State of the Nation Address (SONA) using a torchlightafter the New Parliament Building was plunged into darkness.\n\n\"The person who switched off electricity while the President was speaking will regrethttps://t.co/TqTPubyuMxpic.twitter.com/IIlyQncs8O\n\n NewZimbabwe.com (@NewZimbabweCom)October 28, 2025\n\nThis is the second time a blackout has occurred at the Parliament Building in Mnangagwas presence, following a similar incident in November 2024 during Finance Minister Mthuli Ncubes 2025 National Budget presentation.\n\nWe request your ministrys coordination and oversight in ensuring uninterrupted power supply during the State of the Nation Address (SONA), which has been tentatively scheduled for 28 October 2025 at Parliament Building.\n\nIt is noted that there is an approved arrangement to run the event using the generator as the primary source of power, with ZETDC on standby, following previous power disruptions experienced during important sessions, Sunga wrote.\n\nIn view of this, the generator must be serviced, fully tested, and confirmed fit for uninterrupted operation during the event. ZETDC technical staff should be physically on standby throughout the proceedings to provide an immediate response if required.\n\nParliament also assured that it would promptly pay the company contracted to provide generator services and supply sufficient fuel to ensure smooth power supply throughout the event.\n\nParliament will ensure timely payment to the service provider contracted for the generator service, as well as the provision of adequate fuel to power the system throughout the duration of the event, added Sunga.\n\n",

There is a correlation between what happened after midnight,the arson, the abduction of the security guard.\n\nIt was done by people who know the job of fear. They seem to have forgotten that we have endured such harassment for the past two years, said Mandaza.\n\nThe ruling party has endorsed a resolution seeking to extend Mnangagwas presidency to 2030, which would require amending Section 91(2) of the Constitution, which limits a president to two terms, and Section 328(7), which bars incumbents from benefiting from constitutional amendments.\n\nAccording to party insiders, ZANU PF intends to use its parliamentary majority to push through the proposed changes.\n\nSpeaking at the disrupted event, Biti condemned the attacks and reaffirmed the groups commitment to defending the Constitution.\n\nWe are very sorry to Dr. Mandaza over the arson, and to Gilbert Mbwende, whose house was also attacked.\n\nThis is a new initiative by concerned citizens to resist the mutilation of the Constitution. It is not a political effort, but a civic one, to defend the rule of law, Biti said.\n\n",

This cowardly act must be condemned in the strongest terms possible. How can we live in a country that fears words? Mpofu wrote on his X account on Tuesday morning.\n\nWriting on his X account on Tuesday morning, self-exiled former Cabinet Minister, Saviour Kasukuwere, said the bombing of SAPES Trust is a shameful act.\n\nThis is shameful. A leopard cannot change its spots! We have to choose hope over fear.\n\nAlthough Mnangagwa styles himself as a constitutionalist and has declined to plan for running beyond 2028, he has done little to stop those who are canvassing support for him to continue in power until 2030.\n\nThe calls for Mnangagwa to continue beyond 2028 have caused fissures within his ruling party, Zanu PF.\n\nAnalysts have warned that the succession battle in Zanu PF could cause chaos and violence in the country, as they believe that the calls for Mnangagwa to go beyond 2028 are purely a strategy to frustrate his deputy, Rtd Constantino Chiwenga, who is widely expected to take over.\n\n",
