            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nINDUSTRY and Commerce Minister, Mangaliso Ndlovu has shot down sceptics underscoring that the countrys business community must never underestimate the huge benefits they are set to derive from a de-dollarised economy.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has since tabled indications to go full scale de-dollarisation plans on the back of considerations on finding the best way forward to trim the costs of exports in a dollarised economy.\n\nThe announcement has since drawn mixed reactions from industry with players in sectors such as property already demanding a clear framework on how the measures will be implemented.\n\nAgainst the background, the Bretton Woods Institution, International Monetary Fund, recently added its voice on the matter by calling on the authorities to clarify the plans.\n\nSpeaking to NewZimbabwe.com on the sidelines of a media tour organised by the Transport and Infrastructure Development Ministry in Plumtree Friday, Ndlovu shot down the fears being expressed by sceptics, insisting that the plans will benefit industry.\n\nThey are justified to be sceptical because of where we are coming from. But talk to them today. Talk to the business people today.They will tell you that for the first time theyve kept the ZWG for no less than three months because theyve seen its stability. We have a responsibility as a government to stabilise the ZWG, he said.\n\nHe said once it is stable, those concerns will go as he insisted that business will never be competitive as long as the economy remains stuck with the US dollar.\n\nSo, when we talk about this gradual move, we have them in mind. Its not a reckless move. We know that Zimbabwe has a small population of 16 million which is too small. There is a whole 400 million in SADC (Southern African Development Community), there is COMESA (Common Markets for Eastern nd Southern Africa), there is African Continental Free Trade Area with 1.3 billion people. For us to be able to target those, we have to use our own currency. Thats what we are targeting, he said.\n\nNdlovu added that the migration will be undertaken with due considerations and safeguards as he insisted the country cannot do away with de-dollarisation.\n\n",

The funds amounting to over US$250,000 were later withdrawn and converted into cryptocurrency.The court also heard that the accused later roped in another man, only identified as Billy, to help process the illicit transactions, while EcoCash agent Blessing Julias handled some of the withdrawals.During her testimony, Madam Boss told the court that Mushambi was the one who introduced her to the E-Creator scheme.I can recall that sometime in June 2023, I was informed by Mushambi that the accused (Jiatong and Chui) wanted me to market their company, which they said was an investment platform, she said.She told the court that she and her manager, Fanwell Masunugure, met the accused at their Joina City offices.They told us they wanted us to advertise their company and invite Zimbabweans to invest through the supplied link for profit. I then advertised their company on my Facebook page together with Mushambi the same day I met them.
