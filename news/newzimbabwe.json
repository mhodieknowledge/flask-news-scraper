Muwodzeri said.The MPs call comes after this weeks mysterious murder of prominent businessman Joseph Mutangaz Mutangadura (67) who was gunned down at his Lisheen Estate in Ruwa late last Sunday.Joseph Mutangaz MutangaduraActing leader of government business in Parliament Anxious Masuka said guns have to be registered.Guns have to be licenced. I know the ministry has requested that more punitive measures be meted on those found to be in possession of illegal firearms, and not just in possession, but it is also worrisome to hear that those firearms are used to commit robberies and some of those culminating in murders, Masuka said.However, Masuka highlighted to Speaker Jacob Mudenda that because of the gravity of the matter, licenced or unlicenced guns can be used for robberies and to commit murder, hence a research on the veracity of the issue should be done.Referring to the question by Muwodzeri, the minister responded: This is a very worrisome development. If it is unlicenced, it is illegal.The law must take its course and the full wrath of the law must visit those that use unlicenced firearms and carry unlicenced firearms.To own the citizenry, we must follow the proper channels of acquiring firearms and be able to adhere to the conditions that are associated with the issuance of such firearms, said MasukaZanu PF MP for Mberengwa West, Tafanana Zhou asked what could be done to ensure that the firearms licences were not easily acquired by foreigners, who get licences easily, abusing those firearms?Masuka promised to inquire from the Home Affairs ministry so that they analyse the laws and see how they can be strengthened to ensure proper vetting may be done for anyone who needs a firearms licence.Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) Kuwadzana East MP Charlton Hwende alleged that most of the people using unlicenced firearms were in the army and the police.What is government policy to ensure that government pays soldiers and the police enough salaries so that they do not abuse firearms and abuse them for robbery?The Speaker ordered Hwende to bring up the matter in a written form as statistics were needed to indicate how many of the security forces were found in possession of firearms after robbery or shootings.Opposition legislator Edwin Mushoriwa for Dzivaresekwa constituency requested to know if government had plans to amend the Firearms Act [Chapter 10: 09] which was enacted a very long time ago.Is there any attempt to amend that Act, given that most of the guns, some of them are inherited guns that have not been properly changed, Mushoriwa said.Dangamvura-Chikanga MP Prosper Mutseyami chipped in querying if there were measures being taken by the government to ensure that firearms do not cross into Zimbabwe illegally.The policy is to ensure that borders are well secured.

It will be decentralised in all our central hospitals, as you are aware that all our central hospitals have specialists who can perform these surgeries.\n\nWhat is now hindering them is the modern equipment to use for that, but definitely with time, we are going to make sure that it is going to be done to our locals and to our people for free, said Kwidi.\n\nThe lack of medical equipment in major public hospitals has left many citizens to seek treatment outside the country.\n\nHowever, the poor who cannot afford specialised treatment in foreign countries and private medical facilities have to contend with the dire services in public hospitals.\n\nKwidini made a bold assertion that the government is addressing the countrys healthcare systems.\n\nWith that, as per our policy, we want to make sure that these trained specialist doctors locally are going to be capacitated, especially with the tools of trade.\n\nThat is why we have seen now that our President has moved to the mantra to say, let us renovate our health institutions into the modern systems to ensure that we are able to do the specialised treatment which people are seeking on these major operations, especially in India and other countries, said Kwidini.\n\n",

Therefore, we are looking forward to having more doctors in 2029 to 2030 to service these rural hospitals, said Kwidini.\n\nThis has left citizens in rural areas in a quandary, forcing them to walk long distances to access medical services.\n\nKwidini said this is a result of a lack of accommodation facilities at some rural clinics.\n\nIt is true that we need doctors in rural hospitals so that elderly people do not have to travel long distances to see doctors. We have a challenge with the doctors houses in district hospitals. This is the challenge that we are facing, which then results in elderly people failing to find those doctors in rural hospitals.\n\nThere is no accommodation for these doctors, but as soon as we put in place accommodation, they will be found nearer to them. For us to put doctors in clinics, it is difficult because the patient ratio is not enough, he said.\n\nThe countrys health system is in dire straits, leaving the majority to rely on private facilities, with the poor left to contend with the public hospitals.\n\nPresident Emmerson Mnangagwa has pledged to address the situation at public hospitals, with a section of Parirenyatwa Hospital undergoing renovations.\n\n",

            "content": "The Guardian\n\nThe number of asylum seekers being housed in hotels has risen by 8% to 32,059 in a year, according toHome Officedata.\n\nThe data also shows that the government is processing asylum applications much more quickly, with 71,000 cases awaiting approval, relating to 91,000 people, compared with 134,000 two years ago.\n\nThe figures come amidgrowing clamour from councilsto block hotels being used to house asylum seekers through legal action, after a court ruled that more than 100applicants staying in Essex should be removed.\n\nThe high court judgment has led to ministers bracing for further legal challenges from across the country and pressure on the government to find other places to house people.\n\nThe latest Home Office figures, published on Thursday as part of the usual quarterly immigration statistics, cover Labours first year in office.\n\nThere were 32,059 asylum seekers in UK hotels by the end of June, up from 29,585 at the same point a year earlier, when the Conservatives were still in power, but down slightly on the 32,345 figure at the end of March.\n\nThe latest number is still below the peak of 56,042 asylum seekers in hotels at the end of September 2023 under the Tories.\n\nFor the first time in four years, the asylum applications backlog has fallen below 100,000 people. It is now just over 70,000 cases, relating to almost 91,000 people  down by 18% from a year earlier and its lowest since September 2021.\n\nIn the year ending June 2025, the Home Office forcibly removed 9,100 people  up a quarter on the previous year. More than half were foreign national offenders who were being deported at the end of sentences.\n\nEnver Solomon, the chief executive of the Refugee Council, said: Bringing the asylum system back from the brink of collapse is a genuine achievement in the governments first year. The increase in asylum decisions means refugees can begin to rebuild their lives sooner, and the use of costly hotels can be ended faster.\n\nYvette Cooper, the home secretary, said: The action we have taken in the last 12 months  increasing returns of failed asylum seekers by over 30%, cutting asylum costs by 11%, reducing the backlog by 18% and our forthcoming plans to overhaul the failing asylum appeal system  are crucial steps to restoring order, and putting an end to the chaotic use of asylum hotels that we inherited from the previous government.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Conservative-run authority in Epping Forest won a temporary high court injunction to remove people from the Bell hotel.\n\nAbout 140 asylum seekers must leave the hotel by 12 September after the high court imposed a temporary injunction against them staying there.\n\nThe Labour-run Wirral and Tamworth councils are among more than 10 that are reportedly considering legal challenges to close hotels housing asylum seekers in their area.\n\nOn Tuesday, Chris Philp, the shadow home secretary, named three Conservative councils that were considering legal action in efforts to shut down asylum hotels in their areas.\n\nAsked how many Tory councils were considering legal action, he told BBC Breakfast: There are certainly a number who are actively considering it. Broxbourne, which is next door to Epping, is one of them. I think Reigate and Banstead is another, Hillingdon is yet a third.\n\nSo, I think there are many up and down the country who are looking at this following the Epping ruling.\n\nWhitehall sources said the government was expected to appeal against the Epping ruling.\n\nCharles Falconer, a Labour peer who served as justice secretary under Tony Blair and was previously Starmers shadow attorney general, urged ministers to appeal.\n\nHe told the BBC Radio 4 Today programme the judgment causes great problems because it gives rise to the expectation that some asylum hotels can be closed but without indicating which ones.\n\nI very strongly urge the government  I dont know what theyre going to do  to appeal and get some certainty, first of all on which should be closed  and which shouldnt, secondly to deal with the question of a reasonable timescale in relation to this, and thirdly to deal with this very troublesome issue: namely, do demonstrations outside these hostels lead it to it being more likely that they will be closed, he said.\n\nThe Democratic Unionist party (DUP) is also seeking to remove asylum seekers from hotels in Northern Ireland after the landmark ruling in England.\n\nAntrim & Newtownabbey borough council has launched an enforcement investigation into the use of the Chimney Corner in Mallusk to house asylum seekers after a complaint by the DUP Stormont assembly member Trevor Clarke.\n\nThe party  the second-biggest in Northern Ireland  would also lodge complaints about the other two hotels that house asylum seekers in two other council areas, Clarke said.\n\nWednesdayshigh court rulingthat the Bell hotel in Essex cannot be used to house asylum seekers because of a breach of planning rules paved the way for similar legal challenges, Clarke said.\n\nHousing asylum seekers in hotels without first securing a change of use through the proper planning process (from hotel to hostel or immigration centre accommodation) constitutes a breach of planning regulations. No one is above the law, not even government departments. If the Home Office or its contractors wish to place large numbers of illegal immigrants into our communities, they must follow the same planning rules as everyone else.\n\nThe other hotels that house asylum seekers in Northern Ireland were in the Causeway Coast and Glens and the Ards and North Down council areas, theIrish News reported.\n\nHome Office spending on asylum in the UK stood at 4.76bn in 2024-25, down 12% from a record 5.38bn in 2023-24, government figures show. The total covers all Home Office costs related to asylum, including direct cash support and accommodation, plus wider staffing and other migration and borders activity.\n\nAsylum seekers and their families can be housed in temporary accommodation, known as contingency accommodation, if they are awaiting assessment of their claim or have had a claim approved and there is not enough longer-term accommodation available.\n\nWhen there is not enough housing, the Home Office, which has a legal obligation to provide accommodation to asylum seekers who would otherwise be destitute, can move people to alternatives such as hotels and large sites, such as former military bases.\n\n",
