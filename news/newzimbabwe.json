            "content": "By Kitsepile Nyathi, The East African\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has indicated that Zimbabwes external debt is understated by over $2 billion, a development that casts doubt on the countrys suitability for debt relief.\n\nZimbabwe, burdened with $21 billion debt, according to official figures, has been pushing for an urgent resolution with major Western creditors since the removal of long-time ruler Robert Mugabe in a military coup eight years ago, but without success.\n\nAccording to the IMFs newly released 2025 Article IV Consultation Report, Zimbabwes debt stood at a staggering $23.3 billion at the end of 2024, exposing a major discrepancy with the countrys acknowledged debt figures.\n\nThe Bretton Woods institutions findings echoed earlier observations by the African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank), which stated in its May country brief that Zimbabwes external debt was much higher than official estimates.\n\nZimbabwe has been accumulating arrears to external creditors for over two decades due to its failure to repay loans.\n\nTotal public and publicly guaranteed debt stood at $23.3 billion (72.9 percent of Gross Domestic Product) at the end of 2024, the IMF report reads.\n\nThe external debt stock was $16.7 billion (52.5 percent of GDP). Zimbabwe has been accumulating external arrears to its official creditors since the early 2000s, estimated at $7.4 billion (23.2 percent of GDP).\n\nMore recently, the government has started accumulating arrears to external commercial creditors, estimated at $47.4 million at the end of 2024 (0.1 percent of GDP), and has suspended servicing some of its domestic debt obligations, amounting to $425 million (0.8 percent of GDP) in 2025.\n\nThe IMF said the governments economic policies did not appear sufficient to extricate the country from the debt crisis.\n\nCurrent policies are insufficient to restore debt sustainability, which will require a balanced mix of fiscal consolidation, strengthened public debt management, growth-promoting structural reforms, and external arrears resolution-paving the way for new financing from multilateral and bilateral creditors, the report added.\n\nLoan defaults\n\nZimbabwe began defaulting on loan repayments to the World Bank, the IMF, and other lenders in 2000 under the regime of the late Robert Mugabe. The defaults escalated during the height of a controversial land reform programme that began around the same time, leading to the countrys international isolation and economic ruin.\n\nThe countrys biggest Paris Club creditors are Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the United States, with a combined external debt stock amounting to $2.9 billion-accounting for 74 percent of the total Paris Club external debt.\n\nSince 2019, Zimbabwe has been using the Structured Dialogue Platform (SDP), championed by then African Development Bank (AfDB) president Akinwumi Adesina and former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano, to push for a debt clearance programme.\n\nThe IMF said the SDP provided a framework for engagement on three pillars: economic reforms, political-governance reforms, and farmers compensation and land tenure reforms.\n\nIt noted that while progress had been made on some sub-components, bilateral Paris Club creditors insisted that re-engagement required advances on all three pillars.\n\nA roadmap to clearing arrears to the international financial institutions including the World Bank, African Development Bank, and European Investment Bank-will be essential to facilitate an eventual debt resolution. But this would likely require support through a bridge loan, the IMF added.\n\nWhile discussions on a potential bridge loan are ongoing, creditors have called for an IMF Staff Monitoring Programme (SMP) to be in place before engaging on such financing.\n\nEarlier this year, Zimbabwe indicated that it was seeking debt relief and bridge financing of $2.6 billion through the SDPs Arrears Clearance and Debt Resolution Process.\n\nStaff indicated that the authorities programme that could be supported by an SMP would need to be broadly aligned with Article IV and recent capacity development advice, the IMF said.\n\nThe authorities have also initiated discussions with key commercial creditors on debt payment moratoria.\n\nIn July, World Bank president Ajay Banga warned that if Zimbabwe tried to go it alone, it would remain in a debt trap for the next five years.\n\nSouth Africa, which held the G20 presidency at the time, said Zimbabwe had sought support for its debt to be revamped under the G20s Common Framework. Such support could restore the countrys access to international markets for the first time in more than 20 years.\n\nThe Common Framework was created in 2020 to help poor countries bring together a diverse set of creditors to restructure debts.\n\nIt is not clear whether Zimbabwe would be eligible for treatment under the G20 Common Framework or the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, due to ineligibility from protracted arrears to multilateral creditors, and in HIPCs case, because Zimbabwes income exceeds the required IDA eligibility criteria, the IMF said.\n\nHowever, as shown in other cases such as Sri Lanka and Suriname, official creditors may be willing to provide an ad hoc treatment consistent with restoring debt sustainability.\n\nThe IMF noted that Zimbabwean authorities broadly agree with the unsustainable debt assessment and reiterated their commitment to the re-engagement process.\n\nIn this context, they highlighted recent progress under the SDP, where an initial payment to farmers covered by bilateral investment agreements was welcomed by partners, the report said.\n\nThe authorities also plan to launch a fourth SDP pillar focused on debt resolution, bringing creditors together to provide updates on the governments roadmap to restoring debt sustainability.\n\nThey emphasised the urgency of the process, as financing options have narrowed due to constrained access to concessional financing from official sector creditors, limited access to non-concessional commercial lenders, and challenges in the domestic capital market.\n\nZimbabwes debt stock has risen in recent years because it resorted to seeking cheap infrastructure loans from China. However, it has not been able to repay the money due to an ongoing economic crisis characterised by hyperinflation and instability.\n\nThe country has also been mortgaging its mineral resources, such as platinum, in exchange for financial support from China. Experts warn that this route is unviable and will leave the southern African nation in a serious debt trap.\n\nThis article was originally published inThe East African.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has thrown out an application by the Upper Crowhill Residents Association seeking to invalidate Mount Breezes Borrowdale Brooke Estates gated community status and to reclaim access to a contested road cutting through the estate.\n\nJustice Joel Mambara ruled that the application was fatally defective and an abuse of court process, finding that the residents association had no locus standi to approach this Court and had acted with dirty hands by continuing to occupy stands and use an illegal road without compliance certificates.\n\nThe applicants illegal actions are not merely incidental to its claim  they are central to it, Mambara said in a damning judgment. One cannot build an unlawful road through someone elses land and then ask a court to declare that road to be lawful.\n\nAt the heart of the dispute was Crowhill Road, a route Crowhill residents claimed had historically provided them access to Borrowdale Road.\n\nThe City of Harare, however, in 2015 issued a letter stating it had no objection to Mount Breezes establishing a gated community, paving the way for the installation of gates that effectively blocked Crowhill residents from using the road.\n\nThe residents argued that the Citys decision was unlawful and that the servitudes establishing the road had been extinguished when the area was subdivided in 1999. But the court dismissed their claim, stressing that the association was improperly constituted, came into existence only in 2024, and was trying to reopen issues already settled by earlier rulings.\n\nA child born in 2024 cannot retrospectively challenge decisions that its parents made in 2015, the judge said, echoing the respondents argument.\n\nMambara also condemned the association for ignoring a binding 2014 consent order that gave Crowhill Farm (Pvt) Ltd exclusive authority to represent residents in legal matters until the development is fully regularised.\n\nThe court further held that the application was in substance a review of administrative action, disguised as a declaratory application, and was therefore grossly out of time since it sought to overturn a City of Harare decision made nine years ago.\n\nDismissing the application with punitive costs, the judge warned: The courts cannot connive at or condone the applicants open defiance of the law. Citizens are obliged to obey the law of the land and argue afterwards.\n\nThe ruling cements earlier judgments affirming Mount Breezes residents right to enjoy their gated community free from trespass and effectively ends Crowhill residents long-running bid to force open access through the estate.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFormer Finance Minister Tendai Biti has condemned the removal of Energy Mutodi from his position as Chair of the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Budget and Finance, following the Bikita South legislators demand that Parliament summon Finance Ministry Permanent Secretary George Guvamatanga to answer bribery allegations involving millions of dollars.\n\nMutodi had taken to X to allege that Guvamatanga was demanding kickbacks from contractors undertaking government work across various sectors. He further claimed that contractors had lost interest in working with the government because Guvamatanga was allegedly demanding millions of dollars as bribes at every turn, threatening to withhold their payments if his demands were not met.\n\nHis allegations sparked debate on social media, with some Zanu PF colleagues criticising him for rocking the boat and causing divisions within the party. Consequently, he was removed from his post as Chair of the Budget and Finance Parliamentary Committee and replaced by Chipinge East MP Lincoln Dhliwayo  a move Biti has branded as unconstitutional.\n\nWananchi, The abrupt removal of Honourable @energymutodi as chair of parliament Budget & Finance Committee is an abject unconstitutional overreach by a desperate canterkarous cartel that has captured the State and will do everything legally & extra-legally to perpetuate its vice-like grip on the public coffers of this country, Biti wrote on his X account on Monday.\n\nBiti emphasised that Parliamentarians have a constitutional duty to hold the executive to account and must be allowed to do so without facing punishment.\n\nMembers of Parliament have a constitutional obligation to hold the Executive & every other institution to account in terms of section 119 of the Constitution.\n\nFurther Members of Parliament have absolute privilege, and an unfettered right to feeedom of expression when they stand and debate in the chambers of the August House. Honorable Mutodi enjoys this constitutional protection.\n\nHe has an obligation to raise a matter of great national interest, Biti said.\n\nHe further argued that Mutodi should not be made a scapegoat for speaking out on matters that were already in the public domain, noting that Guvamatangas alleged corrupt conduct was documented in the 2024 Auditor Generals Report.\n\nThe issue of George Tongesai Guvamatanga and the alleged bribes he is demanding is a matter in the public domain and requires parliamentary scrutiny.\n\nThe issue of direct payments being made directly by Treasury to suppliers oblivious of line Ministries, Departments and Agencies has been captured in the Auditor Generals Reports.\n\nBiti also alleged that Guvamatanga had facilitated over US$2 billion in payments to service providers in contravention of the Public Finance Management Act.\n\nIn 2024 alone US$2 billion of payments were made directly by Mr Guvamatanga in his role and capacity as the Paymaster General.\n\nYet Treasury Instructions, which he supervises, the Public Finance Management Act and the Constitution clearly proscribe the same, he said.\n\nBiti suggested that Mutodi should not have retracted his statement against Guvamatanga.\n\nIn other words, Hon Mutodi did not disclose anything new. Everything he uttered in parliament was a matter of direct and implicit public knowledge. His mistake was his purported retraction and apology. Understandably, as a loyal member of Zanu PF, it would be expecting too much from the same. A mosquito cannot cure malaria, Biti said.\n\nBe that as it may, Honourable Mutodis removal is a direct attack on the constitution, which gives autonomy to the institution of Parliament. It is a direct attack on Parliament itself.\n\n",
