            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA Harare pastor has been spared from serving a 20-year jail term after the High Court quashed his conviction and sentence, having found that the lower court erred in finding him guilty.\n\nJeane Pierre Dusabe was jailed by a Harare magistrate for allegedly raping and indecently assaulting a minor girl he took custody of after her parents divorced back in 2014.\n\nThe rape only emerged ten years later, when the girl got married, with a formal report being made later in 2023.\n\nThe court heard, Dusabe was aged 39 while the girl was aged 12 years when the offence was allegedly committed.\n\nThe allegations in count one were that the appellant indecently assaulted the complainant once at a house in Harare.\n\nOn the second count, it was alleged that on dates unknown to the prosecutor between the years 2014 and 2022 and at different places in Harare and Masvingo, the appellant hadsexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent on several occasions.\n\nDusabe was charged with one count of rape and another of indecent assault.\n\nThe complainantstestimony was that sometime in 2014 Dusabe touched her private parts when her aunt was away on a trip to South Africa.\n\nShe was having swimming lessons conducted by Dusabe in a pool at her home in Mandara, together with her sister, who was also a minor.\n\nOn the same day, around midnight, the appellant came into the room, got into the blankets, and got on top of her.\n\nShe awoke to find the appellant on top of her before he raped her while covering her mouth.\n\nShe said after this incident, the appellant had sexual intercourse with her without her consent several times at different homes they stayed in.\n\nShe also said sometime in 2015 on unknown dates and in Hateld, the appellant would occasionally transport her to and from school using his commuter omnibus. It is alleged that during these times, the appellant would take advantage of the complainant and have sexual intercourse with her without her consent at a bushy area in Arlington.\n\nThe complainant also told the court a quo that sometime in March 2022, on an unknown date, she fell sick and sought the appellants help.\n\nShe said Dusabe suggested to her that they go to Masvingo to a doctor whom he knew who could treat her.\n\nWhilst there, Dusabe had sexual intercourse with her four times without her consent, after his relatives, whom they had found at his house, had left for Harare.\n\nThe alleged rape only surfaced after her husband confronted her over her virginity when they got married.\n\nShe told her that Dusabe had raped her several times.\n\nThe husband then told church members in 2022 but a formal report was made two years later.\n\nThe trial court found Dusabe guilty of rape and indecent assault before sentencing him to 20 years imprisonment.\n\nAggrieved, he mounted the present application, complaining that the lower court erred in convicting him when there was no evidence linking him to the alleged crimes.\n\nDusabe proved that his wife never visited South Africa in 2014 by producing her passport.\n\nThree relatives testified that Dusabe never resided at a house with a functional swimming pool.\n\nHis lawyer said the lower court was wrong in finding that the delay in reporting the rape was reasonable when one considers the manner in which the offence surfaced and material discrepancies in the evidence of the complainant.\n\nHe also said the alleged rape in Masvingo took place when the complainant was already married and that she failed to disclose it, then was therefore unreasonable.\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Christopher Dube Banda upheld Dusabes appeal, ruling that the report of rape does not meet the requirements for admissibility.\n\nThe trial court erred in failing to make findings on material aspects of the case.\n\nThe delay in reporting the alleged rape and indecent assault and the circumstances under which the disclosure was made render the complaint doubtful and unreasonable.\n\nConsequently, the State evidence led is not reliable and safe to convict on.\n\nThe appellants story is convincing.\n\nThe State failed to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe evidence that was placed before the court did not meet the required threshold when regard is had to the evidence of the State witnesses.\n\nOn that basis, this court is obliged to interfere with the findings of the trial court.\n\nThe evidence being unreliable, it was unsafe to convict the appellant on its basis.\n\nAccordingly, the court finds that the States concession was properly made. The appeal succeeds. As a result, it is ordered that the appeal against both conviction and sentence is upheld.\n\nThe court a quos conviction and sentence be and is hereby set aside and in its place is substituted the following; The accused is found not guilty and acquitted, the judge ruled.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nMalcolm-Jamal Warner, an actor best known for his role as Theo Huxtable on The Cosby Show, has died.\n\nWarner, who was 54, drowned at the weekend while on holiday in Costa Rica, local authorities said.\n\nWarner appears to have been dragged out to sea by a swift ocean current while swimming at Playa Grande around 14:00 (20:00 GMT) local time on Sunday in Cocles, a town in the province of Limn, Costa Ricas Judicial Investigation Agency said.\n\nWarner played the son of Bill Cosby on the hugely popular US sitcom from 1984-1992. Tributes swiftly poured in from celebrities, including Questlove, Jennifer Hudson, Taraji P Henson, Jennifer Love Hewitt and Magic Johnson.\n\nAuthorities said bystanders rescued Warner and brought him to shore, where the Costa Rican Red Cross tried to treat him, but he was declared dead at the scene.\n\nHe is survived by his wife and daughter.\n\nWarner was Emmy-nominated in the Outstanding Supporting Actor in a comedy series for his work on The Cosby Show in 1986.\n\nHe was handpicked for his breakout role by Cosby on the final day of a nationwide audition.\n\nI was literally the last person they saw, he recalled in a 2023 interview.\n\nThe Cosby Show ranked as the number one TV show for five seasons from 1985-90. It portrayed a cosy middle-class family  a relatively rare depiction at the time of black Americans on television.\n\nWhen the show first came out, there were white people and black people talking about [how] the Huxtables dont really exist, black people dont really live like that, Warner said in a 2013 interview.\n\nMeanwhile, we were getting tens of thousands of fan letters from people saying, Thank you so much for this show.'\n\nAfter The Cosby Show, Warner appeared in several other television programmes including Malcom & Eddie, alongside comedian Eddie Griffin.\n\nGriffin paid respects to him on social media after his death, writing R.I.P. King and My big little brother.\n\nWarner had guest appearances on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air and Sesame Street. More recently, he played AJ Austin, a cardio-thoracic surgeon on the medical drama series The Resident.\n\nWarner also won a Grammy for Best Traditional R&B Performance in 2015, alongside Robert Glasper and Lalah Hathaway for their cover of Stevie Wonders song Jesus Children of America.\n\nHis spoken word album Hiding In Plain View garnered him another Grammy nomination in 2023.\n\nLast year, he started a podcast  Not All Hood  which discussed mental health in the black community.\n\nFormer co-stars and fans has been posting their tributes to him online.\n\nBasketball star Magic Johnson, who appeared in an AIDS awareness video directed by Warner, wrote that he and his wife were both super fans of the hit Cosby Show and continued to follow his career over the years.\n\nEvery time I ran into Malcolm, we would have deep and fun conversations about basketball, life, and business. He will truly be missed, Johnson wrote.\n\nActress Jennifer Love Hewitt called him a gentleman and an incredible talent.\n\nActress Vivica A Fox posted that she was stunned and saddened by his sudden death, writing: Thanks for ya gifts, king.\n\nTracee Ellis Ross, who starred with Warner on Reed Between the Lines, also mourned him, writing: My heart is so so sad.\n\nWhat an actor and friend you were: warm, gentle, present, kind, thoughtful, deep, funny, elegant. You made the world a brighter place.\n\nSending so much love to your family. Im so sorry for this unimaginable loss.\n\nActress Taraji P Henson posted: Malcolm, we grew up with you. Thank you for the art, the wisdom, the grace you gave us!!!!!\n\nYou left the world better than you found it. Rest easy, king!!!! Your legacy lives far beyond the screen.\n\nActress Niecy Nash posted that she had recently spoken to Warner.\n\nWe talked about how happy we both were in our marriages. Damn friend. You were cornerstone of The Cosby Show.\n\nWe all loved Theo! Never to be forgotten. You will be missed. Rest Easy.\n\nGeorgia Senator Raphael Warnock also praised Warner, writing in a post: For me and so many in my generation, Malcolm-Jamal Warner was a part of our childhood, a brother whose character Theo felt like one of my own.\n\nMay God grant peace to his soul, strength and grace to his grieving family.\n\n",
