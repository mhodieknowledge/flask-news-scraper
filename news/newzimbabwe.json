            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE African Sovereign Investors Forum (ASIF) has officially endorsed the Mutapa Investment Fund (MIF) as its newest member.This recognition marks a significant milestone for the Zimbabwean sovereign wealth fund, formerly known as the Sovereign Wealth Fund of Zimbabwe, which was rebranded following the re-election of President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa in 2023.MIF, led by chief executive officer John Mangudya, is a state-owned investment fund established under Zimbabwes Sovereign Wealth Fund Act (Chapter 22:20). It is primarily funded through a mix of fiscal surpluses, resource earnings, privatisation proceeds, and official foreign currency operations. The fund was renamed via Statutory Instrument 156 of 2023 in line with the countrys broader economic objectives.The recent endorsement by ASIF signals a step forward in enhancing MIFs ability to engage with strategic partners across the continent. The announcement came during ASIFs 2025 meeting, where the organisation welcomed new members, including Ghanas Petroleum Fund. The new additions bring ASIFs total membership to 17 sovereign wealth funds from across Africa.A key highlight from the meeting was the creation of three working groups focused on agricultural development, climate finance, and data infrastructure. These groups are expected to collaborate on impactful projects that align with ASIFs broader mission of supporting Africas sustainable development and wealth transfer to future generations.The ASIF Council will reconvene later in 2025 to review progress and discuss future investment strategies.Launched in June 2022, ASIF started with 10 founding members and has since grown to include 15 sovereign wealth funds. Its aim is to foster cross-border collaboration between African nations to pool resources and expertise, driving larger and more impactful investments for the continents growth.This development highlights a growing trend of African sovereign wealth funds working together to accelerate the continents economic progress, with MIF now joining an influential network of investors.\n\nTHE African Sovereign Investors Forum (ASIF) has officially endorsed the Mutapa Investment Fund (MIF) as its newest member.\n\nThis recognition marks a significant milestone for the Zimbabwean sovereign wealth fund, formerly known as the Sovereign Wealth Fund of Zimbabwe, which was rebranded following the re-election of President Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa in 2023.MIF, led by chief executive officer John Mangudya, is a state-owned investment fund established under Zimbabwes Sovereign Wealth Fund Act (Chapter 22:20).

this year on allegations of stealing sugarcane.\n\nThe three security guards are Makina Ngwenya, Benjamin Dube and Munorwei Gomondera.In a viral video on social media earlier this year, the children were filmed lying down on their bellies while one of the guards flogged them.Parents and guardians of the school children, who are aged between 13 and 17 years, through the Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights (ZLHR), filed summons at Chipinge Magistrates Court Friday against the three security guards and their employer for unlawful assault and ill-treatment.According to the childrens lawyers, Peggy Tavagadza and Tatenda Sigauke, the minors sustained serious injuries from the beatings.The children sustained injuries from the assault and experienced swollen backsides and were not able to walk properly for some time.They experienced shock, pain and suffering both physical and psychological, emotional trauma and distress, contumelia and suffered public humiliation while their dignity and bodily integrity was violated.The assault was grievous and psychologically traumatising due to the students young ages and the viral effect of the videos, which circulated on online platforms, the lawyers said.Sigauke and Tavagadza also want the court to order Ngwenya, Dube, Gomondera and Green Fuel to pay a total of US$110 000, which entails payment of US$10 000 to each student, for damages for pain and suffering, shock, trauma, contumelia and violation of dignity.The human rights lawyers are also demanding that Green Fuel publicly apologizes to the learners, their families, and the Chisumbanje community, condemn the guards actions, and commit to preventing similar abuses in future.The legal team also wants Green Fuels apology published in a local Manicaland newspaper, aired daily on Vemuganga Community Radio for five days, and displayed on the companys social media and notice boards for 14 days.\n\nThe three security guards are Makina Ngwenya, Benjamin Dube and Munorwei

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nINHABITANTS of Mberengwa in Midlands province have implored Parliament to translate the Mines and Minerals Bill to local languages in order to empower communities to address problems bedeviling them through meaningful input when public hearings kick off.\n\nThe Bill, which has gone through several twists and turns since 2015, is seen as a signal marking the departure from the archaic colonial legislation last promulgated in 1961, leaving gaps which the mining companies have taken advantage of over the years.The document was gazetted in June 2025 under General Notice 1243A of 2025 by Clerk of Parliament, Kennedy Chokuda, in terms of Standing Order No.142 (1) of the National Assembly.Speaking during the Silveira House organised district environmental impact assessment dialogue this week, Mberengwa Ward 10 Councillor, Devilious Mashavakure called on Parliament to set out its systems for widespread circulation.Parliament must strive to overcome the language barriers in communities hardest hit by mining activities. The English jargon used in law is often confusing hence the urgent need to roll it out in local languages.So far we appreciate the role being played by community based publications in conscientising the Mberengwa local residents, he said.Mashavakure urged stakeholders and Parliament to work expeditiously and pave the way for the finalisation of the Bill as soon as possible as a strategy to stop the current rampant environmental damage before it goes offhand.Merengwa Ward 16 Councillor, Lovemore Nkomo expressed gratitude over the clauses in the Bill saying it has the potential to address the bulk of problems bedeviling the mining sector.He said the neo-colonial agenda contained in the 1961 Mines and Minerals Act could be a thing of the past once the Bill sails through. He underscored that the document needs to be circulated in local languages way on time ahead of public hearings.Alder Makotore, an Environmental Sub Committee member in the same district implored Parly to urgently insert issues that affect women in mining communities such as destruction of water sources, eradicating sexual harassment, which are not so prominent in Bill.She said mechanisms which guaranteed womens participation during the forthcoming public hearings exercises must be put in place.Silveira House project manager for community-led mining advocacy and governance, Zandile Mvududu said while the Bill presents opportunities to address legacy problems in the mining sector, the Portfolio Committee on Mines must be geared to receive overwhelming feedback from residents.With the Environmental Social Governance (ESG) focus in most mining communities which have been influenced by the efforts to minimise the ESG risks, we feel that the Bill has gained so much momentum in the communities, she said.\n\nThe Bill, which has gone through several twists and turns since 2015, is seen as a signal marking the departure from the archaic colonial legislation last promulgated in 1961, leaving gaps which the mining companies have taken advantage of over the years.\n\nThe document was gazetted in June 2025 under General Notice 1243A of 2025 by Clerk of Parliament, Kennedy Chokuda, in terms of Standing Order No.142 (1) of the National Assembly.Speaking during the Silveira House organised district environmental impact assessment dialogue this week, Mberengwa Ward 10 Councillor, Devilious Mashavakure called on Parliament to set out its systems for widespread circulation.Parliament must strive to overcome the language barriers in communities hardest hit by mining activities.
