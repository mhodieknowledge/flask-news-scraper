The offences involved forced entry into homes and theft of valuables, including laptops, mobile phones, cash and official documents.Among his most serious crimes was count 19, where he threatened a woman, forcibly undressed and raped her before stealing US$750 worth of property.In another matter, armed with a knife he used violence upon a complainant to force them to reveal the location of US$700 cash.Siyabu was arrested after forensic evidence linked him to one of the crime scenes.

Economic empowerment must be genuine, said Chiwenga as he introduced President Emmerson Mnangagwa.We must always remember that we are not the alpha and omega of Zimbabwes journey, ours is to carry forward the torch passed to us by those who gave everything without expectation of reward, he further warned.Chiwenga is in a tight and tense race against businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei to replace Mnangagwa in 2028 although there are concerted efforts to illegally extend the 83-year-old Zanu PF leaders term in office to 2030.Having described Tagwirei, shadowy character Wicknell Chivayo and some of their associates as Zvigananda, a colloquial Zimbabwean term that means criminals, Chiwenga reportedly dropped a dossier last month detailing how billions of US dollars were being siphoned by the monied clique.That was to be later dismissed in this weeks Politburo where Mnangagwa stood his ground and defended Tagwirei, who has been identified as the preferred successor be it in 2028 or 2030.Chiwenga, who sensationally revealed that late liberation war hero General Josiah Tongogara knew that he would not see an independent Zimbabwe, said the much talked about 2030 Agenda must be understood as their duty for future generations rather than their own.He added: Some of them like our late commander General Josiah Magama Tongogara knew they would not see a liberated Zimbabwe.
