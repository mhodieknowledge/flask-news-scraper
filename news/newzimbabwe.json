It is easy to feel helpless and powerless when faced with oppression and injustice.\n\nHowever, as Christians, we are called to live differently, even in the midst of adversity.\n\nIn Psalm 37:1-7, David encourages us not to fret or be envious of those who do evil. Instead, we are to trust in the Lord, do good, and dwell in the land.\n\nThis means that we should focus on living a life that honours God, even when our circumstances are difficult.\n\nIn Romans 13:1-7, Paul reminds us that all authority comes from God. While this doesnt mean that we should blindly obey unjust rulers, it does mean that we should respect the authority that God has established. We can do this by praying for our leaders, paying taxes, and obeying laws that dont contradict Gods Word.\n\nIn 1 Peter 2:13-17, Peter encourages us to submit to every human authority for the Lords sake.\n\nThis doesnt mean that we should compromise our values or principles, but rather that we should live in a way that honours God, even when we disagree with those in authority.\n\nSo, how can we live under a dictatorship government in a way that honours God? Here are a few suggestions:\n\n1. Pray for your leaders, even if you disagree with them. (1 Timothy 2:1-4)\n\n2. Respect the authority that God has established, while also standing up for justice and righteousness. (Romans 13:1-7)\n\n3. Focus on living a life that honours God, rather than GETTING bogged down in politics. (Psalm 37:1-7)\n\n4. Support and encourage one another, especially those who are suffering under oppression. (Galatians 6:2)\n\nPRAYER\n\nDear Heavenly Father,\n\nWe come before you today, praying for our brothers and sisters who are living under dictatorship governments in Africa.\n\nWe ask that you give them wisdom and discernment as they navigate these challenging circumstances.\n\nWe pray that you would protect them from harm and give them courage to stand up for justice and righteousness.\n\nWe ask that you provide for their physical and emotional needs, and that you would give them hope and encouragement in the midst of adversity.\n\nWe pray that you would change the hearts of those in authority, that they would rule with justice and compassion.\n\nAnd we pray that you would bring an end to oppression and injustice, that your people might live in peace and freedom.\n\nIn Jesus name we pray,\n\nAMEN.\n\n",

            "content": "By BBC\n\nTHIRTEEN soldiers serving with peacekeeping forces in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been killed in clashes with rebels from the M23 group.\n\nThe South African military said nine of its soldiers died helping to push back a rebel advance on the city of Goma, in eastern DR Congo, while three Malawians and a Uruguayan were also killed.\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron said he had spoken to the leaders of both DR Congo and Rwanda amid global calls for the violence to end.\n\nThe United Nations is pulling all non-essential staff out of Goma  a city of more than one million people  as the fighting intensifies.\n\nA UN Security Council meeting about the deadly clashes, originally set for Monday, has been moved to Sunday due to the escalating conflict.\n\nThe M23 group has called on Congolese troops in Goma to surrender in order to avoid bloodshed. While DR Congo has severed diplomatic ties with neighbouring Rwanda, accusing the country of being behind the rebellion.\n\nThe move comes after M23 fighters killed a Congolese military governor who was visiting the frontline on Thursday. Earlier in January, they captured the key eastern Congolese towns of Minova and Masisi.\n\nMacron called for an end to the fighting in separate calls with the leaders of DR Congo and Rwanda on Saturday, his office said.\n\nThe EUs foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas urged the M23 to halt its advance and condemned Rwandas support for the group, the AFP news agency reports.\n\nFurther condemnation came from Angolan President Joao Lourenco, the African Unions mediator between Rwanda and DR Congo, who denounced irresponsible actions by the M23 and its supporters and called for the immediate cessation of fighting to preserve civilian lives, according to the AFP news agency.Fighting between the M23 and DR Congos army has intensified since the start of the year, with the rebels seizing control of more territory than ever.\n\nThe conflict has already led more than 400,000 people to flee their homes this year, according to the UN.\n\nLocal leaders last week said more than 200 civilians had been killed in areas captured by the M23, with hospitals in Goma treating hundreds of patients.\n\nMartin Gordon, an Anglican bishop in Goma, told the BBC fighting in the country had gone on way too long and people will do anything for peace.\n\nIn the past few days, several countries have urged their citizens to leave Goma, including the UK, France, Germany and the US.\n\nHuman Rights Watch has warned of escalating risks to civilians as the Congolese army battles the M23 rebels. The humanitarian group has accused both sides of committing grave abuses against civilians.\n\nThe UN has warned that the ongoing conflict is worsening the humanitarian crisis in the region.\n\nThe M23 has taken control of vast swathes of mineral-rich eastern DR Congo since 2021. Hundreds of thousands of people have been displaced as a consequence.\n\nDR Congo and the UN say the M23 is backed by Rwanda. The Rwandan authorities have neither confirmed nor denied this.\n\nRwanda has previously said the authorities in DR Congo were working with some of those responsible for the 1994 Rwandan genocide against ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus.\n\nThe M23 formed as an offshoot of another rebel group in 2012, ostensibly to protect the Tutsi population in the east of DR Congo, which had long complained of persecution and discrimination.\n\nHowever, Rwandas critics accuse it of using the M23 to loot eastern DR Congos minerals such as gold, cobalt and tantalum.\n\n",

You saw it with the audit firms that exited, local partners took over the practice. I was very pleased with that.\n\nIn 2024, Deloitte exited Zimbabwe, and its operations were taken over by Axcentium, a firm led by former Deloitte partners who cited the need for flexibility and agility in Zimbabwes evolving market.\n\nPwC also left the market last year, with Vista Chartered Accountants taking its place.\n\nNot everyone shares Ncubes optimism about the exit of global accounting firms.\n\nWhen such a globally recognised institution exits a market, the ramifications are not just symbolicthey are structural. It reflects systemic economic and governance issues and sends a loud message to both local and international stakeholders about the countrys operating environment, says Brighton Musonza, an accountant and business commentator.\n\nRetailer Choppies announced its departure from Zimbabwe in December, citing the impact of Ncubes exchange rate policies which have decimated formal retail and boosted informal traders. Choppies sold its business Sai Mart, owned by Deputy Minister Raj Modi.\n\nNcube insists: If you look at Choppies, a local investor is taking over the asset. We are not short of local investors who are ready to step in to replace some of these foreign investors.\n\nBut well make sure we step in to address some of the challenges that businesses face. Well work on that to attract new investment and encourage expansion by those who are already on the ground.\n\nLast year, Unilever announced it would exit the country and use local distributors instead to sell its brands in Zimbabwe. This added to a list of other multinationals who have left the country.\n\nStandard Chartered last year sold its business to FBC Holdings for $24 million as it left Zimbabwe and several other markets around the world.\n\nHolcim disposed of its cement plant in Zimbabwe to Fossil in 2022 for $29.7 million. Nampak is currently in the process of selling its 51% stake in the countrys biggest packaging business to TSL for $25 million.\n\n",

Its a hard pill to swallow.\n\nHorrific killing\n\nSentencing Zivanai to life in prison, Judge William Hart said: You were angry and aggressive, and she was cowed by your behaviour.\n\nYou appear to have become convinced that she was in some form of relationship, perhaps an affair, with another man.\n\nThat was, as far as the evidence indicates, a wholly groundless suspicion and that form of jealousy appears to have been a feature of much of your relationship.\n\nThe circumstances of this poor young womans killing were horrific, he added.\n\n",

Some have been turned into tuck shops by informal traders.\n\nMafume acknowledged before the commission that the council has not been benefitting.\n\nCouncil is not benefiting from that state of affairs. They are not being run properly. The absence an ERP, we need a software to manage the various leases and properties that are owned by the council and there was a deliberate effort from management not to put these properties of Council into a system package, companies like Old Mutual and Real Estates companies use it, said Mafume.\n\nWithout disclosing the exact number, Mafume told the commission that there are properties that have disappeared from the radar of the local authority.\n\nYou cannot transfer it to where there is equal chaos because if you transfer its without the reforms there are more properties that are supposed to be managed by CoH that are disappearing and not being managed well, he said.\n\nCouncil has lost control of some its buildings after being grabbed by barons, who now demand rentals from shop owners.\n\nLast year, the commission revealed that the council collected US$100 in the first quarter of 2024 from tuckshop owners, exposing leakages and deep corruption within the municipality.\n\nMafume acknowledged that a Citizens for Change (CCC) councillor leases a property from Rufaro Marketing.\n\nI am not aware of any councillor beyond the one that was revealed, Hunters. At the present moment, I know of one councillor who was linked to Hunters Bar. It was publicised that Councillor Nyakudya was leasing, said Mafume.\n\n",
