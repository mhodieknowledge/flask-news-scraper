            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE streets of Leeds in the United Kingdom (UK) roared with the sound of resistance this Saturday as Zimbabwean nationals and solidarity groups marched 15 kilometres through the city in a protest against tyranny by President Emmerson Mnangagwa back home.\n\nOrganised by the Zimbabwe Human Rights Organisation (ZHRO), the demonstrations went ahead undeterred by recent threats from Mnangagwas government, with participants singing revolutionary songs and chanting calls for democratic change, standing defiant in the face of intimidation.The walk came in the wake of chilling warnings from Zimbabwean authorities, who have vowed to apply the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Amendment Act (2023) against anyoneinside or outside Zimbabwewho tarnishes the image of the so-called Second Republic. Despite this, participants in Leeds said they would not be silenced.We are not afraid, said one marcher.We will continue to speak out against corruption, nepotism, and oppression.The Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) recently confirmed that Blessed Runesu Bombshell Geza, a leading figure in Zimbabwean demonstrations and stay-aways, is now on Interpols watchlist. But rather than deterring action, his listing appears to have further galvanised exiled Zimbabweans and international supporters.The march saw enthusiastic participation from a broad coalition of groups, including members of Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), ZAPU, Mthwakazi Republic Party, and others who joined ZHRO in calling for regime change. Under the blazing summer heat, the spirited crowd kept its energy high, drumming and singing all the way.There was a roar and thunder in Leeds when drums were beaten byParticipants, Ettar Mhlanga and Patson Muzuwa, electrified the atmosphere with energetic drum beating thereby spurring the crowd in a determined move showing that the diaspora community is no longer willing to remain silent.Among the organisers of the walk were, Pamela Magwizi, Mgcini Victor Hlophe, Regina Mahowo, Happiness Ncube, Phylis Melody Magejo, Josephine Jenje-Mudimbu and John Burke.Coordinators Petty Ziramba, Patson Muzuwa, Mavis Mutsvangwa and Shepherd Yuda said the Leeds demonstration was part of a global wave of resistance.In Canada, solidarity protests were led by activist Mellisa Tonderai Tagarira, while in the United States, 19-year-old Bethel Princess Chiyangwa led a demonstration alongside Panashe Vongai Trish Sivindani.

            "content": "By Tapiwa Svondo\n\nOSCAR-nominated American film producer Alix Madigan concluded her week-long Business of Film workshop in Harare, urging the need for a number of formal structures to bolster Zimbabwes film industry.\n\nThe workshop, which was facilitated by the US Embassy, saw Madigan mentoring local filmmakers at the Zimbabwe Film and Television School of Southern Africa (ZIFTESSA).Speaking at the closeout ceremony on Friday, Madigan underscored the need for institutional support such as a film commission and tax incentives to complement the evident local talent.I do think that the future of filmmaking in Zimbabwe is very, very bright and will be very exciting in the years to come.I think if anything, I could recommend, is there be more formal structures in place to support these remarkable filmmakers that are present in this country, things such as the establishment of a film commission, the discussion of a possible tax incentive. But these things do seem to be well underway with the National Arts Council, said Madigan.Becca Archer-Knepper, Public Diplomacy Officer at the U.S. Embassy in Harare, added that challenges in the Zimbabwean film industry are forcing many creatives to pursue opportunities in other international film industries.However, she confirmed that meetings were held with the Ministry of Sport, Arts and Recreation and the National Arts Council to address these challenges.One of the major challenges is a lot of the very creative people end up going other places, whether they go to South Africa or Kenya, or Nigeria, or someplace in Europe or even America to work in the film industry because its more advanced there. And so I think one of the really great things about this workshop is that it brought together a lot of different filmmakers who are keen to build up the industry here in Zimbabwe.There are challenges, but Alix and Dorin Amina Abubakar, whos also on the programme with the American Film showcase, they met with the ministry, they met with the Arts Council, and they discussed different ideas about how they can strengthen the film industry here.There are simple things like making it easier to get film permits to more complex things, like setting up a film hub hub, giving tax breaks and things like that. So, there are some big things and some small things that could really change the film industry here, said Becca.Among the beneficiaries of the workshop was Kudakwashe Rice, a writer, poet, storyteller, and filmmaker, who shared his key takeaways of securing funding, distributing films, and generating returns.I benefited extremely from this programme that I was part of, which was facilitated by the U.S embassy, where they brought in Alix from the United States. Shes an incredible, incredible independent filmmaker, and she got to teach us about the professional aspect of filmmaking and the business aspect of filmmaking as well as being able to find ways where you get to fund your films and also putting your films into distribution and managing to get some returns from that, and to also get returns from that, said Rice.Filmmaker Yeukai Ndirimani, who began her career with Studio 263 in 2002, said the production of films in Zimbabwe is very low and there is little to no money in return.People argue whether we have an industry or not, but we have a community, and we are making films but the rate at which were making productions is very low, and hardly do we ever make money from our films.So this workshop was really very helpful, especially for me, because I am actually currently working on a few productions where I have been trying to find ways to sort of collaborate to to get money to then distribute that content because, its one thing to produce something its another to then get it seen I think my target audience is really like global, so I think this helps because they bring in that global sort of audience so the way that this workshop has helped is that, they have given us resources in terms of orgnisations where we can get our films screened, organisations that fund films people that can partner with us to make films, said Ndirimani.\n\nThe workshop, which was facilitated by the US Embassy, saw Madigan mentoring local filmmakers at the Zimbabwe Film and Television School of Southern Africa (ZIFTESSA).\n\nSpeaking at the closeout ceremony on Friday, Madigan underscored the need for institutional support such as a film commission and tax incentives to complement the evident local talent.I do think that the future of filmmaking in Zimbabwe is very, very bright and will be very exciting in the years to come.I think if anything, I could recommend, is there be more formal structures in place to support these remarkable filmmakers that are present in this country, things such as the establishment of a film commission, the discussion of a possible tax incentive.

It was registered on 28 August 2012.\n\nHowever, allegations are that despite a protracted legal battle which saw the Supreme Court order of 6 February 2025 recognising Tecla Barangwe as the legitimate leader of MPAWUZ, Rigava, in his capacity as the NEC Medical chairperson, has teamed up with other top officials to block the trade unionist.\n\nWe suspect that he is well aware of the surging MPAWUZ membership and the possibility of Barangwe eventually taking over the NEC Medicals helm, asource at the NEC Medical told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nA letter dated June 19, 2025, written by the Labour Ministrys acting registrar M.T Maphaka seen by NewZimbabwe.com, revealed that Rigava has defied the governments directive on the matter.\n\nThe NECs defence that Barangwe could not be co-opted into NEC because the accreditation process for the year 2025 had lapsed was dismissed as inferior after the industry organs failure to produce evidence on how the framework is applied.\n\nSubsequently, the Director of Labour Administration Mr Vusani wrote requesting documents used in accreditation proceedings and remains unanswered by the NEC, said Maphaka.\n\nIn any case, the Ministry emphasised that none of these issues raised above supersedes or diminishes the authority of the Supreme Court Judgment, which explicitly recognises Ms Barangwe as the rightful leader of MPAWUZ and grants her authority to represent the union and its members in NEC meetings.\n\nBy this letter, the NEC is hereby directed to ensure that the legitimate leadership of MPAWUZ is recognised and accorded due representation in the NEC. Your prompt attention to the matter will be highly appreciated, the Ministry ordered.\n\nContacted for comment, Rigava initially developed cold feet and directed the publication to another official at the NEC Medical.\n\nIam away. Urgently talk to Mr Mutukwa. He will handle your questions, he said.\n\nAfter being pressed further to respond to the matter in his capacity as the NEC Medical chairperson, he said, NEC Medical has been to court on the same allegations and was found not guilty.\n\n",
