This will allow families to find closure as they now have the opportunity to bury their loved ones.\n\nSouth Africas Department of Transport has previously confirmed that the crash was caused by a combination of speeding, mechanical failure, and overloading.\n\nA preliminary report into the crash revealed that the bus was overloaded by 23 passengers, half of its brakes were defective, and the driver was travelling at an unsafe speed along a steep, winding mountain pass.\n\nTransport Minister Barbara Creecy and her deputy, Mkhuleko Hlengwa, have officially received the report, which was compiled by the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC).\n\nAccording to the RTMC, a major contributing factor was the drivers excessive speed for the conditions along the mountain descent.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nBUSINESS couple Clark Clever Makoni and Beverly Aisha Ndonda Makoni, accused of defrauding former Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor Gideon Gono, have approached the High Court seeking to overturn a ruling by Regional Magistrate Stanford Mambanje, which dismissed their application for discharge.\n\nIn their court papers, the couple accuses the magistrate of grossly misdirecting himself and creating new charges by placing them on their defence despite what they say is a State case barren of evidence.They cite Mambanje and Prosecutor General Loice Matanda-Moyo as first and second respondents respectively.The first respondent grossly misdirected himself by ignoring that neither the main nor the alternative charge disclosed a valid offence, the application reads.The courts reasoning was so outrageous in its defiance of logic that no sensible court applying its mind could have arrived at it.The Makonis, represented by Admire Rubaya of Rubaya and Chatambudza Legal Practitioners, argue that their prosecution is a failed fishing expedition.The State is acting like a soccer player who has dived at the centre circle of a soccer pitch and clamouring to the referee to be awarded a penalty. This is clearly unacceptable and untenable, the application states.The couple is jointly charged with fraud and corruptly using a false document after allegedly altering company directorship details of Valley Lodge (Pvt) Ltd in 2017. The State alleges they removed Ayoob Omar and Mohammed Hussein Omar as directors and replaced them with their own names to take control of the lodges accounts.But the applicants say the State failed to prove any misrepresentation, intent, or prejudice.There is no way the accused persons can be placed onto the defence in circumstances where the essential elements of the offence of fraud have not been set out, they said.As it stands, the charge of fraud is barren as it lacks the essential averments required to make it a valid one.They also accused the magistrate of overstepping his judicial role.This Honourable Court has no discretion to usurp the States responsibilities as the dominus litis and proceed to recreate new particulars and averments for the alleged charge of fraud, the couple argued.It must avoid the temptation of making a bidding for the State. It laid its bed, it must lie on it.The couple further claims the States witnesses exonerated them by confirming that Valley Lodges directorship had not changed since 2009, contradicting the fraud allegations.There was a clear concession by all the critical witnesses that the directors of Valley Lodge (Pvt) Ltd have remained the same as from 2009 till today, they submitted. This concession clearly exonerated the accused persons.They also argue the State failed to prove that they withdrew any funds from the lodges bank account, allegedly amounting to US$70,000.The State never led any evidence showing that there was any withdrawal from the account in question, the defence stated. There were no withdrawal slips nor any documentary evidence to that effect.Makoni and Ndonda further challenge the authenticity of the alleged fraudulent CR14 form, saying it was never proven to have been authored or signed by them.None of the witnesses said they saw any of the accused creating or signing the alleged CR14 in issue. The State failed to prove as a matter of fact that the accused authored the document, they said.They dismissed the case as baseless.A criminal trial is not a fishing expedition. The accused persons should not be put to their defence hoping that along the way they will convict themselves out of their own mouths. This is a classical failed fishing expedition where the State has failed to even catch a small frog or a kapenta.The couple wants the High Court to review and set aside Mambanjes ruling and substitute it with a verdict of not guilty, arguing that the magistrates decision was rendered without jurisdiction and cannot stand.The matter is yet to be heard.\n\nIn their court papers, the couple accuses the magistrate of grossly misdirecting himself and creating new charges by placing them on their defence despite what they say is a State case barren of evidence.\n\nThey cite Mambanje and Prosecutor General Loice Matanda-Moyo as first and second respondents respectively.The first respondent grossly misdirected himself by ignoring that neither the main nor the alternative charge disclosed a valid offence, the application reads.The courts reasoning was so outrageous in its defiance of logic that no sensible court applying its mind could have arrived at it.The Makonis, represented by Admire Rubaya of Rubaya and Chatambudza Legal Practitioners, argue that their prosecution is a failed fishing expedition.The State is acting like a soccer player who has dived at the centre circle of a soccer pitch and clamouring to the referee to be awarded a penalty.

Among the key creditors were ZESA Holdings, the National Social Security Authority (NSSA), and several urban councils in Bulawayo, Harare, and Chinhoyi.Speaking to the media last year, MIF CEO, John Mangudya explained the importance of working within the countrys legal framework.We are engaging with the creditors and the business practitioner to ensure that everything is done according to the law. After these discussions, well settle with the creditors and look at how best we can resuscitate CSC.The turnaround has now reached a major milestone. The long recovery process, which aimed to revive CSC and protect jobs, has seen significant progress, following years of financial strain that nearly led to the companys collapse. The latest notice, published over the weekend, confirms that the corporate rescue plan has been substantially implemented.In line with legal requirements, a notice was filed with the Master of the High Court, announcing that the corporate rescue plan for CSC, which was adopted by affected stakeholders on April 15, 2025, has now been successfully executed.The corporate rescue process for CSC officially ended on October 16, 2025, according to a statement from the outgoing corporate rescue practitioner, Crispen Mwete.Control of operations will now be handed back to the companys management and board, with all future inquiries directed to them, the notice stated.CSC has faced ongoing challenges in maintaining profitable operations and was on the brink of liquidation due to mounting debt and pressure from creditors.Factors such as financial mismanagement, allegations of corruption, and a deteriorating operational environment contributed to its insolvency, further complicated by a heightened risk profile that made it difficult to attract new investment or secure working capital.\n\nOver the past year, MIF has been at the forefront of a comprehensive effort to rehabilitate CSC, engaging with creditors and tackling a significant debt burden of approximately US$130 million.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nELITE Bryden Country School in Chegutu, Mashonaland West, has accused the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) of granting questionable authority to a Chinese-owned firm to establish a cement factory nearly 500 metres from the school.\n\nEMA is accused of issuing an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report giving the project a greenlight despite strong environmental and health concerns from stakeholders, including the school.In a letter to parents dated October 23, 2025, Brydens Board of Governors chairperson A. Noor said the High Court, presided over by Justice Mandaza, had lifted the provisional order that had stopped Shuntai Investments (Pvt) Limited from proceeding with construction until all environmental and regulatory requirements were met.The High Court discharged the provisional order issued in March that suspended Shuntai from implementing the cement plant project until all the necessary documentation was in place and compliant, Noor said.Sadly, this latest ruling means that Shuntai continues as they have been doing all along.Bryden expressed frustration with EMAs decision to grant Shuntai an EIA certificate even as the school and nearby residents continued to raise red flags over toxic emissions, noise pollution, and the projects proximity to several educational institutions.We were assured by the EMA Board that Shuntai has been issued an EIA certificate with special conditions, Noor said.We have made several requests to EMA to disclose all of these special conditions. It is worth noting that the certificate can be removed at any time for non-compliance.The school insists that the EIA process was flawed and that the current certificate contradicts the actual activities taking place on the ground.We will still appeal to the Director General of EMA as there are serious discrepancies in the ESIA report, Noor stated.What is happening on the ground is not in keeping with the report on which the certificate was granted.Bryden says the EIA dispute has become the focal point of its ongoing legal and environmental campaign against Shuntai, accusing the regulator of rubber-stamping an assessment that ignored critical health, zoning, and safety concerns.The school has also appealed to the Minister of Environment and plans to escalate the matter to the Administrative Court. Noor said these efforts are aimed at protecting pupils from what the school describes as toxic dust, noxious fumes and blasting noise coming from the construction site.Despite the High Court setback, Noor assured parents that the school remains determined to fight on.We remain optimistic and continue to trust that Bryden will be safe, he said.We are grateful for all of the support we have received through this most trying time.He urged parents to sign its petition and contribute to a GoFundMe campaign to support the legal battle.The feud between the school, EMA and Shuntai has intensified since Shuntai defied an earlier March High Court order to stop work at its Eastbourne site.The school says heavy machinery, blasting and dust emissions have continued to threaten the health and safety of its pupils.There are serious discrepancies between what was approved and what is actually happening, Noor warned.We will not relent until the safety of Bryden children is guaranteed.\n\nEMA is accused of issuing an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) report giving the project a greenlight despite strong environmental and health concerns from stakeholders, including the school.\n\nIn a letter to parents dated October 23, 2025, Brydens Board of Governors chairperson A.
