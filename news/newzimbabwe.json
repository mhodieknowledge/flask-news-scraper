Food plays a central role in the celebrations.Families prepare a variety of traditional Indian sweets which are shared with friends and neighbours. Festive meals often include rich curries, savoury snacks, and special breads.In the days leading up to the festival, people clean and decorate their homes, shop for new clothes, and buy traditional sweets to exchange as gifts with friends and family.Many also create traditional and colourful rangoli designs outside their doors to invite luck and positivity. On Diwali itself, families worship Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth.Diwalis appeal goes beyond religion, drawing people from different communities and faiths to join in the celebrations.Across Indias cities and towns, markets bustle with shoppers buying sweets, gifts, decorations, and firecrackers, giving a significant boost to the economy each year.\n\nWhile lamps and firecrackers light up homes and streets during the festival, they also worsen air pollution  a problem especially pronounced in northern India, where winter months already bring poor air quality.\n\nThis year, the Supreme Court has permitted the sale and use of green crackers in the capital, Delhi, to help curb air pollution, ending a ban on crackers that has been in place since 2020.Green crackers claim to emit 2030% less pollution than traditional firecrackers, but critics doubt their actual effectiveness in protecting the environment.In recent years, several states have restricted or banned firecrackers to combat rising air pollution, but the rules are often flouted, further worsening air quality in the days after Diwali.Authorities have been cracking down on traditional firecrackers as pollution levels riseBut Diwali is about much more than fireworks.

Mawuka succumbed to his injuries the following day in hospital.\n\nThe court dismissed Mpofus defences of provocation and self-defence as highly improbable and bordered on falsehoods.\n\nMzawazi noted that all the falsehoods in the accuseds story cumulatively expose his guilt Both defences of provocation and self-defence are unsustainable and outrightly rejected.\n\nOn sentencing, the judge noted the need for deterrence.\n\nThe degree of blameworthiness is on the higher side given that a dangerous weapon was used with fatal consequences. A clear message must be sent that killings over trivialities must be stopped. Life is valuable.\n\nMpofu was sentenced to 12 years for murder and three years for culpable homicide, but the terms will run concurrently, meaning he will serve 12 years in total.\n\nThe court acknowledged his troubled upbringing and exposure to artisanal mining violence but insisted justice must balance mercy with public confidence.\n\nA deterrent sentence is necessary, so as not to shake societal confidence in the criminal justice system and to warn others of the consequences of taking the law into their own hands.\n\n",

Their whole conduct showed that they were aware of their unlawful possession.The court said the argument that they were within the 15-day window under section 77 of the Parks and Wildlife Regulations was misplaced because the provision only applies to lawfully acquired ivory.Ignorance of the law is no defence. The belief held by the appellants was not sufficient to cover their conduct with legality, the judgment stated.The judges further noted that the duos decision to travel from Lupane to Bulawayo under the cover of night and Sibandas attempt to run away from police undermined their story.If their possession was lawful, they would have behaved in a completely different way, the court said, adding that the claim of expecting a reward was not reasonably true as the offices concerned do not give out rewards.\n\nThe court ruled that their defence of intending to surrender the tusks was meritless and legally unsustainable.\n\nJustices Rita Makarau Guvava, Susan Makoni, and Felistas Chatukuta recently dismissed the appeal by Hlupani Austin Sibanda and Ellmone Nkomo, who were earlier sentenced by a Bulawayo magistrate to 11 years and 9 years imprisonment respectively for contravening section 82(1) of the Parks and Wildlife (General) Regulations.The pair was arrested in April 2024 carrying a 21.75-kilogram sack of unmarked ivory pieces.According to the court record, Sibanda attempted to flee and only stopped when detectives from the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) Minerals, Flora and Fauna Unit fired a warning shot.In their defence, the men claimed they had picked up the tusks in Lupane while herding cattle and were on their way to surrender them to Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife offices in Bulawayo for a reward.They argued that the law gave them a 15-day grace period to hand over the ivory.But the Supreme Court found their explanation implausible.The appellants did not acquire the ivory lawfully and in turn could not lawfully possess it for registration purposes.

We hope that will remain the case in the future, which is why, as we discuss increasing volumes, we have chosen to walk together with them to reach our goal of 500 million kilograms, said Masuka.While about 10 percent of Zimbabwes tobacco leaf is currently processed locally, less than one percent is made into cigarettes, a market segment Zimbabwe now seeks to enter, Masuka said.Through collaboration with China, Zimbabwe aims to ensure that the bulk of its tobacco is processed locally to create jobs, boost export earnings and strengthen the countrys industrial base, he said.Masuka added that Zimbabwe could also benefit from acquiring advanced cigarette manufacturing equipment from China to further enhance value addition and beneficiation.Patrick Devenish, chairman of the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board, said China has long been a pillar of Zimbabwes tobacco trade.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has overturned the 20-year jail term imposed on a Mudzi man, William Smoko, who had been convicted of rape, blasting the lower court for convicting him on speculative, contradictory, and uncorroborated evidence.\n\nIn a recent judgment delivered by judges of appeal, Justices Esther Muremba and Deputy Judge President Munyaradzi Mawadze, the High Court found that the State had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, ruling that the complainants story was riddled with inconsistencies and credibility gaps.I am unable to conclude that the State proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, Muremba ruled.She added that the magistrates analysis fell far short of the rigorous scrutiny required in criminal trials where the liberty of an accused person is at stake.Smoko had been convicted of raping a 34-year-old woman from a neighbouring village following a long-running feud over a faulty cellphone and a missing shovel. The alleged incident was said to have occurred after the woman accused Smoko of cheating her in a phone swap deal and later of stealing gold ore from her husbands artisanal mining venture.But the High Court said these prior disputes cast serious doubt on the complainants motives.These circumstances cast a shadow over her motives and raise legitimate concerns about possible fabrication of the rape allegations, Muremba said.The court described the complainants version as both contradictory and implausible, noting that she claimed Smoko assaulted her in broad daylight, reported him to the police, and yet chose to sleep alone with only a three-year-old child that same night despite fearing his return.The absence of any meaningful explanation for these decisions raises serious doubts about the reliability of her version of events, the judge said.Muremba further criticised the magistrate for relying on unverified assumptions.At no point during the trial did the accused admit to visiting the complainants homestead on the date in question It was therefore incorrect for the learned regional magistrate to conclude that it was common cause that the accused had gone to the complainants homestead.The judge also faulted the State for failing to produce key evidence, including the torn clothing the complainant claimed had been ripped during the alleged assault.The absence of such physical evidence, particularly when its existence is explicitly claimed, significantly undermines the credibility of the complainants testimony, she ruled.On the medical findings, Justice Muremba noted that the report only showed healed hymenal tears inconsistent with a recent sexual assault and that the bruises could not conclusively be linked to the alleged rape.The High Court found that the magistrate had wrongly dismissed the defence evidence, including that of Smokos wife, who testified that her husband was at home on the night of the alleged attack.The courts conclusion that the accuseds wife had placed him at the complainants homestead is speculative and unsupported by the evidence.The court then ruled that the inconsistencies, contradictions, and lack of corroboration rendered the conviction unsafe.A conviction must rest on evidence that is persuasive and free from reasonable doubt.That is not the case here.The liberty of the accused is at stake. The credibility of the complainant must be evaluated in light of all relevant circumstances, including any potential motive to mislead.Smokos conviction and sentence were accordingly set aside.\n\nIn a recent judgment delivered by judges of appeal, Justices Esther Muremba and Deputy Judge President Munyaradzi Mawadze, the High Court found that the State had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, ruling that the complainants story was riddled with inconsistencies and credibility gaps.\n\nI am unable to conclude that the State proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, Muremba ruled.She added that the magistrates analysis fell far short of the rigorous scrutiny required in criminal trials where the liberty of an accused person is at stake.Smoko had been convicted of raping a 34-year-old woman from a neighbouring village following a long-running feud over a faulty cellphone and a missing shovel.
