            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nOUTSPOKEN politician Temba Mliswa has denied allegations of luring Walter Mzembi back to Zimbabwe for incarceration, claiming the former cabinet minister was living in fear after a fallout with exiled ex-ZANU PF commissar Saviour Kasukuwere.\n\nMzembi returned to Zimbabwe after seven years of exile and has been in pretrial detention for violating his 2018 bail conditions.\n\nAt the centre of his return and subsequent arrest was allegedly Mliswa, an accusation which he denies.\n\nThe Mzembi issue is an unfortunate exhibition of callous politicians conveniently altering facts and pseudo-journalists crafting an alternative reality for excitable masses to imbibe on. Its a total shame to accuse me or anyone of enticing him back. This was his own idea, said Mliswa in a social media post.\n\nMliswa said the return of Mzembi was of his own volition due to fear of Kasukuwere after a fallout.\n\nThe facts are verifiable. There was never any CIO operation because Mzembi approached me as he wanted to return. One major reason is that he had split with Kasukuwere. For more than a year and half they have never spoke. He felt unsafe which is why he moved from SA to Zambia!\n\nAll this talk about me selling him out is noonday hogwash. Im no spy and never worked for CIO. Characters like Ali Naka, are merely (social media) guns for hire operating as Sekuru Tysons instruments. Ali is working for his food and will peddle any nonsense he is fed.\n\nInstead, they should admit how Mzembi was pushed back here due to fear of Kasukuwere as he no longer felt safe. He crafted his own idea, approached me to facilitate engagements with the relevant powers. Which I did. What part of those actions constitutes enticing him back? said Mliswa.\n\nThe alleged fallout between Kasukuwere and Mzembi comes as a surprise, as the two had been as thick as thieves and worked together during the 2023 election season.\n\nNow languishing in prison, Mzembi is reportedly ill as he awaits the commencement of his trial.\n\nI have always advocated for the return of everyone in exile. For both times involving Mzembi and Kasukuwere in 2018 when approached I simply spoke with the powers that be and facilitated engagements between the parties. Whatever else they agreed or didnt, I was never part of!\n\nAccusations of betrayal are outright fabrications by individuals like Ali Naka who are mere marionettes in this charade. Mzembi is not a victim of anything I did but of that which compelled him to flee from SA. Whatever agreements they spoke about back here I was never part of, added Mliswa.\n\n",

            "content": "By Andile Masuku, IOL\n\nA crypto entrepreneur posting as@goodalexanderon X recently offered some disconcertingobservationsabout powerful people and truth-telling. His cynical take  that Warren Buffetts folksy investment wisdom and Peter Thiels contrarian innovation insights might be theatrical misdirection  feels particularly relevant when applied to how we discuss Africas digital transformation.\n\nThese musings come alongside @goodalexanders promotion ofPost Fiat, a blockchain project that reimagines XRPs consensus mechanism with AI-driven validator selection. Whether his X handle reflects genuine identity or careful branding around good intentions, his scepticism about curated reality deserves journalistic scrutiny.\n\nSide-bar:XRP is a cryptocurrency created in 2012 by developers David Schwartz, Jed McCaleb, and Arthur Britto. Unlike Bitcoin, all 100 billion XRP tokens were created upfront, with most going to Ripple Labsthe company that helped develop it. XRP runs on its own blockchain designed for fast, cheap international payments, though Ripple doesnt actually own the network.\n\nEmpire fragments\n\nTheres something almost poetic about someone called Alexander critiquing the machinery of influence. The original Alexander (the Great) succeeded miserably at conquering the world, dying young after swiftly taking over vast territories that immediately fragmented. Perhaps our modern Alexanders insights about fabricated methodologies and post-truth economics carry similar warnings about the sustainability of narratives built on strategic misdirection.\n\nThis scepticism is a handy tool for weighing how we discuss Africas digital transformation. We celebrate mobile money penetration statistics while sidestepping questions about whose systems actuallypowerthis leapfrogging. We herald blockchain fixes for financial inclusion while rarelyexaminingwhether these primarily extract value to foreign tech conglomerates.\n\nPayment rails\n\nTake Zimbabwes EcoCash, operated by Econet Wireless. The platforms partnerships reveal the intricate web of global alliances that define modern African fintech.EcoCash Diaspora, a nifty product innovation that my family recently found handy for channelling financial lovegifts to my mother from all over the world following my fathers death, facilitates remittances from Zimbabweans abroad through partnerships with Shoprite, WorldRemit, M-Pesa, MTN and other international money transfer agents.\n\nMasterCardsinvolvementruns deeper than simple processing. The company has reportedly issued over 3 million MasterCard debit cards linked to EcoCash accounts, creating Zimbabwes largest EMV chip and PIN card rollout and allowing customers to withdraw money from MasterCard-licensed ATMs whilst paying for goods locally and internationally.\n\nThe same underlying infrastructure also supports newer market entrants like InDrive. The Russian ride-hailing platform, which operates on a haggling model where passengers name their price, accepts EcoCash and MasterCard payments for wallet top-ups. Even though the extent of MasterCards direct role in facilitating InDrives aggressive Zimbabwe expansion lacks detailed public documentation, the payment options clearly build on the existing EcoCash-MasterCard ecosystem that has already reduced barriers for international platforms seeking local market access.\n\nCurated realities\n\nThe arrangement illustrates @goodalexanders point about curated realities. From one angle, its a success story about African fintech systems driving financial inclusion. MasterCards 3 million debit cards represent the largest such rollout in Zimbabwes history, while EcoCash Diaspora processes an increasingly significant portion of total remittances into the country. From another, it demonstrates how global payment networks create pathways for foreign platform market penetration, with transaction fees and data flowing through multiple international intermediaries.\n\nEcoCash benefits from increased transaction volume, MasterCard collects processing fees, InDrive gains market access, and Zimbabwean consumers get cheaper rides, but the value capture primarily accrues outside the local economy.\n\nThis success story operates within the same structural constraints that necessitated its existence: currency volatility, limited formal banking penetration, and regulatory uncertainty that can see mobile money agents nabbed for facilitating transactions in ways that suddenly fall afoul of fiscal and monetary policy oversight.\n\nSimilar complexities emerge when examiningChinese involvementin African technology systems. Cameroons CamTel partnership with Huawei to expand 4G coverage across the country genuinely improved telecommunications access in underserved regions, connecting rural communities to digital services for the first time. Simultaneously, it embedded Chinese technology standards and created dependencies on Huaweis technical expertise and equipment supply chains.\n\nSteel cuts\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that both narratives can be simultaneously accurate. Zimbabwes Manhize steel plant, a joint venture between Chinese firm Tsingshan and local partners, nowproducessteel that competes directly with South African manufacturers in regional markets. ArcelorMittal South Africa and other domestic producers haveraised concernsabout cheap Zimbabwean steel imports undermining their pricing structures and threatening local employment.\n\nZimbabwes steel industry revival, financed by Chinese capital and technology, potentially destabilises South Africas manufacturing base, even as Beijing emerges as the primary beneficiary of both countries steel consumption patterns.\n\nThese dualities extend beyond individual projects to systemic questions about agency and self-determination.\n\nWhen Lagos-based fintech companies integrate with international payment processors to serve African diaspora communities, theyre solving real problems while also channelling transaction fees to foreign financial infrastructure. When Sub-Saharan African AI researchers collaborate with European institutions onAI for good projects, theyre building local capacity while potentially training algorithms that offshore critical IP and analytical potential which primarily serve Global North applications.\n\nNarrative honesty\n\nIginio Gagliardone, professor of media studies at Wits University and inauguralSARChI SA-UK Bilateral Chair in Digital Humanities, speaks of using technology to reimagine more humane ways of interfacing with digital development, pointing toward something crucial: the need to centre historically marginalised forms of knowledge rather than simply adopting external approaches wholesale.\n\nYet heres where @goodalexanders cynicism about fabricated methodologies becomes most relevant. If powerful actors routinely say whatever serves their immediate objectives  whether thats attracting investment capital or maintaining market position  how do we distinguish between genuine transformation and sophisticated marketing?\n\nFirst-party data\n\n@goodalexanders observation about the only data worth anything being first-party study and collection becomes essential here. We cannot afford to rely on others curated interpretations of our own transformation. When I reflect on CamTels relationship with Huawei or analyse Zimbabwes retail sector challenges, the goal is to place progress within the full complexity of whats actually happening.\n\nThe question becomes whether were tellingcomplete storiesthat serve the next generations ability to make genuinely informed choices about their digital futures.\n\nThe Venn diagram where digital economy meets real economy exists precisely in this space of complexity. Digital banking thrives in markets where traditional banking failed, operating within the samestructural constraintsthat caused that failure. AI-powered systems promise efficiency gains whilstraising questionsabout whose intelligence is being optimised and toward what ends.\n\nPerhaps the most honest approach acknowledges that transformation narratives inevitably serve multiple audiences with different objectives. The challenge for those of us documenting these changes is to be transparent about whose interests our framing serves whilst resisting the temptation to oversimplify for the sake of compelling stories.\n\nCounter algorithm\n\nIf @goodalexander, whoever stands behind that handle, is correct about powerful peoples relationship with truth-telling, then our responsibility as journalists, or indeed quasi-journalists, becomes critical. Someone needs to document whats actually happening, rather than what various interested parties want us to believe is happening.\n\nThe algorithms of influence operate through narrative as much as code. Our counter-algorithm might simply be: radical honesty about complexity, even when complexity is less marketable than tantalising transformation myths.\n\nAndile Masuku is Co-founder and Executive Producer atAfrican Tech Roundup.

Razas previous best was the second position that he attained in December 2023.\n\nRazas aggregate of 151 runs also lifted him nine places to 22nd position in the batting rankings, which is two places off his career-best 24th position reached in June 2023. He has also gained one spot to reach 38th position among bowlers.\n\nSri Lanka opener Pathum Nissanka, who topped the aggregate with 198 runs to be named the Player of the Series, has moved up seven places to 13th position while Janith Liyanage (up 13 places to 29th) of Sri Lanka and Sean Williams of Zimbabwe (up three places to 47th) are others to move up the batting rankings after the series.\n\nScotland batter George Munsey is up three places to 34th after a match-winning 84 not out against Canada in the ICC Mens Cricket World Cup League 2 while South Africas Tony de Zorzi has moved from 67th to 64th.\n\nThe ODI bowling rankings see South Africa spinner Keshav Maharaj shake off Sri Lanka spinner Maheesh Theekshana to take the sole No. 1 position after a match-winning haul of four for 22 in the first ODI against England in Leeds with Jofra Archer (up six places to 19th) and Lungi Ngidi (up five places to joint-23rd) among the others to move up the bowling rankings after the match.\n\nAsitha Fernando has advanced six places to 31st while Dilshan Madushankas match-winning four for 62 in the first Harare ODI, that included a hat-trick, has lifted him from 60th to 52nd position.\n\nThe ICC Mens T20I Player Rankings see Afghanistan batters Ibrahim Zadran and Sediqullah Atal make huge progress after helping beat Pakistan in a tri-series match in Sharjah with scores of 65 and 64, respectively. Zadran is up 12 places to 20th while Atal has rocketed 346 places to 127th position.\n\nPakistan batters Hasan Nawaz (up two places to joint-31st) is among those to gain in the batting rankings while Sufiyan Muqeem (up 11 places to 22nd), Shaheen Afridi (up eight places to 26th and Mohammad Nawaz (up 15 places to 43rd) are among those to move up the bowling rankings.\n\nRazas upward movement may have resulted in Nabi slipping to third position in the ODI all-rounders list, but he has moved up one spot to second position among T20I all-rounders.\n\n",

Demand forgated communities, cluster housing, andserviced standsis expected to remain strong, while interest spreads beyond Harare into growth hubs like Victoria Falls, Mutare, and Gweru.\n\nFor Zimbabweans abroad, property is more than an investment it is a symbol of belonging, security, and hope for the future.\n\n",

These costs include severance payments and other termination costs.\n\nTotal assets closed the period at ZWG7.8 billion, up 6% from ZWG7.4 billion as at 31 December 2024.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nHUMAN rights defenders have criticised the recent bombing of opposition leader Job Sikhalas Chitungwiza home, amid fears of a renewed wave of raids on properties linked to exiled Zimbabweans.\n\nThe alleged bombing of Sikhalas house while he was away in South Africa raises the spectre of a fresh campaign of political persecution, says human rights activist Munacho Humbasha.\n\nHe says the attack on Sikhalas house is a chilling message to critics of Zanu PF, both at home and abroad.\n\nSikhala, a former legislator and long-time government critic, has been frequenting South Africa for medical and political engagements.\n\nHumbasha told NewZimbabwe.com that Zanu PF functionaries and State security agents have openly declared war on activists in the diaspora, with families back home being deliberately targeted.\n\nThose with houses visited in the widening campaign and searches include that of Petty Ziramba, Panganayi Mauzinyu, Ralph Dube, Fransisca Chiduku, and Shepherd Yuda, said Humbasha.\n\nIn Mabvuku, unknown men believed to be State agents raided the home of the late opposition activist Tonderai Ndira. The assailants took household property and left the house empty, promising to return and destroy their livelihoods. The family is still in shock.\n\nIn Harare, suspected operatives broke into Blessing Makeyis house and again into his family home, allegedly searching for incriminating material. Makevi has been active in diaspora protests against President Emmerson Mnangagwas government, Humbasha told NewZimbabwe.com in an interview.\n\nAlso, another dissenter, Ralph Dubes family, is living in uncertainty after receiving threatening messages, says Humbasha.\n\nBack home, he further claimed, several homes in Seke, Chitungwiza, having been visited by suspicious individuals in recent days, thereby sparking fears in the community.\n\nDespite repeated reports of break-ins and intimidation, police have not arrested anyone in connection with the incidents. Efforts to get a comment from police national spokesman, Commissioner Paul Nyathi, were fruitless by the time of publishing.\n\nVictims and their families say the inaction points to the States complicity.\n\nThis is meant to punish those of us who are in the UK and elsewhere. Our families are being harassed everyday because we speak out, said UK-based activist, Melody Magejo, who spoke to NewZimbabwe.com in a telephone interview.\n\nA human rights lawyer, who preferred anonymity, said as Mnangagwa gravitates towards entrenching his rule through his 2030 agenda, the political environment is set to worsen.\n\nThe use of Patriotic Act and Cyber Security Act 2023 will lead to many arrests of those who are actively participating in campaigns on social media.\n\nIt is without a doubt that Mnangagwas government does not want the outside world to know what is happening in the country, said the lawyer.\n\n",
