            "content": "By Noel T Ngangira\n\nPut aside the recent political turmoil, Mozambique set in motion an energy juggernaut plan that left many African nations drooling in awe.\n\nLets rewind a bit. In 2023, energy exports from coal, gas, and electricity topped US$5.8 billion. Coal led the pack with $3.4 billion, followed by gas at $1.73 billion and electricity ($658 million). 80% of its electricity exports went to SA and 15.4% to Zimbabwe.\n\nWith 180 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves mainly in the Rovuma Basin off the coast of Cabo Delgado, Mozambique is only bettered by Nigeria (with 203 trillion cubic feet) in Africa. It ranks 14th in the world. Energy giants TotalEnergies (France), Exxon Mobil (USA), Eni (Italy) and CNPC (China) are the key LNG operators in Mozambique.\n\nCahora Bassa Hydro power station in Tete province has a power generation capacity of 2,075MW, and plans are underway to increase it to 4,000MW. The following hydroelectric power plants are also in the pipeline and will be online between 2027 and 2031: Mphanda Nkuwa, 1,500MW (Tete); Chemba, 1,000 MW (Sofala); Lupata, 650MW (Tete); and Boroma, 210MW (Tete). This is hydropower only; there is solar and thermal to boot.\n\nFor comparison, Zimbabwe generates about 1,500MW but has an installed capacity of about 2,240MW (hydro and thermal). According to the 2022 Population and Housing Census, 62% of Zimbabwes population has access to electricity  though its not mentioned how many hours per day was/is the electricity actually available.\n\nAccording to the International Trade Administration (ITA), Mozambique aims to achieve universal electrification by 2030. Significant strides to achieve this goal have been made. It moved from 34% in 2021 to 48% in 2022 in terms of population with access to electricity. With the investments made and the work in progress, energy for all is within reach for sure.\n\nThe Mozambican government plans an additional 14,000MW of green energy (hydro) between 2030 and 2040. In its energy transition strategy document, the government plans a whooping US$80 billion investment in the energy sector by 2050. Serious stuff!\n\nITA adds that Mozambique has the largest power generation potential of all Southern African countries. Power Africa estimates that the nation could generate 187 gigawatts (187,000MW) of power from coal, hydro, gas, wind, and solar.\n\nSources include Global Data, Club Mozambique, International Trade Administration (ITA), Power Africa, ADB COP28, and UNICEF.\n\nNoel T Ngangira writes in his personal capacity.

As I confuse thyself in the bars of the prison that is my mind.\n\nThis journey has been a tapestry woven with threads of trials and triumphs. Each moment a stitch in the fabric of the collective nation called GAFA, said Winky D.\n\nIn this tumultuous year, Winky D discovered flickers of joy amid the shadows. As the year 2024 drew to a close, he faced significant hurdles that threatened to overwhelm him.\n\nOne of the most challenging moments was losing his beloved venue, the Harare International Conference Centre (HICC), known affectionately as paJabuna, where he has hosted his iconic New Years Eve shows.\n\nDespite securing the place as early as May 2024, the venue was in a biased manner given to gospel musician Everton Mlalazi, who has strong ties to the Zanu PF acolyte Kudakwashe Tagwirei.\n\nThis unexpected setback was a heavy blow for the artist, who expressed, Amidst the tempest, we found flickers of joy and connection through music. Towards the end, I faced hurdles that overwhelmed my feeble heart.\n\nAnxiety gripped me as I pondered how to close this chapter on a high note, said the dreadlocked artist.\n\nThe loss of the HICC venue was described as sabotage, yet, amidst this uncertainty, a beacon of hope emerged as his loyal fans in the United Kingdom and Bulawayo embraced his last shows of the year.\n\nYour presence at my live shows in the UK and Bulawayo became the beacon of light during dark hours!\n\nDances on the edge of uncertainty, anxiety and excitement fought within me. But you, the Gafas, sang along. Hope flickered anew.\n\nYour unwavering loyalty and vibrant enthusiasm reminded me of the profound unbreakable bond we have shared over the years.\n\nBefore the HICC debacle, Winky D in 2023 faced a ban on State media over Eureka Eureka, only to be unbanned in 2024 according to NewZimbabwe.com sources.\n\nHowever, certain songs from Winky Ds Eureka Eureka album, such as Ibotso and Dzimba Dzemabwe, remain banned.\n\nDuring his 2023-2024 New Years Eve concert, Winky D acknowledged the impact of the blackout on his music.\n\nFrom 2004 up until 2024, 2023 was the most difficult year for me musically, said Winky D.\n\nI could not get an interview on the radio for the show. I only had the internet and dreams and then you (fans), he further said.\n\nAs the new year dawns, the GAFA, stands ready to embrace whatever challenges and triumphs await, thanking his fans for their love and loyalty towards him and his Vigilance Band.\n\nEach note I play and every lyric I sing is dedicated to you. Your energy fuels my creativity and commitment to our cause. Thank you for being my strength during these trying times.\n\nYour support transcends words; it is a lifeline that propels me forward. Together, let us carry this momentum into the new year, embracing both challenges and triumphs that might await us on the horizon.\n\nHappy Twenty Twenty Strive, he wrote.\n\n",

Do you think they would fail to love you for your goodness or for your excellent deeds? Do you think that even God Himself would fail to add blessings on top of others? Out of respect for you, we give you honor; your dignity will forever be associated with your name. Your actions increase the glory of Gods goodness, said Jah\n\nThe award-winning artists praises to Chivayo have alienated the very fans who have supported him through thick and thin, many of whom are disillusioned by the rampant corruption that has plagued their lives.\n\nBELOW IS JAH PRAYZAH SHONA STATEMENT CONVERTED TO ENGLISHYou were born with an open hand that uplifts the orphans, the widows and less privileged.

Do you think they would fail to love you for your goodness or for your excellent deeds? Do you think that even God Himself would fail to add blessings on top of others? Out of respect for you, we give you honor; your dignity will forever be associated with your name. Your actions increase the glory of Gods goodness.\n\nEverything you plan with your efforts may it succeed, may you be added with more wisdom because it enhances wealth through unification and reconciliation.\n\nMay your health be preserved because it is the primary wealth. Continue to wipe away the tears of people because those are the blessings you have received. Happy new year to you, my brother Sir Wicknell.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nEVEN though public health facilities continue providing HIV and AIDS medication with more players tackling the endemic, dealing with the condition, sexual reproductive health and rights (SRHR) issues, focus on the subject seems to be taking a dead seat, an activist has said.\n\nMartha Todhlana told media health practitioners during a Media and Science Cafe Programme in Harare recently that it was sad to note HIV counselling issues had declined with a lot of people now out of support programmes and no longer getting some health services such as health checks and or monitoring.\n\nOnce the universal programme started to say anyone who tests can just test and treat, I think issues of counselling have declined and also people not seeing the need for being in support groups.\n\nYou will find that currently, a lot of people who are in support groups now are those who tested some years back, before we had the programme as it is, but those who started treatment in the test and treat programme, a lot of them are not in support groups because they dont see the need.\n\nI think a positive is that public health facilities continue providing HIV medication and there are more players tackling HIV, tackling sexual and reproductive health and rights, SRHR, but sadly I think focus on HIV seems to be taking a dead seat, Todhlana said.\n\nAll this, according to her, has been attributed to several reasons amongst them a weak psycho-social support system, a shift in funding which is now more focused on young people and to a certain extent, the emergence of non-communicable diseases that are on the increase.\n\nMany people with HIV are struggling with non-communicable diseases, which are not properly managed, and some non-communicable diseases come with extreme pain. Those sharing their experiences indicate that the pain management approach is almost close to none.\n\nI think this is linked to funding and there is a focus on young people, which is good, especially adolescent girls and young women.\n\nWe have seen an improvement on the PrEP issues, but the realities that we consider as we get into 2025 include sadly that HIV stigma and discrimination persists, the level of domestic funding for health and particularly HIV is worryingly too low, Todhlana, who tested HIV positive in 2003 added.\n\nShe explained further: And the continued focus on young people or the 0-49 age group ignores the effect of HIV successes, which means people are ageing with HIV.\n\nBecause when we celebrate the success, by the way I turned 16 last week and Im already out of the 0-49 age group and I get my treatment from the public health sector and it is very obvious that you are autistic outside, but I see so many people who are even older than me, living with HIV and getting their treatment and then you are left to your own individual and without the proper care and support.\n\nI think the HIV facility used to be linked to a robust psycho-social support system, but a lot of times I see that this is no longer available and also it was still for people who are more than 49.\n\nAccording to Todhlana, her worry is the upkeep of the young adults born with HIV.\n\nI keep worrying about who is looking after them and the language we still use around young people is being reckless. We say Im a 2,000 reckless, but we call, and they are putting themselves in situations where they can get HIV. They are putting themselves at risk, but we forget that there is that cohort of young people who were not reckless.\n\nShe said many of those who were born with HIV or might have got it from breast milk before we know what we know now are quite a big number in our population who are in this cohort.\n\nSo, when I talk of people ageing with HIV, I include these young people. And then people diagnosed in their adulthood, like me, we have more than 20 years of treatment and Im increasing in number.\n\nTodhlana spoke of ART side effects saying a lot of lives were being lost because of less attention and monitoring to those taking ARVs.\n\nOn the packaging of the ARVs, the side effects are written, they are very clearly written there to say your kidneys will be affected, your liver will be affected, you know, a whole lot of organs will be affected so they need to be monitored regularly.\n\nBut I, I think the reason they are not being monitored is because when they were doing the monitoring there was external funding to do that and once the external fund has left, then it is no longer there because our labs are no longer eternally being funded.\n\nShe also raised issues to do with menopause and social isolation issues to those living with HIV.\n\nMenopause is coming much earlier for women with HIV than for those who do not have HIV. Maybe 10 years or so earlier.\n\nAnd then also the social isolation at times. With social isolation, I havent been to church for three years now. Im someone who enjoys going for Sunday services and going for midweek services. I havent been inside a church for the past three years.\n\nI was diagnosed of HIV in 2000, then diagnosis of arthritis in my spine in 2008, that was five years after starting ARVs in 2003. But the ARVs we were taking, were too many, at least three tablets three times a day, compared to one tablet once a day. You see how our researchers continue to improve. Today we have progressed to one tablet every 24 hours.\n\nShe stated that research studies are very important.\n\nClinical research and social research have been very important to the response to HIV. And also Im hoping to see that theres also media doing their research as well, as media, to make sure that they contribute to the body of knowledge that is building on our HIV response, she explained.\n\nTodhlana has a daughter, now at university, born without HIV to a mother living with HIV.\n\nShe gave credit to GALZ for the support given during her most difficult time of life.\n\n",
