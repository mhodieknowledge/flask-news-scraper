            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) says adequate stocks of ZWG notes are available to meet the current trade demands across the key economic sectors.\n\nThe announcements come at a time when the majority of citizens outside the capital of Harare have never felt the texture of the ZWG notes. In provinces such as Bulawayo and the Midlands, up to Beitbridge, traders have resorted to the use of US$ and the South African Rand as change due to the scarcity of ZWG notes.\n\nEven in Harare, citizens continue to struggle to access the local unit in hard cash for transactional purposes. As a result, the ZWG accessibility problems, which characterised the local unit since its launch on April 5 2024 have persisted for more than a year, prompting analysts to blame such a tight grip for the eroding confidence in the currency.\n\nIn a recent statement, RBZ governor Dr John Mushayavanhu said he had noted concerns coming from the transacting public relating to the availability of ZWG cash and its usage, particularly from areas outside Harare.\n\nThe RBZ wishes to advise that usage of the local currency, ZWG, has improved significantly in the economy. Precisely, the proportion of local currency settlements on the National Payment System from ZWG7,86 billion in April 2024 to ZWG56,8 billion (43%) as at May 30 2025. In tandem, the Reserve Bank has been disbursing adequate cash to banks in line with demand.\n\nAs at June 12 2025, the total ZWG deposits in the economy amounted to about ZWG16 billion, of which over ZWG207 million was cash held by banks, which meets optimal requirements and is sufficient to support daily deposits and withdrawals by the public, he said.\n\nMushayavanhu said the central bank is currently working with banking institutions to ensure the wider availability and distribution of ZWG cash through banking halls and Automated Teller Machines (ATMs).\n\nThe prevailing currency and exchange rate stability , coupled with measures being taken by the government to increase the usage of ZWG in the economy is expected to result in increased usage of the local currency in both electronic and physical form, he added.\n\n",

This innovative system utilises advanced technologies such as the Internet of Things (IoT), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and big data analytics to enhance traffic flow, road safety, and transparency, said Muswere.\n\nZimbabwe has lagged behind in addressing traffic violations, with offenders often escaping punishment due to an archaic ticketing system.\n\nHowever, given Zimbabwes ongoing power and internet challenges, there is scepticism over the feasibility of the systems success in the country.\n\nMuswere added that the system would be implemented in phases, starting with Harare and Bulawayo.\n\nThe Home-Grown Traffic Management System will be rolled out in phases, commencing with Harare and Bulawayo, followed by other major towns. To support effective implementation, several key enablers will be monitored, including a robust project governance framework, reliable power sources, stable internet connectivity, and strategic system integration with supporting platforms and institutions.\n\nSpecialised courts will assist in expediting justice delivery as the system operates. This localised approach is expected to foster knowledge transfer, skills development, and national pride while promoting self-reliance and sustainability, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nUgandas President Yoweri Museveni has signed into law an amendment that will allow, once again, civilians to be tried in a military court under certain circumstances.\n\nA previous law permitting such trials was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in January.\n\nBefore that ruling,civilians could be taken to a military tribunal if they had been found with military equipmentlike guns or army uniforms. Activists had complained that the law was used to persecute government critics.\n\nParliamentarians passed the amendment last month amid a heavy police presence and a boycott by opposition lawmakers, who argued that it violated the ruling by the countrys highest court.\n\nIn January, the judges said that the military courts were neither impartial nor competent to exercise judicial functions, the International Society for Human Rights reported at the time.\n\nThe amendment appears to try and address some of the issues.\n\nIt says that those presiding over the tribunals should have relevant legal qualifications and training. It also says that while performing their legal functions they should be independent and impartial.\n\nBut civilians can still be transferred if found with military hardware.\n\nThe law will deal decisively with armed violent criminals, deter the formation of militant political groups that seek to subvert democratic processes, and ensure national security is bound on a firm foundational base. If it aint broke, dont fix it!, army spokespersonCol Chris Magezi wrote on X after the bill was passed by MPs.\n\nBut opposition leader Bobi Wine said the law would be used against him and others.\n\nAll of us in the opposition are being targeted by the act, he told the AFP news agency.\n\nThe Uganda Law Society, a professional body that represents the countrys lawyers, has said it will challenge the constitutionality of the amendment.\n\nFor years, activists had argued that the military courts were being used by the government to silence dissidents, with people alleging that evidence had been planted.\n\nIf you are a political opponent then they will find a way of getting you under the military court and then you know your fate is sealed once there, justice will never visit your door, human rights lawyer Gawaya Tegulle told the BBCs Focus on Africa podcast in February.\n\nHe added that people can spend years in detention on remand as the courts await decisions from senior military figures, which may never come, and those who are tried and found guilty face harsher penalties than in civilian courts.\n\nA recent high-profile case followed Novembers arrest of long-time leading opposition figure Kizza Besigye. He was picked up in neighbouring Kenya, taken across the border and then charged in a military court with possession of pistols and attempting to purchase weapons abroad, which he denied.\n\nThose charges were dropped, and replaced with others, when his case was transferred to a civilian court following the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nMuseveni, who has been in power since 1986,described the verdict as the wrong decision, adding that the country is not governed by the judges. It is governed by the people.\n\nHe hadpreviously defended the use of military courtssaying that they dealt with the rampant activities of criminals and terrorists that were using guns to kill people indiscriminately.\n\nHe said that civilian courts were too busy to handle these gun-wielding criminals quickly.\n\n",
