            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE 14th edition of the Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba ended on a high note Friday with key stakeholders seizing the Mines and Minerals Development Bill as a golden opportunity to end rampant injustices bedeviling the nation.\n\nDespite the Southern Africa nation being endowed with a cocktail of precious minerals, the majority of the populace generally feels that very little benefits from the extractive sector have been of benefit to them.While millions worth of minerals are siphoned from the country, villagers have endured environmental destruction, broken infrastructure and dust inhaling related diseases with no resources to solve the problems.The gazetting of the Mines and Minerals Bill in June this year presented a window of hope to millions of citizens, who have endured decades of being sidelined under the colonial eras Mines Act.But at the 2025 Environmental Social Governance Conference hosted by Silveira House and the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Organisation (ZELO) during the ZAMI, several participants implored the government to expeditiously address all the problems bedeviling the mining sector through the Bill.Silveira House programmes manager, Dr Alois Madhekeni said his organisation as a faith based entity believes in the promulgation of legislation, which places human dignity at the core.That principle is expected to determine the manner in which both corporations and the government conduct their operations. So, in this case as corporations rush into the mining sector, the question is how is the dignity of the human person and that of communities being protected?He emphasised that mining should not leave the communities worse off economically, socially, health-wise, technologically and culturally as he implored the adoption of a rights-based perspective to mining.If we see these values embedded in the Minerals Amendment Bill, then we will be happy. Our role now as Silveira House is to ensure that communities have access to the document, they analyse it and are geared to adequately provide input, added Madhekeni.ZELO emphasised on the need to put in place a strong legal infrastructure as the gateway to sustainable mining activities across the country.The Zimbabwe Council of Churches (ZCC) implored the government and corporates to be guided by the Biblical guidance, which talks about Godly fairness in enjoying the earth and its gifted abundance.However, the Mines and Mining Development Deputy Minister, Polite Kambamura said gazetting of the MMB is a gesture by the government to engage citizens on the contentious matter.It is a show by the government on its commitment to transparency and inclusivity, leaving no one behind. The Bill was prepared to enhance Zimbabwe as a friendly investment destination, which is investor ready .To make sure that community challenges are dealt with once and for all we brought sustainability into the Bill, he said.Kambamura added that the legal instrument responds to the ever-changing global and local environment. It will open up room for the drafting of the mining policy and cover all the issues which speak to mining.\n\nDespite the Southern Africa nation being endowed with a cocktail of precious minerals, the majority of the populace generally feels that very little benefits from the extractive sector have been of benefit to them.\n\nWhile millions worth of minerals are siphoned from the country, villagers have endured environmental destruction, broken infrastructure and dust inhaling related diseases with no resources to solve the problems.The gazetting of the Mines and Minerals Bill in June this year presented a window of hope to millions of citizens, who have endured decades of being sidelined under the colonial eras Mines Act.But at the 2025 Environmental Social Governance Conference hosted by Silveira House and the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Organisation (ZELO) during the ZAMI, several participants implored the government to expeditiously address all the problems bedeviling the mining sector through the Bill.Silveira House programmes manager, Dr Alois Madhekeni said his organisation as a faith based entity believes in the promulgation of legislation, which places human dignity at the core.That principle is expected to determine the manner in which both corporations and the government conduct their operations.

Our country Zimbabwe is, indeed, on a reversible journey towards vision 2030.\n\nThis modern infrastructure serves as a source of pride for the veterans of the liberation struggle, who fought so that all our people can have a higher quality of life, he said.\n\nThe project will provide 300 residential flats and 750 student apartments.\n\nThe project also provided over 3 000 job opportunities benefiting members of the Zvishavane community and others.\n\nThe local community also benefitted from upgraded water and sanitary systems as well as improved road networks following the introduction of the project.\n\nWork resumed in March last year and has been completed.\n\nMnangangwa said project is a symbol of national unity and progress, adding his government will continue pushing towards achieving such high-quality projects countrywide.\n\nThis is the standard and work we must uphold across all our entities.The residential flats are investments in the dignity of our people through quality living space.\n\nMnangagwa also said the success of this project demonstrates the power of private public partnerships, further applauding the PSPF and its partners.\n\nFirst Mutual Wealth provided the land, while the majority of the capital, approximately 97%, was invested by the PSPF, with First Mutual acting as project manager, according to Douglas Hoto, chairman and group chief executive officer of First Mutual Holdings.\n\n",

The water has impurities when it is available. When it is left in containers, the water turns greenish and brownish, which reduces confidence among residents to drink it.\n\nObservations by a lot of residents are that the city water dries their skin, probably due to the treatment chemicals they are using, read the report.\n\nThe plight of Harare residents was further compounded by the local authoritys workers, who embarked on a strike, citing incapacitation and protesting the death of two fellow employees who died in Budiriro.\n\nConsequently, the council could not attend to burst pipes, leaving areas like Mufakose as a ticking health time bomb.\n\nThe report further stated that the state of the roads in Harare is dire, leaving residents to patch up the potholes themselves.\n\nThe majority of the roads in Harares high-density residential suburbs are in bad shape, with potholes everywhere. The situation is better in the low-density areas, where the residents sometimes use their personal resources to do road patching, and council workers put more energy into repairing and maintaining roads leading to the homes of the powerful elites in society.\n\nIn Mbare, residents are disgruntled by the poor state of their streets. Vehicles passing by leave a trail of dust filling their homes. This has forced many households to keep their windows and doors closed most of the time. If not closed, sofas and floors will be covered in dust. Due to the dust, residents now fear contracting diseases, the report read.\n\n",

            "content": "ByAlois Vinga\n\nThe Zimbabwe Investment Development Agency (ZIDA) has expressed concern that local miners are not taking advantage of its Mining Claims Matchmaking platform, despite its vast potential to unlock critical investment opportunities.\n\nThe platform was created to connect mining claim holders in Zimbabwe with both local and international investors. It is designed to facilitate partnerships for technical support, tributary agreements, joint ventures, debt funding, or even the outright sale of mining claims.\n\nAccording to ZIDA, the service is open to all mining claim holders in Zimbabwe, whether individuals, companies, or syndicates, regardless of their scale of operation.\n\nTo use the platform, claim holders are required to upload their identification documents, claim registration certificate, valid inspection certificate, and a site map.\n\nBut speaking during a plenary discussion at the 2025 Environmental Social Governance Conference convened by the Zimbabwe Environmental Law Organisation (ZELO) and Silveira House on the sidelines of the Zimbabwe Alternative Mining Indaba in Bulawayo, the ZIDA Legal Manager, Chidochashe Ncube, said local miners were not tapping into the platforms potential.\n\nThere seems to be a lack of trust by locals who suspect the risk of losing their claims. Locals want to go behind the scenes and the few who come forth only do after being shortchanged by the potential investors.\n\nThe public must be aware that this platform has a number of benefits like assistance in identifying ethical investors, contract drafting and professional advice on business-related issues, she said.\n\nNcube said such platforms also enhance the strengthening of ESG standards since matched parties easily fall under the authorities surveillance.\n\nQuizzed by one David Bote on why ZIDA appears to be pro-foreign investors as opposed to locals in rendering assistance, Ncube dismissed the claims, arguing that locals are not willing to come forth and exhaust available opportunities.\n\nIt is incorrect. The fact of the matter is that foreigners first port of call is usually the ZIDA because they do not know anyone around. In contras,t locals often bypass the Agency, opting to engage their connections instead, only to look for us when this goes off hand, added Ncube.\n\n",
