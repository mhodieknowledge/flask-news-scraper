            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has sentenced Sipho Moyo (20) to 16 years in prison for the brutal killing of a 40-year-old man with an axe and a stone.\n\nIn her ruling, the judge condemned the wave of violent murders linked to Zimbabwes gold panners.Moyo, who was 19 at the time of the crime, was convicted of murder after chasing down the victim at Pinafore Shops in December 2024 and assaulting him with an axe, a stone and booted feet. The victim later died from severe head injuries.Justice Evangelista Kabasa, sitting in Hwange, dismissed Moyos claims of provocation, describing the attack as deliberate and fuelled by revenge.Seeking revenge is a completely different story and has nothing in common with acting in the heat of the moment, she said.Whether the intention was actual or legal is neither here nor there. Murder is murder.The court heard how Moyo pursued the deceased until he caught up with him, struck him with a stone, repeatedly kicked him, and then used an axe that caused fatal injuries.Why would one use an axe on a human being and not expect that person to be fatally wounded? Kabasa asked.In handing down sentence, the judge turned her attention to the mining sectors violence.It appears violence is the language which gold panners speak. It is saddening to note the number of murder cases involving gold panners. You appear not to respect the sanctity of life, she said.While acknowledging Moyos youth as a mitigating factor, the court noted the seriousness of the offence.An axe is never meant to be used on a human being. The assault was vicious, rupturing lung vessels and fracturing the skull. The presumptive penalty, where a weapon has been used, is 20 years imprisonment. We would have imposed 20 years were it not for your youthful age.Moyo will serve 16 years behind bars.\n\nIn her ruling, the judge condemned the wave of violent murders linked to Zimbabwes gold panners.\n\nMoyo, who was 19 at the time of the crime, was convicted of murder after chasing down the victim at Pinafore Shops in December 2024 and assaulting him with an axe, a stone and booted feet.

Their whole conduct showed that they were aware of their unlawful possession.The court said the argument that they were within the 15-day window under section 77 of the Parks and Wildlife Regulations was misplaced because the provision only applies to lawfully acquired ivory.Ignorance of the law is no defence. The belief held by the appellants was not sufficient to cover their conduct with legality, the judgment stated.The judges further noted that the duos decision to travel from Lupane to Bulawayo under the cover of night and Sibandas attempt to run away from police undermined their story.If their possession was lawful, they would have behaved in a completely different way, the court said, adding that the claim of expecting a reward was not reasonably true as the offices concerned do not give out rewards.\n\nThe court ruled that their defence of intending to surrender the tusks was meritless and legally unsustainable.\n\nJustices Rita Makarau Guvava, Susan Makoni, and Felistas Chatukuta recently dismissed the appeal by Hlupani Austin Sibanda and Ellmone Nkomo, who were earlier sentenced by a Bulawayo magistrate to 11 years and 9 years imprisonment respectively for contravening section 82(1) of the Parks and Wildlife (General) Regulations.The pair was arrested in April 2024 carrying a 21.75-kilogram sack of unmarked ivory pieces.According to the court record, Sibanda attempted to flee and only stopped when detectives from the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) Minerals, Flora and Fauna Unit fired a warning shot.In their defence, the men claimed they had picked up the tusks in Lupane while herding cattle and were on their way to surrender them to Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife offices in Bulawayo for a reward.They argued that the law gave them a 15-day grace period to hand over the ivory.But the Supreme Court found their explanation implausible.The appellants did not acquire the ivory lawfully and in turn could not lawfully possess it for registration purposes.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has overturned the 20-year jail term imposed on a Mudzi man, William Smoko, who had been convicted of rape, blasting the lower court for convicting him on speculative, contradictory, and uncorroborated evidence.\n\nIn a recent judgment delivered by judges of appeal, Justices Esther Muremba and Deputy Judge President Munyaradzi Mawadze, the High Court found that the State had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, ruling that the complainants story was riddled with inconsistencies and credibility gaps.I am unable to conclude that the State proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, Muremba ruled.She added that the magistrates analysis fell far short of the rigorous scrutiny required in criminal trials where the liberty of an accused person is at stake.Smoko had been convicted of raping a 34-year-old woman from a neighbouring village following a long-running feud over a faulty cellphone and a missing shovel. The alleged incident was said to have occurred after the woman accused Smoko of cheating her in a phone swap deal and later of stealing gold ore from her husbands artisanal mining venture.But the High Court said these prior disputes cast serious doubt on the complainants motives.These circumstances cast a shadow over her motives and raise legitimate concerns about possible fabrication of the rape allegations, Muremba said.The court described the complainants version as both contradictory and implausible, noting that she claimed Smoko assaulted her in broad daylight, reported him to the police, and yet chose to sleep alone with only a three-year-old child that same night despite fearing his return.The absence of any meaningful explanation for these decisions raises serious doubts about the reliability of her version of events, the judge said.Muremba further criticised the magistrate for relying on unverified assumptions.At no point during the trial did the accused admit to visiting the complainants homestead on the date in question It was therefore incorrect for the learned regional magistrate to conclude that it was common cause that the accused had gone to the complainants homestead.The judge also faulted the State for failing to produce key evidence, including the torn clothing the complainant claimed had been ripped during the alleged assault.The absence of such physical evidence, particularly when its existence is explicitly claimed, significantly undermines the credibility of the complainants testimony, she ruled.On the medical findings, Justice Muremba noted that the report only showed healed hymenal tears inconsistent with a recent sexual assault and that the bruises could not conclusively be linked to the alleged rape.The High Court found that the magistrate had wrongly dismissed the defence evidence, including that of Smokos wife, who testified that her husband was at home on the night of the alleged attack.The courts conclusion that the accuseds wife had placed him at the complainants homestead is speculative and unsupported by the evidence.The court then ruled that the inconsistencies, contradictions, and lack of corroboration rendered the conviction unsafe.A conviction must rest on evidence that is persuasive and free from reasonable doubt.That is not the case here.The liberty of the accused is at stake. The credibility of the complainant must be evaluated in light of all relevant circumstances, including any potential motive to mislead.Smokos conviction and sentence were accordingly set aside.\n\nIn a recent judgment delivered by judges of appeal, Justices Esther Muremba and Deputy Judge President Munyaradzi Mawadze, the High Court found that the State had failed to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, ruling that the complainants story was riddled with inconsistencies and credibility gaps.\n\nI am unable to conclude that the State proved its case beyond reasonable doubt, Muremba ruled.She added that the magistrates analysis fell far short of the rigorous scrutiny required in criminal trials where the liberty of an accused person is at stake.Smoko had been convicted of raping a 34-year-old woman from a neighbouring village following a long-running feud over a faulty cellphone and a missing shovel.
