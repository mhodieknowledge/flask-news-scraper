            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nTHE Zimbabwe Nurses Association (ZINA) has strongly condemned the governments neglect of a Bikita nurse, Progress Muzuva, who was severely injured while on duty seven years ago, calling her case a tragic example of systemic abandonment of front-line health workers.\n\nShe has since been denied compensation, medical support, and justice by the government for which she worked.\n\nIn a statement Tuesday, ZINA president Enock Dongo said Muzuvas case is not an isolated incident and demanded an investigation into the matter.\n\nZINA demands a full investigation into how this matter was handled from the district authorities all the way up to head office.\n\nThose responsible for this neglect must be held accountable. What happened to Nurse Muzuva is not an isolated incident; this is just a drop in the ocean.\n\nAcross Zimbabwe, many nurses are injured while carrying out their duties, some in ambulance accidents while escorting patients, others while lifting immobile patients in wards, Dongo said.\n\nAccording to the nurses association, many health workers get injured on duty and receive no support, treatment, nor compensation.\n\nMany are left to suffer silently in their homes, unable to afford care with the meagre salaries they earn.\n\nThis culture of abandonment is pushing nurses out of the public service and out of the country to search for greener pastures elsewhere.\n\nWe ask again: Who will care for the carers? If the system fails to protect those who risk their lives for patients, then it has failed entirely.\n\nZINA calls on all relevant stakeholders to intervene urgently in Muzuvas case. She must receive immediate medical assistance, financial support, and justice. Her case should set a precedent for change, Dongo added.\n\nMuzuva told this publication that since 2018, the Health Ministry has been refusing to help her from the district level up to the ministers office.\n\nMuzuva was attacked by a violent maternity patientwhom she was escorting to Silveira Hospital in Masvingo for emergency care.\n\nThe violent patient wanted to kill herself and her newborn baby in what medical experts say could have been a case of severe postpartum psychosis.\n\nMuzuva saved the patient and her newly born baby but injured her spine and leg in the process.\n\n",

How does a stone sculpture park help encourage environmental conservation?\n\nIn Harare, Zimbabwes capital, the Chapungu Sculpture Garden offers a unique fusion of art and environmentalconservation. The park is a sanctuary where sculptors carve stone works of art inspired byanimalsand other natural forms. It, in turn is designed to protectnature. Indigenous native species have been planted there to help preserve them. Artist and park manager Nicholas Kadzungura explains that they are threatened bydeforestation. The garden, founded in 1970 and named after the sacred Bateleur Eagle, serves as both a creative hub and a living classroom, where visitors learn aboutZimbabwes rich ecological and cultural heritage.\n\nMany sculptures in the park reflect Zimbabwes environmental challenges. Friend of the Rhino, a piece by the late Joseph Ndandarika, which encourages empathy and the protection ofendangered species. With only around 600 black rhinos left in Zimbabwe, the message is pressing. Marcey Mushore, the parks director, explains how animistic Shona traditions guide conservation efforts. The park also acts as agreen lungfor Hararesurban sprawl. Some 2.4 million people live in its metropolitan area and pollution and disappearing green spaces are a problem.\n\nChapungus artists are committed to sharing ancestral knowledge through sculpture workshops and educational programs. Kadzungura stresses that Zimbabwes traditional stone art is not just decorativeit carries lessons about coexistence with nature. Asclimate changeand urban development threaten the countrys wetlands andbiodiversity, the parks mission is becoming more vital. Chapungu inspires action by blending creativity, tradition, and environmental stewardship.\n\n",
