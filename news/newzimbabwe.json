I will get there, Im not a speaker I dont make noise, I am cool)\n\nFurther, the gifted artist used a powerful wordplay to address a contentious issue, which saw him being elbowed out of Harare International Conference Centre (HICC) by Zanu PF acolyte, Kudakwashe Tagwirei ostensibly to pave way for a church event.\n\nNdabva paJabhuna (HICC) horaiti chiitai, musandipe tuma notes handina teacher ini, ndapfuura 40 handidi teacher ini, ndosasa nezvandada handina firita (I left HICC its fine do your own, dont give me notes I dont have a teacher, I passed 40 I dont want a teacher, I say what I like I dont filter), he went on.\n\nZanu PF activists and spendthrifts, Wicknell Chivayo and Passion Java were not spared the lyrical attacks.\n\nIn 2020, Passion Java attempted to lure Winky D with a US$35 000 contract which the latter refused to accept.\n\nWinky D also referenced ongoing tender scandals involving Zanu PF member Mike Chimombe and his associate Moses Mpofu, adding a layer of commentary on the current state of the music industry.\n\nHamusi Mapofu (Mpofu) mbudzi yadzoswa (Winky) buritsai Mic (Chimombe), sang Winky, loosely translated to mean You are not blind, the goat has been brought back release the mic.\n\nAdditionally, Winky D responded to Seh Calaz for accusing him of sidelining him at shows.\n\nThe free music concert showcased an impressive lineup of artists, including Master H, Aleck Macheso, Saintfloew, Da Ruler, Silent Killer, and Nisha T, but it was Winky D who juggled the Mbare audience.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com has invited Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner atMadzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal)to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, this week we want to discuss corporate rescue, what it is and when it is necessary.\n\nVM: Before defining what corporate rescue is and its purpose, it is necessary to contextualize it in light of the general business operating environment in Zimbabwe. We have witnessed a lot of major businesses applying to be placed in corporate rescue of late.\n\nThis is a result of the limited access to affordable finance for businesses which are expected to remain innovative against the novel, fluid informal sector which operates with little to no recurrent fixed costs like wages, statutory obligations and rentals.\n\nIt is common knowledge that at the heart of every business, guaranteeing its very survival, is the businesss ability to manage cashflow. A failure to manage cashflow can ultimately affect the very existence of the business due to financial distress.\n\nCorporate rescue, previously known as judicial management, is intended to literally rescue businesses that face collapse by placing a moratorium on legal actions against the company from creditors, restructuring the companys liabilities, debts, affairs and property with the purpose of returning it to being a viable concern.\n\nThe overarching purpose is to ensure that the business remains viable and open, employees remain at work and creditors are paid the whole or an agreed part of what they are owed.\n\nIt is probably the last line of defence for a business against collapse.\n\nReporter:When is a company considered financially distressedincorporate rescue proceedings?\n\nVM: A company is financially distressed when it cannot pay its debts when they become due in the normal course of business or when it is likely to be insolvent within 6 months. Key indicators may be negative cashflow, possibly from the company being owed significantly under long-term arrangements while itself being burdened by short term loans that have become due.\n\nWhat is critical in the analysis of financial distress from a corporate rescue perspective is that the company has a realistic prospect of recovery if it is placed in corporate rescue, it has a positive net worth, with assets that are more valuable than liabilities or that if managed properly, the assets are capable of paying off the liabilities and returning the business to a viable competitive state.\n\nReporter: What is the procedure to place a company incorporaterescue?\n\nVM: Our law allows for directors of a company to pass a resolution to put the company in corporate rescue if the directors are of the view that the company is financially distressed and there are reasonable prospects of rescuing the company.\n\nAlternatively, an affected person, such as a creditor or even an employee can apply to the court to have the company placed under corporate rescue if they can demonstrate that the company is distressed and there are reasonable prospects of the company being rescued from that distress.\n\nReporter: What is the effect of corporate rescue on stakeholders?\n\nVM: Once an order has been issued to place the company in corporate rescue, a corporate rescue practitioner takes over the management of the company. He or she will develop a rescue plan which includes the restructuring of the debts and operations of the company including its implementation plan if approved by stakeholders.\n\nThe most significant development is that a moratorium is imposed on all legal proceedings against the company allowing the company breathing spaceto operationalize its rescue plan.\n\nLong and short, the creditors ability or rights to sue or enforce their judgments or court orders against the company are suspended. Their only option is to participate in the development of the rescue plan and in some instances, they will have to compromise on the quantum of the debts meaning agreeing to a haircut of what they are owed. This in some situations is their only guarantee that the debts are repaid.\n\nOn the other hand, the employees contracts remain in force and employee claims of unpaid wages are a priority. The powers of directors are significantly curtailed as they have to report to the corporate rescue practitioner and assist him or her in bringing back the company to viability.\n\nThe rights of the shareholders are preserved, however, their interest in the company may be affected by the restructuring and its consequences to the remaining value of the company. The positive is that after a successful rescue, they will still have a company to talk of. The alternative is having no company without corporate rescue.\n\nReporter: Can an interested person object to a company being placed in corporate rescue and what will the grounds be?\n\nVM: Any affected party, creditors, employees, shareholders or any stakeholder can object to a company being placed in corporate rescue. The common objection is that the company is attempting to use corporate rescue in bad faith for purposes of circumventing its obligation to pay debts that have become due.\n\nHowever, stakeholders may have different reasons for objecting to a rescue plan, for instance, if employees feel that their rights or claims are not adequately addressed, creditors feel that the rescue plan will not likely succeed but result in them having to wait too long for only a fraction of their debtet cetera.\n\nOther reasons may be the questionable capacity of the rescue practitioner to revive the company, an unviable rescue plan or that the company has no prospect of rescue.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima we will continue on insolvency next week but we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

The move entails a five year freeze or insignificant payment of pension gratuities with the government saving millions of dollars.\n\nHe said the move may also disadvantage some workers who may die before reaching the age of 70 as their benefits would be significantly reduced.\n\nThe ZCTU called upon the government to revisit the reform, respect senior citizens and focus on tenets that bring direct and improved benefits to its employees and pensioners instead of crafting slave policies to wriggle out of its responsibilities.\n\n",

Congolese army spokesman General Sylvain Ekenge told journalists his countrys armed forces were working to push back the enemy.\n\nRwanda is determined to seize the city of Goma, he said. The DRC announced it was pulling its diplomats from Kigali in a letter to Rwandas embassy in Kinshasa.\n\nUN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed fears on Thursday that the fighting could aggravate the risk of a regional war.\n\nSince the beginning of January, about 400,000 people have been forced to flee the fighting. The UN has begun evacuating non-essential staff from Goma to neighbouring Uganda and to the Congolese capital Kinshasa.\n\nThe African Union urged all parties to preserve the lives of civilians.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nCITIZENS Coalitions for Change (CCC) Welshman Ncube faction has condemned the violence that ensued at a legislators funeral in Glen View South over the weekend.\n\nThe attacks occured during the funeral of CCC Glen View South Member of Parliament Grandmore Hakata (56), who died last week due to diabetes complications.\n\nMDC-T leader, Douglas Mwonzoras vehicle was allegedly damaged whilst a member of his political party, Preston Mwabaya, was seriously injured in the skirmishes and is reportedly admitted in the lntensive Care Unit (ICU) at a local hospital.\n\nScreengrab from a video circulating showing CCC youths heckling Mwonzora as he leaves the funeral venue\n\nIn a statement this Sunday, CCC Ncube faction spokesperson Willias Madzimure condemned the violence, accusing former CCC leader Nelson Chamisa of causing the mayhem.\n\nThe Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) condemns in the strongest terms the violence that erupted at the funeral of our beloved member, Hon. Hakata, who was a loyal member of the CCC led by Prof. Welshman Ncube. Hon Hakata had stood firm in his principles and refused to resign from Parliament when ordered to do so by Hon Nelson Chamisa.\n\nWe are deeply disturbed by the actions of certain individuals who sought to disrupt the peaceful proceedings and cause harm to innocent mourners.\n\nAmong those who were attacked and harassed by the perpetrators were Hon. Matsunga, Hon. P. Chitimbe, Hon. Musarurwa, and Hon. Madzimure, all of whom were present to pay their respects to the deceased.\n\nWe are disappointed that Hon. Nelson Chamisa, when he addressed his supporters and the mourners, failed to condemn the violence. As a leader, it is imperative to promote peace and stability, and we expect more from those who aspire to lead our nation, Madzimure said.\n\nHe said his party was outraged by the attack on Senator Mwonzora, the president of MDC-T party, and the damage to his vehicle and called on law enforcement agents to deal with perpetrators.\n\nThis blatant display of thuggery and intimidation is a clear indication of the lack of leadership and accountability within Hon Nelson Chamisas camp.\n\nAs a party, we value the principles of peace, tolerance, and respect for human life. We urge all our supporters and members to remain calm and peaceful, even in the face of provocation.\n\nWe call upon the authorities to investigate the violence and bring the perpetrators to justice. We also urge all Zimbabweans to promote a culture of peace, tolerance, and respect for human life, added Madzimure.\n\nAccording to witnesses and opposition members who attended the funeral, some of the youths involved in the attacks were visibly drunk.\n\n",

A total 77 councillors voted.\n\nPresidential aspirants Phillemon Machana, Twine Phiri, Marshal Gore and Makwinji Phiri fell by the wayside in embarrassing fashion, all gathering less than 10 votes each.\n\nOne of the front-runners before the election, Martin Kweza withdrew his candidature just before the election citing personal reasons although it later turned out he had been selected for another plum post as board member at the Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation (ZBC).\n\nHereunder is the full list of the new ZIFA board;\n\nPresident  Nqobile Magwizi\n\nVice President Loveness Mukura\n\nVice President  Kenny Ndebele\n\nBoard members;\n\nAlice Zeure\n\nTafadzwa Benza\n\nDavison Muchena\n\nThomas Marambanyika\n\nBrighton Ushendibaba\n\nKudzai Kadzombe.\n\n",
