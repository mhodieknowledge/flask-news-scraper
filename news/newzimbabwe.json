            "content": "NBC News\n\nPriscilla Presleys former business partners accused the rock widow of hastening daughter Lisa Maries death to secure her own spot atop Elvis massive financial kingdom, according to a bombshell lawsuit filed in Los Angeles this week.\n\nPlaintiffs Brigitte Kruse and Kevin Fialko accused Priscilla Presley, the former wife of Elvis Presley, of fraud, breach of contract and other civil misdeeds in a Los Angeles County Superior Court action entered on Monday.\n\nElvis Presley is the King of Rock n Roll,' the lawsuit says. Defendant Priscilla Presley always wanted to the Queen. In fact, despite flaunting a public persona that only wanted to protect and keep her family together, Priscilla ultimately wanted one thing, power, no matter the cost.\n\nPriscilla Presleys attorney Marty Singer disputed the allegations in a two-page statement Thursday.\n\nThis is without a doubt, one of the most shameful, ridiculous, salacious and meritless lawsuits I have seen in my practice, Singer said in a 648-word statement.\n\nThese fabricated claims have absolutely no validity and we are confident this case will be dismissed.\n\nKruse, an auctioneer who specialized in Elvis sales, and Fialko, an Elvis memorabilia collector, said they had been collaborating with Priscilla Presley for years to leverage her name for maximum profits.\n\nBut once Kruse and Fialko got her back on stable financial footing in November 2023, they allege, she abruptly cut ties with them and denied themcompensation from themoviePriscilla.\n\nEarlier that year, the defendants daughter, Lisa Marie, died atage 54.\n\nLisa Marie had been ailing, but Priscilla insisted they attend a Golden Globes event together on Jan. 10 as Priscilla clasped to the spotlight, the lawsuit said.\n\nLisa Marie had collapsed at herhome days earlier and diedofsmall bowel obstruction, the medical examiners office ruled.\n\nPriscilla rushed to West Hills Hospital and despite Lisas clear directive to prolong her life, Priscilla pulled the plug within hours of Lisa being admitted, according to the lawsuit.\n\nPriscilla knew that Lisas death neutralized the threat of Lisas efforts to have Priscilla removed as the sole trustee of Lisas irrevocable life insurance trust and Priscilla ultimately wanted to control the Promenade Trust and Graceland. At her house the week following (before Lisas funeral), Priscilla exclaimed, Im the queen, Im in charge of Graceland. Kruse and Fialko were heartbroken by the unsettling behavior.\n\nSinger, Priscilla Presleys lawyer, said his clients granddaughter Riley Keough stands behind her grandmother 100%.\n\nKeough is equally disgusted with this latest, vicious attempt by Kruse to attempt to ruin her grandmothers life, Singer said.\n\nA rep forKeough, Lisa Maries daughter andPriscillas granddaughter, could not immediately be reached for comment Thursday.\n\nElvis and Priscilla Presleywere married for six years and divorced in 1973, four years before Elvis died.\n\nPriscilla Presley is now 80, and Elvis was 42 when he died onAug. 16, 1977, at Graceland.\n\n",

            "content": "TRT Global\n\nCecil the lionwas the face of Zimbabwes Hwange National Park,had his own Wikipedia page, and a GPS collar tracked by Oxford researchers.\n\nTourists would fly to Zimbabwe just to photograph him. He was, in every possible way, the king of the pride.\n\nThen one evening in July 2015, a wealthy American trophy hunters bow and arrow ended it all.\n\nCecils killing blew up on social media, sparking protests from London to Los Angeles and turning him into the posthumous mascot of a campaign against trophy hunting.\n\nA decade on, lions and other wildlife continue to die the same way every year. Just that they dont make it to the headlines like Cecil did.\n\nAugust 10 marksWorld Lion Day, which Dr Angie Elwin, head of research at World Animal Protection, calls a stark reminder that the king of the jungle remains unprotected from commercial exploitation through trophy hunting and captive breeding.\n\nThere are over 8,000 lions in South Africas captive breeding sites, while only 3,500 roam in the wild according to IUCN. /Photo: Blood Lions\n\nProduction line\n\nThe growth of South Africas captive breeding industry over the past 30 years reflects how skewed conservation priorities have become.\n\nThe country now has nearly 8,000 lions in captivity, more than double the 3,500 in the wild.\n\nWorldwide, only about 20,000 lions remain outside of captive breeding centres, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature.\n\nMost lion farms are pretty intensive production lines, Dr Louise de Waal, director of the conservation campaign Blood Lions, tells TRT Afrika.\n\nIn the wild, lioness gives birth once every two years. In captivity, she would potentially have four to five litters during the same period.\n\nCubs are separated from their mothers within days or weeks. Then, as Elwin points out, they are monetised at every stage of life: from cub petting attractions to walking with lions experiences.\n\nOnce too large to handle, a captive-bred lion is invariably sold as a target in a canned hunt, or commercialised killing of trophy animals within enclosed spaces, from where escape is impossible. Its a blood sport that represents the worst of human indulgences.\n\nEven death doesnt end the lions humiliating torment.\n\nSkins, skulls and paws become trophies, while bones may be dried, boxed, and sometimes illegally traded for use in the international big cat bone trade, Elwin tells TRT Afrika.\n\nHunters hang the heads and skins on their walls.\n\nBan only in name\n\nSouth Africa banned the legal export of lion skeletons in 2019, but a recent World Animal Protection investigation revealed that illegal trade continues.\n\nBetween 2014 and 2024, the CITES trade database shows that over 12,600 lion parts and products were exported globally  9,629 trophies, 943 claws, 670 skeletons, 486 skulls, 252 bones, skin, teeth, and other body parts.\n\nThis isnt conservation; its a supply chain built on animal suffering, with no benefit to wild populations and devastating consequences for the species welfare and dignity, says Elwin. Ending this cycle is critical to both protecting lions and safeguarding South Africas reputation as a global leader in ethical, wildlife-based tourism.\n\nCecil as a catalyst\n\nOn the positive side, Cecils death did change something.\n\nBased on available data, global trade in lion trophies has dropped by about a third since 2015, down to fewer than 1,000 in recent years.\n\nBut trophy hunting continues for elephants, rhinos, leopards, and other animals.\n\nConservationists in South Africa estimate that the proposed levy could generate over US$175 million annually. /Photo: World Animal Protection\n\nIn 2023, more than 6,000 international hunters killed over 34,000 animals, according to the Professional Hunters Association.\n\nThis is despite the fact that most local populations oppose trophy hunting. Communities living near South Africas Kruger National Park demand alternatives to killing animals for money despite having to deal with poverty, unemployment and wildlife that threatens their livestock and crops.\n\nFinding another way\n\nOver 85% of people we surveyed were in support of introducing a lion levy on international tourists, intended to replace trophy hunting revenue and directly benefit local communities, says Elwin, among those who contributed to the Lion Levy Research Paper.\n\nAbout 70% disagreed that hunting wild animals has always been part of our culture, and we should keep doing it.\n\nConservationists estimate that the levy, if introduced, could bring in over US $175 million annually, enough to replace all trophy hunting income in South Africa without scaring off tourists.\n\nThe lion levy has strong potential to improve local community livelihoods, Elwin tells TRT Afrika.\n\nCommunities near parks like Kruger have other options, too. They can sell traditional handicrafts to tourists, manage wildlife areas and guide eco-tours.\n\nCommunity-run lodges, campsites and guided tours would also attract responsible travellers seeking authentic nature experiences, Elwin says. This helps create jobs and raise revenue linked directly to wildlife preservation.\n\nCommunities around South Africas Kruger National Park prefer wildlife-friendly revenue as opposed to trophy hunting income which only benefits operators of the captive-breeding sites. /Photo: World Animal Protection.\n\nSome communities are trying out virtual safaris and wildlife webcams for international audiences, making money with minimal environmental impact. A few have leased out land to conservation groups, while others are part of biodiversity conservation campaigns that guarantee remuneration.\n\nBy embracing these diverse, wildlife-friendly livelihood options, communities can build sustainable economies that support conservation goals, reduce illegal hunting, and improve overall well-being, explains Elwin.\n\nFor now, its a race against time to shift from exploitation to preservation, before the roar of the wild potentially fades into silence.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nIts coming home!  a phrase indelibly linked to English football fans  has now gained currency among some Zambians in the battle over what to do with the body of former President Edgar Lungu.\n\nThe 68-year-old died two months ago in South Africa where he was being treated for an undisclosed illness.\n\nIn the latest episode of what is now a full-blown saga, a Pretoria court ruled in the Zambian governments favour, saying that in the public interest, Lungus remains can be repatriated and given a state funeral, against the wishes of the family.\n\nThe decision triggered celebrations among some governing party supporters, who shared Facebook posts with the phrase: Its coming home, as if Zambia had won a trophy.\n\nAn undignified response, perhaps, but it has come to symbolise how divisive and partisan this has become.\n\nFor some, who are fed up with the row, the sorrow and grief that came with Lungus passing have faded into feelings of fatigue.\n\nBut despite a host of more pressing economic problems, public discussions continue to be dominated by the fallout from the death of the former president, who led the country for six years from 2015.\n\nThe seeds of the controversy were sown in the feud between Lungu and his successor  the man who soundly beat him in the 2021 election  Hakainde Hichilema. But it has now spiralled into a row laced with wild accusations of witchcraft.\n\nWhen the judge in South Africa made his ruling last week, the ensuing anger from Lungus older sister was telling.\n\nBertha Lungu burst into a fit of rage, crying uncontrollably as she hurled unsavoury words at Zambias Attorney General Mulilo Kabesha, who was also present in court.\n\nKabesha, Lungu is not your fathers son hes not Hakaindes son This is really painful. I dont want to go to Zambia, she cried as people, including her niece, Tasila Lungu, struggled to comfort her and cover her mouth.\n\nThe body has not yet been repatriated to Zambia because the Lungu family is appealing against the South African judges decision  a case that is due to be heard on Friday.\n\nThis was all supposed to have been settled in June, when the family initially agreed that there could be a state funeral in Zambia. But the plans were scuppered over a dispute about what role President Hichilema would play.\n\nLungus family said one of his dying wishes was that Hichilema should not go anywhere near his body.\n\nThe key to understanding the animosity was the more than 100 days that Hichilema, opposition leader at the time, spent in detention in 2017, awaiting trial on treason charges.\n\nHe was accused of endangering the life of then-President Lungu after his motorcade allegedly refused to give way to the one transporting the head of state.\n\nThe charges were only dropped after the intervention of the secretary general of the Commonwealth. This was one of several times that Hichilema was arrested while he was in the opposition.\n\nIn turn, the Lungus have alleged persecution under Hichilema. Tasila and the former presidents widow, Esther, continue to face corruptions charges, which they deny.\n\nLungus family have vowed that they are prepared to wait for the court process as long as it takes to ensure he receives a burial they consider dignified, even if it means stalling the process, according to their spokesperson Makebi Zulu.\n\nThey insist that while they were open to burying Lungu in Zambia, they want to honour his wishes that Hichilema should not attend the event.\n\nBut the authorities are adamant that the former president should be accorded a state funeral to be attended by his successor and given a proper send-off as a former president.\n\nThe government, through the attorney general, has even indicated Lungu may have to be buried without the familys involvement.\n\nIf they want to set a precedent, let them give us reasons why the current president should not go near the casket. And who has told them that he wants to be near the casket, anyway? he told the state broadcaster ZNBC.\n\nWe are ready as government to discuss with the family, we will never ignore the family unless the family just walks out but the family has a right to say: We are not coming, we are not part of it. Then we will proceed and bury without them.\n\nTraditionally, all ex-leaders have been accorded state funerals and buried at Embassy Park, which is specifically reserved for them.\n\nSishuwa Sishuwa, a Zambian historian and senior lecturer at South Africas Stellenbosch University, strongly disagrees with the idea that Lungu could be buried without his familys involvement.\n\nSuch reckless statements are culturally insensitive, undermine the governments claims that its actions are motivated by the desire to accord Lungu a dignified burial, and indicate that political considerations rather than public interest are the key drivers at play, he told the BBC.\n\nThe failure by Hichilema to rein in on the unruly conduct of his officials and supporters has fed public perception that the president approves of such conduct and consequently heightened divisions.\n\nHe argues that had Hichilema publicly indicated that he would stay away from the funeral, Lungu would have been buried long ago.\n\nDr Sishuwa says that the authorities determination to take the body of Lungu from the grieving family  in the name of giving him a dignified funeral  has not only worsened political divisions but has also fed the belief that the body may be wanted for occult reasons, in a country where thebelief in witchcraft is widespread.\n\nNevers Mumba, the leader of the Movement for Multiparty Democracy, which is in a political alliance with Hichilemas party, has defended the president.\n\nWhat drives [the president] is not obsession, but a deep, deep sense of duty. Hakainde Hichilema never gives up on anything he pursues as long as he believes he is doing the right thing, Mumba, who is also a pastor, wrote on his Facebook page.\n\nHe fights, with a clear conscience till the end, and he keeps on refining his methods until he gets it right.\n\nHow long this fight will go on for is not known, but several episodes of the saga are yet to be written.\n\nZambians may shrug and try to focus on other matters, but they will still get drawn into the debate about whether the body should come home.\n\n",

Plaintiff is legally represented and should be advised on what steps to take to enforce his rights granted by an order of Court.\n\nThe judge also noted that Musara was seeking to have custody of the children awarded to Motsi, making it more appropriate for the Canadian Court to deal with the issue of the maintenance of the minor children.\n\nDismissing the case, Justice Maxwell advised Musara that if Motsi is unnecessarily dragging the process there should be ways in which he can have that matter dismissed by the Canadian Court Once that is done, he can then properly approach this Court.\n\nThe special plea was upheld, effectively halting the Zimbabwe proceedings.\n\n",
