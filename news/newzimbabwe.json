Justice Pisirayi Kwenda ruled that the pair was facing a serious offence, which can result in their imprisonment for 20 years if convicted.\n\nOn Friday, Mpofus lawyer Advocate Tapson Dzvetero submitted that the two deserved bail considering that their co-accuseds from the local authority were granted bail.\n\nChimombe and Mpofu argued that this development constituted changed circumstances, considering the courts revised perspective on their prior bail request.\n\nAshiel Mugiya representing Chimombe concurred.\n\nMabhaudhi argued this had no relevance to the bail circumstances for the accused.\n\nThe granting of bail to city council officials has no bearing on the bail of these accused persons, Mabhaudhi said.\n\nAccording to the State, in January, the CoH initiated a project to rehabilitate streetlights in preparation for the SADC summit hosted by Zimbabwe in August.\n\nThe council invited bids, receiving submissions from 11 companies, including Juluka Endo Joint Venture (Pvt) Ltd, co-owned by Moses Mpofu.\n\nThe tender invitation specified that all bidders must provide stamped audited financial statements from the last two years.\n\nAdditionally, proof of payment for special procurement oversight committee and administration fees were required.\n\nOn April 19, an evaluation committee awarded contracts to four companies across eight lots for the street light rehabilitation project.\n\nMpofus company did not meet the requirements as its audited statements lacked an audit opinion, a crucial criterion for eligibility.\n\nNonetheless, the council invited Mpofus company to submit a new bid, which it did, presenting a document that allegedly contained false information. Mpofu is accused of misrepresenting his companys compliance with the regulatory requirements.\n\nMpofu allegedly submitted a bid security obtained on March 26 that had previously been used for an unsuccessful tender.\n\nHe is also accused of submitting audit documents purportedly prepared by three consultancy firms, which the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) found to be unregistered.\n\nIt is alleged that Mpofus company was awarded the contract, with the State claiming that Chimombe signed as a witness, leading to the duo receiving a partial payment of US$260,000.\n\n",

            "content": "By Associated Press\n\nWASHINGTON  The Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld the federal law banning TikTok beginning Sunday unless its sold by its China-based parent company, holding that the risk to national security posed by its ties to China overcomes concerns about limiting speech by the app or its 170 million users in the United States.\n\nA sale does not appear imminent and, although experts have said the app will not disappear from existing users phones once the law takes effect, new users wont be able to download it and updates wont be available. That will eventually render the app unworkable, the Justice Department has said in court filings.\n\nThe decision came against the backdrop of unusual political agitation by President-elect Donald Trump, who vowed that he could negotiate a solution, and the administration of President Joe Biden, which has signaled it wont enforce the law  which was passed with overwhelming bipartisan support  beginning Sunday, his final full day in office.\n\nTikTok should remain available to Americans, but simply under American ownership or other ownership that addresses the national security concerns identified by Congress in developing this law, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement, noting that actions to implement the law will fall to the new administration.\n\nTrump, mindful of TikToks popularity, and his own 14.7 million followers on the app, finds himself on the opposite side of the argument from prominent Senate Republicans who fault TikToks Chinese owner for not finding a buyer before now. Trump said in a Truth Social post shortly before the decision was issued that TikTok was among the topics in his conversation Friday with Chinese leader Xi Jinping.\n\nTikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew, who is expected to attend Trumps inauguration, used the app to thank the incoming president for his commitment to work with us to keep TikTok available.\n\nIts unclear what options are open to Trump, a Republican, once he is sworn in as president on Monday. The law allowed for a 90-day pause in the restrictions on the app if there had been progress toward a sale before it took effect. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who defended the law at the Supreme Court for the Democratic Biden administration, told the justices last week that its uncertain whether the prospect of a sale once the law is in effect could trigger a 90-day respite for TikTok.\n\nThe decision explores the intersection of the First Amendment and national security concerns in the fast-changing realm of social media, and the justices acknowledged in their opinion that the new terrain has been difficult to navigate given they know relatively little about it.\n\nCongress has determined that divestiture is necessary to address its well-supported national security concerns regarding TikToks data collection practices and relationship with a foreign adversary, the court said in an unsigned opinion, adding that the law does not violate petitioners First Amendment rights.\n\nJustices Sonia Sotomayor and Neil Gorsuch filed short separate opinions noting some reservations about the courts decision but going along with the outcome.\n\nWithout doubt, the remedy Congress and the President chose here is dramatic, Gorsuch wrote. Still, he said he was persuaded by the argument that China could get access to vast troves of personal information about tens of millions of Americans.\n\nSome digital rights groups slammed the courts ruling shortly after it was released.\n\nTodays unprecedented decision upholding the TikTok ban harms the free expression of hundreds of millions of TikTok users in this country and around the world, said Kate Ruane, a director at the Washington-based Center for Democracy & Technology, which has supported TikToks challenge to the federal law.\n\nContent creators who opposed the law also worried about the effect on their business if TikTok shuts down.\n\nIm very, very concerned about whats going to happen over the next couple weeks, said Desiree Hill, owner of Crowns Corner mechanic shop in Conyers, Georgia. And very scared about the decrease that Im going to have in reaching customers and worried Im going to potentially lose my business in the next six months.\n\nAt arguments, the justices were told by a lawyer for TikTok and ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese technology company that is its parent, how difficult it would be to consummate a deal, especially since Chinese law restricts the sale of the proprietary algorithm that has made the social media platform wildly successful.\n\nThe app allows users to watch hundreds of videos in about half an hour because some are only a few seconds long, according to a lawsuit filed last year by Kentucky complaining that TikTok is designed to be addictive and harms kids mental health. Similar suits were filed by more than a dozen states. TikTok has called the claims inaccurate.\n\nThe dispute over TikToks ties to China has come to embody the geopolitical competition between Washington and Beijing.\n\nByteDance and its Chinese Communist masters had nine months to sell TikTok before the Sunday deadline, Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X. The very fact that Communist China refuses to permit its sale reveals exactly what TikTok is: a communist spy app. The Supreme Court correctly rejected TikToks lies and propaganda masquerading as legal arguments.\n\nThe U.S. has said its concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way thats difficult to detect.\n\nTikTok points out the U.S. has not presented evidence that China has attempted to manipulate content on its U.S. platform or gather American user data through TikTok.\n\nBiden signed the legislation it into law in April. The law was the culmination of a yearslong saga in Washington over TikTok, which the government sees as a national security threat.\n\nTikTok, which sued the government last year over the law, has long denied it could be used as a tool of Beijing. A three-judge panel made up of two Republican appointees and a Democratic appointee unanimously upheld the law in December, prompting TikToks quick appeal to the Supreme Court.\n\nWithout a sale to an approved buyer, the law bars app stores operated by Apple, Google and others from offering TikTok beginning on Sunday. Internet hosting services also will be prohibited from hosting TikTok.\n\nByteDance has said it wont sell. But some investors have been eyeing it, including Trumps former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt. McCourts Project Liberty initiative has said it and its unnamed partners have presented a proposal to ByteDance to acquire TikToks U.S. assets. The consortium, which includes Shark Tank host Kevin OLeary, did not disclose the financial terms of the offer.\n\nMcCourt, in a statement following the ruling, said his group was ready to work with the company and President Trump to complete a deal.Prelogar told the justices last week that having the law take effect might be just the jolt ByteDance needs to reconsider its position.\n\n",

Although we have previously had similar experiences in the same corridor over the past few years, including on the Mozambican side, this has been worse than any wash away we have seen before.\n\nThe NRZ confirmed that there were dispatched wagons carrying ballast and quarry fines from the Nalatale Quarry Mine in Shangani en route to the affected areas.\n\nFortunately, there have been no injuries reported among staff or damage to rolling stock due to the washouts.\n\n",

The situation has escalated after the announcement of extension of the presidential term of office until 2030 or 2033.\n\nCCC elements residing or working in the United Kingdom, United States of America, South Africa, among other jurisdictions, and believed to be at the forefront of social media onslaughts against Mnangagwas plan to extend his presidency beyond 2028 are also under the radar.\n\nMamwadhu revealed that staunch CCC activists Greatman Makipa, Clive Biggie Nyaketa, Nobukhosi Dube, Brian Chikukwa, Munyaradzi Zengeni, Evelyn Chigaro, Kevin Dube, Memory Kishindo, Xolisani Masuku, Melody Phylis Magejo, and Sibongile Sibanda, who have been labelled as fugitives by the Zimbabwean government have vowed to push for a return of democracy to the southern African nation.\n\nIt is actually shameless to target economic and political refugees. The Government of Zimbabwes actions underscore the deteriorating human rights situation at home.\n\nActivists are branded as threats to national security, and state apparatuses such as the police and judiciary are weaponized to suppress dissent.\n\nBack home, Mwamadhu said the crackdown on locally-based activists such as former Mkoba Member of Parliament (MP), Amos Chibaya, violates Zimbabwes commitments to observing international law while weaponizing local legislation.\n\nMnangagwa and his Zanu PF are using the laws such as the Patriotic Bill, Cyber Security Act and Maintenance of Public Order Act (MOPA) to silence the opposition and human rights activists in the country.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nHIGH Court judge, Justice Tawanda Chitapi has reserved to Thursday, his judgement in a matter Yadah Stars founder Walter Magaya is challenging his disqualification to contest as Zimbabwe Football Association (ZIFA) president.\n\nThe cleric-cum-sportsman took Zifa to court after he was disqualified arguing that he was illegally removed from the list.\n\nThis Friday, parties met before Chitapi, with Magayas lawyer Advocate Thabani Mpofu arguing that the decision by the ZIFA ethics committee should be reversed.\n\nThe lawyer also said the ethics committee acted in an abnormal manner which bordered on corruption.\n\nMpofu said their case was simple and carried weight.\n\nWhat brings us to court is a simple and very straightforward issue. The requirement set out in the ZIFA Constitution is clear, it says O Level or an equivalent qualification.\n\nIf a qualification issued by a university is even better than O Level, on that, this application ought to succeed, Mpofu said.\n\nMagaya submitted a diploma from the University of South Africa (UNISA).\n\nThe respondents show that they are alive to a fact that they have to give reasons for the disqualification. But what they have not done is to give reasons to say that the documents they received do not amount to a qualification.\n\nWhat the Constitution establishes is a minimum requirement. The tariff in the statute is a minimum qualification.\n\nThe Electoral Code envisages the candidates may fail to meet requirements by failing to produce certain documentsand when they fail, they dont get disqualified, Mpofu submitted.\n\nMpofu also said Magaya failed to produce an O Level certificate, and this does not mean he doesnt have that certificate.\n\nHe said the ZIFA Constitution says a candidate should be given seven days to do so.\n\nIt gives you time within which to comply. Should there be a dispute on what a candidate would have given them, it will be a time to contest that.\n\nMpofu said none of the respondents have the powers to disqualify prospective candidates.\n\nWe challenge the respondents to identify a provision that allow them to disqualify a candidate, he said.\n\nMpofu said his client had a chat with Lincoln Mutasa, ZIFA normalisation committee chairperson who told him that the issue of qualifications was not the reason they disqualified him.\n\nHe said his client will challenge Mutasa to dispute that.\n\nWhere is Mutasas rebuttal. Where is his affidavit to say this was not the reason why they disqualify him..the decision has to be reviewed and set aside, Mpofu said.\n\nProfessor Lovemore Madhuku representing ZIFA argued that Magayas application was not properly before the court.\n\nThe decisions of the respondent are not reviewable by this court. We dont know the basis on which we as ZIFA we are being brought to court, he said.\n\nMadhuku argued that ZIFA is a non-profit organisation and is not an administrative organisation.\n\nIt is nothing else, it is a private organisation and the law is very clear that you can only review disputes of administrative authorities.\n\nYou should simply strike off this application for not meeting the requirements of the court.\n\nDuring the hearing Chitapi said ZIFA was supposed to bring a record of proceedings, which culminated in Magayas disqualification.\n\nIf that record exist it should be brought before the court to ascertain who took that decision. Without the record there is nothing to talk about. The rules say that they have a duty to ensure that the record should be made available.\n\nThe issue is the law says there should be that record, the submissions should speak on the action which was taken, Chitapi said.\n\n",
