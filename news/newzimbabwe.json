Drivers are reminded to be law-abiding citizens and collectively contribute towards road safety.\n\nSimilar traffic monitoring systems have been adopted by various countries, including Morocco, Rwanda, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, France, and Germany.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTanganda Tea Company has won a US$41,816 claim against businessman Darlington Matsitukwa following a protracted legal battle dating back to 2018.\n\nMatsitukwa was refusing to pay the amount in foreign currency, arguing that the company waived its right to get the money in foreign currency by initially accepting ZW$5,876 he paid towards settling the debt.\n\nHe also argued that the 2019 legal changes in payment of foreign debts changed everything and he was entitled to pay the amount in local cuurency.\n\nHowever, High Court judge Justice Faith Mushure ruled in favour of Tanganda Tea Company, ruling that Matsitukwa should pay US$41,816.\n\nMushure said the beneficiary of a statutory right is at liberty to waive such an entitlement conferred by the law for his or her benefit.\n\nThe provision is essentially an exception clause to the general position that contractual obligations valued in USD immediately before the effective date, that is February 22 2019, were to be paid in RTGS dollars at parity or at a one-as-to-one rate.\n\nOnce a debt satisfies the jurisdictional facts that establish a foreign obligation, such a debt, by operation of the law, is excluded from the ambit of s133 of 2019, she said.\n\nWhile the court observed that it would be commercially unacceptable to attempt to settle any foreign loan or obligation in local currency, it also issued a critical rider that the parties involved may mutually agree to settle the foreign loan or obligation in local currency.\n\nIt is clear in my view that when the appellants allegedly waived their rights, they were not aware of the rights and legal implications. It took the hearing and the decision of this court to identify and confirm the rights.\n\nIn the present matter, the plaintiff cannot approbate and reprobate in relation to the repayment of the initial ZW$5,876 in local currency, said the judge.\n\nThe judge said the amount was deducted from the capital sum and cannot be repaid in foreign currency again due to plaintiffs initial acceptance of the same.\n\nIn the final analysis, it is my finding that the claim partly succeeds.\n\nThe principle of a waiver does not apply as a defence to the repayment of the outstanding US$41,616. The facts do not establish the existence of a tacit agreement between the parties in this regard.\n\nThe court then declared the debt of US$47,493 as a foreign obligation.\n\nUS$5,876 was deducted from the amount and Matsitukwa was ordered to liquidate the judgment debt of US$41,616.\n\nTanganda Tea Company was ordered to restitute Matsitukwa the ZW$41,616 he paid.\n\nThe background is that in January 2018 Tanganda Tea company and Matsitukwa entered into an agreement in which the company was to sell tea products worth US$47.493 to the latter for resale in Malawi.\n\nMatsitukwa was given the products but did not pay.\n\nThe company then sued him in a mattter that was heard by the High Court and only ZW$5,876 was recovered.\n\nMatsitukwa then made two separate payments of ZW$16,000 and ZW$25,717 to the Trust Account of Tanganda Tea Companys lawyers, thereby extinguishing the debt before 22 November 2019.\n\nTanganda then refused to accept the payments insisting that it was a foreign debt and should have been settled in USD.\n\nThe parties then agreed that that indeed the debt is a foreign debt and should have been paid in USD.\n\nThe point of departure is whether the initial payment in ZWL and its acceptance extinguished the obligation to pay the debt in USD.\n\nMatsitukwa argued that Tanganda Tea Company waived its right to have payment of its debt in USD.\n\nHe argued that following the issuance of the judgement under HC10306/18, a writ of execution was duly issued, resulting in ZWL5,876 being realised from him.\n\nHe further argued that in trying to recover the outstanding balance, the company issued summons for civil imprisonment against him.\n\nMatsitukwa urged the court to note the deduction of the ZWL payment from the principal sum of US$47,483 by the company leaving thebalance at USD$41,616 which it claimed in the summons for civil imprisonment under HC6686/19.\n\n",

I also get ready for mountain climbing by pitching a tent in the Drakensberg and Lesotho mountain ranges, and hiking by myself. In addition, I coach various individuals, who reached the Everest Base Camp and Kilimanjaro. This keeps me active, said Harripersadh.\n\nHe said his love for mountaineering started later in life because he did not have the funds to pursue his interest.\n\nI came from a poor home and took full responsibility for taking care of my family. When I turned 60, I realised I could do something for myself and that is when I chose mountain climbing. It was not easy but I have always been fit. My family was active. My father fought in WWII. I used to work in construction before I retired at 65, so Im healthy. I dont smoke or drink and am always on the move.\n\nHe said mountain climbing was not a cheap hobby.\n\nEven though I love mountain climbing, it is expensive, especially if you climb in other countries. The flights, gear and training adds up, so I look for sponsors most times. Ive decided to make Mount Kilimanjaro, which will be my last climb, is because its the only affordable one.\n\nThe grandfather of five said he loved nature, which was what was kept him going.\n\nNature is different. Its interesting and exploring the unknown has always been my passion. Im sad that I dont have people my age climbing with me. The oldest is usually 36 and when they see an older man like me, they tend to have an attitude because they think I will hold them back. However, they quickly realise I can handle myself. I dont get altitude sickness and thankfully, I have no illnesses so there is nothing that holds me back.\n\nHe said his wife, Navi (71), used to join him before she hurt her knee. He now travels alone.\n\nMy wife, who Ive been married to for 56 years, used to hike Drakensbergs mountains with me but had to stop after her surgery. Now I do everything alone. Even when I am climbing mountains in other countries, I will find a reputable company to take me. I hop on the flight on my own, get there, do my climb and then return home. Im used to doing the adventures on my own now.\n\nHarripersadh said this mountain climb would be his last.\n\nMy family, which includes my 4 children, have told me that I need to stop now. They want me to take a break and rest. I also feel it is my time to retire from mountain climbing. I did all I wanted and now I should enjoy the memories I have made, said Harripersadh.\n\n",

            "content": "By Xinhua\n\nA CHINA-aided agricultural demonstration village was officially launched last week in the Shamva District of Mashonaland Central Province, Zimbabwe, to enhance agricultural productivity among rural farmers.\n\nThe demonstration village, the second of its kind set up by a Chinese agricultural expert group in the southern African country, draws inspiration from Chinas experience in poverty alleviation and aims to assist local farmers in transitioning from subsistence farming to a business-oriented approach.Dozens of households are gaining hands-on experience in sustainable farming through advanced irrigation systems, high-yielding drought-resistant seed varieties, precision farming techniques to optimize output, and integrated livestock-crop systems, according to the expert group.Speaking at the launching ceremony of the demonstration village attended by Chinese and Zimbabwean officials and local villagers, Zimbabwean Deputy Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water, and Rural Development Vangelis Haritatos said the demonstration village highlights the shared vision for agricultural transformation between the two countries.Part of the demonstration villageThis project is a testament to the enduring friendship and strategic partnership between Zimbabwe and the Peoples Republic of China, rooted in mutual respect, shared prosperity, and a common vision for sustainable development, he said, adding that capacitating rural farmers is critical for rural revitalization efforts and ensuring community development in the face of climate change.The strategic importance of this demonstration village is that this project is not just another agricultural venture; it is a living laboratory of innovation, a bridge between traditional knowledge and modern technology, and a testament to South-South cooperation, said Haritatos.On his part, Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Zhou Ding said the initiative deeply resonates with Chinas remarkable journey of development and poverty alleviation.We fully recognize that with over 60 percent of Zimbabwes population living in rural areas, it is essential to support the rural residents, especially those from marginalized and disadvantaged communities, in breaking the chains of poverty and unlocking their full potential, said Zhou.Beyond farming, the demonstration village also incorporates agro-processing facilities to add value and reduce post-harvest losses, training centers for skills transfer, renewable energy solutions, solar-powered cold storage, and processing units.Nomalisa Zindi, one of the beneficiaries, said the initiative has been pivotal in transforming subsistence farming into small businesses and creating self-sustainability.We are no longer begging or asking for something, but we are doing it for ourselves, knowing that we are working on something that will give us money for our pockets and the money to keep the project going, she said.\n\nThe demonstration village, the second of its kind set up by a Chinese agricultural expert group in the southern African country, draws inspiration from Chinas experience in poverty alleviation and aims to assist local farmers in transitioning from subsistence farming to a business-oriented approach.\n\nDozens of households are gaining hands-on experience in sustainable farming through advanced irrigation systems, high-yielding drought-resistant seed varieties, precision farming techniques to optimize output, and integrated livestock-crop systems, according to the expert group.Speaking at the launching ceremony of the demonstration village attended by Chinese and Zimbabwean officials and local villagers, Zimbabwean Deputy Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water, and Rural Development Vangelis Haritatos said the demonstration village highlights the shared vision for agricultural transformation between the two countries.Part of the demonstration villageThis project is a testament to the enduring friendship and strategic partnership between Zimbabwe and the Peoples Republic of China, rooted in mutual respect, shared prosperity, and a common vision for sustainable development, he said, adding that capacitating rural farmers is critical for rural revitalization efforts and ensuring community development in the face of climate change.The strategic importance of this demonstration village is that this project is not just another agricultural venture;
