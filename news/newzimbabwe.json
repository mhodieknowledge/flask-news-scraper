He denies the accusation.Museveni said he is seeking reelection to grow the country to a $500 billion economy in the next five years. Ugandas GDP currently stands at about $66 billion, according to the finance ministry.The country will hold its presidential election next January, when voters will also elect lawmakers.Musevenis closest opponent will be pop star-turned-politician Bobi Wine who came second in the last presidential election in 2021 and has already confirmed his intention to run in 2026.Wine, whose real name is Robert Kyagulanyi, rejected the 2021 results, saying his victory had been stolen through ballot stuffing, intimidation by security forces and other irregularities.Reporting by Elias Biryabarema; Editing by Susan Fenton.\n\nIn a post on the X platform late on Saturday Museveni said he had expressed my interest in running for the position of presidential flag bearer, for his ruling National Resistance Movement (NRM) party.\n\nThe 80-year-old has been ruler of Uganda since 1986 when he seized power after leading a five-year guerrilla war.The ruling party has changed the constitution twice in the past to allow Museveni to extend his rule, and rights activists have accused him of using security forces and patronage to maintain his grip on power.

            "content": "By lOL\n\nTHE Proteas assumed control of the first Test on the second day in Bulawayo, despite a marvellous century from Zimbabwean veteran Sean Williams at the Queens Sports Club.\n\nWilliams 137 was the mainstay of Zimbabwes 251 after the Proteas declared on their overnight 418/9.The 38-year-old battled through the initial new-ball onslaught after debutant Codi Yusuf picked up his maiden Test wicket in his first over before following it up with another a couple of overs later.Kwena Maphaka may not have tasted success, but the teenager built up a good head of steam. The teenager struck Brian Bennet flush on the helmet, which forced the Zimbabwean opener to retire hurt with concussion on 19. Prince Masvaure was the concussion substitute.Maphaka also struck Williams with a searing bouncer, but the veteran brushed it off to continue his fine innings.The left-hander was much more fluent against the spin of Keshav Maharaj, often skipping down the pitch to dispatch the Proteas stand-in skipper over midwicket.His celebration upon reaching three-figures was particularly special with Williams screaming in delight and punching the air.Unfortunately for Williams, and Zimbabwe, he did not have much support apart from skipper Craig Ervines 36 with allrounder Wiaan Mulder running through the middle-order with figures of 4/50.Ervine was Maharajs 200th Test victim.Maharaj had the last laugh, though, with the wily left-arm spinner flummoxing Williams with a well-flight delivery. With Williams stretching forward, and missing the delivery, it proved Proteas wicket-keeper Kyle Verreynne to whip off the bails in a flash to bring about the end of a wonderful innings by the hometown hero.Yusuf chipped in with a further wicket towards the end before Maharal also picked up his third of the innings as Zimbabwe were bowled out for 251  a deficit of 167.The Proteas innings once again started poorly with Matthew Breetzke edging Tanaka Chivanga early on, but Tony de Zorzi and Mulder ensured there were no more further alarms as the Proteas built their lead to 216 runs by stumps.First Test, Day 2, StumpsSouth Africa: 418/9 & 49/1 (De Zorzi 22*, Mulder 25*, Chivanga 1/18)Zimbabwe: 251 (Williams 137, Mulder 4/50, Yusuf 3/42, Maharaj 3/70)South Africa lead by 216 runs.\n\nWilliams 137 was the mainstay of Zimbabwes 251 after the Proteas declared on their overnight 418/9.\n\nThe 38-year-old battled through the initial new-ball onslaught after debutant Codi Yusuf picked up his maiden Test wicket in his first over before following it up with another a couple of overs later.Kwena Maphaka may not have tasted success, but the teenager built up a good head of steam.

In an apparent sign of a shake-up backstage, the schedule was changed last-minute, according to the original lineup, Enzo Ishall was supposed to close the show early Sunday morning.\n\nNasha Ts, who had been expected to perform earlier, was slotted in at midnight. The Zimdancehall musician appeared to have forced her way onstage, with faint sound, delays and technical mishap, frustrating Tinashe Mutarisi, who was visibly irritated and animated onstage.\n\nThe backstage politics, delays, and chaotic organisation marred the concert. However, gloss could not be taken way from Freeman, Master H, and Killer T, who delivered solid performances.\n\nOnce the performances got underway, numbers gradually grew at the HICC, a significant reason for the young musicians to hold their heads high as they dared to challenge their limits.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nAS government works towards reducing road lawlessness and carnage, the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) has partnered various government departments to develop a comprehensive Electronic Traffic Management System (ETMS).\n\nResponding to questions raised by the Transport and Infrastructure Development Parliamentary Portfolio Committee members last week, Home Affairs Secretary, Ambassador Tayerera Faranisi said the Zimbabwe National Roads Authority (ZINARA), Central Vehicle Registry (CVR) and Vehicle Examination Department (VED) were working towards a more extensive and and integrated approach for a fully functional smart Electronic Traffic Management System.\n\nThe new system, approved by Cabinet and to be initially be funded by Mutapa Investment Fund is being designed by TelOne and Harare Institute of Technology (HIT), and is expected in phases, to be implemented in Harares 20 sites before being taken to Bulawayo with an initial 15 sites by end of year.\n\nThe system, once in place, will make road traffic offenders pay heavily in order to respect road regulations.\n\nAmbassador Faranisi said the system will rack in US$400 million per year once fully functional.\n\nThe smart policing rollout is being implemented in phases and will focus on two major cities ( Harare and Bulawayo).\n\nThe ZRP will not totally disregard traditional ways of crime prevention and traffic enforcement. Night roadblocks and motorised patrols will continue to be carried out throughout the country including highways, said the Home Affairs secretary.\n\nAmong most targeted offenders are pirate taxis colloquially known as mushikashikas, commuter omnibuses and conventional buses, which are causing mayhem in the countrys cities and towns resulting in fatal road accidents.\n\nAlso, the system will target members of the public who cross the streets without following road traffic lights (robots) or pedestrian crossings (jaywalking)\n\nJaywalking will attract a fine, according to Ambassador Faranisi.\n\nDue to the complexity of the system, the police cannot sorely rely on ZINARA or VID infrastructure.\n\nCurrently, the ZRP is leveraging on ZINARA database to track vehicle owners whose vehicles are captured on cameras flouting road rules and regulations in Harare and Bulawayo Central Business Districts (CBD), Faranisi told the committee chaired MP Tawanda Karikoga.\n\n",
