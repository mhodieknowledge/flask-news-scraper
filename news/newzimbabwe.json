            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nA CHINESE national, presented as an investor within the gold mining sector, has been convicted for stealing over US$875,000 worth of the precious metal from a local small-scale miner and illegally operating in Mashonaland Easts Makaha area.\n\nDocuments from the Mines Ministry, sourced by NewZimbabwe.com, and a Mutoko Regional Magistrates Court ruling have all exposed a well-coordinated syndicate comprising Zheng Zhangxian, the Chinese investor and a mines official, amongst others.\n\nZheng, who was convicted and had his questionably registered company, Reajin Enterprises, receive a restitution order of US$875,667.67, is reported to have been encroaching on a claim belonging to Emmanuel Ndemeras Koodoo 83 claim for the past four years.\n\nReajin Enterprises had been operating as Takura Mining Syndicate, which held a Special Grant, in some form of partnership with a Zimbabwean partner, Vengai Kurarama.\n\nTakura Mining Syndicates claim was next to Ndemeras, from which they knowingly stole his gold ore.\n\nZheng, up until this year, had been mining 75 metres below the surface of Ndemeras claim where he is said to have stolen over 5,000 tonnes of gold ore.\n\nDocuments in NewZimbabwe.coms possession reveal successful investigations into Zhengs operations and payment of a US$350 bribe to Mines Ministry Inspector Anthony Singende, who has since been dismissed.\n\nSingende, who was part of the ministrys investigating team that provided evidence of blasting and Zhengs ore theft on Ndemeras claim, was not only paid to curtail investigations but went as far as sanctioning continued blasting on the property against ministry guidelines. His criminal case is being pursued at the Marondera Magistrates Court.\n\nThe traverse survey clearly indicates encroachment of a haulage in Adit No. 5 along strike with stoping (active extraction of ore) done above the distance of approximately 75 metres.\n\nWe recommend that Takura Mining Syndicate cease mining operations within the boundary of Ndemera and construct a containment wall 6m inside their own boundary, read a report that followed investigations.\n\nThe 6m is mandated by Statutory Instrument (SI) 109 of 1990 (Mine Management and Safety Regulations).\n\nThe ore was processed at the Chinese-owned Zhangveng Milling Plant according to a letter sent to Ndemera by Provincial Mining Director Tendai Kashiri. The milling plant, together with Zhengs own partnership, was last month exposed to have been operating illegally in the country.\n\nWhereas foreign investors are supposed to be cleared by the Zimbabwe Investments Development Agency (ZIDA), legally bound to form and register companies, the two formed mining syndicates with locals against policies meant to govern foreign investments.\n\nReajin Enterprises was convicted on September 8, this year, of contravening Section 113(1)(a) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act as read with Section 379 of the Mines and Minerals Act (theft of gold ore).\n\nA fine of US$3,000 was imposed, restitution of US$875,667.67 ordered and the entire ore dump was to be returned to Ndemera.\n\n",

            "content": "AFP\n\nThis was the work station for the women, who say their trade turned perilous after US President Donald Trump abruptly cut foreign health aid earlier this year.\n\nOne of them, Sharon Mukakanhanga, reached into her bag and pulled out a pair of baby socks she used when there was nothing else between her and risk.\n\nThese little socks served as condoms when I became so desperate after the American government withdrew its support from my all-time go-to safe haven, the 43-year-old told AFP, referring to her preferred clinic.\n\nMukakanhanga is among thousands of sex workers in Zimbabwe who have struggled to access HIV prevention tools since the US cuts gutted centres that once provided free condoms, antiretrovirals and basic care.\n\nFor nearly two decades, the US programmes including PEPFAR, the worlds largest HIV initiative, formed a critical safety net for Zimbabwes fragile health system.\n\nThe first half of 2025 has seen 5,932 AIDS-related deaths, a rise from 5,712 in the same period last year, according to official government figures.\n\nThe impact of the withdrawals was immediate, said 47-year-old HIV-positive sex worker Cecilia Ruzvidzo.\n\nIt was a very difficult period. I literally lost my mind, said the mother of four who has been in the trade for nearly two decades.\n\nShe recalled leaving her most recent visit to the clinic with only 10 days worth of antiretrovirals.\n\nI could not get condoms, which are a necessity for my work. I was at risk of contracting more infections. My clients were also exposed, she said quickly.\n\nWith US-funded facilities shuttered or empty, the few remaining providers say they are buckling under the pressure.\n\nMedical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF), which operates independently of US government funding, said its clinics in Harare suburbs like Epworth and Mbare were stretched thin.\n\nThey dont know where to go. They dont know where to seek services, said project lead Charlotte Pignon, referring to patients and especially sex workers.\n\nWhile she did not directly link the rising deaths to the funding cuts, she said the impact of the withdrawal could not be ignored.\n\nIt is difficult to know all the factors that are impacting those numbers but its impossible to say that its not impacted by the US cuts either, she said.\n\nThe scale of the fallout was still coming into focus, said Wonder Mufunda, chief executive of the Harare-headquartered think-tank Centre for Humanitarian Analytics (CHA).\n\nMufunda said US support had previously amounted to about $522 million, with roughly $90 million directed to HIV programmes.\n\nYou wake up and you have lost such funding, there were serious disruptions, he said, warning that deaths could rise.\n\nIts quite a big blow we are talking about, he told AFP.\n\nBeyond overstretched clinics, Zimbabwes economic freefall is pushing more people into sex work with an estimated 40,500 women already engaged in sex work nationwide, according to CHA.\n\nCompetition had eroded the power to insist on safer sex, said 20-year-old Cleopatra Katsande. Some workers were charging as little as 50 US cents per client, far less than the cost of a box of condoms, she said.\n\nFor veteran Ruzvidzo, there was no real choice.\n\nWe knew it wasnt safe, she said of using baby socks as condoms. But I had to feed my children.\n\nThe clients did not seem to mind, she said. When it comes to this moment, men dont think straight.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nCIVIC society organisation, the Economic Justice for Women Project (EJWP), has petitioned Parliament over the privatisation of water in the countrys local authorities and is lobbying for a bill that regulates its access.\n\nThe Ministry of Local Government is working with the Harare City Council and Helcraw to install pre-paid meters in the capital, with the system also being rolled out to other local authorities.\n\nThe move has been slammed by residents organisations, which say this is tantamount to the takeover of the city councils mandate by private entities.\n\nEJWP programs lead, Tanyaradzwa Jura, said the move disenfranchises women as it contravenes Section 77 of the Constitution.\n\nThis decision risks undermining constitutional rights and increasing social inequalities, particularly gender inequality, whilst compromising public health. The privatisation of water aligns with neo-liberal policy frameworks that emphasise profit at the expense of equity and accountability.\n\nThe government is trusting market forces over human rights and it is likely a reflection of governments challenge to protect its people and defend equal access to a basic public good. This directly contravenes Section 77 of Zimbabwes Constitution, which guarantees every citizen the right to safe, clean, and potable water, said Jura.\n\nAs of last month, the government indicated that 15,000 households had been fitted with smart meters as part of the pilot project.\n\nHarare City Council has been struggling to provide water, with some areas receiving it only two days a week.\n\nEJWP is lobbying Parliament to stop the privatisation of water and introduce a Water Justice Bill which they say will ensure equal access to communities.\n\nToday, EJWP and representatives of its members are submitting a petition to parliament and a policy brief to respective critical stakeholders in this regard demanding that:\n\nParliament halts water privatisation and passes a Water Justice Bill to enshrine public ownership.\n\nGovernment invests in public and community-managed water systems instead of outsourcing to profit-driven private companies.\n\nA gendered human rights impact assessment is conducted before any water sector reforms are rolled out.\n\nCommunities, especially women and marginalised groups, are meaningfully consulted and included in water governance, said Jura.\n\n",

            "content": "Post Independent\n\nLike many asylum seekers, immigrants and refugees, Shayna Oosthuysens childhood was split between two worlds  the wild beauty of Southern Africa and the disorienting unknown of a new life in America.\n\nThe Rifle-based artist was raised on a multi-generational family farm in Zimbabwe. With no fences separating her home from the wild African bush, Oosthuysen spent her childhood immersed in nature and building fairy gardens from rocks, flowers and shells in her familys sprawling yard.\n\nWe lived on a farm where there are no fences or anything, and theres just African bush, Oosthuysen said. My mom had these gardens of flowers and rocks and vines and huge trees and a lot of my childhood was spent down, deep in the garden.\n\n(My mom) was always creating or painting and embracing her own creative world, Oosthuysen said, explaining how her mother would use unique canvases like ostrich eggs. Im a lot like her and so she just inspires me\n\nBut in 2006, a changing political climate in Zimbabwe forced Oosthuysens family to seek asylum in the United States. At just 11 years old, she was uprooted from the only world she had ever known.\n\nWe lost everything pretty traumatically, Oosthuysen said. Six months later, we came to the U.S. with a suitcase and started entirely from scratch.\n\nCaught between her identity in Africa and her new life in America, Oosthuysen struggled to adjust. Assimilation was difficult. She was bullied for her accent and eventually worked to shed it.\n\nIm really thankful to be here and we have a lot of opportunities that we otherwise would never have had, Oosthuysen said. But immigration, no matter where you go or immigrate from or to, its just really, really hard.\n\nThroughout the transition, art became her compass. As a teenager, Oosthuysen used her canvases like visual diaries full of vibrant colors and abstract swirls, each piece captured feelings she couldnt always put into words. Today, free-form paintings remain a way for Oosthuysen, who was recently diagnosed with autism, to express emotions she cant verbalize.\n\nThough her creative pursuits have come in waves throughout adulthood, Oosthuysen made a life-changing decision in June: she quit her job to pursue art full time.\n\nGetting my art out there has been something Ive been wanting to do for 10 years, Oosthuysen said. There are always better artists, but then, I was just like, why not?\n\nShe launched her art under the name Flame Lily Works, inspired by Zimbabwes national flower. The flame lily is more than a symbol of home to Oosthuysen  its a metaphor for resilience.\n\nIt actually looks like a flame and its very beautiful, but its also known to be able to grow in some really harsh environments and be able to bloom through drought and things like that,Oosthuysen said. I love flowers, they are one of my most favorite things, but also its one thing that connects me to where Im from, and then I feel like its very symbolic of me as a person.\n\nIn recent months, Oosthuysen has sold her work at markets in Rifle and Carbondale and launched an Etsy shop under the nameFlameLilyFairy.\n\nFor Oosthuysen, art is more than just a passion its a way of connecting back to the child she once was and the home in Zimbabwe she abruptly lost.\n\nMy art now mostly is for little Shayna  that little gal who grew up in the bush and had all these different kinds of wild African animals around her and her family, Oosthuysen said. Its my way of connecting back to her and for her.\n\nHer artwork full of color, whimsy and the childlike sense of wonder that accompanied Oosthuysen during her adventures in the Zimbabwe bush  is for anyone who needs a little extra sparkle in their life.\n\nOosthuysens work is also a celebration of neurodivergence. She hopes to build a sense of belonging and community with other neurodivergent people through her abstract, emotive paintings in a collection titled All Brains Are Beautiful\n\nIts nerve wracking, being a neurodivergent person, Oosthuysen said. It takes a lot of energy for me to get (to markets), but once Im there, its really cool to be able to see people find joy or be inspired by my art.\n\nThats really rewarding  to share it with the world knowing that the right people will find it who need it, she added. Thats the part that I really enjoy.\n\n",

She also conveyed greetings from Vincent Minja, the President of the Tanzania Chamber of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture (TCCIA).\n\nAmbassador Kaganda emphasized the critical role of the Port of Dar es Salaam in facilitating regional trade. She highlighted that the port plays a vital part in the transportation of vehicles from Japan to Zimbabwe, a factor that prompted the Tanzania Ports Authority (TPA) to open an office in Zimbabwe to streamline shipping procedures.\n\nOn his part, Christopher Mugaga expressed gratitude to the Tanzanian leaders for the ongoing cooperation and underscored the importance of increasing visits, meetings, and business forums to further boost trade and investment growth between the two countries.\n\nMugaga also announced that ZNCC is ready to organize and bring a delegation of Zimbabwean businesspeople to Tanzania in June 2026, where they will engage with their counterparts from TCCIA and explore various investment opportunities available in Tanzania.\n\nThese discussions have laid a solid foundation for economic cooperation between Tanzania and Zimbabwe. It is also anticipated that prior to the Africa-Nordic Foreign Ministers Meeting scheduled for October 2025 in Victoria Falls, Zimbabwe, leaders from TCCIA and ZNCC will convene again for in-depth talks aimed at promoting trade and investment for the mutual benefit of both nations.\n\n",
