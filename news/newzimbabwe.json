            "content": "IOL\n\nThe Department of Home Affairs in South Africa has introduced new technologies at the countrys borders ahead of the Easter weekend.\n\nThis was after Minister Leon Schreiber last week unveiled drone fleets and body-worn camera technology that would be rolled out by the Border Management Authority (BMA), in a bid to combat corruption and secure the borders.\n\nSchreiber announced that the department launched four advanced aerial vehicles, commonly known as drones, and 40 body-worn cameras.\n\nThese newly introduced technologies are expected to be deployed for the first time over the Easter weekend.\n\nSouth Africa shares borders with countries such as Lesotho, Botswana, Swaziland, Mozambique, Namibia and Zimbabwe.\n\nHowever, the countrys borders have faced numerous challenges, including illegal migration, cross-border crime and slow border crossings.\n\nThese issues are exacerbated by porous borders, corruption and inadequate infrastructure with cross-border crime includes illicit trade, smuggling and human trafficking.\n\nAllegations of corruption, police misconduct and collusion between law enforcement and criminal groups are also frequent. In November 2022, six police officers in Limpopo were arrested for accepting bribes to create a safe passage for smugglers to enter the country illegally, while in possession of illicit cigarettes.\n\nThe 2019 report conducted by the Transnational Alliance to Combat Illicit Trade (TRACIT) found that although the country has made considerable strides in economic and social development since the mid-1990s, it still faces a number of challenges, including a significant threat from illicit trade.\n\nFrom smuggling, counterfeiting and tax evasion, to illegal mining and the trafficking of humans and wildlife, illicit trade holds back South Africas economic and social progress. Every year, rampant illicit trade robs Africa and South Africa in particular of massive amounts of capital critical to ensuring economic development and improving living conditions for citizens. The report also cited that some of the problems can be attributed to the many, long and porous borders with multiple country entry points.\n\nIn 2023, TRACIT reported that the South African Revenue Service (Sars) estimated that illicit trade cost the countrys economy R100 billion every year.\n\nThe organisation Undoing Tax Abuse (Outa), which is part of the newly formed Border Management and Immigration Anti-Corruption Forum (BMIACF), welcomed the use of drone technology and body-worn cameras, saying not enough has been done to curb the porous borders and import and export challenges, which have placed enormous pressure on the countrys limited resources as well as lost taxes and excise duties from illicit trade and product importation.\n\nWe believe that if these initiatives are successful, more funds should be allocated to protect South Africa from these losses and challenges incurred accordingly, said CEO Wayne Duvenage.\n\nAccording to the department, the drones are equipped with advanced night vision cameras, including thermal detection technology.\n\nThey can travel at speeds up to 43 kilometres per hour and are capable of operating in remote rural areas, without GPS and even underground.\n\nThe drones launch within 15 seconds, are durable and waterproof, and capable of operating under all weather conditions, says the department.\n\nSchreiber said the BMA is undertaking world-class training to equip eight officers to become expert drone pilots. He said the officers would operate the devices on a shift-basis, and would move around different ports in the country.\n\nAdditionally, following a successful operational partnership over the festive season, the BMA will again partner with the Department of Rural Development and Land Reform, which will avail five more drones to the BMA during the Easter period, Schreiber said.\n\nBetween July 2024 and April 2025, the department dismissed 33 officials for various offences, including fraud, corruption and sexual misconduct.\n\nThis followed a series of internal investigations and forms part of a broader effort to restore integrity within the institution.\n\nThe department said 19 officials are facing prosecution while eight have already been convicted and sentenced to prison terms ranging from four to 18 years.\n\nSchreiber added that the body-worn cameras would be fitted to officials working in the port environment to detect and punish acts of corruption, while also monitoring the efficiency of officials.\n\n",

These assertions are both inaccurate and misleading, the bloc said, adding that the SADC Mission in the DRC (SAMIDRC) has not participated in any joint operations as claimed.\n\nSADC noted that SAMIDRC is currently implementing a structured and coordinated withdrawal from the DRC in line with directives from the SADC Summit of Heads of State and Government. The bloc had announced the end of the deployment in March.\n\nSADC also reaffirmed its commitment to the outcomes of a consultative meeting held on March 28, 2025, in Goma, eastern DRC, between SADC representatives and M23 leadership.\n\nThe statement said that SADC remains dedicated to supporting peaceful and diplomatic efforts aimed at achieving lasting stability in eastern DRC. All parties have been urged by the SADC secretariat to act responsibly, refrain from the spread of misinformation, and work collectively to de-escalate tensions and restore peace in the region.\n\nEastern DRC has endured decades of conflict, with armed groups including M23 vying for control of the mineral-rich region. The violence has displaced millions and deepened an ongoing humanitarian crisis.\n\nSAMIDRC, which includes troops from Malawi, South Africa, and Tanzania, was deployed in December 2023 as part of regional efforts to support peace processes and bolster security in collaboration with Congolese authorities.\n\n",
