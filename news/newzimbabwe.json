One migrant openly admitted to crossing illegally, stating, Im not afraid to say this. Im crossing illegally here because theres no immigration or whatever. You cant stop someone suffering.\n\nFor those who make it across, the challenges only multiply. Shelters near the border, such as one for women and children, are filled with stories of despair. Some migrants, like a 14-year-old girl trafficked into South Africa, endure harrowing journeys. They passed through people who were robbing others. Some were taken away, and some were raped, she recounted.\n\nThe situation for men isnt any better. Many travel to Johannesburg only to find themselves trapped in poverty and forced into hijacked buildings. These decrepit structures are rife with overcrowding, inadequate sanitation, and the ever-present threat of fire.\n\nOne resident remarked, Youd rather be in this hijacked building than back home in Zimbabwe. Theres nothing to go back to.\n\nThe migration crisis has fueled xenophobic sentiment across South Africa. Movements like Operation Dudula have gained traction, calling for the mass deportation of undocumented immigrants.\n\nCritics argue that undocumented migrants are straining public resources and competing for jobs in an already struggling economy. Yet, human rights advocates, such as attorney Nomzamo Zondo, call for a more constructive approach.\n\nOnce you are here, how do we make sure that you are regularised, that we know who you are, and that you contribute to this economy? Zondo questioned. She warned against policies driven by hate and exclusion, urging the government to address systemic issues instead of scapegoating migrants.\n\nThe lack of border enforcement, compounded by South Africas flawed immigration system, leaves migrants in a perpetual cycle of vulnerability.\n\nAs authorities ramp up arrests and deportations, experts and activists continue to debate whether this strategy addresses the root causes or simply exacerbates the crisis.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/most-african-men-at-risk-of-prostate-cancer-new-study-flags-genetic-causes/",
            "content": "The Conversation\n\nA breakthrough study has identified the genetic risk factors that contribute to increased prostate cancer in African men. The study, the largest of its kind, recruited 7,500 men from eastern, southern and west Africa. The study is especially important because African men have a high risk of prostate cancer.\n\nMedical scientistWenlong Carl Chenexplains why the findings are significant and the promise they hold for future treatment.\n\nProstate cancer disproportionately affects men ofAfrican descent. Studies from the US and African countries report ahigher occurrence of prostate cancer in men of African ancestrywhen compared with men of other ancestries. Men of African and African Caribbean ancestry were also found to be at higher risk of developing amore aggressive form of prostate cancerand of developing it at a younger age when compared with men of European ancestry. Prostate cancer also accounts for nearly one-quarter of all cancer cases diagnosed in Africa.\n\nOurstudyaimed at uncovering aspects of genetic architecture of prostate cancer that were specific to men of African descent. In other words, we wanted to understand what it is about African mens genetic makeup that puts them at higher risk for prostate cancer.\n\nEvidence emerging in theliteraturesuggests that genetic risk factors significantly contribute to the development of prostate cancer. Genetic risks can be put into two groups:\n\nHereditary risk factors or germline mutations:There are rare genetic mutations in genes, such asBRCA1andBRCA2, that have been linked to increased risks for developing cancers. Mutations inBRCA2particularly are linked to higher risks of developing more aggressive prostate cancer.\n\nSingle nucleotide polymorphisms or variants:These are common genetic variants that are linked to increased disease risk. Each variant by itself confers a very small increase in risk. But several variants combined may raise the risk profiles for a disease.\n\nIn this study, we assessed the risk contributed by inherited genetic variants to prostate cancer.\n\nDespite the high burden of disease, genetic studies of prostate cancer in continental African populations are limited. The technology needed for these studies is typically very expensive and requires specialised instruments which are very scarce in Africa.\n\nTo better understand the geneticcausesof disease, we needed to study diverse populations, particularly African populations. African populations have muchhigher genetic diversitywhen compared with other populations. As the place oforigin ofHomo sapiens, the African population is much older than other populations and has therefore had more time to accumulate genetic variations.\n\nOurs is the largest study to date to investigate the ancestry-specific genetic architectures and disease associations for prostate cancer across multiple regions in sub-Saharan Africa.\n\nNumerous studies like this have been conducted worldwide. But participation from Africa, both in terms of researchers and study participants, is very low.\n\nOur consortium, theMen of African Descent, Carcinoma of the Prostate(MADCaP), was formed in 2016. Hospitals and universities in five African countries  Nigeria, Ghana, Senegal, Uganda and South Africa  partnered with several US-based universities to form the consortium. The US National Institute of Health provided funding.\n\nThe African centres enrolled men with newly diagnosed prostate cancer and, as controls, men of the same population groups who did not have cancer. Demographic, social, economic, and clinical information and bio-samples were collected from the participants.\n\nOur study consisted of 3,963 prostate cancer cases and 3,509 controls. Most bio-sample processing and genotyping was performed in Africa, using a custom genotyping array. A genotyping array provides information on hundreds of thousands of DNA variants. This specific one was designed and optimised to capture African genetic variations.\n\nWe identified three loci (genetic regions) with a strong association with increased prostate cancer incidence. The lead signals within these loci were common in African populations but were almost absent in non-African populations.\n\nAlthough these three loci were previously found in other populations, our signals within these loci are unique to African populations. They would not have been found if we had not studied African populations.\n\nThere are also differences within Africa. The genetic parts that contribute to prostate cancer risk differ by geographical population.\n\nIt is crucial to study diseases in populations with the highest disease burden.\n\nOur findings highlight the importance of studying the possible causes of disease in diverse populations.\n\nWe found novel associations by studying the genetics of prostate cancer across Africa. These signals would not have been found in studies done outside Africa.\n\nThe genetic diversity of African populations further allowed us to fine-map the regions of associations to better understand whats driving the signals.\n\nOur findings pave the way for the development of genetic tools that could grade people by their degree of risk.\n\nAnother example of this was a 2019studypublished in the American Journal of Human Genetics which used genetics to predict the risk of breast cancer. Women placed in higher risk groups would become eligible to enter the UK breast cancerscreening programmeat a much earlier age.\n\nThe results from our study will lay the foundation for the development and implementation of similar tools in an African setting.\n\nResearcher, University of the Witwatersrand\n\nThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.Read the original articlehere.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/diaspora-marriages-can-counselling-keep-couples-connected/",
            "content": "Zimbabwe has long been shaped by migration. Many families are split between those who remain at home and those who seek better opportunities abroad. These separations often lead to long-distance marriages that face unique challenges. While remittances can ease financial burdens, the emotional cost of separation is more challenging to address.\n\nDiaspora marriages often struggle with trust, communication, and maintaining emotional intimacy. Partners in different countries experience life differently, leading to a growing gap in shared experiences. For some, cultural adjustments in new countries create conflicts as values shift, often without the other partners knowledge. Time zone differences, work pressures, and the lack of physical presence compound these issues, leaving both partners isolated.\n\nInfidelity, mistrust, and financial disagreements are common problems. One partner may suspect the other of infidelity or feel neglected due to reduced communication. On the other hand, the partner abroad may feel unappreciated despite their efforts to support the family financially. These tensions can cause resentment, making the relationship increasingly fragile.\n\nHow Marriage Counselling Can Help\n\nIncreasingly, especially in our online world, marriage counselling, offers a solution for couples facing these challenges. It provides a neutral platform where both partners can express their concerns without fear of judgment. Counsellors help couples rebuild trust and develop strategies for managing long-distance relationships. They focus on improving communication and helping partners understand each others needs and expectations.\n\nOnline counselling has become particularly relevant for diaspora marriages. Virtual sessions offer flexibility, allowing couples in different time zones to participate without disrupting their schedules. Platforms likeTherapyRoutethat connect individuals with trained professionals experienced in diaspora marriage issues make this more accessible.\n\nLocal support is also available. Organizations such as theChristian Counselling Centre in Harareprovide faith-based guidance that aligns with cultural and religious values.\n\nPractical Steps for Strengthening Diaspora Marriages\n\nAddressing the challenges of a long-distance marriage starts with honest communication.\n\nPartners must commit to regular check-ins, whether through video calls, voice notes, or written messages. Setting aside time to connect emotionallyeven with tight scheduleshelps keep the relationship alive.\n\nTrust is often key to successful long-distance relationships. Counsellors guide couples in rebuilding trust by addressing underlying insecurities and agreeing on boundaries. This process might include setting expectations around finances, social interactions, or how decisions are made while apart. Clear agreements reduce misunderstandings and help both partners feel secure.\n\nAnother critical aspect is maintaining a shared vision for the future. Partners should discuss their long-term goals: Will the family reunite? What sacrifices are necessary to achieve financial or career objectives? Counsellors often encourage couples to keep these conversations ongoing, ensuring both feel involved in shaping their future.\n\nWhile counselling sessions are key, couples must also take practical steps outside therapy. Shared rituals, such as watching the same movie from different locations or praying together over the phone, can foster emotional closeness. Sending thoughtful messages or small gifts can remind a partner they are valued and appreciated.\n\nA Final Word on Diaspora Marriages\n\nDiaspora marriages are a testament to resilience and sacrifice. They endure long distances, cultural adjustments, and financial pressures, all in pursuit of better opportunities. But these challenges can strain even the strongest relationships.\n\nMarriage counselling, when approached with an open mind, equips couples with the tools to communicate better, resolve conflicts, and maintain emotional intimacy. The journey is not easy, but with effort, patience, and the right support, it can lead to stronger, more fulfilling relationships.\n\nIf you or someone you know is navigating the complexities of a diaspora marriage, take that first step and reach out to trusted community leaders or professionals, and commit to investing in the future of your partnership.\n\n",
