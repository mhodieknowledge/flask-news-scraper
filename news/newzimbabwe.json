We need some formal jobs so that we can leave the streets. Its difficult to remain in-doors at home when you have no basics such as food, Rudo Murotsi of Mufakose said.One Leroy Kufa from Glen View Area 8, a university graduate from Class of 2015, said he had never been employed after leaving college, turning to vending since then but had managed to send his siblings to school.So, how are we going to survive? Kufa asked rhetorically.During the 2024 Local Authorities Performance Outcome feed back workshop in Harare last Thursday, Garwe reiterated the ban and ordered council officials countrywide to make sure that all cities, towns and growth points chuck off vendors by December this year.Lets just accept that we created these problems. We must be able to deal with these problems. We want to see clean cities.I want to see all the cities clean. I dont know how we are going to do it. At least by the end of this year, our cities must be clean.Everybody must be willing to come to Harare, to come to ulawayo, to go to Mutare, to go to Masvingo, from wherever they are outside our country. Lets clean our cities. This is our motto., Garwe said.Lets reintroduce the culture of cleanliness to citizens.And we also want to know that street vending and night vending are banned. Street vending and night vending are born out of the importation of second-hand clothing, which is banned.

So this narrative that people have nothing to do, we are messing up people, its all hogwash.We must make hard and tough decisions to clean these cities. There must be tough decisions. Both tough decisions, positive results will come out, he added.So, there is banning of second-hand clothing importation, subsequent banning of street vending, and subsequent banning of night vending.These are directives that are coming from His Excellency. We actually have a Statutory lnstrument through the Minister of Industry and Commerce to ban the importationWe dont need that anymore.

We must be able to deal with these problems. We want to see clean cities.\n\nI want to see all the cities clean. I dont know how we are going to do it. At least by the end of this year, our cities must be clean.Everybody must be willing to come to Harare, to come to ulawayo, to go to Mutare, to go to Masvingo, from wherever they are outside our country. Lets clean our cities. This is our motto., Garwe said.Lets reintroduce the culture of cleanliness to citizens.And we also want to know that street vending and night vending are banned. Street vending and night vending are born out of the importation of second-hand clothing, which is banned. And the responsibility to remove these people from our streets and from operating at night is ours, said added.The minister took a swipe at night-vending alleging only abuse of drugs and substances takes place during the evenings along the streets of the capital city.There is no positive night vending that is taking place.

Or a woman leaving her husband or boyfriend to say, look, Im sorry, I have to go. Im going for shopping now. There is nobody. So this narrative that people have nothing to do, we are messing up people, its all hogwash.We must make hard and tough decisions to clean these cities. There must be tough decisions. Both tough decisions, positive results will come out, he added.So, there is banning of second-hand clothing importation, subsequent banning of street vending, and subsequent banning of night vending.These are directives that are coming from His Excellency.
