He believes that strategic litigation and advocacy are essential for shaping a future free of human rights abuses.\n\nThe new ZCTU secretary general understands the link between politics and workers struggle although he believes that workers must play politics in a non-partisan manner. He also appreciates that workers must form alliances with political players based on common issues.\n\nIn his acceptance speech, Marimo pledged to immediately secure the independence of the ZCTU from vested political interests in the country.\n\nOur movement grows stronger not in the absence of competition, but in the presence of unity after competition. Let us continue to walk this journey together, for our struggle is far greater than any one individual.\n\nAs secretary general, I pledge to safeguard the independence and integrity of the ZCTU, strengthen the voice of every affiliate union and ensure that no worker feels excluded from our collective shield while fighting relentlessly for policies that uplift workers and defend their rights in workplaces, courts, and on the national stage, he said.\n\nHe called for the support of the countrys working class and citizens as he underscored that taking the ZCTU back to its former glory will not be an easy road.\n\nComrades, we have sent a clear message today: ZCTU belongs to the workers  it is their shield, their voice, their weapon of justice! History shows that workers united cannot be defeated, added Marimo.\n\n",
