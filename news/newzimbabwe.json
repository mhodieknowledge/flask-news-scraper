            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nRENOWNED lawyer, Thabani Mpofu has poked holes into President Emmerson Mnangagwas decision to extend General Philip Valerio Sibandas term of office as the Commander of the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) by one year.\n\nSibanda, who turned 70 on December 24, 2024, officially reached the mandatory retirement age, which, according to Mpofu, renders any extension of his term invalid.\n\nPosting on social media, Mpofu described Mnangagwas decision as flawed since the concerned official had already reached the retirement age and, therefore, could not simultaneously hold an active position.\n\nMnangagwa has now purported to extend General Sibandas appointment until November 23, 2025, through General Notice 15 of 2025, issued on January 3, 2025. This decision is flawed for two reasons:\n\nExpired Term: A term that has already expired cannot be extended. Thats why there are no oxygen canisters at the cemetery.\n\nRetirement Age: General Sibanda has reached the mandatory retirement age of 70. He cannot be retired and in active service at the same time. It is one thing to recycle dead wood, it is quite another to plant a dead log, said Mpofu.\n\nThe latest development, viewed as a power consolidation strategy as Mnangagwa reportedly seeks a third presidential term, is in Mpofus opinion a troubling trend.\n\nWhat a way to start a year! And for Mnangagwa, what a way to perpetuate a disgraceful legacy anchored on absurdities and illegalities, said Mpofu.\n\nSibanda has served as the Commander of the ZDF since 2017, succeeding the current Vice President, Constantino Chiwenga, who previously held the position.\n\n",

This approach underlines the importance of rehabilitation over retribution in Zimbabwes justice system.\n\nThe ZHRC highly commends the unity of purpose demonstrated by the political leadership across the political divide, notably, Honourable Edwin Mushoriwa who introduced the Private Members Bill in November 2023, Honourable Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi who facilitated the passage, Members of Parliament as a whole, and His Excellency Dr. E. D. Mnangagwa who signed the Bill into law, ZHRC said.\n\nGovernment was further called on to ratify outstanding international treaties such as the UN Convention Against Torture.\n\nThis milestone achievement symbolises Zimbabwes commitment to upholding constitutional, regional and international human rights standards. In that vein the ZHRC therefore urges the Government of Zimbabwe to maintain the momentum and ratify outstanding treaties, particularly the UN Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhumane or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CAT), and the UN Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance (CED), ZHRC said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE standard precautionary pest control measure to destroy tobacco seedbeds for the 2024/25 cropping season has been moved to January 15, 2025.\n\nBefore the latest development, it was expected that farmers would have put out seedbeds by New Years Eve.\n\nIn a recent statement, the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (TIMB), which regulates the golden leaf industry, said the extension was done under the Plant Pests and Diseases (Tobacco) Regulations, 1979, which mandated that all tobacco seedbeds be destroyed by December 31 to break the life cycle of pests and diseases that can affect tobacco plants.\n\nThe slow start to the rain season has seen most farmers delaying transplanting the crops, hence extension of the grace period by which seedbeds should have been removed.\n\nHowever, due to a prolonged dry spell and delayed rains, farmers relying on rain-fed dryland tobacco could not transplant in time due to insufficient water resources.\n\nThe Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Water, Fisheries, and Rural Development Dr Anxious Masuka, has extended the deadline for destroying tobacco seedbeds to 15 January 2025, said TIMB.\n\nTIMB said the decision ensured farmers could preserve their investments and reap the benefits of their months of hard work.\n\nTobacco is Zimbabwes second largest foreign currency earner after gold and is primarily cultivated by smallholder farmers, who were allocated land under the land reform programme Zimbabwe embarked on in 2000.\n\nDespite the adverse impact of the El-Nino-induced drought experienced last year due to a poor rainfall pattern in the 2023/24 summer cropping season, the country recorded 236 million kilogrammes of the golden leaf.\n\nTobacco production involves sowing seeds and maintaining a seedbed for three months, land preparation and preparing ridges onto which they will transplant the seedlings.\n\nTherefore, destroying all tobacco plants in seedbeds means farmers cannot transplant anymore.\n\nThe December rains brought relief and optimism for dryland tobacco growers, marking a turning point for the 2024/25 season, said TIMB.\n\nAs of December 27, 2024, growers had transplanted 84 661 hectares, surpassing the 82 392ha recorded during the same period in 2023.\n\nAdditionally, a total of 126 092 growers have been registered, compared to 112 904 growers in 2023.\n\nThese figures highlight the industrys resilience and growth, with a national target of 300 million kilograms of tobacco set for the season.\n\nTo ensure success, the focus for this season remains on adopting climate-smart agriculture practices that build resilience against erratic weather patterns.\n\nTobacco growers are encouraged to control weeds to reduce competition for water, use potholes to capture rainfall and prevent runoff, and maintain proper ridges for efficient drainage.\n\n",
