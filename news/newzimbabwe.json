            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nFORMER Finance Minister Tendai Biti has slammed University of Zimbabwe (UZ) Vice Chancellor Paul Mapfumos decision to dismiss striking lecturers and suspend student activists supporting the job action.\n\nHe described sanctions against the striking tutors and students union leaders as failure from an arrogant and incompetent leader.A few days back, six students who are members of the Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) were suspended for holding a demonstration in May in support of their striking lecturers, who have been on an ongoing industrial action since April 16.Two weeks earlier, the UZ administration fired four leaders of the ongoing lecturers strike for using the great hall without approval from authorities, a dismissal that they felt was a way to stop the strike.The suspension of student activists and the dismissal of leaders of the Association of University Teachers UZ is another blatant example of the failure and high-handedness of the vacuous, incompetent leadership of the UZ.Prof Mapfumo is an arrogant incompetent Vice Chancellor who mirrors the glaring ignorance and fascism of those he serves.Universities are citadels of the highest forms of cerebral engagement. They cannot be reduced to rag tag sub committees of a corrupt kleptocratic ruling party taken over by a greedy illiterate parasitic elite, Biti said.The lecturers are demanding a salary increase to at least US$2,250 from their current US$250 as well as improved working conditions.Meanwhile, Gift Ostallos Siziba, the former Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) Member of Parliament for Pelandaba Tshabala constituency, called for an immediate reinstatement of six suspended students and demanded justice for lecturers facing hardship and unpaid salaries.We stand in solidarity with ZINASU and join the call for justice for students and lecturers who have endured months of hardship, including unpaid salaries.We will not stand idly by as the future of our youth and the integrity of our academic institutions are compromised, Siziba said.\n\nHe described sanctions against the striking tutors and students union leaders as failure from an arrogant and incompetent leader.\n\nA few days back, six students who are members of the Zimbabwe National Students Union (ZINASU) were suspended for holding a demonstration in May in support of their striking lecturers, who have been on an ongoing industrial action since April 16.Two weeks earlier, the UZ administration fired four leaders of the ongoing lecturers strike for using the great hall without approval from authorities, a dismissal that they felt was a way to stop the strike.The suspension of student activists and the dismissal of leaders of the Association of University Teachers UZ is another blatant example of the failure and high-handedness of the vacuous, incompetent leadership of the UZ.Prof Mapfumo is an arrogant incompetent Vice Chancellor who mirrors the glaring ignorance and fascism of those he serves.Universities are citadels of the highest forms of cerebral engagement.

Women in the lowest wealth quintile have significantly more children (5.5) compared to those in the highest quintile (2.6). Women in the lowest wealth quintile have their first birth, on average, three years earlier (19.0 years) than women in the highest quintile (21.9 years), the study says.These findings mirror the situation in Zimbabwe where couples, especially in urban areas are reducing the sizes of their families.Total Fertility Rate (TFR)  the average number of children a woman would have by the end of her childbearing years if she bore children at the current age-specific fertility rates  dropped 4.3 children per woman in 1994 to 3.8 in 2005-06. Since then, it has remained largely stable, currently standing at 3.9 in the 2023-24 Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Survey.On average, a woman in Zimbabwe will have about four children in her lifetime (TRF 3.9). When disaggregated by place of birth women in rural areas (about 5 children per woman  TFT 4,6 tend to have more children than those in urban areas (about 3 children per woman  TFR 3.1). Women in urban areas begin childbearing 2 years later, on average, than rural women (21.1 versus 19.4 years).Even if women, especially those in the workplace, desire to have more children childcare responsibilities often makes it difficult for them to pursue career advancement, maintain full-time employment or engage in professional development opportunities. This in part explains why women in the highest wealth quintile have fewer children.In his keynote address to mark the World Population Day, which coincided with the reports launch, Health and Child Care Minister, Dr Douglas Mombeshora affirmed the governments stance on upholding reproductive rights.The Government of Zimbabwe upholds reproductive rights, empowering individuals to choose the number, timing, and spacing of children they want to have, free from coercion.Fertility rates are a key driver of Zimbabwes continued population growth and contribute significantly to its youthful demographic structure. We will continue to support policies to ensure we prevent low birth rates, he said.UK Development Director and Deputy Head of Mission Dr. Jo Abbot said the UK is proud to stand with Zimbabwe and UNFPA in championing reproductive rights and choices.Vast numbers of people are unable to create the families they want, said Dr. Natalia Kanem, Executive Director of UNFPA.The issue is lack of choice, not desire, with major consequences for individuals and societies.

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE United Kingdom has implored Zimbabwe to exercise vigilance in the wake of dwindling donor support towards the countrys health care system.\n\nThe calls come on the back of the US bold decision to cut back financial handouts globally a move which has left the developing world in dire straits. The donor community has played a pivotal role in easing deficits experienced in the countrys health sector over the years.But speaking during a plenary discussion at a UNFPA organized event to officially commemorate the World Population Day, British Embassy Health Adviser, Tessa Mattholie warned that it will not be business as usual anymore.The amount of money coming from external partners into the health sector in just Zimbabwe alone is about half a billion US dollars a year, about 500 million US dollars a year.
