            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZANU PF Legal Secretary Patrick Chinamasa has said controversial businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei is now a member of the partys Central Committee and the matter is over and irreversible.\n\nTagwireis co-option into the Central Committee has dragged on, with a faction within the ruling party reportedly opposed to his endorsement into the influential organ.\n\nIn a statement posted on socialmedia, Chinamasa said, The Zanupf Department of Legal Affairs is relieved and takes note that the furore/controversy/confusion/wrangle/much ado about nothing/social media hype/misinformation/disinformation that surrounded Harare Provincial Coordinating Committee (PCC) co-option of Cde Kudakwashe Tagwirei into the Zanu PF Central Committee is now over and irreversibly settled.\n\nFrom the outset, it was difficult to understand the source of the problem. Our Harare PCC convened on Monday, 31 March 2025, and voted to recommend the cooption of Cde Tagwirei into the Central Committee.\n\nThe Province addressed the letter of recommendation to the Zanupf Secretary General, Cde Dr. Obert Moses Mpofu. The letter was copied to the Departments of the Commissariat and Legal Affairs, amongst others.\n\nThe confirmation by Chinamsa is in contradiction with the ZANU PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwasremarks earlier this month that Tagwireis bribe would not work in the party.\n\nTagwireis admission into this elite structure is being widely interpreted as part of a long-term strategy to position him for a future presidential bid, setting him on a collision course with other factions, particularly those aligned with Vice President Constantino Chiwenga.\n\nThe ZANU PF benefactor has been viewed as exploiting his proximity to President Emmerson Mnangagwa to push his leadership agenda.\n\nChinamasa acknowledged that the co-option of Tagwirei has been divisive in the ruling party.\n\nSo the controversy surrounding Cde Tagwireis co-option into the Central Committee surprises me and took me completely off guard. Given Cde Tagwireis commitment to Zanupf and his track record in the service of the Party, the somewhat negative publicity and narrative surrounding his co-option into the Central Committee is undeserved.\n\nI have been a member of the Zanupf Central Committee continuously and without break since December 1987, and a member of the Zanupf Politburo since the year 2000 to date, and I can state unequivocally that throughout this long period of nearly 38 years as Central Committee or as Politburo, we have never had to debate, let alone discuss, PCC recommendations of cooptions into the Central Committee. We always treated such recommendations as fait accompli.\n\nThe cooption of Cde Tagwirei is the first ever to be the subject of discussion and social media commentaries. The only explanation why the Tagwirei cooption has attracted such controversy may be because there are people out there who, for reasons best known to themselves, have an axe to grind, said Chinamasa.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nA BBC Africa Eye investigation has revealed how women, known as madams, have involved children as young as 13 in prostitution in Kenya.\n\nIn the transit town of Maai Mahiu, in Kenyas Rift Valley, trucks and lorries pound the streets day and night transporting goods and people across the country into Uganda, Rwanda, South Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo.\n\nThe key transport hub, just 50km (31 miles) east of the capital, Nairobi, is known for prostitution, but it is also a breeding ground for child sexual abuse.\n\nTwo undercover investigators, posing as sex workers wanting to learn how to become madams, spent months earlier this year infiltrating the sex trade in the town.\n\nTheir secret filming reveals two different women who say they know it is illegal and then introduce the investigators to underage girls in the sex industry.\n\nThe BBC gave all its evidence to the Kenyan police in March. The BBC believes the madams have moved location since then. The police said the women and young girls we filmed could not be traced. To date there have been no arrests.\n\nConvictions are rare in Kenya. For successful prosecutions, police need testimonies from children. Often vulnerable minors are too afraid to testify.\n\nThe BBCs grainy footage filmed on the street in the dark showed one woman, who calls herself Nyambura, laughing as she says: Theyre still children, so its easy to manipulate them by just handing them sweets.\n\nProstitution is a cash crop in Maai Mahiu; the truckers basically fuel it. And thats how we benefit. Its been normalised in Maai Mahiu, she explained, adding that she had one girl as young as 13, who had already been working for six months.\n\nIt becomes very risky when youre dealing with minors. You cant just bring them outopenly in town. I only sneak them out at night in great secrecy, Nyambura said.\n\nThe act of prostitution by a consenting adult is not explicitly criminalised under Kenyan national law but it is banned by many municipal by-laws. It is not banned in Maai Mahiu, which is part of Nakuru county.\n\nUnder the penal code it is illegal to live from the earnings of prostitution, either as a sex worker or third party facilitating or profiting from prostitution.\n\nThe trafficking or sale of minors under the age of 18 carries a prison sentence ranging from 10 years to life.\n\nWhen asked whether the clients wear condoms, Nyambura said she usually made sure they had protection but the odd one did not.\n\nSome children want to earn more [so dont use them]. Some are forced [not to use them], she said.\n\nIn another meeting, she led the undercover investigator to a house where three young girls sat huddled on a sofa, another on a hard-backed chair.\n\nNyambura then left the room, giving the investigator an opportunity to speak to the girls alone.\n\nThey described being repeatedly abused for sex, on a daily basis.\n\nSometimes you have sex with multiple people. The clients force you to do unimaginable things, said one of the girls.\n\nThere are no recent statistics on the number of children forced to work in Kenyas sex industry. In 2012,the US State Department Country Report on Human Rights Practices in Kenyacited an estimate of 30,000, a figure derived from the Kenyan government and now defunct non-governmental organisation (NGO), Eradicate Child Prostitution in Kenya.\n\nOther studies have focused on specific areas, especially along the countrys coast  known for its tourist resorts.A 2022 reportfor the NGO Global Fund to End Modern Slavery found almost 2,500 children were forced into sex work in Kilifi and Kwale counties.\n\nA second undercover investigator gained the trust of a woman who called herself Cheptoo and had multiple meetings with her.\n\nShe said selling young girls meant she could earn a living and be comfortable.\n\nYou carry out this kind of business in great secrecy because it is illegal, she said.\n\nIf anyone says they want a young girl, I ask them to pay me. We also have our regulars who always come back for them.\n\nCheptoo took the undercover investigator to a club to meet four of her girls. The youngest said she was 13 years old. The others said they were 15.\n\nShe opened up about the profit she makes from them, saying for every 3,000 Kenyan shillings ($23; 17) the girls deliver, her share was 2,500 shillings ($19; 14).\n\nAt another meeting, in a house in Maai Mahiu, Cheptoo left the undercover investigator alone with two underage girls.\n\nOne of them told her she had, on average, sex with five men a day.\n\nWhen asked what happened if she refused to have sex without a condom, she said she had no choice.\n\nI have to [have sex without a condom]. I will be chased away, and I have nowhere to run to. I am an orphan.\n\nKenyas sex industry is a complex, murky world where both men and women are involved in facilitating child prostitution.\n\nIt is not known how many children are forced into sex work in Maai Mahiu, but in this small town of around 50,000 people it is easy to find them.\n\nA former sex worker, known as Baby Girl, now provides refuge in Maai Mahiu for girls who have escaped sexual abuse.\n\nThe 61-year-old worked in the sex industry for 40 years  first finding herself on the streets in her early twenties. She was pregnant and had her three young children with her after fleeing her husband because of domestic violence.\n\nAt her wooden kitchen table in a bright parlour at the front of her house, she introduced the BBC to four young women who were all forced into sex work by madams in Maai Mahiu when they were children.\n\nEach girl shared similar stories of broken families or abuse at home  they came to Maai Mahiu to escape, only to be violently abused again.\n\nMichelle described how, at 12 years old, she lost her parents to HIV and was evicted on to the streets where she met a man who gave her somewhere to live and began sexually abusing her.\n\nI literally had to pay him in kind for educating me. I reached my limit, but I had no-one, she said.\n\nTwo years later, she was approached by a woman who turned out to be a madam in Maai Mahiu and forced her into sex work.\n\nLilian, who is now 19, also lost her parents at a very young age. She was left with an uncle who filmed her in the shower and sold the images to his friends. The voyeurism soon turned into rape.\n\nThat was my worst day. I was 12 then.\n\nWhen she escaped, she was raped again by a truck driver who took her to Maai Mahiu. It was here, like Michelle, where she was approached by a woman who forced her into sex work.\n\nThese young womens short lives have been fuelled by violence, neglect and abuse.\n\nNow, housed by Baby Girl, they are learning new skills  two in a photography studio and two in a beauty salon.\n\nThey also assist Baby Girl with her outreach work in the community.\n\nNakuru county has one of the highest rates of HIV infection in Kenya, and Baby Girl, supported by US aid agency USAID, is on a mission to educate people about the risks of unprotected sex.\n\nShe has an office at Karagita Community Health Centre, near Lake Naivasha, where she works providing condoms and advice.\n\nHowever, with US President Donald Trumps decision to pull USAID funding, her outreach programmes are about to stop.\n\nYou see how vulnerable these children are. How would they survive on their own? They are still healing.\n\nThe US government did not respond to comments in this investigation about the likely impact of its funding cuts. USAID officially closed last month.\n\nFor now, Lilian is focused on learning photography and recovering from abuse.\n\nI am not afraid any more, because Baby Girl is there for me, she said. She is helping us bury the past.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nA NURSE at Bikita Rural Hospital in Masvingo province, who was seriously injured by a violent maternity patient while on duty seven years ago, is now bedridden without compensation, support, and medical care she was denied by the government.\n\nOn the night of August 13, 2018, Progress Muzuva left Bikita Rural Hospital after she was assigned to escort a pregnant patient in need of emergency care to Silveira Mission Hospital as part of her duties.\n\nThe patient she was escorting seemed stable when they began the journey, but suddenly became violent, screaming, throwing herself against the ambulances body, and trying to leap from the moving vehicle in a bid to commit suicide.\n\nMuzuva fought to save her patient from taking her own life while the ambulance bounced along the rural road. The driver was reportedly unaware of the chaos in the back.\n\nAt one point, the woman smashed the ambulance window and tried to leap out. That is when the driver realised something was amiss and finally stopped and opened the door, only to be greeted by punches. The patient then fled.\n\nMuzuva and the driver chased her through the darkness and brought her back into the ambulance.\n\nMuzuva, fearing another outburst, refused to leave the woman alone and stayed in the back of the ambulance.\n\nMoments later, the woman went into labour and Muzuva delivered the baby with her bare hands.\n\nThe violent mother, now delusional, accused Muzuva of swapping the baby upon realising it was a girl and started screaming and trying to kill the infant.\n\nI was shielding the newly born baby from her mother who wanted to kill her with one hand holding the slippery baby while another one pushing the bleeding mother away, Muzuva narrated her ordeal to NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nMuzuva and the driver finally arrived at Silveira and handed over the baby and the mother safely; however, her own body was broken.\n\nA seasoned obstetrician and gynaecologist told NewZimbabwe.com that the patients condition may have been triggered by postnatal depression that may be caused by social circumstances.\n\nThis may have been a result of the social circumstances she was in. Maybe she was looking for a boy child for a long time and this may have made her end up rejecting the child and going through a condition called Puerperal Psychosis\n\nSometimes the patient may also have suffered from an underlying psychotic disorder, previously or bipolar.\n\nMost of these psychotic issues happen soon after delivery. About 80% of women experience postpartum blues, which usually last a few days. 20% of women also suffer from postpartum depression which most people do not take seriously as it is mild.\n\nAbout 2% to 5% of women suffer from puerperal psychosis, which happened in this situation and this is the far end of postpartum depression, he explained.\n\nDenied medical assistance by the government\n\nThe following day after the incident, Muzuva realised she had sustained serious injuries as her left leg was swollen, and she could barely walk.\n\nX-rays confirmed her leg was fractured and her spine had been injured.\n\nThe government which is the very institution she served, turned its back on her.\n\nI was given a normal sick leave instead of compensatory sick leave, which is supposed to be given to someone who has been injured while on duty. I was referred to a neurosurgeon in Gweru at Claybank Hospital, Muzuva said.\n\nHer requests for an ambulance to travel to specialist hospitals were denied. Authorities from the district office refused even to write her a letter explaining how she got injured.\n\nThe process of having to find money delayed her from getting assistance while her condition deteriorated.\n\nI struggled to get money and I finally managed to hire a commuter omnibus, removing seats and lying on a mattress just to get to my appointments as I cannot sit anymore, she narrated.\n\nShe paid for every CT scan, every X-ray, and every consultation out of her own pocket money, which she did not have.\n\nShe is now bedridden and owes US$11,000 in medical bills, and has to go through another surgery.\n\nDespite multiple specialist referrals, Muzuva was denied government assistance at every turn.\n\nMedical reports seen by NewZimbabwe.com show that a neurosurgeon confirmed that her spine was fractured and required immediate surgery.\n\nThe Ministry of Health refused to help and turned down every ambulance request or financial assistance.\n\nBetrayed by a system which does not care\n\nMuzuva only got her full salary in the first two months after sick leave and in the third month, the salary was deducted by 50%.\n\nShe kept begging the human resource (HR) manager to put her on compensatory sick leave so she could get her full salary and other assistance, but was told off.\n\nI really needed the salary for medical expenses and I kept begging the District HR to put me on compensatory sick leave and he said to me, if you now want to work here at the HR offices, you may come and I will come and sleep in that bed as you, Muzuva told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nAfter a full year of agony, Muzuva finally underwent spinal surgery in December 2019 at Parirenyatwa Hospital.\n\nAccording to her, four days later, Bikita District HR called her to come so they could discuss her situation, and she explained to her that she could not manage as she had gone through surgery and was still recovering in the hospital.\n\nThe HR made it clear that if she failed to present herself immediately, she should not bother them with her matter. This threat forced Muzuva to hire transport and make the journey, only to be told the medical board she was supposed to meet was not available.\n\nShe had to hire a car back to Parirenyatwa Hospital in Harare to continue with her admission.\n\nHer spine continued to deteriorate, she could no longer sit, walk, or use the toilet and started wearing adult diapers.\n\nLater in 2021, while her health worsened, the government deepened its betrayal and wrote to her saying it wanted her to retire but she refused on the basis that the letter stated she was not injured at work, which meant she was not entitled to the compensation she was supposed to get.\n\nSince then, she used to do follow ups and they have ignored her.\n\nShe reached every responsible office in the ministry from the district level to the minister and has been ignored, denied access, had calls dropped, and denied appointments.\n\nAt one point, she was allegedly told by an official, one Miss Masale in Masvingo province, that I am your employer and if I am quiet, it means there is nothing which needs us to communicate, we have the whole province to run, so I do not bath to just come and handle your matter alone. So I will call you,usandinetse, she said.\n\nDoctors recommended another operation, but again, she lacked the money.\n\nIn January 2023, she underwent a second major operation to install rods and screws in her back and she was assisted by private doctors out of pity, even when she could not afford it.\n\nThe procedure was too late to stop the permanent damage and she still needs reviews, MRIs, and dynamic X-rays but she cannot afford them.\n\nIn September 2023, Muzuva had her last check-up, and two years have now passed without medical follow-up.\n\nNdonzwa kubaiwa (I feel stabbing pain when I move, when I step. The iron in my back is shifting, but I cannot go back for help, Muzuva trembled as she narrated her story to this publication.\n\nSince 2023 to date, Muzuva has been home and she went to the Masvingo Provincial Medical Director earlier this year and was denied access.\n\nShe then went to the provincial HR office where another unidentified official who was there said: munonetsa imimi handiti makati munozvigona mukaenda kuhead office saka mazovingei kuno.\n\nIn 2024, she learned that the ministry had forged a letter on her behalf showing she had accepted retirement in 2022.\n\nThrough the back and forth of trying to get her deserved assistance, Muzuva then got to know that the government had even hired a legal team to handle her case as they tried to deny she was injured at work.\n\nSeven years still investigating while her health deteriorates\n\nMeanwhile, after facing a deluge of criticism over the matter, the panicky Ministry of Health issued a press statement at the weekend saying it is reviewing Muzuvas case through legal and administrative channels.\n\nThe Ministry wishes to clarify that this case has not been ignored by the current administration. In fact, procedures are actively underway to assist her.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that resolution of such matters is not a one-day event. Reviewing a case that dates back to 2018 requires careful and thorough examination of both records and procedures.\n\nTo that end, the matter was referred to the ministrys legal advisors to assess whether all applicable legal and human resources guidelines were properly followed during her handling, including her leave, retirement, and any associated benefits, reads a statement from the underfire ministry.\n\n",
