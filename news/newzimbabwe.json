Failure to pay monthly rentals is a serious breach of the agreement of lease which mandates City of Harare to evoke the conditions of lease and recover holding costs from the same.\n\nNotwithstanding the availability or none of the lease agreement, council shall not be prejudiced in its rights to recover holding costs from the lessee for breach of mutual understanding, read the notice.\n\nThe notice comes on the back of Harare City, on the drive to recover money it is being owed by tenants leasing their properties.\n\nHowever, in Mbare, Harare City is under pressure to renovate the flats which are becoming uninhabitable.\n\nLast year, the High Court ordered Harare City Council to renovate the flats to match decent living standards. The City fathers have appealed the judgement.\n\nIn an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) director, Ruben Akili, said the deplorable living conditions have dissuaded tenants from paying their rentals.\n\nThese are the same flats which we had a court order for renovations. As you are aware all the flats in Mbare were supposed to be renovated. The situation in Mbare is unacceptable sewer is gushing all over and many things are just happening and many things are happening.\n\nFrom CHRAs perspective is that some residents are paying and some are not paying. Local Authority should address the fundamental problems that speaks to the reasons why residents are not paying, said Akili.\n\n",

He has raised more than 35,000 forcharityas a result.\n\nThe bishop and his dog completed the challenge on Sunday, having averaged a marathon a day across some of Englands wildest terrain  from Edale in the Peak District to Kirk Yetholm just over the Scottish border  with an incline of nearly 40,000 feet.\n\nDr Gainsborough said on Tuesday: Running the equivalent of a marathon a day for ten days was pretty brutal as it is wild and mountainous terrain, and it is quite easy to lose the path.\n\nTo say that he enjoyed the experience would be overstating it, he said, but to have made it through without injury was deeply exhilarating. He said: Jem, who was magnificent throughout, is now enjoying a more sedentary pace in Southfields.\n\nThe Bishop set out on 1 August with an initial target of raising 30,000 to improve education in the diocese of Matabeleland, inZimbabwe, with whichSouthwark dioceseis linked.\n\nHe had been inspired by the children and teachers he met on a visit to the region last year, where many children currently walk up to 10km to get to their nearest school  a dangerous journey which means that many, particularly girls, are unable to attend.\n\nMartinGainsborough/Diocese of SouthwarkCamping out on the Pennine Way\n\nThe money raised will help to build new schools like St Cecilias School in Lupane, which is still under construction, but already offers an education to local children.\n\nSupport along the way included a video, on the fifth day, of the Bishop of Matabeleland, the Rt Revd Cleophas Lunga, outside the cathedral with members of the Mothers Union and senior clergy of his diocese, singing heartily of journeying with Jesus.\n\nBishop Lunga said: We are delighted that you are doing a very good, good thing, not only for your spirit and body, but also for us in Matabeleland. The gifts donated would go a long way to improving the lives of the young people in the villages, he said.\n\nOnline donations have since reached 27,000, with a further 8000 donated offline. The total raised currently stands at 35,389, and further donations are welcome.\n\nDr Gainsborough concluded: I have been amazed how my run has captured peoples imagination  reflected in a huge amount of support and prayers, and incredible generosity in fundraising.\n\nTo be able to make a difference to the lives of children in our link diocese of Matabeleland so they no longer have to walk long distances to school means more than I can say and makes all the pain and heartache worth it.

The passengers were travelling from Gokwe to Chimanimani.\n\nA day later, four people died and 17 were injured on the BinduraShamva Road when a Toyota Hiace tyre burst, sending the overloaded vehicle off the road.\n\nOther fatal crashes included a Toyota Hilux overturning on the MasvingoMbalabala Road on 11 August, killing two, and a ChechecheRimai Road tragedy in which a 16-year-old girl died after falling from a moving sand-laden lorry and being run over.\n\nPedestrians were also victims. In Harare, a man was killed on Delport Road in Hatfield on 12 August after being hit by a Toyota Spade, while another was injured on High Glen Road the previous day.\n\nDespite commending public service operators for cooperation during the period, police urged motorists to service vehicles, avoid speeding, and adhere strictly to road rules.\n\nAbove all, drivers should adhere to all road rules and regulations in order to curb the continuous loss of lives through road traffic accidents, Nyathi said.\n\n",
