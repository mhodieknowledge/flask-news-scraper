I survived because I could swim, he told the BBC.\n\nAnother resident, Saliu Sulaiman, said the floods had left him homeless and destroyed some of his cash business profits.\n\nI lost at least $1,500 to the floods. It was the proceeds from the sale of my farm produce the previous day. I contemplated going back into the room to get it, but the pressure of the water scared me.\n\nSome local residents have said that the flooding was so devastating because a nearby dam had burst, however the authorities have not confirmed this.\n\nOn Sunday, the National Emergency Management Agency (Nema) announced it had started the process of providing relief packages to people affected.\n\nThe agencyadded in a post on Facebookthat roads and bridges were also affected by the flood, which has had a knock-on effect on the local economy and traffic.\n\nThe Nigerian Red Cross alsoreleased a statement on Fridaysaying the floods had caused significant loss of life and widespread distress.\n\nFloods are not uncommon during the Nigerian rainy season, which lasts from April until October.\n\nIn 2024, Nigeria experienced flooding from heavy rain which caused deaths and drove people from their homes.\n\nThere was also severe flooding in 2022, when more than 600 people died and 1.3 million were displaced.\n\n",
