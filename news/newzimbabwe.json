            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Tawanda Chitapi has dismissed an urgent chamber application by Yadah Stars owner Walter Magaya who was challenging his disqualification from theZIFA Presidential race set for January 25.\n\nChitapi ruled that Magayas application lacked merit.\n\nMagaya was arguing that his disqualification by the ZIFA electoral committee for failing to submit his Ordinary Certificate was grossly unreasonable.\n\nHe also argued that the failure of the committee to consider his tertiary qualifications as mandated by ZIFA statutes, being diplomas from UNISA was unreasonable and defied logic.\n\nMagaya submitted higher certificatesin Marketing andTheology.\n\nThe cleric also said the committee erred by failing to communicate in writing that further qualifications were required to meet the necessary criteria.\n\nThe judge said that the bone of contention was the fact that part of the requirements listed in ZIFA statutes was the issue of equivalent education qualifications.\n\nSimply put, the applicant contends that although he did not submit OLevel qualifications he still met the requirements and would have qualified, the judge noted.\n\nMagaya submitted that he was over-qualified having submitted higher tertiary qualifications.\n\nHe said the committee disregarded the fact they were supposed to have written him within seven days of his disqualification to inform him that further documents were required.\n\nHe also said there were no appeal structures within ZIFA.\n\nThe respondents argued that Magaya erred by failing to cite the ZIFAEthics Committee which disqualified him.\n\nLovemore Madhuku representing the respondents also said Magaya should have cited the motherboard, ZIFA.\n\nIt is common cause that Zifa operates through the Normalisation Committee which is chaired by the first respondent (Lincoln Mutasa).\n\nThe respondents objected to the jurisdiction of this court to entertain the matter. The objection was pointless.\n\nThe objection has no substance.\n\nHe said if ZIFAdecides not to take its disputes to court it does not mean that the High Court has no jurisdiction.\n\nIt is public knowledge that the court has dealt with many football cases in its history. It is shocking that ZIFA raised this point. If this objection was meant to test the watersthen the waters are still the same, Chitapi said.\n\nThe relief sought is setting aside the disqualification of the applicant.\n\nIt is my view that the applicant needs to be candid and take the court into his confidence.\n\nAt least this court should have an insight into matters the applicant needed the court to interrogate over his disqualification.\n\nChitapi said if this was done, his court had powers to review the committees decision and advise what was appropriate.\n\nIn casu the question remains, if the decision is set aside, what else other than that submitted before the committee would be placed before the committee to show that the applicant qualified.\n\nHe does not give any hint on what he intends to submit before the committee if the decision is set aside.\n\nThe point is this. He was disqualified in a process in which he impugns. He must show that this process was flawed.\n\nI accept that the minimum was a pass with five O Levels. What is correct is that OLevel involves a study of OLevel Curriculum.\n\nA requirement to have five OLevels must be met.\n\nJust for the avoidance of doubt, if one relies on a diploma, the issue is not that a Diploma is higher than OLevel. The applicant would be required to produce an OLevel certificate even if he holds a PhD.\n\nIn the present matter, the applicant has been coy in disclosing further information regarding his qualifications to correct the committees decision.\n\nChitapi said the court cannot simply set aside a decision when there is no supporting evidence to challenge that decision.\n\nThere was nothing grossly irregular in reaching the decision by the vetting committee accordingly, the challenge by the applicant cannot succeed.\n\nHis application is dismissed. Each party to be its costs.\n\n",

            "content": "By Nqoba MSibenke\n\nThe turnout of people seeking mental health services in Zimbabwe is generally low and in previous years this was attributed to few service providers this might not be the case now. There has been an increase in mental health awareness programs nationwide post-COVID due to the increased number of mental health issues. In this article, we will discuss the role of Psychologists in mental health and answer some critical questions which may help in debunking some myths concerning psychotherapy.\n\nAccording to the Health Professions Act 27:1,9, a Psychologist is a person who has trained and registered with the Allied Health Professions Council of Zimbabwe. In addition to registration, the individual should have a valid practising license. The general requirements for one to be registered as a Psychologist are a Bachelor of Science Honors Degree in Psychology and a Masters in Psychology with a specialization in the area they wish to practice in and completion of one years internship.\n\nThere are many divisions of Psychologists, in Zimbabwe the following are recognized, clinical, counselling, forensic, neuro, educational, occupational, community, child and research psychology. Psychologists are required to practice within their scope of registration. This means a Forensic Psychologist cannot practice as an Educational Psychologist or vice versa. The Psychology profession is regulated by the Allied Health Professions Council of Zimbabwe which in turn reports to the Health Professions Authority.\n\nWhat is the work of Psychologists?\n\nPsychologists perform assessment, diagnosis and intervention for mental health issues. The application of these duties differs across different divisions, for example, clinical practice deals with clients dealing with developmental issues, mental health issues, and psychopathology, and forensic practice involves the application of psychological interventions within the forensic setup. This involves clients who need assessments for legal issues.\n\nWhen should I seek the services of a Psychologist?\n\nIf youre struggling with emotional distress, mental health concerns, relationship issues, trauma, coping with change, self-esteem and confidence, addiction, academic or career concerns, sleep disturbances, or coping with chronic illness, consider seeking help from a psychologist. General practitioners may also refer you to a psychologist when they feel you require their services.\n\nMyths about Psychologists\n\nA common myth about Psychologists is that they read peoples minds. This is informed mostly by the media, especially movies. However, this is not true. Psychologists may infer what one is thinking based on an analysis of behavioural patterns.\n\nPsychologists are said to deal with crazy people. This is not true. This is not entirely true as psychologists deal with people who have a wide range of issues ranging from relationships to emotional as well as mental psychopathology.\n\nSome people believe that Psychologists fix people or fix their problems. This is a great undersight as Psychologists work with the client to identify their hopes and goals. They then work together with the client to achieve their goals. This is done through the aid of psychological therapies The focus is on empowering the client to be able to cope with their problems.\n\nWhats the difference between a Psychologist and a Counselor?\n\nPsychologists and counsellors share many similarities, but they also have some key differences. Both professionals work in the field of mental health, aiming to help individuals, couples, families, or groups cope with mental health issues. They employ various therapeutic techniques, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy, psychodynamic therapy, and humanistic therapy, to help clients manage their mental health. However, there are also significant differences between psychologists and counsellors. One key difference lies in their education and training. A key difference is that psychologists use psychological tests to assess and diagnose mental health issues. However, these professions are aligned and work closely together.\n\nWhere can I find a Psychologist?\n\nPsychologists can be found in private practice, mental health institutions like psychiatric hospitals as well as general hospitals. Remember that a Psychologist should possess both a registration and practising certificate to attend to you.\n\nNqoba Sibenke is a registered intern Counselling Psychologist and can be reached atnqoba.sibenke@icloud.com\n\n",

Mpofu is accused of misrepresenting his companys compliance with the regulatory requirements.\n\nMpofu allegedly submitted a bid security obtained on March 26 that had previously been used for an unsuccessful tender.\n\nHe is also accused of submitting audit documents purportedly prepared by three consultancy firms, which the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) found to be unregistered.\n\nIt is alleged that Mpofus company was awarded the contract, with the State claiming that Chimombe signed as a witness, leading to the duo receiving a partial payment of US$260,000.\n\n",

Despitethislarge workforce, the financial system of HCC is in shambles.\n\nHCC Executive Assistant to the Town Clerk, Mathew Marara, admitted before the Commission,chaired by retired Justice Maphios Cheda, that the workforceis excessively large.\n\nEven 300 is bloated. Yes, the percentage that goes towardssalaries each month exceeds the limits that are prescribedby the government, said Marara.\n\nRELATED:\n\nHCC is plaguedby allegations of bad governance and maladministration failing to carry out its mandate.\n\nThe situation is further exacerbated by City Council officials and Councillors who are influencing recruitment, inflating the wage bill at the Town House.\n\nWhat happens is when you come up with the structures for the organisation, departments recommend the number of personnel and type of personnel they require.\n\nThey recommend these to the human capital department and the human capital department writes reports to the Council to recommenda change in the structure of the organisation. It is the Council which authorises the structure which will be implemented, said Marara.\n\nHCC currently has more than 70 drivers responsible for refuse collection, but most of them are idle due to a shortage of vehicles.\n\nMarara said the only solutionis to reduce the number of workers at the HCC.\n\nCouncil needs to undergo a restructuring exercise but this restructuring can not be undertaken by the current council because on a number of occasions we had recommended reduction in numbers but it has not happened.

Her children saw what had happened.\n\nThe tragedy unfolded when she sought to reclaim her canvas sail, which the assailant had taken to cover his shack, said Mabhena.\n\nMabhena said he was disappointed that police had not arrested the assailant, being known to the community.\n\nThis barbaric act highlights the ongoing vulnerability and systemic injustices faced by migrants in South Africa.\n\nIt is deeply troubling that law enforcement has yet to act decisively.\n\nMabhena said foreign nationals in South Africa, especially those from other African countries, still face many challenges.\n\nMabhena said foreign nationals face challenges, including human rights abuses such as inadequate access to justice and health care.\n\nThe right to life, enshrined in the South African Constitution, is universal and must be upheld for everyone.\n\nYet, migrants often endure violence, neglect, and indifference from the justice system. This incident is not isolated  many crimes against migrants go unaddressed, dehumanising them and fostering a culture of impunity.\n\nMabhena said foreign nationals, especially those from the diaspora,contribute positively to the growth of the economyand have the same goals as South Africans.\n\nWe appeal to all people to reflect on their shared humanity. Migrants contribute to the growth and diversity of this society.\n\nViolence against any individual, irrespective of their nationality, violates the values of justice and dignity. We urge citizens and residents to unite against such atrocities and demand accountability from law enforcement and public institutions.\n\n",

            "content": "Business Report\n\nZimbabwean Finance Minister, Mthuli Ncube, is concerned that inward looking policies under newly inaugurated US President Donald Trump could result in higher inflation, elevated interest rates, and a stronger greenback, which could hurt emerging market currencies and capital flight as investors chase treasury bills.\n\nTrump is adopting policies that prioritise the United States interests. He has already signed Executive Orders withdrawing the US from the World Health Organisation (WHO) and limiting foreign aid, among others.\n\nEmerging market finance ministers meeting in Davos for the 2025 World Economic Forum (WEF) Annual Meetings are concerned that this could have implications for their economies and funding flows for critical sectors such as healthcare.\n\nNcube told a media briefing from Davos on Wednesday that he was concerned that higher interest rates and a stronger US dollar emanating from Trumps inward looking policies will hurt emerging market economies and currencies.\n\nHigher interest rates this will keep the USD stronger and we will not be comfortable if USD is too stronger. A strong USD may encourage imports too much which encourages current account deficits for countries like Zimbabwe, he said.\n\nFor emerging markets, explained Ncube, a stronger US dollar will suck liquidity away and hurt emerging market currencies and capital will exit from these economies in search of treasury bills.\n\nThe United States withdrawal from the WHO will likely result in limited funding flows for healthcare programs under the UN agency.\n\nNcube said Zimbabwe and other emerging markets now have to mobilise resources domestically to plug any funding gaps for healthcare.\n\nZimbabwe has implemented various taxes such as a sugar tax, levies on fast foods and on airtime top-ups in addition to an AIDS levy among others.\n\nResources from these statutory collections, said Ncube, would help the government to marshal domestic resources to fund health sector programs and importation of equipment used in cancer treatment.\n\nWe discussed what Trump means for global trade and international relations especially for Africa. One issue we noted was the US pulling out of the WHO  we felt that this perhaps signals reduced support on health front for countries such as Zimbabwe which relies on PEPFAR funding for HIV programs, said Ncube.\n\nThe withdrawal by US from the WHO means that Zimbabwe has to scale up our funding for health through taxes such as sugar taxes, and fast foods and sin taxes among others to fill the gap in any funding previously received.\n\nZimbabwe has however been battling a shrinking tax and revenue base due to economic difficulties that have resulted in the closure of companies and flight by international investors.\n\nCompanies such as Standard Chartered have recently divested from Zimbabwe while audit and accountancy firms have also been divesting, passing on operations to local management under new brands.\n\n",
