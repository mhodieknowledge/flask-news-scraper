He will, therefore, effectively serve eight years behind bars.Court heard that the offender would present fake identify documents, including a drivers licence, and forged proof of residence to car rental companies.Once in possession of the vehicles, he would quickly sell them to unsuspecting third parties, sometimes altering ownership documents to appear legitimate.It was heard in court that in all cases, the offender made initial rental payments, gained the trust of vehicle owners, and then vanished with the cars.Prosecutors said on October 22, 2024, Nketa hired a Honda Fit using a counterfeit national identity card and after some days, the car was tracked to Damafalls, where it had been sold. The buyer alerted police leading to the vehicles recovery by Criminal Investigations Department (CID) Vehicle Theft Squad Harare.On November 5, 2024, another car rental agency was duped into releasing a Toyota Axio.
