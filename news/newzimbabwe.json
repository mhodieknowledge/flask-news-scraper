            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo I IOL\n\nLIMPOPO police have launched a manhunt for a suspect after a 31-year-old Zimbabwean man was stabbed to death by another Zimbabwean national during an altercation at a tavern in Levubu.\n\nThe incident happened on Sunday, 28 September 2025, at about 17:30 along Levubu B Road. The victim sustained multiple stab wounds and was rushed to Tshilidzini Hospital, where he later died in the early hours of Saturday, 4 October.\n\nPolice have identified the suspect as Richard Chiraira, who fled the scene and remains on the run. The case, initially registered as attempted murder, has since been updated to murder.\n\nA manhunt is underway, and we are appealing to anyone with information to assist the police in locating the suspect, said provincial police spokesperson Colonel Malesela Ledwaba.\n\nInvestigations into the incident are ongoing.\n\nLast month, IOL reported that police in Limpopo launched an investigation into a suspected mob justice incident after the body of a man, believed to be a Zimbabwean national, was discovered in Mooihoek, Driekop. The victim, who is thought to be in his 30s, was found with severe injuries consistent with a brutal assault.\n\nPolice responded to a report of a murder, and on arrival, they discovered the mans body with multiple injuries, believed to have been inflicted with stones and bottles. Paramedics declared him dead at the scene.\n\nAt the time, police in the province confirmed that the motive for the killing was under investigation and appealed for the publics help.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has ordered Rockshade Car Rentals and Tours to refund the Methodist Church in Zimbabwe (MCZ) US$7,125 after failing to provide a 60-seater luxury bus as agreed, ruling that the company had repudiated the contract by offering an inferior vehicle.\n\nJustices Benjamin Chikowero and Happias Zhou dismissed the car hire firms appeal against a Magistrates Court ruling that found Rockshade had breached its contract with the church ahead of a scheduled trip to Botswana in April 2025.\n\nThe letter says it all, said the judges, referring to MCZs detailed complaint of 21 March 2025, which went unanswered by Rockshade.\n\nIt was never responded to. What this means is that the appellant never disputed the terms of the contract as spelt out by the respondent and never disputed breaching the contract.\n\nThe church had paid Rockshade for the hire of a new 60-seater bus to transport congregants to a seminar in Botswana.\n\nBut it later discovered the company only had a single 50-seater already hired out. Rockshade then offered an old 57-seater bus instead  a move that left the church with 60 confirmed travellers but only 57 seats.\n\nMCZ described the replacement bus as very old, with worn seats, a dirty fridge and toilet, and earmarked for scrapping. The court said this amounted to a clear breach.\n\nBy refusing to avail the 60-seater bus (having earlier misrepresented to the respondent that it had the bus), the appellant repudiated the contract, the judgment stated.\n\nThe respondent acted properly in suing for a refund the moment the appellant indicated its unwillingness to be bound by the terms of the contract.\n\nThe High Court partially allowed the appeal only to remove a Magistrates Court directive that the refund be paid within 24 hours, ruling instead that Rockshade must simply pay the money and costs of suit.\n\nAll other grounds of appeal are red herrings. Nothing turns on them,Chikowero ruled.\n\nEach party was ordered to bear its own costs of the appeal.\n\n",

Stay focused. Im fully aware of the huge responsibility and heavy burden upon my shoulders. And I will never let you down or fall short, Chamisa said.\n\nThe veteran politician-turned-advocate blamed his unnamed political foes, whom he accuses of attempting to arm-twist him into divulging information about his political strategy, almost two years after resigning from the CCC party presidency.\n\nBear in mind that not all strategic decisions are shared openly or with the opposite team. Information is a strategic resource never to be shared recklessly. As for you who believe and support; worry not, fear not, doubt not and more importantly, be confused not.\n\nIn his characteristic style, Chamisa reassured Zimbabweans that better days for the country lie ahead.\n\nBe clear and of good cheer. You will soon appreciate the wisdom of my ways. Victory and success never come cheap. Every action I take, every decision I make, is focused on achieving our great and glorious future for Zimbabwe.\n\nHe insisted that his focus remains on building Zimbabwe.\n\nMy hands are on the deck, my eyes on the vision and mission. The struggle continues, and I remain steadfast, fully committed to the work that cannot pause for idle distractions.\n\nIt is understood that Chamisa is working on a new and soon-to-be-launched political movement, a new vehicle for the 2028 elections, nearly two years after stepping down as CCC party President.\n\nThe opposition activist is also reportedly steering clear of commenting on Zanu-PFs internal succession battles.\n\nHe has been accused on social media of inaction as a politician and a leader that people expect to lead Zimbabwe.\n\nCritics have pointed to what they view as the clerics obsession with scripture, which they claim is the biggest weakness of the former Kuwadzana East MP as a leader.\n\n",
