A fresh Public Prosecutor and judge would likely provide a different perspective and ensure justice is served.\n\nThe dismissal of the case against Hosiah Chisango is a glaring example of the compromised judiciary, the infamous but true catch and release by law enforcement and the lack of accountability within the City of Harares procurement processes.\n\nChisango is one of many council officials arrested by ZACC and released by the courts in a never-ending series of catch and release.\n\nA lowly conviction rate of cases investigated by ZACC has seen it being tagged a toothless bulldog while its officials maintain the NPA lets them down.\n\n",

The delay in salary payments has caused financial hardship and discontent, as salaries are being eroded by inflation.\n\nThis has left our members incapacitated, which in turn affects service delivery. We urge the City of Harare to address these delays and ensure that workers are paid on time. Please note that employees have not been paid for December 2024 or January 2025, and February is already approaching.\n\nAccording to Statutory Instrument 13 of 2015, workers should be paid by the 28th of each month. We urge your office not to stagger salary payments and to pay all workers at once, as the current situation is causing disharmony in the workforce due to the instability of our local currency, read the letter.\n\nRELATED:\n\nThe workers grievances come amid an ongoing investigation by a Commission of Inquiry set up by President Emmerson Mnangagwa to examine operations at the Town House.\n\nThe Commission has uncovered widespread corruption within the City Council, with senior officials allegedly using it as a source of personal enrichment, which has negatively impacted service delivery in the capital.\n\nZIMNAWU further announced that its members would limit their working hours to two or three days per week to pressure the employer into addressing their concerns.\n\nIn light of the current situation, we have no choice but to declare that our members will only work two to three days per week until the employer resumes timely salary payments.\n\nThis decision is meant to safeguard the health, safety, and welfare of our employees, who can no longer afford to work under conditions that compromise their dignity and well-being, the letter concluded.\n\n",
