            "content": "By Monishka Govender l IOL\n\nTO CELEBRATE his 80th birthday on December 8, Prakash Harripersadh wants to conquer Mount Kilimanjaro.\n\nThe pensioner, from Redhill, Effingham, started mountaineering in 2005 at age 60.\n\nTo date, locally he has hiked Sani Pass (2 850m) 32 times, Chain Ladder (2 990m) four times, Rhino Peak (3 051m) five times, Bushmans Nek (2 360m) four times, Monks Cowl (3 234m) three times and Giants Cup (1 900m) five times.\n\nHis foreign achievements include climbing Mount Kilimanjaro (5 895m) in 2006, Mount Everest Base Camp (4 930m), Kala Pathar (5 545m), Mount Kenya (4 985m) in 2009, Thabana Ntlenyana (482m) in 2010, Aconcagua in South America (6 962m) in 2012, and Mount Elbrus in Russia (5 642m) in 2014.\n\nHe said his training and practice sessions were no easy feat at his age.\n\nI hike and walk in Durban every morning from 5am for 40km. I also get ready for mountain climbing by pitching a tent in the Drakensberg and Lesotho mountain ranges, and hiking by myself. In addition, I coach various individuals, who reached the Everest Base Camp and Kilimanjaro. This keeps me active, said Harripersadh.\n\nHe said his love for mountaineering started later in life because he did not have the funds to pursue his interest.\n\nI came from a poor home and took full responsibility for taking care of my family. When I turned 60, I realised I could do something for myself and that is when I chose mountain climbing. It was not easy but I have always been fit. My family was active. My father fought in WWII. I used to work in construction before I retired at 65, so Im healthy. I dont smoke or drink and am always on the move.\n\nHe said mountain climbing was not a cheap hobby.\n\nEven though I love mountain climbing, it is expensive, especially if you climb in other countries. The flights, gear and training adds up, so I look for sponsors most times. Ive decided to make Mount Kilimanjaro, which will be my last climb, is because its the only affordable one.\n\nThe grandfather of five said he loved nature, which was what was kept him going.\n\nNature is different. Its interesting and exploring the unknown has always been my passion. Im sad that I dont have people my age climbing with me. The oldest is usually 36 and when they see an older man like me, they tend to have an attitude because they think I will hold them back. However, they quickly realise I can handle myself. I dont get altitude sickness and thankfully, I have no illnesses so there is nothing that holds me back.\n\nHe said his wife, Navi (71), used to join him before she hurt her knee. He now travels alone.\n\nMy wife, who Ive been married to for 56 years, used to hike Drakensbergs mountains with me but had to stop after her surgery. Now I do everything alone. Even when I am climbing mountains in other countries, I will find a reputable company to take me. I hop on the flight on my own, get there, do my climb and then return home. Im used to doing the adventures on my own now.\n\nHarripersadh said this mountain climb would be his last.\n\nMy family, which includes my 4 children, have told me that I need to stop now. They want me to take a break and rest. I also feel it is my time to retire from mountain climbing. I did all I wanted and now I should enjoy the memories I have made, said Harripersadh.\n\n",

            "content": "By Xinhua\n\nA CHINA-aided agricultural demonstration village was officially launched last week in the Shamva District of Mashonaland Central Province, Zimbabwe, to enhance agricultural productivity among rural farmers.\n\nThe demonstration village, the second of its kind set up by a Chinese agricultural expert group in the southern African country, draws inspiration from Chinas experience in poverty alleviation and aims to assist local farmers in transitioning from subsistence farming to a business-oriented approach.Dozens of households are gaining hands-on experience in sustainable farming through advanced irrigation systems, high-yielding drought-resistant seed varieties, precision farming techniques to optimize output, and integrated livestock-crop systems, according to the expert group.Speaking at the launching ceremony of the demonstration village attended by Chinese and Zimbabwean officials and local villagers, Zimbabwean Deputy Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water, and Rural Development Vangelis Haritatos said the demonstration village highlights the shared vision for agricultural transformation between the two countries.Part of the demonstration villageThis project is a testament to the enduring friendship and strategic partnership between Zimbabwe and the Peoples Republic of China, rooted in mutual respect, shared prosperity, and a common vision for sustainable development, he said, adding that capacitating rural farmers is critical for rural revitalization efforts and ensuring community development in the face of climate change.The strategic importance of this demonstration village is that this project is not just another agricultural venture; it is a living laboratory of innovation, a bridge between traditional knowledge and modern technology, and a testament to South-South cooperation, said Haritatos.On his part, Chinese Ambassador to Zimbabwe Zhou Ding said the initiative deeply resonates with Chinas remarkable journey of development and poverty alleviation.We fully recognize that with over 60 percent of Zimbabwes population living in rural areas, it is essential to support the rural residents, especially those from marginalized and disadvantaged communities, in breaking the chains of poverty and unlocking their full potential, said Zhou.Beyond farming, the demonstration village also incorporates agro-processing facilities to add value and reduce post-harvest losses, training centers for skills transfer, renewable energy solutions, solar-powered cold storage, and processing units.Nomalisa Zindi, one of the beneficiaries, said the initiative has been pivotal in transforming subsistence farming into small businesses and creating self-sustainability.We are no longer begging or asking for something, but we are doing it for ourselves, knowing that we are working on something that will give us money for our pockets and the money to keep the project going, she said.\n\nThe demonstration village, the second of its kind set up by a Chinese agricultural expert group in the southern African country, draws inspiration from Chinas experience in poverty alleviation and aims to assist local farmers in transitioning from subsistence farming to a business-oriented approach.\n\nDozens of households are gaining hands-on experience in sustainable farming through advanced irrigation systems, high-yielding drought-resistant seed varieties, precision farming techniques to optimize output, and integrated livestock-crop systems, according to the expert group.Speaking at the launching ceremony of the demonstration village attended by Chinese and Zimbabwean officials and local villagers, Zimbabwean Deputy Minister of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water, and Rural Development Vangelis Haritatos said the demonstration village highlights the shared vision for agricultural transformation between the two countries.Part of the demonstration villageThis project is a testament to the enduring friendship and strategic partnership between Zimbabwe and the Peoples Republic of China, rooted in mutual respect, shared prosperity, and a common vision for sustainable development, he said, adding that capacitating rural farmers is critical for rural revitalization efforts and ensuring community development in the face of climate change.The strategic importance of this demonstration village is that this project is not just another agricultural venture;

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nUNTIL Friday last week, Ashel Chibutse, a 43-year-old man and his family of five were living in a four-roomed house at Cloverdale farm in Ruwa, 25 kilometres outside Harare.\n\nChibutse is among thousands of people who, on Friday, were left out in the cold after facing a heartbreaking ordeal when their homes were demolished.\n\nSeveral families, who had resided at Cloverdale after occupying the farm belonging to former Cabinet minister Petronella Kagonye, were brutally forced out.\n\nOnce homeowners, the Cloverdale farm inhabitants now face the harsh reality of homelessness amid the biting cold, with the Harare-Mutare highway becoming their temporary shelter.\n\nI was alerted earlier in the morning that houses were being demolished while I was at work. When I was near Ruwa, thats when I was told that Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) officers were beating people, said Chibutse.\n\nThe Cloverdale farm invasions began years ago when land barons linked to the ruling party, Zanu PF, sold stands to potential homeowners for as little as US$200.\n\nThe land was allocated to the home seekers, ostensibly for supporting the ruling party, with a Zanu PF member only identified as Chairman SaMutoko at the forefront.\n\nI got my stand in February and finished construction in six months. So since August, we have been living in Cloverdale. When we came here, we were told that the stands were being given to Zanu PF youths.\n\nWe were not given any papers. We were just told to go and see Chairman SaMutokohe would give you a piece of landand true to that, I was given a stand, said Chibutse.\n\nMany families woke up to find their homes being razed down by authorities.\n\nAs some tried to stop the demolition, violence erupted, with residents and ZRP officers clashing.\n\nPolice officers were beating anyone they came across. The beatings intensified when it was reported that some police officers had been killed. They were baying for the blood of all the men, and some were beaten thoroughly, said Chibutse.\n\nWhen NewZimbabwe.com visited Cloverdale, tension was high, with ZRP details swarming the area.\n\nThe evictees believe there was injustice in the manner the demolitions were carried out arguing there was no prior warning.\n\nWe were chased by police dogs. Now we have nowhere to go. Children who were supposed to go to school are in a difficult situation. We are now destitute, and we will live here until we find accommodation, said one Ndlovu.\n\nThe Harare-Mutare highway, where they now stay, is crowded and noisy. Cars and trucks pass by constantly, making life difficult for the familiesespecially the childrenas the relentless traffic has become a temporary soundtrack to their struggles.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner atMadzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal)to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima, this week we want to discuss the new law on carbon trading in Zimbabwe. What is carbon trading and may you give us background on this new law?\n\nVM: Thank you\n\nCarbon trading or emissions trading is a US$866 billion dollar global industry which involves the trading in credits or permits that represent the right to emit a certain amount of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases by companies or countries.\n\nThe government introduced on 2 May, 2025 the Carbon Trading (General) Regulations 2025 published as Statutory Instrument 48 of 2025 effectively replacing the 2023 instrument that regulated carbon trading. The regulations establish a legal framework for carbon trading in Zimbabwe.\n\nIn terms of background, our constitution guarantees every Zimbabwean to have an environment that is not harmful to health or wellbeing and a protected environment for present and future generations.\n\nZimbabwe as a signatory to the Paris Agreement and to an extent, the Kyoto Protocol, has an obligation to contribute to global climate change mitigation initiatives. That being said, our laws including the new statutory instrument introduced in accordance with the Environmental Management Act are structured to align to the global and local imperatives.\n\nReporter:What are the key issues brought in by these Carbon Trading Regulations?\n\nVM: I think of critical note is the coming in or creation of Zimbabwe Carbon Markets Authority (ZIMCA) whose mandate is to regulate, supervise and accredit participants in the carbon market and the Zimbabwe Carbon Registry for the issuance of carbon credits.\n\nIt therefore follows that the regulations have introduced mandatory registration of players involved in the carbon value chain. ZIMCA will therefore be responsible for the approval of carbon projects, monitoring compliance and authorizing the issuance of mitigation outcomes.\n\nThe regulations have maintained and introduced environmental and social safeguards through provisions for community consultation, monitoring of sustainable development, protection of biodiversity and local grievance mechanisms as a part of the consideration process.\n\nReporter: How will these regulations enhance the carbon credit market in Zimbabwe?\n\nVM: As a start, they introduce a uniform registry system and fiscal measures that will benefit the nation as a whole. The regulations require that credits be based on mitigation outcomes that are measurable and verifiable. The Zimbabwe Carbon Registry which I mentioned earlier will then operate a centralized digital platform recording the issuance, transfer and retirement of carbon credits.\n\nReporter: You mention national benefit, what benefits are likely to accrue to the nation?\n\nVM: There is a serious potential for financial inflows, if you take Gabon for instance, it signed a 10-year agreement valued at US$150 million in 2019 and received US$17 million the same year. Nigeria has the potential to make US$500 million per year from carbon trading. It is important to highlight that the two examples referred to have rainforests, however, there is significant upside of possibilities for our country, including the attended afforestation.\n\nThe regulations promote the use of local labour and infrastructural development creating jobs and decentralising economic development at the same time. Project promoters are tasked to commit 20% of revenue to community development which will likely benefit rural communities and of that 20% committed, half of is required to address essential services issues like water infrastructure, clean energy, health et cettera.\n\nIn terms of the fiscus, 30% of all proceeds from the issuance of carbon credits will be directed towards support of national development priorities through the Ministry of Finance. So the anticipated national benefit is huge.\n\nReporter: What measures are prescribed to ensure compliance?\n\nVM: Well, firstly, trading in carbon credits without a licence is an offence that may make one liable to a fine or prison for a period not exceeding 1 year.

            "content": "By Sinenhlanhla Masilela l IOL\n\nA 39-year-old Limpopo father together with his 36-year-old friend have been sentenced to life imprisonment for raping his two daughters.\n\nThe High Court in Polokwane convicted the duo on multiple charges including rape, sexual exploitation, and assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.\n\nThe girls, who were just nine and 11 years old at the time of the incidents in 2022, bravely testified against their biological father and his accomplice in a trial that revealed the deeply disturbing abuse they endured.\n\nNational Prosecuting Authority (NPA) regional spokesperson, Mashudu Malabi-Dzhangi, said another 68-year-old accused, Diedrick Schannes Roux, died by suicide after he shot himself shortly before trial commenced.\n\nMalabi-Dzhangi said the three men were renting farms around the Letsitele area.\n\nShe said the men pleaded not guilty to the charges except the two charges of assault with intent to cause grievous bodily harm.\n\nDuring the trial, State prosecutor Advocate Lerato Mohlaka called six witnesses including the young victims, who bravely testified in camera, shielded from the public eye.\n\nThey told the court that their biological parents are divorced, and the mother left them with their father. Around 2022, in Letsitele, their remedial teacher gave them homework to write her a letter about what made them happy or sad. This exercise ultimately exposed the brutal abuse they were subjected to at their home, explained Malabi-Dzhangi.\n\nThe girls also reported that they were raped on some occasions by Zimbabwean men employed by their father at the farm, after he failed to pay them their salaries. The Zimbabwean men are still at large.\n\nFollowing their conviction, the two men mitigated their sentences, arguing that the children were brainwashed hence they were implicating them.\n\nWhen arguing for life imprisonment, Mohlaka, argued that there were no substantial and compelling factors justifying a lesser sentence as the men have demonstrated no remorse, sympathy nor empathy towards the minor victims, for their barbaric and inhumane actions.\n\n",
