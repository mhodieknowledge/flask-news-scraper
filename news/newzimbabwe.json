All told, the ZDF will get over 700 vehicles, the first ever time that ZDF has received such a consignment within a short-time bracket, Charamba announced on his X account on Monday.\n\nThe timing has raised eyebrows, with many viewing the gesture as a clear coup-proofing strategy.\n\nCharamba defended the move, framing it as a fulfilment of service conditions for senior officers: The vehicles, which are part of the conditions of service for senior army officers, plug a gap in conditions of service for officers, some of whom had gone for a couple of years without a full set of their entitlements.\n\nHowever, he also revealed the allocation is structured as a loan. In public sector parlance, these vehicles are called personal issue service vehicles. What that means is that the vehicle is personal to the haver, who is also allowed to buy the vehicle after a stipulated time.\n\nThe development has already sparked public scrutiny, with critics demanding clarity on the source of funds and whether the purchase was accounted for in the 2025 national budget.\n\nObservers warn Zimbabwe is increasingly resembling a mafia-style economy where political elites distribute vehicles and perks like candy to loyalists and strategic allies in order to cling to power.\n\n",

This means that prices, as measured by the all-items ZWG Consumer Price Index (CPI), decreased by an average of 0.2% between August and September 2025, Zimstat said.\n\nFood and Non-Alcoholic Beverages recorded a month-on-month inflation rate of 0.2% in September, up from 0.1% in August. In contrast, non-food inflation fell to 0.5%, down from 0.6% in the previous month.\n\nYear-on-year, however, inflation remains elevated. The ZWG year-on-year inflation rate for September 2025 was 82.7%, meaning prices increased by an average of 82.7% compared to September 2024, Zimstat added.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has continued to pursue a tight monetary policy to safeguard the ZiG currency introduced in April 2024. This has included maintaining a high policy rate to curb speculative borrowing and anchor both inflation and exchange rate expectations.\n\nMeanwhile, Zimstat reported that US dollar inflation remained steady, with the September 2025 month-on-month rate unchanged at 0%, while year-on-year inflation stood at 13.4%.\n\nOn the poverty benchmarks, the Food Poverty Line (FPL) for one person in September was ZWG 877.03, while the Total Consumption Poverty Line (TCPL) stood at ZWG 1,292.80,the minimum needed per person to cover both food and non-food requirements.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has overturned a ruling that had awarded damages to six Rusape councillors who sued the town council for malicious prosecution, finding that the council never instigated their arrest and that their claims for legal fees and lost business were unsupported.\n\nJustices Sijabuliso Siziba and Isaac Muzenda allowed Rusape Town Councils appeal and dismissed the councillors claims, which had each been pegged at US$7,500.\n\nThe court a quo erred in finding the appellant liable for the delict of malicious prosecution, ruled Justice Siziba. There was no evidence that the council, as a legal persona, took a resolution to set the law in motion against the respondents. Without such resolution, the council cannot be said to have instigated prosecution.\n\nThe case stemmed from a 2020 tender row over the provision of legal services. The six councillors Lyton Sithole, Elizabeth Chidza, Joseph Nyamupera, Ndabaningi Mataga, Preference Chigwede and Peter Kwesha were arrested and charged by the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC) with criminal abuse of duty after the tender was cancelled.\n\nHowever, at their criminal trial, State witnesses, including then Acting Town Secretary Fansen Shuwa, cleared them of wrongdoing, testifying that they had not been part of the committee handling the tender. The councillors were acquitted at the close of the States case.\n\nIn 2023, the six sued the council for malicious prosecution, demanding US$40,000 collectively in damages. The magistrates court later awarded them each US$5,500 for legal fees and US$2,000 for lost business opportunities.\n\nThe High Court said those awards had no evidentiary basis.\n\nMalicious prosecution requires more than merely reporting a case to the police, Justice Siziba said. A party can only be found liable if it acted in a manner that tended to overbear on the police to institute proceedings which they would not otherwise commence. That was not the case here.\n\nThe court noted that ZACC had independently approached town officials and obtained statements while the councillors were away, with no council resolution authorising or directing such action.\n\nOn the issue of damages, the judges stressed that special damages must be strictly proven. No receipts were produced to show that any payment was made to lawyers, Justice Siziba wrote. It was a misdirection for the trial court to rely on the Law Society tariff in the absence of proof of actual payment.\n\nThe judges also dismissed the claims for lost business opportunities as unsubstantiated.\n\nThe councillors victory in the lower court has now been nullified. Rusape Town Council will not be liable for any damages.\n\nIn the result, we found merit in the appeal by the appellant and thereby upheld the appeal, the judgment concluded.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has revised the sentence of a commuter omnibus driver, ruling that a magistrate had gone too far in imposing a lifetime driving ban across all vehicle classes following a reckless driving conviction.\n\nRuzvidzo Freedom was convicted in June 2025 of reckless driving after he drove a Toyota Hiace kombi into oncoming traffic at the intersection of Second Street Extension and Upper East Road, Harare. Though no accident occurred, the trial court jailed him for two years and prohibited him from driving vehicles in classes 2, 4 and 5 for life, cancelling his licence entirely.\n\nOn automatic review, Justices Esther Muremba and Munamato Mutevedzi upheld the two-year mandatory jail term but blasted the blanket lifetime prohibition as a misdirection in law.\n\nThe trial magistrates decision to prohibit the accused from driving classes 2, 4, and 5 for life without distinguishing between the vehicle involved in the offence and other classes was therefore excessive and ultra vires, the judges ruled. Imposing a lifetime driving ban across all classes of motor vehicles on a first-time offender is a measure so severe that it should be reserved only for exceptional circumstances.\n\nThe court found that the magistrate had misapplied Section 53 of the Road Traffic Act, which provides escalating penalties based on repeat offences. For first-time offenders, the law prescribes a mandatory two-year minimum sentence plus a lifetime ban only from driving commuter omnibuses or heavy vehicles, not light motor vehicles.\n\nDriving against oncoming traffic signifies utter recklessness.\n\nBut apart from that, the magistrate must have noted that the offender was not involved in any accident, and there were no aggravating factors such as injury or damage. The degree of recklessness remained at the base of the recklessness ladder.\n\nThe High Court also warned magistrates against arbitrary prohibitions. A magistrate who plucks a prohibition from nowhere commits a gross irregularity which vitiates their decision.\n\nThe High Court reduced the lifetime ban to six months for light vehicles (Classes 4 and 5), while confirming that Freedom remains barred for life from driving commuter omnibuses (Class 2).\n\nHis licence was cancelled accordingly.\n\nThe judges ordered the trial magistrate to recall the offender from prison and formally advise him of the corrected sentence, ensuring the Registrar of Road Traffic Licences makes the proper amendments.\n\n",
