            "content": "By BBC News\n\nIRANIAN officials have expanded a ban on dog walking to a swathe of cities across the country, citing public order and health and safety concerns.\n\nThe ban  which mirrors a 2019 police order that barred dog walking in the capital, Tehran  has been extended to at least 18 other cities in the past week. Transporting dogs in vehicles has also been outlawed.Dog ownership has been frowned upon in Iran since the 1979 Islamic Revolution, with dogs viewed as unclean by authorities and a legacy of Western cultural influence.But despite efforts to discourage it, dog ownership is rising, particularly among young people, and it is viewed as a form of rebellion against the restrictive Iranian regime.Cities including Isfahan and Kerman have introduced bans in recent days, according to news agency AFP.An official from the western city of Ilam, where a ban was implemented on Sunday, said legal action would be taken against people who violated the new rules, according to local media.However, enforcing restrictions in the past has been patchy, while many dog owners continue to walk their dogs in public in Tehran and other parts of Iran.There is no national law that outrightly bans dog ownership, but prosecutors often issue local restrictions that are enforced by police.Dog walking is a threat to public health, peace and comfort, Abbas Najafi, prosecutor of the western city of Hamedan, told state newspaper Iran.Owners have sometimes been arrested and dogs confiscated for being walked in public.Many have taken to walking their dogs in secluded areas at night or driving them around to evade detection.Politicians in the Islamic regime regard pet ownership as un-Islamic. Many religious scholars view petting dogs or coming into contact with their saliva as najis or ritually impure.Irans supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has previously described dog ownership  other than for the purposes of herding, hunting and security  as reprehensible.In 2021, 75 lawmakers condemned dog ownership as a destructive social problem that could gradually change the Iranian and Islamic way of life.Irans Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance banned advertisements for pets or pet-related products in 2010  and in 2014 there was a drive in Parliament to fine and even flog dog-walkers, though the bill did not pass.Following the recent crackdown, critics argue the police should focus on public safety at a time of growing concern over violent crime, rather than targeting dog owners and restricting personal freedoms.Dog ownership, defying Irans mandatory hijab laws, attending underground parties and drinking alcohol have long been forms of quiet rebellion against Irans theocratic regime.\n\nThe ban  which mirrors a 2019 police order that barred dog walking in the capital, Tehran  has been extended to at least 18 other cities in the past week.

            "content": "By IOL Sport/ Agencies\n\nTHE power of the Comrades Marathon was on full display late on Sunday afternoon as runners scrambled across the finish line.\n\nWhile all the glory went to the winners who had finished earlier, those who crossed the line later were also proud of their achievements.One of the runners who crossed the line in a time of 09:53 was kwaito star Kabelo Mabalane of TKZee fame, who was running the Comrades for the 13th time.Speaking on the SuperSport broadcast at the finish line, Mabalane remarked on how tough the 2025 race was for him.It was the hardest one. I havent been here since 2019, so today proved to be very difficult. I stopped at 58 km. I quit as Id had enough, but my wife was amazing, and friends of mine [who were on the route] were very encouraging, Mabalane said.He found the strength to carry on, and along the way, crossed paths with Akhona Mkangala, who was also struggling.Akhona helped me to the finish line. We met on the route with 17 km to go. She was crying on the side of the road and I was like, Lets finish together, and ja, we made it. I didnt think Id be here.Despite a difficult run, Mkangala insisted the 2025 Comrades was not her last.Tough day in the office. It started off very well, but I started to struggle at Bill Rowan, but clearly Comrades has its own things. Its an unpredictable race, but well come back again next year, she added.Showing his appreciation for the race organisers, Mabalane said he was impressed by Sundays race, which finished at Peoples Park instead of the Kingsmead cricket ground.To the Comrades Marathon Association: You guys outdid yourselves. Its a spectacular race.Turning to the camera, he said: To you at home, you have to do Comrades at least once in your lifetime. Its going to change your life.Earlier in the day, Tete Dijana crossed the line in a time of five hours, 25 minutes 27 for his third Comrades Marathon title.Dijana out-duelled defending champion Piet Wiersma, to add to the titles he won in 2022 and 2023. Wiersma crossed the line (5:25:33) less than 10 seconds after Dijana. Nikolai Volkov was third in 5:29:42.In the womens race, Gerda Steym claimed a fourth title when she crossed the line in five hours, 51 and 19 seconds. The result confirmed her status as the dominant force in ultra marathon running in South Africa with her third consecutive title, her maiden win came in 2019.This years race had a record prize purse, too, totaling R7,605,000. Thats approximately $427,000 and nearly double last years R4,000,000 ($225,000). First-place finishers earned R874,000 ($49,150), prize money went 10 deep, and there was the potential for course record bonuses and hot spot primes on top of that too. Its certainly the richest prize in ultrarunning, but for comparison, the 2024 New York City Marathon had a total purse of almost $900,000.The Comrades Marathon is the oldest and largest ultramarathon in the world.Steyn was not only the public favorite but also the betting favorite. This years race had legal sports betting, and a day before the start, Steyn had 6-10 odds. Steyn set the down-run record in 2023 in 5:44:54 and, earlier in 2025, won the Two Oceans Marathon for the sixth time in a row.Steyn moved up over the next 5k, but the gap to race leader Mukoloma grew. The pacesetter Mukoloma was 47 seconds up 10k into the race. Dominika Stelmach (Poland) and 2022 winner Alexandra Morozova (Russia) trailed Steyn by 12 seconds in third and fourth. Standout marathoner Irvette van Zyl (South Africa) was sixth in her debut run, and 2024 third-place runner Courtney Olsen (U.S.) was 11th at this point.Mukoloma ran just behind the mens chase group through the Umlaas Road course high point at 20k. Two minutes behind her, Morozova pulled even with Steyn.On a long climb to the halfway point, 2:42 into the race, Steyn made the long-anticipated pass and moved into the lead. Steyn led at halfway, smiling and waving to the crowd, and Mukoloma quietly tucked in behind.

I never thought I would have to face this alone, especially with a child on the way, a teary Madenyika told NewZimbabwe.com, her voice trembling with grief.\n\nHer anguish is compounded by the financial burden of a funeral that is yet to be done.\n\nI dont know how I will manage, she said, her eyes filled with tears.\n\nWe were supposed to build a life together, and now it feels like everything has been taken away from me.\n\nMadenyika hopes that justice will be served with the weight of her loss heavy on her shoulders.\n\nIf the law doesnt take its course, we are pleading to citizens of Zimbabwe to help us find something to haunt the ones who took away his life, said Madenyika.\n\nElipa Jimu, the now deceaseds mother, is at pains to accept reality that her son is no more. Worse still, she cannot imagine the burden of taking care of her widowed daughter-in-law and her unborn child.\n\nI am in pain over my sons death; him and Melisa were the ones taking care of me.\n\nHe left a pregnant wife. I dont even know how I am going to take care of her. The preparation for the baby has not been bought yet. There even is no money for the funeral. I dont know where I am going to even get it. My son was supposed to bury me first, but it is me who is burying him, lamented Jimu\n\nTaurayi Chiedziso, a neighbour and friend, voiced his frustration over the tragedy.\n\nThis matter would have been resolved without even involving the police because we are neighbours, we are a community.\n\nNow, Blessed has died leaving behind his wife who is also pregnant. That child will grow without a father, its so heartbreaking, said Chiedziso.\n\n",

Upon detention, the now deceased was told by Ndavambi that he would return home in a coffin, a source told NewZimbabwe.com.The now deceaseds sister, Mellisa Manyepa was also victimised by assailant on the same day her brother was taken into custody. Her crime was allegedly harbouring a person on polices wanted list.Manyepa narrated events of the fateful day to NewZimbabwe.com.On 28 May I was informed about my brothers death and I was shown his body.We reported the matter to Police General Headquarters and Commissioner Paul Nyathi called Ruwa Police Station ordering the Officer-In-Charge to have Ndavambi arrested. But until now Ndavambi hasnt been arrested yet he always posts statuses on his WhatsApp.When I try to call him his phone says the number is not available meaning that he blocked my calls, said Manyepa.In a statement, the ZRP spokesperson Commissioner Paul Nyathi said Ndavambi will face justice for his deeds.Sadly, Constable Ndavambi disappeared as his arrest was imminent. He is currently on the run. Efforts to arrest him are underway for the law to take its course without fear or favour.The Commissioner-General of Police, Stephen Mutamba has made it clear that the law is the law and that no one will sweep this disturbing case under the carpet, police sais in the statement.Police will ensure that the suspect, Prince Ndavambis docket is swiftly concluded and presented to the court for prosecution. We are currently appealing for information which may lead to his location and subsequent arrest.He will face the full wrath of the law. The exact charge to be faced by Prince Ndavambi will be determined by the courts based on the police inquiry and full post-mortem results.Futhermore, the ZRP has filed two separate autopsies and have informed the deceaseds family to conduct theirs if not satisfied.Police has also noted with concern, conflicting reports on the post-mortem results. For the record, two post-mortem examinations have been conducted by Pathologist Doctor Guillen and Doctor Jabangwe. The Juruvenges family is still free to engage another independent pathologist of their own choice in line with the countrys laws, said Nyathi.As the investigations continue, the family is left in a limbo regarding Juruvenges final burial date.We are going to wait for the results before we bury him, though some family members are of the opinion we should sign the burial order. But if we sign, the matter will lose value and justice might delay, Manyepa told this publication.The family has since engaged human right lawyers to assist in the unfolding matter.\n\nConstable Prince Ndavambi is reported to have assaulted Believe Blessed Jaravange (30) at Ruwa Police Station until he died.\n\nThe incident followed Juruvenges arrest on May 27, 2025, following an altercation with a fellow resident, Mwazha/Maphosa, who reported him for assault and theft.

Lungelo Ndhlovu/Thomson Reuters Foundation.\n\nAround Hwange, last years drought dried up the boreholes and waterholes, threatening wildlife in the park and depriving people in Mabale of drinking water.\n\nAnd although rainfall from December to February this year was normal or above, fallout from the last drought persists.\n\nDespite this years rains, we had to close one of our boreholes, Mudima said, explaining how water table levels were still very low.\n\nBecause there are too many people in my village and not enough boreholes, people walk 5 km to a neighbouring village with a solar borehole, she said, referring to a borehole pumped by solar power.\n\nFaced with these recurrent water crises, people in Hwange have started building rainwater tanks, helped by the Soft Foot Alliance, a community-based trust registered in Zimbabwe.\n\nConstance Ndaba, 75, who lives in Masikili Village 2, said the tank harvesting system saves her walking 2 km to the next village.\n\nFor a family of seven, drinking water from the rainwater tank lasts us up to three months. Im not sure when I last went to fetch water from a borehole.\n\nConstance Ndaba poses next to a giant rainwater harvesting jar at her home in Masikili Village 2. The jar helps her family cope with water shortages when nearby boreholes and rivers run dry. 7 May 2025. Lungelo Ndhlovu/Thomson Reuters Foundation\n\nRainwater is collected in giant jars made by moulding canvas and chicken wire around sand. A thin cement plaster fixes the form, then the inside is plastered. The jars are placed near house walls to collect run-off from the roof.\n\nTheir simplicity makes for an easy upkeep  a key benefit in remote communities.\n\nWe use chicken wire, plain wire, four bags of cement and 24 buckets of river sand which is locally available. To build the jar tank takes four days and it can collect up to five drums of water, which can last up to three months, said Austin Nkomo, one of the builders of jar tanks based in Hwange.\n\nMsungwe Sithole, a creative facilitator at the Soft Foot Alliance, said the project aimed to build resilience to drought and help people live sustainably in a depleted landscape.\n\nErratic rains are not the only reason for water scarcity, said Chipo Mpofu-Zuze, manager for the Environmental Management Agency in the Matabeleland North province.\n\nMpofu-Zuze said deforestation, crop-growing along streams, poor farming methods, alien species invading wetlands and the release of effluent into local waters were also responsible.\n\nSimba Guzha, regional project manager with Voluntary Service Overseas (VSO) Zimbabwe, trains farmers to adapt to the increasingly hot and dry conditions.\n\nVSO is working with smallholders in the eastern provinces to improve productivity while safeguarding the environment  helping them stay safe from any shock drops in aid.\n\nMost of the farmers who have been trained on infiltration pits, earth dams, and rooftop water harvesting systems are now using these systems even without any foreign support, he said.\n\n",
