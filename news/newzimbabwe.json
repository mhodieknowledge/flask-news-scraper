The contractor was operating outside of ZETDCs jurisdiction and safety protocols, said the power utility.\n\nThe company urged the public to engage it directly for any electrical work involving its infrastructure so as to ensure compliance with safety standards.\n\nThe safety of our customers and the public remains our highest priority. We urge everyone to engage ZETDC for all electrical works on the electricity grid, added the statement.\n\n",

All I can say is that it was about time. We are so ready to show that women can definitely do it too. This platform is not just a performance; it is a statement that women belong at the forefront of our music scene, said Feli Nandi.\n\nThe concert, which is being hosted by Gateway Stream in collaboration with ZAR Events, will be held on 8 November.\n\nTamy Moyo said the concert will debunk industry stereotypes that have seen women playing second fiddle to their male counterparts.\n\nIt is powerful to stand among women who are rewriting the story of creativity. This show celebrates our strength, softness, and individuality. It reminds me that feminine expression deserves to take up space, unapologetically.\n\nMy set is inspired by womanhood. Its strength, vulnerability and rhythm. I want the audience to feel seen, to leave with hearts full and spirits lifted. Every song tells a piece of that shared story.\n\nWomen are no longer waiting for doors to open; we are building new ones. We are redefining leadership, style, and creativity with authenticity and power. The industry feels more honest because of it, said Moyo.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Emelia Muchawa has sentenced Harare nurse Bridget Makaza to 27 years in prison for the cold-blooded murder of her husband, Kurai Bus company owner Macloud Zvavovaviri Mapanga, whom she shot three times as he slept in their Strathaven home in 2018.\n\nMakaza was last week convicted of what the court described as a calculated act of vengeance fuelled by jealousy, polygamy and deceit. Justice Muchawa said Makaza executed her husband and then staged a fake robbery to conceal the crime.\n\nThe accused unlawfully and with intent to kill, executed her husband while he slept, ruled Justice Muchawa. She aimed at the upper part of his body and delivered three fatal shots, then staged an armed robbery to cover her tracks.\n\nWhen handing down the sentence, the judge said:\n\nWhereupon, after reading documents filed of record and hearing counsel, it is ordered that the offender who was found guilty of murder as defined in section 47 (1) of the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act [Chapter 9:23] is hereby sentenced to 27 (twenty-seven) years imprisonment.\n\nThe court heard Makaza used a .38 Amadeo Rossi revolver with an erased serial number, smuggled from South Africa under the pretext of buying medication. After killing her husband, she screamed Thief! Thief! and falsely claimed robbers had stolen US$12,000.\n\nProsecutor B. Murevanhema said, There were no robbers. There was no break-in. The story was a fabrication to mask premeditated murder.\n\nPolice investigations confirmed there were no signs of forced entry. The firearm and gloves were later recovered from a swamp in Belvedere after Makaza led detectives to the spot.\n\nMakaza fled to South Africa after being granted bail and was re-arrested in December 2024 upon returning to Zimbabwe, claiming she missed her children.\n\nDuring the trial, she claimed self-defence, alleging her husband tried to attack her, but the judge dismissed this as a lame and incredible fabrication. Forensic expert Admire Mutizwa testified that the revolver required deliberate trigger pressure and could not have discharged accidentally.\n\nJustice Muchawa concluded that Makaza procured the weapon, waited for her husband to sleep, and executed him in cold blood.\n\nShe was methodical, the judge said. Her conduct before, during, and after the murder shows beyond doubt that this was a planned execution.\n\n",

Greediness knows no boundaries, and this will lead to a huge disaster for the country.\n\nEarlier this week,IOL reported that Zanu PF has emboldened its move to push through a proposal allowing Mnangagwa to remain in powerbeyond his current constitutional term, which ends in 2028. The party recently adopted a resolution at its annual conference backing the extension to align with the governments so-called Vision 2030 development agenda.\n\nKasukuwere, once a senior figure in the Zanu PF government led by Robert Mugabe before going into exile during the 2017 military intervention, became one of the most prominent former insiders to condemn the partys Mnangagwa plan publicly.\n\nZanu-PF party has announced plans to begin the process of extendingMnangagwas term of officeby two years  a move that, if successful, would keep him in power until 2030.\n\nThe proposal was formally endorsed at the partys annual national peoples conference in the eastern city of Mutare over the weekend. Delegates instructed government structures to start work on legislation to amend the constitution.\n\nAccording to State-ownedThe Herald, delegates argued that the extension would allow Mnangagwa to complete ongoing national development programmes aligned with the governments Vision 2030 agenda.\n\nThe conference adopted the resolution unanimously, describing it as a step toward ensuring policy continuity and consolidating the gains made under Mnangagwas leadership.\n\nZanu-PFs acting political commissar, Munyaradzi Machacha, toldThe Heraldthat the resolution formed part of the official conference outcomes and would be referred to the partys central committee for consideration.\n\nOur president has demonstrated exceptional leadership in driving national development. The conference agreed he should be supported to continue implementing Vision 2030, Machacha said.\n\n",
