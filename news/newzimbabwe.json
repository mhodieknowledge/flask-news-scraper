            "content": "By Costa Nkomo\n\nThe latest Auditor Generals Report has once again raised flagrant breaches of Public Finance Management regulations, revealing that, as of June 2025, a staggering sum exceeding half a billion United States dollars paid by the Treasury to service providers on behalf of Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) in 2024 remains unaccounted for.\n\nThis substantial shortfall undermines fiscal transparency and accountability, principles crucial for sound governance.\n\nA key finding highlights a failure by MDAs to properly upload payment information onto the Public Finance Management System (PFMS). This omission creates a loophole that could facilitate embezzlement and corruption.\n\nThe report reads: Direct payments amounting to US$1,986,391,797 were made to service providers on behalf of the MDAs by Treasury during the 2024 financial year. However, MDAs accounted for US$1,388,673,713, leaving a balance of US$597,718,082 as at June 18, 2025. In some instances, the payments were not uploaded onto the PFMS. MDAs expenditure was understated by the direct payments.\n\nThis discrepancy represents a significant material misstatement of public accounts.\n\nThe failure to reconcile these payments points to a serious breakdown in internal controls, increasing the risk of fraudulent activity and illicit enrichment.\n\nThe report further details a five-month period of opacity during the currency transition from ZWL to ZWG between April and August 2024. MDAs reportedly operated outside the PFMS during this period, resulting in a vacuum of financial oversight.\n\nThere was a downtime of the Public Financial Management Systems (PFMS) during the country changeover of currency from ZWL$ to Zimbabwe Gold (ZWG) for almost five (5) months (April to August 2024). During that time most MDAs operated outside the PFMS.\n\nThe financial information that would have been processed outside the system was not uploaded onto the system in some cases. Such information would misstate expenditure figures.\n\nThis prolonged systems downtime created a black box scenario, leaving the door open for potentially unlawful financial transactions and making it incredibly difficult to trace the flow of public funds.\n\nMoreover, the Auditor Generals Report casts a spotlight on the widespread abuse of fuel allocations, noting a concerning increase in such incidents compared to 2023.\n\nPoor record-keeping practices and inadequate internal controls were identified as primary contributing factors.\n\nCases of loss of fuel were on the increase. These were attributed to control weaknesses in fuel management, ranging from non-maintenance of fuel registers, inconsistent fuel recordings, non-performance of fuel reconciliations, absence of segregation of duties and weak supervisory checks. In this report, seven (7) MDAs had issues with fuel management. Measures around fuel management should be enhanced, the report added.\n\nThe lack of robust fuel management procedures indicates a serious disregard for public assets, exposing them to potential misappropriation and wastage.\n\nSuch inefficiencies have a detrimental impact on service delivery and overall economic performance.\n\nSection 298 of the Constitution of Zimbabwe enshrines the principles of transparency and accountability within public finance management.\n\nThese findings from the Auditor Generals Report underscore the urgent need for enhanced oversight, stronger internal controls, and the rigorous enforcement of financial regulations to safeguard public funds and promote responsible fiscal governance.\n\nThe scale of the irregularities demands immediate and decisive action to hold those responsible to account and to prevent future occurrences.\n\n",

What happened to Nurse Muzuva is not an isolated incident; this is just a drop in the ocean.\n\nAcross Zimbabwe, many nurses are injured while carrying out their duties, some in ambulance accidents while escorting patients, others while lifting immobile patients in wards, Dongo said.\n\nAccording to the nurses association, many health workers get injured on duty and receive no support, treatment, nor compensation.\n\nMany are left to suffer silently in their homes, unable to afford care with the meagre salaries they earn.\n\nThis culture of abandonment is pushing nurses out of the public service and out of the country to search for greener pastures elsewhere.\n\nWe ask again: Who will care for the carers?

The park is a sanctuary where sculptors carve stone works of art inspired byanimalsand other natural forms. It, in turn is designed to protectnature. Indigenous native species have been planted there to help preserve them. Artist and park manager Nicholas Kadzungura explains that they are threatened bydeforestation.

Friend of the Rhino, a piece by the late Joseph Ndandarika, which encourages empathy and the protection ofendangered species. With only around 600 black rhinos left in Zimbabwe, the message is pressing. Marcey Mushore, the parks director, explains how animistic Shona traditions guide conservation efforts. The park also acts as agreen lungfor Hararesurban sprawl. Some 2.4 million people live in its metropolitan area and pollution and disappearing green spaces are a problem.\n\nChapungus artists are committed to sharing ancestral knowledge through sculpture workshops and educational programs. Kadzungura stresses that Zimbabwes traditional stone art is not just decorativeit carries lessons about coexistence with nature. Asclimate changeand urban development threaten the countrys wetlands andbiodiversity, the parks mission is becoming more vital.

This appears not to have been disputed by the respondent.\n\nThe chances of him securing alternative employment continue to diminish.\n\nRespondent, on the other hand, simply indicted that the applicant should not get more than 6 months worth of damages. Respondent did not suggest at what rate such damages should be calculated. After assessing the record, including the submissions, it is my considered view that the applicant is entitled to 12 months salary as damages in lieu of reinstatement.\n\nThe applicant is therefore entitled to the following according to his claim, ruled the judge.\n\nBusu, represented by labour lawyer Caleb Mucheche, claimed US$294,396.85 based on a gross monthly salary of US$1,192.00 as reflected in his April 2013 payslip.\n\nFidelity Life had offered damages equivalent to just six months salary, but the court rejected this.\n\nThe case was remitted to the Labour Court for quantification of damages by the Supreme Court under SC597/24, which had earlier confirmed Busus unlawful dismissal and ordered compensation in line with the Labour Act.\n\nBusu argued that he had made reasonable but unsuccessful efforts to secure alternative employment due to age and poor health.\n\nWhile he did not provide specific medical details, the court acknowledged that, at over 60 years old, his chances of re-employment were continuing to diminish.\n\nJustice Makamure cited precedent from Ambali v Bata Shoe Co Ltd 1999(1) ZLR 417 (S), emphasising that although dismissed employees have a duty to mitigate losses by seeking alternative work, employers cannot use that obligation to evade fair compensation.\n\nThe principle that it is the duty of the employer to prove that an employee made efforts to look for employment should not stop a dismissed employee from ensuring that they mitigate their loss, said the judge.\n\nThe breakdown of the court award includes 107 months salary of US$233,348.81, fuel allowance (150 litres/month for 107 months): US$24,075.00 and 12 months salary in lieu of reinstatement: US$14,304.00\n\nThe court ordered Fidelity Life Assurance and Fidelity Funeral Assurance to pay the amount or its equivalent in Zimbabwean dollars using the prevailing official exchange rate on the date of payment.\n\n",
