As a result, four people died on the spot, while 15 others were seriously injured, Nyathi said in a statement released on Monday.\n\nNyathi confirmed that the bodies of the deceased and the injured had been transported to Karoi District Hospital.\n\nThe bodies of the victims were taken to Karoi District Hospital mortuary for post-mortem examination and the injured were referred to the same hospital for treatment, he stated.\n\nIn a plea for road safety, Nyathi urged motorists to exercise caution and avoid overloading vehicles.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police implores motorists to exercise caution on the roads and avoid overloading vehicles to safeguard human lives, he said.\n\nThe accident has sparked outrage on social media, with many questioning how a Honda Fit, designed to carry a maximum of five people, could have been allowed to transport more than double its capacity.\n\nMuch of the anger has been directed at the police, with accusations of corruption and negligence levelled against law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe police are to blame here. That Honda Fit probably went through at least two or three roadblocks and because the police only focus on taking bribes they let such recklessness go unpunished. Secondly, most of the Honda Fits that pirate these routes belong to very same officers, wrote X user Davison Feliate.\n\nAnother X user, identified as Leeman, shared the same sentiment, condemning the police for their alleged failure to enforce traffic laws.\n\nPolice have no law enforcement officers. How can a Honda Fit carry 12 people? Leeman queried.\n\nThe tragic incident is a reminder of the concerns about road safety and the enforcement of traffic regulations in Zimbabwe, with overloading and unroadworthy vehicles continuing to make the headlines for bad reasons.\n\n",

The ground is also used by Division One clubs, further straining its capacity.\n\nWith midweek Castle Lager Premier Soccer League matches scheduled, Rufaro would have hosted six encounters in 11 days, excluding Northern Region Division One games.\n\nSpeaking at a recent council meeting at Town House, Harare Mayor Jacob Mafume expressed concerns that the stadium could be barred from hosting top-tier matches.\n\nTwo weeks is too long. The renovations must be done because the stadium is about to be condemned again, Mafume told councillors.\n\nShould Rufaro be condemned, Premier Soccer League (PSL) teams in Harare could be left in limbo unless the City Council acts swiftly to upgrade the facility.\n\nEarlier this year, the council announced a partnership with Scottland FC, owned by Mabvuku Member of Parliament Pedzai Scott Sakupwanya, to renovate the stadium.\n\nHowever, no notable improvements have been made since, dashing Mafumes hopes of the venue hosting international matches.\n\nThe installation of bucket seats, which Mafume had promised would be completed by mid-year, remains far behind schedule.\n\nInstallation of electronic turnstiles is yet to be completed. Rufaro stadium is still using an archaic scoreboard, another task on the hands of Mafume-led Council.\n\nRufaro Stadium reflects the broader decline of sports facilities under the Harare City Council (HCC), many of which are in deplorable condition.\n\nMafume told councillors he was tired of apologising for the state of council-owned facilities.\n\nThe state of City Sportslet us look at them. Every time, I have to apologise when I arrive at any council facility. It is not nice. The place does not look good, but there are simple things we should fix, said Mafume.\n\n",

            "content": "By Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThis story was originally published byGlobal Press Journal.\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  Blessing Mucharambeis uncle was just having lunch when he stood up, then collapsed. [He] started bleeding from the nose, she says, and died on the spot.\n\nAs far as his family knew, he had no health problems. As they struggled to make sense of the news, Chitungwiza Hospital  where his body had been taken to a mortuary  told them that a forensic postmortem would be required.\n\nZimbabwean law mandates postmortems for sudden or unexplained deaths, and public hospitals offer them for free. But there are only five qualified pathologists in Zimbabwe serving a population of close to 17 million people. The wait could stretch for days. And each day the funeral was delayed would add to the cost of hosting mourners, as some traditions require.\n\nA police officer stationed at the hospital offered them a workaround. Instead of a forensic postmortem, they could do a general one  an option when no foul play is suspected, and quicker since it doesnt require a specialist. But even that, he warned, could take days. He offered to fast-track the process for a US$30 fee. Desperate to bury their loved one, they paid.\n\nWe couldnt afford the time, Mucharambei says. We did it because we had no choice.\n\nPostmortem bribes are just one element of a health system  and state  in freefall.Hospitals across the country are plaguedby chronic underfunding, obsolete infrastructure and the mass emigration of medical professionals seeking better pay abroad. The government estimates that the country needs more than US$1.6 billion for its health sector to recover.\n\nUnderpaid and overstretched health workers have come to rely on informal payments as a means of survival, says Dr. Norman Matara, secretary general of the Zimbabwe Hospital Doctors Association. People are trying to survive. But over time, corruption becomes part of the culture.\n\nHe says its a common problem across hospital services, from the moment a patient is admitted.New mothers, for example, face extortionfor birth cards meant to be free. A 2021 study from Transparency International Zimbabwe surveyed over 1,000 people in Zimbabwe and found that 74% had been asked to pay a bribe while trying to access health care services.\n\nIn March, a nurses protest at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital  the largest referral hospital in the country  exposed how dire the situation is. It was the latest in a long history of strikes by health workers, who have repeatedly protested poor pay and deteriorating working conditions. But their actions are often met with intimidation. In June 2022, the government responded to a strike by passing a law banning health care workers from striking longer than 72 hours, with penalties of up to six months in jail for participants and organizers.\n\nA hospital corridor leads to the mortuary at Parirenyatwa Hospital. Zimbabwes public health system faces a severe shortage of pathologists, leading to postmortem delays and widespread bribery. Families say theyre often pressured to pay unofficial fees to expedite the process or obtain basic information about their loved ones.Photo credit: Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nPathology services are particularly strained, Matara says. The few available specialists are clustered in major hospitals, which creates opportunities for exploitation.\n\nFew medical students choose the career, and those who do face an uphill battle. Training programs are underfunded, mentorship is scarce and working conditions at public hospitals are dismal.\n\nBut this is partly a manufactured problem, says Memory, a nurse at Sally Mugabe Central Hospital, who asked to use her middle name for fear of losing her job. Memory has worked at the hospitals mortuary close to 20 years.\n\nThere isnt really a backlog but a fake one is created by police officers, the doctors and mortuary staff to pressure families into paying, she says.\n\nThese services are supposed to be easily available, she adds. A Cuban doctor performs the forensic postmortems on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, while the general ones are done daily. But families are often told there are delays. At times, they are asked to pay US$50 to skip it entirely, even when its required by law, or US$100 to expedite the process, Memory says.\n\nIts a moneymaking scheme at the expense of grieving people, she says.\n\nGlobal Press Journal reached out to Sally Mugabe Central Hospital for a response to these allegations. They declined to comment.\n\nTendai Terrence Mautsi, the public relations officer at Parirenyatwa Hospital, the largest public hospital in Zimbabwe, says there are occasional delays with forensic postmortem cases, mostly due to demand. The hospital, he says, has responded by increasing forensic postmortem days from two to three. Theyve also cut the average waiting time from up to two weeks to just three days. To address the national shortage, Mautsi says, the hospital has partnered with Cuban doctors to fill the skills gap.\n\nHe acknowledges that corruption has plagued the process. But, he says, its part of a much bigger unravelling, and everyone has become complicit.\n\nAt times you cant find evidence, he says. When you want to investigate it, the patient is complicit. The service provider is also complicit.\n\nIn the end, corruption harms people in need, says Tafadzwa Chikumbu, the executive director of Transparency International Zimbabwe. For those who cant afford to pay [a bribe], it means being left unattended, he says, which erodes the integrity of public institutions.\n\nThe solution, he says, is to make ethical conduct  including fair hiring and honest service delivery  the standard.\n\nEmily Muchabaiwa, in hat, Antonette Chisango and Keldon Muchabaiwa sit at their home in Harare. The sudden death of Emily Muchabaiwas brother  Chisangos husband  was marred by irregularities, including the absence of a written report and the lack of a clear explanation from medical staff.Photo credit: Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nPostmortem corruption means some families never find out what happened to their loved one. When Emily Muchabaiwas brother was found dead in Harares industrial area, his family was desperate for answers. The circumstances of his death werent clear, and the family hoped a postmortem at Parirenyatwa Hospital would offer closure.\n\nPer standard procedure, a medical doctor or the pathologist should explain the results to the family, Matara says. There should also be a written report. But it was a police officer who delivered the results, verbally, to Muchabaiwas family. There was no official report.\n\n[He] told us my brother had died from tuberculosis and a cold in the lungs, but he struggled to explain the medical terms. Prior to all this, my brother had no signs of sickness, she says.\n\nThe family was suspicious. Muchabaiwa says they believe the death involved foul play and the process was compromised. It would cost the family money to delay the funeral, so they buried her brother, who left behind a young son.\n\nWe had no choice, she says, voice trembling. The postmortem failed us. Corruption failed us.\n\nLinda Mujuruis a Reporter-in-Residence for Global Press Journal in Zimbabwe, where she covers foreign direct investment and its effects on local communities.
