            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nDISTURBED by the deadly Pit Bull Terrier dogs vicious and fatal attack of a Harare resident recently, legislators want the breed banned in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Pit Bull Terrier, commonly known as Pitbull, is an aggressive type of canine.\n\nMembers of Parliament (MPs) suggested to the Speaker Jacob Mudenda during a Question and Answer session this Wednesday that the dog breed known as Pitbull had become a threat to peoples lives as it is not wired to obey instructions like some of the breeds, hence, it should be banned in the country.\n\nThe call comes barely a fortnight after a man was mauled to death by the terrifying dogs in Bluff Hill, Harare.\n\nZanu PF Goromonzi West MP Biata Beatrice Karimatsenga- Nyamupinga raised concern over the pets-turned-killers.\n\nWhen moving in the bush we fear being killed by wild animals but when we are moving in the residential areas there are dogs such as the Pitbull.\n\nThe Pitbull is killing people. That dog does not listen to instructions from the owner. What is the government policy on the keeping of animals, in particular dogs like the Pitbull?\n\nResponding to the question, Justice Minister Ziyambi Ziyambi, who is also Leader of Government Business in Parliament, said the law, through councils, clearly stated that a dog owner should have a licence.\n\nThat law clearly states the number of dogs which are allowed in each and every household in towns. In other areas there are no dogs which are allowed.\n\nThat is why the individual who kept a Pitbull which killed someone was arrested. The police apprehended him because it was against the law. The Pitbull needs a licence which is different from other types of dogs because it is a very vicious dog, Ziyambi said.\n\nIn her supplementary question, Karimatsenga-Nyamupinga, however, disputed that the licence itself was not enough to stop such deadly attacks seen in the past week.\n\nShe highlighted that the Pitbull loses its memory, hence needs to be outlawed.\n\nYes, the licence can be there but we have that type of dog which loses its memory. What are we trying to say if we are allowing people to keep dogs which lose their memory? What are we trying to say about the lives of people? the MP stated.\n\nZiyambi told Mudenda that her question could only be responded to by the Veterinary Department, adding she should put the question in writing for further investigation from experts.\n\nThe government policy clearly indicates that for someone to keep dogs, they must be given a licence. If we want to go deeper on the types of licence and groups, it really needs to be written down so that we can go and consult the experts.\n\nIt will be easier for each and every individual in this august House and the rest of the country to understand the requirements needed to keep Pitbull dogs, Ziyambi explained.\n\nMudenda ordered the MP to put her question in writing, as it needed further clarification.\n\nChinhoyi MP Leslie Mhangwa added his weight to the conversation.\n\nlf we have somebody who has become a danger to the community, he is put in jail or put somewhere else.\n\nThe Pitbull as a breed has become a danger to the people of Zimbabwe. Is there anything that stops us from banning the breed within the country? I think this is the direction we need to move with.\n\nThe Speaker made a ruling that the question by Karimatsenga-Nyamupinga be put in writing and be dealt with next week.\n\nA Harare man, Samuel Machara was recently killed by Pitbulls owned by Mike Mupinga (40) of Bluff Hill in Harare, who was arrested and charged with culpable homicide.\n\nIn 2022, a Bulawayo man from Selborne suburb was also bitten to death by his own canines.\n\nTwelve countries in Europe, as well as Australia, Canada, some parts of the United States, Ecuador, Malaysia, New Zealand, Puerto Rico, Singapore, and Venezuela, have enacted some form of breed-specific legislation on Pitbull-type dogs, including American Pit Bull Terriers, ranging from outright bans to restrictions and conditions on ownership.\n\nSeveral states in Australia place restrictions on the breed, including mandatory sterilisation. Pitbulls are banned in the United Kingdom, in the Canadian province of Ontario, and in many locations in the United States.\n\n",

The president said he was a little disappointed about the fallout, but there were no hard feelings.I think he feels very badly that he said that, Trump said of Musks blistering social media barrage.The budget, which includes huge tax breaks and more defence spending, was passed by the House of Representatives last month and is now being considered by senators.Musk urged Americans to call their representatives in Washington to kill the bill as he believed it would cause a recession in the second half of the year.The tech entrepreneur claimed, without evidence, that Trump appears in unreleased government files linked to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nIn Filabusi, the streets are packed with BMW X5s and Land Rover Defenders, modern houses paid for in cash are springing up and whisky is only sold by the bottle in the small towns bars.\n\nThe three-year surge in gold prices, driven to a record this year as US President Donald Trumps trade war bolstered its allure as a safe-haven, is enriching the countrys more than 700,000 informal, or artisanal, miners. They are flocking to gold mining belts and throwing a lifeline to an economy thats been in economic turmoil since the turn of the century.\n\nIn the first five months of this year, those miners almost doubled the metal they delivered to a state refinery from a year earlier to more than 11 tons, swelling the countrys export income. At the current pace of production the country could earn a billion dollars more from gold shipments this year than in 2024.\n\nThe prices have been very favourable to the miners which is something we are so happy about, said Wellington Takavarasha, the president of Zimbabwe Artisanal and Small Scale for Sustainable Mining Council. This year is looking very good. We must capitalize on this rally.\n\nFor the about 4% of people living in Zimbabwe, and their dependents, who are involved in the gold mining its been a vital source of income. Formal employment has withered and millions of citizens have emigrated to South Africa, the UK and other countries in search of economic opportunities. For now, its their only hope and one that depends on the high prices holding.\n\nSo far, theres no sign that the rally will come to an end. The price of the metal has surged 22% since Trumps inauguration and is up by three-fifths since the beginning of last year. It hit a record of $3,432 an ounce on May 6 and Goldman Sachs forecast it will reach $3,700 by year end.\n\nThats pushed Zimbabwes central bank to paying cash for gold deliveries, targeting a record 40 tonnes of purchases this year after it earned $2.5 billion in 2024, a 37% jump from the year earlier. Artisanal producers supplied three-quarters of the metal delivered in April, whereas a few years ago the majority of their output would have been smuggled out of the country.\n\nBrighton Moyo with a newly acquired BMWbought from gold proceedsat a car wash in Filabusi (Zinyange Auntony)\n\nFor artisanal workers like Mxolisi Dube, clad in navy blue work overalls with a miners torch strapped to his head as he walks through Filabusi, the gold price rally has been a boon. The 33-year-old began mining for gold illegally in 2008.\n\nBut now with higher prices and the cooperation of mine owners, who have begun to invite artisanal workers onto their properties to boost production, his earnings have surged.\n\nYou are assured of getting something at the end of the month, said Dube, who has a copper dental filling and a brass chain around his neck. You are protected. If you are not under a company you always have to run away.\n\nMine owners, struggling with dilapidated equipment and a lack of finance, are increasingly urging those operators to swap the pans they used to sift through river sand for gold flecks for picks and shovels to help them extract as much gold ore to process as quickly as possible.\n\nThis means we always have ore available and are milling more, said Meli Nkulumo, plant manager at Macoomber 7 mine, which lies 12 miles west of Filabusi down winding dirt roads. Artisanal miners were invited onto the property two years ago.\n\nMeli Nkulumo, a metallurgist checks a website displaying gold prices at the Macoomber 7 mine (Zinyange Auntony)\n\nAt the mine, workers use Elon Musks Starlink internet service to compare the prices offered by the central bank to global benchmarks. Goldprice.org is their favored website.\n\nHigher gold prices are better for everyone, said Thulani Ndlovu, the acting mine manager. We can also look forward to a raise in salaries.\n\nStill, its backbreaking work thats carried out around the clock. The miners break up rocks underground with picks, shovel it into a loader which is then winched to the surface. During their eight-hour shifts their only sustenance is maheu, a drink made from fermented corn meal.\n\nBut for artisanal miners the price surge has been life-changing and nowhere is that more evident than in Bekezela, a suburb of Filabusi where property owners are busy putting up brick houses ringed by electric fences and equipped with water storage tanks and solar panels. The town council is having to rezone more land for residential and commercial use and at car washes 4x4s queue to have the dust of the surrounding savannah rinsed off.\n\nBar manager Thabo Mpofu says the gold boom has attracted big spenders and he now sells whisky by the bottle. (Zinyange Auntony)\n\nDrinking holes are busy with all sorts of people spending big, Thabo Mpofu, the manager of Next Generation bar, said, adding that he has seen clients buy bottles of Hennessey Cognac and pour them out on the ground as a show of wealth.\n\nIts also curbed crime including invasions of local mines by illegal operators. Theres nothing bad here that happens, said Melusi Nyoni, the manager of Fred and Fernando mines, which are on the outskirts of Filabusi town, He now allows artisanal miners to work in shafts as deep as a kilometer (0.6 miles). There is gold just all over, he said.\n\nMine manager Melusi Nyoni after visiting the underground tunnels (Zinyange Auntony)\n\nStill, with rudimentary equipment and limited safety protocols, digging up the ore is dangerous work.\n\nGold miners at work in an underground tunnel at the Fred & Fernando mines.Photographer: Zinyange Auntony/Bloomberg\n\nInformal miners accounted for 87% of the 186 deaths in Zimbabwean mining accidents, the Chamber of Mines said in its last annual report. As recently as late May, four died at a mine near Chegutu in northern Zimbabwe when a wall of earth collapsed onto them, according to local media reports.\n\nBut as long as the rally lasts, thats little deterrence for artisanal miners who, until recently, were eking out a livingby camping out and panning for gold in remote wild areas for several months.\n\nThe high prices mean in the near future I will also be seen in a car, says Dube, a father of four. I want a Toyota Hilux 44, with a 2.7-litre engine.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/a-brief-overview-of-the-regulation-of-dogs-in-zimbabwe/",
            "content": "By Mlondolozi Ndlovu\n\nLast week, Zimbabwe was once again confronted with the tragic consequences of dog attacks when a man was fatally mauled by a pit bull in Harare.\n\nThe dog was later euthanised, and the owner was arrested and charged with culpable homicide.\n\nThat incident has brought national attention to the gaps in how the country regulates the keeping of dangerous dogs and handles accountability when they cause harm.\n\nDrawing from that tragic event, attention now turns to the laws that govern dog ownership, the responsibilities they place on owners, the nature of liability when attacks occur, and what more can be done legally and structurally to reduce the frequency and severity of dog attacks in Zimbabwe.\n\nThe Legal Framework on Dog Ownership\n\nZimbabwe does not have a single unified Dog Act. Instead, various laws and bylaws touch on aspects, ranging from animal welfare and disease control to criminal liability and public safety.\n\nThe key statutory instruments include- the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act [Chapter 19:09, the Animal Health Act [Chapter 19:01], the Criminal Law (Codification and Reform) Act [Chapter 9:23] and the Municipal bylaws (e.g. those from City of Harare, Bulawayo etc.)\n\nEach of these pieces of legislation contributes a specific layer of regulation, but there is no comprehensive framework dealing specifically and adequately with the challenges posed by keeping aggressive or potentially dangerous dogs in residential or public areas.\n\nUnder Section 3 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, dog owners are legally obligated to prevent cruelty, suffering, neglect, or terror being caused to an animal.\n\nThe law imposes a duty on every owner to exercise reasonable care and supervision over their animals. Importantly, an owner can be prosecuted not only for acts of cruelty but also for omissions, such as failing to secure a dog properly, that result in harm.\n\nThe Animal Health Act, on the other hand, provides the government with powers to regulate the keeping, movement, and control of animals, especially where disease transmission or public safety is concerned.\n\nIn terms of Section 5, the Minister of Agriculture may impose restrictions to establish a licensing system for domestic animals, including dogs. However, these provisions are more often invoked in the context of livestock and zoonotic diseases, not urban attacks.\n\nLocal authorities may also enact bylaws to govern dog licensing, lease requirements, noise control, and maximum numbers per household. However, in practice, many municipalities fail to enforce these rules, and the public is often unaware of their obligations.\n\nThus, Zimbabwe does have scattered legal provisions, but these are fragmented, poorly enforced and outdated relative to the scale and seriousness of dog attacks in recent years.\n\nOne of the key questions in cases of dog attacks is Who is legally responsible when a dog bites, injures, or kills someone? In Zimbabwean law, the answer largely centers on the owner or the person in control of the dog at the time of the incident.\n\nThe Criminal Code contains several provisions relevant to dog-related injuries and deaths.\n\nAccording to Section 89, if a person commands or intentionally causes a dog to attack another, they can be charged with assault via indirect application of force.\n\nSection 90 provides that any person who, by any act whatsoever, causes serious bodily harm to another person, negligently failing to realise that serious bodily harm may result from his or her conduct or negligently failing to guard against that possibility, shall be guilty of negligently causing serious bodily harm.\n\nIf someone negligently allows their dog to injure another person, this offence applies.\n\nSection 49 (Culpable Homicide) provides that where negligence results in death, such as failing to confine a known aggressive dog, a person can be charged with culpable homicide.\n\nThese provisions make it clear that owners bear criminal responsibility for their dogs actions, especially where the owners conduct falls below the legal standard of reasonable care.\n\nIn addition to criminal charges, victims or their families may pursue delictual claims against dog owners. This includes claims for pain and suffering, medical bills or funeral expenses, loss of income or support and emotional trauma.\n\nThis is known as pauperian action or action de pauperise. It involves an action arising out of harm caused by domestic animals. It is based on the notion that an owner is strictly liable for the harm that the animal causes to another person. In order to succeed in such a claim, one should prove;\n\ni. That the Defendant was the owner of the animal when damage was inflicted\n\nii. That the animal which inflicted the damage is a domestic animal\n\niii. That the Plaintiff was lawfully present at the location where the damage was inflicted\n\niv. That the animal acted contra naturam sui generis, that is to say, contrary to its nature or class.\n\nFrom an objective point of view, the animal must have acted contrary to what may be expected of a decent and well-behaved animal of its kind.\n\nv. The animal must have caused the damage spontaneously from an inward excitement or vice, that is to say, without provocation.\n\nThe growing number of fatal dog attacks, many involving pit bulls, boerboels, and crossbreeds, suggests that current laws are no longer sufficient to deal with the real dangers of unregulated dog ownership.\n\nNotable recent attacks include the March 2023 Whitecliffe incident, where a 9-year-old was killed by a boerboel, the August 2022 Matshemhlophe attack, where two boerboels killed a 6-year-old girl and the May 2022 Selbourne Park case, where a man was fatally attacked by his own dogs.\n\nThe examples, among others, demonstrate that dog attacks are not isolated events. They are a pattern, especially involving large, aggressive breeds in urban and peri-urban settings.\n\nThe combination of weak fencing, lack of training, absence of licensing, and community inaction often leads to predictable, preventable tragedies.\n\n1. Mandatory Licensing and Registration\n\nAll dogs, especially aggressive breeds such as pit bulls, boerboels, and rottweilers, should be subject to a compulsory licensing and microchipping system. Owners must register their dogs with municipal authorities and renew the license annually. This would improve traceability and make it easier to hold owners accountable.\n\n2. Breed-Specific Regulation\n\nWhile some are calling for a total ban on pit bulls, a more effective solution is tight breed-specific regulation. Outright bans are often difficult to enforce and may drive ownership underground. Instead, the following can be done-require muzzling and leashing in public spaces, impose ownership restrictions e.g. no ownership by persons under 21 and require special permits for keeping aggressive breeds, contingent on proof of secure fencing, dog training and insurance.\n\n3. Minimum Housing and Confinement Standards\n\nLegislation should prescribe minimum standards for secure fencing and enclosures for households keeping large or aggressive dogs. These standards should be enforceable through random inspections and backed by municipal fines.\n\n4. Mandatory Insurance\n\nOwners of aggressive breeds should be required to carry third-party liability insurance to cover injury or death caused by their dogs. This protects both the victims and the financial stability of owners.\n\n5. Licensing of Dog Sellers and Crackdown on Illegal Sales\n\nA critical but often overlooked factor contributing to dog attacks is the unregulated sale of dangerous breeds. Many of these high-risk dogs are sold informally through the black market.\n\nThis means individuals without the necessary capacity, training, or housing standards can easily acquire dogs that require expert handling.\n\nEvery person or business selling dogs, particularly aggressive breeds, should be licensed by the local authority or veterinary board. Selling dogs without a license should be criminalised with clear penalties, including fines and imprisonment.\n\nLicensing requirements should include proof of veterinary inspection, proper breeding and socialisation practices and verification that buyers meet the legal criteria for ownership.\n\nCracking down on illegal dog sales would prevent untrained individuals from owning powerful breeds, thereby reducing the risks of abuse, neglect and eventual attacks.\n\nIn summation, dog attacks in Zimbabwe are no longer isolated tragedies; they reflect a deeper problem rooted in weak regulation, poor enforcement, and a widespread lack of accountability among dog owners and sellers.\n\nAlthough legal provisions such as the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, the Animal Health Act, and the Criminal Code assign liability to dog owners, they are fragmented, reactive, and under-enforced.\n\nThe absence of breed-specific regulations, enforceable confinement standards, licensing of sellers, and a clear system for early intervention continues to put the public at risk.\n\nPreventing future attacks requires a fundamental shift. Dog ownership, especially of aggressive breeds, must be treated as a regulated responsibility, not a causal entitlement.\n\nOwners must be held civilly and criminally accountable, illegal dog sellers must face penalties, and municipalities must be empowered to enforce minimum housing, licensing and training standards.\n\nA comprehensive, proactive legal framework, backed by enforcement and public cooperation, is the only sustainable path forward. The law must evolve, not only to punish after loss, but to protect before it happens again.\n\nMlondolozi Ndlovu is a Zimbabwean journalist who is also a media lecturer, legal and media researcher.
