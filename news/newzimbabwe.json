            "content": "By Annah Chibamu\n\nZANU PF MP and Parliaments Budget and Finance committee chairperson, Energy Mutodi has made a somersault over bribery allegations he levelled against Finance Permanent Secretary George Guvamatanga.\n\nEarlier, Mutodi made sensational claims against the Treasury head but suddenly, made a U-turn, apologising and retracting the statements.The legislator demanded that Guvamatanga be summoned by Parliament to clear his name following accusations of corruption involving alarming sums in dealings with contractors.In the X thread, the former deputy minister had accused Guvamatanga of siphoning millions of US dollars from State coffers through government contracted companies of between five and 10% per transaction or contract.The Parliament of Zimbabwe has received agonising reports that Guvamatanga is receiving 5% -10% for every payment done by the Treasury. GG as he is notoriously called has accumulated more than US$1 billion becoming the richest civil servant, said Mutodi.Finance Ministry Permanent Secretary George GuvamatangaHe alleged Contractors, Ministries and Departments refusing to pay Guvamatanga a kick back of at least 5% after receiving Treasury payments have been denied payments for several months even if the funds are budgeted for.Over the past six months, Parliament itself has struggled to operate after being denied its budgeted funds by George Guvamatanga. A civil servant earning less than $1,000 GG has more than 5,000 dairy cattle, dairy equipment and several mansions hence the proposed lifestyle audit.In a statement, Mutodi retracted the damning charges saying he had no iota of evidence to prove these allegations.This is not the first time the controversial lawmaker has made baseless allegations and forced to withdraw through lack of evidence.Following the publication of several tweets concerning flaws in the government payment system and particularly the conduct of Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion Mr George Guvamatanga,I have reflected on my relationship with the Permanent Secretary anc following a telephone conversation with him, I have concluded that it is not in our interest to escalate the issues raised in those tweets.While the issues had been raised as a matter of principle and for the need to contribute meaningfully to this government especially by upholding the oversight function of Parliament provided for under Section 119 (3) of the Constitution of Zimbabwe, it is apparent to mention that proof beyond reasonable doubt under the circumstances would be impossible, making such a publication defamatory on the part of Mr George Guvamatanga.I, therefore, wish to issue an apology, unreservedly to Mr George Guvamatanga for the reputational damage the tweets may have caused and I have made instructions that the tweets be erased with immediate effect, Mutodi said.Mutodi will have to appear in Parliament to retract the allegations against Guvamatanga, which were also recorded in the parliamentary journal, The Hansard, this Thursday.\n\nEarlier, Mutodi made sensational claims against the Treasury head but suddenly, made a U-turn, apologising and retracting the statements.\n\nThe legislator demanded that Guvamatanga be summoned by Parliament to clear his name following accusations of corruption involving alarming sums in dealings with contractors.In the X thread, the former deputy minister had accused Guvamatanga of siphoning millions of US dollars from State coffers through government contracted companies of between five and 10% per transaction or contract.The Parliament of Zimbabwe has received agonising reports that Guvamatanga is receiving 5% -10% for every payment done by the Treasury.

It also suggested simplifying the Zimbabwean dollars exchange rate system, which it believes is inconsistent with a floating rate.However, the RBZ disagreed, asserting that its current approach provides essential flexibility for stabilizing the currency and strengthening reserves. The central bank emphasized that its involvement in the FX market is necessary to maintain exchange rate stability and questioned the IMFs recommendation to reduce its role.On broader monetary policy, the IMF proposed phasing out Non-Negotiable Certificates of Deposit (NNCDs) and replacing them with tradable securities to improve liquidity management. The RBZ responded by outlining plans to reduce reliance on direct monetary tools and improve policy transmission, including the introduction of a Term Deposit Facility.Additionally, the RBZ rejected IMF claims about exchange rate restrictions, stating that recent reforms have removed all formal restrictions and any remaining measures are internal procedures by financial institutions, not government-imposed.Despite the disagreements, the RBZ expressed openness to future adjustments, such as enhancing the FX market with greater transparency and exploring IMF technical assistance.The central bank also reaffirmed its commitment to price stability and long-term reforms, with plans to transition to a mono-currency system by 2030.\n\nTHE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has defended its monetary policy and the new Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency framework in response to criticism from the International Monetary Fund (IMF).\n\nThe IMFs August 2025 review of Zimbabwes economic performance praised the RBZs tight monetary policy for stabilising the ZiG and controlling inflation, but called for an overhaul of the countrys foreign exchange (FX) management system.The IMF recommended reducing the RBZs involvement in the FX market, specifically lowering the mandatory 30% export surrender requirement and transitioning to a more market-driven approach.

Attendees said that children as young as 13-years-old are being trapped in cycles of drug abuse, early marriages, and social instability  problems they believe are being worsened by the lack of mental health support.Speakers strongly condemned what they described as rampant corruption at the highest levels of government. Several participants accused President Emmerson Mnangagwa and members of his inner circle of enriching themselves while ordinary citizens suffer.The brain drain we are witnessing is not by choice, said Patson Muzuwa, one of the organisers.It is forced by the mismanagement and greed of a few elites who have destroyed the nations future.Attendees also reflected on the freedom of being able to gather and speak openly in the UK, contrasting it with the repression faced in Zimbabwe. Many expressed relief at having the space to criticise the regime without fear of police harassment.However, participants acknowledged the risks of their activism, warning that under the Patriotic Act of 2023, those who openly criticise the government abroad could face arrest and persecution if they return home.The meeting included contributions from Nobukhosi Dube, Melbar Dick, Luckmore Masanzu, Martha Mutima, Xoliso Sithole, Desire Kunaka and Blessing Tariro Makeyi. Opposition Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC) UK executive member Hatirarame Jenatry Muranganwa (Chihota) and Prince Justin Chihurani also participated.

We are talking of something that is unconstitutional, and the multitudes and the power of Zimbabweans will only lead to endorse what is constitutional. We are not going to be held hostage by a few individuals, said Fambi.\n\nIn its plot to extend Mnangagwas tenure, Zanu PF is hoping to take advantage of the opposition, which is in disarray.\n\nHowever, the bid has ignited factionalism within the ruling party, with one side emerging to resist the plan and back Mnangagwas deputy, Constantino Chiwenga, to succeed him.\n\nSeveral politicians including Tendai Biti have also vowed to fight Zanu PFs tenure extension.\n\nIn a political landscape that has a plethora of opposition parties, NPD deputy leader Kumbirayi Chenhare said they have the wherewithal to challenge Zanu PFs hegemony.\n\nWe are from the people, by the people, so our strength lies in the masses. Therefore, we will be well-funded and accepted, said Chenhare.\n\n",
