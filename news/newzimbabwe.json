            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nZimbabwes market regulator is seeking clarity from the central bank on new rules that would require companies to report their financial statements in the nations gold-backed currency, forcing them to adopt hyperinflationary accounting and increase the cost of doing business.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission, is engaged with the relevant authorities on the way forward, Justin Bgoni, the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange s chief executive officer, said Monday.\n\nGovernor John Mushayavanhu earlier this month ordered companies listed on the exchange to adopt the ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, for reporting purposes with immediate effect including for the 2024 audited financial statements. This requirement is consistent with the increase in the number and value of transactions settled in ZiG since its introduction on April 5, he said. The ZiG is used in 30% of all transactions in the economy with the remainder done in US dollars.\n\nSince 2023 companies listed on the exchange have been allowed to report their results in US dollars because of the currencys dominance in the economy and frequent collapse of the Zimbabwean dollar, which was replaced by the ZiG. Many companies, including blue-chip beverage manufacturer Delta Corp, have switched.\n\nZSE-listed FBC Holdings warned the move could have several negative consequences. It may introduce accounting complexities, inflation translation risks, investor concerns and regulatory challenges, the Harare-based lender said in a recent client note.\n\nIt will also require companies to adjust accounting software, financial models and auditing procedures and the application of IAS 29  financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies  guidelines, leading to frequent revaluations, it said.\n\nIt urged authorities to rethink their position. Given that the ZiG has demonstrated instabilities in the past, a hybrid approach where businesses can choose the most relevant currency would be more practical, FBCH said.\n\nThe ZiG is the nations sixth attempt at a functioning local currency since 2009. It has shed 95% of its value since its debut, amid exchange-rate volatility that forced authorities to devalue the currency in September.\n\nThe southern African nations difficult operating environment recently led to the exit of global accounting firms Deloitte LLP and PwC LLP.\n\n",

Mhlanga is the head of HSTv.\n\nMy client was invited to the police station thrice over the past four weeks with the police indicating that they wanted to have talks with him and on each occasion ,they released him indicating that they did not have any case against him.\n\nWhen we knew through the police about the polices intention my client walked in freely to the police and police read out the whole process of interviewing him and other relevant paperwork.\n\nBy lunchtime they were complete they should have taken the accused to court but alas, police decided to detain him till today, said Chris Mhike representing Mhlanga.\n\nThe cells at Harare Central Police Station are in a sorry state with ceilings hanging down.\n\nOur police does not provide inmates with food or water and inmates have normalised sleeping on a dry floor in this jurisdiction.\n\nThat is inhumane treatment. This conduct by the police has been sanitised by the NPA, every police report should be vetted properly.\n\nThe State said they need 72 hours to investigate the alleged complaints.\n\nThe court ordered it to investigate the complaints and revert with its findings within 72 hours.\n\nProsecutors said its witnesses are his junior colleagues.\n\nSome of them are yet to be recorded statements by the police\n\nInvestigations are still ongoing If the accused is granted bail, he will interferewith witnesses.\n\nThe prosecutor further said, There is a likelihood that he will commit similar offences, the same machinery which he used in the present case before the court are yet to be recovered by the police, procedures to recover same have commenced.\n\nMhike shot back saying The state has failed to make a valid legal point against the granting of bail.\n\nIf the prosecution had established that the accused person was previously on remand that would constitute compelling reasons.\n\nThe reasons are unfounded and groundless.\n\nMy sister (prosecutor) made a strange comparison that because he is a political reporter he therefore is a politician. We now see the politicisation of journalism.\n\nMhike also said, Silencing journalists is not part of law.\n\nMay the court be told that the so-called juniors have been visiting the accused in solidarity.\n\nIf the state thought they are dangerous they would have taken measures to reduce the visits.\n\nAccused is a journalist whose job is to gather news and disseminate the news.\n\nSection 61 of our Constitution speaks to freedom of expression and freedom of the media.\n\nWhat happened to press freedom in this country? I am pained that I am standing in court defending a journalists right to freedom of expression.\n\nThe last point is that the accused did not do this once but twice, yes he didnt do it twice but many times. It is his job.\n\nWhether you agree with what Geza said, the public is entitled to hear it. Its not my client who put these statements to the public.\n\nI pray that the court makes a finding that on the law the state has failed to find compelling reasons to detain my clients.\n\nThe hearing is ongoing, Josphat Chitambira arresting detail attached to CID Counter Terrorism Unit now testifying opposing bail\n\nFirstly, the witnesses we have lined up are the accuseds workmates, he is senior to them out of fear is that he will influence them and it is prejudicial.\n\nWe have 10 witnesses whom we intend to interview, he said.\n\n",

            "content": "SoftOrbits, a software development company founded in 2006 by Eugene Ustinenkov, focuses on building utilities that help photography enthusiasts deal with tedious and difficult technical tasks like format conversion or stamp removal. Starting as a small team of software experts, SoftOrbits has evolved into one of the leading niche companies with over 300,000 users and more than 1,000,000 yearly downloads.\n\nWhile the team initially prioritized small-scale software designed for amateurs with no technical photography background, its recent introduction of AI features to the Image Editor has gained a lot of traction with professionals. According toSoftOrbits internal data,experts account for over a quarterof the softwares total user base.\n\nEugene Ustinenkov, CEO of SoftOrbits and AlarmFront\n\nI think these numbers may seem a bit unexpected  they certainly were for us at first. However, theyre quite telling of the current state of the industry. Experts no longer view AI as a gimmick, and you can see it everywhere: from the Coca-Cola AI advertisements to AI usage in movie production by Marvel. Were no longer on the verge of living in a world with AI-generated content as the standard  were already here,says Eugene Ustinenkov, CEO of SoftOrbits and AlarmFront.\n\nAs Eugene Ustinenkov admits, initially AI Photo Editor was aimed at marketing teams and content creators, as well as general users, addressing their need for quick and simple solutions to common issues with images and photos: from quickly removing backgrounds and objects to fixing the lighting. From a few conversations with customers, it turned out that the speed the AI tool provides has become its major selling point even for professional photographers.\n\nWe can see how there is almost no way a pro can compete with these tools when it comes to speed, so a lot of photographers start integrating AI into their workflow. Most of the experts weve spoken to say that new customers expect different timeframes, so you either adapt or get left out. AI Photo Editor comes in handy here, because it isnt about generating images  photographers arent particularly enthusiastic about this  but because it helps deal with repetitive and time-consuming tasks,says Eugene Ustinenkov, CEO of SoftOrbits and Candidate of Technical Sciences.\n\nThe current version of SoftOrbits AI Photo Editor supports images with up to 8K resolution, provides multi-format export capabilities, and offers RAW file support. It is most commonly used to change the lighting, enhance portraits, remove objects, manipulate backgrounds, and apply special effects, but thats not the full extent of its capabilities.\n\nRecently, SoftOrbits introduced a prompt-based photo editing feature, which means that the tools possibilities are only limited by the users imagination. As Eugene explains, it is this functionality that became one of the selling points for the software even among professionals.\n\nThe industry inevitably gravitates toward greater AI adoption, and you can see so many startups offering AI-based photo editing, leaving less and less market space for traditional approaches. It doesnt mean that experts will get replaced  as long as they keep up with the technology and find ways to seamlessly integrate it to provide a better service, everyone wins, says Eugene Ustinenkov, CEO of SoftOrbits with 10+ years of software development experience.\n\nThe AI trend has affected SoftOrbits as well: This year, the team has integrated the technology into seven of their utilities, and right now, it helps SoftOrbits users with unblurring images, denoising photos, removing watermarks, and more. The team doesnt intend to stop here and already has plans to integrate AI into other solutions, focusing on increasing user-friendliness, speed, and simplicity of use.\n\nWith the recent increase in popularity of SoftOrbits tools among professionals, the team is focused on not only adding extra AI features but also increasing the softwares general availability by switching to a SaaS model of distribution.\n\nHannes Jansen\n\nSaaS was one of our goals for the past few years, but we were mostly focused on other aspects of our companys work. Now we see that this has become a priority  removing hardware requirements and ensuring instant global access is becoming an industry standard. We already provide SaaS solutions to our corporate partners, but the goal is to reach our everyday users as well  and we will achieve it soon enough,says Hannes Jansen, writer and editor at SoftOrbits.\n\nWhether youre a client interested in SoftOrbits products or a business owner willing to partner with the team, you can reach out atsupport@softorbits.comor visitsoftorbits.net.\n\n",

In the UK, cases are expected to rise from 58,756 cases a year in 2022 to 71,006 cases a year in 2050. Deaths will jump from 12,122 a year in 2022 to 17,261 in 2050.\n\nThe findings werepublished in the journal Nature Medicine.\n\nEvery minute, four women are diagnosed with breast cancer worldwide and one woman dies from the disease, and these statistics are worsening, said the IARC scientist Dr Joanne Kim, one of the authors of the report.\n\nCountries can mitigate or reverse these trends by adopting primary prevention policies  and by investing in early detection and treatment.\n\nThe projected increase in cases worldwide is probably due to a mix of factors, including a growing and ageing global population, improvements in detection and diagnosis, and a higher prevalence of known risk factors for the disease.\n\nFactors that increase the risk of breast cancer include getting older, inherited faulty genes and a family history of the disease.\n\nGlobally, most breast cancer cases and deaths occur in women aged 50 and above, who account for 71% of new cases and 79% of deaths, the IARC said.\n\nAbout a quarter of breast cancer cases can be prevented, the studys authors said, for example by reducing alcohol intake, maintaining a healthy weight and becoming more active.\n\nBreast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women worldwide but its burden is not evenly distributed. The IARC said diagnosis rates were highest in Australia and New Zealand, followed by North America and northern Europe, and lowest in Asia and Africa. However, death rates were highest in Melanesia and Polynesia, and in west Africa.\n\nOver the last decade, incidence rates grew by 1% to 5% a year in 27 of 50 countries studied, the IARC said. Importantly, breast cancer mortality rates decreased in 29 of 46 countries analysed.\n\nDr Isabelle Soerjomataram, the deputy head of the IARCs cancer surveillance branch, said: Continued progress in early diagnosis and improved access to treatment are essential to address the global gap in breast cancer and ensure that the goal of reducing suffering and death from breast cancer is achieved by all countries worldwide.\n\n",

He also severed ties with former mentor Kanye West when he ran for president, suspecting it was part of a wider Trump campaign tosiphon black peoples votes away from the Democrats.\n\nThe debate over Rwandas relationship with popular global figures is also not new.\n\nMost recently, Rwanda has been accused of sportswashing  with critics saying it uses the feel-good factor of international football to cover up alleged human rights abuses at home.\n\nThe East African nation is said to receive $1bn (800m) a year in foreign aid and its tourism arm  Visit Rwanda  has lucrative sponsorship deals with Arsenal in England, Bayern Munich in Germany and Paris St-Germain in France.\n\nWhen asked his thoughts on the topic, Legends aide told the BBC that he would not answer that question.\n\nIt appears that, as far as Legend and his team are concerned, his music itself should do the talking.\n\n",

He will be jointly charged with Cuthbert Maoko, a clearing agent licensed by ZIMRA who is already on remand.\n\nWang is being charged for contravening the Parks and Wildlife Act.\n\nHe was remanded in custody when he appeared before Harare magistrate Isheanesu Matova who advised him to seek bail at the High Court.\n\nAccording to prosecutor Rufaro Chonzi, on 12 September 2024 Wang went to the airport holding a 13-kilogram owl-hardened plastic sculpture to which he intended to facilitate its shipment to China by processing its export papers.\n\nIt is alleged that security officials observed the accused holding the parcel which looked suspicious and alerted other stakeholders.\n\nThe sculpture was put on AGS Scanner and the image was not consistent which prompted the stakeholders to want to verify what was contained therein.\n\nThe sculpture was placed on items held by Zimra on receipt number 029910A on 12 September 2024 awaiting a two months period. After the lapse of the two-month period and on the 20 November 2024, the concerned stakeholders who first witnessed the item being taken into custody by ZIMRA were again summoned to witness the breaking of the sculptor the clearing agent.\n\nWhen the sculpture was broken, it was discovered that there were five rhino horn pieces which were wrapped by a newspaper and tied by a transparent plastic hidden inside.\n\nThe agent implicated the accused as the one who gave him the sculpture which contained the recovered rhino horn pieces.\n\nThe agent called Wang to come to the airport to answer the questions relating to the case but the accused disappeared.\n\nThe five Rhino horn pieces were seized by Zimra on notice of seizure receipt number 024315L.\n\nThe recovered exhibit was conveyed to Zimparks for assaying where it was assayed in the presence of the agent since the accused was on the run and it was found to be five pieces of rhino horns all valued at US$360,000.\n\n*The third paragraph has been edited to clarify that Cuthbert Maoko is not a ZIMRA agent but a clearing agent licensed by the revenue authority.\n\n",

Growth in export volumes was buttressed by the firming of export prices to an average 75 US cents per kg from 44 US per kg cents achieved in the prior year following global easing of Covid-19 imposed restrictions.\n\nThe company sold 60% of its non-exportable secondary grade for oil extraction and to the retail and informal sector, while 40% was unsalable.\n\nIn the ensuing financial year, it is expected that the previously unsalable secondary grades will be channelled towards crude oil extraction.\n\nMacadamia production of 1 626 tons increased by 77% over prior year production of 921 tons. Exports declined by 3% to 1 508 tons from 1551 tons in the previous year, due to logistical issues caused by rescheduled ships, affecting the last consignment of 286 tons.\n\nThe decline in packed tea sales volumes of 7% from 1 873 tons in the prior year to 1 733 tons in this financial year was due to packaging material supply constraints, depressed performance from the traditional formal customers and overall macroeconomic dynamics.\n\nThe operating environment is expected to remain complex, largely influenced by adverse developments on currency and inflation. The effects of the El Nino-induced drought are likely to persist until the next harvesting period in April 2025, added Nkala.\n\n",
