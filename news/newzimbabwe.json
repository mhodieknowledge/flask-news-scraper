The club failed to settle the amount within the 45-day deadline.\n\nChitiyo signed a three-year contract with Nyasa Big Bullets on 2 April 2024, but he played only one season before his contract was unlawfully terminated. During his time at the club, he was coached by Zimbabwean Kalisto Pasuwa, who has since left Nyasa Big Bullets and now leads the Malawi mens national team.\n\nChitiyo currently plays for Green Fuel FC, a club he joined upon returning from Malawi earlier this year.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nVice President Constantino Chiwenga has once again pledged zero tolerance for tender manipulation and corrupt practices, which continue to plague Zimbabwe and undermine service delivery.\n\nHis latest remarks, delivered Thursday at the Construction Industry Federation of Zimbabwe annual congress in Masvingo, come just days after he reportedly presented an explosive corruption dossier at a Zanu PF Politburo meeting in Harare.\n\nThe dossier is said to have stoked tensions within the ruling party, allegedly prompting President Emmerson Mnangagwa to cut short his trip to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. This at a time when Zimbabwe is lobbying for a seat on the UN Security Council.\n\nWe cannot and will not tolerate corruption, tender manipulation, or unethical dealings that undermine confidence and compromise delivery, Chiwenga declared.\n\nHe painted a grim picture of the damage corruption has done to Zimbabwes global reputation, stressing that economic growth rests on honesty and sacrifice.\n\nAll thriving economies the world over were built through sacrifice, honesty, and hard work, he said. Unethical dealings result in public outrage and diminished consumer confidence, which can significantly damage the reputation of companies and individuals, ultimately affecting future business opportunities and national development.\n\nChiwenga has previously derided corrupt business figures as zvigananda,a Shona term describing those who amass ill-got wealth. While he has not publicly named tycoons such as Wicknell Chivayo, Kudakwashe Tagwirei, or Paul Tungwarara, reports suggest their names feature in the dossier he presented to the Politburo.\n\nControversial businessman Wicknell Chivayo has been implicated in a US$40 million tender awarded by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) to supply electoral materials for the 2023 general elections, where prices were allegedly inflated by 235%. He was also linked to a scandal over a government contract worth approximately US$437 million for the supply of cancer treatment equipment, awarded without a transparent tendering process.\n\nMnangagwas adviser to the UAE, Paul Tungwarara, through his company Prevail Group International, was contracted under the Presidential Borehole Scheme to drill thousands of solar-powered boreholes across the country, a tender critics say was awarded opaquely.\n\nSimilarly, Sakunda Holdings, a company linked to Kudakwashe Tagwirei, secured contracts worth over US$1 billion to supply inputs under Zimbabwes Command Agriculture scheme without an open tender, with more than US$280 million in funds reported as unaccounted for.\n\nThe VPsanti-graft salvo comes amid an intensifying succession battle between factions loyal to Mnangagwa and Chiwenga, with some analysts warning the rift could escalate to a coup.\n\nMnangagwa recently reshuffled the Politburo, demoting Chiwenga ally Obert Mpofu from the influential post of Secretary General to a less significant ICT portfolioan apparent move to weaken Chiwengas hand in the power struggle.\n\n",

            "content": "Xinhua\n\nIn recent years, Zimbabwes blueberry industry has grown rapidly, bringing local farmers higher incomes. This year, producers are setting their sights on exporting blueberries to China, one of the worlds largest and most lucrative markets.\n\nHARARE, Sept. 25 (Xinhua)  Inside a greenhouse located in ZimbabwesMashonaland West Province, workers carefully hand-pick fresh blueberries from lush green shrubs, ensuring only the best fruit makes it to the baskets.\n\nIn recent years, Zimbabwes blueberry industry has grown rapidly, bringing local farmers higher incomes. This year, producers are setting their sights on exporting blueberries to China, one of the worlds largest and most lucrative markets.\n\nEarlier this month, Zimbabwe signed a trade agreement allowing fresh blueberry exports to China, a move farmers say will spur production to meet the surge in demand.\n\nIt is a huge market. They are the biggest exporters of blueberries, among the biggest growers of blueberries, and also one of the biggest importers of blueberries. So, it really has taken off there, said Alistair Campbell, a blueberry farmer from the province.\n\nSupported by favorable climate conditions, increased agricultural investment, and rising demand for this healthy food, Zimbabwes blueberry industry is expanding. According to the countrys Horticultural Development Council (HDC), production is expected to rise from 8,000 metric tons in 2024 to 12,000 metric tons in 2025.\n\nFarmers believe that Zimbabwes strategic geographic location  allowing early access to global markets  gives the country a competitive edge. Our product is well received. We get big, nice-tasting berries. And its well-received in the market thus far. We just need more scale, more blueberries, Campbell said, adding that the opportunity to export to China positions Zimbabwe as a significant player in blueberry production.\n\nWe really need to get things moving pretty quickly. We hope to have some really good engagements with government to see what we can get done there, and also with funders to make sure that we get enough plants in the ground to satisfy at least a part of that Chinese market, he added.\n\nIn a statement following the signing of the blueberry export agreement, the HDC called for policies to increase investment, expand production to required volumes, and ensure that Zimbabwes blueberries consistently meet Chinas quality and phytosanitary standards.\n\nJoseph Kakoto, president of the Zimbabwe Young Farmers Association for Sustainable Development, a youth-led organization, expressed optimism about the growth prospects of the Chinese export market, saying the protocol would attract new investment in plantations, packhouses, and cold chain infrastructure, creating jobs along the value chain.\n\nThis protocol is a win-win. Zimbabwe gains access to a lucrative market, while China secures reliable food imports, Kakoto told Xinhua.\n\nThe deal, he said, signals Zimbabwes entry into high-value horticultural exports such as blueberries, opening the door to greater foreign currency earnings and investment.\n\nI am very confident about the Chinese market because it is huge and steadily growing with a rising middle class that demands healthy premium foods such as blueberries. Zimbabwes climate and soil are highly suitable for premium berries, giving us a competitive edge, he said.\n\n",
