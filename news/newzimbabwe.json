            "content": "Jonisayi Maromo l IOL\n\nZIMBABWE has stepped in to help neighbouring Botswana with a consignment of anti-retroviral drugs (ARVs), sending a batch that combines both a donation and a loan as Gaborone grapples with temporary shortages in its HIV treatment programme.\n\nAccording to a statement from the Botswana Embassy in Harare, trucks carrying the life-saving medicines departed Zimbabwe earlier this week under a bilateral arrangement that includes 20% of the consignment as a donation and 80% as a loan to be reimbursed in ARVs.The government of the Republic of Zimbabwe extended a generous gesture to the Republic of Botswana through a loan facility, with 20% of the consignment as a donation and 80% provided as a loan to be reimbursed in the form of ARVs, the Embassy of Botswana in Zimbabwe said.Botswanas Ambassador to Zimbabwe, Sarah Molosiwa, conveyed her governments appreciation on behalf of President Duma Gideon Boko, describing the shipment as a vital gesture of solidarity between two friendly nations.Ambassador Molosiwa was received and briefed by NatPharm Managing Director Newman Mazikwa before the convoys departure.The Botswana Ministry of Health and Wellness confirmed on Thursday that the ARVs had arrived in Gaborone.In a statement posted to its verified Facebook page, the ministry said the consignment would help stabilise the countrys ARV supply chain after procurement delays had caused concern among patients and health facilities.Loaning medicines and medical commodities is a common practice for countries that are friendly to each other as Botswana is to its neighbours, the ministry said.This will help stabilise the ARV situation in the country.Zimbabwes growing pharmaceutical powerThe emergency shipment underscores Zimbabwes growing pharmaceutical and logistics capacity, which has seen a sharp turnaround under President Emmerson Mnangagwas drive to boost local manufacturing and health-sector self-sufficiency.According to The Herald newspaper in Zimbabwe, Mnangagwa recently commissioned a US$6.96 million (more than R12 billion) National Pharmaceutical Company (NatPharm) warehouse in Mutare, describing it as a major step towards transforming Zimbabwe into a regional hub for medical supplies.Since 2018, there has been a 56 percent increase in the number of pharmaceutical entities from nine in 2020 to the current 14, Mnangagwa was quoted as saying at the launch.He added that the mega pharmaceutical warehouse represents a significant milestone in our concerted efforts to enhance access to essential medicines and health commodities, especially in rural areas.A viable health sector is not only an indicator, but also a precondition and outcome of social and economic sustainable development, he added.Analysts say the ability to loan ARVs to a neighbouring country marks a symbolic shift for Zimbabwe  once plagued by chronic drug shortages and donor dependence, it is now positioning itself as a regional player in pharmaceutical resilience and humanitarian diplomacy.Regional solidarity in actionThe exchange has sparked widespread attention across social media, where many Zimbabweans have hailed the gesture as a sign of progress and regional cooperation.In Botswana, health commentators have welcomed the move as evidence of African solutions to African challenges, with some urging that the arrangement be formalised into a Southern African Development Community (SADC) health-security framework.Observers say the episode could mark a turning point in Southern Africas approach to medicine security, where countries increasingly rely on each other to manage stock-outs caused by procurement delays, global supply disruptions or funding constraints.For Botswana, the immediate effect is stabilisation of ARV supplies for thousands of patients.

South African traveller Andile (@godly2.0), who shared a captivating video of his leopard sighting on TikTok while visiting Mana Pools in the Zambezi River Valley, Zimbabwe.During his stay at Machaba Safari Camps, Andiles keen eyes and camera captured a moment he will never forget.In his video, he zooms in on a leopard resting under the wooden deck of a safari-tented camp, nibbling on its catch  an antelope.This is a sight that many safari-goers might easily miss.Experts explain that spotting leopards on safari can be quite challenging.These solitary, nocturnal hunters rely on exceptional camouflage, stealth, and a secretive nature.Their distinctive spotted coats enable them to blend seamlessly into their surroundings, such as dry grass and foliage.During the day, leopards often rest in trees or dense vegetation, making them virtually invisible unless they move.As a fortunate traveller, Andiles safari adventures in the region yielded sightings that many wildlife enthusiasts would envy.While enjoying dinner at the camp under the stars, a curious hyena came to check out the scene.He also encountered a crocodile entering the water while he was canoeing with a guide on a river safari.Mana Pools is renowned for its exceptional wildlife viewing, unique walking and canoeing safaris, and stunning, remote scenery.As a UNESCO World Heritage Site, it boasts a high concentration of wildlife, including elephants, lions, leopards, and wild dogs, along with a diverse array of bird species.Experiencing safaris on foot or by canoe provides a more immersive and intimate connection

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA NAMIBIAN delegation is in Zimbabwe on a benchmarking mission aimed at strengthening cooperation in Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) with a particular focus on diamond cutting and polishing at Zimbabwes only Diamond Training Centre.\n\nThe delegation, led by Namibia Training Authority (NTA) Chief Operations Officer Penda Shilongo and Zimbabwean government officials visited polytechnics across the country, Chinhoyi University of Technology, Diamond Training Centre and the Zimbabwe School of Mines among other training institutions.The purpose of the visit is to learn from Zimbabwes experience in developing skills for mineral beneficiation and industrial value addition.Speaking during the visit to the Diamond Training Centre, an indigenous-owned institute based in Harare, Shilongo said Namibia wanted to draw lessons from Zimbabwes model of transforming natural resource wealth into employment through practical skills development.What we take home is that we need to start with mineral beneficiation in our country. At the moment, we do not have a training facility that offers these types of skills. We see this as an opportunity to collaborate and leverage the expertise of our sister country so that we can also add value to our mineral resources in Namibia, Shilongo said.He added that Namibia was eager to strengthen bilateral cooperation with Zimbabwe, particularly in upskilling trainers and aligning TVET standards across the SADC region.We invite our Zimbabwean counterparts to visit Namibia to identify areas where we can also assist each other. There is a lot to learn from one another, he said.The NTA, which regulates the countrys TVET system, is implementing reforms to bridge gaps in technical training and align courses with emerging industries such as green energy.Richard Kambinda, acting general manager for TVET and VTC development support, said Zimbabwes capacity in vocational training was impressive and that the visit would help Namibia build stronger foundations for technical education.We came to Zimbabwe on a study tour to see what programmes can help us bridge the gaps we have in Namibia, Kambinda said.We dont have a diamond-cutting college back home, so its important to learn from our brothers and sisters here. Weve seen that Zimbabwe has the capacity and we believe Zimbabwe can help us.The visit is part of a broader agenda to finalise a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the two countries, focusing on dual certification, curriculum development, trainers capacity building, quality assurance, Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) integration, and SADC TVET harmonisation.Diamond Training Centre founder and director Lovemore Kurotwi said the visit was a significant recognition of Zimbabwes growing influence in technical skills transfer and beneficiation training.We are a private, indigenous-owned institution, and I am grateful to our government and the Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education for licensing and recognising our pivotal role in this economy, Kurotwi said.We are transferring vital skills to our young people, which is key to building an industrialised nation.He said the institutes mission is to transform Zimbabwe from an exporter of raw minerals to a manufacturer of finished products.We complain about unemployment, yet we have all the resources. The missing link is skills. Without skills, there is no industry to talk about, he said. That is why our thrust is on training and skills transfer. When another government comes to benchmark us, it shows we are on the right path.The diamond training institute plays a strategic role in Zimbabwes mineral beneficiation agenda by equipping students with expertise in diamond cutting, polishing, grading, and valuation skills once exclusive to foreign operators.Kurotwi said the Namibian delegations tour shows growing continental cooperation in vocational education, as African nations increasingly seek to localise value addition and empower their youth through hands-on technical skills.Meanwhile, despite having a beneficiation policy, Zimbabwe still exports raw minerals.The country continues to train personnel, most of whom end up leaving because there is no beneficiation industry.\n\nThe delegation, led by Namibia Training Authority (NTA) Chief Operations Officer Penda Shilongo and Zimbabwean government officials visited polytechnics across the country, Chinhoyi University of Technology, Diamond Training Centre and the Zimbabwe School of Mines among other training institutions.\n\nThe purpose of the visit is to learn from Zimbabwes experience in developing skills for mineral beneficiation and industrial value addition.Speaking during the visit to the Diamond Training Centre, an indigenous-owned institute based in Harare, Shilongo said Namibia wanted to draw lessons from Zimbabwes model of transforming natural resource wealth into employment through practical skills development.What we take home is that we need to start with mineral beneficiation in our country.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nWOES continue to mount for jailed businessmen Mike Chimombe and Moses Mpofu, with the State now seeking to confiscate their properties following their conviction in a US$7 million fraud case.\n\nThe duo, who face a possible minimum 20-year jail term if convicted, will now be sentenced on November 17 after the State indicated its intention to apply for a confiscation order under Section 50(1) of the Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Act [Chapter 9:24].The law empowers authorities to trace, seize, and confiscate assets suspected to have been acquired through criminal activity.Prosecutors believe some of Mpofu and Chimombes properties were bought using proceeds of the goat tender fraud.We had given notice in terms of section 50(1) of the Money Laundering Act, said prosecutor Whispher Mabhaudhi while seeking a postponement of the case on Friday.Mabhaudhi said the States application is ready but has been delayed pending the uploading of the courts written judgment.Once the judgment is uploaded, then the State will file its application, he added.Justice Pisirayi Kwenda, who convicted the pair, said their separate judgments would be available by next Wednesday.The two are expected back in court on November 14 for pre-sentencing proceedings.Sentencing is expected on November 17.Mpofu and Chimombe were found guilty last week after spending over a year in remand prison.The State proved that the fraud emanated from false documents submitted through their company, Blackdeck Private Limited, in September 2021, when the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture invited bids for the supply of 632,001 goats worth US$87 million under a national livestock pass-on scheme.After winning the tender, the contract was instead signed by Blackdeck Livestock and Poultry Farming, an unregistered entity, with Mpofu representing the company and Chimombe acting as a witness.Investigations revealed that Blackdeck Private Limited had no valid tax clearance certificate from the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA), and that the QR code on its National Social Security Authority (NSSA) compliance certificate belonged to another firm, Skywalk Investments.Relying on these misrepresentations, the ministry paid ZWL$1.6 billionthen equivalent to US$7.7 millionin two instalments on April 21 and June 29, 2022.When the company failed to deliver, it falsely claimed to have mobilised 32,500 goats across provinces, but verification showed only 3,713 goats were available.After the Ministry of Lands realised that they were being deceived by the accused persons, they then cancelled the contract on August 29, 2022, said the National Prosecuting Authority of Zimbabwe (NPAZ).To date, only 4,208 goats worth US$331,445.25 have been delivered, leaving the government prejudiced of US$7,380,751.85.\n\nThe duo, who face a possible minimum 20-year jail term if convicted, will now be sentenced on November 17 after the State indicated its

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nNATIONAL Tyre Services (NTS) has tabled plans to delist from the Zimbabwe Stock Exchange (ZSE) due to insignificant returns prompted by a tough economic environment and the influx of cheaper imports.\n\nIn a Circular to shareholders published this week, NTS said after a comprehensive review of the companys listing requirements, it was agreed that the benefits of maintaining the listing status no longer pay off as was the case in the previous years.\n\nThe company, which has been on the ZSE listing since 1969, is now seeking shareholder approval to green-light the move.\n\nThe operating environment has, however, been characterised by persistent macroeconomic instability over the past decades. The business has been adversely affected by severe exchange rate volatility, liquidity constraints and shortages of foreign currency, all of which have materially hindered the importation of tyres and raw materials, the company said.\n\nThe Zimbabwean tyre industry has, in recent years, experienced heightened competition due to low entry barriers and the influx of imported brands, resulting in a loss of market share for the company said limited access to long-term and affordable capital has also constrained the companys ability to execute its expansion strategy and maintain adequate working capital levels.\n\nDespite numerous efforts to secure funding through the local banking system, borrowing has remained prohibitively expensive. Operationally, NTS continues to face significant challenges, such as power supply deficits have disrupted production at the retreading factory, where capacity utilisation has averaged approximately 30%.\n\nIn conjunction with the proposed delisting, major shareholder Radun Investments (Private) Limited is extending a mandatory offer to acquire all shares held by minority shareholders. The offer is for a cash consideration of US$0.0248 per share. This provides a clear and structured opportunity for minority shareholders to exit their investment at a price deemed fair and reasonable by Independent Financial Advisors, said NTS.\n\nThe total indicative share trading liquidity for National Tyre Services Limited (NTS.zw) in the past 12 months, as of 1st October 2025, is US$1.06million (ZWG28.41million). An average of US$88,170 (ZWG2.37 million) per month.\n\n",
