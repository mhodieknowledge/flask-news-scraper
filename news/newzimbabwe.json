            "content": "In the past six months, a ZAM team in seven African countries has investigated the Russian recruitment exerciseand why so many young Africans take the chance to go, sometimes even after being warned.\n\nLate last year, the world was alerted to the disturbing news that Russia wasrecruitinghundreds of young African women, aged 1822, to manufacture drones in a military-industrial compound called Alabuga, 1,000 km east of Moscow.\n\nReports said that the recruitsfrom at least 15 African countrieswere promised good salaries and skills training, but that once there, they were often trapped, facing tax deductions, dangerous working conditions, strict surveillance, and difficulties returning home.\n\nIn the past six months, a ZAM team in seven African countries has investigated the Russian recruitment exerciseand why so many young Africans take the chance to go, sometimes even after being warned.\n\nHowever, amid the many international reports about recruitment for Alabuga, only one has highlighted the plight of families left behind. Reporting for Deutsche Welle, Garikai Mafirakurevainterviewedworried parents in Zimbabwe in June this year.\n\nAt ZAMs request, he went back to several of them to ask how they are doing now. A senior government official asked me if I wanted my daughter to study in Russia. She is no longer communicating.\n\nRead the three testimonials below.\n\nUlita Semende: We hardly speak these days\n\nI am 47, I live in Harare, and my daughter is 19. She was active in various youth programmes (1), and when she told me she was leaving for Russia, I was not surprised, and I wished her well. My daughter and I are very close, so when she stopped calling, I became very worried about her.\n\nWe hardly speak these days. Whenever she calls via WhatsAppthe last time was in Mayshe sounds like she is in a hurry. I am beginning to believe the stories I hear about the girls manufacturing drones because she is so secretive about her job or her schooling programme.\n\nI received $400 via Western Union in May this year. I dont know where to turn to. I am afraid to approach government officials, because I feel they would say that I am the one who is feeding the media with news.\n\nZimbabwes ruling party, ZANU-PF, organises several workshops and training programmes for loyal youth.\n\nSositina Mukatwa: The government is mum\n\nI am 43 and I live in Chivhu (140 km south of Harare). My girl is 19. When she applied and went to Russia, she never told me about the programme.\n\nThe only thing I remember is that she was running around asking for money from friends and neighbours to process her passport. Thats when I inquired, and she then told me that she wanted to surprise me because she was leaving for Russia.\n\nAt first, I was so happy because I thought this was her opportunity to help me and her two siblings with school fees and the general upkeep.\n\nNow, I am afraid, not knowing if she is fine, because she rarely communicates. She has only called thrice to say she is fine, but I could sense she was not free to talk, as if someone were listening or she had little time on the phone. In fact, we have only talked three times via WhatsApp since she left in 2023.\n\nThe last time we talked, she sounded drunk and hinted to me that she had been laid off and was living with a friend, but when she called me in June, she said she is back at work and sent me $200 via Western Union.\n\nShe doesnt want to talk about her job, her living conditions, or even the school programme. She never said when she is coming back to visit. I am living in fear because the government is mum about the whole programme. I dont know what to do now.\n\nRuzvidzo Masambaasiyana: I feel like I sold my daughter into slavery\n\nI am 55, I live in Harare, and my girl is turning 20 in January next year. I heard of this programme from a friend, a senior government employee, who asked me if I wanted my daughter to study in Russia. So I facilitated the process.\n\nWhen she left for Russia, I felt my connection to those in higher offices had now paid. I was not worried until I read and watched the news saying they are manufacturing drones used in the war against Ukraine.\n\nI tried to talk to her about it when she last called me sometime in April, but she brushed me aside and told me I should not always believe what I watch on TV or read in the newspapers.\n\nI am now worried because she is no longer communicating. She never sent me anything, but I am not worried about her sending me money or not, as long as she is safe.\n\nI approached my friend, the government employee, about the issue, and he joked that I should stop expecting a bridegroom from Russia. He never spoke to me again about the programme, and she is also not talking about it. I no longer trust him. I want my daughter back, but I cant do anything about it. I feel like I sold my daughter into slavery.\n\nAll names have been altered for security purposes.\n\nZAM extends its thanks to Deutsche Welle and Garikai Mafirakureva for their collaboration.\n\nThis article was first published by ZAM Magazinehere.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nZimbabwes plans to stage their 2026 Fifa World Cup qualifier against South Africa in Francistown have been scuppered by the Botswana Football Association (BFA), which confirmed that the Francistown Sports Complex is unavailable.\n\nThe venue will host Botswanas own qualifier against Uganda on 9 October, just a day before the scheduled meeting between the Warriors and Bafana Bafana. That clash of dates contravenes FIFA regulations, which require that visiting teams be given access to match venues the day before a fixture.\n\nThe impasse now points to Zimbabwe relocating their home game to South Africa, with two familiar options in the frame: Orlando Stadium in Johannesburg and Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban. Both arenas have served as temporary home grounds in previous years when Zimbabwean facilities failed to meet international standards.\n\nReports at the weekend suggested Moses Mabhida was the favoured choice, though no confirmation has come from the South African Football Association, as the final decision rests with the Zimbabwe Football Association (Zifa).\n\nIn the meantime, Zifa has bristled at the BFAs handling of the matter, condemning its public announcement as premature. Spokesperson Mike Madoda said: It is Zifas prerogative to pick a venue that suits our interests. Zimbabwe will always make decisions that are in the interests of the Warriors and Zimbabwean football.\n\nMadoda also rejected speculation that Zifa had been swayed by financial inducements to stage the match in South Africa, dismissing such claims as baseless. He underlined that venue selection remains an internal process, carried out with independence and integrity.\n\nThe dispute underscores the undercurrents of regional rivalry in Southern African football, where off-field logistics often intertwine with long-standing national competition.\n\nFor Zimbabwe, the bigger picture is already clear: their World Cup campaign is over after a torrid run produced only four points from eight matches, leaving them bottom of Group C without a win. The Warriors struggles mark a sobering end to their qualification hopes.\n\nBy contrast, Bafana Bafana are riding high. Coach Hugo Broos has moulded a side that sits atop the group with 17 points, galvanised by cohesion, tactical discipline and growing belief. South Africa are now on the brink of confirming their place at the 2026 finals in the United States, Canada and Mexico.\n\nStill, the fixture between neighbours carries significance beyond mathematics. Zimbabwes captain Knowledge Musona has promised his side will fight for pride: We may not have lived up to our hopes in the tournament, but we want to ensure we leave everything on the pitch against South Africa.\n\nThe clash, whenever and wherever it is finally staged, will serve as both a test of Bafana Bafanas momentum and a chance for Zimbabwe to reassert their footballing pride, ensuring the rivalry burns as fiercely as ever.\n\n",

This had resulted in further growth and margin expansion, on top of the improvement across key metrics achieved in the 2025 financial year.\n\nTheir strategy, being implemented in a weak macro-economic environment in South Africa, focuses on increasing long-term leadership and competitiveness, through enhanced profitability and cash flow.\n\nIn the four-months, group earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) increased by more than 20% over the comparable period a year before, and the EBITDA margin grew by over 2 percentage points, PPCs directors stated.\n\nSales volumes in South Africa and Botswana increased by 2% due to stronger retail sales and sales of clinker to PPC Zimbabwe.\n\nThe four-month EBITDA for South Africa and Botswana cement continued to see notable improvement, with the EBITDA margin significantly increasing from 10.3% to 17.7%.\n\nThe timing of certain plant shutdowns contributed positively. As this normalises in the six months ending September 30, 2025, the South Africa and Botswana cement margin is expected to remain at around 17%, PPCs directors said.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, cement sales volumes increased by 22%, largely due to strong consumer demand and the positive impact of a 30% tariff on imported cement introduced in May 2025.\n\nIn the first two months of the current period, PPC Zimbabwe implemented an extended shutdown at its Colleen Bawn plant. This was planned as part of a three-year plant performance improvement plan to better position PPC Zimbabwe to produce higher own-clinker volumes for the production of cement, thereby supplying the growing demand in the market.\n\n",

In recent years, US immigration authorities have confirmed that hundreds of Zimbabweans were on the removal docket  targeted for deportation due to immigration violations or criminal records.In 2023, Zimbabwes government confirmed it had received deportees from the US and the UK, and President Emmerson Mnangagwas administration publicly stated that it respects other countries immigration laws.Reports at the time suggested that more than 500 Zimbabweans were earmarked for removal from the US, although only smaller groups have been returned in phases.The latest arrivals highlight the ongoing challenges of deportations, including reintegration into Zimbabwean society and support for returnees who, like Mabhugu, have spent most of their lives abroad.\n\nOne of the deportees, only identified as Mabugu, said he has no recollection of his relatives in Zimbabwe, or the local language.\n\nPrevious deportationsThis is not the first time Zimbabweans have been deported from the United States.

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nDESPITE several cases having been reported on human-wildlife conflict resulting in death and injury countrywide over the years, it is sad to note that Zimbabwe still lacks policy on compensation for those affected.\n\nEnvironment Minister Evelyn Ndlovu last week told the Senate, through a ministerial statement, that until the Parks and Wildlife Amendment Bill went through Parliament, government was incapacitated to to come up with any programme regarding compensation for victims.\n\nEvery month, cases of wild animals attacking people are being reported and some have lost lives whilst others got permanent injuries but there have been no policy or law to effect compensation.\n\nIt is important to note that Zimbabwe currently lacks a formal nationwide policy on compensation, until the Bill goes through Parliament and through the Senate, we are incapacitated to come up with a programme.\n\nThis compensation fund, is relief for the loss of human life due to human-wildlife conflict, will only be developed once the Act is passed through Senate and is gazetted, Ndlovu said.\n\nShe said CAMPFIRE districts instead, were using local mechanisms to assist victims with funeral and medical expenses and some districts extend support to victims children by paying school fees.\n\nThe government, through a November 2022 Cabinet Resolution and the August 2023 SONA announcement by President Emmerson Mnangagwa was committed to establishing the Human-Wildlife Conflict Relief Fund.\n\nThe Parks and Wildlife Bill, which is in the final stages in the House, is intended to provide the legal framework for this fund.\n\nThrough specific funding, although specific funding mechanisms are yet to be determined, once enacted, the Bill will enable relief for victims in cases of death, injury, maiming and hospitalisation resulting from wildlife conflict, said the minister.\n\nHowever, Ndlovu stated relief was not expected to extend to livestock predation and crop damage at this initial phase.\n\nShe highlighted: This legislative change is a significant step in addressing relief for the affected communities, as we seek to incorporate relief for crop damage and livestock predation in the near future.\n\nRecommendation number five, the Minister of Tourism and Hospitality Industry, through ZimParks authorities, should consider to raise the elephant quota per year from the current three to a minimum of 10 elephants per year for the communities co-existing with wildlife.\n\nThe minister submitted that the recommendation was from the Environment Parliamentary Committee and ZimParks took note of the recommendation to increase the elephant management quota for communities co-existing with the wildlife.\n\nNdlovu undertook to act on the recommendation.\n\n",
