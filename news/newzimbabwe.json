            "content": "IOL\n\nSouth Africas Minister for Minerals and Petroleum Resources Gwede Mantashe said his country is initiating discussions with Zambia and Zimbabwe on the possibility of running the electricity transmission line from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) under the Grand Inga project, through which 2,500 megawatts are envisaged for the country.\n\nMantashe was responding to questions from members of the Portfolio Committee on Minerals and Petroleum Resources on Tuesday, who had asked about the status of the project and what the country was doing to harness regional collaboration following the decision to postpone participation in the project.\n\nThe Grand Inga project is not ours; its a DRC project, given to the Spanish and Chinese. We have a right to buy equity in it, which would have to be approved by the DRC. We have not bought that equity, so we cant really pretend to be managing the Inga project. It is not our project. We have committed ourselves to a quantity of electricity that will be taken up by South Africa, but the driving of the project is out of our jurisdiction, Mantashe said.\n\nMKP MP Crown Prince Adil Nchabaleng objected to the Ministers stance, indicating that South Africa still considered the project feasible.\n\nYou cant expect to tell us that you are going to power South Africa from the Grand Inga project. Is South Africa talking about a concession to resell in that market with regard to the 2 500 MW as an investment partnership? You cannot power South Africa from the Grand Inga project, he said.\n\nMantashe maintained that there were ongoing discussions.\n\nThe Grand Inga Hydropower Project, a massive dam construction on the Congo River in the DRC, is intended to generate a large amount of electricity, with South Africa being a key off-taker. This project is envisioned as a major source of clean energy for the region and potentially for the entire African continent.\n\nSouth Africa has expressed interest in importing electricity from the Grand Inga project, particularly from Inga 3, the first of the new hydropower facilities.\n\nSouth Africas energy planning assumes the country will import 2500 MW from Inga by 2030, with the potential to double this to 5 000 MW.\n\nA long transmission line, passing through Angola, Namibia, and Botswana, would be needed to deliver power from Inga to Gauteng, South Africas economic heartland.\n\nSouth Africa and the DRC have signed agreements on receiving electricity from Inga, and the project is in the process of finalizing an agreement and securing financing.\n\nMeanwhile, Mantashe clarified that the launch of the South African National Petroleum Corporation (SANPC), which resulted from the restructuring of the department into two entities, may seem like a negative intervention to many, but gave the department space and opportunity to prioritise petroleum appropriately. He noted that petroleum is a source of 80% of the worlds energy but currently plays second fiddle to renewables.\n\n",

            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nZimbabwe expects the $2.6 billion bridge finance  needed to repay debt owed to international financial institutions and regain access to capital markets  to be in place by the first quarter of next year, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube said.\n\nNcube shared details of the roadmap to revamp the southern African nations debt at an event in Abidjan, Ivory Coasts commercial capital, on Monday, on the sidelines of the African Development Banks annual meetings.\n\nThe country is currently negotiating with some of the worlds richest nations, including the UK, Germany and Brazil to become bridge financiers. The nation wrote to 10 nations to request bridge funds, Ncube said, adding that official bilateral bridge loans are governments preferred strategy to clear the arrears.\n\nThe southern African nation owes creditors $21 billion. The debt has precluded it from accessing global capital markets since it defaulted on payments in 1999.\n\nIt expects to finalise a staff-monitored program with the International Monetary Fund by the end of June, a key step to attract bridge financing sponsors. An IMF delegation is also scheduled to pay a visit to the country next month.\n\nThe European Investment Fund, which the country owes $390 million, made up of $150 million principal and the rest in interest, expects to be treated as preferred creditor, in the debt talks, said Roger Stuart, head of regional hub at EIB.\n\nThat is the totality of the arrears will be paid to EIB without any losses, he said. We will be part of a process whereby all the international financial institutions will agree.\n\nOutgoing AfDB President Akinwumi Adesina urged the Abidjan-based lender to consider using part of its African Development Fund to help Zimbabwe clear some of its arrears.\n\nI am ending my time as AfDB president but will not and will never end my support for Zimbabwe, he said. Whoever is my successor will continue and takeover the work.\n\n",
