            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nLISTED pipes and fittings manufacturers, Proplastics Limited, have blamed the implementation of tight Monetary Policy for ZWG shortages, which have hit the business flows.\n\nWhile credited for relative exchange rate stability, which has seen exchange rates hovering between ZWG26 to ZWG32, experts believe the current stability is stage-managed and risks going haywire in the event of the Treasury removing the tight grip on money supply.\n\nEchoing similar sentiments this week, despite a promising start to the quarter, the environment remains constrained by liquidity issues, low economic activity and increasing power disruptions.\n\nThe tight monetary policy measures currently in place have resulted in the scarcity of the local currency, with the resulting slowing in Government projects. Whilst the exchange rate and inflation have been brought under control, the availability of ZWG remains limited, thereby negatively impacting potential revenue streams, the company said.\n\nProplastics said the increase in the foreign currency surrender requirement from 25% to 30% for exports has not only eroded the competitiveness of our exports but has also negatively impacted overall market positioning and exporting viability.\n\nRevenue for the first quarter was primarily received in US$, with US$ payments dominating transactions throughout the period.\n\nIn the current quarter, the formal market, particularly the retail sector, the company made appeals for a reduction in the cost of doing business and the removal of informal sector advantages.\n\nDespite the prevailing liquidity issues, the quarterly sales volumes grew by 11% over the prior period. Revenue grew by 3% to US$4,263 million against US$4,123 million achieved in the prior period, without any export contribution recorded in the current quarter.\n\nProduction volumes also increased by 11% against the previous period, as the business cleared supply backlogs and replenished stocks for high-demand products. The raw material supply remained consistent throughout the quarter.\n\n",

In contrast, domestic tourism has experienced a slight decline.\n\nKey source markets driving international interest in Victoria Falls include Europe, particularly the United Kingdom, Ireland, and Germany, largely due to the availability of dedicated tour packages, said Farawo, adding that South Africa continues to be the largest source of visitors, followed closely by Botswana.\n\nEnhanced accessibility through the expansion of Victoria Falls International Airport, along with the introduction of new flight routes, including direct flights from Frankfurt, has further facilitated the growing interest among German tourists, he said.\n\nThe implementation of the KAZA UniVisa, which simplifies cross-border travel between Zimbabwe and Zambia, has also played a role in encouraging visitors to explore both sides of the falls, offering a more seamless travel experience for tourists from many countries, Farawo added.\n\nLocated on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe, Victoria Falls is one of the worlds largest waterfalls, renowned for its rich biodiversity in flora and fauna.\n\n",

Ordinarily, I would say, please go and see Farai but Farai from Faramatsi Motors, Club Chambers Showroom along 4th Street will come to you and deliver your 2025 brand new Toyota Land Cruiser 300 Series VXR which is fully paid for and ready for delivery, subject to the Churchs Governing Boards consent.Furthermore, please accept USD250,000 in CASH for fuel and your personal use, Chivayo wrote on his Facebook account Monday, attaching a video clip of the vehicle in question.\n\nIt remains to be seen if ZAOGA church leadership will approve of Chivayos donation, given the raging fury over his controversial wealth.\n\nChivayo said he was moved to honour Guti in death because he was a man whom he turned to in difficult times, and largely because he left a gospel seed that continues to positively impact the lives of millions of people across the globe.\n\nI wish to honor a distinguished man, a humble servant of God whom I had the privilege to call Father. A man I would turn to in times of sorrow, in times of distress, in times of seeking divine clarity. A man whose voice of calm would quiet the storms within me and many others, he said.\n\nChivayo also said he honours Guti for standing with the government during turbulent times as he offered prayers and guidance.\n\nHe stood with the Government through every phase of our nations difficult evolution, offering prayers, wisdom and guidance. Wherever he went, he spoke glowingly of Zimbabwe, just as passionately as he spoke about the Bible. In every word he preached and every step he took, he upheld the values of humility, unity, prayer, hard work and divine purpose, he said.\n\n",

Businesses are moving away from traffic congestion, parking space shortages and unsatisfactory building conditions, such as malfunctioning elevators and air-conditioning systems in the CBD, he said.\n\nMoyo said recent local plans, such as the Avondale and E.D. Mnangagwa Road Local Development Plans, have also influenced demand as they permit mixed-use developments along major arterial roads.\n\nDuring the period, the Groups Net Property Income increased by 62% to US$4,842,676, while revenue was up 31% to US$9,027,117 as rental income remained the main source of revenue.\n\nRevenue growth was driven by growth in property services income, predominantly project management fees, an upsurge in pure US dollar rentals, and timely rental reviews.\n\nDue to tenants financial challenges, rental collection rates fell from 85% in 2023 to 75% in 2024. Management is working closely with tenants to resolve the arrears.\n\nManagement will continue to adapt its strategies to protect shareholder value and sustain business operations. Prudent capital management, stakeholder engagement, effective utilisation of the available lettable space (occupancy levels), quality and ambience of our property portfolio will be prioritized, added Moyo.\n\n",

Section 61 does not in any way exonerate the accused in court. There are limitations on section 61, and nothing was said on the limitations.\n\nTransmission of data messages of incitement does not in any way favour him in light of the limitations in section 61, Chirenje said.\n\n",

Even that communicationwe are still waiting for it to come formally. Nothing as yet. Hence, we are still in the trenches. The strike is indefinite, AUT spokesperson Obvious Vengeyi told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nLecturers are demanding that their salaries be pegged at US$2,250, which they argue is on par with other higher education institutions in the region.\n\nThey are also bemoaning incapacitation, which has forced them to use personal resources to conduct lessons.\n\nIn a show of defiance, the lecturers have withdrawn from attending meetings, invigilating and marking examinations.\n\nIn an earlier statement, the lecturers said they had been frustrated by the slow pace of the government and UZ in addressing their plight.\n\nDespite prolonged engagement over 18 months, the employer and the minister have failed to meet AUTs demands or make any reasonable alternative offer, resulting in the issuance of a Certificate of No Settlement.\n\nThe dispute remains unresolved, and lecturers and their families are languishing in extreme poverty, with a net monthly salary of less than US$250 and ZiG 6,000a sum from which the employer harshly and unfairly expects employees to subsidise it by providing personal property as tools of work, including laptops, smartphones, data, and transport to and from work, read the letter.\n\n",
