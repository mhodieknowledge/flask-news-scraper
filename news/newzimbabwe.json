            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nPRESIDENT Emmerson Mnangagwa has assented to two Bills paving way for government ministries to access their 2025 National Budget allocations approved by Parliament.\n\nThrough a notice in an Extraordinary Government Gazette last week, Treasury said the Finance and the Appropriation bills were now law.\n\nThe Appropriation Act authorises most of governments spending for the year while other legislation such as the Finance Act, among others, can also be used to justify expenditure.\n\nA total of ZiG276.4 billion National Budget was presented to Parliament last November but was yet to be disbursed awaiting due process, which includes the assenting of Bills by the President.\n\nThe allocated budget can now find its way into the line Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) after applications for the funds are submitted to the Finance ministry.\n\nSport, Recreation, Arts and Culture ministry acting secretary Euginea Chidhakwa told Sport Portfolio committee acting chairperson (then) Farai Jere (now chairperson of the Sport portfolio committee) that her ministry got a salaries allocation without anything for programmes to the tune of ZiG908.8 million.\n\nThe government is hoping to increase its income/revenue base through a raft of taxes that were introduced by Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube last November.\n\nThe informal sector is now heavily taxed after going for decades without paying taxes to the government.\n\nThose into sport betting will now pay a 10 percent tax of their winnings deducted when they are paid out and sent to the Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) by the betting house, which will themselves pay three percent of their gross monthly income.\n\nA half percent surcharge is now being charged on the sale value of less healthy fast foods that include burgers, pizza, chips, chicken and doughnuts among others that will be announced in regulations to be published later.\n\nA 20 percent surcharge now applies on the sale value of non-renewable plastic carrier bags whether manufactured locally or imported.\n\nSome of the taxes were heavily criticised by Members of Parliament and the public.\n\nNcube, presenting his budget said, The year 2024 has been an extraordinary year, presenting both challenges and opportunities. The challenges have impacted on the economy, peoples lives and progress towards achieving the nations Vision 2030 of becoming an upper middle-income society.\n\nThe economy has, however, shown remarkable resilience, reflecting governments successful implementation of strategic reforms and policies since 2018.\n\nDuring National Budget debates in Parliament, most lawmakers were concerned about the mining and agriculture sectors, saying the expansion of the two meant employment creation (with a double digit) and economic growth.\n\nLands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development was allocated ZiG22,9 billion.\n\nAlso, the issue of mining royalties and taxes took a centre stage as legislators felt government was not realising many dividends from the mining industry.\n\nWe need more exploration allocations and indicate some new mining areas to boost revenue for the country, said an MP during one of the Bills debates at New Parliament Building in Mt Hampden last year.\n\nMines ministry was allocated ZiG764.8 million.\n\nThe Primary and Secondary Education ministry got the highest vote pegged at ZiG46,7 billion. The portfolio has faced problems whereby the Better Education Assistance Module (BEAM) programme has not been funded adequately in the past decade.\n\nLast year, BEAM beneficiaries reportedly failed to sit for their Ordinary and Advanced Level ZIMSEC exams for non-payment of fees due to late disbursements.\n\nHealth and Child Care was allocated a mere ZiG28,8 billion but considering challenges being faced by public health institutions in the country, the allocated funds by Parliament are not adequate for the year.\n\nZimbabwe health sector is supported by donor funds but still, even councils are failing to buy baby cards for the newly born babies as well as syringes.\n\nFinance ministry got ZiG28,7 billion while the Ministry of Defence was allocated ZiG18,05 billion.\n\nThe Public Service ministry was allocated a mere ZiG10,7 billion although the portfolio has a huge burden to cater for the vulnerable groups, which includes the pensioners and orphans.\n\nTransport and Infrastructure Development was allocated ZiG5,4 billion while the Parliament of Zimbabwe got ZiG2,7 billion.\n\nThe 2025 Budget comprises ZiG234 688 015 000 in expected revenues charged to the Consolidated Revenue Fund and ZiG6 248 797 000 in retention funds that are meant for specific purposes as provided for by the Public Finance Management Act.\n\n",

Thats a good reason to tow away that car and the driver to pay a heavy fine.\n\nWe hope further investigations will be conducted and bring the officers on that roadblock to book for allowing such a car to pass, said Mapiya.\n\nJerry Maguranyanga said for years he took pride in ZRP as a top policing organisation in Africa but the level of corruption is becoming more apparent.\n\nCarlos Mufiri concurred with Mapuranga, noting the graft was increasingly contributing to road carnage.\n\nZRP is very toxic. All the police officers at roadblocks along the above-mentioned road knew about the 13 passengers in the car but the driver just paid his way, said Mufiri.\n\nThirteen passengers, you are not working you guys. What are the reasons for your roadblocks?\n\nStakeholders interviewed by NewZimbabwe.com in Mashonaland West province called on government to ban pirate taxis plying various routes and introduce regulated conventional buses.\n\nThere are pirates that ply the Chinhoyi-Chegutu route while others transit between the provincial capital and Harare, Karoi, Mhangura and other outlying areas such as Kenzamba, Makonde district.\n\nWHAT HAS GIVEN RISE TO PIRATE TAXIS\n\nSince September last year, 13,886 motorists have been arrested nationwide for operating pirate taxis, an indicator of how rampant pirates are in Zimbabwe.\n\nUnregistered taxis have been part of Zimbabwes transportation system for years, but they have increased since the coronavirus pandemic as other legal means of transport fell away, according to the Ministry of Transport and Infrastructural Development.\n\nIn 2020, to enforce lockdown measures and discourage people from leaving their homes, the government outlawed the countrys most dependable means of transport: licensed and privately owned omnibuses, minivan taxis  locally known as kombis  and smaller cabs. Only public buses, which are few and unreliable, were allowed to operate.\n\nThe ban was lifted in December 2022 but several private operators that had disposed of their vehicles struggled to get back into business. As a result, pirate taxis still dominate the public transportation sector.\n\nDespite various public awareness campaigns to educate passengers on the dangers of using illegal taxis, illegal taxis continue to thrive.\n\nThe demographic and geographical growth of Zimbabwean cities has put pressure on public transportation services, according to research from the Harare-based nonprofit Zimbabwe Coalition on Debt and Development (ZIMCODD).\n\nZimbabwes population has increased by 16.2% and now stands at 15.1 million people, up from the 13 million in the 2012 census.\n\nWhen there is population growth, our cities then also expand, says Cynthia Huni, an urban planning expert.\n\nYou see new suburbs being opened, and when that happens you have to create new roads and transport systems.\n\nWhile the lack of reliable public transport has created new opportunities for an informal market, Passenger Association of Zimbabwe (PAZ) president, Tafadzwa Goliati believes the influx of pirate taxis also stems from the countrys economic hardships characterised by high unemployment.\n\nThere is general poverty and joblessness in this country and people are not earning much to survive, so they find alternatives to make ends meet  and pirate taxis is one of those means, Goliati says.\n\nADVOCACY FOR JAILING OF MUSHIKASHIKA DRIVERS, OPERATORS\n\nJust like commuter omnibuses were outlawed for causing road traffic accidents, some stakeholders are also calling on the government to deal harshly with mushikashika and jail those who operate them.\n\nLast September, government implemented the radius-based restrictions for commuter omnibuses from 120 km to 60 km, a move aimed at improving road safety on the countrys major roads.This applied to commuter omnibuses with a seating capacity of 26 passengers and below.\n\nTransport and Infrastructural Development Minister Felix Mhona said the move was aimed at mitigating against road traffic accidents involving kombis.\n\nThe minister argued that high-capacity buses had greater leg space and baggage space for long-distance travellers than kombis, which makes buses more ideal for long-distance journeys.\n\nA member of Women Coalition of Zimbabwe (WiCOZ), Mary-Anne Mutsambi said besides being sexually violated in crammed pirate taxis, the speeding vessels put the lives of breadwinners at high risk of leaving their children orphaned.\n\nI am personally advocating for a total ban on mushikashika and incarceration of drivers and owners. Pirate taxis have become death traps, and we are needlessly losing lives and limbs daily.\n\nThe pirates are notorious for overloading passengers like sardines, speeding, hailing insults and profanities as well as flouting road rules and regulations with abandon recklessness at the expense of passengers lives and wellbeing, therefore imprisonment of drivers and operators is the only way to make our roads safer and saner, said Mutsambi.\n\n",

From time-to-time we were now sending food, medication and lotions but it was not enough, cancer kept growing.\n\nThe current drought made things worse for them, that even in her state she would try to go for piece jobs until around June 2024 when she was now bedridden.\n\nShe endured extreme pain during her last days. Because she didnt get sunscreen, early screening and treatment we lost her, an emotional Tshuma said.\n\nThe activist also bemoaned neglect from the government and called for the establishment of regular skin cancer screenings, at least twice a year.\n\nShe is also lobbying for hospitals and clinics to have at least one staffer professionally trained in albinism-related health issues.\n\nl am traumatised because of what l see in the countryside, brothers and sisters dying without treatment. The fundraisers we do are only a drop in the ocean.\n\nThe Government of Zimbabwe has abdicated its duty especially to my community of persons with albinism.\n\nWe need regular skin screening at least two times a year. Hospitals and clinics must have at least one health professional knowledgeable about albinism and skin cancer for early referrals, she added.\n\nChigovas passing shows the harsh reality for many in rural Zimbabwe, where treatable and preventable illnesses often lead to death because of neglect.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nTHE new Commissioner-General of Police, Stephen Mutamba this Friday officially took over the reins of the countrys police service at a colourful ceremony held in Harare.\n\nMutamba replaced Godwin Matanga, who was retired on January 1, 2025.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa, for unknown reasons, recently retired Matanga and elevated his deputy to assume overall leadership at Police General Headquarters (PGHQ).\n\nSpeaking during a handover-and-takeover event at Mkushi Depot (formerly Morris Depot) in Harare this Friday, Matanga dispelled rumour that he wanted to cling on to his lofty post citing irregularities in his retirement procedure.\n\nMatanga said he was properly served with notice of his retirement by Mnangagwas office, quashing rumour that he had reported for duty after his dismissal from the service.\n\nMay l take this opportunity to clarify an incorrect position that has been peddled in the media recently pertaining to my retirement.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, listen carefully, I was properly served by the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe, His Excellency Cde Dr. E.D. Mnangagwa at a time when my retirement was due, he explained.\n\nHis utterances cleared the air after social media reported the outgoing police chief had dramatically reported for duty, claiming he was not properly dismissed.\n\nThe outgoing police chief said he was delighted to address officers and officials witnessing the change of guard.\n\nFor me personally, it is a boundless moment of delight as I bid farewell to longstanding colleagues to an organisation that I served over a long period of time.\n\nAlas, the day will certainly come when we have to separate from the organisation that we have so much and equally drew a lot of friendships, experiences and livelihoods\n\nAllow me, therefore, to express my heartfelt gratitude to His Excellency the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe Cde Emmerson Dambudzo Mnangagwa for according me the privilege to serve the nation in the Office of the Commissioner General Police.\n\nHe added: I am grateful for his guidance and indeed the security infrastructure for their enduring support during my tenure. More importantly, my sincere gratitude goes to the general public of Zimbabwe, my regional peers and the regional police chiefs and the media for the support they rendered to my tenure.\n\nI am, however, confident that a new broom sweeps clean, and my successor will be able to ride on my achievements that we have made and tackle existing challenges head on.\n\nI am comforted to pass the baton to Cde Stephen Mutamba whom l have been with in the trenches for so many years and have known his capacity to steer the ship going forward.\n\nMatanga thanked all the deputy Commissioner Generals and junior ranking cops for their unwavering support during his tenure.\n\nI wish to also thank all senior officers and junior officers and members of the police service who shared and advanced the vision of the organisation through the provision of quality police service to the people of our great nation, he added.\n\nI am so content with the contribution and service l gave to the country in pursuit of national goals and aspirations.\n\nIn attendance at the historic handover-and-takeover ceremony was Home Affairs Minister Kazembe Kazembe, State Security Minister Lovemore Matuke, CIO boss Isaac Moyo, Army Commander Anselem Sanyatwe and Air Marshall Jacob Nzvede.\n\nPrior to the Friday event, an organisation claiming to represent children of war veterans, COZWA, made sensational allegations that Matanga reported at his Harare offices in full police uniform arguing he was yet to receive official communication of his marching orders.\n\nCOZWA proceeded to make sensational claims that the polices Support Unit, Alpha Troop had been put on standby to forcibly remove him from office.\n\n",
