The churches urged leaders to prioritize transparency, accountability, inclusivity, and the rights of marginalized Zimbabweans.\n\nAs the church, we advocate for the upholding of the constitution, the rule of law, and good governance. This necessitates a commitment to transparency and accountability in governance.\n\nWe urge the government and all leaders to ensure that policies promote inclusivity and protect the rights of all Zimbabweans, particularly the marginalized, ZCC said.\n\nThe constitution and democracy have become tools for enriching a few elites, with those responsible for upholding them failing the nation, leading to a loss of trust in political leadership and state institutions.\n\nAs a country, we find ourselves in a situation where our constitution and constitutional democracy have become nothing more than instruments of protecting and enriching a few individuals, devoid of significance for the vast majority and the ethos of Zimbabwes war of liberation.\n\nThose entrusted with upholding our constitution are failing the nation. Our trust in political leadership across the political divide has eroded, along with our confidence in the state institutions of our democracy, parliament and the judiciary.\n\n",

True cadres of the party are clear on the correct line of our revolution, our party history, our values and our traditions.\n\nDo not be clouded or led by wolves in sheeps clothing abusing our rich liberation heritage for their own divisive ends. Loyal Zanu PF members by day and ZANU PF by night not merely when its convenient but you must remain loyal day or night. Sleep or awake, not when it is convenient.\n\nAt no time should we as the leadership question you about your sense of commitment, your sense of duty and loyalty. Any efforts of this nature must never find space in our Party and progressive political culture. We must expose and reject those with tendencies of political grandstanding, including their accessories, said Mnangagwa.\n\nDespite Mnangagwas public declaration that he will not seek re-election after the expiry of his constitutionally mandated two terms, a faction supporting him is pushing for him to rule until 2030.\n\nOpposition Members of Parliament have been roped into the plan to push for the amendment of the constitution to pave the way for the extension of Mnangagwas rule. Some cabinet ministers, such as Daniel Garwe and Jenfan Muswere, have been vocal in support of the extension of Mnangagwas tenure.\n\nThis has caused factional strife within Zanu PF, with some war veterans, led by the partys Central Committee member and war vet Blessed Geza, calling on Mnangagwa to resign.\n\nAdded Mnangagwa, Over and above this, defending our Party and promoting its ideals remains a moral imperative and a practical necessity. All structures of the Party must, therefore, be vigilant and stand firm in safeguarding our revolutionary foregrounding.\n\nThis is more so given that the neo-colonial agenda is focusing on corrupting as well as consuming the minds and hearts of our people, he said.\n\n",

This means that 30% will be paid in local currency, said Davenish.\n\nHowever, farmers who spoke to NewZimbabwe.com expressed grave concerns over the RBZ policy directive to retain 30% of US$ earnings for the farmers and pay the equivalent at the official exchange rate.\n\nAll the implements are priced strictly in US. We owe some product suppliers who expect payment in foreign currency, and yet the central bank will withhold 30% of our US$ earnings. This will even impinge our planning modalities for the coming season, said one farmer on the condition of anonymity.\n\nAcknowledging the overwhelming concerns on foreign currency retention thresholds, Davenish committed to continuously engage the RBZ over the matter.\n\nAs a Board, we will continue to lobby that the RBZ hears the cries of tobacco growers. We value them because they are our primary stakeholders, and their viability is at the epicenter of what we do, he said.\n\nDavenish called on farmers to place environmental sustainability at the heart of their operations by adopting environmentally responsible practices throughout the value chain.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nMOVEMENT for Democratic Change (MDC-T) president Douglas Mwonzora is seething with anger after the High Court nullified the opposition partys 2022 ordinary congress.\n\nMwonzora says Zanu PF was behind the ruling in order to pacify his calls for Zimbabweans to resist President Emmerson Mnangagwas 2030 agenda to extend his incumbency beyond the constitutionally permissible two terms that expire in 2028.\n\nHigh Court judge Justice Hapias Zhou last week ordered Mwonzora to resign and pave way for a fresh congress within six months due to irregularities in the 2022 MDC-T Extraordinary Congress that catapulted him to the helm of the party.\n\nResponding to the ruling, Mwonzora took aim at Zanu PFs Mnangagwa and his 2030 agenda proponents.\n\nI want to say we are going to attenuate our fight against the 2030 agenda. We will never allow anybody to intimidate us against fighting the 2030 agenda.\n\nSo, if there is a faction within Zanu PF which has a hand in this judgment, we say tough luck to you. We are going to intensify our fight against the 2030 agenda. We will never allow the emasculation of our Constitution, we will never allow being bullied against defending our Constitution, charged Mwonzora.\n\nHe said his party was a stakeholder of the 2013 Constitution of Zimbabwe, having participated in its drafting while Zimbabweans owned it after giving their opinions during the consultative process and referendum.\n\nThe people of Zimbabwe are stakeholders, they spoke during the outreach programme about what they wanted in the Constitution. They spoke during the referendum on what they wanted in this Constitution. What they said they wanted in this Constitution was that a President must run the country for a maximum of 10 years, after which they must go home.\n\nWe are saying, President Mnangagwa, after the expiry of your term in 2028, go home, and nothing is going to intimidate us from this path, said Mwonzora.\n\nMwonzora claimed MDC-T had consummated a coalition with other progressive forces, including political parties, the church, civil society, and war veterans to push back against Mnangagwas ambitious plan to be life president.\n\nTurning to the courts ruling that MDC-T must hold fresh polls to choose new leaders, Mwonzora said he was ready to defend his positionas leaderthrough the ballot.\n\nwhen the time comes, we will hold congress and l, as president of the MDC-T am willing to face anyone in a congress. I am willing to face Mudzuri, anybody, in congress, and we all know what the outcome of the congress will be. We know they will be defeated, Zanu PF knows that they will be defeated, Mwonzora added.\n\nAt the 2020 extraordinary congress, Mwonzora annihilated Thokozani Khupe, Elias Mudzuri and Morgen Komichi, who were also vying for the MDC-T presidency. Before vote counting could start, Khupe and Komichi walked out, accusing Mwonzoras camp of using violence and a fraudulent voters roll. Mudzuri also left the congress shortly after.\n\nDespite the protests, voting continued into the night, and Mwonzora was declared the opposition president with 883 votes, Khupe got 118 votes, Mudzuri scrapped 14, and Komichi a paltry 9 votes.\n\nOn December 18, 2022, the MDC-T held an ordinary congress where the party endorsed Mwonzora as its sole presidential candidate for the 2023 general elections. The congress also confirmed Chief Ndlovu as the first vice president and Paurina Mpariwa as the second vice president, both of whom were unopposed.\n\nMudzuri and three other applicants later filed a case in the High Court, challenging the validity of the 2020 congress and seeking an order for a fresh congress.\n\nLast Friday, February 28, 2025, Justice Zhou handed a surprise ruling declaring that the 2022 congress was null and void arguing that it fell short of meeting requirements of the MDC-T Constitution.\n\nThe purported National Congress held in December 2022 by the second respondent as the National Congress of the first respondent be and is hereby declared null and void for noncompliance with the first respondents Constitution, part of the ruling reads.\n\nThe court ordered that a new national congress be held within six months, under an independent election commission as stipulated in the MDC-T Constitution.\n\n",

Politically, instead of focusing on bread-and-butter issues, we are caught up in distractions such as the Third term conversations. Something that has brought with it divisions and unnecessary diversions from the things that do matter.\n\nEconomically, we are not faring well. Businesses are closing, and many people are losing their jobs. The few who are still lucky to be working are burdened under the regime of taxes.\n\nCorruption is rampant and seems tobe out of control. At the rate at which it is taking place, cutting through various sectors, the nation isdoomed. One wonders why the corrupt seemuncensoredand even rewarded whilsthemorrhagingthe nation, the letter reads.\n\nThe bishops criticized economic policies for favoring the elite while most Zimbabweans struggle with poverty.\n\nIt must be said that in our society there is an ever-widening gap between the poor and the rich.\n\nFew individuals seem to be benefiting from the wealth of the nation. We would like to remind our people that Poverty in the world today is not simply a misfortune, bad luck or inevitable -the result of laziness or ignorance or a lack of development. Poverty in the world today is the direct result of political and economic policies of governments, political parties, and big business.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nA local workers rights group has called on the National Social Security Authority (NSSA) to consider processing early payments for workers in the wake of rampant job cuts.\n\nAccording to the International Labour Organisation (ILO), the unemployment rate is around 20%, with records showing that formal employment has been depleting over the years, leaving many citizens in the informal sector where salaries are often low.\n\nDespite government efforts to ease the situation, formalisation continues to spiral out of control, creating untold carnage which has forced several companies to fold operations, leaving many jobless.\n\nThe Commercial Workers Union of Zimbabwe (CWUZ) General Secretary, Cuthbert Chikwekwete, implored NSSA to adjust its operations in line with obtaining trends on the job markets.\n\nThe way in which NSSA is operating urgently needs to be transformed in line with job market dynamics. Currently, most workers in our sector and Zimbabwe in general are losing their jobs way before the retirement age, he said.\n\nThe CWUZ leader said that due to the pressing situation and the rampant job cuts, very few of those who lose their jobs will manage to secure new employment, with some not even getting a job again until they surpass retirement age.\n\nIt is therefore against this background that we implore relevant authorities to urgently compel NSSA to consider processing payouts earlier rather than waiting for one to reach the retirement age. This will go a long way to assist the affected workers to raise funds and venture into other self-sustaining projects, he said.\n\nChikwekwete said the situation bedevilling axed workers is very dire with risks of exposing such workers to chronic and mental health illnesses.\n\nNSSAs intervention by processing timely payments will go a long way to alleviate such kinds of negative impacts, he added.\n\n",
