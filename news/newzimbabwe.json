            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE 22nd Zanu PF Annual National Peoples Conference, which kicks off tomorrow, 14 October, and runs until the 18th, is set to gobble a staggering US$4 million at a time ordinary citizens are wallowing in poverty.\n\nThe yearly feast, characterised by pomp and fanfare, is a display of extravagance at which the partys top leaders flaunt their wealth, dressed in designer suits and driving fuel-guzzling vehicles while sipping on expensive champagne.\n\nZanu PF National Chairperson Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri told State media that all is set for the indaba in Mutare, which will chew millions to transport and host delegates.\n\nShe confirmed that nearly US$4 million had been mobilised for the successful hosting of the National Peoples Conference, with US$2 million having been provided by the ruling partys elite.\n\nI would like to report that we have raised adequate resources. As we speak, as the Zanu PF leadership and well-wishers, we have raised almost US$4 million, with US$2 million coming from the leadership, Muchinguri-Kashiri was quoted saying.\n\nThey have surpassed all our expectations, so thank you to Zanu PF Manicaland. Last week, I reported that we only had 5 percent (of preparations) to attend to, to make sure that we are 100 percent ready.\n\nI can safely say we are good to go. Everything is 100 percent ready. We are all ready to go. The first is the well-furnished main hall. The offices were also not quite ready, but now they are ready, well-furnished, and we are very happy, said Muchinguri-Kashiri.\n\nShe hinted that the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) had been ordered to ensure uninterrupted power supplies throughout the conference. All roads leading to the venue have been rehabilitated, while enough food has also been made available.\n\nThe party national chairperson added that leftovers after feeding 5,000 delegates will be donated to hospitals, orphanages and other institutions that require assistance, as is tradition.\n\nAll the food; in fact, we can feed 10,000 people from the donations that were made, she said.\n\nThe traditional Zanu PF indaba brings together the nations top leaders and thousands of provincial leaders to discuss and endorse decisions. This time around, expectations are high that a faction behind President Emmerson Mnangagwas term extension will use the event to rubber-stamp the position.\n\nMnangagwa, now aged 83, is Zanu PFs First Secretary giving him the mandate to lead all meetings during the National Peoples Conference at Mutare Polytechnic College this week.\n\nThis weeks Zanu PF itinerary at the annual showcase begins with a Politburo meeting tomorrow, Tuesday, followed by a Central Committee sitting on Wednesday, with both being held in Harare.\n\nOther highlights during the conference will include commissioning of the Mega Market Milling Plant by Mnangagwa as well as opening of the Ministry of Health and Child Care-constructed National Pharmaceutical Warehouse situated at Victoria Chitepo Provincial Hospital.\n\nThe octogenarian leader will also launch the national tree-planting initiative by leading the exercise at the site where the new Zanu PF Provincial offices will be built, adjacent to the conference venue.\n\n",

This programme focuses on repairing a significant portion of the road network, aiming to improve safety, stimulate economic activity, and connect communities to essential services like health, education, and markets.\n\nTo date, major road uplifts have been undertaken along the countrys major highways to revamp the countrys roads infrastructure.\n\nIn a statement, the MoTID announced that Glenara Road will not be accessible due to ongoing works.\n\nThe MoTID wishes to notify the motoring public and residents of the temporary partial closure of a section of Glenara Road to facilitate essential road rehabilitation works.\n\nAs part of the governments ongoing road infrastructure rehabilitation programme, this project aims to enhance road safety drainage and travel conditions for all users, said the ministry in a statement.\n\nThe affected section of Genara Road is between Service Station and Samora Machel Avenue will be partially closed to through traffic.\n\nMotorists travelling from ED Mnangagwa Road were advised to follow the designated detour, which proceeds via Glen Roy, turns onto Sloane Street, continues on Montgomery Road, then onto Rhodesville Avenue and finally rejoins Glenara Road via Samora Machel Avenue.\n\nProperties within the construction zone will remain accessible, with traffic management personnel on site to assist residents and businesses. To ensure the safety of all motorists and construction personnel and facilitate a smooth flow of traffic, the ministry strongly advises the public to obey all posted traffic signs and instruction from officials, drive with caution and at reduced speeds through the affected area, and allow for extra travel time to their schedules, the ministry added.\n\n",

Unfortunately, her condition continued to deteriorate, leading to her death on 5th October 2025, ZRP national spokesperson, Commissioner Paul Nyathi said in a statement.It was during the childs burial when rumour started circulating that the deceased may have been poisoned leading villagers to alert Chief Ziki, who then instructed the victims mother to report the case to the police.Following investigations Gamera implicated Kwanga as the person who advised her to poison the child as well as Tavengerarwei as the supplier of the poison.Police have since recovered rat poison and a liquid substance suspected to be a cotton pesticide, believed to have been used in the commission of the offence.Meanwhile, the body of the victim has been exhumed and taken to Silveira Mission Hospital mortuary for a post-mortem examination.Nyathi urged members of the public to resolve disputes through lawful and peaceful means.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) confirmed that Sabina Maziva (4) died a week ago after she was allegedly fed the poisoned food by a neighbour, Violet Gamera (60), who accused the childs parents of letting their goats stray and destroy her crops.\n\nGamera, along with Chamunorwa Kwanga (60) and Regina Tavengerarwei (30), have since been arrested as police continue investigating the suspected murder.Initial investigations reveal that on 1st October 2025, Violet Gamera allegedly gave the victim poisoned rice as an act of revenge against the childs parents, whose goats had previously destroyed her crops.The child later began vomiting and was referred to a local clinic, where she received medical attention.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nFUGITIVE war veteran, Blessed Runesu Geza, also known as Cde Bombshell has called on Zimbabweans to rise against alleged State capture and plunder of natural resources by President Emmerson Mnangagwa and his henchmen.\n\nGeza said citizens must come out and join forces on the streets of Harare to express their anger against the 83-year-old Zanu PF leader, who will be in Mutare attending the partys annual conference where a resolution to extend his incumbency beyond his second and final term in 2028 is expected to be tabled.\n\nIn a video posted on YouTube this weekend, Geza who is dressed in military fatigues at an undisclosed location, declared that the time for silence is over.\n\nThe former Sanyati legislator, who is wanted by authorities on sedition charges, claimed to speak for a faction of disillusioned liberation war fighters frustrated by what he described as economic decay and political betrayal.\n\nFellow Zimbabweans, l come to you when the situation can nolonger be ignored. The situation has now reached a defining moment tasvika kumagumo (we have reached the end), Geza said.\n\nEmmerson has chosen to betray the people of Zimbabwe, aligning himself with his criminal cartels, the Zviganandas. He has opted for corruption, looting and open normalisation of thievery within our very government.\n\nEmmerson has chosen to brutally mutilate our Constitution, massacring the rights of Zimbabweans to the dignity of life through his corrupt machinations. He is the Godfather of corrupt elements, the outspoken ex-guerrilla fighter said.\n\nWe want an uprising from Plumtree to Mutare, from Zambezi to Limpopo. Everyone must flood the streets  Mnangagwa must go, Geza said in the video.\n\nThe call comes as Zimbabwe faces growing political uncertainty, with reports of internal divisions in the ruling Zanu PF party and rising frustration over economic hardships.\n\nGeza noted that the time was ripe for masses to act decisively and end Mnangagwas tyranny and plunder of national coffers put at a staggering US$7 billion.\n\nThe time for our suffering has ended. Today marks the final steps to dismantle this madness. We will nolonger standby and let Emmerson and his Zviganandas rob our people of the future and sacred right to vote in 2028. We will nolonger tolerate the resolution seeking to postpone elections, somehow said to represent the will of the people. This is the gravest insult to the dignity of Zimbabweans.\n\nGeza urged Zimbabweans from all walks of life to participate in streets demonstrations set for next Friday coinciding with the climax of the Zanu PF Annual National Peoples Conference set for Mutare Polytechnic, from 13 to 18, 2025.\n\nOn Friday, 17 October, fellow Zimbabweans, lets say no to State capture by (Kuda) Tagwirei, (Wicknell) Chivayo and their fellow Zviganandas.\n\nLets say no to the looting of our State resources, when civil servants are poorly paid, lets say no to the looting of billions when our people die in hospitals without medication, when our women give birth in open spaces.\n\nThis country doesnt belong to Emmerson, his wife and criminal cartels, declared Geza, who is largely viewed to be bidding for Vice President Constantino Chiwenga to take over the presidency come 2028.\n\nThe struggle must continue until every Zimbabwean is free from tyranny, Geza said.\n\n",
