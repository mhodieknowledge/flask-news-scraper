            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nLEGISLATORS must ensure that public resources are equitably channelled towards programmes designed to improve the livelihoods of the citizenry, Speaker of Parliament, Jacob Mudenda, has said.\n\nOfficially opening a capacity building workshop for Members of Parliament on Budget Analysis for the Public Accounts and Budget and Finance committees respectively in Bulawayo this weekend, Mudenda said the two committees,charged with the sacred responsibility of demanding unwavering standards on the value-for-money across every tier of government expenditure must be actively involved in every step of the budgetary processes, moving beyond perfunctory examination to critical analysis of the national budget.In the past, analysis of the National Budget has been done by others, leaving you as mere spectators in decisions that directly affect the welfare of the people you are sworn to serve.Today, you begin the process of becoming the lion that writes its own story through the mastery of rigorous budget analysis. As the saying goes: Until the lion learns to write, every story will glorify the hunter, Mudenda said.According to the Speaker, pro-poor budgeting, which revolves around a fundamental question regarding every budget allocation: Will this directly improve the life of the poorest family in your constituency?Mudenda highlighted that there was need by members to employ Artificial Intelligence (Al) through database analytics in order to unravel the political economy undergirding the daily lives of the people.He told them that the approach was in consonant with Nelson Mandelas affirmation that: Overcoming poverty is not a task of charity, it is an act of justice. It is the protection of a fundamental human right, the right to dignity and a decent life.This pro-poor approach should align the budget to the Sustainable Development Goals and Agenda 2063, particularly the forte of the elimination of poverty, achieving zero hunger and ensuring sound health and well-being for all.Also, of importance, proficiency in budget analysis demanded a comprehensive understanding of the Public Finance Management (PFM) framework.The PFM system is built on strong legal and institutional foundations which delineate every stage of the budget process namely, from the initial planning and preparation, approval, implementation and expenditure, to the final monitoring and evaluation level of due analysis.Centrally, the framework places fiscal oversight on the committees responsibility to exercise with probity the budgetary processes. This is where you, as Parliamentarians, must step forward to fulfil your hallowed responsibility.The role of Parliament in budget oversight is not a matter of political convenience, executive benevolence or sheer happenstance. It is a constitutional mandate that forms the very juridical foundation of the budgetary processes, stated Mudenda.He reminded members that the Constitution did not just permit them to scrutinise public expenditure but, also commanded them to do so because they must ensure that public resources were expended on programmes designed to improve the livelihoods of the citizenry with greatest equity.The Constitution speaks with crystalline clarity. Section 119(3) states that: all institutions and agencies of the State and government at every level are accountable to Parliament, said the Speaker.Beyond the legal framework which anchors the Select Committees financial oversight, Mudenda said committees must have an appreciation of the national budget matrix.Section 298 provides for principles of public financial management which should act as the beacon for Parliamentary oversight on how public funds ought to be expended prudentially for the sake of democratic accountability.Equally, Section 299 complements Section 298 by specifically obligating Parliament to monitor and oversee expenditure by all State institutions.The primary objective of budget analysis was to identify opportunities for improving the quality and quantity of public spending in counterbalance to the available revenues.Furthermore, international protocols have established standards that can assist in measuring whether Budget allocations truly prioritise the needs of the vulnerable people.The Abuja Declaration calls for 15% of the National Budget to be allocated to health, while the Dakar Declaration of 2000 and the Incheon Declaration require 20% of government expenses to be allocated to education. In the same vein, the Maputo Declaration sets a target of 10% for the agriculture sector, the Speaker explained.However, sometimes these international standards were not met because of negative economic imperatives that may be obtaining in those countries.Mudenda told members that the budget analysis must be guided by the Bill of Rights as provided for in Chapter 4 of the national Constitution.The need to take cognisance of the climate change impact phenomenon, as more resilient, climate-proof infrastructure development demands robust budgetary allocations was of profound importance.\n\nOfficially opening a capacity building workshop for Members of Parliament on Budget Analysis for the Public Accounts and Budget and Finance committees respectively in Bulawayo this weekend, Mudenda said the two committees,\n\ncharged with the sacred responsibility of demanding unwavering standards on the value-for-money across every tier of government expenditure must be actively involved in every step of the budgetary processes, moving beyond perfunctory examination to critical analysis of the national budget.\n\nIn the past, analysis of the National Budget has been done by others, leaving you as mere spectators in decisions that directly affect the welfare of the people you are sworn to serve.Today, you begin the process of becoming the lion that writes its own story through the mastery of rigorous budget analysis.

In the same vein, the Maputo Declaration sets a target of 10% for the agriculture sector, the Speaker explained.However, sometimes these international standards were not met because of negative economic imperatives that may be obtaining in those countries.Mudenda told members that the budget analysis must be guided by the Bill of Rights as provided for in Chapter 4 of the national Constitution.The need to take cognisance of the climate change impact phenomenon, as more resilient, climate-proof infrastructure development demands robust budgetary allocations was of profound importance.\n\nHe reminded members that the Constitution did not just permit them to scrutinise public expenditure but, also commanded them to do so because they must ensure that public resources were expended on programmes designed to improve the livelihoods of the citizenry with greatest equity.\n\nThe Constitution speaks with crystalline clarity.

A drop kick from him saw Zimbabwe move ahead 23-18 with the Simbas now struggling with basic ball-handling errors and knock-ons that proved costly.Prior had another penalty for 26-18 in favour of Zimbabwe and with two minutes to go, his kick extinguished Kenya as the Sables moved ahead 29-18.A last-minute try from Teddy Akala was not enough to rescue Kenya as the referee blew the hooter to leave them crestfallen and out of contention for a place at the World Cup.Zimbabwe will now play Namibia in the Africa Cup final on Saturday July 19 with the winner earning a direct ticket to the World Cup while the losers will try their luck via the repechage.For Kenya, it is back to the drawing board yet again with another missed opportunity as a place at the World Cup proves elusive once more.\n\nKenya Simbas dream of earning an early ticket to the 2027 Rugby World Cup in Australia suffered a major setback when they lost 29-23 to Zimbabwe in the Africa Cup semi-final on Sunday.\n\nKenya took on Zimbabwe in the second semi-final at the Namboole grounds in Kampala knowing a place in the final was a stake against Namibia with the winners of the cup set to seal a ticket to the 2027 World Cup.However, they started off badly as Zimbabwe took an early lead although Kenya pulled one back when Eugene Sifuna touched down for 5-5.Zimbabwe would get a penalty shortly after which was well-converted before Kenya went a man down when Griffin Chao was sinbinned for a rough tackle.Kenya Simbas Let Halftime Lead SlipIn the 19th minute, Jone Kubu converted a penalty for Kenya to level the scores 8-8 but Hilton Mudariki gave the Sables a 13-8 lead following his try.Kubu pulled three points back for Kenya with another well-taken kick for 13-11 and on the stroke of halftime, Simbas went ahead when Chao got into space and ran across the pitch to score a try.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE streets of Leeds in the United Kingdom (UK) roared with the sound of resistance this Saturday as Zimbabwean nationals and solidarity groups marched 15 kilometres through the city in a protest against tyranny by President Emmerson Mnangagwa back home.\n\nOrganised by the Zimbabwe Human Rights Organisation (ZHRO), the demonstrations went ahead undeterred by recent threats from Mnangagwas government, with participants singing revolutionary songs and chanting calls for democratic change, standing defiant in the face of intimidation.\n\nThe walk came in the wake of chilling warnings from Zimbabwean authorities, who have vowed to apply the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Amendment Act (2023) against anyoneinside or outside Zimbabwewho tarnishes the image of the so-called Second Republic. Despite this, participants in Leeds said they would not be silenced.\n\nWe are not afraid, said one marcher.\n\nWe will continue to speak out against corruption, nepotism, and oppression.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) recently confirmed that Blessed Runesu Bombshell Geza, a leading figure in Zimbabwean demonstrations and stay-aways, is now on Interpols watchlist. But rather than deterring action, his listing appears to have further galvanised exiled Zimbabweans and international supporters.\n\nThe march saw enthusiastic participation from a broad coalition of groups, including members of Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), ZAPU, Mthwakazi Republic Party, and others who joined ZHRO in calling for regime change. Under the blazing summer heat, the spirited crowd kept its energy high, drumming and singing all the way.\n\nThere was a roar and thunder in Leeds when drums were beaten by Ettar Mhlanga and Patson Muzuwa, who electrified the atmosphere with energetic drum beating thereby spurring the crowd in a determined move showing that the diaspora community is no longer willing to remain silent.\n\nAmong the organisers of the walk were, Pamela Magwizi, Mgcini Victor Hlophe, Regina Mahowo, Happiness Ncube, Phylis Melody Magejo, Josephine Jenje-Mudimbu and John Burke.\n\nZHRO members in attendance included, Samuel Jambaya, Moses Mbano, Alwyn Mbano, Shepherd Yuda, Shepherd Mungu, Salius Sibanda, Dickson Chikwizo, Henry Makambe, Pretty Ncube, Dadirayi Mukwedeya, Genius Mamwadu, Victor Simon, Denis Gwasira, Philile Dube, Fransisca Chiduku, Ettar Patience Mhlanga, Evy Kangandi, Charles Kanyimo, Tarisai Mapondera, Sandra Chidemo, Jamie Hunter, Milton Bingwa, Dumisani Nyathi, Nobukhosi Dube, and Eness Mapungwana.\n\nCoordinators Petty Ziramba, Patson Muzuwa, Mavis Mutsvangwa and Shepherd Yuda said the Leeds demonstration was part of a global wave of resistance.\n\nIn Canada, solidarity protests were led by activist Mellisa Tonderai Tagarira, while in the United States, 19-year-old Bethel Princess Chiyangwa led a demonstration alongside Panashe Vongai Trish Sivindani. In South Africa Jabulani Ndlovu lead a team of 40 people in their quest to be heard.\n\nThe protestors vowed to continue their campaign until real democratic reform is achieved in Zimbabwe.\n\nFear is no longer an option. We will not stop until our country is free, said one participant.\n\n",
