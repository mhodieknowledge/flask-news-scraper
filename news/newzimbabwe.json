            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nAlpha Media Holdings (AMH) journalist Blessed Mhlanga has been denied bail on appeal by the High Court.\n\nHe is accused of transmitting informationinciting public violence following a press conference bywar veteran Blessed Geza.\n\nHe was denied bail by Magistrate Farai Gwitima, who ruled that if granted bail, Mhlanga was likely to interfere with witnesses who are his junior subordinates.\n\nThe magistrate also said his lawyers were trying to trivialize a huge offence by treating it lightly.\n\nGwitima said his release would trigger anarchy in Zimbabwe.\n\nMhlanga then mounted the present appeal, which was dismissed by the High Court.\n\nIn passing his ruling judge Justice Gibson Mandaza said the lower court was right in concluding that the journalist was likely to interfere with investigations.\n\nMandaza said there was no need to interfere with the lower courts ruling.\n\nMy view is that the appellant lost it when he took the prosecutions view as an attack on his profession.\n\nHe said everyone, including journalists, should know that no one is above the law.\n\nEveryone should know that they are supposed to practice their job within the confines of the law, the judge said, adding that the state was right when it said he transmitted inciting messages.\n\nMandaza said the finding that he transmitted inciting messages cannot be faulted, although it is accepted that he is not Heart and Soul TV.\n\nThe defence had argued that witnesses statements had not been recorded, so releasing Mhlanga would jeopardise investigations.\n\nChris Mhike, representing Mhlanga also said there was no violence following the publication.\n\nThe judge said the charge is about transmission.\n\nIt is not an essential element of the offence that violence should have occurred, he said.\n\nI therefore associate my sentiments with those of the court below that the statement would affect peace and tranquility. Such a finding based on the messages that were circulated cannot be faulted, Mandaza said.\n\nHe said to allege that Mhlanga is being punished for what Geza said was invalid.\n\nI pointed out for the umpteenth time that the charge is not that he uttered the words. The fact that the messages were uttered by Geza does not change the colour of the allegations, said the judge.\n\nMhike said other suspects get bail, and his clients case was not unique.\n\nApplicants should not equate themselves with other accused persons. The law does not say that, said the judge.\n\nMhike said the presumption of innocence still operated in his clients favour because he is yet to be convicted\n\nBut the judge said that what is debatable is that bail is not an absolute right.\n\nBail is not absolute. You cant just say I deserve the constitutions notions.\n\nIts a qualified privilege which can be denied or granted by the court depending on the circumstances as supported by the law.\n\nMhike had also said the magistrate failed to appreciate that Mhlanga handed himself to the police when it denied him bail.\n\nMandaza said this would have worked in favour of Mhlanga if he had been recorded as a flight risk.\n\nOn the issue of interference. He didnt deny that he was a senior reporter.\n\nSurely the prosecution and the police didnt invent his title.\n\nIf that title was anything to go by, it would mean that the appellant wields significant power at HSTV, the judge said.\n\nOn the issue of public security, Mandaza said the court should take it upon itself to weigh the interests of an accused and that of the law to determine the issues of bail.\n\nThere was nothing amiss in the findings by the court aquo that the release of the appellant will undermine peace and security, the judge said.\n\nGiven the above, I have no doubt that the argument by the applicant that the finding of the magistrate was a misdirection is without merit and must be dismissed.\n\nThe ground of appeal should be dismissed. Most of the issues brought up are triable issues. It is my view there was a proper exercise of discretion in denying the appellant bail by the court aquo.\n\nMy conclusion is that .I did not find any misdirection by the court aquo. The appeal cannot succeed, and in the end, the decision of this court is that the appeal of the appellant against the magistrate be and is hereby dismissed in its entirety. Accordingly, this application is dismissed.\n\n",

We apologise for the inconvenience.\n\nFlight tracking website FlightRadar24 said the shutdown would affect at least 1,351 flights.\n\nThere were 120 aircraft in the air set to be diverted to alternate airports or return to their origin at the time of the announcement, according to FlightRadar24.\n\nWere trying to stop passengers from travelling to the airport, and then work with airline partners on flights that are delayed, diverted, or cancelled, a Heathrow spokesperson told Al Jazeera.\n\nThey [passengers] can reach out to airline partners to work on rebooking.\n\nHeathrow is one of the most globally connected airports and regularly ranks among the top five busiest gateways worldwide.\n\nThe airport serves more than 200 destinations in nearly 90 different countries and territories, and last year handled nearly 84 million passengers, the largest number on record.\n\nThe true impact of the closure only began to emerge hours after the announcement as the earliest flights depart from Heathrow at 06:00 GMT.\n\nAs the UK began to wake up early on Friday morning, the ripples of the closure were starting to be felt across Asia.\n\nSingapores Changi airport said in a statement that passengers should check with their airline about the status of upcoming flights.\n\nFootage shared on social media showed an inferno several stories high, lighting up the night sky and emitting massive plumes of black smoke.\n\nThe London Fire Brigade said that it had deployed 10 engines and about 70 firefighters to a fire at an electrical substation near the airport in Hayes, west London.\n\nThis is a highly visible and significant incident, and our firefighters are working tirelessly in challenging conditions to bring the fire under control as swiftly as possible, Assistant Commissioner Pat Goulbourne said in a statement.\n\nThe fire has caused a power outage affecting a large number of homes and local businesses, and we are working closely with our partners to minimise disruption. Firefighters have led 29 people to safety from neighbouring properties, and as a precaution, a 200-metre cordon has been established, with around 150 people evacuated.\n\nGoulbourne said the fire would be a prolonged incident, with crews to remain on scene throughout the night.\n\nAs we head into the morning, disruption is expected to increase, and we urge people to avoid the area wherever possible, he said.\n\nDue to the significant amount of smoke, we strongly advise local residents to keep their windows and doors closed.\n\n",

They have called on Zimbabweans to join.\n\nGeza, whose whereabouts are not public, has been laying into Mnangagwa, his cronies such as Wicknell Chivayo, Kudakwashe Tagwirei, Martin Rushwaya while propping up Chiwenga as the rightful successor to deal with Zimbabwes current mess.\n\nThere are things being said on social media that there will be demonstrations. What I can assure you is that as long as I still deputise Machakaire in this wing there will not be any demonstration, said Paradza to raucous applause from youths in attendance at the Harare International Conference Centre (HICC) on Thursday.\n\nWe do not lose sleep over utterances on social media, we want you to be at peace.\n\nOur duty as the youth league is to defend the President and the party.\n\nGeza, who has demanded Mnangagwas immediate resignation, was on Thursday described as delusional by information minister Jenfan Muswere. Zanu PF quickly moved to fire Geza from the party after his first few public utterances.\n\nZimbabweans are encouraged to ignore Gezas delusional rumblings, polemic and reactionary grandstanding is a clear misdirection of ambition, said Muswere.\n\nFactional fights within Zanu PF have seen former allies Mnangagwa and Chiwenga being pitted against each other as the party approaches its elective congress in 2027.\n\nChiwenga, whom many had been made to believe will take over from Mnangagwa, appears to have been dumped despite the central role he played in ensuring Mnangagwas ascent via the 2017 coup.\n\nZanu PF infighting is no longer being played out in the corridors of its headquarters, even party spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa was recorded laying into Chiwenga.\n\nMutsvangwa described Chiwenga as unelectable, cruel and unlearned.\n\n",

We started to find them because they were running away.\n\nWe had to trace them right into China. So, its not an ownerless and derelict mine; it is a mine operated by a company, Mantashe said.\n\nHe also confirmed that his department will engage with the Minerals Council South Africa to address illegal mining.\n\nMeanwhile, Police Minister Senzo Mchunu assured Parliament that investigations are ongoing to identify those who financially benefit from illegal mining.\n\nWere very much interested in that, and those matters are under investigation. We need to get to the bottom of it all, Mchunu said.\n\nLaw enforcement are also probing the potential involvement of law enforcement officials in theescapeof illegal mining kingpin James Tiger Tsoaeli during the rescue mission.\n\nFour police officers, accused of aiding his escape, have already appeared in court twice.\n\nThey were released onR1 000 bail, with their case scheduled to resume on29 May.\n\nCommenting on their alleged role in the escape, Mchunu remarked, I suppose they were subdued by money.\n\n",

            "content": "By Imraan Buccus | IOL\n\nDebt Thomas Sankara famously argued at the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) in Addis Ababa on 29 July 1987 is a cleverly managed reconquest of Africa.\n\nThe history of the misuse of debt as a form of political control goes back more than two centuries. Haiti, the first independent Black republic in the modern world, was coerced into paying reparations to France for its own freedom, won in 1804 after more than a decade of war against slavery.\n\nThis imposed debt, totalling an estimated $21 billion in todays terms, crippled Haitis economy for over a century. The injustice of this arrangement was not only in its moral absurdity but also in its economic implications, which locked Haiti into cycles of poverty and dependency.\n\nMore recently the Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) implemented across Africa during the 1980s and 1990s by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank devastated many countries.\n\nThese programmes were framed as necessary measures to stabilise economies, reduce debt, and promote development through liberalisation and integration into the global economy. However SAPs represented a form of neo-colonial control that seized control of large areas of policy formulation and prioritised the interests of global financial institutions and Western powers over the well-being of African populations.\n\nSAPs imposed severe austerity measures, including cuts to public spending on essential services such as healthcare, education, and social welfare.\n\nThey also mandated the privatisation of state-owned enterprises, the removal of trade barriers, and the liberalisation of financial markets. While these measures were justified as promoting efficiency and growth, they had devastating consequences for the majority of people.\n\nSAPs led to widespread poverty, unemployment, and inequality.\n\nThe dismantling of state support systems meant that millions of Africans lost access to basic services. Farmers, who were often forced to compete with subsidised agricultural products from the Global North, found their livelihoods destroyed.\n\nIn urban areas, the removal of subsidies on food and fuel led to skyrocketing prices, sparking protests and uprisings across the continent. Women, who often bore the brunt of caring for families and communities, were disproportionately affected by the social and economic dislocation caused by SAPs.\n\nThe emphasis on export-oriented growth and the repayment of external debt trapped many African countries in cycles of dependency.\n\nRather than investing in local development, governments were compelled to prioritise debt servicing, often at the expense of their own populations. This perpetuated a form of economic subjugation that mirrored the extractive relationships of colonial rule.\n\nZimbabwes descent into economic turmoil began in earnest with the implementation of the Economic Structural Adjustment Program (ESAP) in 1991. Mandated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, ESAP was presented as a pathway to liberalise the economy, attract foreign investment, and stimulate growth.\n\nHowever, the programme came with severe austerity measures, including cuts to public spending, removal of subsidies, and the deregulation of industries.\n\nThe immediate impacts of ESAP were devastating. Healthcare and education, two pillars of Zimbabwes post-independence achievements, suffered severe funding cuts. Public sector retrenchments led to widespread unemployment, while the removal of subsidies on basic goods made life unaffordable for the majority.\n\nThe promise of economic growth never materialised, and instead, Zimbabwe became increasingly reliant on external loans to service its growing debt. By the late 1990s, the structural adjustment program had left the economy weakened and the population in a state of profound distress.\n\nAs Zimbabwe grappled with the fallout of structural adjustment, its political landscape became increasingly fraught.\n\nIn 2000 ordinary Zimbabweans, desperate for land, began occupying white owned commercial farms. Seeking to sustain its collapsing legitimacy the Zanu-PF government sought to take over the process of land reform initially driven from below.\n\nIn response, the United States and the European Union imposed sanctions on Zimbabwe. The Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act (ZDERA) of 2001, enacted by the US, imposed a clandestine embargo on Zimbabwe.\n\nIt officially made it US policy to block Zimbabwes access to loans and investment from international financial institutions, such as the IMF and the World Bank. Senior US officials, who hold influential positions in many multilateral institutions, were prohibited under ZDERA from voting to support Zimbabwes financial needs.\n\nThis legislation has not only entrenched Zimbabwes economic isolation but also created significant barriers to recovery, further impoverishing an already struggling population.\n\nUN human rights experts argued that the human rights of ordinary Zimbabweans suffer greatly from the consequences of sanctions, and that sanctions and various forms of over-compliance with sanctions have had an insidious ripple effect on the economy  and on the enjoyment of fundamental human rights.\n\nThese findings underscore how punitive economic measures often harm the most vulnerable populations rather than achieving their stated political objectives.\n\nThe prohibition of debt relief and loans placed Zimbabwe in an economic stranglehold. Without access to international credit, the government struggled to finance development projects or stabilise the economy.\n\nHyperinflation, which reached its peak in 2008, wiped out savings and plunged millions into poverty.\n\nZanu-PF is authoritarian and corrupt but while mainstream Western narratives blame Zimbabwes leadership for the crisis, the role of sanctions in deepening the countrys economic collapse is seldom acknowledged.\n\nIn 2023, President Biden removed Zimbabwe-specific sanctions under the Treasury program. However ZDERA remains in force, blocking debt relief and restricting Zimbabwes access to loans from international financial institutions. Experts estimate that banks lose about $1bn annually in higher bank charges because of ZDERA.\n\nThe lifting of ZDERA and the provision of debt relief are critical steps toward economic recovery. If former white land owners are to be compensated for the expropriation of their farms that money must come from the coffers of the United Kingdom which never made good on its promises to fund reform.\n\nIn July 2020, a compensation deal was signed in Zimbabwe offering $3.5 billion to roughly 4,000 white former landowners for property expropriated in the land reform process of the early 2000s. This agreement was presented as an effort to mend relations with Western powers and restore Zimbabwes access to international financial markets.\n\nZimbabwe continues to grapple with extreme poverty, manifesting in widespread unemployment, chronic hunger, and inadequate income for the majority of its population.\n\nUnemployment is endemic. In 2019 the World Bank reported that as of 2019, 39.8% of Zimbabweans lived below the international poverty line of $2.15 per day, with 85% falling below the upper middle-income poverty line of $6.85 per day.\n\nFood insecurity is also an acute problem. In December last year, the U.N. World Food Programme warned of an impending dry season that could exacerbate hunger for millions already affected by drought. This dire situation has created a cycle of deprivation, deepening inequality and undermining the potential for long-term economic recovery.\n\nHuge numbers of people have had to leave the country to find livelihoods, with South African and the United Kingdom gaining many well educated people.\n\nNow, Zimbabwes government faces a dire ultimatum. US restrictions will not be removed unless the government fulfils its pledge to pay the $3.5 billion to white farmers who profited from colonial rule and post-independence land ownership patterns.\n\nThese billions, amounting to nearly half of Zimbabwes annual revenue, are unattainable for a nation already teetering on economic collapse.\n\nAt a time when Zimbabwe is ranked among the four most food-insecure countries globally and on the brink of man-made starvation, this demand can only deepen the humanitarian crisis.\n\nWhen Zimbabwe gained independence in 1980, the Lancaster House Agreement included a commitment from the United Kingdom to provide funding for land reform.\n\nThis was intended to facilitate a peaceful transition by compensating white farmers and redistributing land to the Black majority who had been dispossessed during colonial rule. However, this promise was not fully honoured.\n\nWhile some initial funds were provided, they fell far short of what was needed to address the land issue comprehensively. By the late 1990s, the UK had withdrawn its financial support for land reform.\n\nThe demand for the Zimbabwean government to pay $3.5 billion to the former white farmers who lost land during the land reform process can only mean that the Zimbabwean people will be further impoverished and Zimbabwes institutions, which are already in crisis, further degraded. If the farmers are to be compensated that money must come from the United Kingdom.\n\nNow that Donald Trump has turned on South Africa, citing possible land reform as well as South Africas position in support of Palestine, we must face the possibility that we may now also face the risk of being subject to sanctions.\n\nA problem once faced by the people of countries such as Cuba, Venezuela and Zimbabwe could conceivable become a crisis for our people too. In this moment it is essential that, while sustaining our critiques of the corrupt and authoritarian regime in Harare, we stand with the Zimbabwean people.\n\nDr Buccus is senior research associate at ASRI.The views expressed here do not necessarily represent those of Independent Media or IOL\n\n",
