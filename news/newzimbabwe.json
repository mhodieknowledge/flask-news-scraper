            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nFORMER Foreign Affairs Minister, Walter Mzembi, has urged the court to cancel his arrest warrant, adding that he was not in wilful default over the past seven years he has been out of the country.\n\nMzembi was arrested when he touched down at Robert Mugabe International Airport over the weekend, accused of skipping court.\n\nWhen he left the country in 2018, Mzembi was on remand following his arrest on allegations of theft of trust property.\n\nIn his application filed before Harare Magistrate Donald Ndirowei on Monday, Mzembi said he has always wanted to have his case finalised, the reason he returned home after a long time, using the proper channels.\n\nHe also said he is battling an ailment which has seen him hospitalised on several occasions, hence he could not return.\n\nOn numerous occasions, he has relapsed and needed alterations and been admitted and reassessed to an extent that this condition remains a life-threatening long-term illness.\n\nDue to travel document requirements, the same accused could not continue to get treatment in South Africa, and the only next medical facility that was capable of properly managing his condition was in Zambia.\n\nIt remains his humble submission that he could not get the necessary treatment locally.\n\nUpon relocation to the same in early 2024, the accuseds condition had seriously deteriorated as he arrived only to be admitted and placed on oxygen for over 10 days. In support of this, I have tendered a detailed report from his current medical team as well as the bill for the duration of his stay as well as pictures of his stay in hospital.\n\nThe accused again remains under the constant care of his medical practitioners of this critical condition I refer to the June report currently attached hereto.\n\nThe accused, feeling much better, then travelled to Zimbabwe to manage these issues and was then arrested at the airport before being awarded an opportunity to submit himself freely to the court.\n\nHe came of his own free will and without coercion or enticement.\n\nHad he been given a chance to, he freely would have come to court to address the warrants of arrest and deal with the matters in their entirety, said his lawyer, Killian Mandiki.\n\nNdirowei is expected to hand down his ruling on Mzembis application this Tuesday.\n\nBefore he left the country, Mzembi told a Harare magistrate, Milton Serima, that he was battling stomach cancer and would be undergoing treatment in South Africa for at least a year.\n\nThe magistrate approved his application for further release of his passport to allow for the frequent trips to South Africa for a check-up.\n\nThe ex-minister produced a supporting letter from a South African medical specialist who indicated that he will be required to return for post-operative reviews.\n\nHe told the court that he was hospitalised in an intensive care unit on the day he was supposed to attend court. The warrant was cancelled.\n\nMzembi was then represented by his lawyer, Job Sikhala.\n\nBack then, the lawyer tried to keep Mzembis medical condition under wraps by requesting that the case be held in camera, but the application was turned down.\n\nMzembi is accused of stealing US$1,6 million, among other charges, when he was still the Tourism and Hospitality Minister.\n\nHe was being charged together with Tourism and Hospitality ministry consultant Aaron Dzingira Mushoriwa(62)and the ex-permanent secretary Margret Sangarwe(59).\n\nProsecutors allege that when he stole US$1,6 million in donations from Mbada Diamonds and Zimplats, Mzembi and his accomplices bought themselves top-of-the-range vehicles.\n\nThe ex-minister is facing theft of trust property as well as fraud charges.\n\nMzembi is also facing separate charges of criminal abuse of office relating to a donation of television sets to three churches  the Prophetic Healing and Deliverance (PHD), United Family International (UFI) and the Zimbabwe Christian Church (ZCC).\n\nIt is his argument that he did this in line with a government policy of religious tourism. The televisions were bought by the ministry for the outside showing of the 2010 World Cup.\n\n",

            "content": "NewZimbabwe.com hasinvited Mr. Vengai Madzima, the Senior Partner at Madzima Chidyausiku Museta Legal Practitioners (MCM Legal), to discuss with us legal issues that affect Zimbabweans. The discussions are of a general nature, and those seeking specific legal advice should contact their lawyer.\n\nReporter: Welcome back Mr. Madzima. This week we want to discuss public-private partnerships in Zimbabwe, what they are and whether they are a goodconsiderationin theinvestment area.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nAs the name suggests, it is a partnership between the government on behalf of its people and a private player in the development of a particular project. Potential projects capable of investment vary and may range from projects like dam construction, road and rail infrastructure development, power generation and so forth. The opportunities are vast.\n\nThe motivation for the government is to provide its people with the necessary infrastructure at an affordable cost, including in projects where charges are defrayed directly to the public, for example, toll fees, while the motivation of the private sector is to maximise profits.\n\nThese motivations are the underlying guide to the contract negotiation process.\n\nSo in short, a typical Public Private Partnership will have the private company designing, funding, constructing and even implementing the project while the government monitors compliance with the undertakings made in the contract and in some instances allows for concessions within its capacity, like tax incentives to assist in expediting project implementation.\n\nReporter:Are PPPs in Zimbabwe a good area for investment in light of the potential economic risks?\n\nVM: The first thing to consider is that Zimbabwe is a developing country. That being said, it follows that there is a lot of scope where private players can partner up with the government to deliver necessary infrastructure at a profit.\n\nThe issue of risk, which is critical in all negotiations with all governments around the world, can be mitigated by understanding our economic model and laws. Our law makes it a condition precedent before entering any public-private partnership that the company or private party intending to enter into a Public-Private Partnership must undertake a thorough feasibility study of the project.\n\nThis feasibility study will highlight all the potential risks that may emanate from the project and such risks are then allocated to the best party capable of managing or mitigating them in the partnership contract.\n\nReporter: Where will a person contemplating a PPP go in the government to get assistance?\n\nVM: The Zimbabwe Investment and Development Agency (ZIDA) and specifically the Public Private Partnership Unit within the agency, is responsible for the examination and review of the project, including its risk allocation. For a project to proceed to implementation, it requires the approval of the PPP unit and the Minister of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion.\n\nIn unsolicited projects, where for instance, a private player has land that can be utilized in PPP to unlock value, the first port of call will obviously be the local council or responsible ministry with a comprehensive proposal outlining its value to the state and corresponding implementation requirements, be it legal, financial or technical.\n\nShould the government body responsible be satisfied with the proposal, it will then refer it to the PPP unit for evaluation. If the PPP unit gives the go-ahead, then the government body can enter negotiations with the private party for a mutually beneficial operating contract.\n\nReporter: What are the main considerations when negotiating a PPP?\n\nVM: It is critical to understand that PPPs are not a one-size-fits-all. Each PPP will address unique issues in a manner appropriate for that particular transaction. The underlying motivation for the parties remaining, as I stated earlier, the government intends to provide infrastructure at the best cost, and the private player intends to maximise as much profit. It is always best to allocate a portion of the profit as a buffer against unforeseen events like an increase in costs, delays in the project, which also have cost consequences, technical defects etc.\n\nAnother key consideration will be the model of the PPP, whether a Build Transfer PPP, a Build Operate and Transfer, Build Lease and Transfer. The type of structure should be one most suited to address projects particular risks.\n\nThe private partner on the other hand, may also be interested in achieving as many fiscal benefits as possible, which may include duty exemptions on capital goods, investment allowances, tax breaks or special rates et cetera.\n\nSpecial attention should also be afforded to the general contract clauses, like your dispute resolution clauses. They should allow provision for negotiated settlements as a first step in this type of contract, then consider alternative methods when negotiation fails. Other key clauses are your step-in, force majeure, and termination clauses as read with the undertakings clauses.\n\nReporter: Thank you, Mr. Madzima, we have run out of time.\n\nVM: Thank you.\n\nRELATED:\n\nYou can contact Vengai Madzima onvengai@mcmlegal.co.zwor at www.mcmlegal.co.zw\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHABANI Mpofu, a top lawyer and confidante of opposition leader Nelson Chamisa, has reacted angrily to a former military commanders declaration from the pulpit that Zanu PF will rule Zimbabwe forever.\n\nThe remarks, made by Anselem Nhamo Sanyatwe, the former Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) commander and current Minister of Sports, Recreation, Arts and Culture, have ignited a firestorm, with Mpofu calling for a decisive response.\n\nSanyatwe sparked the outrage while addressing congregants at a Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) church in Nyanga North over the weekend.\n\nHe was accompanying his wife, Chido, the local MP, who was receiving a donation of groceries from Kudakwashe Tagwireis Bridging Gaps Foundation.\n\nSanyatwe took the opportunity to assert that Zanu PF will remain in power till the donkeys grow horns, regardless of the electorates wishes.\n\nSanyatwes pronouncements have been met with dismay by many who view them as a blatant disregard for democratic principles and a chilling reminder of the struggle for constitutionalism in Zimbabwe.\n\nHopes for a change of government through the ballot box appear to have been directly undermined by the former military chiefs words.\n\nIt is worth noting that Sanyatwes career trajectory has been subject to intense scrutiny. After serving as ZNA commander for 16 months, President Emmerson Mnangagwa reassigned him to the sports ministry, a move widely interpreted by political analysts as a strategy to shore up his own position amid internal succession battles within Zanu PF.\n\nSanyatwe, once on the U.S sanctions list, is believed to be a close ally of Vice President Rtd General Constantino Chiwenga, himself tipped as a potential successor to Mnangagwa in 2028.\n\nAddressing the SDA congregation, with controversial tycoon Tagwirei also present, Sanyatwe declared the ruling party will retain power forever.\n\nZanu PF ichatonga kusvika madhongi amera nyanga. Ndazvitaura izvozvo nokuti handisisiri muoto. Pane vakambohukura hukura tazvitaura zvekare, ndiri kuzvidzokorora pamberi pekereke kuti uchida usingade tichakutonga kusvika madhongi amera nyanga.\n\nTranslated, this means: Zanu PF will rule till the donkeys grow horns. Im saying this because Im no longer a soldier. We had some people who thought this is a joke when we said it. Now, Im repeating it before the church that whether you like it or not, we will rule over you till the donkeys grow horns.\n\nIn response to the ex-army boss remarks, Mpofu vowed the comments cannot go unchallenged. He questioned the appropriateness of Sanyatwes using a church service to make such a partisan declaration.\n\nSanyatwe goes to my church and in my absence accuses me of kuvukura. Now thats political talk and its totally excusable. Whats not excusable is him saying this on the pulpit, on the sabbath (the holy day of the Lord) and in the presence of my church leaders.\n\nHow does a Zanu PF politician declare during a church service that his party will rule Zimbabwe forever? Mpofu wrote on his X account on Sunday.\n\nThe SDA church has been fully politicised and a line has now been crossed. We must respond decisively to this nonsense.\n\nFormer Binga North MP Prince Dubeko Sibanda echoed this sentiment, stating that Sanyatwe had defiled the church and compromised its neutrality.\n\nSanyatwe is no stranger to controversy. In 2018, he denied military involvement in the fatal shooting of six civilians during post-election protests in Harare. However, the Commission of Inquiry led by former South African President Kgalema Motlanthe established that soldiers were indeed responsible for the deaths of six civilians.\n\nThe army was subsequently sued for its role in the incident. At the time of the shootings, Sanyatwe was the Commander of the Presidential Guard. He was also placed on the U.S sanctions list.\n\nThis latest incident follows a pattern of serving and retired senior military figures openly declaring their allegiance to Zanu PF, and vowing never to salute anyone without liberation war credentials as President of Zimbabwe, further fuelling concerns about the impartiality of the security forces.\n\nIn 2002, months before Zimbabweans headed to the polls for a crucial presidential election, military chiefs delivered a stark warning, drawing a firm line on the qualities they expect in the countrys next leader. The top military brass declared that the presidency is not a prize to be won lightly, but rather a straitjacket whose occupant was expected to observe the objectives of the liberation struggle.\n\nThe message was delivered jointly by the then Defence Forces Chief Vitalis Zvinavashe (now late), Army Commander Constantine Chiwenga (now Vice President), Air Force Chief Perrence Shiri (now late) and Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri (now retired and in self-exile), has been widely interpreted as a not-so-subtle intervention in the electoral process.\n\nThis was at a time there was heightened political tension between the former and President Robert Mugabe, who faced formidable challenge from the late opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai.\n\nCritics have pointed out that the statement effectively sets a pre-condition for the presidency, one rooted in the historical narrative of the liberation war, thereby potentially disenfranchising voters who may hold differing views or priorities.\n\nThe opposition has condemned the generals remarks as a blatant attempt to intimidate voters and undermine the democratic process.\n\nThe controversy also underscores the enduring influence of the military in Zimbabwean politics.\n\nSenior figures within the ruling Zanu PF party, including current President Emmerson Mnangagwa and party spokesman Christopher Mutsvangwa, have often spoken of an unbreakable bond between Zanu PF and the military. Such pronouncements have led to accusations that elections are a mere ritual, with outcomes preordained due to the militarys allegiance to the ruling party.\n\nSection 208 of the Constitution explicitly forbids members of the security services, regardless of rank, from engaging in active politics.\n\nSanyatwes statement, therefore, raises serious questions about adherence to constitutional principles and the separation of powers in Zimbabwe.\n\n",

The decision follows fierce backlash from Zimbabwean activists, who accuse Mnangagwa of hypocrisy and have pledged to disrupt the event with protests.\n\nThe First Ladies of African Impact & Resilience (FLAIR) Summit, due to take place on 17-18 June at the Leonardo Royal Hotelin London, aims to spotlight female leadership and investment in Africa. But Mnangagwas inclusion has ignited controversy, prompting Butlers exit and raising questions about the participation of two other British politicians, Labour MP Diane Abbott and Conservative peer Baroness Sandip Verma.\n\nLabour MP Dawn Butler\n\nIn a statement, Butlers office said: We have never agreed to speaking at this event, so are rightly concerned that Dawn is being advertised as a speaker at this summit. We have contacted the organisers and asked them to remove her name from their programme immediately. The move came after Zimbabwean diaspora activists delivered a petition to 10 Downing Street, calling for Mnangagwa to be barred from the UK.\n\nA Controversial Guest\n\nAuxilliaMnangagwa, married to Zimbabwes President Emmerson Mnangagwa, was sanctioned by the US in 2023 under the Global Magnitsky Act. An Al Jazeera investigation,Gold Mafia, alleged she played a key role in smuggling gold and diamonds, funnelling profits to the ruling elite while Zimbabwes economy crumbled. Over 80% of Zimbabweans are unemployed, and 5.6 million face food insecurity, according to the World Food Programme. Last years elections, widely criticised as fraudulent by the EU, SADCand others, further entrenched the regimes grip on power.\n\nDespite this, Mnangagwa has cast herself as an advocate for womens empowermenta claim activists dismiss as a sham. On 4 June, campaigner JosephineJenje-Mudimbuled a protest outside Downing Street, delivering a petition to block Mnangagwas entry. In a video on X, she said: Charity begins at home.Auxilliashould clean up the mess she and her husband are creating in Zimbabwe. There is no room forAuxilliato come to the UK to present herself at FLAIR.\n\nIve got a message for Auxillia Mnangagwa, the illegitimate First Lady.\n\nThese were the first few words by Josephine Jenje-Mudimbu as she started. She was standing in front of 10 Downing Street in London, on the 4th of June 2025 as part of a protest that was also handing in apic.twitter.com/SbPCPvghXA\n\n Zimbabwe Freedom of Expression (@ZimbabweFreedo1)June 12, 2025\n\nThe outrage has spilled onto social media. X user @MilMillazwrote: AuxilliaMnangagwa must not be given a platform at the #FLAIRSummit. She represents a brutal regime responsible for abductions, mass corruption, and human rights abuses.\n\nPolitical Fallout\n\nButlers withdrawal has turned the spotlight on Abbott and Verma, both still listed as speakers. Abbott, a veteran Labour MP, and Verma, the UKs Ministerial Champion for Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls Overseas, have yet to clarify their stances. For Verma, the stakes are high: her role puts her at odds with sharing a stage with the spouse of a leader linked to state violence. Neither responded to inquiriesemailed to their offices last week.\n\nThe silence has fuelled criticism. Would these MPs sit with the spouse of a Russian oligarch? asked @ChirevoChamisaon X. If not, what makes Zimbabwe different? Activists argue that hosting Mnangagwa undermines the summits stated mission and sends a dangerous signal to Zimbabwean women enduring repression.\n\nThe FLAIR Summits organisers have remained tight-lipped, though sources suggest Mnangagwas participation could be reconsidered as protests mount. With just days until the event, the row exposes a broader dilemma: how to balance diplomatic engagement with accountability for human rights abuses.\n\nAs activists prepare to shut it down, the summits future hangs in the balance.\n\n",

Most of the victims belonged to the minority Ndebele tribe.\n\nMugabe, who died in 2019, never acknowledged responsibility for the massacres, dismissing evidence gathered by Amnesty International as a heap of lies.\n\nAfter taking power in 2017, Mnangagwa promised a resolution and set up a panel of chiefs to probe the massacres.\n\nFlawed process\n\nBut activists said the process was flawed as there had been no official government apology and victims were not consulted.\n\nActivist Mbuso Fuzwayo on Sunday dismissed the initiative as a sham from the start.\n\nThis is being dealt with from the position of the perpetrator and not the victims, he told AFP.\n\nSome of the known perpetrators are people in positions of power and they are the ones who led the initiative from the start, Fuzwayo said.\n\nMnangagwa, who has previously described the massacres as a bad patch in Zimbabwes history, was security minister at the time but has always denied any responsibility.\n\n",

            "content": "By Humeyra Pamuk I Reuters\n\nU.S. President Donald Trumps administration is considering significantly expanding its travel restrictions by potentially banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable seen by Reuters.\n\nEarlier this month, the Republican president signed a proclamation that banned the entry of citizens from 12 countries, saying the move was needed to protect the United States against foreign terrorists and other national security threats.The directive was part of an immigration crackdown Trump launched this year at the start of his second term, which has included the deportation to El Salvador of hundreds of Venezuelans suspected of being gang members, as well as efforts to deny enrollments of some foreign students from U.S. universities and deport others.In an internal diplomatic cable signed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the State Department outlined a dozen concerns about the countries in question and sought corrective action.The Department has identified 36 countries of concern that might be recommended for full or partial suspension of entry if they do not meet established benchmarks and requirements within 60 days, the cable sent out over the weekend said.The cable was first reported by the Washington Post.Among the concerns the State Department raised was the lack of a competent or cooperative government by some of the countries mentioned to produce reliable identity documents, the cable said.Another was questionable security of that countrys passport.Some countries, the cable said, were not cooperative in facilitating the removal of its nationals from the United States who were ordered to be removed. Some countries were overstaying the U.S. visas their citizens were being granted.Other reasons for concern were the nationals of the country were involved in acts of terrorism in the United States, or antisemitic and anti-American activity.The cable noted that not all of these concerns pertained to every country listed.We are constantly reevaluating policies to ensure the safety of Americans and that foreign nationals follow our laws, a senior State Department official said, declining to comment on specific internal deliberations and communications.The Department of State is committed to protecting our nation and its citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process, the official said.The countries that could face a full or a partial ban if they do not address these concerns within the next 60 days are: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cote DIvoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, Ethiopia, Egypt, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Tonga, Tuvalu, Uganda, Vanuatu, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.That would be a significant expansion of the ban that came into effect earlier this month. The countries affected were Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.The entry of people from seven other countries  Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela  has also been partially restricted.During his first in office, Trump announced a ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations, a policy that went through several iterations before it was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk Editing by Bill Berkrot.\n\nEarlier this month, the Republican president signed a proclamation that banned the entry of citizens from 12 countries, saying the move was needed to protect the United States against foreign terrorists and other national security threats.\n\nThe directive was part of an immigration crackdown Trump launched this year at the start of his second term, which has included the deportation to El Salvador of hundreds of Venezuelans suspected of being gang members, as well as efforts to deny enrollments of some foreign students from U.S. universities and deport others.In an internal diplomatic cable signed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the State Department outlined a dozen concerns about the countries in question and sought corrective action.The Department has identified 36 countries of concern that might be recommended for full or partial suspension of entry if they do not meet established benchmarks and requirements within 60 days, the cable sent out over the weekend said.The cable was first reported by the Washington Post.Among the concerns the State Department raised was the lack of a competent or cooperative government by some of the countries mentioned to produce reliable identity documents, the cable said.Another was questionable security of that countrys passport.Some countries, the cable said, were not cooperative in facilitating the removal of its nationals from the United States who were ordered to be removed.

            "content": "ExpressUK\n\nAfricasmost underrated country is home to amazing experiences featuring beautiful scenery and majestic wildlife. One YouTuber, who makes travel videos based on the wide range of destinations he has visited across the globe, featured Zimbabwe in a recent video and explained exactly why it is Africas most underrated spot. In fact, he went as far as to call it the most underrated country in the world. Tayo Aina showed off what the country has to offer visitors, from thewildlife experiencesto theiconic Victoria Falls.\n\nZimbabwe is located in southern Africa and is landlocked by Zambia, Mozambique,South Africaand Botswana. Home to just over 16 million people, it is a place that is often overlooked by tourists who are looking for the best experiences thatAfricahas to offer. However, that is a mistake according to many, such as this vlogger who calls it one of the most beautiful countries on the planet. Among the things he shows offin the videois Victoria Falls and a fascinating elephant and cheetah experience in which he gets up and close to these animals.\n\nAmong the famous sites in Zimbabwe is the aforementioned Victoria Falls, which is located on the border with Zambia. The Zambezi River plummets over a cliff here and it makes for a magnificent site that rivals that ofNiagra Fallsin the US.\n\nIt is ranked as the number one thing to do in Zimbabwe among Tripadvisor users, receiving rave reviews. One person said: It is one of the most beautiful places in the region, as it is imposing and huge. It is important to carry a raincoat, as we went in May, when the volume of water is high, creating large wet clouds.\n\nAnother wrote: Must see natural wonder of the world. It is impossible to describe how large and massive of a water sheet the falls are. Bring rain poncho!\n\nThe second-highest rated attraction in Zimbabwe is Prinlin Safari Travels, which offers excursions around this region of the country to take in the iconic Victoria Falls and the surrounding area.\n\nThere is also the Wild is Life animal sanctuary, which is home to fascinating creatures such aselephantsand other native wildlife. It is located in the capital city, Harare, which also has plenty of excitement and things to do.\n\nAnother well-reviewed attraction is Hwange National Park, where you can go on a fascinating safari trip to see some of Africas most exciting wildlife and scenery. For wildlife lovers, there is also Matobo National Park, Imire Rhino & Wildlife Conservation and Mukuvisi Woodlands.\n\nRedditusers have provided overwhelmingly positive reviews when it comes to visiting Zimbabwe. One person said: It is absolutely beautiful, and the people are amazing, generally very respectful and friendly.\n\nAnother shared: I was there a few months ago and thoroughly enjoyed it. Itinerary-wise, I hit up Vic Falls, Bulawayo with a day trip to Matobo National Park, Masvingo & the Great Zimbabwe Ruins, Harare and daytrips to the surrounding areas, Mutare & hiking in the Bvumba Mountains, and then a few days of hiking in Chimanimani to finish off. This took me about 3 weeks to do.\n\nThere are a number of airports you can fly into to get to Zimbabwe, depending on where you want to go in the country.\n\nYou can fly to Harare (Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport), Bulawayo (Joshua Mqabuko Nkomo International Airport) and Victoria Falls (Victoria Falls International Airport), changing at airportsalong the way.\n\nIt is clear that many people using the likes of YouTube,TikTokandRedditsee Zimbabwe as one of the most underrated countries in Africa, so it is somewhere that you can discover where none of your friends and family will have likely ever been.\n\n",

The Zimbabwe sprinting duo took the top two spots on the podium.\n\nTrailing the Zimbabweans was Garrett Kaalund of USC, who broke the 20-second barrier for the first time to claim third in 19.96 seconds.\n\nJust missing the podium was a name that may sound familiar to Big Blue Nation: Jordan Anthony.The former Kentucky wide receiver and sprinter, now competing for Arkansas, finished fourth in 20.01 seconds.\n\nThe dual-sport athlete has continued both his football and track careers with the Razorbacks since transferring in 2022.\n\nTMars McCallum, the early-season world leader from Tennessee, finished fifth in 20.16 seconds.\n\nUSCs Max Thomas followed in sixth with 20.23, Xavier Butler of Texas ran 20.39 to place seventh and Abdul-Rasheed Saminu of South Florida rounded out the heat in 20.55 seconds.\n\nAfter successfully sweeping the event in Nationals this year, he added 10 points to the team total.\n\nMakarawu helped Kentucky finish tied for eighth in the team standings with 22 total points.\n\nThe Harare native will now set his sights on the 2025 World Championships in Tokyo this September, where he will represent his native country alongside some of the NCAAs best to compete against the best athletes the sport has ever seen.\n\n",
