That contrasts with the ZSE  long a haven for investors during bouts of high inflation  which is slightly lower.\n\nThe VFEX has been the standout performer, with market capitalisation rising over 40% year to date, the Harare-based brokerage said in its latest equity report, attributing the strong performance to gold-linked and consumer-facing stocks.\n\nLiquidity on the VFEX has also improved significantly, the brokerage added. With average daily turnover up 197% from the prior year, reflecting deepening participation by both institutional and retail investors.\n\nThe main exchange in Harare has borne the brunt of a yearlong liquidity squeeze thats been in place since the 43% devaluation of the ZiG, short for Zimbabwe Gold, last September.\n\nTrading on the ZSE has slumped, and IH Securities expects the slowdown will continue to suppress stock market activity.\n\n",

However, it still has a long way to go before it becomes the sole legal tender for Zimbabwe, says Lyle Begbie, an economist at Oxford Economics Africa.\n\nZimbabwes history of hyperinflation and failed monetary experiments means itremainshighly dollarized. The U.S.dollar is the main medium of exchange, while the share ofZiGin monetary aggregates is small at around 17%. Prices are rarely quoted inZiG, and salaries and goods and services transactions are typically either fully or partially paid in U.S.dollars.\n\nWhile stabilizing inflation is undoubtedly positive, the landlocked nationwill need to remain steadfastregardingother challenges,before unlocking national sovereignty. Zimbabwes public debt, which reached $23.2 billion in 2024 (72.9% of GDP),per the World Bank,remainsa discouraging barrier to foreign investment.\n\nZimbabwes debt arrearssubstantially weighon its economic growth outlook, Begbie explains, before adding, Due to these arrears, the country cannot access concessional funding from multilateralorganizations, andis excluded from obtaining any sort of debt relief.\n\nThe World Bank has placed Zimbabwe in non-accrual status since 2000.

            "content": "IOL\n\nMembers of the ANCs national executive committee (NEC) have called for an investigation into how the South Africas intelligence services failed to warn the government about the imminent arrival of planes transporting refugees from Palestine.\n\nThe Mercury understands from NEC members, who were part of themeeting this past weekend, that concerns were raised that refugees had arrived in the country, with the intelligence services knowing nothing about it.\n\nTwo planes have landed in the country, withone landing a few days ago. The arrival of the passengers raised alarms within government circles, as it has since emerged that the refugees did not know where they were being taken.\n\nA source in the NEC said during discussions, members were shocked that the intelligence services failed to detect this situation.\n\nKeep in mind that this is not the first time something like this has happened; there is another plane that has arrived before, and there have been people coming from Palestine and, we understand, others from Ukraine. However, the intelligence service was unaware; how can that be? We now want them to be investigated, stated the source.\n\nThe NEC members said that both the domestic and foreign intelligence arms should take responsibility for this security breach.\n\nA plane filled with people just landed in our country and they know nothing about it. We wanted answers because this means this could happen again and again.\n\nThe source said the issue was not about the Palestinian refugees but the fact that such a security breach was allowed to happen. The party also wants a profile of everyone that is in the country.\n\nWe are concerned that some of the people that have arrived stated that they paid about R30 000 to be taken here, and we wanted to confirm if that is indeed the case.\n\nThe NEC member also said the party would want to put more stringent visa regimes in place going forward, pointing out that Palestinians and Israelis could get into the country with visas, and that could be beefed up going forward. We have to know who is in the country.\n\nSeveral attempts to get comment from the ANC yesterday were unsuccessful.\n\nPolitical analyst Thabani Khumalo said the situation has left many questions for the ruling party to answer.\n\nIn South Africa, you do not know whether this is a country or what; the manner in which this unfolded has left many people feeling unsafe. We do not feel safe, and the visitors to the G20 will feel unsafe as well.\n\nHow many people are roaming the streets that are unknown? There have been reports of people operating training camps, and even the defence members are complaining, indicating that many things are not going well.\n\nInternational Relations Minister Ronald Lamola said the flight was part of a clear agenda to cleanse Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank.\n\n[This] is a clearly orchestrated operation because they are not only being sent to South Africa. There are other countries where such flights have been sent, he said.\n\nIt was reported that the Palestinian embassy in South Africa stated that the group left Israels Ramon Airport and flew to the country via the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, without any prior notice or co-ordination.\n\nThe embassy added that an unregistered and misleading organisation had exploited the plight of the Gaza citizens, deceived families, collected money from them, and facilitated their travel in an irregular and irresponsible manner.\n\n",

The Fund derives income primarily through dividends and investment returns, and may selectively pursue third-party funding while maintaining conservative leverage under strict risk and governance frameworks.\n\nAddressing delegates at the Zimbabwe Gold Investment Conference 2025, MIF Deputy Chief Investment Officer Ernest Denhere said the strong performance was driven by investee companies within the mining cluster.\n\nThe Fund has strong presence in the gold space through Kuvimba Mining House (KMH) and Defold Mine, delivering 29% of Large Scale Miners gold to Fidelity between January and September, at 2.4 tons. The Fund recognises that gold currently presents a unique opportunity for value creation and growth in export receipts, he said.\n\nMIF officials noted that precious metals, especially gold, have surged in 2025 as investors seek safe-haven assets amid geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Gold has gained 56% year-to-date, while Zimbabwes gold exports have grown by 71% for the nine months to September 2025.\n\nDenhere said the value of gold exported by September stood at US$3.2 billion, with artisanal and small-scale miners contributing 74% of total gold output.\n\nWith a funding pipeline of at least US$500 million across several gold projects, the Fund is open to exploring different strategies to support the sector and bolster the gold value chain. MIF is a long-term, non-speculative investor focused on providing patient capital to its investors.\n\nThe Funds strategy also includes establishing an exploration fund. With gold as a safe-haven asset with long-term upside, there is strong upside for new discoveries, added Denhere.\n\n",

Under PSLs proposal, eight teams that were facing relegation this season would survive, while the four regional division champions would be promoted to the topflight, bringing the league to 22 clubs.\n\nThe meetingwas convened after ZIFA had earlier recommended a 20-team league structure.\n\nIn a statement, ZIFA, however, trashed the PSLs resolution,\n\nThe Association wishes to make it unequivocally clear that this proposal cannot be implemented. Promotion and relegation are fundamental components of football competition and are essential to maintaining the integrity, fairness, and sporting merit of the league system.\n\nZIFA confirmed that four clubs will be relegated at the conclusion of the 2025 Castle Lager Premier Soccer League season, which officially ends on 23 November 2025.\n\nThe association also reminded the PSL to follow proper procedure when proposing structural changes in the future.\n\nShould the Premier Soccer League or any other member wish to propose an adjustment to the number of participating teams or propose any other resolution, such a request must be formally submitted to the Association.
