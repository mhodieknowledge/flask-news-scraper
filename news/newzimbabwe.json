            "content": "BBC\n\nPresident Cyril Ramaphosa has called a group of 59 white South Africans who have moved to the US to resettle cowards, saying theyll be back soon.\n\nThe group of Afrikanersarrived in the US on Mondayafter President Donald Trump granted them refugee status, saying they faced racial discrimination.\n\nBut Ramaphosa said those who wanted to leave were not happy with efforts to address the inequities of the apartheid past, terming their relocation a sad moment for them.\n\nAs South Africans, we are resilient. We dont run away from our problems. We must stay here and solve our problems. When you run away you are a coward, and thats a real cowardly act, he added.\n\nTrump and his close ally, South Africa-born Elon Musk, have said there was a genocide of white farmers in South Africa a claim that has been widely discredited.\n\nThe US has also accused the South African government of seizing land from white farmers without paying compensation.\n\nMore than 30 years after the end of decades of rule by South Africas white minority, black farmers own only a small fraction of the countrys best farmland, with the majority still in white hands, leading to anger over the slow pace of change.\n\nIn January President Ramaphosa signed acontroversial law allowing the government to seize privately owned landwithout compensation in certain circumstances, when it is deemed equitable and in the public interest.\n\nBut the government says no land has yet been seized under the act.\n\nTrump has offered to resettle the white Afrikaners, descendants of mostly Dutch settlers, saying they were fleeing a terrible situation in South Africa.\n\nSpeaking on Monday at an agricultural exhibition in the Free State province, Ramaphosa said the Afrikaners were moving to the US because they were not favourably disposed to efforts aimed at addressing the countrys challenges.\n\nIf you look at all national groups in our country, black and white, theyve stayed in this country because its our country and we must not run away from our problems. We must stay here and solve our problems, Ramaphosa said.\n\nI can bet you that they will be back soon because there is no country like South Africa, he added.\n\nHis coward remark angered some social media users, who condemned it as an insult to aggrieved white South Africans.\n\nThe group of Afrikaners were welcomed by top US officials who claimed they had been living under a shadow of violence and terror in South Africa.\n\nWelcome to the land of the free, Deputy Secretary of State Chris Landau said as he received the South Africans who landed at Dulles airport near Washington DC on Monday.\n\nSome held young children and waved small American flags in the arrival area adorned with red, white and blue balloons on the walls.\n\nEarlier on Monday, President Ramaphosa told an Africa CEO forum in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, that he had recently told Trump during a phone call the US assessment of the situation was not true.\n\nWere the only country on the continent where the colonisers came to stay and we have never driven them out of our country, he added, dismissing claims Afrikaners were being persecuted.\n\nRamaphosa said dozens of white South Africans who arrived in the US on Monday dont fit the bill for refugees.\n\nAccording to theUS embassy in South Africa, to be considered eligible for the refugee resettlement scheme, someone must be:\n\nThe South African leader said he was due to meet his US counterpart soon regarding the issue.\n\nTrump has threatened to boycott the forthcoming G20 summit in South Africa unless the situation is taken care of.\n\n",

The only difference is that it is harder to steal as much as he wants from those other countries!\n\nWe await the details of the prices of the medical goods that will be procuredwe will find out soon! said Chinono in a social media post.\n\n",

The veterans contributed $50 each from their demobilisation pay-outs after independence and purchased 52 properties, which include farms, hotels and buildings.\n\nIn a bid to reclaim the property allegedly seized by Zanu PF bigwigs and their cronies during the height of the Gukurahundi atrocities in the 1980s, the ex-ZIPRA combatants, led by Moffat Commander Karomo, have set up camp at a site opposite Mzari Extension, near Machamire area, in Chinhoyi.\n\nThe group numbering nearly 50, comprises former liberation struggle veterans, widows and children of those who died before and after independence.\n\nThe protestors say they will stay put for as long as it takes for whoever forcibly grabbed the property, and many others dotted across the town and countrywide, to hand over the properties to them.\n\nIn an interview with NewZimbabwe.com in Chinhoyi this Wednesday, Karomo claimed their actions, as staged recently at Glen Forest where another of Nitram properties lies, had the blessings of Vice President Kembo Mohadi.\n\nWe are here with the blessings of VP Mohadi, and we are here to take back what was illegally taken away from ZIPRA combatants, widows and their children who are wallowing in abject poverty, said Karomo.\n\nHe claimed President Emmerson Mnangagwa had tasked the veterans to identify their properties across the country so he could facilitate their repossession.\n\nIn Chinhoyi, Karomo claims that besides owning the vast land on which Pearview medium-density suburb was sited, Nitram is the legitimate owner of Old Chinhoyi Hotel and Caves Hotel, currently under the management of the Zimbabwe Parks and Wildlife Authority (ZimParks).\n\nKaromo said it has taken far too long since Mnangagwa promised to facilitate the return of Nitram Holdings stolen properties.\n\nMnangagwa must show his sincerity now. Since he instructed us to identify our properties, we are doing exactly that, thats why we are here in Chinhoyi today on one of our properties. We are not here to fight anyone, but those who took what doesnt belong to them are the ones out to fight us.\n\nIts been 45 years of being taken for a ride. We are not politicking nor engaging in factional politics. We are all Zanu PF, but we want to hear from President Mnangagwa what he has to say, now that we have identified our properties, Karomo told NewZimbabwe.com.\n\nA widow of a former ZIPRA combatant, Cecilia Moyo, said her late husband had confided in her of the vast wealth ex-guerilla fighters had accumulated courtesy of investment in Nitram Holdings.\n\nShe demanded the legacy of her children and grandchildren, which Nitram Holdings amassed under the stewardship of late Vice President Joshua Nkomo.\n\nWe are suffering from hypertension and other chronic diseases because of this matter. We are being victimised on the small plots where we were settled, yet we have all this wealth. We are suffering while some crooked people are enjoying our childrens inheritance, said Moyo.\n\nIn respect of the Chinhoyi land where the group is camped, Moyo claimed an Indian descendant only identified as Khan, now late, who was linked to late VP Nkomo, had knowledge of its ownership as well as the inventory of other Nitram Holdings properties in Mashonaland West.\n\nMoyo says the late Khans son has to answer for his father on how he transferred the disputed land to its current purported owner.\n\nFarai Madzvanya, a representative of children of war veterans, appealed to Mnangagwa to facilitate the expeditious return of the properties, an inheritance bequeathed to them by their now deceased fathers, who themselves never benefited from it.\n\nGovernment, which seized Nitram Holdings properties following the alleged discovery of arms caches at some farms in Midlands and Bulawayo provinces, is accused of dragging its feet in proceedings to return the properties to ex-ZIPRA fighters, widows and their children.\n\nTheNitram Holdings board is on record accusing some unnamed influential government officials of scuttling efforts to repossess their properties.\n\n",
