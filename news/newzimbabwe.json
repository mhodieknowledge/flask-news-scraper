            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA Kadoma man accused of stabbing another miner to death in a suspected love triangle has been acquitted after the High Court ruled that police bungled investigations and relied on genuine but mistaken witnesses.\n\nJustice Philda Muzofa cleared Mashoko Midzi of murdering Stanly Mpofu, who was stabbed four times and died at Chimwendo Compound, Battlefields, on December 23, 2022.\n\nMidzi had been arrested in dramatic fashion, shot twice by police who claimed he attacked them with a machete. But in a damning judgment, the court said there was no proof he resisted arrest or carried the alleged weapon.\n\nThe evidence placed before us established police high-handedness when they arrested the accused, Justice Muzofa ruled. Of all the strange evidence placed before us, the following can take the prize Surely how can two police officers contradict each other on such a pertinent issue unless nothing of this sort happened?\n\nAccording to the State, Mpofu had clashed with Midzi earlier that day at a canteen where they argued over Beatrice Chinamasa, a young cook who had just started working there. Chinamasa later confirmed she was dating Mpofu, but said she never saw Midzi that day and did not know he was allegedly interested in her.\n\nWitness Agatha Sibanda, Mpofus aunt and the canteen owner, told the court she saw Midzi chasing her drunken nephew before he collapsed, bleeding heavily. But the judge found her evidence unreliable.\n\nHer evidence was that she saw his clothes. That is weak identification, said Justice Muzofa. Jeans and gumboots are common clothes in the mining communities for men. We conclude that Agatha was a genuine but mistaken witness.\n\nMidzi insisted from the start that he was innocent, saying he spent the night drinking beer at Fambai Bar with friends and relatives. He raised this alibi in his warned-and-cautioned statement just days after the killing.\n\nThe court criticised investigators for failing to properly test that defence. It was within the polices capacity to record statements from Moyo Mine, the accuseds companions or someone from Fambai Bar. They did not, the judge said. The alibi remained intact.\n\nAlthough the State had raised a strong suspicion that Midzi may have killed Mpofu, the judge stressed that suspicion was not enough.\n\nThe standard of proof in criminal cases is proof beyond a reasonable doubt, she ruled. In this case, the evidence raised many unanswered questions, leading to doubt. In such instances, the matter is resolved by giving the accused the benefit of doubt.\n\nMidzi was acquitted and walked free after more than two years of fighting the charge.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nCitizens Coalition for Change (CCC)legislators on Wednesday demanded the implementation of electoral reforms, including recommendations made in the 2023 SADC Observer Election Report, before Zimbabwe holds its next general elections.\n\nZimbabwe is scheduled to hold general elections in 2028 when President Emmerson Mnangagwas current constitutional mandate ends. However, Zanu PF has already resolved at its last Conference to push for extending his stay in office until 2030.\n\nDuring a parliamentary Question and Answer session, CCC Harare Central MP Lovemore Jimu pressed government to outline policy measures for implementing electoral reforms ahead of the next polls.\n\nResponding, Acting Leader of Government Business in Parliament Felix Mhona said the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) was solely responsible for administering election matters.\n\nI am very happy that we have one of our institutions, ZEC, which superintends over elections. Our Constitution outlines what must be done prior to an election. If there are any specific concerns, the Honourable Member is free to put them on the Order Paper for the relevant Minister to address, said Mhona.\n\nCCCs Ellen Shiriyedenga reminded the House that ZEC had submitted a 2023 election report with specific recommendations.\n\nWe are in the preparatory stage of the election cycle. This is the time to implement ZECs recommendations from the 2023 elections. What is ZEC currently doing to ensure this happens before 2028? she asked.\n\nMhona responded by urging her to specify which recommendations had not been addressed, adding that the SADC report had not discredited Zimbabwes elections.\n\nThey were deemed to be credible, fair and transparent. It is just like if you are in a vote scenario where you have the minority and the majority. You might raise your concerns under the minority but the obvious majority rules, Mhona said.\n\nWarren Park MP, Shakespeare Hamauswa, also asked about stakeholder dialogue in preventing disputed elections. Mhona stated that President Mnangagwas Political Actors Dialogue (POLAD) platform was still available if the opposition wants to join.\n\nWhen we say we have a listening President, he has invited all political players to engage with him. He has an open-door policy and is amenable to addressing concerns raised, he said.\n\nCCC Mbizo legislator Corban Madzivanyika insisted that the SADC report highlighted serious shortcomings, including issues around voter registration, high nomination fees, state media bias, and election materials.\n\nMinister Mhona maintained that the ruling partys electoral victory reflected the will of the people, urging the opposition to look ahead.\n\nThe fact that Zanu PF is in Parliament with a majority shows that elections were held. Let us now focus on the future and address anomalies as we prepare for the next election, he said.\n\nHowever, MP Ransome Makamure reminded the House that Zimbabwe had recently chaired SADC and could not ignore its own bodys report.\n\nWe must embrace the SADC report, not dismiss it, since we are part of the regional bloc, she said.\n\n",

These included building sufficient foreign currency reserves and slashing annual inflation from 94% to single digits.\n\nThe ZiG wasintroducedin April 2024, marking the southern African nations sixth effort to stand up a viable local currency after previous efforts failed amid sky-high inflation and collapsing values on foreign exchange markets.\n\nSigns of improving sentiment toward the ZiG include a slowdown in the rate at which it is exchanged for US dollars, said Matshe, citing banking data. Currently, the ZiG accounts for about 40% of transactions in the economy\n\n",

Finer details on the reasons behind the job cuts and terminal benefits to be paid remain unclear. What boggles the mind is that the workers have since been placed on paid leave while the organisation has moved swiftly to replace some of the targeted workers, one insider said on condition of anonymity.\n\nAnother source alleged that the retrenchments disproportionately affected staff who were members of trade unions.\n\nOver and above all these shortcomings, we need to understand why the company has hurriedly replaced the affected workers in some sections, while others have been replaced through outsourcing services like cleaning. Among those recruited recently are allegations that they were warned against being unionised as a condition of service, the source claimed.\n\nThe affected employees are now expecting a reasonable termination package as they argue that the employers decision has nothing to do with the inability to pay salaries.\n\nWhen contacted for comment, MIL general manager Sibusisiwe Ndlovu neither confirmed nor denied the allegations, instead referringNewZimbabwe.comto the internal communications department, which had not responded by the time of publication.\n\nHowever, a letter seen byNewZimbabwe.com,dated September 16, 2025, and signed by Ndlovu, confirmed the institutions decision to retrench some staff. The letter, addressed to one affected employee (name withheld), reads in part:\n\nWe wish to advise you that your position has been affected by the restructuring exercise, therefore, you are among members of staff who will be retrenched. The intended retrenchment will take effect from the fourteenth day after the date of receiving this letter.\n\nEngagements with you shall commence soon, and it is our hope that a retrenchment agreement will be reached to facilitate an expeditious conclusion of this in a manner which is fair and transparent.\n\n",

Now they dont have to look beyond Africa to get it, he said.\n\nMasiyiwa, who isworth about $1.3 billion, is known for building Econet Wireless into one of Africas largest telecom groups.\n\nIn recent years, he has expanded Cassava from telecoms into cloud computing, fintech, cybersecurity andartificial intelligence.\n\nThefirst AI factory is already under developmentin South Africa and will run on 3,000 Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs).\n\nCassava says much of this computing power has already been reserved by African researchers and developers.\n\nCompany officials said the new facilities will help close a major gap in Africas digital economy.\n\nOnly about 5% of African AI talent currently has access to the high-performance computing power needed to train advanced AI models.\n\nBuilding local infrastructure could allow more African researchers to develop homegrown tools in sectors like finance, education, health and agriculture.\n\nCassava also plans to link the AI factories to its wider digital network, which includes Africa Data Centres, Liquid Intelligent Technologies, and Liquid C2.\n\nThese companies already provide data storage, internet connectivity and cybersecurity services across the continent.\n\nEarlier this year, Cassava launched a dedicated AI business unit and signed partnerships with global tech firms including Microsoft, AWS, Google and Anthropic to support African developers.\n\nAnalysts say the push could helpAfrica compete in the fast-growing global AI industrywhile keeping sensitive data on the continent.\n\nIt could also reduce costs for local startups and governments, who often pay high fees to store and process data overseas.\n\nIf completed on schedule, all five factories are expected to be operational by late 2026, positioning Cassava as one of the biggest builders of AI infrastructure in Africa.\n\n",
