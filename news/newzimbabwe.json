The Warriors sit bottom of Group C with four points, nine behind leaders South Africa, who have 13.\n\nA victory against Benin would keep Zimbabwes hopes of progressing to the next round faintly alive, depending on the results of other teams.\n\nSpeaking about the challenge ahead, Nees said:\n\nThey will take this match very seriously. Benin is a very stubborn and disciplined team, and they usually dont concede. So its going to be a very tough encounter for us, but we have to grind out a positive result.\n\nThe Warriors will be without vice-captain Marshall Munetsi for the Benin clash. However, the Wolverhampton midfielder is expected to return to action on Tuesday when Zimbabwe faces Rwanda at Orlando Stadium in South Africa.\n\n",
