As a content provider of our flagship breakfast show, his alignment with comments made on the vodcast does not reflect who we are as a station, nor what our listeners expect of us.\n\nPhenduka was placed under suspension on August 20 pending the outcome of an internal process.\n\nTiltmann added that the incident was a further material breach of his Independent Contract, despite Sols written assurance to Kaya management in June 2023 that such conduct would not recur, while acknowledging his responsibilities as a representative of the station, apologising to the Kaya family and stakeholders, and committing to upholding the standards expected of him.\n\nTiltmann reiterated Kaya 959s values are not open to compromise.\n\nTrust, integrity, accountability, respect, and inclusivity are the foundations of Kaya 959. They guide everything we do on air, online and off air. We are answerable to our listeners, and when conduct falls short, we act decisively, Tiltmann said.\n\nTiltmann further explained that the decision followed a process aligned with Kaya 959s Independent Contractor Agreement, which allows for immediate termination in cases where the actions of an individual with a public profile bring the station into disrepute. Kaya 959 remains committed to maintaining a safe, respectful, and inclusive working environment, supported by rigorous broadcasting standards and a culture of accountability across all platforms.\n\n",

He reportedly discussed strengthening cooperation in trade, health, agriculture, mining, investment, technologyincluding milestones like ZIMSAT1and reaffirmed commitment to deepen ZimbabweJapan relations.\n\nOnly last week, the 82-year-old Zanu PF leader met with His Holiness Pope Leo XIV at the Vatican, where they reflected on the Catholic churchs vital role in Zimbabwes schools, hospitals, and social services, and shared views on peace and justice in todays world.\n\nBefore the jetleg could subside, Mnangagwa, whose initial days in office were toned around austerity to cut on spending on foreign travel, he was off to the East this Sunday.\n\nAccording to State media, Mnangagwa is expected to join fellow invited Heads of State and Government from 26 countries, including Russian President Vladimir Putin, at Tiananmen Square for a massive military parade among other activities hosted by China for the commemorations.\n\nThe Chinese Peoples War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-1945) was the first to break out and lasted the longest in the World Anti-Fascist War.\n\nAccording to reports, in 14 years, 35 million Chinese were killed or wounded. Japan officially surrendered on September 2, 1945 by signing the Instrument of Surrender.\n\nIn 2014, Chinas national legislature designated September 3 as Victory Day of its War of Resistance.\n\nA year later, the country held its first-ever large-scale parade at Tiananmen Square to mark the occasion.\n\nState media quoted Zimbabwes Ambassador to China, Abigail Shoniwa, saying President Mnangagwa, who left the Vatican last night, is one of a few African leaders invited to the event, signalling deep ties between Harare and Beijing.\n\nThe Presidents arrival is awaited and we are very excited, he is coming at the invitation of his counterpart, President Xi Jinping and he will be one of quite a number of Heads of State that are coming.\n\nPerhaps, I can take the opportunity to add that he is one of the very few African Heads of State coming, Shoniwa told State media.\n\nWhile in China, Mnangagwa is billed to hold bilateral talks with President Xi on deepening co-operation across various sectors.\n\nThe octogenarian leader will also dialogue with company executives with business interests in Zimbabwe.\n\nChina has supported Zimbabwes various local projects, including Hwange Units 7 and 8 expansion, Kariba South Hydro Power Extension, expansion of the Robert Gabriel Mugabe and Victoria Falls International Airports.\n\nChina is Zimbabwes largest source of investment with cumulative investments exceeding US$4,4 billion, including US$400 million in the past year alone. In 2024, bilateral trade surged to US$3,8 billion with 24 percent year-on-year growth.\n\nLast month, Mnangagwa presided over the signing ceremony of a US$55 million Economic and Technical Co-operation Agreement between Zimbabwe and China in Harare.\n\n",

The CZI identified nine areas requiring immediate intervention, including cutting the states debt to the private sector, adjusting a 30% foreign-currency retention threshold for exporters and reducing sugar taxes on beverage makers.\n\nIt also called for a currency policy revamp and for the central bank to formalise and legalise its proclamations on phasing out the use of the dollar, so as to strengthen business and investor confidence. Most transactions in the southern African nation are currently conducted with the greenback, and the authorities aim to end that practice and ensure the bullion-backed Zimbabwe Gold currency is used solely by 2030.\n\nZimbabwes Industry and Commerce Minister Mangaliso Ndlovu didnt immediately respond to a call to his mobile phone seeking comment. Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube last month said the authorities are working on tackling regulatory constraints faced by formal businesses that bear the brunt of taxes, while a burgeoning informal sector avoids paying.\n\nIn Argentina, Milei has been spearheading a campaign to make it easier to do businesses, promote investment and reduce the role of the state in the economy, including scrapping most price controls and abolishing a number of regulations.\n\n",
