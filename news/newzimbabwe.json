            "content": "IOL\n\nSOUTH AFRICA  A foreign national employee must be provided with proper notice of their termination in line with the Basic Conditions of Employment Act (BCA). Failure to provide such notice may result in the termination being unlawful.\n\nThis is the warning of employment law experts at Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr (CDH), following a recent Eastern Cape High Court judgment.\n\nThis was after an application by a research assistant and Zimbabwean national, Samuel Nyakudya.\n\nHe was granted a temporary residence permit allowing him to reside in South Africa and seek employment in the category of general work as provided for under the Immigration Act.\n\nHis employer, the OR Tambo District Municipality, however, terminated his employment contract due to allegations of its unlawfulness and irregularity.\n\nCommenting on the case, CDH said that this area of termination has just become a lot clearer for employers after the recent ruling, stating that employing a foreign national without a work visa does not automatically grant an employer the right to summarily terminate the employment contract.\n\nThis indicates a key warning for employers highlighting their responsibility to act lawfully and in accordance with the BCA, CDH said.\n\nThe experts explained that a foreign national employee must be provided with proper notice of their termination in line with the BCA. Failure to provide such notice may result in the termination being unlawful. The dismissal may also be found to be unfair in the CCMA (Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration).\n\nNyakudya was employed on successive fixed-term contracts, but following the expiration of his last contract, the municipality allowed him to continue working without a new fixed-term contract.\n\nThroughout his employment, Nyakudya was not consistently in possession of a work visa. In November 2023, the municipality notified him that his contract had expired on March 31, 2022, and that he had failed to provide a copy of his South African identity document, despite being requested to do so.\n\nConsequently, the municipality claimed it had no choice but to terminate his employment immediately, citing the unlawful nature of his contract due to the expiration of his work visa.\n\nWhile Nyakudya could have contested the fairness of his dismissal before the CCMA, he opted to challenge the termination in the High Court.\n\nThe court ultimately ruled that Nyakudyas employment contract termination was unlawful..\n\nCDH said the Immigration Act outlines an employers responsibilities regarding the employment of foreign nationals, specifically in Section 38, which prohibits the employment of illegal foreigners or those whose status does not authorise them to work.\n\nIt said the court also referenced Section 49(3) of the Immigration Act, which states that employing an illegal foreigner or a foreigner in violation of the Act constitutes a criminal offence.\n\nThe court confirmed that such employment is punishable by fines or imprisonment upon conviction.\n\nRegarding the summary termination of Nyakudyas contract, the court considered Section 37(1) of the BCEA, which stipulates the notice period required for termination based on the duration of employment.\n\nThe court highlighted that the purpose of providing notice is to allow employees to prepare for a smooth transition.\n\nNyakudyas lack of a work visa or South African identity document was a critical factor in the case. The court determined that employing a foreign national without a work visa is prohibited, and thus, the municipalitys immediate termination of Nyakudyas contract was unlawful.\n\nThis case serves as a significant reminder that employing a foreign national without a work visa does not automatically grant an employer the right to terminate the employment contract summarily, CDH warned.\n\n",

Sorry for the outage.SpaceXwill remedy root cause to ensure it doesnt happen again, the SpaceX CEO wrote on X.\n\nThe outage was a rare hiccup for SpaceXs most commercially sensitive business that had experts speculating whether the service, known for its resilience and rapid growth, had been beset by a glitch, a botched software update or even a cyber-attack.\n\nDoug Madory, an expert at the internet analysis firm Kentik, said the outage was global and that such a sweeping interruption was unusual.\n\nThis is likely the longest outage ever for Starlink, at least while it became a major service provider, Madory said.\n\nAs Starlink has gained more users, SpaceX has focused heavily in recent months on updating its network to accommodate demands for higher speed and bandwidth.\n\nThe company, in a partnership with T-Mobile, is also expanding the constellation with larger, more powerful satellites to offer direct-to-cell text-messaging services, a line of business in which mobile phone users can send emergency text messages through the network in rural areas.\n\nSpaceX has launched more than 8,000 Starlink satellites since 2020, building a uniquely distributed network in low Earth orbit that has attracted intense demand from militaries, transportation industries and consumers in rural areas with poor access to traditional, fiber-based internet.\n\nId speculate this is a bad software update, not entirely dissimilar to the CrowdStrike mess with Windows last year, or a cyber-attack, said Gregory Falco, director of a space and cybersecurity laboratory at Cornell University.\n\nAn update to CrowdStrikes widely used cybersecurity software led to worldwide flight cancellations and affected industries around the globe in July last year. The outage disrupted internet services, affecting 8.5 million Microsoft Windows devices.\n\nIt was unclear whether Thursdays outage affected SpaceXs other satellite-based services that rely on the Starlink network. Starshield, the companys military satellite business unit, has billions of dollars worth of contracts with the Pentagon and US intelligence agencies.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nJournalist Edmund Kudzayi has formally requested the High Court to rescind a default judgment that awarded US$100,000 in damages to top lawyer Fadzayi Mahere in a defamation case.\n\nThe case stemmed from allegations by the Kukurigo owner that Mahere was dating a married businessman, Tinashe Murapata which had caused the collapse of his marriage.\n\nKudzayi argues that the judgment was issued without proper legal procedure, and he claims a bona fide defense against the allegations made by Mahere.\n\nKudzayi, through his legal representatives at Gunje Legal Practice in Harare, stated that he was neither in wilful default nor was he given adequate opportunity to present his defense.\n\nThe default judgment, which was granted on July 10, 2025, arose from a civil claim filed by Mahere in case number HC3060/22.\n\nThe crux of Kudzayis argument rests on a series of procedural irregularities.\n\nHe said the case had previously been struck off the court roll due to Maheres failure to prosecute, alleging further that her claims regarding the status of the case were misrepresented to the court.\n\nAt all material times, I have been participating in the matter, filing all papers on time, demonstrating my desire to have my defense ventilated and vindicated in open court, Kudzayi stated.\n\nKudzayi also contends that he was obstructed from attending a crucial hearing due to security restrictions at the High Court, an incident he claims was acknowledged by both Mahere and her legal representatives.\n\nIt is his argument that this obstruction led to his defense being struck off without his knowledge or the proper legal foundation.\n\nMy defence was struck out and the matter placed on the unopposed my knowledge, apparently without a formal application (I certainly one on the consolidated record) after a hearing on 24 March 2025 before Hon Justice Wamambo, a hearing I was obstructed from attending by High Court security even though I was in the High Court building.\n\nThe fact that I was obstructed from attending the hearing by security at the High Court is known to the Court and the Defendant and her legal practitioners who, as officers of the Court, would have known that I was not in wilful default and should not have chosen to snatch at a judgment but sought to have the matter heard on the merits.\n\nEven if the judgment is rescinded and the matter is set back to where it was, I have reasonable grounds for success in the main action, he said.\n\nIn his application, Kudzayi also said that Maheres claims are not only unfounded but also benefit from an exaggerated damages award.\n\nHe draws attention to previous defamation judgments in Zimbabwe, noting that the US$100,000 award is unprecedented and significantly higher than any earlier awards, including Maheres own cases, where damages did not exceed US$18,000.\n\nHe said, Fraud vitiates everything, highlighting what he describes as misleading representations made by Mahere during the reinstatement process.\n\nEven if I am found to have been in wilful default or go on to lose the main action, this judgment must still be rescinded on the basis that it was erroneously granted as no court in Zimbabwe would award the quantum of damages awarded to the respondent as it is so extraordinary as to constitute a manifest injustice, he said.\n\nThe defamation claim itself revolves around Kudzayis allegations of Maheres extramarital affair, which he argues serves the public interest.\n\nHis legal team insists that Mahere cannot substantiate her claims without proper cross-examination and that the judgments value is disproportionate to the alleged damages.\n\nKudzayis application for rescission also focuses on the implications of allowing the judgment to stand.\n\nHe argues that the case has spiralled into a deliberate and calculated deception, undermining the integrity of the judicial process.\n\nThe matter is yet to be heard.\n\n",
