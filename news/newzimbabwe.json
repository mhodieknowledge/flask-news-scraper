            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe City of Harare has said it is keen to interview controversial socialite Malloti following a viral video in which she broke a clamp affixed on her Nissan Note along Kwame Nkrumah Avenue in the Central Business District (CBD).\n\nIn the viral video, Malloti born Namatai Bhobho is seen moving her car back and forth in an attempt to dislodge the clamp, ultimately succeeding but causing damage to the cars front bumper.\n\nAs she was driving away, a man in civilian clothes is seen picking up the broken clamp and aiming it at Mallotis cars windscreen, breaking it.\n\nAfter the incident, Malloti took to her Instagram saying, These people clamped me at 4 PM, where should I have gone at that time to pay for the fine?\n\nI am loaded with badness in my real life, its better to get a screen for $70 than to give these people even a dollar. Its not about money, I just refused to be weighed down and wasting my time. First thing tomorrow morning is replacing the screen; as long as these people havent eaten my money, its a win for me.\n\nHowever, in a statement, the City of Harare said the man who damaged her windscreen is not an employee adding that they were keen to interview the owner of the car as breaking a clamp affixed on a car is an offence.\n\nWe have taken note of the video of a blue motor vehicle Registration number AGG7256 which had been clamped by our parking marshals in the Central Business District.\n\nThe vehicle is seen being driven back and forth and in the process breaking the clamp. The video further shows a man in civilian attire throwing a piece of the broken clamp on the windscreen of the speeding car. The City wishes to put the following on record:\n\nThe man who is seen throwing the metal object at the car is not a member or an employee of the City of Harare.\n\nThe breaking of a clamp affixed on a motor vehicle by an authorised officer is an offence.\n\nConsequently Harare Traffic Enforcement Unit is keen to interview the owner of the motor vehicle registration number AGG 7256 in connection with the breaking of a clamp, the notice reads.\n\nMembers of the public are encouraged to comply with the Harare (Clamping and Tow) bylaw 2005 which states that the release of clamped vehicles is upon payment of prescribed fines.\n\nMalloti made headlines earlier this year following revelations that she has been on the South African Police Services (SAPS) wanted list since 2017.\n\nAccording to SAPS records, a warrant of arrest for one Namatai Bhobhowho is facing charges of armed robberywas issued on January 19, 2018, at the Wynberg Magistrate Court in South Africa.\n\n",

            "content": "By Delaney Phiri I University of London\n\nThe recent move by Zimbabwe police to take Mr Blessed Mhlanga, a well-known journalist, into custody without following due process is and ought to be understood for what it is. That move, at the very least, can be said to be an unlawful arrest and, at the very worst, it is and should be understood as a State-facilitated abduction!\n\nBy definition, abduction is the act of taking someone away by force or deception; which is precisely the case here. The said Mr Mhlanga was taken by force, under the guise of bogus charges which do not hold even an ounce water (deception). In circumstances where a journalist conducts an interview with a person of interest, the journalist cannot be held responsible for the views of the interviewee.\n\nSecondly, and more interestingly, the said Mr Mhlanga is not an independent journalist; he is not the owner of the said media house. He is merely an agent of the company, who was acting in the course of his employment. As such, it does not follow that he can personally be liable for the alleged wrongful conduct on behalf of the media house he is employed by. The principle of vicarious liability immediately kicks in under these circumstances.\n\nBlessed Mhlanga at the Harare courts on Tuesday\n\nIn furtherance of the above, there are directors, persons who signed off on the production and broadcasting of the said interview and, against that back drop, a question has to be asked  are they also being prosecuted? If the answer to that question is not in the affirmative then, surely, the charges cannot be said to be genuine and or a bona fide investigation leading to a just outcome; they are simply bogus.\n\nAnother point or consideration; an arrest on the basis that the interviewee shared some opinions which may have been a breach of certain acts in the criminal codification brings to surface the fact that the rule of law isnt necessarily adhered to in the said jurisdiction. It is a well-known and established principle of law that everyone is entitled to the presumption of innocence. And, if we are to be true to this principle, it does not follow that a journalist can be arrested on suspicion that the interviewee shared opinions that may be argued to have been incitement of violence and or undermining the office of the President.\n\nThe States averement would be that the journalist amplified remarks by the interviewee and, in so doing, can be said to have aided and abetted the accused. However, before the interviewer is even considered for liability, there needs to be a determination on the question of whether or not the remarks made by his guest were in, and of themselves, criminal in nature.\n\nA decision has to be made by a competent court of law. In circumstances where that determination has NOT been made, any proceedings against the journalist are, at the very least, premature and lack any basis at law and hence the assertion that this is a State-facilitated abduction!\n\nThe fact that an abduction has been made by State agents using State resources and hiding behind the law does not, in fact, change what this is; it is still an abduction. It remains an abduction and should be addressed and understood as such. To call this an arrest sanitises and legitimises the said abduction. There is no basis at law for this so-called arrest. Journalism is not a crime, an unlawful arrest as a means to intimidate the journalist is accurately called an abduction.\n\nIn opposing bail, or in refusing to do the right thing, the State incompetently argued that Mr Mhlanga could not be released on bail on the basis that, inter alia, the equipment used has not been ceased. Therefore, the likelihood of him committing similar offences is high. What the State immured in its arguments is the fact that, the said equipment does not belong to the journalist but is the property of the company he works for.\n\nThis argument exposes the fact that, the aim of opposing bail is not a bona fide objection in the interest of justice but rather selective persecution of the journalist. Firstly, if the equipment is out there and the concern is he may have access to it, why not order the company to restrict him from access to the said equipment?\n\nSecondly, the argument that he may interfere with potential witnesses who are his junior colleagues further proves he acted in the course of his employment and the absence of any claims by his employer that he acted outside the ambit of his employment further solidifies the fact that he acted in the course of his employment and if there is any case to answer then the company is answerable.\n\nThis misplaced and overzealous persecution of a journalist is one example of malicious prosecution to instil fear into all journalists. Release Blessed Mhlanga! We condemn State-facilitated abductions!!\n\nSound of Justice!! Delaney Phiri lecturer at the University of London.\n\n",

The song delves into his personal battles and the demons of poverty.\n\nThe new release, a blend of three great musical voices, celebrates the hardships of ZvirimoMumoyothose whose dreams are manifesting, albeit at a slow pace.\n\nThe songs visuals depict a young man in the high-density suburbs who, despite the hardships, is driven by ambition.\n\nThe protagonist is a reflection of Master H himself, who endured hurdles such as drug abuse and a lack of opportunity before making his breakthrough in the music scene.\n\nThe song resonates with the majority of young people who navigate a life born out of hardship and struggle. The ghetto setting paves the way for Ghetto Tears.\n\nGhetto Tears portrays hardship once again, with strife at the core of its message. It offers a raw and introspective perspective on the lives of young people.\n\nMaster H, himself a product of the ghetto, has taken it upon himself to be the voice of striving young people. He interrogatespoverty that is rife in the ghetto which has seen many failing to acquire basics.\n\nThe intertwining themes of the three songs, each carrying a deeper meaning, are a testament to Master Hs lyrical prowess.\n\nAnchored in hardship, the three tracks carry a message of hope despite the struggles.\n\nOverall, the EP showcases Master Hs versatility as an artist, blending his signature party anthems with deeper, more reflective narratives.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTRADE Promotion agency, ZimTrade has implored local players to pursue strategic partnershipsandtap into the US$144billion agrochemicals global industry potential.\n\nAccording to the agency, the SADC market alone imported US$4,4 billion worth of agrochemicals in 2023, up from US$2,7 billion in 2019.\n\nCOMESA imports showed similar growth, climbing to US$4,9 billion in 2023 from US$3,1 billion in 2019.Africas agrochemical market is highly competitive, with imports dominated by countries such as China, Morocco, and Russia.\n\nZimtrade data shows that China alone accounted for US$2.2 billion in exports to African countries in 2023, followed by Morocco at US$1,1 billion and Russia at US$816 million with regional players like South Africa and Egypt, exporting US$685 million and US$563 million, respectively.\n\nThis competitive environment underscores the need for Zimbabwean companies to carve out a niche, potentially focusing on innovative, eco-friendly agrochemicals or leveraging proximity to regional markets to reduce logistical costs.\n\nAnalysis of bilateral trade data between African countries reveals that specific product categories present significant opportunities for Zimbabwean exporters, said ZimTrade.\n\nThe agency said mineral or chemical fertilizers containing nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) dominate regional demand, with imports in African markets reaching US$1,4 billion in 2022. Similarly, products like insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides  essential for improving crop yields, saw imports of US$296 million within African markets in 2023.\n\nThe global and regional agricultural sectors are expanding, and the demand for agrochemicals continues to rise, presenting Zimbabwe with a unique opportunity to tap into these markets and drive export-led growth.\n\nCloser to home, ZimTrade said the demand for fertilizers and crop protection products is growing across Southern Africa due to the regions reliance on agriculture as a key economic activity with the potential for export growth being high particularly in countries such as Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique, which are all experiencing an increase in agricultural activity.\n\nAs demand for fertilizers and crop protection products increases in these countries, Zimbabwean companies are well-positioned to capitalize on this growth by offering cost-effective solutions that cater to the specific agricultural needs of each market, the agency added.\n\n",
