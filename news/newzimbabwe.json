For almost two decades, it sparked conversations in homes, workplaces and social media spaces, providing entertainment that felt authentically local.\n\nIt gave local actors, writers, directors, and production teams a platform to showcase their talents while telling South African stories.\n\nHelga Palmer, group head of local programming and strategy at eMedia, captured the bittersweet nature of this farewell:We are proud of what Scandal! has achieved, not only as a top-rated television property but also as a vital part of South Africas cultural landscape.\n\nWe thank the entire production team, the cast past and present, and our loyal viewers for making this journey extraordinary.\n\ne.tv has extended heartfelt gratitude to Ochre Media, the production company that brought Scandal! to life throughout its run.\n\nStan Joseph, executive producer at Ochre Moving Pictures, reflected on what the series has meant to everyone involved:Producing Scandal! has been an incredible journey and a true labour of love. For close to twenty years, our writers, directors, actors and crew have poured their hearts into bringing authentic South African stories to life.\n\nJoseph continued: We are deeply grateful to e.tv for their trust and to our audiences for their unwavering support. While it is bittersweet to say goodbye, we are proud of the legacy that Scandal! leaves behind.\n\nScandal! will continue to air until the end of June 2026, giving viewers time to process this goodbye while ensuring the series receives the send-off it deserves.\n\nFor fans, this means they have a few more months to savour every episode, every plot twist, every character moment.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has lifted a two-year asset freeze on properties belonging to businessman Tobias Zangairai, ruling that the Prosecutor-General failed to act on allegations of unexplained wealth despite obtaining an interim order in 2023.\n\nJustice Benjamin Chikowero said it would be unjust to keep the order in place indefinitely without prosecution or civil forfeiture proceedings.\n\nThe order was never meant to remain in force in perpetuity, ruled Justice Chikowero. The Prosecutor-General has not taken advantage of that order by taking positive action. As I write this judgment, no criminal prosecution of the applicant for any serious crime vis--vis some or all of those properties has seen the light of day.\n\nThe case dates back to January 27, 2023, when the court, at the request of the Prosecutor-General, granted an unexplained wealth order and an interim freezing order against Zangairai.\n\nHe was required to explain how he acquired 24 immovable and movable assets, including residential stands across Harare, Bulawayo, Beitbridge, Mutare, and a fleet of vehicles ranging from a Toyota Hilux to a Nissan Civilian bus.\n\nZangairai complied, submitting a sworn statement to the Zimbabwe Republic Polices Asset Forfeiture Unit within the required 30 days.\n\nHowever, since then, the state took no further steps to prosecute him or apply for civil forfeiture.\n\nIn his defence, Zangairai argued that the prolonged freeze violated his constitutional right to use and enjoy his property.\n\nSection 71(2) of Zimbabwes Constitution guarantees every citizen the right to acquire, hold, occupy, use, transfer, hypothecate, lease or dispose of all forms of property.\n\nThe judge criticised the Prosecutor-Generals office for keeping Zangairais assets in limbo for more than two-and-a-half years without justification.\n\nIn these circumstances, it was not surprising that counsel for the first respondent was unable to make any meaningful submissions, Justice Chikowero said.\n\nIt would be unjust not to accede to the application for the setting aside of the interim freezing order.\n\nThe court ruled that Zangairai can now freely deal with his 24 assets, which include prime land in Marlborough, Salisbury Township, Mahatshula in Bulawayo, Chikanga in Mutare, and multiple stands in Beitbridge, along with vehicles such as a Toyota Nadia, Nissan Hardbody, Mazda Capella, and several Toyota Hiace minibuses.\n\nThe High Court formally granted Zangairais application, struck out a related case (HCHACC 130/24), and ordered that each party bear its own legal costs.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nVice President Constantino Chiwenga has once again pledged zero tolerance for tender manipulation and corrupt practices, which continue to plague Zimbabwe and undermine service delivery.\n\nHis latest remarks, delivered Thursday at the Construction Industry Federation of Zimbabwe annual congress in Masvingo, come just days after he reportedly presented an explosive corruption dossier at a Zanu PF Politburo meeting in Harare.\n\nThe dossier is said to have stoked tensions within the ruling party, allegedly prompting President Emmerson Mnangagwa to cut short his trip to the United Nations General Assembly in New York. This at a time when Zimbabwe is lobbying for a seat on the UN Security Council.\n\nWe cannot and will not tolerate corruption, tender manipulation, or unethical dealings that undermine confidence and compromise delivery, Chiwenga declared.\n\nHe painted a grim picture of the damage corruption has done to Zimbabwes global reputation, stressing that economic growth rests on honesty and sacrifice.\n\nAll thriving economies the world over were built through sacrifice, honesty, and hard work, he said. Unethical dealings result in public outrage and diminished consumer confidence, which can significantly damage the reputation of companies and individuals, ultimately affecting future business opportunities and national development.\n\nChiwenga has previously derided corrupt business figures as zvigananda,a Shona term describing those who amass ill-got wealth. While he has not publicly named tycoons such as Wicknell Chivayo, Kudakwashe Tagwirei, or Paul Tungwarara, reports suggest their names feature in the dossier he presented to the Politburo.\n\nControversial businessman Wicknell Chivayo has been implicated in a US$40 million tender awarded by the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) to supply electoral materials for the 2023 general elections, where prices were allegedly inflated by 235%. He was also linked to a scandal over a government contract worth approximately US$437 million for the supply of cancer treatment equipment, awarded without a transparent tendering process.\n\nMnangagwas adviser to the UAE, Paul Tungwarara, through his company Prevail Group International, was contracted under the Presidential Borehole Scheme to drill thousands of solar-powered boreholes across the country, a tender critics say was awarded opaquely.\n\nSimilarly, Sakunda Holdings, a company linked to Kudakwashe Tagwirei, secured contracts worth over US$1 billion to supply inputs under Zimbabwes Command Agriculture scheme without an open tender, with more than US$280 million in funds reported as unaccounted for.\n\nThe VPsanti-graft salvo comes amid an intensifying succession battle between factions loyal to Mnangagwa and Chiwenga, with some analysts warning the rift could escalate to a coup.\n\nMnangagwa recently reshuffled the Politburo, demoting Chiwenga ally Obert Mpofu from the influential post of Secretary General to a less significant ICT portfolioan apparent move to weaken Chiwengas hand in the power struggle.\n\n",
