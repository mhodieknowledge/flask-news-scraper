All eyes will be on Lamar at the New Orleans Caesars Superdome for his performance, which is expected to be mindblowing.\n\nRihanna, Usher, and Beyonce have previously performed at the Super Bowl. In past performances, it is a medley of their top charting songs throughout their careers that make up the 12-13 minute performance.\n\nWith a discography featuring top-charting bangers that have made him a global superstar, curiosity is piqued about whether his set list will include hisGrammy-award-winning song Not Like Us.\n\nWith an ongoing defamation case, it does raise the question of whether Lamar will leave Not Like Us out of his performance.\n\nThe song, a Drake diss track, made history by winning Record of the Year, Best Music Video, Best Rap Song, and Best Rap Performance at the 67th Annual Grammy Awards, held on February 2.\n\nNot Like Us despite its huge success with 1 975 828 412 streams on Spotify and 220,872,679 views on YouTube, makes pedophile claims towards Drake and his team.\n\nSay, Drake, I hear you like em young / You better not ever go to cell block one / To any b***h that talk to him and they in love / Just make sure you hide your lil sister from him.\n\nThey tell me Chubbs the only one that gets your hand-me-downs / And party at the party, playin with his nose now / And Baka got a weird case, why is he around? / Certified Lover Boy? Certified pedophiles.\n\nIn January,Drake filed a lawsuit against Universal Music Group(UMG), accusing the label of defamation and harassment over Lamars incendiary diss track, Not Like Us, which dropped last year.\n\nIn legal papers filed in New York, Drakes lawyers stated that UMG orchestrated a campaign to create a viral hit with Not Like Us, exploiting the controversy to boost streams at Drakes expense.\n\nUMG fired back, calling the claims offensive and untrue. It argued that the idea of them undermining one of their biggest stars is illogical, and accused Drake of trying to stifle Lamars creative freedom through legal means.\n\nFans will only know on Sunday, if Not Like Us will have made the cut or not, but what is known is that SZA will be joining Lamar for the Halftime show.\n\n",

            "content": "Reuters\n\nAt an age when most test cricketers have retired and only an elite few can maintain their excellence, 38-year-old Sean Williams is bucking the trend and soaring to new heights on the cusp of his 20th anniversary representing Zimbabwe.\n\nUpon the retirement of 21-year stalwart Jimmy Anderson last year, Bulawayo-born Williams became world crickets longest-tenured player and his game has only improved with time.\n\nAs his sides premier contemporary batsman, over 17 tests and 162 one-day internationals Williams has averaged 45 and 38 respectively. Since 2020, those numbers skyrocket to 81 and 51  and while captaining, 96 and 73.\n\nIve found that my scoring shot decisions have become way more selective and the percentages have become a lot higher towards me than towards the bowler, the left-hander told Reuters ahead of his Feb. 25 milestone. I just became a little bit calmer as a batsman.\n\nPromoted to the national team in 2005 after a politically-driven player exodus, facing a merciless South Africa was an eye-opening initiation for the then 18-year-old.\n\nWe were obviously young, we had no idea. We were just trying to survive 50 overs, he reflected, noting that coaches of that era tried hard but could not overhaul a negative culture.\n\nThere was fear instilled elsewhere with the board. It just wasnt good and it wasnt nice cricket. There was no plan.\n\nA two-day Cape Town massacre followed, and despite missing test selection Williams still finds humour in a 12th-man memory of teammate Brendan Taylor accidentally knocking himself out after making a low score.\n\nHe had his helmet on, but he smashed his head with the bat and then I got a fright, Williams said. I saw him go dizzy, hit the wall and then slide down the wall and lie down on the floor.\n\nAs a hopelessly-outgunned Zimbabwe retreated from the test arena, it would be eight more years before Williams made his red-ball debut.\n\nWERE GOING TO GET FIRED\n\nThe father-of-two says a positive game plan which reflects modern scoring trends has been welcomed by the playing group over the last decade, as has an off-field culture shift.\n\nAfter a string of disastrous results against Afghanistan last December, Zimbabwe Cricket managing director Givemore Makoni summoned the senior players to his office.\n\nI thought, jeez, were going to get fired here, but he actually had a meeting of support, Williams said.\n\nThats quite a sensitive thing. I mean, its something that people wouldnt know about the board, supporting a player or supporting the seniors.\n\nHes helped me a lot throughout a lot of troubled times, added Williams, who clubbed a career-best 154 in the next test.\n\nZimbabwes next challenge comes against Ireland, who tour the African nation for three T20s, three ODIs and one test starting Feb. 6.\n\nWilliams earmarked 21-year-old Brian Bennett, who collected a century and a five-wicket haul in last years Boxing Day test against the Afghans, as his teams most exciting prospect, alongside uncapped batsman Matthew Welch and paceman Takudzwa Chataira.\n\nAlthough the all-rounder has stepped away from T20 internationals, he hopes to regain fitness for the other legs, even if it means recusing himself from spin-bowling duties, having recently battled nerve pain stemming from a back injury.\n\nThere is no end in sight for the Matabeleland product, however, as he highlights the 2027 ODI World Cup, which his country will co-host with South Africa and Namibia, as the focal point on Zimbabwes calendar.\n\nI will be pushing it quite a bit then, but theyre managing us now so thats a really amazing thing, he said.\n\n",
