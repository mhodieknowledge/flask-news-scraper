            "content": "Sky News\n\nDonald Trump has ambushed South Africas president during a White House meeting by playing a video purportedly showing evidence of a genocide of white people in the African country.\n\nThe US president, who was hosting leader Cyril Ramaphosa in the Oval Office, said the footage showed the graves of thousands of white farmers.\n\nAfter an initial friendly chat where Trump complimented South African golfers in the room, a montage of clips was played as Mr Ramaphosa sat quietly and mostly expressionless. He later said: Id like to know where that is because this [the videos] Ive never seen.\n\nThe lights were dimmed in the Oval Office as the videos were shown, including of South African officials allegedly calling for violence against white farmers.\n\nThe scene in the heart of the White House administration was reminiscent of Mr Trumps ambush of Ukraines Volodymyr Zelenskyy last February.\n\nSouth Africa has rejected the allegation that white people are disproportionately targeted by crime.\n\nThe clips include one of a communist politician playing a controversial anti-apartheid song that includes lyrics about killing a farmer.\n\nTrump accused South Africa of failing to address the killing of white farmers. People are fleeing South Africa for their own safety, the US president said. Their land is being confiscated and in many cases theyre being killed.\n\nAlluding to people in the videos, Trump said: These are people that are officials and theyre saying kill the white farmer and take their land.\n\nThe US president then displayed printed copies of news articles that he said showed white South Africans who had been killed, saying death, death as he flipped through them.\n\nHe added of one article: Heres burial sites all over the place, these are all white farmers that are being buried.\n\nSouth African leader rejects allegations\n\nRamaphosa pushed back against Trumps accusations, by responding: What you saw, the speeches that were being made, that is not government policy. We have a multi-party democracy in South Africa that allows people to express themselves, political parties to adhere to various policies.\n\nAnd in many cases or in some cases, those policies do not go along with government policy.\n\nOur government policy is completely, completely against what he [a person in the video montage] was saying. Even in the parliament. And they are a small minority party which is allowed to exist in terms of our constitution.\n\nRamaphosa also said of the behaviour alleged by Mr Trump: We are completely opposed to that.\n\nRamaphosa said there was crime in South Africa, and the majority of victims were black. Mr Trump cut him off and said: The farmers are not black. The South African president responded: These are concerns we are willing to talk to you about.\n\nExperts in South Africa have said there is no evidence of white people being targeted, although farmers of all races are victims of violent home invasions in a country that suffers from a very high crime rate.\n\n",

It was searched and police suddenly discovered a damaged tracking device removed from the vehicle, said Mashaba.\n\nThe 31-year-old man driving the stolen vehicle could not produce authentic documentation proving ownership, and he was immediately placed under arrest.\n\nThe arrested driver was charged for possession of a suspected stolen motor vehicle.\n\nProvincial police spokesperson in Limpopo, Brigadier Hlulani Mashaba said the grey SUV was reported stolen earlier this month, around Pretoria central.

ZLHR further argues that the impugned provisions of the PVO Amendment Act were vague and badly drafted and contained arbitrary powers and over-regulation of PVOs, said ZLHR.\n\nZLHR also said the PVO Amendment Act has the effect of concentrating arbitrary powers in the Minister of Public Service, Labour and Social Welfare and the Registrars office and contains excessive executive interference in the internal affairs of PVOs.\n\nIt said the impugned provisions of the PVO Amendment Act have the net effect of effectively allowing the Executive to run PVOs and to deregister those that authorities dislike on very nebulous grounds.\n\nTo this end ZLHR is seeking a High Court order of constitutional invalidity, declaring section 4, section 5 as read with section 9(5), section 6, section 13A, section 14, and section 21, of the Private Voluntary Organisations Act (as amended by the PVO Amendment Act) to be ultra vires the Constitution and to be set aside.\n\n",
