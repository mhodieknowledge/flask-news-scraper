            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nIN the aftermath of the discovery of mutilated bodies in Norton recently, legislator Richard Tsvangirai has demanded speedy investigations into the gruesome murders.\n\nNorton was shaken to the core when the mutilated body of a man, Patrice Chipaumire, was discovered on Monday, before another, that of Jack Gedion, was found on Tuesday in disturbing circumstances.\n\nThe images of the bodies have since circulated on social media, with widespread speculation that they might be linked to ritual killings.\n\nIn a statement, Tsvangirai called for quick investigations into the murders that have sent Norton into a state of panic.\n\nI share in the deep sorrow and shock these events have caused. My heartfelt condolences go to the families who have lost their loved ones under such painful circumstances.\n\nPlease know that your grief is our grief, and you are not alone during this time. I have visited the bereaved families to offer my support and solidarity, and I will continue to walk with them through this difficult period.\n\nI have also spoken with law enforcement authorities and investigations are currently ongoing. Justice must not only be done; it must be seen to be done. We will not rest until answers are found and those responsible are held accountable, said Tsvangirai.\n\nTsvangirai also urged for an increase in police patrols in Norton to prevent any recurrence of such tragedies.\n\nI further call for intensified police patrols in the area to reassure residents and enhance community safety. To the people of Norton, I urge you to remain vigilant and avoid unnecessary movement during late hours.\n\nI know fear and uncertainty weigh heavily on us, but let us not lose our sense of community. Let us watch over one another, support the grieving, and remain calm as investigations unfold, said Tsvangirai.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nSouth African opposition politician Julius Malema has been convicted of hate speech by the countrys equality court, following remarks he made at a rally in 2022.\n\nMalema, leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party, often sparks controversy in a nation where, 31 years after apartheid ended, racial tensions still linger.\n\nAfter an incident where a white man allegedly assaulted an EFF member, Malema said: No white man is going to beat me up you must never be scared to kill. A revolution demands that at some point there must be killing.\n\nThe equality court ruled that these remarks demonstrated an intent to incite harm, but the EFF said they were taken out of context.\n\nTwo complaints had been made against the 44-year-old MP  one by South Africas Human Rights Commission and another by a person who alleged they had been threatened because of the politicians remarks.\n\nIn its ruling, the court said: Whilst calling out someone who behaves as a racist may be acceptable, calling for them to be killed is not.\n\nAnd calling for someone to be killed because they are a racist who has acted violently, is an act of vigilantism and an incitement of the most extreme form of harm possible.\n\nIn a subsequent statement, the EFF said the ruling is fundamentally flawed and deliberately misreads both the context and the meaning of the speech.\n\nIt assumes that the reasonable listener is incapable of understanding metaphor, revolutionary rhetoric or the history of liberation struggles, the EFF added.\n\nIn June, Malema, whose party came fourth in last years parliamentary election, was denied entry to the UK.\n\nThe Home Office said he had been deemed non-conducive to the public good.\n\nIn a letter released by the EFF at the time, the Home Office cited his vocal support for Hamas, including a speech he made after the 7 October 2003 attack on Israel in which Malema said his party would arm the group if it came to power.\n\nThe Home Office said Malema had also made statements calling for the slaughter of white people [in South Africa] or hinted that it could be an acceptable option in the future.\n\nThe EFF condemned the UKs decision as cowardice and said it would stifle democratic debate.\n\nMalema were also criticised by US President Donald Trump in aconfrontational meeting with South Africas President Cyril Ramaphosain May.\n\nTrump played a video of the EFF leader singing an anti-apartheid song which refers to white farmers.\n\nMalema often chants the song  which includes the lyrics kill the Boer (Afrikaner); kill the farmer  at his political rallies.\n\nAfrikaner lobby groups have tried to get the song banned, but South Africas Supreme Court of Appeal has ruled that a reasonably well-informed person would understand that when protest songs are sung, even by politicians, the words are not meant to be understood literally, nor is the gesture of shooting to be understood as a call to arms or violence.\n\nWhite-minority rule ended in South Africa in 1994, with anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandelas rise to power.\n\n",
