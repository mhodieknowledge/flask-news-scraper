            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has ruled that businessman Murombo Josiah Mimana must continue supporting his estranged wife, Marvel Mtisi, with monthly maintenance after finding that he had the capacity to pay for the familys upkeep, previously pegged at US$20,000 per month.\n\nJustice Maxwell delivered the judgment on October 9, 2025, granting Mtisi maintenance of US$11,726 per month and ordering Mimana to contribute 80% of her legal costs pending the conclusion of their divorce proceedings.\n\nThe couple, married under an unregistered customary union in 2001, has eight children. Mtisi approached the court seeking a declaration that the marriage had ended and for Mimana to resume the US$20,000 monthly payments he allegedly stopped in February 2025, despite having consistently paid that amount since March 2024.\n\nMtisi told the court she was unemployed and had been excluded from the couples lucrative businesses, despite holding a 50% stake. She said the companies were financially sound, citing lucrative Jet A1 fuel supply contracts and profitable mining operations. She argued Mimana was well able to meet the US$21,936 in monthly expenses and contribute to her legal costs.\n\nMimana denied personally paying the US$20,000, claiming it was the company that had made the payments for the upkeep of the family. He accused Mtisi of failing to account for the funds and said payments stopped after she engaged in activities that disrupted the smooth running of the company.\n\nHe further disputed that she was a shareholder and insisted she was not entitled to dividends or business proceeds.\n\nBut in his ruling, Justice Fatima Maxwell found that Mimana had the means to continue supporting his wife, noting that even if the company had made the payments, it acted on his behalf.\n\nIt is common cause that the applicant has been dependent on the US$20,000 per month she was getting. The bottom line is that she has no source of income except the contribution she was receiving, the judge said.\n\nRespondent has not disputed that he is unilaterally running the company and that the US$20,000 was being paid on his behalf. He is therefore in a position to contribute to the applicants legal costs whether personally or through the company.\n\nThe court trimmed some nonrecurring and tutoring costs from Mtisis claim, disallowing US$10,210 in total, leaving US$11,726 as the payable monthly amount.\n\nOn Mimanas technical objection that Mtisis affidavit was improperly commissioned, the court described it as a desperate attempt by the respondent to avoid going into the merits of the matter.\n\nThe application for maintenance pendente lite and contribution towards costs be and is hereby granted,  she ruled.\n\n",

Emergency services, including paramedics, transport officers, and law enforcement officials, responded swiftly, recovering the deceased and transporting injured passengers to nearby hospitals.\n\nPremier Ramathuba is scheduled to visit the crash site at 11 am on Monday to meet the multi-disciplinary emergency team for updates. She will later address the media and visit hospitals where the injured are receiving care.\n\nThis is a heartbreaking tragedy. Losing so many lives in one incident is painful beyond words. On behalf of the Limpopo Provincial Government, we extend our deepest condolences to the affected families, including those in Zimbabwe and Malawi. We wish a full and speedy recovery to all survivors. Our thoughts and prayers are with them during this difficult time, Ramathuba said.\n\nEarlier, Limpopo Transport MEC Violet Mathye confirmed that the deceased included a 10-month-old baby. She said driver fatigue or a possible mechanical fault could have caused the bus to lose control, though investigations are ongoing.\n\nThe N1 freeway was temporarily closed following the crash. Motorists were advised to use alternative routes: from Makhado to Musina via the Witvlag turnoff, and from Musina to Makhado via the Williespoort turnoff.\n\nThe tragedy follows reports that the bus carried passengers from Zimbabwe and Malawi who were returning home for personal reasons. Rescue operations continued late into Sunday evening, with law enforcement and transport officials coordinating efforts alongside disaster management teams.\n\nThe Limpopo government is also providing psychosocial support to survivors and working with consular services from Zimbabwe and Malawi to assist affected families. Traffic authorities and the South African Police Service continue to investigate the cause of the crash.\n\n",

Why we find ourselves in this situation is both shocking and shameful.\n\nComrade President, on several occasions and even abroad, you have informed the nation that you are a Constitutionalist and yet it is now clear for anyone to see that the so-called 2030 Agenda to extend your term of office is real and alive, and this has now taken us back to the ills that led us to November 2017.\n\nMoreover, the drivers of this so-called 2030 Agenda have now made corruption, looting of our state coffers and bribery of our structures the cornerstone of their contribution to this campaign, and this is now destroying our Party and violating our Constitution.\n\nChiwenga claimed Tagwirei, Nguwaya, Sakupwanya and Chivayo had siphoned over US$3.2 billion from the state in shadowy deals that include the sale of party shares in Tagwireis Kuvimba and Great Dyke Investment, Nguwayas Geo-Pomona initiative, Chivayos Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) scandal and gold purchases by Sakupwanya.\n\nMnangagwa, whose supporters are demanding that he illegally extend his second term to 2030, is said to favour Tagwirei as his successor instead of Chiwenga.\n\nChiwenga is eyeing the top post, having expected to take over in 2023.\n\nAdded Chiwenga: The reality which is clearly emerging is that this 2030 Agenda is being funded and driven by known criminals who have brazenly looted our state coffers with impunity and are now using these resources whose capture and control of our Party is unprecedented and deeply worrying.\n\nKudakwashe Tagwirei, Wicknell Chivhayo, Scott Sakupwanya, and Delish Nguwaya, amongst others, structure and in the process destroy our Party.\n\nChiwenga demanded their immediate arrests, twice telling Mnangagwa that the time for inaction had long passed.\n\nComrade President, tirikuti vanhu ava, Kudakwashe Tagwirei, Wicknell Chivhayo, Scott Sakupwanya, and Delish Nguwaya, and their associates, ngavasungwe, immediately for these unprecedented crimes they have committed, he said.\n\nComrade President, the time for silence and inaction is over, and we cannot allow these criminals who have stolen from our Government coffers and our Party to start using the same resources to bribe fellow comrades and our structures to get their support, defend and protect them.\n\nThe time for silence and inaction is over, Comrade President. We, as the Partys Presidium, have serious issues to immediately deal with that will define our future, and we must immediately prioritise cleaning our house, reclaim our State and our Party from the capture by Kudakwashe Tagwirei, Wicknell Chivhayo, Scott Sakupwanya, and Delish Nguwaya and their associates.\n\nThe leaking of Chiwengas dossier indicates a turning point in Zanu PFs worsening factional fights.\n\nDespite being an obvious escalation of the battle for power between Chiwenga and Mnangagwa, it is the first time private confrontations between the two have been made public.\n\nTheir relationship is reportedly now similar to the one Mnangagwa had with his predecessor, Mugabe.\n\n",
