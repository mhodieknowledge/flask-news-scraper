They are seeking wages of US$2,250, up from their current US$230.\n\nThe lecturers have refused to oversee ongoing examinations, instead picketing outside the university.\n\nThe Association of University Teachers (AUT) Obvious Vengeyi spokesperson stated that the revised demands give the government room to explore other avenues of addressing their grievances while negotiations for the US$2,250 continue.\n\nWe have put across our demand for salaries. We are demanding regional parity, which is the pre-October 2018 salary. We have added non-monetary incentives in case the government cannot provide the US$2,250 immediately.\n\nThis means we have also put in place a roadmap whereby, after every four months, we should be able to discuss a review so that within one year, we should reach regional parity. We have included non-monetary incentives, residential stands, commercial stands, and agricultural land. We have also added a demand for free education.\n\nLecturers here at the University of Zimbabwe were previously required to pay fees if they wished to further their education. We demand that all University of Zimbabwe employees be exempt from paying fees, said Vengeyi.\n\nWATCH | UZ lecturers strike continues, now on day 69\n\n\"Part-final students who are doing dissertations are now being told to bring whatever they have so they can be given marks,\" says AUT spokesperson Obvious Vengei.pic.twitter.com/KLg8rDO934\n\n NewZimbabwe.com (@NewZimbabweCom)June 23, 2025\n\nThe UZ has responded to the strike by suspending the lecturers and replacing them with temporary teachers to oversee examinations.\n\nThe government recently offered a 20 percent increase, a move rejected by the AUT.\n\nThe UZ has not made any response. They have not made any offer, which is why todays picketing emphasised the need for, and demand of, an offer from UZ.\n\nThe Ministry of Higher and Tertiary Education has made an offer of 20% across the board and 35% to the Vice-Chancellor, the very people responsible for this mess have been rewarded, which is quite unfair.\n\nSo, we have put forward our counter-demand in response to the ministrys offer. First and foremost, we reject this 20% as meaningless because if you give someone 20% of US$230, that is essentially nothing, said Vengeyi.\n\n",

Malaria-related deaths also surged from 51 in 2024 to 317 in 2025. The increase in deaths is largely due to delays in accessing treatment, as many cases occurred in remote locations far from health facilities.\n\nAccording to the Ministry of Health, the majority of these were concentrated in just three provinces.\n\nHarare reported 685 cases and Bulawayo reported 67 cases, mainly due to complicated or referred cases.\n\nMalaria also continues to disproportionately affect rural communities in Mashonaland Central, Manicaland, and Mashonaland West.\n\nMeanwhile, government has urged all citizens, especially those in high-risk zones as well as artisanal miners, to take preventive measures such as wearing clothing that covers most of your body when outdoors between sunset and sunrise, use mosquito repellents, sleep in sprayed rooms in districts that receive Indoor Residual Spraying and sleep under an Insecticide Treated Net (ITN) every day. Seek treatment within 24 hours from the Village Health Worker or from the nearest health facility, to prevent progression to severe disease that can lead to death.\n\n",

This vision will continue to gain momentum in 2025. Our approach involves divesting of non-core assets and concentrating resources on high-performing properties in prime locations, he said.\n\nBy streamlining operations and enhancing service standards, Laurie said the company aims to deliver consistent experiences that align with evolving guest expectations prompted by the strategy to allow for greater investment in innovative technologies and sustainability initiatives.\n\nIn keeping with this thrust, the Group has sold the Great Zimbabwe Hotel and earmarked Monomotapa Hotel and Caribbea Bay Resort for sale. These disposals will allow for the prioritisation of the refurbishment of the remaining properties within the portfolio, as well as allocating funds for the development of phase 2 of the Marlborough Sunset Views residential stands, said Ward.\n\nThe Hotels top three performers for the 2024 financial year were Elephant Hills Resort and Conference Centre, Holiday Inn Harare and Holiday Inn Bulawayo. These contributed 54% to the Groups total revenue for the year.\n\nThe hospitality portfolio achieved a combined annual occupancy of 59% for the period under review, a 7% improvement from the 55% achieved in 2023. This equated to almost 15,854 additional room nights sold during 2024.\n\nThe three branded InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) hotels, namely, Holiday Inn Harare, Holiday Inn Bulawayo, and Holiday Inn Mutare, continue to meet all the requirements of the IHG brand standards, having all passed compliance audits in 2024. Additionally, the lease of both the Holiday Inn Harare and Holiday Inn Bulawayo properties were extended for a further 20-year period, added Ward.\n\n",

            "content": "BySikhululekile MashingaidzeandStephen Buchanan-Clarke,Mail & Guardian\n\nAfrica, which holdssignificant estimated sharesof the worlds total reserves of bauxite (24%), cobalt (49.4%), copper (7%), graphite (21%), lithium (6%), manganese (43%), nickel (4.2%) and rare earth minerals (2%), is at the centre of a global race for critical minerals required in the clean energy transition.\n\nExploitation of these resources should help to boost trade, industrialisation and development, but Africas track record is littered with examples to the contrary. Resource booms become drivers of corruption, conflict and ecological destruction and weaken governance institutions.\n\nGiven the continents economic problems, rapidly expanding population and mounting environmental pressures, there is a closing window of opportunity to ensure this new wave of mineral extraction breaks from historical patterns to become a catalyst for inclusive economic growth and long-term sustainability.\n\nZimbabwes lithium sector exemplifies both the opportunities and dangers inherent in the global race for critical minerals  a subject explored at a May 2025 conference hosted by the Centre for Natural Resource Governance (CNRG) titledEnsuring Equitable Distribution of Costs and Benefits in Critical Minerals Development.\n\nLithium, used in consumer electronics (including batteries), electric vehicles and renewable energy systems, has become an essential mineral to many of the modern industries driving economic prosperity and the global transition to clean energy. As drone warfare continues to revolutionise modern warfare, access to lithium-ion and lithium-polymer batteries has also become an importantnational defenceissue from Washington to Beijing.\n\nZimbabwe is endowed with substantial lithium reserves. Since 2021, the sector has attracted more than $1.2billion in foreign direct investment, withexportssurging 800%, from $7 million in 2021 to $600million by 2024. Investment in the sector has beendominatedby Chinese companies including Rwizi Rukuru, Shengxiang Investments, Sinomine Resource Group, Chengxin Lithium, Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt and Yahua Group. This investment in the sector has beenhighlightedby Mines and Mining Development Minister Winston Chitando as crucial to the governments wider national developmentstrategy.\n\nBut, asshownin previous research by Good Governance Africa and the CNRG, Zimbabwes mining sector often fails to translate into broad-based economic prosperity. Several mining operations have also been associated with incidents of human rights abuses, corruption and environmental degradation, with local residents disproportionately suffering the adverse consequences.\n\nThe surging demand for Zimbabwes critical minerals presents a defining choice for both government and mining investors: they can either leverage this opportunity to empower local people and foster inclusive development or fall back into familiar patterns of exploitation. During conference proceedings, several measures were highlighted as necessary to maximise Zimbabwes chances of seeing the former option.\n\nFirst, Zimbabwes mining sector requires comprehensive legal and governance reforms to unlock its potential for inclusive development. The current system, which vests mineral rights in the president and is administered through the mines and mining development ministry, creates opacity and excludes key stakeholders from decision-making processes. Transferring these rights to an independent regulatory body subject to parliamentary oversight and accountability would enhance transparency and ensure broader participation in mining agreements.\n\nSimultaneously, fast-tracking the implementation of a comprehensive miningcadastre systemis essential for providing real-time, accurate records of mining claims and licenses. This technological infrastructure would serve as a foundation for reducing corruption, limiting discretionary decision-making and aligning Zimbabwes mining sector with international standards.\n\nSecond, prioritising beneficiation to stimulate industrial development and local job creation is essential. In this respect, Zimbabwe passed theBase Minerals Export Control(2022), which includes a ban on raw lithium exports by 2026 to encourage investment in local processing facilities.\n\nOn 10 June 2025, the minister also announceda banon the export of lithium concentrates by January 2027. Although these measures were designed to maximise benefit through localised processing of lithium, aCNRG press statementin response to the ministers pronouncement noted with concern that this urgent reform is being delayed into irrelevance.\n\nThis, as CNRG further highlighted, should be with immediate effect to prevent further natural capital depletion from unchecked lithium exploitation, which has devastating socio-economic and environmental implications. Zimbabwes lithium wealth risks being squandered, as unchecked exports, weak regulation and opaque deals undermine its potential for industrial transformation. Local minerals beneficiation does not always make economic sense. But, where the opportunity for value addition is clear, it must be taken and supported through coherent industrialisation policies.\n\nFurther to this, China monopolising the sector could undermine these efforts, with Chinese companiesalreadyleveraging their position tounderminelocal beneficiation initiatives. Diversifying investment in the sector by addressing governance issues (currently deterring many Western investors) and leveraging opportunities such as the European Unions Critical Raw Materials Act and the US Minerals Security Partnership (aimed at securing critical mineral supply chains) would help to strengthen Zimbabwes negotiating position.\n\nA good step in this direction was the firstEuropean Union-Zimbabwe Business Forumheld from 20 to 22 May, focused on renewable energy and mining investments, among other aspects.\n\nBeyond diversifying investment partnerships, realising the intentions of the Base Minerals Export Control will also require concerted investment in the infrastructure required for local beneficiation projects to operate effectively, a consistent regulatory environment, and decisive action against corruption.\n\nThird, strategic resource management should balance national sovereignty with economic pragmatism to maximise benefits from Zimbabwes mineral wealth. Moving away from disadvantageous long-term trade agreements while avoiding excessive nationalisation will help Zimbabwe capture fair value during price fluctuations without deterring necessary investment. Central to this approach is the need for long-term planning that addresses resource depletion through economic diversification strategies and sovereign wealth mechanisms, on condition that these be well governed.\n\nFourth, community empowerment andrights protection regarding land and watershould be prioritised to ensure that local populations benefit from, and participate in, decisions affecting their areas. There is a need for ongoing, comprehensive government and civil society-driven capacity building programmes to educate people about critical minerals, associated opportunities and potential risks, enabling informed participation in mining-related decisions. Community involvement is a principle provided for by the Constitution on national development, and in theEnvironmental Management Actt. But the implementation of these provisions remains a problem.\n\nIn this respect, international best practice frameworks such as theVoluntary Principles on Security and Human Rightsprovide useful guidelines on how mining companies, civil society and government can play a role in advancing these goals. But creating the conditions under which these can be effectively implemented will require the Zimbabwean government to address long-run governance and human rights issues, as well as creating an enabling environment for civil society to operate.\n\nFinally, environmental sustainability and social responsibility must guide Zimbabwes approach to critical mineral extraction, ensuring that the pursuit of economic benefits does not compromise long-term environmental and social well-being, particularly for the mining communities. Mining operations should be required to adopt cleaner technologies and implement robust mitigation measures, including cleaner coal technologies, where fossil fuels remain necessary for processing.\n\nHumanising the broader energy transition can be achieved through gradual, community-sensitive steps rather than disruptive changes that harm rural livelihoods.\n\nUpgrading Zimbabwes obsolete energy infrastructure is essential for supporting both mining operations and broader economic development while improving national energy security. By embedding environmental and social considerations into mining policies from the outset, Zimbabwe can position itself as a responsible supplier of critical minerals while building a sustainable foundation for long-term development that benefits all citizens rather than perpetuating historical patterns of exploitation and exclusion.\n\nSikhululekile Mashingaidze is the lead researcher in Good Governance Africas Peace and Security Programme and Stephen Buchanan-Clarke is the head of the programme.\n\n",

            "content": "Cape Town Etc\n\nThe luxury rail industry across Southern Africa held its breath earlier this year when a Rovos Rail train carrying 47 foreign tourists and 34 staff members collided with a freight train on the Bulawayo-Beitbridge line.\n\nNow, after months of investigation and reflection, the companys Chief Operating Officer Tiffany Vos-Thane has broken her silence about what went wrong that fateful morning,Cape {town} Etcreports.\n\nThis incident marked the first major accident in Rovos Rails 20 years of operation along this route, shaking confidence in Africas luxury rail sector.\n\nThe collision derailed several carriages during the Easter holiday journey to Victoria Falls, tragically claiming the life of one staff member weeks later due to medical complications.\n\nWhile no passengers were physically injured, the psychological impact on both guests and crew has been profound, with the company arranging ongoing trauma counselling for affected employees.\n\nAccording toVos-Thane, while final reports are still being compiled, preliminary findings point squarely to a tragic miscalculation by Bulawayo Beitbridge Railway (BBR) operators.\n\nSomebody made a mistake with the timing, which is just so unfortunate, Vos-Thane revealed in an emotional interview. This is particularly devastating considering we use this line twice weekly without incident. Losing a team member has left us grappling with difficult questions, though we must acknowledge this was an isolated failure in an otherwise reliable system.\n\nMeanwhile, the COO praised the extraordinary emergency response from Zimbabwean authorities, with medical teams and railway officials arriving within minutes. This rapid intervention likely prevented further casualties among the shaken passengers and crew.\n\nSurprisingly, the accident appears to have done little to dampen enthusiasm for Rovos Rails luxury experiences. The company reports receiving just one customer query about line safety since the incident, with demand remaining robust despite global economic uncertainties affecting the travel sector.\n\nA recent Tourism Update poll supports this resilience, with 73% of industry respondents affirming luxury travels enduring appeal. Vos-Thane attributes this to Southern Africas stringent rail safety regulations across all ten countries Rovos operates in, which require annual safety permits for all operators.\n\nAddressing concerns about regional rail infrastructure, the COO acknowledged challenges like loadshedding and cable theft causing delays, particularly on South Africas Pretoria-Cape Town route. However, she noted an 80% improvement in timings recently and expressed optimism about government moves toward rail privatisation.\n\nThe more private investment in our railways, the better the infrastructure becomes, Vos-Thane stated. While billions are needed for full rehabilitation, were seeing promising commitment from authorities.\n\nRather than expanding its fleet of 23 locomotives (including eight electric and four hybrids), Rovos Rail will focus on refurbishing existing carriages and elevating service standards. This quality-over-quantity approach aims to reinforce the brands premium positioning while implementing lessons from Aprils tragedy.\n\nThe company continues working closely with BBR to prevent future timing errors, though Vos-Thane stressed such incidents remain exceptionally rare in African luxury rail travel.\n\nFor now, the iconic trains keep rolling across the continents spectacular landscape, carrying travellers seeking unforgettable journeys through Southern Africas heart.\n\n",
