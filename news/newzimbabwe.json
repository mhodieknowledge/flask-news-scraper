            "content": "Xinhua\n\nAccording to the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (TIMB), the sector is witnessing record-breaking sales this year, with farmers already delivering more than 340 million kg of the golden leaf to the market, a significant hike from about 240 million kg last year.\n\nA warm, earthy scent filled the grading shed as workers carefully sorted tobacco leaves at a farm in Beatrice, a rural area in Zimbabwes Mashonaland East Province.\n\nWith practiced hands, they ensured each golden leaf met the high standards demanded by buyers.\n\nOutside, a truck loaded with tightly packed bales rumbled toward the market, trailing dust along the winding country roads.\n\nIn general, this growing season has been a very good one for most tobacco growers, especially the small-scale farmers. They have done exceptionally well, and overall, everyone has had a better yield per hectare than ever before, said Steve Riley, a tobacco farmer who has invested heavily in the crop, one of Zimbabwes most lucrative exports.\n\nUtilizing both rainfall and irrigation facilities at his farm, Riley successfully cultivated quality tobacco on 34 hectares of land last season. The harvest is now being delivered to the market.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, the tobacco marketing season, running from March to August, is a critical period in the agricultural calendar, given the crops role as one of the countrys top economic drivers and export earners.\n\nFor farmers like Riley, the marketing season is the most anticipated time of year, offering the long-awaited opportunity to reap the rewards of months of hard work and commitment in the fields.\n\nThanks to these sustained efforts, Zimbabwes tobacco output is on the rise, further reinforcing the countrys position as Africas leading tobacco producer.\n\nAccording to the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board (TIMB), the sector is witnessing record-breaking sales this year, with farmers already delivering more than 340 million kg of the golden leaf to the market, a significant hike from about 240 million kg last year.\n\nThis surge in production is attributed to several factors, including favorable rainfall, increased cultivated land, and a rising number of farmers, especially small-scale producers.\n\nTobacco hectarage expanded from 113,000 hectares in the 2023-2024 season to 125,000 hectares in the 2024-2025 season, according to TIMB. The number of registered growers also rose by 11 percent during the same period, reaching 127,311.\n\nFollowing a successful farming and selling season, Riley is already preparing seedlings for the next planting cycle.\n\nWe dont know what the weather is going to bring us next season. It could be a terrible drought, but we plan as if its going to be a decent season, he said.\n\nChina, one of Zimbabwes key trading partners, remains the largest importer of Zimbabwean tobacco, drawn by its high quality.\n\nOurs, in a nutshell, is a bit like the sugar in a cup of tea. It adds the flavor. And they (the Chinese) need the flavor, and Zimbabwean tobacco seems to be the quality theyre really looking for, said Riley.\n\nAccording to statistics from the Chinese Embassy in Zimbabwe, tobacco exports to China increased by 17.3 percent in 2024.\n\nThe growing demand for Zimbabwean tobacco in international markets has spurred employment and economic activity in rural communities where the crop is cultivated. The government and industry stakeholders are now working to boost production, increase local value addition, and grow exports in the coming seasons.\n\nTacla Munemo, a farm head forewoman, said this season has been productive, and preparations for the next season are already in progress.\n\nWe are expecting another yield like this next season. We have to work hard to achieve another bumper harvest and maintain the quality of the tobacco, she said.\n\n",

            "content": "AP\n\nThe program known as PEPFAR is one of the most effective and popular U.S. foreign aid projects in history, and the government says it has saved the lives of over 25 million people around the world with HIV.\n\nBut despite years of bipartisan support, PEPFAR has faced a severe threat as the Trump administration dismantles most U.S. foreign aid.\n\nPEPFAR on Tuesday appeared to be spared a $400 million cut as Republicans acted in rare defiance of a request by President Donald Trump. But governments, health experts and people with HIV around the world are alarmed by the effects of other U.S. aid cuts and chaos that are already disrupting the crucial supply of HIV drugs  which are meant to be taken daily.\n\nHeres a look at PEPFAR and how it affects millions of people globally.\n\nToday, many babies are born infection-free to mothers with HIV  the U.S. State Department says PEPFAR has been responsible for 5.5 million such births  and most people around the world no longer see an infection as a death sentence.\n\nGovernments in Africa and elsewhere had even begun to worry about complacency as people, especially youths, took the widespread availability of HIV drugs for granted. In another significant step forward, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recently approved for use the worlds only twice-a-year shot to prevent HIV.\n\nBut the abrupt U.S. aid cuts have health officials in developing countries warning of a return to the early days of the AIDS pandemic, when drugs were nonexistent or severely limited and clinics were filled with the dying. PEPFAR was launched in 2004 in response to those grim scenes.\n\nAlso known as the U.S. Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the program has partnered with nonprofit groups to provide HIV medication  including the preventative PrEP  to millions around the world. It has strengthened national health care systems, cared for children orphaned by AIDS and provided job training for people at risk. It has played an important role in testing for and tracking HIV infections.\n\nHIV/AIDS has no cure, and it has killed over 40 million people globally over the years. Now the U.N. agency on AIDS is warning that analysis suggests 4 million additional AIDS-related deaths between now and 2029, including 300,000 additional childrens deaths, if programs permanently lose PEPFARs support.\n\nSince PEPFARs creation by Congress and Republican President George W. Bush, the program has largely enjoyed support across the political spectrum  and gratitude from countries whose health systems have been poorly equipped to care for millions with HIV.\n\nBut misinformation has crept in. The Heritage Foundation, an influential conservative Washington think tank, accused the Biden administration of using PEPFAR to promote its domestic radical social agenda overseas. Conservatives claimed there were efforts to integrate abortion with HIV/AIDS prevention, a claim the Biden administration denied. Similar claims linger under the Trump administration.\n\nTrump and his officials also claim widespread waste and fraud as they seek to dismantle U.S. foreign aid. But PEPFAR has been repeatedly scrutinized. Last year, the government said the State Departments Office of Inspector General had conducted 80 audits, inspections, and special reviews that included oversight of PEPFAR programs, including 21 thematic reviews and audits specifically focused on PEPFAR.\n\nThe $400 million proposed cut to PEPFAR still could be restored, in part or in full, as the bill on spending cuts faces a final vote in the Senate, a vote in the House of Representatives and Trumps signature before a Friday deadline.\n\nWe must stay vigilant, International AIDS Society President Beatriz Grinsztejn said in a statement Wednesday after PEPFAR appeared to be spared.\n\nNo matter what, countries and health experts say it will be impossible to fill the funding gap left by the overall U.S. withdrawal of billions of dollars in aid for the global HIV response, including via PEPFAR.\n\nLast month, a UNAIDS report said the abrupt cuts have destabilized supply chains, led to the closure of health facilities, left thousands of health clinics without staff, set back prevention programs, disrupted HIV testing efforts and forced many community organizations to reduce or halt their HIV activities.\n\nSouth Africa, where more people live with HIV than anywhere else in the world, has said 12 specialized HIV clinics that were funded by the U.S. have had to close down and over 8,000 health workers in its national HIV program are out of work.\n\nNow health workers there and elsewhere are trying to track down an unknown number of people who have lost access to HIV medication. The stakes are deadly. Stopping the drugs allows the virus to start multiplying again. HIV can rebound to detectable levels in peoples blood in just a few weeks, putting sexual partners at risk. The virus could even become drug-resistant.\n\nIt has really been hectic for us, said Mbonisiwe Hlongwane, manager of the HIV program at the Bertha Gxowa public hospital in Germiston, east of Johannesburg. And the uncertainty only continues.\n\n",

The courts upheld the recalls, leaving Chamisa with no option but to step aside.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Thursday, Chamisa confirmed that his decision to leave the CCC was motivated by a desire to spite Mnangagwa.\n\nThe best decision I ever made in my leadership journey was to walk away from MDC & CCC. You will thank me later. I had to break the cycle of going in circles. And that was my best way to teach ED a lesson!, Chamisa declared.\n\nThis was not Chamisas first departure from a major political entity.
