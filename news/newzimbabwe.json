            "content": "BBC\n\nSouth African opposition politician Julius Malema has been convicted of hate speech by the countrys equality court, following remarks he made at a rally in 2022.\n\nMalema, leader of the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) party, often sparks controversy in a nation where, 31 years after apartheid ended, racial tensions still linger.\n\nAfter an incident where a white man allegedly assaulted an EFF member, Malema said: No white man is going to beat me up you must never be scared to kill. A revolution demands that at some point there must be killing.\n\nThe equality court ruled that these remarks demonstrated an intent to incite harm, but the EFF said they were taken out of context.\n\nTwo complaints had been made against the 44-year-old MP  one by South Africas Human Rights Commission and another by a person who alleged they had been threatened because of the politicians remarks.\n\nIn its ruling, the court said: Whilst calling out someone who behaves as a racist may be acceptable, calling for them to be killed is not.\n\nAnd calling for someone to be killed because they are a racist who has acted violently, is an act of vigilantism and an incitement of the most extreme form of harm possible.\n\nIn a subsequent statement, the EFF said the ruling is fundamentally flawed and deliberately misreads both the context and the meaning of the speech.\n\nIt assumes that the reasonable listener is incapable of understanding metaphor, revolutionary rhetoric or the history of liberation struggles, the EFF added.\n\nIn June, Malema, whose party came fourth in last years parliamentary election, was denied entry to the UK.\n\nThe Home Office said he had been deemed non-conducive to the public good.\n\nIn a letter released by the EFF at the time, the Home Office cited his vocal support for Hamas, including a speech he made after the 7 October 2003 attack on Israel in which Malema said his party would arm the group if it came to power.\n\nThe Home Office said Malema had also made statements calling for the slaughter of white people [in South Africa] or hinted that it could be an acceptable option in the future.\n\nThe EFF condemned the UKs decision as cowardice and said it would stifle democratic debate.\n\nMalema were also criticised by US President Donald Trump in aconfrontational meeting with South Africas President Cyril Ramaphosain May.\n\nTrump played a video of the EFF leader singing an anti-apartheid song which refers to white farmers.\n\nMalema often chants the song  which includes the lyrics kill the Boer (Afrikaner); kill the farmer  at his political rallies.\n\nAfrikaner lobby groups have tried to get the song banned, but South Africas Supreme Court of Appeal has ruled that a reasonably well-informed person would understand that when protest songs are sung, even by politicians, the words are not meant to be understood literally, nor is the gesture of shooting to be understood as a call to arms or violence.\n\nWhite-minority rule ended in South Africa in 1994, with anti-apartheid icon Nelson Mandelas rise to power.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has thrown out British businessman Nicholas van Hoogstratens attempt to resurrect a 2009 lawsuit over a luxury Harare property, ruling that the case was long dead and any order now would be a brutum fulmen  an empty thunderbolt with no effect.\n\nJustice Joel Mambara, sitting at the Harare High Court, dismissed the application, saying Van Hoogstraten had waited far too long to act and could not revive a claim that had lain dormant for 16 years.\n\nThe horse has bolted  the ship has sailed  and it would offend the sound administration of justice to pretend otherwise, the judge said.\n\nAt the heart of the dispute is Stand No. 4 Wroxham Road, The Grange, which Van Hoogstraten bought at a 2005 sheriffs auction.\n\nHe argued that the sale gave him indefeasible rights and accused the judgment debtor, Felistas Runyararo James, of colluding with officials to block the transfer.\n\nBut James later sold the property to the Richard Samaita Family Trust in 2013, which still holds title and was not cited in the proceedings.\n\nVan Hoogstraten applied this year to reinstate his old summons and compel James to transfer the property.\n\nMambara ruled that under Practice Direction 1 of 2022, his case had already lapsed after years of inaction.\n\nLitigation must never be an eternal right without regulated time frames failure to have such cut-off time frames will result in endless suits, the judge said, stressing the need for finality.\n\nThe court found that Van Hoogstraten had offered only a partial explanation for his delay, pointing to bureaucratic hurdles in retrieving an archived file, but ultimately failed to show good cause.\n\nEven more decisively, Justice Mambara said the relief sought was now futile: It would be absurd to order the first respondent to sign transfer forms for a property she sold 12 years ago and no longer owns. Courts do not engage in ceremonial exercises or issue orders that are empty of practical force.\n\nThe judge also noted that Van Hoogstraten never actually paid for the house, since the sheriff returned his cheque uncashed years ago.\n\nWhat the applicant is asking the court to do is to order specific performance when he has not paid a cent for the property. In effect, he will get the property for free.\n\nDismissing the application in its entirety, Justice Mambara concluded: There comes a point when even a meritorious claim must yield to the greater good of certainty and finality. That point has long passed in this case.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has unveiled plans to launch newly designed ZWG notes, effectively dumping the old defiled versions in a move set to trigger yet another wave of shock across the markets.\n\nIntroduced on April 5 2024, as the countrys lasting solution to currency problems, the ZWG has suffered major setbacks since its inception, including the 43% devaluation in September 2024, which left the local units gold-backed status in question.\n\nThe currency is still in short supply, with the rural economy having very limited access to the local unit despite being the most populous. Some regions have resorted to using the rand as a medium of exchange, especially for smaller denominations in transactions.\n\nIn the midst of another storm following the announcements that the country will adopt the ZWG as the sole currency in 2030, RBZ governor, Dr John Mushayavanhu, on Tuesday told a state-run publication that plans to launch a new version of ZWG notes were currently underway.\n\nThe Reserve Bank is working on the modernisation of the ZiG banknote series as advised in the recent mid-term Monetary Policy Statement. The new ZiG banknotes will be redesigned, including improved quality and durability for the convenience of the transacting public.\n\nIn this regard, the production process of the improved banknotes has progressed well and is at an advanced stage. The public will be advised of the expected roll-out at the appropriate time, he said.\n\nSceptics immediately took to social media platforms questioning the rationale behind the new designs, with many concluding it is a ploy to dump the failed first version.\n\nMarket watchers who anonymously spoke to our publication criticised the ghostly nature of RBZ announcements for creating more headaches than solutions.\n\nThey are of the view that the RBZ must accompany its policy announcements with finer details to avoid market speculation.\n\nOn his part, Mushayavanhu said the new notes must not be misconstrued as a new currency but just a normal routine in line with global best practices.\n\n",
