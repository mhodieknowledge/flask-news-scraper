            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nMovement for Democratic Change (MDC) leader Douglas Mwonzora has stressed the importance of unity among opposition parties in Zimbabwe, urging them to work together to reverse the trend of poor electoral performance.\n\nHis remarks follow the recently held Epworth ward 6by-election,where the ruling party Zanu PFs candidate Civilised Bushe secured 3,022 votes, beating MDC-Ts Alice Nyahunzvi, who managed just 120 votes. Independent candidate Peter Nyapetwa received only 23 votes. The main opposition party, Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), did not participate in the by-election.\n\nMwonzora, who boycotted the 2023 presidential elections, surprisingly fielded a candidate in Epworth who performed poorly, triggering widespread criticism from opposition supporters.\n\nSpeaking in an X space on Wednesday, Mwonzora said the by-election was a test to assess whether the Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) had implemented electoral reforms.\n\nZEC produced a document called a strategy towards free and fair elections, so we decided to test ZECs attempted electoral reforms empirically. ZEC failed dismally in the test.\n\nThere was rampant vote buying, as Epworth residents were being given food hampers on election day. We have video evidence of that. People were receiving EcoCash and being told to vote for Zanu PF.\n\nThey also received threats from Zanu PF and were told that if they voted for the MDC, the 16,000 houses in Epworth would be destroyed.\n\nWe, the MDC party, were given a soft copy of the voters roll, but it would not open. We made a formal complaint to ZEC, which did nothing about it, Mwonzora said.\n\nMwonzora urged other opposition parties to unite against Zanu PF instead of mocking him for losing the by-election.\n\nThe poor performance is not confined to the MDC; it is a trend, and as the opposition, we must work to change it.\n\nThere is a need to bury the hatchet. As we have seen, there is no winner in a losing team. We need to work together. If we are not careful, Zimbabwe will become a mono-state.\n\nYes, we may want to score political points by mocking the MDC, which lost only one by-election, yet other opposition parties lost 45, Mwonzora said.\n\n",

            "content": "The Guardian\n\nLove potatoes? Well, theres good news and theres bad news.\n\nEating chips has been found to raise the risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but baking, boiling or mashing potatoes was much healthier.\n\nConsuming french fries three times a week increases the chances of someone getting the disease by 20%  and doing so five times a week by 27%  according to a study published in the British Medical Journal.\n\nGlobally, potatoes are thethird most commonly consumed food crop, after rice and wheat.\n\nNine out of 10 of the estimated 5.8 million people in the UK with diabetes have the type 2 version of the disease, which is closely associated with lifestyle, especially diet.\n\nThe findings confirm potatoes do not of themselves pose a danger to health, but frying them to turn them into chips, and eating them regularly, does make a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes more likely.\n\nAn international team of researchers, led by Seyed Mohammad Mousavi, a public health expert at Harvard University, investigated the relationship between potato intake and the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. They based their findings on food questionnaires filled out by 205,000 health professionals in the US every four years between 1984 and 2021.\n\nSomeone who eats chips three times a week was found to raise their risk of diabetes by 20%, but those who ate potatoes with the same regularity after baking, boiling or mashing them did so by only 5%.\n\nThe high starch content of potatoes, leading to a high glycemic index and load, combined with possible loss of nutrients and possible health risks resulting from various cooking methods, could contribute to adverse health outcomes, the study explains.\n\nReplacing potatoes with whole grains lowers the risk of diabetes by 8%, and if grains are eaten instead of chips specifically, that cuts the risk by 19%.\n\nDr Kawther Hashem, a lecturer in public health nutrition at Queen Mary University of London, said: Potatoes can be part of a healthy diet, but its how we prepare them that makes the difference. Boiled, baked or mashed potatoes are naturally low in fat and a source of fibre, vitamin C and potassium.\n\nBut when we deep fry them into chips or french fries, especially in large portions and with added salt, they become less healthy with their high-fat, salt and calorie content thats much more likely to contribute to weight gain and increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.\n\nHowever, replacing any form of potatoes with white rice is a bad idea as it leads to an increased risk of type 2 diabetes, the paper found.\n\nDr Hashem added: This research reinforces the simple message, which is to enjoy potatoes  just dont rely on chips as your go-to option. And, where possible, try swapping them out for whole grains like brown rice, bulgur wheat, wholemeal pasta or even sweet potato with skin on, which are healthier and protective for long-term health.\n\nThe researchers stressed their findings were observational and did not prove a cause and effect relationship between eating chips and type 2 diabetes risk.\n\nThe Food Standards Agency and Department of Health and Social Care both declined to comment.\n\n",

In a Tuesday announcement, Meta said it was also rolling new tools on WhatsApp to help people spot scams  including a new safety overview that the platform will show when someone who is not in a users contacts adds them to a group, as well as ongoing test alerts to pause before responding.\n\nScams arebecoming all too commonand increasingly sophisticated in todays digital world  withtoo-good-to-be-trueoffers and unsolicited messages attempting to steal consumers information or money filling our phones, social media and other corners of the internet each day. Meta noted that some of the most prolific sources of scams are criminal scam centers, which oftenspan from forced laboroperated by organized crime  and warned that such efforts often target people on many platforms at once, in attempts to evade detection.\n\nThat means that a scam campaign may start with messages over text or a dating app, for example, and then move to social media and payment platforms, the California-based company said.\n\npointed to recent scam efforts that it said attempted to use its own apps  as well as TikTok, Telegram and AI-generated messages made using ChatGPT  to offer payments for fake likes, enlist people into a pyramid scheme and/or lure others into cryptocurrency investments. Meta linked these scams to a criminal scam center in Cambodia  and said it disrupted the campaign in partnership with ChatGPT makerOpenAI.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has ended a protracted deadlock between Powertel Communications (Pvt) Ltd and Dandemutande Investments (Pvt) Ltd by ordering the appointment of a sole arbitrator to preside over their long-running contractual dispute, after nearly seven years of failed arbitration efforts.\n\nIn a ruling delivered by Justice Maxwell Takuva, the court criticised Dandemutande for obstructing the arbitration process and held that Powertel had met the legal requirements to invoke the High Courts intervention under Article 11(4) of the Arbitration Act [Chapter 7:15].\n\nThe applicant still yearns for redress and their agreement provides that unless the parties agree to the jurisdiction of the courts, their dispute shall be resolved through the arbitration process. However, without agreeing on the appointment of the arbitrator, the dispute remains unresolved, noted the judge.\n\nThe dispute arose from a 2010 Internet Capacity Purchase Agreement between the two telecoms companies.\n\nClause 27 of the agreement required that all disputes be referred to arbitration, unless the parties consented to the jurisdiction of Zimbabwean courts.\n\nA rift emerged in 2017 after Dandemutande terminated the agreement and allegedly failed to pay a debt of over US$2.29 million claimed by Powertel.\n\nThe parties initially agreed to appoint retired Justice Vernanda Ziyambi as arbitrator in 2018, but the arbitration never materialised because Dandemutande, the claimant at the time, failed to file its claim.\n\nJustice Ziyambi later withdrew from the process due to unavailability.\n\nIn 2023, Powertel approached the Commercial Arbitration Centre seeking a new arbitrator, leading to the appointment of Dr. Whatman.\n\nHowever, Dandemutande objected, and the arbitrator ruled that the matter was improperly before him and terminated proceedings by consent.\n\nPowertel then turned to the High Court for relief.\n\nDandemutande opposed the application, raising two preliminary points  that the claim had prescribed and that the relief sought was incompetent.\n\nOn prescription, the court found that no actual claim had been filed before it, only an application for appointment of an arbitrator.\n\nThe preliminary point on prescription lacks merit, Takuva held.\n\nSuch a point could only be raised before the forum dealing with the applicants claim.\n\nThe court also dismissed the second objection, ruling that while Powertel had proposed the Chairman of the Commercial Arbitration Centre to recommend an arbitrator, that proposal did not usurp the courts discretion.\n\nThe relief sought is incompetent because it takes away the discretion of the Court in appointing an arbitrator, said the judge.\n\nHowever, this does not prejudice the respondent in any way The Court retains the discretion on who to appoint.\n\nThe court was further scathing of Dandemutandes silence in the face of multiple attempts by Powertel to restart arbitration.\n\nIn my view, by so doing the respondent was not being fair to the applicant, said Justice Takuva. Whatever its reasons, it should have at least communicated its reasons The respondents non-cooperation in appointing an arbitrator was deliberate and has forced the applicant to institute litigation.\n\nHe then ruled in favour of Powertel and authorised the Chairman of the Commercial Arbitration Centre to appoint a sole arbitrator on behalf of the court.\n\nHowever, it declined Powertels request for punitive costs, finding that although Dandemutande had delayed the process, Powertel had also contributed to the delay by waiting five years to revive arbitration after the first attempt failed.\n\nAn order for costs on the ordinary scale will suffice, Justice Takuva concluded.\n\nTakuva ruled that the application for appointment of an arbitrator is granted.\n\nHe said the Chairman of the Commercial Arbitration Centre in Harare is authorised to appoint a suitable arbitrator on behalf of the court.\n\nDandemutande shall pay Powertels costs on the ordinary scale.\n\nThe ruling is expected to restart formal proceedings between the two parties and finally bring closure to one of the telecommunications industrys longest-running contractual disputes.\n\n",
