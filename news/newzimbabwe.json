I lost everything I believed in. I slept on sofas.I continued with dignity and went on.There are so many wars, so many inequalities, so much discrimination. Reading is enriched by the immigrants who are here. Lets not forget the people who work in the NHS, they came to shine when I had aggressive breast cancer.Cllr Mpofu-Coles published her memoir Dear God from Your Poached Egg Breast in 2019, which reflects on her life in Zimbabwe, her battle with cancer and her faith in God.She was elected as a Labour councillor for Whitley three times in a row in 2021, 2022 and 2023.Cllr Mpofu-Coles said: I thank Almighty God for the grace he has given me in my life. Thanks to the residents of Reading for voting for me in 2021, 22 and 23.
