The first phase will see 600,000 prepaid meters installed nationwide, with 320,000 allocated to Harare. The remainder will be distributed to Bulawayo, Gweru, Mutare, and Victoria Falls.The living legend took to social media, arguing that the policy is a cruel and exploitative practice that preys on the poor.Pre-paid/pay first. If these are the ways to make money, then they are evil. The PAY FIRST system is for the POOR to increase their poverty and suffering in their lives, but for those who are rich, there is no suffering, Chipanga said.He added that, Everything is now pre-paid. Drinking water, electricity, the radio, walking on the road, standing in town. The last straw is the toilet.The veteran musician recalled a time when public services were covered by council taxes, but now even elderly people are victims of the councils Pay First services.I was not born today. We grew up using these toilets. The council used to have workers for the toilets and for collecting rubbish in these towns, which means we paid for the toilets through the council that built them.Today, youre saying that a person, or even my grandfather from the rural areas, should have money in his pocket to use a toilet? Is this what you call Human Rights in English?
