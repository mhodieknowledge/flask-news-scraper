            "content": "By BBC\n\nPOPE Leo has held an audience with Hollywood stars, urging actors and directors including Cate Blanchett, Viggo Mortensen and Monica Bellucci to continue their work as pilgrims of the imagination, helping to bring hope.\n\nThe celebrity meeting was a sprinkling of star dust for a still relatively new pope and a way for the Catholic Church to engage more with the world beyond.It was also a strong show of support from Leo XIV for the global film industry, as he spoke out against the troubling decline in cinema-going.Hailed by director Spike Lee as a great day, the gathering was the first of its kind in the Vatican.Beneath the magnificent frescoes of the Clementine Hall, Pope Leo spoke in Italian to praise the power of cinema to entertain and to educate  and for its capacity to amaze.But he urged filmmakers not to shy away from what he called the worlds wounds.Violence, poverty, exile, loneliness, addiction and forgotten wars are issues that need to be acknowledged and narrated, the Pope said.Good cinema does not exploit pain; it recognizes and explores it. This is what all the great directors have done.Six months since a conclave of cardinals elected the first North American to the Papacy, some Catholics feel that Leo has been slow to stamp his own mark on the role.His predecessor, Francis, was a charismatic Argentinian known for his off-the-cuff comments and dramatic gestures. Leos style is far quieter, so this star-studded engagement is a new look.Its not clear how the cast list was drawn up, although none of the directors in the hall  who came from all over the world  made it onto the Popes own top film list.This week, the Vatican revealed that his favourite four watches of all time included the 1960s nun-themed classic The Sound of Music, Its a Wonderful Life and Italian Roberto Benignis multi award-winning Life is Beautiful.Among those who did join todays A-list audience were Mortensen, Chris Pine and filmmaker Gus Van Sant  of Milk and Good Will Hunting fame. The large Italian contingent included Gianni Amelio and Cinema Paradiso creator, Giuseppe Tornatore.At a time of immense pressure on film, not long after a major Hollywood strike and with funding strains here in Italy, the Pope spoke in defence of the industry.He was applauded loudly when he talked of the quiet dedication of all those behind the scenes with vital roles.He also warned against the closure of cinemas which he characterised as the beating heart of communities.More than a few people are saying that the art of cinema and the cinematic experience are in danger. I urge institutions not to give up, but to cooperate in affirming the social and cultural value of this activity, the Pope said.After a fifteen-minute speech and a blessing he then received each audience member in turn, led by Blanchett.He really urged us to go back into our day jobs and inspire people, the Australian-born star told reporters.One of many who came bearing gifts, the actress  who works with the UN refugee agency, UNHCR  placed a woven bracelet in the Popes hand. It was a bracelet I wear in solidarity with people who are displaced, she explained later.Lee handed the Chicago-born Pope a New York Knicks shirt printed with the number 14 and the words Pope Leo.\n\nThe celebrity meeting was a sprinkling of star dust for a still relatively new pope and a way for the Catholic Church to engage more with the world beyond.\n\nIt was also a strong show of support from Leo XIV for the global film industry, as he spoke out against the troubling decline in cinema-going.Hailed by director Spike Lee as a great day, the gathering was the first of its kind in the Vatican.Beneath the magnificent frescoes of the Clementine Hall, Pope Leo spoke in Italian to praise the power of cinema to entertain and to educate  and for its capacity to amaze.But he urged filmmakers not to shy away from what he called the worlds wounds.Violence, poverty, exile, loneliness, addiction and forgotten wars are issues that need to be acknowledged and narrated, the Pope said.Good cinema does not exploit pain; it recognizes and explores it.

This entitlement they have to South Africa is sickening.She added that the more South African government keeps nursing Zimbabweans and making them feel like they have rights, the more they start believing they have bigger rights than South Africans.Ngobese-Zuma said the influx of undocumented Zimbabweans has created resentment among locals, describing their attitude as intrusive and entitled.Ngobese-Zuma: Zimbabwean men have become cowardsThe activist went further, calling Zimbabwean men cowards for fleeing their country instead of confronting their political leadership.The reason we have entitled people like Dube here is because the men of Zimbabwe have become cowards. They no longer want to fight for Zimbabwe, they want to fight for South Africa, she said.She urged Zimbabweans to return home and challenge President Emmerson Mnangagwas regime instead of depending on South Africa for economic refuge.Whether there is Operation Dudula or March in March, that is none of Zimbabweans business.
