            "content": "Tobacco Reporter\n\nTwo weeks after topping 300 million kilograms of tobacco output for the first time, Zimbabwean officials say this years crop should top 330 million kg, and that achieving 400 million kg in the future is within reach. According to the Tobacco Industry and Marketing Board, on June 27, the harvest reached 319.2 million kg.\n\nDriving the surge is a sharp increase in smallholder participation, government-led reforms, and research-driven innovations. More than 127,000 farmers, 85% of them smallholders, are registered this season, which ensures access to inputs, training, and markets.\n\nDr. Frank Magama, CEO of Kutsaga, Zimbabwes leading tobacco research institute, credited the Tobacco Value Chain Transformation Plan introduced in 2021 for boosting productivity through better farming practices, climate-smart seed varieties, and sustainability initiatives.\n\nOver 80% of our crop was produced under contract, ensuring inputs, technical support, and guaranteed markets, Magama said. While expansion has occurred, what is more exciting is the productivity increase per unit area. With improved post-harvest handling, energy-efficient barns, and better training, the numbers are speaking for themselves.\n\nHe also warned, however, of the risks from global oversupply and stressed the importance of environmental compliance to maintain competitiveness.\n\n",

In addition to the new post which he can keep for life, constitutional reform in Togo has ended presidential elections, and introduced a parliamentary system.\n\nLast months arrest and psychiatric detention of the Togolese rapper Narcisse Essow Tchalla, also known as Aamron, acted as a catalyst for public outrage, culminating in over 50 arrests during protests earlier this month.\n\nThough most have been released, at least three people remain in custody.\n\n",

Members who debated and spoke, yet they cannot show their love for the country because hospitals do not have medication.\n\nAccording to me, how can you say that you are not in love with your country when it lacks medication in hospitals? That alone is not sufficient because it does not mean that tomorrow we are not going to have the medication, said Murambiwa.\n\nMurambiwa added that there should be a law that punishes government critics.\n\nThe most important issue is to love our country, let us praise our country in all circumstances, whether in good or in bad times, during the night or during the day. Let us love our country.\n\nI also suggest that this august House must come up with a law which states that those who speak evil of their country must face the full wrath of the law and then be jailed.\n\nZANU PF has long been mooting a law that criminalises speaking ill of the country under the guise of patriotism.\n\nPushing ahead with the National Ideologya replica of ZANU PFs Herbert Chitepo School of Ideologythe ruling party plans to incorporate it into the education curriculum.\n\nHowever, this has been resisted by opposition legislators, who fear the National Ideology will be used to clamp down on dissenting voices.\n\nOpposition MP Prosper Mutseyami said Zimbabwe risks degenerating into authoritarianism.\n\nWhat then is true patriotism? Patriotism is not blind loyalty. It is not empty slogans. It is a conscious love for our country that demands honest reflection, accountability and action.\n\nTrue patriots question injustice, challenge corruption and demand systems that serve the people, not select a few. It is the voice that speaks when citizens are denied opportunities, when our youth struggle for employment, and when economic policies fail to uplift the masses.\n\nOur patriotism must ignite participation, ensuring that every Zimbabwean plays an active role in shaping the future, said Mutseyami.\n\n",
