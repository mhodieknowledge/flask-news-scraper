            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nOPPOSITION Member of Parliament Charlton Hwende has made a bold demand for substantial housing loans for legislators, stating that the US$40,000 provided in the past is not enough.\n\nThe Kuwadzana constituency legislator has called for government to budget a minimum of US$150,000 for each lawmaker to acquire a home.Hwende tabled the request during a pre-budget seminar in Bulawayo last week, arguing that the previous loan amount was inadequate, especially when compared to the benefits received by members of the Executive.He also used the platform to criticise the Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube for failing to hike parliamentary salaries.Contributing to the debate on the national budget, Hwende directly addressed the issue of legislator welfare. He lamented the governments failure to provide funds for MPs to build on residential stands they had been allocated. The MP framed his request not as a luxury, but as a necessary provision for those serving the public.We received housing loans worth US$40,000 (approx. R720,000), but because of inflation and compared to what those in the Executive received, we also want you to budget a minimum of US$150,000 (approx. R2.7 million) as a loan that will ensure an MP gets a house, Hwende said.This is not the first time the difficult conditions faced by MPs have been raised. Just weeks earlier, in October 2025, the National Assembly saw heated exchanges over the same topic. Another opposition legislator, Dzivaresekwa MP Edwin Mushoriwa spoke emotionally, declaring that MPs were struggling for survival.Mushoriwa linked the death of Nkulumane MP Desire Moyo to Parliaments failure to support its members. Moyo died in a car accident on October 10, 2025, after his vehicle collided with an elephant. Mushoriwa claimed the fatal crash occurred after Moyo had delayed his trip waiting for overdue fuel coupons.One of the reasons why Hon. Moyo and others were involved in an accident is that they received their coupons around 8:00 pm in this Parliament. If Members of Parliament are not respected and if this august House is not given the honour that it deserves, if we have a situation where we pass the budget but we are treated as if we are third-class citizens in this country, it just does not work, Madam Speaker.The October session revealed that legislators had gone for months without receiving their fuel allocations. Mushoriwa emphasised that this was not merely an inconvenience but a genuine danger that impaired their ability to serve their constituencies. He stated that without proper support, MPs are left exposed and stripped of dignity.Acting Speaker Tsitsi Gezi repeatedly attempted to steer the discussion towards a future caucus meeting, but Mushoriwa insisted the matter was too urgent to delay. He argued that the welfare of MPs was a matter of record, not just for a private meeting, especially after a colleagues death.\n\nThe Kuwadzana constituency legislator has called for government to budget a minimum of US$150,000 for each lawmaker to acquire a home.\n\nHwende tabled the request during a pre-budget seminar in Bulawayo last week, arguing that the previous loan amount was inadequate, especially when compared to the benefits received by members of the Executive.He also used the platform to criticise the Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube for failing to hike parliamentary salaries.Contributing to the debate on the national budget, Hwende directly addressed the issue of legislator welfare.

The move and subsequent comments from US politicians have put AfriForum at the eye of the diplomatic storm.Kriel: We never used that terminologySpeaking to broadcaster Newzroom Afrika on Saturday, Kriel insisted AfriForum had never described the situation in South Africa as a genocide targeting Afrikaners.That is another lie spread by the ANC. The fact is, those media institutions that accused us of spreading the white genocide narrative, we took them to the Press Ombud and already five of those institutions had to apologise to us. We never used that terminology.Our stance is quite clear, the Kill the Boer, Kill the farmer chant, calling for the killing of Afrikaners on an ethnic basis, is a genocidal call. But we never said there is genocide. All we are asking from the government and the president is  condemn this call, acknowledge the fact that we are seeing tortures that accompany these murders, and declare it a priority crime, he said.Kriel said when his organisation visited the United States, AfriForum understood the consequences of concerns which had been raised repeatedly in Washington about the situation in South Africa.We knew exactly what the consequences would be if those issues were not addressed. That is why we went to the US after that post (by Trump) and made a plea to the US administration not to punish the country for the irresponsible behaviour of the ANC. The fact is, and people are falling for this, they dont want to take responsibility for the consequences of their own negative behaviour. They now need a scapegoat, he said.If you go and have a look, long before we went to the US, in the House of Representatives, a Bill was asking for the review of the relationship with South Africa.

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nTHE government has pledged more land to the Urban Development Corporation (UDCORP) after the parastatal completed a successful, profitable transformation strategy.\n\nDuring a tour of Knockmallock Mixed Housing Project in Chegutu last FrIday, stakeholders had the opportunity to ask questions and get full details of the project, which will benefit both the low-income earners, middle class and the bourgeoisie.\n\nThe project, under a developmental initiative partnering Chegutu Rural District Council, UDCORPs Knockmallock Mixed Housing Project is a self-contained project with residential stands, commercial stands, a light industrial park, and institutional stands such as schools, churches, cemetery and others.\n\nLocal Government Minister, Daniel Garwe, in a speech read on his behalf by the Chief Director of Spatial Planning and Development in the ministry, Shingirayi Mushamba said UDCORP is strategically positioned to play a leading role in the governments Call to Action  No Compromise to Service Delivery.\n\nMushamba confirmed that the ministry would allocate more land to UDCORP to empower its national development role.\n\nUDCORP Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Joy Shumbamhini, addressing stakeholders, said the transformation journey began on April 7, 2023, when the UDCORP board approved a very ambitious transformation strategy to turn around its fortunes.\n\nUDCORPs brand had gone bad and was associated with bad things, but we have invited you today to witness a new UDCORP.\n\nToday I stand before you to reflect a profound strategic journey of transformation, resilience, and tangible progress, because we are talking in the office where we are doing this project, and we wanted you to come and see for yourself the work that is being done in the creation of a new setup, Shumbamhini said.\n\nIn 2023, UDCORP launched a transformation journey, naming it Transformation Restore UDCORP Prosperity.\n\nOur first part of the transformation journey was to put our house in order, and amongst our 10 objectives was to turn around UDCORP from a loss-making to a profit-making organisation.\n\nThe corporation was making losses for years, and it was not sustainable. The second objective was to mobilise resources from the private sector, local and regional financial institutions. The third objective is to unlock the UDCORP land bank and resuscitate project works, Shumbamhini added.\n\nHe said UDCORP was currently working on creating effective and efficient internal governance systems, policies, processes, procedures in administration systems and also in the process of reviewing the UDCORP business model and implementation of the new business model.\n\nThe parastatal managed to clear its backlog in terms of annual general meetings.The corporation had gone for a number of years without presenting annual audited financial statements to stakeholders.\n\nWe have cleared the backlog in audited financial statements and annual general meetings dating as far back as 2020. And the corporation is now up to date. Our corporate governance compliance is sold to 96%.\n\nThe parastatal also managed to reduce the project costs by at least USD$8 million from US$40 million to USD$22 million.\n\nUDCORP has another project in Manresa, a block of high-rise flats, where four blocks were constructed and now transferred to the National Housing ministry for completion at the allocation to civil servants.\n\nUnfortunately, the Manresa project stalled as UDCORPs capital was wiped out due to currency changes and inflation.\n\nWe successfully resuscitated the Knockmallock Housing Project in July 2024. This was not a simple task. It required strategic focus and diligence.\n\nToday, we celebrate the successful resuscitation of a flexion housing project, the Knockmallock Mixed Housing Project. This project falls under the Chegutu Rural District Council. And this is clear testimony that real artistic councils can also embrace rapid modernisation.\n\nAccording to Shumbamhini, phase one of the project is almost 90% complete, with 608 high-density residential stands.\n\nPhase one, extension, because we have realized that there is a huge demand for high-density stands, so we have to create additional extension for high-density, which is going to yield 1,263 high-density residential stands.\n\nPhase two is medium-density stands, which are going to yield 881 residential stands. Phase three is your low-density stands, that area of the mountain, the mountainous area, low-density stands with a beautiful scenery, and we are going to have about 398 low-density stands, said the CEO.\n\nThe project is self-funding with the resources that are being used to implement this project coming from individuals, corporates, and institutional investors such as pension funds\n\nWe are calling upon companies, pension funds, and institutional investors to approach UDCORP for public-private partnerships or commercial joint ventures in housing and infrastructure development.\n\nWe call upon rural district councils to emulate Chegutu RDC in undertaking such game-changing housing projects, said Shumbamhini.\n\nFully paid-up clients can immediately qualify to start applying for title deeds, giving them security of tenure.\n\nWe have already started the process of all fully paid-up members with check to load disposal and we appreciate check to load disposal for the work that theyre doing to assist our fully paid-up members.\n\nIn terms of progress on the ground, We can confirm that we have covered significant ground in doing sewer reticulation, water reticulation, and stormwater drains. The road servicing will be done soon after we finish our sewer and our water, and we want to make sure that we complete phase one by December 31, 2025.\n\nFor sewer treatment, the corporation has adopted a biodigester system. The tender for biodigesters has just been concluded, and the contractor is expected to commence project works in December 2025. And going forward, we are strengthening our research and development function in order for the corporation to become a pioneer in innovation and modern technologies in the built environment.\n\nUDCORPs focus is on social impact, making sure its pricing will be very reasonable and far lower than the private sector.\n\n",

Mvududu had argued that his termination was unlawful because it was effected without a disciplinary hearing and that the parastatal had no authority to dismiss him.\n\nMy termination was executed without following the established procedures, which violates not just my employment rights, but fundamental rights that should be protected under our Constitution, he submitted in his appeal.\n\nDelivering the judgment, Justice Susan Mavangira said the matter had already been conclusively determined.\n\nThe applicants legal maneuvers appear aimed at rehashing a matter that has been thoroughly adjudicated upon.The Supreme Court has already ruled on the basis of his employment relationship, and his attempts to reassert his claims lack merit.Mvududus latest application for condonation and an extension of time to file further appeals was dismissed on the grounds that it lacked legal merit. The court ruled that the arguments advanced were a clear attempt to sidestep the Supreme Courts definitive judgments, which have laid to rest the issues in question.Mvududu maintained that only the Minister of Agriculture, not ARDA, had authority over his employment.It is the Minister, not ARDA, that governs these employment issues.However, the court said earlier rulings, including one by Justice Bharat Patel had settled the dispute, finding no basis for reopening the matter.The judgment marks the conclusion of a legal fight spanning more than a decade.\n\nThe applicants legal maneuvers appear aimed at rehashing a matter that has been thoroughly adjudicated upon.\n\nThe Supreme Court has already ruled on the basis of his employment relationship, and his attempts to reassert his claims lack merit.\n\nMvududus latest application for condonation and an extension of time to file further appeals was dismissed on the grounds that it lacked legal merit.
