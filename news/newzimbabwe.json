His defining moment came on the stroke of half-time, as he contributed to two crucial stops within 10 yards of the end zone, as well as another earlier tackle in the same drive which saw the Rams held up over the course of eight plays.\n\nAt the time, the scores were deadlocked at 3-3. The Rams defense, led by Landman, prevented the Ravens from taking control at a crucial point in the game. In the third quarter, the Rams themselves took charge and never looked back.\n\nWhat a stop by our guys, really buckling up there,Landman told Tom Bradyfor Fox Sports after the legendary quarterback selected him as his LFG Player of the Game. Thats the pride of the defense right there, how you play goal line, and we rose up to the occasion. Way to set the tone for the rest of the game.\n\nSmith-Njigba, who has ties to Sierra Leone through his grandfather, is on a run where everything he touches turns to gold  and much of what he touches turns to touchdowns.\n\nThe wide receiver scored a 61-yard touchdown in the Seattle Seahawks 20-12 win over theJacksonville Jaguars. It came at a crucial time, too, as the Seahawks had been 6-3 behind midway through the second quarter before he crept in behind the defense and latched onto aSam Darnoldpass.\n\nAlthough Landman walks away with Africas MVP honors this week as far as we are concerned, Smith-Njigba is the most likely candidate from the continent to be in the running for NFL MVP a the end of the season.\n\nSmith-Njigba made a total of eight catches for 162 yards. Although there were many other moments worth celebrating from players with ties to Africa in week 6  notably a hugely impressive 72-yard kick return fromKene Nwangwu(ties to Nigeria) in theNew York Jets defeat to theDenver Broncos there was ultimately nobody who could top Smith-Njigba in terms of a notable single play.\n\nHonorable mentions\n\nUchenna Nwosu who has family ties to Nigeria  got 1.5 sacks for the Seahawks in their win over the Jaguars.\n\nNigeria-born duoDavid OnyemataandRuke Orhorhoroeach picked up a sack as theAtlanta Falconsupset theBuffalo Bills24-14.Charles Omenihu who has ties to Nigeria through his parents  got one for theKansas City Chiefsas they gained a crucial 30-17 win over theDetroit Lions.\n\nEyioma Uwazurike who also has parental ties to Nigeria  made a sack for the Denver Broncos in their narrow win over the New York Jets.\n\nOdafe Oweh raised in a Nigerian household in New Jersey  also had a memorable Sunday as he got a sack on debut for theLos Angeles Chargersin their 29-27 win over theMiami Dolphins. Oweh was recently traded from the Baltimore Ravens.\n\nWeek 6 was one to remember for African-born players, with few if any that can compare in recent memory. Landman (born in Zimbabwe), Onyemata, Orhorhoro (both born in Nigeria) and Paye (born in Guinea) all had performances to remember.\n\nThere was a crucial development off the field, too, as Nigerian International Player Pathway (IPP) Program standout Basil Chijioke CJ Okoye was officially signed to the Baltimore Ravens active roster from their practice squad shortly before his third straight NFL regular season appearance.\n\nOkoye and the Ravens may have ended up on the losing side against Landmans Rams, but he  just as much as the Zimbabwean  will remember the weekend for years to come.\n\n",

The bottles of medication were found on the accident scene, a few kilometres outside Makhado.\n\nThe inquiry comes as police explore potential contraventions of the countrys drug laws. According to the SAPS statement, Section 22A of the Medicines and Related Substances Act in South Africa makes it a crime to possess certain scheduled medicines without proper authorization.\n\nProvincial commissioner of police in Limpopo, Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe. Image: SAPS\n\nLegally, someone is only permitted to possess and carry the quantity of medicine you have been prescribed by an authorized prescriber. Carrying a large quantity of medicine without exception is illegal, provincial police spokesperson, Colonel Malesela Ledwaba said.\n\nWhile the lawful owner of the medication has not yet been identified, police are treating the find seriously as their investigation into the cause of the fatal crash continues.\n\nThe tragedy occurred on Sunday, October 13, when a cross-border bus, reportedly travelling from Gqeberha to Zimbabwe and Malawi, veered off the mountainous road on the N1 and plunged down an embankment. The death toll rose to 43, with scores of other passengers injured.\n\nAlthough for now the lawful owner of the bottles of medication is not yet identified to get the explanation regarding its origin, the police have, in the meantime, opened an inquiry for further investigation, said Ledwaba.\n\nAnyone or the lawful owner of the medication is requested to contact the nearest police, call the SAPS toll-free number 08600 10111 or use the My SAPS App.\n\nVisuals seen on television news channels showed bottles of what appears to be BronCleer spewed among the luggage at the crash scene. The images and videos have sparked outrage, with many social media users accusing foreign nationals of looting South Africas health system.\n\nOn Tuesday,IOL reported that health authorities have moved to quash viral social media claims that South Africas public healthcare system is distributing BronCleer, a codeine-based cough syrup, insisting the medication is strictly controlled and only available through private or illegal channels.\n\nThe clarification comes amid a police bust in Kimberley that uncovered a stash of unregistered medicines  including BronCleer  being sold unlawfully by unlicensed operators.\n\nCity of Tshwanes MMC for Health Services, Tshegofatso Mashabela, has dismissed claims circulating on social media about public healthcare facilities in South Africa distributing BronCleer, a codeine-based cough syrup.\n\nMashabela clarified that BronCleer is a controlled substance and not included in the official formularies or procurement lists of any government hospitals or clinics.\n\n",

This prompted the ZWPSL, led by chairperson Chido Chizondo, to request written confirmation of Magayas support and proof that funds had been deposited into the clubs account.\n\nDespite reportedly meeting these conditions, the league remained silent, later indicating that the matter had been referred to the ZIFA national board.\n\nThe saga came to an end on Wednesday morning when Maningi Queens announced that their bid for readmission had been officially rejected.\n\nWe would want to announce that MYSA has now been formally dismissed from the ZWPSL following our request to rejoin, despite finding a big sponsor willing to help us now and in the following seasons.\n\nIt is a very sad day for womens football as the livelihoods of many young players, support personnel, and the technical team are at immediate risk. Moreover, this situation could seriously derail the momentum of womens football development in the country at a time when there is a national push towards grassroots football, girl-child mass participation, and rebuilding Zimbabwean football, read part of the Maningi Queens statement.\n\nThe club further criticised what it described as unprofessional conduct by some womens football administrators in handling their case.\n\nIt is also very worrying how constitution violations have become a disturbing habit among some individuals entrusted with leadership positions in womens football across the country. This continues to highlight a growing culture in which personal interests and unilateral decision-making overshadow the principles of accountability, transparency, and fairness.\n\nWe are stronger together and we hope that one day ZIFA will roll out urgent reforms and stronger oversight mechanisms to protect our loved sport and the vulnerable.\n\n",

There can be no other conclusion which can be sustained on the facts of this case other than that the accused intentionally caused the death of the deceased.\n\nAccording to the court record, the fatal incident occurred on January 1, 2025, when both men were drinking beer at Old Pumula Shopping Centre in Bulawayo.\n\nWitnesses testified that after being struck with a plastic chair by the deceased during a confrontation, Mlotshwa pulled out a knife from his person and stabbed Mjaho once in the abdomen before fleeing the scene.\n\nMjaho later died in the hospital. The post-mortem report listed the cause of death as haemorrhagic shock, abdominal visceral injury, and callous stabbing.\n\nMlotshwa denied intending to kill, claiming the deceased was the aggressor who attacked him first and that the stabbing occurred accidentally as he tried to disarm Mjaho.\n\nBut the court dismissed his version as difficult to comprehend and inconsistent with the eyewitness accounts.\n\nThe witnesses observed the accused taking out the knife and stabbing the deceased before running away, the judge said. It was in the morning and visibility was very good such that the witnesses could not have been mistaken on what they saw.\n\nNduna said the nature and depth of the stab wound, and the fact that it was aimed at a vital organ, proved intent.\n\nIn pursuance of the assault, one stab wound was inflicted  the degree of force and depth of the wound was severe, he ruled. The accused deliberately aimed at that part of the body and fled the scene upon landing the knife. That shows his intention to achieve the death of the deceased.\n\nThe judge noted that Mlotshwa could not claim drunkenness as mitigation because the murder occurred early in the morning and there was no evidence he was intoxicated.\n\nIn imposing a 23-year prison term, Nduna said the crime was aggravated by the use of a weapon and by the fact that the victim was a young father of two.\n\nThe deceased had a wife and children who are now without a father, the judge said. There is nothing in the commission of the offence which invites the court to mercy. The accused was armed and ready to use the knife.\n\nWhile emphasising that punishment must be fair and just instead of savage or draconian, the judge said mercy could not outweigh the gravity of taking another life.\n\nIt must not be lost that another human being was killed, Nduna said. There, a sentence of 25 years would have been fair, but for the mitigation outlined above, 23 years imprisonment is just.\n\nThe murder weapon was forfeited to the State for destruction.\n\n",

A considerable amount of resources was invested to guarantee its success. It is unlikely that an operation of this scale could have achieved its goals without substantial financial support.\n\nFor the record Mr Kudakwashe Tagwirei put in a total of 5 million litres of fuel, food and other provisions for soldiers as requested by the then CDF, General Chiwenga. Furthermore, he put in one million litres of fuel and US$1.6 million to the Party.\n\nTherefore, the success of Operation Restore Legacy cannot be attributed to a few individuals. Any such assertions are aimed at distorting the historical narrative for personal and political gain, said Ziyambi.\n\nTagwirei, who is a benefactor of ZANU PF, has recently been accused of using his proximity to President Emmerson Mnangagwa to acquire government tenders.\n\nThe controversial entrepreneur has also been the subject of attacks by former ZANU PF member and fugitive Blessed Geza, who has accused him of capturing the state and perpetuating corruption.\n\nTagwirei has remained mum on the allegations of corruption.\n\nZiyambi said the removal of Mugabe was a collective effort, warning a clique backing Chiwenga to desist from claiming heroism.\n\nIt is denied that only a few individuals, particularly the writers of this document, sacrificed their lives for the attainment of Operation Restore Legacy. Zimbabweans from all walks of life rose and participated in and supported Operation Restore Legacy.\n\nLet us acknowledge the collective effort that made Operation Restore Legacy possible and desist from claiming heroism for work done by many, said Ziyambi.\n\n",

            "content": "AP\n\nInside a white tent with a wooden fireplace in the middle, about two dozen African girls slipped off their shoes, sat on mattresses and prepared to pour their hearts out.\n\nThey held hands and their chants of its so nice to be here echoed through the tent before they set about discussing sexuality, child marriage, teen pregnancy, gender bias, education, economic empowerment and the law. Nothing was off limits.\n\nThe girls hangout in rural northeasternZimbabweis a revival of Nhanga, the local term for girls bedroom, an ancient traditional space once used to prepare adolescent girls for marriage. Across rural Zimbabwe, girls are now reinventing the centuries-old practice as a peer-led movement to resist child marriage, which is rife in the southern African nation.\n\nThis is a safe space, every girl feels free, said 18-year-old Anita Razo, who joined at 14 and now mentors younger girls.\n\nIn traditional homesteads, a round thatched hut served as Nhanga, a female-only room where girls were taught obedience, how to please husbands and moral education. It reinforced patriarchal expectations.\n\nToday, the practice is being flipped. The new Nhanga is a cultural innovation dealing with modern problems, and where girls candidly tackle subjects still sensitive in many conservative homes, said Nokutenda Magama, a programs officer with Rozaria Memorial Trust, a nonprofit that works to empower rural girls and women and is behind the Nhanga revival.\n\nSessions include practical skills like poultry raising, farming and soap making.\n\nThe trust organizes gatherings by age group, from girls as young as five to women over 35, ensuring an age-appropriate curriculum and mentorship across generations. Elders, including senior government officials, are sometimes invited.\n\nThe reinvention comes against worrying statistics. One in three girls in Zimbabwe marries before 18, according to the United Nations Childrens Fund, calling it a national emergency demanding urgent action. Its a similar situation across East and southern Africa. Child marriage rates soar to above 40% in central and West Africa, with Niger, at 76%, the highest globally, according to UNICEF.\n\nZimbabwe and many other African countrieshave outlawed child marriage, evenoverturning laws prohibiting abortion for girls under 18, but poverty, lethargic enforcement and cultural and religious customs keep it alive.\n\nFor Samantha Chidodo, the revival offered a path back. Now 26 and a final-year law student, she was forced into an abusive marriage at 17 to a man nearly a decade older.\n\nAll I wanted was to play and think of my future. Suddenly I had to be a mother and wife, she said at a camp that blended tent sessions with a girls and goals soccer tournament.\n\nI didnt even know what to do. I would be dead asleep, oblivious that I needed to breastfeed. A woman next door would take the crying baby, feed him and return him to the sleeping teen mother, she recalled.\n\nAfter two years, she walked away, enduring stigma as neighbors warned others not to associate with her. With support from Rozaria Memorial Trust, she returned to school and became one of the modern Nhanga pioneers.\n\nInitially we were only about 20 girls. Almost 90% of us did well, some went to college, others started projects. The community began to see our power, and encouraged their children to join, she said. Nhanga is now seen as cool.\n\nToday, more than 200 girls in her village participate. Many schools across Zimbabwe have adopted the model, which has spread to Zambia and Sierra Leone and reached African Union and United Nations forums.\n\nBecause child marriage is often rooted in culture and religion, girls sought the backing of chiefs and village heads  custodians of local customs.\n\nXmas Savanhu, a local village headman, said leaders now enforce rules against early marriage. Offenders must pay a cow as a fine held in trust by the chief for the girls education. This ensures she can return to school without financial worries, he said, noting that culprits are also reported to police. Chiefs also partner with NGOs to help young mothers resume their studies.\n\nDespite progress, poverty and entrenched attitudes persist, said Enet Tini, a teacher and girls mentor whose school adopted the model.\n\nShe welcomeda government policy allowing girls to return to school after giving birth, but noted parents are often reluctant. The gap that we have lies with the adults. They view pregnancy or child marriage as indiscipline so they think the girls should be punished, she said, highlighting the importance of girls-ledinitiatives to change attitudes among themselvesand the community.\n\nNyaradzai Gumbonzvanda, deputy executive director at U.N. Women and founder of the Rozaria Memorial Trust, called child marriage essentially rape and sexual exploitation and a worldwide problem, but much higher in Africa, where laws alone cannot end it.\n\nLaws are important  but it is critically essential to reach to the girls themselves, to do the shift in the social norms in our communities, said Gumbonzvanda, who started Rozaria Memorial Trust in 2007 in honor of her late mother, who was married at 13.\n\nHer message that solutions must involve girls themselves alongside policymakers and traditional leaders resonates with Razo, the young mentor.\n\nIf we can pressure each other into behaving badly, then we can also influence each other to act positively, Razo said.\n\n",
