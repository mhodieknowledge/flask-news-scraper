            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nCongolese refugee and businessman Desire Nsengimana has lodged a formal complaint with the Zimbabwe Independent Complaints Commission (ZICC), accusing State security and immigration officials of harassment and unlawful detention amid intensifying tuckshop wars in downtown Harare.\n\nIn a letter by his lawyers, Rubaya and Chatambudza Legal Practitioners, gleaned by NewZimbabwe.com, Nsengimana alleges that members of the security sector are working with rival foreign traders who are weaponising gossip to eliminate competition through deportations and arrests.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Nsengimana has been held at Harare Remand Prison since June after he was allegedly kidnapped by men claiming to be Central Intelligence Organisation (CIO) agents.\n\nHe says the agents branded him an enemy of the State and falsely accused him of being part of Rwandas National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS).\n\nOn or about the 10th of June 2025, our client was kidnapped by a contingent of individuals who he claims presented themselves as members of the Central Intelligence Organisation, whom, if given the chance, he is capable of identifying, reads part of the letter dated November 7 and addressed to the ZICC Executive Secretary.\n\nHis captors communicated the spurious allegations against him. They threatened and ordered him to leave Zimbabwe, having been falsely branded an enemy of the State.\n\nThe letter adds: This designation was based on the unsubstantiated claim that he is an operative of Rwandas National Intelligence and Security Service (NISS), allegedly deployed to target Rwandan refugees who settled in Zimbabwe post 1994.\n\nNsengimana insists he is a legitimate refugee from the Democratic Republic of Congo, lawfully residing in Zimbabwe since 2014, and has no links to Rwandan intelligence.\n\nHe alleges that he told the alleged CIO agents that certain Rwandan refugees who settled in Zimbabwe just after the 1994 Rwandan genocide were the ones who were just seeing shadows and were on a frolic of their own, giving the security agents in Zimbabwe false information for purposes of weeding out of Zimbabwe other refugees like Desire Nsengimana who they regarded as threats in business circles, the letter states.\n\nHis lawyers further argue that there was nothing to the allegations as it was a simple case of jealousy and rivalry wherein his detractors sought and still seek to equate his business acumen with state sponsorship.\n\nFollowing the alleged abduction, Nsengimana was reportedly handed over to Immigration Compliance Officer Machona, who ordered him to report to the Immigration Department the following day.\n\nSubsequent to his kidnapping, he was then handed over to one Immigration Compliance Officer Machona who then instructed him to visit the Immigration Department Offices the next day, the 11th of June 2025. He was then advised by Machona that he was going to be detained at Harare Remand Prison as a prohibited person for deportation to Rwanda, the lawyers said.\n\nThe letter further claims that Machona advised him that his arrest and subsequent detention was not up to the Immigration Department, but some powerful members of the Central Intelligence Organisation connected to a clique of refugees from Rwanda. Mr. Nsengimana was perplexed by such abuse of State apparatus in the name of State Security, yet he is not even a danger to the Republic of Zimbabwe.\n\nNsengimana is now appealing to the ZICC to investigate the alleged abuse of authority by State and immigration officials, which he believes is being driven by jealousy and commercial rivalry among refugee business operators in Harare.\n\n",

Its not the place to seek financial reward or make a living if thats what youre after.\n\nIf you want a well-paid job or to make sensible money, then pursue a proper career wholeheartedly. What youll find is that if you have a solid career, youll make what you earn monthly from being in Parliament in less than an hour, said Mahere.\n\nThis is not the first time that the MPs have raised eyebrows over loan facilities.\n\nIn 2023, MPs received US$40,000 loans from the government as part of their benefits, a move that was widely condemned by civic groups.\n\nCritics have also questioned the timing of Hwendes remarks, coming as Zanu PF pushes for constitutional amendments to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas tenure, a process that will require parliamentary approval.\n\nIn response to the backlash, Hwende defended his comments, insisting that he was merely pointing out an existing precedent.\n\nThe uncomfortable truth is that everyone who has been an MP since 2000 for the opposition and ruling party has received cars, stands, loans, medical aid, salaries, bonuses and some even got cars from (former RBZ governor) Gono outside parliament, but they are your favourites you will pretend like you dont know, said Hwende.\n\n",

Sikhala is not a foolish man who would knowingly carry explosives, which are illegal. If he ever had such intentions, he could have used someone else. This was clearly a planned operation, said Ndawana.\n\nHe alleged that Zanu PF, which is well-resourced and has access to powerful intelligence systems, could easily execute cross-border operations, not just in South Africa but anywhere in the world.\n\nNdawana further claimed that the alleged plot was meant to link Sikhala to the recent arson attack on the SAPES Trust building in Harare.\n\nThis was a calculated move to connect him to the bombings back home, to create the impression that Sikhala was behind them. They wanted to substantiate that false narrative, which is why the explosives were planted in his car, he said.\n\nHe added that the move was also intended to silence Sikhala, a fierce critic of Zanu PF and its Agenda 2030.\n\nHowever, Zanu PF Information Director Farai Marapira rubbished the allegations as baseless.\n\nThe fact of the matter is that this is the usual behaviour from the Zimbabwean opposition, said Marapira.\n\nThey commit crimes and then try to sensationalise them politically to cover themselves. But as always, the law is clear,it will deal with anyone who breaks it.\n\n",
