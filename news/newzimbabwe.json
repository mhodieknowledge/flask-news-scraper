            "content": "By Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThis story was originally published byGlobal Press Journal\n\nIts been months since lecturers at the University of Zimbabwe, the countrys oldest and most prestigious university, stepped aside. Their salaries, eroded by inflation and currency devaluation, could no longer cover their basic needs, they said.\n\nThat was in April, and theres no sign yet that theyll return to their lecture halls.\n\nWe have been betrayed and no longer have passion for our work, says J.T., a lecturer who has taught at the university for more than 10 years. He asked to be identified only by his initials for fear of retaliation from the institution.\n\nThe indefinite strike has left thousands of students struggling. Many are trying to study on their own but are uncertain if their lecturers will ever return to work.\n\nThe University of Zimbabwes registrars office did not respond to a Global Press Journal request for comment. But in May, the office issued a statement saying the issues lecturers had raised were legitimate and the university is working with the government to address them.\n\nHowever, Obvious Vengeyi, a professor and spokesperson for the Association of University Teachers, says that in June, the university dismissed him and three other executive members of the association. All had been leading the strike. The university, he says, has also hired adjunct lecturers to fill the gap left by striking lecturers, and some contract lecturers have returned to work.\n\nNarshon Kohlo, chairperson of the Zimbabwe National Students Union at the University of Zimbabwe, says this is only a stopgap measure  one thats failing students.\n\nSome of them are just recent graduates, he says, adding that they lack experience to adequately fill the gap. Students who began the semester with their regular lecturers have been left without continuity, and not all have been assigned replacements.\n\nProblems extend beyond the university. The countrys struggling economy has hollowed out many of its institutions. Hospitals face worryingshortages of medicine and staff.Primary and secondary schoolsstruggle to retain teachers. And that sectors higher education system, once a model on the continent, is now losing its footing.\n\nYears of hyperinflation, currency instability and dwindling government support have stripped the institutions of resources, slashed salaries and driven professionals out of the country. Experts worry about the long-term damage this might cause a country already grappling with economic collapse.\n\nIf you destroy the education system, you have destroyed the foundation for a viable and sustainable economic system, says Eldred Masunungure, a political scientist.\n\nTinotenda Kahenga, left, studies with classmates at the University of Zimbabwe.

It was heavily subsidized by the government with minor support from donors. Around this time, the government also provided grants to university students.\n\nSoon after independence, the country had the highest-educated workforce and one of the highest literacy rates in southern Africa.\n\nDemand for education grew rapidly. Then-President Robert Mugabes government began implementing an ambitious program in 1996: to build a university in every province in an effort to address colonial inequalities and expand access to higher education.\n\nBut the government lacked resources to fully fund all the universities.\n\nIn the 1990s, supported by the World Bank and other multilateral institutions, Zimbabwe adopted the second part of an economic adjustment program. The government slashed spending on public universities and stopped student grants to state institutions.\n\nBy 2001, the government had introduced fees in post-secondary institutions to help cover costs.\n\nOver time, Zimbabwes economic fortunes have worsened, further weakening the governments ability to support its 13 state universities. In the last decade, the government has slashed the higher education budget, with its share of total government spending falling by more than half, from 6.9% in 2016 to 3.2% in 2025.\n\nOnce a leading academic institution on the continent, the University of Zimbabwe now faces widespread disruption as faculty protest salaries that no longer cover basic living costs. Credit: Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nA shaky currency\n\nAn unstable currency system and other economic shocks have made it difficult for public institutions that depend on government funding to function effectively, says Godfrey Kanyenze, founding director of the Labour and Economic Development Research Institute of Zimbabwe.\n\nThe country, he says, has been trapped in a loop of economic instability since the Zimbabwean dollar crashed in 1997 and again in 2008.\n\nWhile there was some stability between 2009 and 2013 after the government introduced a multi-currency system, 2018 was a major turning point. That year, the governmentreplaced United States dollars with a new local currency, claiming it was equal in value to the US dollar. However, the local currency quickly collapsed, wiping out peoples savings, driving prices up more than fivefold and shattering public trust in the banking system.\n\nLike many workers in the public sector, lecturers were severely affected, and they say they have never recovered. Vengeyi says that this 2018 move slashed the value of lecturers salaries by nearly 90%, from US$2,250 per month to US$230 per month.\n\nThe country has experienced several currency changes since, but the local currencys value against the US dollar has continued to erode. By end of March 2024, the exchange rate had fallen so far that one US dollar was equivalent to nearly 20,000 Zimbabwean dollars. The next month in an attempt to stabilize the situation, the governmentissued yet another new currency dubbed Zimbabwean gold  which is backed in part by the governments gold reserves. But the value has halved since then,and people mostly use (and prefer) the US dollar.\n\nThe government has tried to help civil servants cushion these economic shocks, but lecturers say the fixes havent helped. In January 2020, the government introduced an allowance to civil servants paid in local currency, ranging from 400 Zimbabwean dollars to 800 Zimbabwean dollars per month.\n\nThen in June that same year, the government introduced a US$75 monthly allowance. By 2023, the allowances reached about US$300 per month.\n\nThese allowances were not subject to tax. However, in 2024, the government folded these allowances into regular salaries, meaning theyd be taxed, further reducing employees income.\n\nA University of Zimbabwe lecturer writes a placard during a protest outside the campus. Experts say deteriorating salaries and working conditions are undermining not just faculty livelihoods but the countrys higher education system. Credit: Gamuchirai Masiyiwa, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThe ongoing strike at the University of Zimbabwe is just one example of the accumulated frustrations across the countrys universities over the crumbling economy.\n\nWhat many lecturers earn now can barely sustain a basic life, sapping their motivation, Vengeyi says. This in turn, he says, affects the quality of teaching and research.\n\nAlthough Zimbabwe maintains a high research output in sub-Saharan Africa, after South Africa and Kenya, the quality and impact is low, according to a 2020 World Bank report.\n\nWithout institutional, financial and other support mechanisms, the [educational] product is defective, Vengeyi says. What quality can come from someone whose children cannot afford health care, food, clothes, education?\n\nSome lecturers have turned to side jobs to make ends meet. Some even sell a variety of goods on campus. Women use their handbags as tuckshops, Vengeyi says. Some sell vegetables, tomatoes, perfumes and the like.\n\nJ.T. says the chicken-rearing projects and other small businesses he invested in back when he earned well have been sustaining him.\n\nOthers are leaving, Kanyenze says.\n\nAccurate data is hard to come by, but anecdotal evidence suggests that,much like in the health caresector, professionals in the education sector are leaving for better opportunities abroad.\n\nVengeyi says since 2018, when salaries plummeted, most departments at the University of Zimbabwe have lost at least five senior lecturers. In J.T.s department, 10 out of 18 lecturers have left for opportunities abroad.\n\nIt is a huge loss to the country, Vengeyi says. It is Zimbabwe that spends resources training citizens, but other nations benefit without spending anything.\n\nTo maintain its manpower, policymakers need to budget appropriately for all institutions of higher learning so they do not decay, Masunungure says. The decay of such institutions will inevitably result in the decay of the economy and the whole national ecosystem.\n\nDuring a protest outside the University of Zimbabwe, professor Obvious Vengeyi, spokesperson for the Association of University Teachers, holds a placard reading Aluta continua  Portuguese for The Struggle Continues  a slogan from Mozambiques liberation struggle, now widely used across Africa to signal ongoing resistance.

This is very tough and stressful for me. Like others among thousands of students enrolled at the university, he has spent weeks studying alone or with classmates.\n\nBut Kohlo, the chairperson of the Zimbabwe National Students Union at the University of Zimbabwe, doesnt blame lecturers for leaving students adrift.\n\nThey have a right to fight for fair salaries, not the slave wages they are currently getting, he says, adding that its the university thats responsible for providing students with education in return for the exorbitant amounts of fees that they charge.\n\nMeanwhile, the student body has written to the administration several times about the disruption the strike is causing and has held peaceful protests of their own, Kohlo says. The response? He and six other students were arrested and charged with disorderly conduct, though they were released later that day.\n\nGamuchirai Masiyiwais a Reporter-in-Residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.

Proposedmeasures includeformalizing a national ideology, establishing a national institute of ideology andintegrating patrioticeducation into the curriculum.\n\nThe motion comes on top ofthe contested Patriotic Act of 2023, which was seen toeffectively closed the door on dissent In Zimbabwe. It makes provision forcriticism issues such as provision of health care, basic services and accountability to be judged criminal.\n\nThe government dismissed criticism, saying the legislation was necessary to hold accountable individuals who threaten national interests. It said the legislation was modeled on the Logan Act in the US, which bars citizens from engaging in certain unauthorized communications with foreign governments. In Zimbabwe, violations could result in life imprisonment and death, termination of citizenship, suspension from voting or holding public office.\n\nIn a recent parliamentary debate, ZANU-PF MP Ophious Murambiwa suggested that it should be criminal to speak evilabout Zimbabwe.\n\nThe most important issue is to love our country, let us praise our country in all circumstances, whether in good or bad times, during the night or day, Murambiwa said.\n\nThe motion has prompted opposition lawmakers and human rights groups to pushback harder.\n\nPatriotism is not blind loyalty. It is not empty slogans. True patriots question injustice, challenge corruption and demand systems that serve people not a selected few, Prosper Mutseyami, an opposition MP, said.\n\nOur patriotism must ignite participation, ensuring that every Zimbabwean plays an active role in shaping the future.\n\nHuman rights activists say its another attempt to silence dissent.\n\nYou cannot necessarily legislate patriotism, Nigel Nyamutumbu, the Media Alliance of Zimbabwe programs manager, told DW. It is a concept that can naturally clamp down on the requisite freedoms. Patriotism is not a legal concept but rather a political nationalist ideology.\n\nActivists have in the past been accused of treason and unpatriotic behavior for expressing concerns over human rights abuses, corruption, and governance in Zimbabwe.\n\nCitizens have expressed concern overwhat they fear are attempts to enforce a one-party state. ZANU-PF, with its absolute majority in parliament, is seen to be abusing its authority and violating the constitution.\n\nAs parliamentarians we are supposed to uphold the constitution, Gladys Hlatshwayo an opposition MP told DW. Section 119 of the constitution demands that parliament protects the constitution and democratic governance.\n\nIn June 2025, Zimbabwes High Court struck down sections of the Patriotic Act.The court ruled that the drastic penalties prescribed by the Patriotic Act infringed on various sections of the countrys constitution.\n\nSeveral civic organizations and a private citizens had petitioned the court, arguing thatthe legislation was overly broad and vague and had high potential for abuse and misuse.\n\nThe most patriotic people are those who hold their government to account. A government must not be seen as the most dangerous institution, Eric Chisora, a political analyst, told DW. Whatever they [ZANU-PF lawmakers] are doing is unreasonable and irrational. Citizens rights must be protected.\n\nPolitical and civic rights activistsare calling for the repeal of colonial legacy laws which they say are retrogressive. Laws such as the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act, with provisions have been used to incriminate government critics, date back toZimbabwes pre-independence erawhen they were used to suppress Black majority rule.\n\nThe activists are concerned over the shrinking of democratic space under Emmerson Mnangagwa, Zimbabwes president since 2018.\n\nWe are now living in a country where there is no freedom of expression due to the number of pieces of legislation being passed by the ZANU-PF regime, Blessing Vava, executive director of the Crisis in Zimbabwe Coalition, told DW.\n\nWhen you see a government passing repressive laws, just know that it is not a popular government. Zimbabweans must fight to defend the constitution.\n\n",
