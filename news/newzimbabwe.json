            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE streets of Leeds in the United Kingdom (UK) roared with the sound of resistance this Saturday as Zimbabwean nationals and solidarity groups marched 15 kilometres through the city in a protest against tyranny by President Emmerson Mnangagwa back home.\n\nOrganised by the Zimbabwe Human Rights Organisation (ZHRO), the demonstrations went ahead undeterred by recent threats from Mnangagwas government, with participants singing revolutionary songs and chanting calls for democratic change, standing defiant in the face of intimidation.\n\nThe walk came in the wake of chilling warnings from Zimbabwean authorities, who have vowed to apply the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Amendment Act (2023) against anyoneinside or outside Zimbabwewho tarnishes the image of the so-called Second Republic. Despite this, participants in Leeds said they would not be silenced.\n\nWe are not afraid, said one marcher.\n\nWe will continue to speak out against corruption, nepotism, and oppression.\n\nThe Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) recently confirmed that Blessed Runesu Bombshell Geza, a leading figure in Zimbabwean demonstrations and stay-aways, is now on Interpols watchlist. But rather than deterring action, his listing appears to have further galvanised exiled Zimbabweans and international supporters.\n\nThe march saw enthusiastic participation from a broad coalition of groups, including members of Citizens Coalition for Change (CCC), ZAPU, Mthwakazi Republic Party, and others who joined ZHRO in calling for regime change. Under the blazing summer heat, the spirited crowd kept its energy high, drumming and singing all the way.\n\nThere was a roar and thunder in Leeds when drums were beaten by Ettar Mhlanga and Patson Muzuwa, who electrified the atmosphere with energetic drum beating thereby spurring the crowd in a determined move showing that the diaspora community is no longer willing to remain silent.\n\nAmong the organisers of the walk were, Pamela Magwizi, Mgcini Victor Hlophe, Regina Mahowo, Happiness Ncube, Phylis Melody Magejo, Josephine Jenje-Mudimbu and John Burke.\n\nZHRO members in attendance included, Samuel Jambaya, Moses Mbano, Alwyn Mbano, Shepherd Yuda, Shepherd Mungu, Salius Sibanda, Dickson Chikwizo, Henry Makambe, Pretty Ncube, Dadirayi Mukwedeya, Genius Mamwadu, Victor Simon, Denis Gwasira, Philile Dube, Fransisca Chiduku, Ettar Patience Mhlanga, Evy Kangandi, Charles Kanyimo, Tarisai Mapondera, Sandra Chidemo, Jamie Hunter, Milton Bingwa, Dumisani Nyathi, Nobukhosi Dube, and Eness Mapungwana.\n\nCoordinators Petty Ziramba, Patson Muzuwa, Mavis Mutsvangwa and Shepherd Yuda said the Leeds demonstration was part of a global wave of resistance.\n\nIn Canada, solidarity protests were led by activist Mellisa Tonderai Tagarira, while in the United States, 19-year-old Bethel Princess Chiyangwa led a demonstration alongside Panashe Vongai Trish Sivindani. In South Africa Jabulani Ndlovu lead a team of 40 people in their quest to be heard.\n\nThe protestors vowed to continue their campaign until real democratic reform is achieved in Zimbabwe.\n\nFear is no longer an option. We will not stop until our country is free, said one participant.\n\n",
