            "content": "By The Eastleigh Voice\n\nFOUR filmmakers connected to the explosive BBC documentary, Blood Parliament, have been arrested in Nairobi, amid mounting controversy over the governments handling of police killings during last years protests, which were mainly led by Gen Z demonstrators, some of whom were killed by police.\n\nThe filmmakers, Chris Wamae, Nicholas Gichuki, Brian Adagala and Mark Karubiu, were taken into custody early Saturday morning from their studio in Karen.\n\nThe four men are currently being held at Muthaiga and Pangani police stations.\n\nThe arrest follows the release of a 40-minute documentary by BBC Africa Eye, which investigates the killing of peaceful protesters during anti-tax demonstrations outside Parliament in June 2024.\n\nThe film focuses particularly on the death of Eric Shieni, a finance student at the University of Nairobi, who was shot as he was leaving the protest.\n\nIn its documentary, BBC Africa Eye claimed to have reviewed over 150 images and videos taken before and after Shienis death.\n\nThe network said its investigation identified the officer responsible for the killing, who they say is a member of Kenyas armed forces. However, the officers identity has not been officially confirmed, and the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) has denied any involvement.\n\nThe documentary has generated a significant public outcry, raising questions about the use of force by the Kenyan security forces during the protest.\n\nCritics have demanded accountability for those responsible for the deaths and injuries of unarmed protesters.\n\nOn Monday, Kenyan officials blocked a public screening of the documentary, a move that many view as an attempt to silence the investigation and prevent further scrutiny. BBC confirmed that the screening was abruptly cancelled after intervention by local authorities.\n\nThe screening was stopped at the last minute under pressure from the government, the BBC said in a statement.\n\nThis action appears to be an effort to prevent the public from viewing the documentary and its contents.\n\nThe arrest of the filmmakers is seen as part of a broader effort by the government to suppress information related to police misconduct during the protests.\n\nHuman rights organisations have condemned the arrests, calling them an attack on free speech and press freedom.\n\nThe incident has sparked fears of increased government control over the media, especially regarding sensitive political topics.\n\nMany journalists and filmmakers working on politically sensitive stories have expressed concerns about facing similar reprisals.\n\nThe Blood Parliament documentary has put the spotlight on the issue of police violence during the June 2024 protests, which saw dozens of people killed or injured.\n\nAlthough the government has pledged to investigate the deaths, there have been no significant actions taken to hold security officers accountable for the killings.\n\n",

            "content": "By BBC News\n\nTHE Duke of Sussex has told the BBC he would love a reconciliation with the Royal Family, in an emotional interview in which he said he was devastated at losing a legal challenge over his security in the UK.\n\nPrince Harry said the King wont speak to me because of this security stuff, but that he did not want to fight any more and did not know how much longer my father has.\n\nThe prince spoke to BBC News in California after losing an appeal over the levels of security he and his family are entitled to while in the UK.\n\nBuckingham Palace said: All of these issues have been examined repeatedly and meticulously by the courts, with the same conclusion reached on each occasion.\n\nAfter Fridays court ruling, the prince said: I cant see a world in which I would bring my wife and children back to the UK at this point.\n\nThere have been so many disagreements between myself and some of my family, he added, but had now forgiven them.\n\nI would love reconciliation with my family. Theres no point continuing to fight any more, life is precious, said Prince Harry, who said the dispute over his security had always been the sticking point.\n\nThe prince had wanted to overturn changes to his security that were introduced in 2020 as he stepped down as a working royal and moved to the United States.\n\nSaying that he felt let down, he described his court defeat as a good old-fashioned establishment stitch up and blamed the Royal Household for influencing the decision to reduce his security.\n\nAsked whether he had asked the King to intervene in the dispute over security, Prince Harry said: I never asked him to intervene  I asked him to step out of the way and let the experts do their jobs.\n\nThe prince said his treatment during the process of deciding his security had uncovered my worst fears.\n\nHe said of the decision: Im devastated  not so much as devastated with the loss that I am about the people behind the decision, feeling as though this is okay. Is it a win for them?\n\nHe continued: Im sure there are some people out there, probably most likely the people that wish me harm, [who] consider this a huge win.\n\nPrince Harry said the decision to remove his automatic security entitlement impacts him every single day, and has left him in a position where he can only safely return to the UK if invited by the Royal Family  as he would get sufficient security in those circumstances.\n\nThe prince said changes to his security status in 2020 had impacted not just him, but his wife and, later, his children too.\n\nHe went on to say: Everybody knew that they were putting us at risk in 2020 and they hoped that me knowing that risk would force us to come back.\n\nBut then when you realise that didnt work, do you not want to keep us safe?\n\nWhether youre the government, the Royal Household, whether youre my dad, my family  despite all of our differences, do you not want to just ensure our safety?\n\nAsked whether he missed the UK, he added: I love my country, I always have done, despite what some people in that country have done and I think that its really quite sad that I wont be able to show my children my homeland.\n\nPrince Harry said he would not be seeking a further legal challenge, saying Fridays ruling had proven that there was no way to win this through the courts.\n\nI wish someone had told me that beforehand, he said, adding that the ruling had been a surprise.\n\nHe continued: This, at the heart of it, is a family dispute, and it makes me really, really sad that were sitting here today, five years later, where a decision that was made most likely, in fact I know, to keep us under the roof.\n\nHarrys emotional avalanche hits the Royal Family\n\nPrince Harry spoke to the BBC shortly after losing his latest legal challenge against the UK government over the level of security he and his family are entitled to when visiting.\n\nThe Court of Appeal dismissed the princes case, which hinged on how an official committee made the decision to remove his eligibility for automatic, full-scale protection in line with what other senior royals receive.\n\nOn Friday, the court ruled that Prince Harry had made powerful arguments about the level of threat he and his family face, but said his sense of grievance did not translate into a legal argument.\n\nHis legal complaint centred around a committee called the Protection of Royalty and Public Figures (Ravec), which authorises security for senior royals on behalf of the Home Office, and was chaired at the time by Sir Richard Mottram.\n\nUnder the committees regulations, Prince Harry argued, his case should have been put before Ravecs Risk Management Board (RMB), which would have assessed the threats to his and familys security  but that did not happen.\n\nOn Friday, senior judges said the committee had diverged from policy when making its 2020 decision over the princes security, but concluded it had been sensible to do so because of the complexity of his circumstances.\n\nPrince Harry said his jaw hit the floor when he found out a representative of the Royal Household sat on the Ravec committee, and claimed Fridays ruling had proved its decision-making process was more influenced by the Royal Household than by legal constraints.\n\nHe claimed there had been interference by the Royal Household in the 2020 decision, which he said resulted in his status as the most at-risk royal being downgraded to the least at risk overnight.\n\nSo, one does question how that is even possible and also the motive behind that at the time, he added.\n\nPrince Harry called on UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper to intervene in his security case, and to overhaul how the Ravec committee operates.\n\nIn a statement released later on Friday, the prince said he would write to Cooper to ask her to urgently examine the matter and review the Ravec process.\n\n",

Kim was like Paris Hiltons Virgil. Whew.\n\nWhile Yes out here rewriting the family tree in his head, Hilton is living her real-life fairytale and couldnt be more unbothered.

Hiltons got 30 perfumes under her designer belt. The womans perfume empire is practically a shelf-breaker.\n\nAnd in true Hilton style, she stepped behind the DJ booth with a bejewelled hairbrush-mic and lip-synced to her surprisingly well-loved 2006 bop, Stars Are Blind. A hit that critics once raised eyebrows at, but has since aged into a Y2K pop cult classic.\n\nAs for Ye, well, weve seen this pattern before.

We are also focusing on the entire value and supply chains, from chemicals for our tanneries to components for our shoes and leather boots. China produces all of these, and we want strong trade relations to develop our leather value chain, he told Xinhua recently.\n\nThe Chinese market has a strong appetite for leather crafts such as belts, said Zvinondiramba, also secretary of the Bulawayo Leather Cluster (BLC), a group of businesses and individuals promoting the leather industry in Bulawayo, Zimbabwes second-largest city.\n\nZimbabwe has a long-standing tradition of leather craft. The sector benefits from the countrys rich livestock and diverse wildlife resources.\n\nLocal producers use a mix of handcrafting techniques and modern machinery to make products such as bags, shoes, belts and wallets. Unlike mass-produced leather goods made with industrial machinery and standardized designs, crafted leather products feature personalized designs, often made with hand-held tools.\n\nWe have the best hides, the best animals. And we also have a strong historical background in leather crafting. The skill set and infrastructure are already in place. We have those trained in manufacturing, as well as those with natural talent for crafting, Zvinondiramba said.\n\nHe added that other products in the leather value chain, such as raw hides, can also be exported to China.\n\nWe are also looking at promoting our abattoirs in China. With the worlds largest population, China presents a lucrative market for our meat products, especially beef, which is also part of our value chain, he said.\n\nOnce a major regional producer of leather goods, especially shoes, Zimbabwes leather sector is now undergoing a revival.\n\nJoseph Mukondo, a marketing representative for BLC, said that while small-scale producers are playing a vital role in reviving the industry, they face stiff competition from imported second-hand and synthetic footwear.\n\nSo far, the leather industry is struggling due to the influx of cheap synthetic leather imports and second-hand shoes. We are trying to win back customers by promoting genuine leather, but with the current economic hardships, people tend to buy two or three pairs of shoes for 10 U.S. dollars instead of a single genuine leather pair for 20, he said.\n\nWe used to have large foreign companies making shoes in Zimbabwe. Today, most activities are carried out by local start-ups. That is why we are turning to China to help our start-ups grow into major players in the leather sector, Zvinondiramba said.\n\n",

            "content": "South Africas Social Security Agency (SASSA) provides financial assistance to citizens and qualifying residents through various grant programs. These include child support grants, disability grants, old age pensions, and more. But a common question that arises especially among migrants is: Can Zimbabwean immigrants avail SASSA grants?\n\nThis article aims to provide a clear, updated, and SEO-friendly explanation of whether Zimbabwean nationals living in South Africa are eligible for SASSA grants, what types of permits are required, and what alternatives are available for those who are not eligible.\n\nThe South African Social Security Agency (SASSA) is responsible for distributing social grants to help vulnerable individuals and families meet their basic needs. Grants include:\n\nThese grants are primarily meant for South African citizens, but certain categories of non-citizens may also qualify.\n\nCan Zimbabwean Immigrants Qualify for SASSA Grants?\n\nThe short answer is: Not all Zimbabwean immigrants are eligible for SASSA grants, but some may qualify under specific conditions. You can alsoCheck Sassa Statusfor eligibility.\n\nTo qualify for most SASSA grants, an applicant must meet the following criteria:\n\nZimbabwean immigrants in South Africa fall into different legal categories. Heres how that affects their SASSA eligibility:\n\nZimbabweans who have been granted refugee status (under Section 24 of the Refugees Act) are eligible for most SASSA grants. Refugees are treated the same as citizens under South African law for social security purposes.\n\nZEP holders are not eligible for SASSA grants. This is because the ZEP is a special temporary permit that does not confer permanent residency or refugee status.\n\nEven if a ZEP holder lives and works in South Africa legally, they do not meet the criteria for social grants.\n\nAsylum seekers holding Section 22 permits are also not eligible for most SASSA grants. This is because their status is temporary, and their applications for refugee status are still being processed.\n\nIf a Zimbabwean has been granted permanent residency, they become eligible to apply for SASSA grants, just like South African citizens. However, permanent residency is a long and complex process.\n\nSASSA Grants Zimbabweans May Qualify For\n\nHere are some grants that Zimbabwean immigrantsmayaccess under certain conditions:\n\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the SRD grant (R350 grant) was introduced. Initially, it was only for South African citizens, but later expanded to include refugees and asylum seekers with valid documentation from Home Affairs.\n\nWhile this grant was temporary, the SRD R370 grant has replaced it. As of 2024, it is still limited to:\n\nZimbabwean refugees or permanent residents with children may apply for the Child Support Grant, provided:\n\nIf a Zimbabwean refugee or permanent resident wants to apply for a SASSA grant, they will need:\n\nOnly recognized refugees and permanent residents can receive grantsnot all immigrants.\n\nThe ZEP (Zimbabwean Exemption Permit) is not equivalent to permanent residency and does not make the holder eligible for SASSA grants.\n\nSince Zimbabwean Exemption Permit holders are not eligible for SASSA grants, here are a few alternatives:\n\nOrganizations likeDoctors Without Borders (MSF),Scalabrini Centre, andGift of the Giversprovide food, housing, and basic needs support to migrants in need.\n\nZEP holders are legally allowed to work in South Africa. Seeking employment or freelance opportunities can help sustain financial needs.\n\nSome Zimbabwean community associations and churches in South Africa provide assistance to struggling families.\n\nNo. Work permits, including the Zimbabwean Exemption Permit (ZEP), do not qualify you for SASSA grants.\n\nOnly if they areSouth African citizensorrefugees. Children born to ZEP holders are not automatically granted citizenship.\n\nCan asylum seekers from Zimbabwe apply for the R370 grant?\n\nOnly under special temporary rulings. Most are not eligible unless otherwise stated by SASSA or government policy.\n\nWhile Zimbabwean immigrants contribute significantly to South African society, their eligibility for SASSA grants is limited. Only those with refugee status or permanent residency may legally access these social welfare benefits. ZEP holders and asylum seekers remain excluded, though they may access help through NGOs and community support networks.\n\nIf youre unsure about your status or rights, consult with legal aid organizations or visit your local SASSA office for accurate guidance.\n\n",
