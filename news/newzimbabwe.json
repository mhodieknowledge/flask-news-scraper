arrested early Friday morning when a car he was travelling in was stopped, searched and discovered to have 26 blasting cartridges and 15 capped fuse connectors; which are both forms of explosives.Images of him in handcuffs were plastered over the internet, with Zanu PF acolytes celebrating it like a win.He is being held at Pretoria Central and expected to appear in court on Monday.His South African lawyer Eric Mabuza said Sikhala was denying any knowledge of the crime while the South African Police Service (SAPS) had already made efforts to review footage at a mall the former legislator visited earlier.Sikhala was said to have been arrested after going for dinner with one of his uncles (also in police custody).It is an allegation he denies, Mabuza told state broadcaster SABC after meeting with Sikhala.He says that this is foul play because when he went out with his uncle for dinner he was not carrying any explosives but those were found as he was driving out.He said he did not come here for explosives but for medical attention.Indeed, Sikhala has been frequenting South Africa for medical help after spending over 500 days in pretrial detention before being released without charge.He was not just kept under the worst conditions but subjected to inhumane treatment over the entire period, which not only cost him his law firm but almost derailed his political career.Jacob Ngarivhume, another opposition figure in Zimbabwean politics described the explosives as having been planted in a post on X that confirmed that his family had been made aware.The pressure group he leads, the National Democratic Working Group said it suspected foul play.\n\nSikhala was arrested early Friday morning when a car he was travelling in was stopped, searched

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nA FORWARD-THINKING fintech company, EazzyPay, based in Zimbabwe, has officially launched a comprehensive digital payment platform aimed at streamlining both individual and business financial transactions.\n\nThe platform, accessible via mobile app, WhatsApp bot, and web interface, offers a seamless experience for a range of services, from purchasing electricity tokens and airtime to booking event tickets, paying bills, and even accessing corporate solutions like bulk airtime purchases and virtual fiscalisation devices.\n\nEazzyPays launch comes at a time when digital payment adoption in Zimbabwe is accelerating.\n\nAccording to the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ), the total transaction value processed via digital payment systems reached ZWL 205.49 billion (approx. US$7.78 billion) in August, with 71.42 million transactions recorded. In contrast, cash-based transactions totalled only ZWG 12.66 billion.\n\nSpeaking at the official launch event in Harare, EazzyPays Chief Executive Officer, Tabeth Revesai Nyahasha, emphasised the platforms potential to revolutionise the way Zimbabweans engage with digital finance.\n\nWith our unified approach, we aim to eliminate the inefficiencies that have historically plagued digital payments  from multiple platforms and long wait times to limited access and a lack of transaction transparency, Nyahasha said.\n\nOur mission is to empower communities by offering a faster, more secure, and more accessible payment solution.\n\nThe Zimbabwean fintech landscape is rapidly evolving. Data from the central bank reveals that electronic transactions processed through the National Payment Systems (NPS) grew by 23.09% in Q2 2025, reaching ZWL 655.6 billion (approximately US$24.33 billion). Despite this growth, EazzyPay identified a gap in the market for a unified platform to address the fragmented nature of digital payments, particularly for retail transactions, which accounted for US$5.93 billion in the second quarter alone.\n\nPayments Made Easy  EazzyPays tagline  underscores its core promise: simplifying financial transactions for both individuals and businesses. The platform seeks to increase financial inclusion, particularly in underserved rural areas, by offering a solution that removes barriers such as long queues, restrictive operating hours, and complex user interfaces.\n\nAlex Kuzakwawo, EazzyPays Operations Director, assured users of the platforms robust security features.\n\nWith WhatsApps end-to-end encryption, all transactions are safeguarded, ensuring that only the user has access to their financial information, he explained.\n\nFurthermore, payments are validated by EcoCash, where the users PIN is required for authorization. EazzyPay itself is a facilitator, ensuring that security protocols are strictly adhered to.\n\nAs Zimbabwe continues to transition towards a predominantly digital economy, EazzyPays platform is poised to become a key player in driving both financial inclusion and economic participation across the country. The launch reflects the broader trend of fintech innovation across Africa, where digital solutions are helping bridge the gap between the unbanked and essential financial services.\n\nBy replacing fragmentation with integration, were not just simplifying payments  were enabling a more inclusive, connected economy, added Nyahasha.\n\n",
