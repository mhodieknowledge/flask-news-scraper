            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe High Court has set Wednesday for pre-sentencing proceedings for convicted businessmen Moses Mpofu and Mike Chimombe, marking what Justice Pisirayi Kwenda described as the long-overdue conclusion to their protracted, year-and-a-half legal battle.\n\nMpofu and Chimombe were recently found guilty of defrauding the Ministry of Agriculture of US$7 million after securing a US$87 million tender for the Presidential Goat Scheme using Blackdeck, a company that does not exist. The two have been in custody since their arrest in June last year after multiple failed attempts to secure bail and halt proceedings.\n\nOn Monday, the pair tried to stall the sentencing phase by demanding a written copy of the judgment convicting them. Justice Kwenda dismissed the request, noting he had already delivered the ruling in open court and that their lawyers were expected to take notes. He described the renewed demand as a delaying tactic without legal merit.\n\nThe duo then sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, but that application was also thrown out.\n\nLeave to appeal the ruling at the Supreme Court is dismissed, Justice Kwenda ruled. My decision is that we move to the pre-sentencing stage, and we should proceed on Wednesday. We should not keep delaying this matter. Let us all come to court on Wednesday prepared for the pre-sentencing procedures.\n\nThe case was subsequently adjourned to 19 November 2025 at 1400 hours.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nThe sentencing of convicted businessmen Moses Mpofu and Mike Chimombewas further delayed on Monday to 1430 hoursafter their lawyers insisted they could not proceed without the written judgment, prompting Justice Pisirayi Kwendato reserve his ruling.\n\nLovemore Madhuku, taking instructions from Ashiel Mugiya and representing Chimombe, made an oral application in terms of section 4 of the sentencing guidelines, arguing that a copy of the written judgment of the copy that was read in court when they were convicted was essential for a fair sentencing process.\n\nWe are making the application in terms of sec 4 of the sentencing guidelines, he said, adding that although there was no express procedure, the guidelines give rights to accused persons. He argued that the Constitution gives the accused the right to a fair trial, and without sight of the written judgment, they will be unable to do proper mitigation and they will also be unable to respond adequately to the submission by the state on aggravation.\n\nHe said this would render their trial not fair, stressing that the accused did not take notes and needed to scrutinise the written judgment in the sense that it is relevant to the sentencing. Said Madhuku: It is a legal right of the applicant to get the judgment The request made by the accused persons is clearly not out of this world.\n\nThe accused persons certainly need the judgment to make preparations for the next steps. If the court says it is not readily available, the accused can wait; they are already in custody, he added, citing section 17(1)(c) which entitles an accused to be given adequate time and facilities to prepare a defence. He insisted, The request we are making is not too much. The judgment gives reasons for the convictions and the reasons are relevant for sentencing.\n\nTapson Dzvetero, representing Mpofu, concurred, saying proceeding without a written judgment would prejudice their clients. He said the law requires the court to produce its written judgment in accordance with legal provisions.\n\nState counsel Whisper Mabhaudhi opposed the application, arguing that the law provides only one circumstance where sentencing cannot proceed and there is nothing that can stop this court from sentencing the accused person. He said the defence did not cite relevant sections 331 and 333, instead relying on section 4, which is not applicable at all.\n\nMabhaudhi submitted that the request amounted to seeking further information, yet the judgment had already been delivered in open court, where parties were supposed to take notes, and no undertaking was made to release a written judgment before sentencing. The judgment which was delivered in the presence of the accused persons was final, he said.\n\nHe argued the accused do not require this judgment for any particular reason at all other than being a matter of preference, adding that their lawyers notes would suffice. Issues about the degree of participation were issues of appeal, he said.\n\nMabhaudhi added that proceedings were livestreamed and the accused were at liberty to go to YouTube where the proceedings were covered live The judgment is available in a video format, which they are at liberty to listen to at their own time.\n\nMadhuku dismissed that argument, saying, The accused persons do not have access to YouTube and we cannot take away the role they play in their own trial despite having lawyers.\n\nJustice Kwenda reserved the ruling to 1430 hours.\n\nThe pair was due for sentencing after being convicted of US$7 million fraud. Their sentencing has been repeatedly delayed, including after the State withdrew its earlier application for forfeiture of their properties.\n\n",

He is also a recipient of the SSRC Next Generation Social Sciences Fellowship (2023).\n\nThe appointment marks a return to organised scholarly activism for a journalist whose career has consistently bridged research, teaching, and frontline media work. For many observers in the journalism education sector, Chaunza represents a generation of scholar-practitioners pushing for African media curricula rooted in community knowledge, public accountability, and resistance to repression.\n\n",

This is what all the great directors have done.Six months since a conclave of cardinals elected the first North American to the Papacy, some Catholics feel that Leo has been slow to stamp his own mark on the role.His predecessor, Francis, was a charismatic Argentinian known for his off-the-cuff comments and dramatic gestures. Leos style is far quieter, so this star-studded engagement is a new look.Its not clear how the cast list was drawn up, although none of the directors in the hall  who came from all over the world  made it onto the Popes own top film list.This week, the Vatican revealed that his favourite four watches of all time included the 1960s nun-themed classic The Sound of Music, Its a Wonderful Life and Italian Roberto Benignis multi award-winning Life is Beautiful.Among those who did join todays A-list audience were Mortensen, Chris Pine and filmmaker Gus Van Sant  of Milk and Good Will Hunting fame. The large Italian contingent included Gianni Amelio and Cinema Paradiso creator, Giuseppe Tornatore.At a time of immense pressure on film, not long after a major Hollywood strike and with funding strains here in Italy, the Pope spoke in defence of the industry.He was applauded loudly when he talked of the quiet dedication of all those behind the scenes with vital roles.He also warned against the closure of cinemas which he characterised as the beating heart of communities.More than a few people are saying that the art of cinema and the cinematic experience are in danger.
