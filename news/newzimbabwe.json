            "content": "The South African\n\nZimbabwean rapperAwa Khiwehas married a Qwabe man fromKwaNongomain KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, marking not just a union of love, but a powerful moment of cultural fusion.\n\nThe intimate traditional wedding, held recently in KwaZulu-Natal, celebrated African heritage and cross-border unity.\n\nBorn Awakhiwe Sibanda, the musician expresses fierce pride in her Ndebele roots as a rapper.\n\nI felt welcomed, she said in an exclusive interview withThe South African.\n\nReferring to her Ndebele roots Awa Khiwe said: They call meumzukulu kaMashobane(the grand daughter of Mashobane). I think once you show people respect, they know you were raised well. Where you come from becomes a secondary issue.\n\nDespite cultural similarities, Awa Khiwe revealed that her upbringing in a Zimbabwean village in Nkayi prepared her for life in KwaNongoma.\n\nBeing raised in the village helped me shape my cultural identity. The KwaNongoma lifestyle is similar to that of Nkayi its not a huge adjustment.\n\nAwa Khiwe, renowned for championing Ndebele pride on global stages, has opened up about embracing a more traditional role in her personal life.\n\nNow living in a new home, the outspoken rapper revealed that while many know her as a fierce and fearless queen, she proudly takes on the role of being a loved,spoiled and submissive wife to her Zulu husband.\n\nSpeaking candidly, she said she respects both Zulu and Ndebele cultures, describing the union as a beautiful exchange rather than a clash.\n\nAwa said her open-mindedness allows her to find strength in unity and mutual respect, rather than division, even in deeply rooted cultural differences.\n\nVeteran actor Ernest Ndlovu joined Awa Khiwe in KwaNongoma to celebrate her wedding day.

I juggle music and family, Im old enough to handle the situation.\n\nHer husband, a Qwabe man involved in the construction industry, has been in her life for years. The two met through a mutual friend, Macingwana, and nurtured their relationship quietly before tying the knot in a ceremony that honoured both families.\n\nOn social media, she called it the best day of my life and added in a heartfelt tribute:\n\nThank you for keeping your promise, my love. I promise to love, honour, respect and protect you, till death do us part.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) Thursday upheld the tight Monetary Policy stance as a strategy to conserve the local currency.\n\nPresenting the Mid-Term Monetary Policy Statement (MPS), premised under the theme Walking The Talk And Staying The Course, the central bank governor, Dr John Mushayavanhu, once again stated that the bank was receiving widespread acclaim for its sustained exchange rate stability.\n\nThe RBZ projected inflation to end the year at around 30%, giving a positive real interest rate of 5% and maintained the Bank Policy rate at 35% despite sustained outcry from industry on the need to ease the cost of borrowing.\n\nThe high policy rate has choked productivity in the recent past by worsening the cost of capital to fund critical industry needs. However, on its part, the RBZ believes that such rates are necessary to curb speculative borrowing.\n\nOn bank charges, the MPS implored banks to adhere to the measures announced in the February 2025 Monetary Policy Statement to exempt from bank charges all accounts that maintain a balance below US$100 or its equivalent in ZiG.\n\nIn addition, Point of Sale (POS) transactions for amounts less than US$5 or its equivalent in ZiG were also exempted from transaction charges for both banking institutions and Payment System Providers (PSPs).\n\nWhile a noble step, the move falls far short of addressing the thorn in flesh for the transacting public who are ordinarily forced to part ways with US$3,00 per every US$100 withdrawn from banks, a position which increases the cost of doing business, especially for corporates who withdraw large volumes of money.\n\nThe current statutory reserve requirements are set between 15% and 30% depending on the nature of the deposits. Banking institutions can, therefore, easily reduce the effective statutory reserve requirements towards 15% by attracting more long-term deposits.\n\nThe statutory reserve ratios, therefore, remain unchanged and will be reviewed when appropriate and consistent with the monetary policy thrust, reads the MPS in part.\n\nThis is despite complaints from the banking sector alleging that high statutory reserves are mopping up excess resources necessary to support productive lending.\n\nThe MPS maintained the export surrender thresholds at 30% but did not address the pertinent concerns raised by exporters who allege they have not been paid the ZWG portion for a prolonged period of time in what experts believe to be one of the strategies to protect the local unit.\n\nMarket watchers suspect that the move to withhold the export surrender thresholds for fear of weakening ZWG is an indication of a currency facing the crisis of fragility.\n\nDespite having triggered fears across the markets on impending monocurrency by 2030, Dr Mushayavanhus MPS did not disclose the practical roadmap to his course of action, instead opting to give assurances of a workable process.\n\nThe de-dollarisation roadmap will be crystallised in the National Development Strategy II and the Reserve Bank, which is chairing the NDS2 Thematic Working Group on Macroeconomic Stability and Financial Deepening (MESFIND) is currently seized with consultations on the issue.\n\nThe roadmap will undoubtedly encapsulate the need to maintain the current stability, preserve the foreign currency accounts and the value of the existing USD-denominated contracts. Consideration will always be made to ensure that there is business continuity and certainty, the MPS added.\n\n",
