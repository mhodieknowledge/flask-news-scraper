However, it still has a long way to go before it becomes the sole legal tender for Zimbabwe, says Lyle Begbie, an economist at Oxford Economics Africa.\n\nZimbabwes history of hyperinflation and failed monetary experiments means itremainshighly dollarized. The U.S.dollar is the main medium of exchange, while the share ofZiGin monetary aggregates is small at around 17%. Prices are rarely quoted inZiG, and salaries and goods and services transactions are typically either fully or partially paid in U.S.dollars.\n\nWhile stabilizing inflation is undoubtedly positive, the landlocked nationwill need to remain steadfastregardingother challenges,before unlocking national sovereignty. Zimbabwes public debt, which reached $23.2 billion in 2024 (72.9% of GDP),per the World Bank,remainsa discouraging barrier to foreign investment.\n\nZimbabwes debt arrearssubstantially weighon its economic growth outlook, Begbie explains, before adding, Due to these arrears, the country cannot access concessional funding from multilateralorganizations, andis excluded from obtaining any sort of debt relief.\n\nThe World Bank has placed Zimbabwe in non-accrual status since 2000.

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nThe Mutapa Investment Fund (MIF) mining cluster has produced a total of 2.4 tons of gold in the first nine months of the year, with plans underway to further boost output through targeted strategic interventions.\n\nAs the principal investment arm of the Zimbabwean government, MIF is a sector-agnostic sovereign fund that invests in opportunities aligned with national development priorities across agriculture, renewable energy, technology, and mining. The Fund derives income primarily through dividends and investment returns, and may selectively pursue third-party funding while maintaining conservative leverage under strict risk and governance frameworks.\n\nAddressing delegates at the Zimbabwe Gold Investment Conference 2025, MIF Deputy Chief Investment Officer Ernest Denhere said the strong performance was driven by investee companies within the mining cluster.\n\nThe Fund has strong presence in the gold space through Kuvimba Mining House (KMH) and Defold Mine, delivering 29% of Large Scale Miners gold to Fidelity between January and September, at 2.4 tons. The Fund recognises that gold currently presents a unique opportunity for value creation and growth in export receipts, he said.\n\nMIF officials noted that precious metals, especially gold, have surged in 2025 as investors seek safe-haven assets amid geopolitical and economic uncertainty. Gold has gained 56% year-to-date, while Zimbabwes gold exports have grown by 71% for the nine months to September 2025.\n\nDenhere said the value of gold exported by September stood at US$3.2 billion, with artisanal and small-scale miners contributing 74% of total gold output.\n\nWith a funding pipeline of at least US$500 million across several gold projects, the Fund is open to exploring different strategies to support the sector and bolster the gold value chain. MIF is a long-term, non-speculative investor focused on providing patient capital to its investors.\n\nThe Funds strategy also includes establishing an exploration fund. With gold as a safe-haven asset with long-term upside, there is strong upside for new discoveries, added Denhere.\n\n",
