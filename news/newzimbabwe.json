            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA retired pastor who tried to evade repaying a US$22,750 loan by falsely claiming illiteracy has lost his case at the High Court, which ordered him to settle the debt and declared his Budiriro house executable.\n\nJudges of appeal Justices Hapias Zhou and Benjamin Chikowero ruled that Pastor Stefan Pios Mumbiro knowingly signed all loan and mortgage documents binding him to businessman Collins Farai Muchada, but later attempted to take advantage of his supposed illiteracy to escape liability.\n\nThe first respondent was not illiterate. He was educated up to Grade 7, could read and write, and even successfully undertook pastoral studies, the judges said. He cannot evade responsibility by pretending not to understand what he signed.\n\nThe court condemned Mumbiros conduct, saying he had taken advantage of Muchadas trust while later seeking to hide behind claims of being duped.\n\nEvidence before the court showed that Mumbiro willingly signed an Acknowledgement of Debt, a Power of Attorney to register a Mortgage Bond, and other loan documents, all of which were verified by a handwriting expert.\n\nThe only credible evidence on record was that adduced by the appellant himself, amply corroborated by the Questioned Document Examiner, the Acknowledgement of Debt, the Power of Attorney to Pass Mortgage Bond, the Mortgage Bond, and the Forensic Examination Report, Chikowero said.\n\nThe court said Mumbiros story fell apart under cross-examination when he admitted signing blank papers, a move the judges described as a deliberate attempt to distort facts and mislead the court.\n\nCiting the long-standing legal principle of caveat subscriptor, the bench reminded litigants that a party to a contract is bound by his signature, whether or not he has read or understood the document.\n\nChikowero criticised the lower court for allowing Mumbiro to eat his cake and still have it by accepting contradictory statements about how much he borrowed.\n\nAs a result, the High Court ordered Mumbiro to repay US$22,750 plus interest and costs, and ruled that his Budiriro home, Stand 2308 of Willowvale Estate, be declared specially executable should he fail to pay.\n\nIn their judgment, the judges issued a clear warning to others attempting similar deceit.\n\nThe loud and clear message to go out from the court is: businessmen beware. If you fail to honour your contracts, dont start crying when the other party obtains an order compelling you to perform.\n\nMumbiro had earlier accused Muchada of being a fraudster who wants to con me of my house, but the judges found no proof of that claim.\n\nThe case originated at the Harare Magistrates Court, where Mumbiro initially won after convincing the magistrate that he was illiterate and had been duped. However, the High Court overturned that decision, ruling that Mumbiro had instead abused the courts sympathy and his position as a retired pastor to avoid his legal obligations.\n\n",
