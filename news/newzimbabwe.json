These are considered to be a type of option since they give a companys stockholders the right, but not the obligation, to purchase additional shares in the company.\n\nOK Zimbabwe is grappling with a mounting debt crisis of almost US$30 million accumulated over recent years.\n\nA detailed breakdown of the arrears shows the company owes US$24 million to suppliers, US$5.12 million in other payables such as utilities and service providers, and US$880,000 in statutory obligations.\n\nTo avert the crisis, the top retailer has since sacked its top management team, placed selected properties on sale and moved to float a Rights Offer.\n\nIn a latest announcement to shareholders this week, OK Zimbabwe company secretary, Margaret Munyuru said the offer was well subscribed with 100% uptake of the offer.\n\nTotal Rights Offer shares subscribed for 1 834 982 573 amount raised US$20 million 100% Rights Offer Shares. The Rights Offer was fully subscribed through a combination of shareholder take up underwriters in accordance with the underwriting agreement, she said.\n\nThe Board expressed its appreciation to shareholders for their continued support and to the underwriters for their commitment to the success of the capital raising exercise.\n\nProceeds from the Rights Offer will be applied towards partial settlement of legacy creditors, supporting the Companys working capital expenditure requirements and unlocking fresh supplier support.\n\nThe board also wishes to advise shareholders that the process relating to property disposal programme remains on-going.\n\nThe company are currently receiving and evaluating offers for the identified properties, with discussions under way to ensure that any transactions concluded are in the best interests of shareholders and are consistent with the companys strategic objectives, added Munyuru.\n\n",

The time to act is now, not later, he said.But in a statement, the ZCTU acting secretary general, Runesu Dzimiri said issuing such drastic measures move without an alternative is not favourable for the people of Zimbabwe, especially at a time when 88% of the population is working in the informal economy.He reminded the government that the chaos in the streets is a direct result of poor policies and weak governance systems, which have plunged the nation into chaos.The streets are congested with millions of graduates from tertiary institutions, because the economy has failed to create enough jobs to absorb job seekers owing to the collapse of the industry. Unemployment and the high cost of living are also factors forcing citizens into night vending.The National Development Strategy 1 had envisioned to create 760,000 jobs for the period 2020-2025 however, this has not been the case, he said.Dzimiri urged the government to accept the reality that even the smaller percentage currently employed is barely receiving a living wage and are now subsiding salaries with vending machines, making the trade the only option in the face of unsustainable unemployment levels.The ZCTU criticised the government for overseeing the construction of irrelevant workspaces across the country arguing that such initiatives lack the appreciation of how the informal sector works.We note and appreciate the establishment of vending stalls in places like Mbare and other sites as a great move. However, issues of accessibility to these sites are a barrier discouraging people to go and occupy those stalls, he said.He said going forward, Local authorities need to learn and apply the City of Mutare model which identified areas for night vending and established such places for licensed vendors in a move which has assisted in controlling waste disposal, poor sanitation and has also boosted revenues while for local enhancing service delivery.Dzimiri said the governments mantra of leaving no person and no place behind should encompass policy making processes.This ban will leave many unemployed and vulnerable women, youths and graduates roaming in the streets vending behind, suffering and continuously wallowing in poverty.The Vision 2030 of an upper middle class income economy needs strategic interventions to address the economic crisis, not these drastic, repulsive orders that will only cause chaos as police chase vendors without addressing the root causes of the challenges facing millions of Zimbabwe, he added.\n\nRecently, Local Government Minister, Daniel Garwe touched a raw nerve after issuing a directive to ban night vending.\n\nNight vending has brought with it illicit drug and substance dealings, which is a threat to health, economy and national security.The importation and selling of second-hand clothing is banned, and consequently street and night vending activities are equally banned.

According to the ministry, localised person-to-person transmission has been documented, often through household contact and healthcare-associated exposure, particularly in settings lacking appropriate protective measures.\n\nThe WHO is reporting ongoing outbreaks across Africa, including some Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries, raising fears of cross-border spread.\n\nThis poses a heightened risk of cross-border transmission, the ministry cautioned.\n\nIn response, Zimbabwe has scaled up disease surveillance and reinforced screening measures at all Points of Entry (PoEs).\n\nThe ministry urged the public to strictly follow WHO-recommended preventive measures, warning including avoiding physical contact with individuals showing symptoms of Mpox, sharing clothes, bedding and towels among other things.\n\nThe ministry also encouraged the public to be vigilant and act swiftly if they suspect infection. Members of the public are encouraged to report any suspected cases to the nearest health facility promptly, it said.\n\nMpox spreads primarily through close contact and can cause fever, rash, and swollen lymph nodes, sometimes leading to severe illness.\n\n",

            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nZANU PF has finally confirmed the co-option of party benefactor Kudakwashe Tagwirei into the partys Central Committee.\n\nTagwirei, whose initial appearance in the Central Committee became national news, becomes one of the newest members in one of the governing partys most powerful organs.According to Zanu PF Secretary for Legal Affairs Patrick Chinamasa, Tagwirei who was recommended by Harare province joins Polite Kambamura (Mashonaland West), Joseph Serima, Christine Gwati and Collen Ndebele, who were all recommended by Matabeleland North province.The co-options were confirmed after the 385th Ordinary Session of the Politburo this week following a vote by the Harare Provincial Coordinating Committee in Tagwireis case.The Politburo has endorsed co-options from Mashonaland West, Matabeleland North and Harare, with all expected to be formally adopted by the Central Committee at the next meeting.Tagwirei was co-opted by Harare Province and is now a Central Committee member, said Chinamasa.Unlike the first time when Tagwirei had to be escorted out of the Central Committee, Chinamasa reckoned that all procedures had been followed, with their appearance expected at the next meeting.Power struggles between rival factions within Zanu PF had been fingered as a major reason why Tagwirei was being shut out of the influential body.The wealthy businessman, who turned to politics earlier this year, is reportedly eyeing a shot at the presidency in the near future, with unconfirmed reports saying he is the likeliest to take over.His decision has irked ambitious party spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa, who fancies himself suitable candidate to replace President Emmerson Mnangagwa even ahead of one-time-favourite Constantino Chiwenga, his deputy.\n\nTagwirei, whose initial appearance in the Central Committee became national news, becomes one of the newest members in one of the governing partys most powerful
