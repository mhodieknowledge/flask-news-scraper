            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHE Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) has appealed to the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC), seeking its intervention in a protracted dispute with government over the demand for a living wagea dispute that has persisted since October 2018.\n\nIn correspondence submitted to the ZHRC, the union detailed a series of incidents in which teachers have not only been underpaid but have also suffered a litany of infringements upon their constitutional rights.In a statement, ARTUZ president Obert Masaraure said teachers had alerted the ZHRC to what they describe as the governments ongoing violations of labour and human rights.The Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) has today, 23 May 2025, officially submitted a detailed complaint to the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC), highlighting the governments sustained and systematic violation of teachers fundamental rights, said Masaraure.He added: The complaint outlines serious breaches of constitutional and labour rights including:1) Denial of the right to a fair wage (Section 65(1) of the Constitution)2) Suppression of the right to strike and freedom of protest,3) Refusal to honour the right to collective bargaining (Section 65(5),4) Infringement of womens rights through denial of absolute paid maternity leave.The union maintains that these complaints are substantiated by legal arguments referencing both international labour standards and regional precedents, and has called upon the ZHRC to intervene.ARTUZ is demanding that the government pays teachers a fair and living wage of at least US$1,260 per month, guarantee the constitutional right to strike and peaceful protest, align the Public Service Act and its regulations with the Constitution, uphold womens labour rights by granting absolute paid maternity leave, and foster genuine dialogue with trade unions to rebuild a meaningful social contract.The union further claims to have meticulously documented cases of harassment, unlawful dismissal, intimidation, and the systematic silencing of educators who speak out or demand justice.Masaraure cited the arrest and protracted trial of ARTUZ secretary general Robson Chere, as well as the punitive disciplinary measures imposed on more than 50 union members for their lawful participation in strikes and peaceful picketing, as illustrative examples.Our teachers are not demanding miracles  they are demanding justice. What is being done to educators in Zimbabwe is a violation of both our Constitution and our humanity, said Masaraure.ARTUZ has called upon the media, civil society and other stakeholders to stand in solidarity with teachers in their quest for what the union describes as a just, equitable and rights-based education system in Zimbabwe.Against this backdrop, the Zimbabwean government continues to grapple with the challenge of paying civil servants a living wage, with similar grievances being raised by lecturers and staff across State universities.\n\nIn correspondence submitted to the ZHRC, the union detailed a series of incidents in which teachers have not only been underpaid but have also suffered a litany of infringements upon their constitutional rights.\n\nIn a statement, ARTUZ president Obert Masaraure said teachers had alerted the ZHRC to what they describe as the governments ongoing violations of labour and human rights.The Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) has today, 23 May 2025, officially submitted a detailed complaint to the Zimbabwe Human Rights Commission (ZHRC), highlighting the governments sustained and systematic violation of teachers fundamental rights, said Masaraure.He added: The complaint outlines serious breaches of constitutional and labour rights including:1) Denial of the right to a fair wage (Section 65(1) of the Constitution)2) Suppression of the right to strike and freedom of protest,3) Refusal to honour the right to collective bargaining (Section 65(5),4) Infringement of womens rights through denial of absolute paid maternity leave.The union maintains that these complaints are substantiated by legal arguments referencing both international labour standards and regional precedents, and has called upon the ZHRC to intervene.ARTUZ is demanding that the government pays teachers a fair and living wage of at least US$1,260 per month, guarantee the constitutional right to strike and peaceful protest, align the Public Service Act and its regulations with the Constitution, uphold womens labour rights by granting absolute paid maternity leave, and foster genuine dialogue with trade unions to rebuild a meaningful social contract.The union further claims to have meticulously documented cases of harassment, unlawful dismissal, intimidation, and the systematic silencing of educators who speak out or demand justice.Masaraure cited the arrest and protracted trial of ARTUZ secretary general Robson Chere, as well as the punitive disciplinary measures imposed on more than 50 union members for their lawful participation in strikes and peaceful picketing, as illustrative examples.Our teachers are not demanding miracles  they are demanding justice.

appearance on June 13, 2025.None of the witnesses that have been presented at court has indicated any knowledge of the relationship between the complainant and defendant.The State said it will lead

extortion and criminal abuse of duty.\n\nThe trio is accused of soliciting bribes from two complainants in connection with the release of an impounded truck and to influence the proceedings of an ongoing criminal case.According to the Zimbabwe Anti-Corruption Commission (ZACC), in March 2025, one complainant leased her truck for transporting agricultural goods from Honde Valley to Harare.On March 26, the truck was impounded by Tivafukidze and Masase, at a road block in Marara area on suspicion of transporting smuggled goods, said ZACC in a statement.The trucks cargo owners were also arrested at that time.After the incident, Chavarika, who was prosecuting the related case, allegedly contacted one of the complainants on April 3, summoning her to Hauna.There, Tivafukidze and Chavarika who are stationed at Mutasa Police Station allegedly demanded a US$500 bribe to secure the trucks release.The complainant initially paid US$170 in cash and then transferred an additional US$100 via Ecocash the following day.Despite assurances from Chavarika that the truck would be released by April 9, it was instead directed to the ZIMRA compound at Forbes Border Post.Further demands for an additional US$300 were allegedly made to secure the acquittal of the cargo owners detained during the initial incident.This prompted the complainants to report the alleged misconduct to ZACC.Following an undercover operation, the three officials were arrested at the Mutasa Magistrate Court, during which US$200 in cash was recovered from Chavarika.They have since appeared before Mutare Provincial Magistrate Enia Ndiraya and are currently out on US$100 bail each.Trial commences on June 5.\n\nThe trio is accused of soliciting bribes from two complainants in connection with the
