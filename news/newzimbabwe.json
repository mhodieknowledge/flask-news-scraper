With due respect, our client as it stands, does not know the reasons why your committee concluded that he has failed to meet the eligibility criteria stipulated in the ZIFA statutes, 2024 before making your announcement and publishing the final list of candidates, read the letter.\n\nThe barring of the four candidates has left Nqobile Magwizi, Twine Phiri, Marshal Gore, Philemon Machana, Martin Kweza and Makwinje Phiri contesting for the presidency.\n\nAccording to the ZIFA statutes, the barred candidates have the option to seek remedy from the Court of Arbitrationfor Sports (CAS) in Switzerland.\n\nOutgoing Castle Lager Premier Soccer League (PSL) chairperson Farai Jere has also demanded answers from ZIFA.\n\nI hold high and esteemed offices and do not want my name to be sullied by misconceptions that I do not have 5 0 levels. I therefore kindly ask for a detailed explanation of the considerations that led to this outcome. I would appreciate receiving this information at your earliest convenience, preferably before Christmas, said Jere.\n\n",

When they voice their concerns, they often face derogatory labels that suppress their voices.\n\nOur word of encouragement is that they should not be deterred. They should defend their rights as difficult as it might.\n\nWe are happy that we now have women who now hold titles previously reserved for men, she noted.\n\nIYWD is a young feminist organisation dedicated to amplifying the voices and experiences of young women in marginalized communities.\n\nThe organisation is committed to mobilising and empowering young women by enhancing their capacity to participate and contribute to holistic and gender-responsive community development.\n\nSince its inception in 2009, IYWD has successfully engaged with marginalised young women and girls, who have grown aware of their roles in community development and local governance, advocating for gender-responsive social service delivery in alignment with constitutional mandates for citizen engagement in local governance.\n\nWe do this work through engaging authentically with the Government of Zimbabwe, independent commissions, corporations, traditional chiefs, religious leaders, family, and with each other.\n\n",

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nHigh Court judges Justices Esther Muremba and Deputy Judge President Garainesu Mawadze have urged the legislature to broaden the sentencing jurisdiction of regional magistrates so they can impose sentences that more accurately reflect the severity of the offences they adjudicate.\n\nCurrently, magistrates sentencing powers are limited to just 12 years, despite their handling of serious and complex criminal cases.\n\nUnder the new sentencing guidelines, robbery offences committed under aggravating circumstances carry a presumptive penalty of 20 years imprisonment.\n\nThis is significantly higher than the 12-year cap imposed on regional magistrates for such offences, as outlined in section 51(2)(b)(ii) of the Magistrates Court Act [Chapter 7:10].\n\nWhen the presumptive penalty surpasses the limits of magistrate jurisdiction, cases must be referred to higher courts that can impose appropriate sentences.\n\nThis call to action from the judges was prompted by the case of armed robbers Israel Mufure (22) and Charles Murinda (55), who terrorised a school in Norton by robbing five teachers in a dramatic style using a pellet gun to intimidate their victims.\n\nBoth individuals faced charges and were convicted of five counts of robbery and one count of unlawful entry into premises. They each received a 10-year prison sentence for the first five robbery counts, which were consolidated for sentencing purposes, and another 10 years for the sixth count.\n\nJustice Muremba expressed concern that the sentence was excessively lenient, given the nature of the offence.\n\nI have reservations regarding the sentence for the first to fifth counts, which I find to be unduly lenient considering the aggravating circumstances under which the robberies were committed, said Muremba.\n\nShe went on to explain how she had queried the regional magistrate about the 10-year sentence for multiple counts of robbery committed under aggravating circumstances.\n\nWhen I queried the learned regional magistrate about the 10-year sentence for five counts of robbery committed under aggravating circumstances, given the presumptive penalty of 20 years imprisonment for one count, she replied that her jurisdiction in robbery cases is limited to 12 years under section 51(3) of the Magistrates Court Act [Chapter 7:10], Muremba noted.\n\nMuremba indicated that the magistrate did not elaborate on her reasoning or clarify why she considered 12 years to be the normal range for a sentence in light of the higher presumptive penalty detailed in the guidelines.\n\nThe regional magistrate handling this matter should have been aware of this when sentencing the accused.\n\nShe should have acknowledged in her sentencing judgment that the presumptive penalty exceeded her jurisdictional limits and explained her approach to sentencing the accused in light of this discrepancy.\n\nMurembasaidthe belief that the maximum sentencing jurisdiction reflects the normal sentencing range raises significant concerns.\n\nWhile adhering to jurisdictional limits is necessary, this view may indicate a disconnect from the sentencing guidelines, which suggest a presumptive penalty of 20 years. It appears the learned regional magistrate has not fully embraced or given due weight to the new sentencing framework, the judgesaid.\n\nShe pointed out that regional magistrates predominantly handle robbery cases with aggravating circumstances.\n\nTherefore, it is crucial that their sentencing jurisdiction be expanded to ensure that they can adequately and efficiently impose sentences that reflect the severity of these offences.\n\nMuremba highlighted that current alternatives to extending magistrates sentencing jurisdiction are often cumbersome, unclear, and may lack rationality depending on the circumstances.\n\nBy increasing the sentencing powers of magistrates, we can streamline the judicial process, reduce delays, and ensure that justice is served in a timely and fair manner, she stated.\n\nBoth Muremba and Mawadze asserted that this modification would foster consistency and uniformity in sentencing, ultimately bolstering public trust in the judicial system.\n\nI urge the legislature to consider this judgment and prioritise the necessary amendments to the Magistrates Court Act.\n\nAligning magistrates sentencing jurisdictions with the presumptive penalties will not only facilitate more effective sentencing but will also uphold the principles of justice and equity in our legal system.\n\nMuremba concluded that Referring such cases for sentencing to the High Court is a cumbersome process that delays the finalisation of these matters.\n\nThe court learned that Mufure and Murinda targeted five teachers at a primary school in the Norton farming area.\n\nThe two men had knocked on doors, forced the teachers to comply using a pellet gun, and stripped them of their belongings.\n\nSome victims were confined in their rooms during the ordeal.\n\nFollowing the robbery, they broke into the headmasters office and stole property valued at US$1,800.00, of which US$1,000.00 was recovered upon their arrest.\n\nAfter committing the crimes in Norton, the defendants hired a vehicle and travelled to Gokwe with the stolen items, where the recovered property was eventually located.\n\n",

This is not something you can attribute to a Natural Disaster or whats the impression they want to give is that predominantly its because of Kariba.\n\nThis is man-made. This is because of lagging in our planning and implementation of our energy projects.\n\nHowever, some sections of the society have dismissed the Shadow Ministers observations, describing them as cheap politicking contradicting the realities on the ground.\n\nFor instance, Zambia which shares the Kariba Dam has been experiencing acute power outages with consumers enjoying electricity for just three hours a day in a development which begs the question as to whether Zambians have also been bad energy planners.\n\n",

The ruling Zanu PF partys overbearing influence in districts and wards has largely resulted in the unfair allocation of aid, with those perceived to be opposition supporters being denied assistance, read the report.\n\nZimbabwe is currently reeling from drought, induced by the ElNino phenomenon. This year, the phenomenon destroyed crops that many households rely on forsurvival.\n\nIn April, President Emmerson Mnangagwa declared the drought a national disaster paving the way for food assistance.\n\nZPP said ZANU PF officials have been frogmarching community members to attend its party activities or risk losing food assistance.\n\nThe disregard of such constitutional fundamental freedoms is evident in various ways, including forced attendance at party meetings and mandatory allegiance to access food aid.\n\nIn some instances, members are forced to attend and chant party slogans and if they fail to comply they are denied the much-needed food aid and other government-sponsored support for their survival hence many comply grudgingly, read.\n\nRecently a ZANU PF member of parliament Wiriranai Muchemwa and Councillor Knowledge were arrested after stealing 40 tonnes of food aid worth US$12 000.\n\nZPP said the politicisationof food aid is a violation of the constitution.\n\nThe persistence of political discrimination in aid distribution not only undermines the principles of fairness and equality but also perpetuates the marginalization of already vulnerable populations.\n\nIt is essential that the government, through relevant departments such as the Social Welfare and Ministry of Agriculture, take immediate action to address these injustices and ensure that aid is distributed based on need, rather than political affiliation, read the report further.\n\n",

At first, l thought it was a haulage truck passing by, but l realised it was the ground shaking, said Felisha Mashoko of Nyamhunga township in Kariba.\n\nSome Kariba inhabitants were quick to point to folklore suggesting that the angry spirit of the river god Nyaminyami was manifesting.\n\nSeveral Karoi residents also confirmed the earth tremors.\n\nYes, l heard and felt the earth tremors. The experience was frightening, it was my first time going through such a rare occurrence, said David Hove of Buffalo Downs, Karoi.\n\nAccording to a report by Volcano Discovery, which cites data from the United States Geological Survey (USGS), a moderate magnitude 4.9 earthquake struck approximately 17 km South-Southeast of Kariba, in Mashonaland West Province, early on Monday morning. The quake occurred at a depth of 10km at 05:39 AM (Harare Time) on December 23.\n\nThe earthquake occurred just three days after a magnitude 4.6 quake struck 26 km southeast of the resort town of Kariba.\n\nEarthquakes are common in Kariba, primarily due to a phenomenon known as reservoir-induced seismicity.\n\nThis occurs because the immense weight of the water in the Kariba Dam exerts pressure on the local geological structures.\n\nWhen the dam was filled in the 1960s, it began to induce seismic activity in the region. The water load causes stress on the Earths crust, leading to frequent tremors.\n\nThese tremors are generally of low to moderate magnitude and have not been known to affect the dams structural integrity. However, they can still cause alarm among local residents.\n\nAlso, Earthquaketrack.com reported picking the seismic activity, which was also witnessed in Karoi, situated about 200 kilometres from Harare.\n\nEarthquakes and tremors are both seismic events, but they differ in intensity and impact.\n\nTremors are smaller, less intense seismic events that can be felt, but usually dont cause significant damage. Tremors can be caused by various factors, including minor tectonic activity, human activities like mining or construction, or even volcanic activity.\n\n",
