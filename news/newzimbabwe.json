Management is hopeful the Authorities will continue to intervene in this matter to promote fair competition in the operating environment, said the company.\n\nDuring the period, Farm & City Centre (FCC) sales volumes increased by 9% compared to the comparative period prior year on the back of the agro sectors rebound following the prior years drought.\n\nNotwithstanding increased competition, the entity continued to enjoy the fruits of mutually beneficial relations with its suppliers for key revenue drivers, which have continued to guarantee the businesss stability. The entity continues to implement enhanced product diversification strategies.\n\nIn the same reporting period, Agrifoods sales volumes increased by 13.9% during the quarter against a comparative prior year period, attributable to improved aggregate demand for its products.\n\nManagement remains focused on growing Agrifoods market share notwithstanding increased competition in the feed sector. The business remains responsive to evolving market dynamics and customer needs, with focused engagement and adaptive strategies deployed across operations.\n\nDuring the quarter, Victoria Foods sales volumes declined by 3% compared to the same period the prior year, influenced by grain shortages caused by the drought from the prior year and the late start of the maize harvest.\n\nGoing forward, the Group anticipates the FY2025 economic outturn to remain challenging, influenced by liquidity constraints and reduced aggregate demand. Ongoing cost containment measures will continue to be implemented, added CFI.\n\n",

The absence of law enforcement has turned bus ranks into zones of terror. Women and girls are no longer safe. The governments efforts to curb tout activity remain inconsistent and ineffective.\n\n",
