The informal process could lift confidence in the country and provide a stepping stone to restructuring a $21 billion debt pile thats kept it locked out of global financial markets since it defaulted in 1999.\n\nWhat is most important for us at this stage is to make sure that when authorities enter the program, they will exit a successfully completed program, he said. This requires a lot of effort, a lot time from both us and the authorities on the other side.\n\nZimbabwe, which has asked neighbouring South Africa for help in getting its debt reworked under the Group of 20 Common Framework, is trying to revive an economy wracked by years of mismanagement thats stoked hyperinflation and currency collapse.\n\nIt unveiled the gold-backed ZiG last year  its sixth attempt at creating a functioning local unit  and Maliszewski, the IMF Mission Chief for Zimbabwe since 2023, said establishing it as a fully-fledged currency would be welcome.\n\nLooking at the current macroeconomic situation comparing it to what the country was when I started my assignment and before, its massive progress, significant progress, he said.\n\n",

We have appointed consultants to do an evaluation of NDS 1 and their observations will serve as the base for NDS 2, which will be crafted following wide consultations, at the provincial and district levels. We should have a draft ready by October, said Ncube.\n\nAlthough Ncube emphasised that as NDS 1 approaches its end in December 2025, Zimbabwe remains solidly on track to attain an upper-middle-income society status, poverty and unemployment remain widespread among the general populace. The nation is reeling from a liquidity crunch amid a faltering Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) currency.\n\nNcube said NDS 2 will serve as the crucial five-year plan to leapfrog the country towards the ambitious Vision 2030, by which Zimbabwe will attain upper-middle-class society status.\n\nNcube said chairpersons of 10 national priorities that will underpin the strategy were hitting the ground running to contribute to the national document.\n\nThe final document is expected to be tabled by November 2025, ahead of the National Budget presentation. Thereafter, it will be officially launched by the President.\n\nFollowing NDS 2s launch, Ncube said there will be public awareness campaigns by amplifiers to extensively disseminate its contents so that there is buy-in for the important national blueprint.\n\n",

Many of those actions have been blocked by US courts.\n\nAmong the institutions scrutinised by the president is Harvard University, which had $2.65bn (1.96bn) in federal grants frozen.\n\nTrump has also tried to revoke Harvards ability to enrol international students, though that move has been temporarily blocked by a federal judge while the matter is being heard in court.\n\nMore than 1.1 million international students from over 210 countries were enrolled in US colleges in the 2023-24 school year, according to Open Doors, an organisation that collects data on foreign students.\n\n",
