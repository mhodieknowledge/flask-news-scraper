This programme focuses on repairing a significant portion of the road network, aiming to improve safety, stimulate economic activity, and connect communities to essential services like health, education, and markets.\n\nTo date, major road uplifts have been undertaken along the countrys major highways to revamp the countrys roads infrastructure.\n\nIn a statement, the MoTID announced that Glenara Road will not be accessible due to ongoing works.\n\nThe MoTID wishes to notify the motoring public and residents of the temporary partial closure of a section of Glenara Road to facilitate essential road rehabilitation works.\n\nAs part of the governments ongoing road infrastructure rehabilitation programme, this project aims to enhance road safety drainage and travel conditions for all users, said the ministry in a statement.\n\nThe affected section of Genara Road is between Service Station and Samora Machel Avenue will be partially closed to through traffic.\n\nMotorists travelling from ED Mnangagwa Road were advised to follow the designated detour, which proceeds via Glen Roy, turns onto Sloane Street, continues on Montgomery Road, then onto Rhodesville Avenue and finally rejoins Glenara Road via Samora Machel Avenue.\n\nProperties within the construction zone will remain accessible, with traffic management personnel on site to assist residents and businesses. To ensure the safety of all motorists and construction personnel and facilitate a smooth flow of traffic, the ministry strongly advises the public to obey all posted traffic signs and instruction from officials, drive with caution and at reduced speeds through the affected area, and allow for extra travel time to their schedules, the ministry added.\n\n",

A very positive and productive one, Zelenskyy said on Facebook, congratulating Trump for his outstanding ceasefire plan in the Middle East.If a war can be stopped in one region, then surely other wars can be stopped as well, including the Russian war, Zelenskyy added, calling for Trump to pressure the Kremlin into negotiations.Relations between the two leaders have warmed dramatically since February when they sparred during a televised meeting at the White House.Trump has since grown more hostile towards Russia while expressing sympathy for Ukraine.In September, he wrote on Truth Social that Kyiv should try to take back all its occupied territory with Europes and NATOs help.US first lady Melania Trump said on Friday that she had secured the release of Ukrainian children abducted by Russia after establishing an extraordinary back channel of communication with Putin.Russian attacks on Ukraine killed at least five people on Saturday and cut power to parts of southern Ukraines Odesa region, according to Ukrainian officials.Two of the people died inside a church in Kostyantynivka when it was hit by a strike, according to local authorities.Ukraines largest private energy company, DTEK, said the main work to restore the power supply was completed but some localised outages were still affecting the Ukrainian capital after Fridays massive Russian attacks.Ukrainian drone attacks, meanwhile, killed two people in Russia, according to regional officials.In the Russian border region of Belgorod, a truck driver was killed by a Ukrainian strike, according to local officials.Russia has targeted Ukraines energy grid each winter since it launched its full-scale invasion in 2022, cutting power and heating to millions of households and disrupting water supplies in what Kyiv says is a brazen war crime.Russia denies targeting civilians and says Ukraine uses the energy sites to power its military sector.Both countries have accused each other in recent months of frustrating progress towards a peace deal.Russia blames Ukraine and its European allies for the impasse, accusing them of undermining peace negotiations with Washington. Ukraine and Europe accuse Russia of playing for time so it can seize more Ukrainian territory.Zelenskyy said in his nightly address on Friday that Russia was taking advantage of the world being almost entirely focused on the prospect of establishing peace in the Middle East and called for strengthening Ukraines air defence systems and placing tighter sanctions on Russia.Russian assets must be fully used to strengthen our defence and ensure recovery, he said in the video, posted to X.\n\nSaturdays call came a day after Russia launched a large-scale attack on Ukraines energy grid, knocking out power to parts of the capital, Kyiv, and nine other Ukrainian regions, which have since been restored.\n\nDiplomatic efforts to end Russias invasion of Ukraine have slowed in recent weeks, in part because global attention has shifted to brokering a ceasefire in Israels war on Gaza, Kyiv said.Trump, who announced the first phase of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas on Wednesday, met Russian President Vladimir Putin for talks in August but failed to secure progress on a ceasefire in the European war.I had a call with US President Donald Trump.

I cannot tell you how unbearably sad this makes me.She was hilarious, a complete original, and completely without guile, or any of the competitiveness one would have expected from such a star. What you saw was who she was  oh, la, lala!Fellow First Wives Club co-star Goldie Hawn said Keaton left a trail of fairy dust, filled with particles of light and memories beyond imagination.Writing on Instagram, Hawn said: How do we say goodbye? What words can come to mind when your heart is broken? You never liked praise, so humble, but now you cant tell me to shut up honey. There was, and will be, no one like you.Steve Martin, who starred with Keaton in Father of the Bride alongside Martin Short, reposted part of a magazine article where Short asks: Whos sexier, me or Steve Martin?Keaton replies: I mean, youre both idiots.Martin said: Dont know who first posted this, but it sums up our delightful relationship with Diane.Actor Ben Stiller paid tribute on X, writing: Diane Keaton.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nAS the Zanu PF annual conference kicks off this week, the ruling party is urging discipline within its rank-and-file amid social media claims alleging plans to heckle Vice President Constantino Chiwenga during the event, as the succession debate intensifies.\n\nChiwenga is widely regarded as the frontrunner to succeed President Emmerson Mnangagwa in 2028 when his second term expires. However, his path to the presidencywhile seemingly straightforwardis reportedly being obstructed by Mnangagwas loyalists, who are pushing for an extension of the Presidents tenure to 2030.\n\nAmong these loyalists is a group of controversial business figures, including convicted businessman Wicknell Chivayo, Paul Tungwarara, and Kudakwashe Tagwirei, who have publicly and repeatedly pledged to support Mnangagwas continued leadership beyond 2028.\n\nIn recent days, social media has been awash with claims that Zanu PF youths are being bussed to Mutare, Manicaland province, for the sole purpose of booing Chiwengaa development seen as a sign that the succession battle is escalating.\n\nZanu PF Director of Communication, Farai Marapira, dismissed the allegations, insisting that the partys conference would not be used to heckle senior leaders, as attendance is restricted to vetted delegates.\n\nWe are not going to a rally. We are going to a conference. This is not a free for all. This is a meeting of delegates. This is a meeting of leadership. There is no time to heckle. This is just once again social media trying its best to push agendas on us as Zanu PF. But of course it will fail, he said.\n\nMarapira further stated that those promoting claims of planned disruption were ignorant of the partys internal procedures.\n\nThis issue of being bussed to boo, how are they going to enter when they are not accredited? We are not accrediting crowds, we are accrediting delegates. This is mischief being created by people who are ignorant of the ways of the party and how it conducts its conferences, Marapira said.\n\nThe alleged plans to heckle Chiwenga come against the backdrop of his sustained stance against corruption, which he has consistently described as a threat to national security. Chiwenga has publicly condemned prominent businessmenamong them Chivayo, Tungwarara, Tagwirei, and Delish Nguwayathough without naming them directly, referring instead to the group as Zvigananda a deragatory term for plunderers.\n\nLast month, Chiwenga reportedly presented a detailed corruption dossier during a Zanu PF Politburo meeting, implicating Nguwaya, Chivayo, Tagwirei, and Tungwarara. Analysts claim the dossier was so damaging that President Mnangagwa had to abandon his planned trip to the United States, where he was scheduled to lead Zimbabwes campaign for a non-permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council.\n\n",
