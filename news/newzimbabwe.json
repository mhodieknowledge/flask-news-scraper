Just recently, mineral exporting companies revealed that the central bank has not been paying their 30% export surrender in local currency.\n\nThe latest decision by Bitumen Worlddemonstrates the authorities appetite to uphold currency stability even at the cost of other critical economic imperatives.\n\nThe Zimbabwean government, one of the companys largest debtors, is experiencing significant challenges in making timely payments to its contractors. The government is facing delays in settling arrears, affecting various projects, including road rehabilitation and dam construction.\n\nWhile efforts are underway to establish payment plans and small payments have been received, these financial constraints have contributed to the companys decision to realign its operations to remain resilient in a challenging fiscal environment, said the company.\n\nThe company said this necessary transition reflects a committed effort to adapt to the current economic challenges, including operating under cash flow pressures caused by delayed payments from clients.\n\nBW said it recognises and deeply values the dedication and professionalism of all its employees and is committed to handling the process with respect, transparency, and dignity, offering support to those affected through severance packages and transition assistance.\n\nBW CEO, Andre Zietsman, said the decision has been very tough but had to be made due to limited options at hand.\n\nOver recent months, we have engaged in extensive discussions and evaluations to guide Bitumen World through this difficult period. While the decision to restructure was not made lightly, it is essential for ensuring our long-term viability and ability to continue contributing meaningfully to infrastructure development in Zimbabwe and beyond, he said.\n\nHe said the employees who have worked tirelessly to restore the countrys infrastructure glory will, unfortunately, suffer heavy blows when they see their jobs going down the drain.\n\nThe tragedy of these layoffs is that they impact the very people who built this prestigious brand  a brand that was wholly created by Zimbabweans, said Zietsman.\n\nThe company committed to handling the process with respect, transparency, and dignity, offering support to those affected through severance packages and transition assistance.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nOPPOSITION legislator Zivai Mhetu has urged the government to scrap passport requirements for countries within the SADC region in order to promote trade, tourism, and labour mobility.\n\nMhetu told Speaker Jacob Mudenda during a point of national interest on Tuesday that Zimbabwe and its neighbours should adopt a system similar to the European Schengen visa, which allows free travel between member states using only ID cards.\n\nSchengen countries in Europe have boosted trade and mobility through the introduction of the Schengen visa, enabling citizens to travel freely within member states using just ID cards. Closer to home, Namibia and Zambia have recently implemented a similar system, removing the need for passports when travelling between their countries,the Epworth South MP said.\n\nHe further argued that such agreements would ease immigration challenges faced by Zimbabweans and other nationalities living in SADC countries without proper documentation.\n\nFollowing these developments, my prayer is that Zimbabwe does the same to enhance trade, tourism, and labour mobility, while advancing intra-African commerce in line with the African Continental Free Trade Area and SADCs vision of free movement. I urge government to pursue similar agreements with neighbours such as Mozambique, Botswana, Zambia, Malawi, Namibia, and South Africa, to allow our citizens to travel, work, and trade more freely, thereby strengthening both economic opportunities and regional unity, he added.\n\nIn response, Lands Minister Masuka said the government was currently engaging Botswana on the issue, with plans to have the same arrangement with more countries across Africa.\n\nMasuka could, however, not provide a timeline for when the discussions will be concluded, citing that the negotiations involve others (countries), hence deadlines cannot be imposed.\n\nI know that there are current discussions with Botswana, for example, to ensure that movement is enhanced. You will recall that we already have a UniVisa for the KAZA area. So, such negotiations with other countries will continue.\n\nI hope that, eventually, the citizens of African countries will be able to travel freely to the 54 African nations. We have made a start to gather momentum in order to accelerate this regional integration that is already in motion and led by our President, he said.\n\n",

Minister of Finance, and the matter is being handled. What is outstanding at the moment, what was paid for and other urgent matters where members were behind, including coupons, is ZWL1.5 million and what we, as Parliament, had indicated to bring all the requirements up to date, we needed ZWL5 million.\n\nI was assured that the balance of ZWL3.5 million should be paid before the end of this month.
