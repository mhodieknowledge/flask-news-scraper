            "content": "SowetanLive\n\nA South African soldier on border patrol has been trampled to death by a herd of elephants in Limpopo near Zimbabwe.\n\nThe incident happened on Sunday night near the banks of the Limpopo River in Musina, about 300m from the SANDFs Madimbo operational base.\n\nPrivate Xavier Raynard was doing routine patrols on the Malala Drift road when he was killed.\n\nThe SANDF went to collect his remains on Monday.\n\nSANDF spokesperson Prince Tshabalala said Raynard, a member of the 10 Anti-Aircraft Regiment, who was deployed under Operation Corona,was found dead near the base.\n\nEarly indications suggest that he may have been fatally trampled by a herd of elephants while conducting routine patrols in the area. His service weapon was recovered at the scene.\n\nThe matter is under investigation by SANDF authorities in co-operation with environmental and wildlife officials to determine the exact circumstances surrounding the incident. A formal board of inquiry has been initiated, said Tshabalala.\n\nTshabalala said Raynards next of kin, from Kimberley, Northern Cape, have been formally notified, and psychosocial support is being provided to the family and his unit members.\n\nOperation Corona is a national border safeguarding initiative aimed at combating transnational crimes along the countrys borders.\n\nTshabalala said that soldiers deployed in these operations face harsh terrain, isolation and exposure to unpredictable natural conditions.\n\nLauren Liebenberg from the Vhembe Biosphere Reserve said:At this time of year, the crisis with the elephant populations that roam the Limpopo River Valley intensifies.When elephant hunting starts in the dry season they come across the Limpopo River [into SA] in huge numbers, she said, adding that the elephants neededa well-managed migration corridor.\n\nThe problem extends along the whole length of the 200km strip between Mapungubwe and Kruger National Park. We become a massive human-wildlife conflict zone.\n\nLiebenberg said a programme by the US Agency for International Development to manage the problem collapsed after the US administration cancelled it earlier this year.\n\nThrough the programme, they trained elephant herders and provided all sorts of defence interventions.\n\nDeaths still remain rare and at the extreme end of the human wildlife conflict interface, but the elephants do massive damage to crops, to infrastructure  especially fencing and water infrastructure, and to the natural vegetation in the nature reserves, said Liebenberg.\n\n",

            "content": "Bloomberg\n\nZimbabwes best chance of exiting a 25-year debt default is to engage the Group of 20 nations to help formulate a solution and stop trying to work its way out of the quagmire itself, World Bank President Ajay Banga said.\n\nThe southern African country owes the World Bank and other creditors a total of $21 billion and has tried numerous unsuccessful strategies to restore its access to global capital markets. Those ranged from attempting to repay its debts using the proceeds of metal sales and recently approaching 10 nations for help to raise $2.6 billion to pay its arrears.\n\nAjay Banga. Image: Bloomberg\n\nTrying to figure it out on your own, youll be doing this for the next five years, Banga said in an interview in Maputo, Mozambiques capital. They need to figure out a way to reach out to the G20 and say, we raise our hand, wed like to be part of this process.\n\nZimbabwe first defaulted on repayments to the World Bank in 2000. Its debts to a host of multilateral institutions and bilateral lenders mounted amid a failed land-reform program and a quarter century of economic turmoil, shutting it out of international debt markets and limiting its ability to borrow even during the global pandemic and a recent devastating drought.\n\nThe government has asked the African Development Bank to advise on clearing its debt with the institutions outgoing president, Akinwumi Adesina, and former Mozambican President Joaquim Chissano asked to negotiate with creditors. It also hired Global Sovereign Advisory, a Paris-based consultancy, to help. The fact that Zimbabwean officials, including President Emmerson Mnangagwa, have been sanctioned by the US has complicated the process.\n\nWhile Belarus, Syria and Eritrea are also in arrears to the World Bank, Zimbabwes default is by far the longest. South Africa, which currently holds the G-20 presidency, last month said it has been approached by Zimbabwe to try and garner the groups support for a debt workout.\n\nZambia, Ghana and Ethiopia are among nations that have employed the G20s Common Framework, which was created in 2020 to help poor nations bring together a diverse set of creditors to restructure debts. While they have made progress in reaching deals, the process has been criticized for being too slow.\n\nZimbabwe isnt technically poor enough to be eligible to utilise the framework, yet Sri Lanka  a nation in a similar situation  approached the group in 2023 for help with dealing with its creditors.\n\nStart talking to the G20 and the Paris Club and whoever else has given them money and we can help, Banga said. We try and bring an understanding of what write down you need to take. It takes a while.\n\nZimbabwes Treasury didnt respond to a request for comment.\n\n",
