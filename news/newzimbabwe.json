beat Kwekwe United 1-0 at Bata Stadium.\n\nNavayas 88th minute strike saw him stretching his lead on the top goalscorers chart as he is now on nine goals, one ahead of MWOS Billy Vheremu, who is now on eight goals.Vheremu was on target Saturday for MWOS, which salvaged a 1-1 draw from behind in Chisumbanje against Green Fuel FC.The result saw MWOS extending its unbeaten run to 13 games, a record they are sharing with former champions FC Platinum, who were held to a 0-0 draw by Yadah FC at The Heart Stadium.Commenting after Saturdays game, MWOS FC coach Lloyd Mutasa applauded his boys character.The never-die attitude in these boys is what l should appreciate, they fought when we were 1-0 down and we got our goal.Although we had a chance we could have scored but such is football we take a point going back home, he said.Elsewhere, at Baobab Stadium, Dynamos failed to keep a one nill lead against the host Ngezi Platinum Stars, who eventually grabbed a 2- 1 win.The result saw

I lost everything I believed in. I slept on sofas.I continued with dignity and went on.There are so many wars, so many inequalities, so much discrimination. Reading is enriched by the immigrants who are here.
