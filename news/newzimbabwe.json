SAPS is investigating, with the Family Violence, Child Protection, and Sexual Investigations (FCS) unit taking the lead.\n\nThis follows the release of number of videos, showing security personnel using excessive force  allegedly at the club  against suspects linked to phone thefts, prompting a widespread condemnation of the actions captured on tape.\n\nPolice had urged victims and witnesses to come forward, and three individuals, out of a group of five friends who had been assaulted, have reported incidents of abuse at the Brooklyn police station.\n\nThe victims recounted harrowing experiences that further substantiated the claims circulating online. The SAPS revealed that they are currently investigating serious charges, including compelled rape, assault, crimen injuria, intimidation, and kidnapping.\n\nAuthorities have flagged these incidents as severe human rights violations, with allegations ranging from kidnapping to sexual assault and attempted murder.\n\nAt the centre of the unfolding situation, a former nightclub bouncer named Pablo  believed to have released the videos  has come forward, claiming to possess crucial evidence for the investigation.\n\nHe claims that he holds more than 75 additional videos revealing the dark activities within Zanzou.\n\nEverything is true. Everything is 100% true, he said.\n\nPablo further elaborated on fatal incidents at the club and revealed that he has received death threats due to his knowledge of the clubs operations.\n\nMeanwhile, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) held a picket outside the nightclub, demanding the arrest of the owner and the establishments closure. Zanzou Management has acknowledged the incidents and dismissed the involved security personnel.\n\nThe National Commissioner of the South African Police Service (SAPS), General Fannie Masemola, has instructed the Provincial Commissioner of Gauteng, Lieutenant General Tommy Mthombeni, to swiftly pursue those implicated.\n\nThe Department of Justice and Constitutional Development has also expressed strong condemnation of the actions revealed in the videos, labelling them as a gross infringement of the human rights enshrined in South Africas Constitution.\n\nIn a statement, the department called for a decisive and urgent response from law enforcement agencies, insisting that all those complicit in these violations be held accountable.\n\nIn response to the unfolding scandal, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) held a picket outside the nightclub, demanding the immediate arrest of Stephane Cohen, alleged as the the clubs owner, and calling for the establishments closure.\n\nThe party expressed its outrage at the reported dehumanisation of individuals, insisting that no justification exists for the violence depicted in the videos.\n\nThe City of Tshwane, and indeed South Africa, is a democratic state, with the rule of law and respect for human rights, the EFF declared.\n\nWe reject any attempt by management to shift blame onto security personnel.\n\nThe organisation Not in My Name has expressed its sorrow over the violence that transpired within Zanzou, echoing calls for justice to be pursued rigorously.\n\nIn a statement released yesterday, Zanzou Management acknowledged awareness of the troubling videos depicting violent security responses to theft.\n\nThey claimed that upon becoming aware of such practices, they initiated an immediate investigation, resulting in the dismissal of the implicated security personnel.\n\nZanzou Management is aware of the circulation of disturbing historical videos that depict security personnel employing excessive and violent force in response to incidents of phone theft by the individuals therein. At the time when management became aware of these practices, an immediate investigation was conducted, which resulted in the immediate halting of such as well as the dismissal of security personnel responsible for the perpetration thereof, the statement read.\n\nIn a swift response to a series of distressing videos that have circulated on social media, Zanzou Management has taken decisive action following the exposure of security personnel employing excessive force against individuals suspected of phone theft. The troubling footage has sparked outrage among patrons and the wider community, prompting urgent intervention from the nightclubs leadership. Picture: Screenshot\n\n",

He refused to give it to me, saying it was an instruction from the Town Clerk. He then showed me the document in confidence, and from what I saw, the highest-paid executive is receiving US$27,000.\n\nMafume added that the lowest-paid member of the executive is taking home a handsome US$15,000.\n\nCommission lead evidence Thabani Mpofu asked Mafume to confirm that these hefty salaries did not include any additional benefits, to which Mafume replied in the affirmative, adding that with other perks factored in, the total remuneration would likely tip the scales at over US$30,000.\n\nJustice Cheda then probed Mafume further, questioning why he seemed to lack the authority to curb the lavish spending of the executive, to which he responded that executives are always quick to remind him that he is not an executive mayor and therefore his power is limited.\n\nJustice Cheda further inquired about the current relationship between the City Council executive and the councillors, which Mafume described as not harmonious.\n\nMafume was also grilled about the proliferation of service stations in residential areas, some of which Harare City Councils Town Planning Director, Samuel Nyabeza, has pledged to demolish because they pose serious safety issues to residents.\n\nHe was further taken to task over the non-functional traffic lights in Harare, which have contributed significantly to traffic accidents, some of which have tragically claimed lives.\n\n",

I did most of my grieving while we were together. I finally got the courage to leave. And of course, I wish him the best, she wrote.\n\nThe pair who dated for five years and became one of the most popular couples in SA during that time, have now buried the hatchet, yet again.\n\nDont ask!! he didnt entertain my rubbish.We are adults!!!

Love you always. No going back. We will never end, Mushonga wrote on his Instagram account, which has since been deactivated.\n\nMbau flees Dubai: August 2021\n\nA couple of months went by as the pair served couple goals. They continued to share loved-up snaps right until Mushonga set the country in a panic when he claimed that he was unable to locate Mbau in Dubai after dropping her off at a salon.\n\nThe actor was on the trends list, with some genuinely worried about her whereabouts.\n\nHowever, Mbau later in an Instagram post,revealed that she was in Johannesburg, posting a photo of herself at her fathers grave, dispelling allegations that she went missing.\n\nMbau cleared the air with News24, saying she was home safe and sound after her partner expressed concern on Instagram.\n\nI am home safe and sound. I am so sorry to have worried and stressed the country, my fans, friends, relatives and family.

They relocated to Dubai, with hope of building an empire together.\n\nWhile the true nature of their love can only be confirmed by the pair, the years 2022 to 2023 were lived away from the spotlight, with Mbau occasionally offering a glimpse into her relationship when she was doing interviews for new projects.\n\nAfter her debut on Young, Famous & African in 2022, the actor spoke of being in a loving relationship with Mushonga despite their seven-year age gap.\n\nTrouble in paradise? 2023/2024\n\nIn the last episode of season three of the reality show, Mbau confirmed cracks in her relationship with Mushonga.\n\nIn a scene where she engaged with Naked DJ and offered advice about his relationship, the Metro FM DJ questions Mbau silence and why she was portraying a happy relationship with Mushonga on social media.\n\nMbau revealed she had burnout but did not offer any information of the current state of her relationship.\n\nThe end of the road: 3 February 2025\n\nAfter nearly 5 years, Mbau announced that she had broken up with her boyfriend and said it had been a long time coming.\n\nHe was a good guy, but he did some bad things; he tried everything he could to make it up to me.

This is despite Mnangagwa maintaining that he will abide by the constitution and step down in 2028.\n\nAddressing journalists at State House on Monday, Mnangagwa refuted allegations that he is providing Chivayo with funds to splash around the country at a time when the economy and social services are on their knees.\n\nWhere would I get the money to give him? he questioned.\n\nInvestigate where you think Im getting the money to give Chivayo to distribute, rather than wasting my time worrying about someone who is using his own money.

Translated, this term implies someone who engages in dubious deals at the expense of others.\n\nVision 2030 is for all of us, not those you refer to asmbinga. During the liberation struggle, we referred to those aszvigananda.\n\nTo add fuel to the fire, Chivayo has publicly voiced his support on X (formerly Twitter) for Mnangagwas presidential term extension, arguing that the Zanu-PF leaders vision must be supported, not derailed.\n\nOutspoken Zanu-PF Central Committee member and war veteran Blessed Geza, now hunted by the police after his explosive press conference demanding Mnangagwas resignation (chiefly due to corruption), has also turned his ire towards Chivayo.\n\nGeza questioned the provenance of Chivayos seemingly limitless wealth, implicitly pointing the finger at Mnangagwa, suggesting his actions are merely to divert attention.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nLEADING retailer Ok Zimbabwe says the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwes (RBZ) decision to devalue the ZWG currency doubled the entitys US$-denominated loans and credits.\n\nThe supermarket chain is currently reeling under pressure to keep its heads above water as most shelves have gone empty without any stocks. At the heart of the problems is supplier resistance to offering commodities, which are often paid for in local currency.\n\nThe situation has led many suppliers to channel their commodities to the informal market, which often enjoys easy access to the much-needed greenback.\n\nPresenting a trading update for the third quarter period, OK Zimbabwes group company secretary, Margaret Munyuru, bemoaned the impact of the central banks decisions.\n\nThe local currency unit (ZWG) experienced a sharp devaluation at the end of September 2024 as monetary authorities sought to improve the viability of the exchange rate system for the broader economy. Invariably, the devaluation had the net effect of nearly doubling existing US Dollar denominated obligations in loans and creditors balances, she said.\n\nIn September 2024,the RBZdevalued the ZWG currency by 43%to keep pace with exchange rate premiums which had seen the official rate at the time stuck at ZWG13,80 when the parallel market rate had gravitated to a premium of ZWG30 against the greenback.\n\nThe move effectively worsened most retailers and companies balance sheets as they now had to pay more for their debts.\n\nMunyuru said during the period, the group had outstanding and overdue creditorsbalances which were predominantly denominated in US$ sales collection.\n\nShe attributed the low stocking levels to the direct manifestation of sub-economic pricing arising out of exchange rate distortions and suppliers need for foreign currency invoicing to cover their operational and raw material needs.\n\nResultantly, volumes during the period decreased by 36% in comparison to the same period last year. The reduction for the quarter also translated to a 36% revenue decline.\n\nDespite the challenges, the business has since begun to restock with support from suppliers as well as financial institutions that continue to assist with short-term funding structures.\n\nNew alternative procurement models have been developed which include, but are not limited to, a structured stock supply arrangement with a third party for supplier assurance purposes as the business works to restore critical supply relationships with both local and foreign suppliers.\n\nThe fortunes of the countrys formal retail sector hinge on the stability of our exchange rate regime. There is a need for absolute clarity on the roadmap towards a full market-determined exchange rate system. Such a liberalized system will go a long way in restoring the competitiveness of the formal retail sector, added Munyuru.\n\n",

            "content": "The Conversation\n\nHate speech on X was consistently 50% higher for at least eight months after tech billionaire Elon Musk bought the social media platform, new research has found.\n\nThe research looked at the prevalence of overt hate speech including a wide range of racist, homophobic and transphobic slurs.\n\nThe study,published today in PLOS ONE, was conducted by a team of researchers led by Daniel Hickney from the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nIt clearly demonstrates how a platform initiallyinvented to help friends and family stay in touchhas now metamorphosed into a place where hate speech is prolific. This is especially concerning givenhate speech online has been linkedto violent hate crimes offline.\n\nOn October 27 2022, Musk officially purchased X (then known as Twitter) for US$44 billion and became its CEO. His takeover was accompanied by promises toreduce hate speechon the platform andtackle botsand other inauthentic accounts.\n\nBut after he bought X, Musk made several changes to the platform to reduce content moderation. For example,in November 2022 he firedmuch of the companys full time workforce. He also fired outsourced content moderators who tracked abuse on X, despite research showing social medial platforms with high levels of content moderationcontain less hate speech.\n\nThe following month,Musk also disbanded the platforms Trust and Safety Council a volunteer advisory group of independent human rights leaders and academics formed in 2016 to fight hate speech and other problems on the platform.\n\nPrevious researchhas shownhate speech increased on X immediately afterMusk took over. So too did the prevalence of most types of bots.\n\nThis new study is the first to show that this wasnt an anomaly.\n\nThe study examined 4.7 million English language posts on X from the beginning of 2022 through to June 9 2023. This period includes the ten months before Musk bought X and the eight months afterwards.\n\nThe study measured overt hate speech, the meaning of which was clear to anyone who saw it  speech attacking identity groups or using toxic language. It did not measure covert types of hate speech, such ascoded language used by some extremist groupsto spread hate but plausibly deny doing so.\n\nAs well as measuring the amount of hate speech on X, the study also measured how much other users engaged with this material by liking it.\n\nThe researchers access to X data was cut off during the study due to a policy change by the platform, replacing free access to approved academic researchers with payment options which are generally unaffordable. This significantly hampered their ability to collect sample posts. But they dont mention whether it affected their results.\n\nThe study found a clear increase in the average number of posts containing hate speech following Musks purchase of X. Specifically, the volume of posts containing hate speech was consistently 50% higher after Musk took over X compared to beforehand  a jump from an estimated average of 2,179 to 3,246 posts containing hate speech per week.\n\nTransphobic slurs saw the highest increase, rising from an average of roughly 115 posts per week before Musks acquisition to an average of 418 afterwards.\n\nThe level of user engagement with posts containing hate speech also increased under Musks watch. For example, the weekly rate at which hate speech content was liked by users jumped by 70%.\n\nThe researchers say these results suggest either hate speech wasnt taken down, hateful users became more active, the platforms algorithm unintentionally promoted hate speech to users who like such content  or a combination of these possibilities.\n\nThe study also detected no decrease in the activity of inauthentic accounts on X. In fact, it found a potential increase in the number of bot accounts partly based on a large upswing in posts promoting cryptocurrency, which are typically associated with bots.\n\nThere were a number of limitations to the study. For example, it only measured hate speech posts in English, which accounts foronly 31% of postson the platform.\n\nEven so, the study is an important, data-driven deep dive into the state of X. It shows it is a platform where hate speech is prolific. It also shows Musk has failed to fulfil his earlier promises to address problems on X such as hate speech and bot activity.\n\nAsMusk himself saidat the White House earlier this week: Some of the things I say will be incorrect and should be corrected.\n\nAssociate professor, Institute for Governance and Policy Analysis, University of Canberra, University of Canberra\n\nThis article is republished fromThe Conversationunder a Creative Commons license.Read the original articlehere.\n\n",
