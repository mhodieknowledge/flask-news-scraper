The demand for social protection, food assistance, and resilience-building continues to grow and central to delivering these services is reliable mobility, ensuring that officials and teams can reach every corner of the country quickly, safely, and effectively.\n\nThese nine vehicles are therefore an investment in delivery capacity. They will support the ministry in monitoring programmes, reaching vulnerable communities, and ensuring that national social protection and food assistance systems are stronger, faster, and more responsive. In this way, becoming tools of service and impact, added Clemens.\n\nIn addition to the vehicles, WFP also donated digital media equipment to aid the ministrys communications work as documenting progress, sharing stories, and enhancing visibility were equally vital in strengthening accountability and mobilising support.\n\nAs he received the keys to one of the vehicles for a test drive, Moyo said, It is with great pleasure that we gather here to receive yet another post from the World Food Programme in the form of vehicles.\n\nThe minister remains grateful for the support that the World Food Programme continues to render in this commitment to the people of Zimbabwe in ensuring food security goals are met.\n\nWe continue to make a difference in the delivery of social protection services in the ministry, Moyo said.\n\nHe commended WFP for the provision of support to the government and empowering its staff in the districts where it is present.\n\nIt has been noted that in all the districts that you have provided support, the staff are more empowered in claim distribution, supply chain management and logistical arrangements.\n\nThe ministry desires that you continue to spread this knowledge across the other districts we have not yet implemented. As we jointly implement the food deficit mitigation strategy, we insist on assistance.\n\nMoyo highlighted, We noted gaps, and I am glad that we are here today to pluck one of those gaps through motorisation of the department. You have helped me accept the main variables, which will go a long way to support our social protection programs and facilitate program implementation, enabling the ministry to meet its targets as we look forward to completing the implementation of NTS1 and getting NTS2 towards vision 2030.\n\nSaid Moyo: We rest assured that the ministry will ensure that these variables are put to good use and managed according to government policies and regulations. Priorities shall be given to the hard-to-reach areas, considering terrain in a bid to leave no one and no place behind. May I, on behalf of the Government of Zimbabwe, take this opportunity to thank the World Food Programme for its continued support.\n\n",

Both the house and the vehicle have since been forfeited to the State.\n\nThe court said deterrent penalties in cases of insider fraud would serve justice.\n\nConvicted white-collar criminals will face stiff penalties and ill-got wealth will be forfeited, the National Prosecuting Authority said, commenting on the conviction.\n\n",
