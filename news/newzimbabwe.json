            "content": "Al Jazeera\n\nUS President Donald Trump and officials from his administration have hinted that they might consider revoking the US citizenship ofZohran Mamdani, New York Citys Democratic mayoral candidate.\n\nSeparately, Trump said former aideElon Muskwould have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa amid a row over histax breaks and Trumps narrowly passed spending bill.\n\nBut would the Trump administration have the power to revoke the citizenship of Mamdani and Musk, both foreign-born, naturalised citizens of the US?\n\nMamdani, 33, was born in the Ugandan capital, Kampala, to ethnically Indian parents. He moved to New York at the age of seven and became a naturalised US citizen in 2018.\n\nMusk was born in 1971 in Pretoria, South Africa to a Canadian mother and South African father. At the age of 17, he moved to Canada of where he is also a citizen. In 1992, he moved to the US to study at the University of Pennsylvania. He became a naturalised US citizen in 2002, according to a biography of him written in 2023 by journalist Walter Isaacson.\n\nIn October 2024, the Washington Post reported that Musk began his career in the US without the proper work authorisation, but Musk has denied this. I was in fact allowed to work in the US, Musk wrote in an X post on the same day the report was published. I was on a J-1 visa that transitioned to an H1-B, Musk wrote in another post. A J-1 visa is a temporary visa for foreign students, while an H-1B is a temporary work visa.\n\nTo become naturalised as a US citizen, an individual needs to be above the age of 18 and to have lived continuously in the US as a green card holder for five years, or three years if they are married to a US citizen.\n\nAndy Ogles, a Republican Tennessee representative, wrote to Attorney General Pam Bondi on June 26, asking for the Department of Justice to probe whether Mamdani, who identifies as ademocratic socialist, should be subject to denaturalisation proceedings.\n\nPosting a copy of the letter to Bondi on his X page, Ogles wrote: Zohran little muhammad Mamdani is an antisemitic, socialist, communist who will destroy the great City of New York. He needs to be DEPORTED. Which is why I am calling for him to be subject to denaturalization proceedings.\n\nOgles said that the investigation should be conducted on the grounds that Mamdani may have procured US citizenship through willful misrepresentation or concealment of material support for terrorism.\n\nThe Tennessee Republican cited reports, including an article published in the New York Post, stating that Mamdani expressed solidarity with individuals convicted of terrorism-related offenses prior to becoming a US citizen. Ogles said that Mamdani rapped Free the Holy Land Five / My guys.\n\nThe Holy Land Foundation was convicted in 2008 for providing material support to Hamas, a designated foreign terrorist organization. Publicly praising the Foundations convicted leadership as my guys raises serious concerns about whether Mr. Mamdani held affiliations or sympathies he failed to disclose during the naturalization process, Ogles wrote in his letter to Bondi.\n\nMoreover, Mr. Mamdani has recently refused opportunities to reject the pro-terrorist rallying cry to globalize the intifada a call to expand violent attacks on civilians to the United States and around the world, Ogles wrote.\n\nMamdani has also pledged to stop masked Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents from deporting our neighbours. When Trump was asked about this on Tuesday at a news conference, he said that if Mamdani prevents ICE agents from conducting deportation operations, Well, then, well have to arrest him.\n\nWe dont need a communist in this country, but if we have one, Im going to be watching over him very carefully on behalf of the nation, Trump said, adding, well send him money, well send him all the things he needs to run the government.\n\nTrump continued, citing claims that Mamdani is in the US illegally, saying, Were going to look at everything. The president also voiced support for the current New York mayor, Eric Adams, who is also a member of the Democratic Party.\n\nMamdani posted a statement on his X account in response to Trumps comments on Tuesday.\n\nThe President of the United States just threatened to have me arrested, stripped of my citizenship, put in a detention camp and deported. Not because I have broken any law but because I will refuse to let ICE terrorize our city, Mamdani wrote in his statement.\n\nMamdani also called Trumps praise of Adams unsurprising, adding: At the very moment when MAGA Republicans are attempting to destroy the social safety net, kick millions of New Yorkers off of healthcare and enrich their billionaire donors at the expense of working families, it is a scandal that Eric Adams echoes this Presidents division, distraction and hate. Voters will resoundingly reject it in November.\n\nWhile the billionaire owner of Tesla and SpaceX was once a key aide to Trump and a major donor to his presidential campaign last year, Trumps Big Beautiful Bill has created a public rift between Trump and Musk.\n\nMusk has repeatedly decried the bill online and has threatened to forma new political partyas a response to the bill passing.\n\nMusk stands to be affected by the finance bill that the Senate narrowly passed on Tuesday, as it ends tax credits worth up to $7,500 for purchases of electric vehicles (EVs) from September 30. This could significantly reduce consumer demand for EVs in the US.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on Monday, Trump wrote, Without subsidies, Elon would probably have to close up shop and head back home to South Africa. No more Rocket launches, Satellites, or Electric Car Production, and our Country would save a FORTUNE.\n\nPerhaps we should have DOGE take a good, hard, look at this? BIG MONEY TO BE SAVED!!! Trump added, in reference to theDepartment of Government Efficiency, an advisory body aimed at boosting government efficiency and upgrading information technology, that Musk formed and led at the start of Trumps second administration, before leaving on May 30.\n\nOn Tuesday, when reporters asked Trump if he was going to deport Musk, he said, Well have to take a look. We might have to put DOGE on Elon.\n\nUnder certain circumstances, US citizens by naturalisation can lose their status as citizens. This process is also called denaturalisation.\n\nThis can happen if naturalised citizens commit certain crimes, including terrorism, war crimes, human rights violations, sex crimes or naturalisation fraud, meaning they obtained their citizenship through fraud, misrepresentation or illegal procurement.\n\nOn June 11, the Justice Department issued a memo stating that it would prioritise denaturalisation by instituting civil proceedings for people if they either illegally procured naturalization or procured naturalization by concealment of a material fact or by willful misrepresentation.\n\nThe memo added: The Civil Division shall prioritize and maximally pursue denaturalization proceedings in all cases permitted by law and supported by the evidence.\n\nA naturalised citizen can also lose their citizenship if they commit an act of treason against the US, or run for public office or join the military of a foreign country.\n\nMost recently, the Justice Department announced on June 13 that UK citizen Elliott Duke, a convicted collector and distributor of child sexual abuse material, had been denaturalised. In a news release, the Justice Department said Duke enlisted in the US Army in 2012 and began receiving and sending child sex abuse material online while serving in Germany. Duke did not list this crime in his naturalisation application in 2013. He was convicted of receipt and possession of child pornography in 2014.\n\nIt is not likely, according to experts.\n\nDenaturalisation is limited to cases where the government can prove material fraud in their original applications, said Michael Kagan, professor of law at University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\n\nIt is rare and unlikely for either Musk or Mamdani. This appears to be irresponsible rhetoric designed to intimidate political opponents.\n\nThe US has revoked the citizenship of naturalised citizens on different occasions over the past few decades.\n\nCases of denaturalisation were more frequent during the first half of the 20th century while the two world wars and, later, the Cold War with the Soviet Union were ongoing. Between 1926 and the mid-1940s, hundreds of people were denaturalised every year, according to political scientist Patrick Weil, author of The Sovereign Citizen, published in 2017.\n\nThe US government frequently tried to denaturalise citizens during the two Red Scare periods of 1917 to 1920 and 1947 to 1957, when the fear of communism was particularly high in the US. During this time, it was also very hard to obtain US citizenship by naturalisation.\n\nPeople who were denaturalised at the time included communists and Nazi sympathisers. Two famous cases were:\n\nIn 1967, the trend for denaturalisation slowed down when the US Supreme Court ruled that a US citizen could not be involuntarily deprived of their citizenship unless they met the specific criteria of having obtained naturalisation by fraud or of having committed serious offences.\n\nThe ruling came at the end of a case involving Beys Afroyim, who was born in Poland and became a naturalised US citizen in 1926. The US government tried to revoke his citizenship because Afroyim had voted in an Israeli legislative election in 1951.\n\nIn ruling this, the Supreme Court repealed a US federal law which said that US citizens could lose their citizenship if they vote in a foreign election.\n\n",

Any attempt to impose partisan ideology on judges through training programmes conducted by the Herbert Chitepo School of Ideology would undermine the rule of law and erode public trust.\n\nI mean, not even Chitepo himself would abase himself to the point of receiving training from this school named after him. We stand in defence of judicial independence, honouring the legacy of those who fought for justice and fairness. In Chitepos name; lets collectively rage against this unnecessary attack on judicial independence, Mpofu said.\n\nThe Chitepo School of Ideology has stirred controversy in the country; last year, there was uproar over Local Government Minister Daniel Garwes invitation to all councillors, including those from the opposition, to attend the workshop in Harare.\n\n",

They told the court they were coerced into drug-fuelled freak offs  which were also referred to as hotel nights or wild king nights  with male escorts, and abused throughout their relationships.\n\nCombss defence team painted a very different picture in their attempts to show that all sexual acts, including freak offs, were consensual.\n\nThey conceded the music star could be violent, had a bad temper, and used drugs. He also had multiple relationships at the same time.

In Chivayos case, he has always been identified as President Emmerson Mnangagwas runner.\n\nChivayos close relations with Mnangagwa, whom he once claimed to have in his palm, have raised suspicions that he gets most of his money via the president.\n\nHis name has been dropped in scandals that involve Zimbabwes elections, procurement of health and other material, plus the sale of gold and other precious minerals across the region.\n\nWonzwa umwe achiti Sir Wicknell ndi Runner. Imikaa makamboona kupi zino rinotenga private jet. Zvishandwa izvii. Zvovengwa ne muroyi chete, said Chivayo.\n\n(You will hear someone say I am a runner. Where have you ever seen a cut that allows you to buy a private jet. This is pure work. Only witches can hate this).\n\nChivayo can be seen stroking a model of the jet, whose price can go as high as US$95 million if it is to be customised.\n\nSpeaking on the video he has shared, Chivayo said he will have WMC 777 printed on its wing and body.\n\nAs of 2024, the base price of the Gulfstream G700 is $79 million, up from the initial $75 million, reads a review of the jet on Simple Flying, a respected aviation publication.\n\nCustomisations can add $5-20 million to the base price, resulting in a final cost between $85-95 million.\n\n",

We request that bail hearing be heard on July 3 at 11.15 am.\n\nThis has been necessitated by the presentation of certain documents which contain the medical history for the accused, which we need to verify before we make our submissions on the application for bail. So we request for the matter to be rolled over to July 3 for bail inquiry, said prosecutor Takudzwa Jambawu.\n\nZabas lawyer, Chris Mhike, said, We are naturally disappointed that the accused must spend another night in custody at a time she is not feeling well.\n\nShe had been on bed rest at the time of her arrest on the orders of her medical doctor. A prison is not the best of places for people who are unwell but your worship you must place on record that the State has not dismissed our submissions on the state of health of the accused.\n\nWe so believe that the request by the State is in the best interests of the accused person.\n\nIt is our hope that such an allowance would enable the state to attend to all the necessary administrative processes.\n\nWe only seek the prosecutions assurance that there will be no further delay on tomorrows proceedings and that the accused will be allowed to receive medical attention while in detention, Mhike said.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nMillions of US dollars generated from billboard advertising and rentals of council-owned properties are reportedly being siphoned for personal use in Harare and Chinhoyi.\n\nThis was revealed by Public Accounts Parliamentary Portfolio Committee (PAC) chairperson, Charlton Hwende after visiting Makonde RDC in Lions Den on Tuesday.\n\nThe committee is visiting several other local municipalities across the country to discuss a report titled Value for Money for Local Authorities 2023: Management of Revenue Generating Properties by Local Authorities.\n\nThe report, tabled by the Auditor General, examines how local authorities manage revenue collection from properties under local authorities jurisdiction.\n\nSo far, we have visited Harare, yesterday (Monday) we were in Chinhoyi at the local authority.\n\nThere were several issues that were cited in the Value for Money Audit Report for the local authorities by the Auditor General, chief among them was the issue of the revenue leakages in council-rented properties.\n\nWith Chinhoyi, the situation is bad. They are unable to, or even unwilling to collect what is due to council. A number of people are occupying council-rented houses, they are not paying, Hwende said, adding that even though the rentals were as little as $20 for two-bedroom houses, but still, tenants were still not paying.\n\nHe said there was no willingness on the councils part to recover debt.\n\nWe then discovered that most of the council officials are involved in the issuing of leases, and we suspect that most of them are the ones who are actually holding many of the leases.\n\nOn the sample of houses that we visited in Chinhoyi, we went to about five rented commercial properties and discovered that the shops, the licence, the lease that is issued on a tenant, after the lease is issued, there are about five or six other people there that are renting the next one to the next one before you reach the original owner of the lease. And nothing is coming to the council coffers, added Hwende.\n\nOn the billboard issue from Harare to Chinhoyi, it was the same issue, according to the PAC chairperson who revealed that no rentals were being collected from advertisers.\n\nIn the report on billboards, some councils allegedly destroyed or tampered with technology systems to revert to manual work and loot, as a new system installed was no longer allowing them to loot funds.\n\nIt was reported that in one month, US$1 million was collected in one month from billboard rentals of a certain council as the system was still functional but after being vandalised by the council workers, the following month realised not even a dollar.\n\nEvidence also came out that the issue of collusion between councillors and advertising agencies needs to be further investigated.\n\nWe will be recommending the Auditor General to re-look into these issues. Then also, a lack of commercial enterprises that can augment the dwindling revenues from the local authorities.\n\nIts a major concern in Chinhoyi, theres nothing, no initiative, no plans. In Zvimba, the situation was a little bit different, Hwende highlighted.\n\n",
