            "content": "By Reuters\n\nA RAPIDLY growing wildfire raged across an upscale section of Los Angeles on Tuesday, destroying homes and creating traffic jams as 30,000 people evacuated beneath huge plumes of smoke that covered much of the metropolitan area.\n\nAt least 2,921 acres (1,182 hectares) of the Pacific Palisades area between the coastal settlements of Santa Monica and Malibu had burned, officials said, after they had already warned of extreme fire danger from powerful winds that arrived following extended dry weather.\n\nThe fire spread as officials warned the worst wind conditions were expected to come overnight, leading to concerns that more neighborhoods could be forced to flee.\n\nThe city of Santa Monica later ordered evacuations in the northern fringe of town.\n\nWitnesses reported a number homes on fire with flames nearly scorching their cars when people fled the hills of Topanga Canyon, as the fire spread from there down to the Pacific Ocean.\n\nWe feel very blessed at this point that theres no injuries that are reported, Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley told a press conference, adding that more than 25,000 people in 10,000 homes were threatened.\n\nFirefighters in aircraft scooped water from the sea to drop it on the nearby flames. Flames engulfed homes and bulldozers cleared abandoned vehicles from roads so emergency vehicles could pass, television images showed.\n\nAs the sun set over Los Angeles, towering orange flames illuminated the hills leading to Topanga Canyon.\n\nThe fire singed some trees on the grounds of the Getty Villa, a museum loaded with priceless works of art, but the collection remained safe largely because of preventive efforts to trim brush surrounding the buildings, the museum said.\n\nWith only one major road leading from the canyon to the coast, and only one coastal highway leading to safety, traffic crawled to a halt, leading people to flee on foot.\n\nCindy Festa, a Pacific Palisades resident, said that as she evacuated out of the canyon, fires were this close to the cars, demonstrating with her thumb and forefinger.\n\nPeople left their cars on Palisades Drive. Burning up the hillside. The palm trees  everything is going, Festa said from her car.\n\nBefore the fire started, the National Weather Service had issued its highest alert for extreme fire conditions for much of Los Angeles County from Tuesday through Thursday, predicting wind gusts of 50 to 80 mph (80 to 130 kph).\n\nWith low humidity and dry vegetation due to a lack of rain, the conditions were about as bad as it gets in terms of fire weather, the Los Angeles office of the National Weather Service said on X.\n\nGovernor Gavin Newsom, who declared a state of emergency, said the state positioned personnel, firetrucks and aircraft elsewhere in Southern California because of the fire danger to the wider region, he added.\n\nHopefully, were wrong, but were anticipating other fires happening concurrently, Newsom told the press conference.\n\nA second blaze dubbed the Eaton Fire later broke out some 30 miles (50 km) inland in the foothills above Pasadena, consuming 200 acres (80 hectares), Cal Fire said.\n\nThe powerful winds changed President Joe Bidens travel plans, grounding Air Force One in Los Angeles. He had planned to make a short flight inland to the Coachella Valley for a ceremony to create two new national monuments in California but the event was rescheduled for a later date at the White House.\n\nI have offered any federal assistance that is needed to help suppress the terrible Pacific Palisades fire, Biden said in statement. A federal grant had already been approved to help reimburse the state of California for its fire response, Biden said.\n\nPacific Palisades is home to several Hollywood stars. Actor James Woods said on X he was able to evacuate but added, I do not know at this moment if our home is still standing.\n\nActor Steve Guttenberg told KTLA television that friends of his were impeded from evacuating because others had abandoned their cars in the road.\n\nIts really important for everybody to band together and dont worry about your personal property. Just get out, Guttenberg said. Get your loved ones and get out.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nINFORMATION, Publicity and Broadcasting Services Minister, Jenfan Muswere has called for a complete overhaul of the State media inorder to improve its operations in the digital age.\n\nAddressing journalists at a Cabinet media engagement cafe this Monday at Munhumutapa offices, Muswere expressed concern over the continued decrease of copy circulation at government-controlled media institutions, reiterating the need to digitalise operations.\n\nHe said it was important to adapt to new ways of publishing and incorporate digital tools as a means to catch up with other media companies elsewhere.\n\nOn that note, Muswere highlighted that this year, his ministry will hold media training sessions in digital media incorporating AI and data analytics for media practitioners to be able to report effectively.\n\nAccording to Muswere, the number of printed copy has gone down by a huge margin compared to some years back owing to many reasons, amongst them the coming of new and digital media, respectively.\n\nThe ministers call comes at the backdrop of a number of challenges facing newsrooms, where most are at the brink of collapse due to economic hardships, hence the importance of navigating new ways of survival.\n\nWe have had quite a number of meetings with some of the executives and editors on how best we can deal with the challenges related to the low circulation per day in terms of the print media.\n\nWe are all aware that we used to print more than 200,000, and to less than 10,000 daily circulations, all print media houses combined on average, that we now need to implement digital transformation strategies.\n\nI can highlight that Zimpapers is undergoing the total transformation of the institution, focusing primarily on digital transformation, behavioural transformation of management, board, and staff, a cultural transformation, and at the same time ensuring that the institution is totally restructured to align with online media platform operations.\n\nDue to the new technology and new media, online platforms have been the favorite among Zimbabweans who now shun hard copies for online platforms.\n\nThe minister emphasised the importance of digital sovereignty to find best ways to work together with all media houses in order to ensure whatever diversity that is there, everyone should always defend Zimbabwe.\n\nThere are some of the programmes that we have put in place, starting with the ZimDigital project, which seeks to ensure that we achieve 100% media sovereignty in our country, and the ZimDigital project received funding in the last quarter of 2024, and we believe that we can catapult television coverage from 38% to 100% within a space of two years.\n\nWe can also accelerate digital transformation in terms of the ZimDigital for radio from 62% to 100% within the next two years. So, all modalities have been put in place with a steering committee that I chair to ensure that we can accelerate the ZimDigital project, said Muswere.\n\nHe expects the project will be completed within the first quarter of 2025.\n\nWe are pretty sure that before April, we will be in a position to invite the President to officially launch the ZimDigital project.\n\nThe same applies with the media and communication policy, which will now go through other government processes for refinement and approval. The same also applies with regards to the tax holidays that we have offered to the media fraternity in order to support the growth and robustness of the sector.\n\nHe said among other strategies, the ministry adopted the heritage-based broadcasting, because our language, culture, values as a people define.who we are, and we have 16 official languages, which also includes Kalanga, Chindawu, and many other local languages.\n\nSo, the primary focus is for us to be able to participate even on the digital highway, even on digital platforms, as you collect, as you gather news and content across the country, let us also support our languages as the modernisation of Montrose Studios is taking place, and this will become the center of heritage-based broadcasting.\n\nWe want broadcasters, media practitioners, to be able to contribute to the digital world in our own local languages, so that each and every Zimbabwean is not left behind. The ZBC restructuring is also taking place,\n\nMuswere said there are no enemies anymore and media houses should find each other and work towards putting Zimbabwe first regardless of differences.\n\nZimbabwe comes first, that it is the responsibility of each and every Zimbabwean, and for the media fraternity, let us always ensure that we protect, advance, and defend the interests and rights of Zimbabwe, that whatever differences.\n\nSaid the minister: I am also happy to indicate that the members of the Fourth Estate have responded appropriately in order to support nation building. We all know that genocide, wars, instabilities in other countries, its the social media, its members of the Fourth Estate.\n\nIm happy to announce that weve had a number of sessions together with the Zimbabwe Media Commission (ZMC), which commission, in terms of the ZMC Act amendments, we are strengthening the legislation in order to manage the conduct of journalism as a profession.\n\nWe need to protect members of the Fourth Estate, because what we want is diversity, what we want is pluralism, what we want is to ensure that with all those different views, we remain united to defend the media sovereignty of our country, Muswere said.\n\n",

Poverty, unemployment, and lack of access to education create conditions where individuals resort to illegal activities for survival.\n\nThe prevalence and types of crimes vary widely across African countries. It was also noted that crime is a universal issue, reflective of societal disparities and struggles, but its manifestations vary across regions.\n\nIn urban centres, particularly in informal settlements, these challenges are acute. Many African cities are grappling with rapid urbanisation, leaving governments struggling to provide adequate housing, sanitation, and security services. This neglect fosters environments where petty theft, burglary, and violent crime thrive, noted Numbero Crime Index.\n\nSouth Africa, the most dangerous country to be on the continent and fifth globally, faces pervasive violent crimes such as homicides, robberies, and assaults, exacerbated by unemployment and inadequate law enforcement. Despite efforts to curb crime, such as community policing initiatives and social programmes, many South Africans report feeling unsafe.\n\nNigeria ranked 11th globally with a crime index score of 66.6, confronts widespread security issues, including organised crime, armed robberies, and kidnappings.\n\nAngola follows closely, ranked 13th globally with a score of 66.3, where both violent and property crimes remain prevalent, particularly in urban areas.\n\nBelow are the top 10 African countries with the highest crime index at the start of 2025, according to Numbero Crime Index.\n\n1.

How do we start it? It starts with you and me.\n\nPlease stop buying land from land barons. That is the first call on regularisation.\n\nWe now have structures put in place to ensure that you can come to the Minister of Local Government, you can go to any local authority and be able to get information of the availability of a stand in the area of choice if they are there. So, stop buying land from criminals. Thats the first step of regularisation, Garwe said.\n\nFor already existing informal settlements such as Caledonia and Harare South, a budget is now in place to ensure that government engages developers to do servicing and put water, sewer and roads infrastructure.\n\nWe want residents to participate. How do they participate? If they are desirous of having a title deed, they pay for the land first.\n\nGarwe reiterated land belongs to the State and the public should be made aware that land barons were stealing government property and parceling it out to unsuspecting homeseekers.\n\n",

This will enable the city to supply water to high-lying areas such as Ridgemont, Northgate, Hertfordshire, Harben Park, and Athlone.\n\nThe city has budgeted for this project and is expected to commence work soon, he said.\n\nIn an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Chivoko confirmed that the water that is being supplied to its residents is treated using several chemicals and it is safe for human consumption.\n\nYes, our water is treated. We use standard water treatment chemicals, including chlorine and alum, to ensure the water is safe for consumption.\n\nOur treatment process involves coagulation, sedimentation, filtration, and disinfection. We treat the water from our dams regularly, following strict safety protocols, the mayor explained.\n\nWith a more reliable water supply, residents are now able to access clean water for drinking, cooking, and other domestic uses.\n\nThis has improved the overall health and well-being of the citys residents, particularly children and the elderly, who are most vulnerable to water-borne diseases.\n\n",

To plan using the local currency is to plan to fail.\n\nShelton Sibanda, chief investment officer at Imara Asset Management, which oversees $100 million, expects companies to reduce their ZiG holdings to protect themselves.\n\nThe velocity, that is speed of using ZiG will increase, he said in an interview by phone from the capital, Harare.\n\nNo one will want to keep any ZiG.\n\nPower shortages\n\nOther factors that are expected to impact companies profits this year include power shortages that last as long as 18-hours a day, and their fight with informal traders for US dollar revenues amid strict local-currency pricing controls imposed by authorities, Mugaga said.\n\nThe power issue will remain for the first half of the year as its linked closely to the hydropower situation in Kariba, said Mugaga.\n\nAn El Nio-induced drought has reduced water levels at the dam, one of the nations main power sources.\n\nBusinesses also dont expect the trading conditions to improve any time soon.\n\nThe operating environment is expected to remain bearish driven by exchange-rate and inflation dynamics, said Maxen Karombo, OK Zimbabwes CEO.\n\nThe ZiG traded little changed on Monday at 25.83 per dollar on the official market, according to data on the central banks website.\n\n",

People are warned to be careful as they cross streams and small rivers.\n\nPeople must be careful not to be under trees when it is raining. They must be careful not to walk barefooted when it is raining and must be indoors because it is coming with some harshness, Garwe said.\n\nThe Civil Protection Unit (CPU), Garwe said, is fully prepared for any eventualities caused by the rains.\n\nAreas that are likely to experience the thunderstorms are Harare, Bulawayo and Victoria Falls.\n\nWe are prepared for any mishap that might befall us and resources are available, Garwe said, adding the anticipated rains were not as strong as the rains expected from Cyclone Chido, which did not affect Zimbabwe last month.\n\nThe CPU was fully prepared for Cyclone Chido but, fortunately for Zimbabwe, Chido did not visit us.\n\n",

            "content": "Trading in the stock market can be difficult, especially given the variety of technical indicators accessible to traders. The Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI) is a lesser-known yet extremely powerful indicator.\n\nThestochastic momentum indexisa technical indicator that traders use to identify potential buy and sell signals in the market.Instead of reading the assets closing price as the standard stochastic indicator, the SMI calculates the closing price based on the high/low range average. Lets explore this article in detail.\n\nThe stochastic oscillator is calculated by comparing an assets closing price to its price range over a specified period. The price range represents the difference between the highest and lowest prices at the same time.\n\nThe stochastic oscillator generates the %K and %D lines. The %K line displays the current closing price as a percentage of the price range for a given time period, usually 14 days. The %D line is a moving average of the %K line, typically calculated as a 3-day simple moving average.\n\nThese oscillators are also known as oversold and overbought indicators.\n\nYoull need to pay attention on two lines %D and %K that are here:\n\n%K is commonly set to 5 and indicates the main changes of price (slow line).\n\n%D is the quick line, a simple moving average of the %K, which is set to 3.\n\nThese two lines fluctuate between the values of +100 and -100. The 0 line represents the midpoint of our observation periods high/low range.\n\nAn additional level, +/- 40, is where traders identify a market as overbought or oversold.\n\n+40 is viewed as overbought\n\n-40 is viewed as oversold\n\nYoull see overline that is green and overload line will be red. When the current closing price plot is more than the average of the high/low, positive youll see return on the SMI.\n\nIf the current closing plot is less than the average of the high and low, youll get a negative return plot.\n\nWhen you use SMI, youll use three maintradingstrategies:\n\nThere are various methodical steps include in calculating stochastic momentum index. Here are the following steps below:\n\nFor calculating the median price, this is the average of the highest high and the lowest low over a given period.\n\nMedian Price = (Highest High + Lowest Low) / 2\n\nIts the methodical step of calculating the distance from median price.\n\nDistance = Closing Price  Median Price\n\nTo smooth the data and eliminate noise, use a Simple Moving Average (SMA) on the distance.\n\nSmoothed Distance = SMA (Distance, period)\n\nHigh  Low Range = Highest High  Lowest Low\n\nSmoothed Range = SMA (High  Low Range, period)\n\nSMI = 100  Smoothed Range / Smoothed Distance\n\nSMI (final) = SMA (SMI, signal period)\n\nIn this way, traders can identify the potential of trading signals.\n\nThe Stochastic Momentum Index (SMI) is a useful indicator. It provides the detailed information aboutmarket momentum. It also allows traders to better understand price movements and potential turning moments. The SMI enhances the standard stochastic oscillator by giving a more refined and sensitive measure of market momentum.\n\n",
