Chiwengas ambition and growing power in the party had also forced talks of a term extension to 2030 to be shelved.\n\nAsked whether a coup was possible, Mawarire said that although he could not say it with authority, anything was possible.\n\nThere is a possibility of escalating political turmoil, of further collapse of the economy and once it collapses and there is discohesion in the ruling party, anything is possible, said Mawarire.\n\nDespite the recent silence, NewZimbabwe.com is reliably informed that provinces are being whipped into supporting Mnangagwas illegal term extension and in the process shut out Chiwenga.\n\nAdded Mawarire: What I am really sure about is that President Emmerson Mnangagwa is pushing for an unconstitutional third term and that is the source of all of the upheaval and the confusion in the cockpit.\n\nI do not think the conflict is between Mnangagwa and Chiwenga alone. The conflict is between Mnangagwa and the general polity which does not believe in the mutilation of our constitution.\n\nSection 95 of the Zimbabwean constitution sets a two-term limit on the presidency.\n\nMnangagwa is in his second five-year term, having finished off about seven months of late President Robert Mugabes term after deposing him in a coup in November 2017.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nThe government, through the Mutapa Investment Fund (MIF), has injected US$5.3 million to revive Dorowa Mine in a move aimed at boosting local fertiliser production, reducing reliance on imports, and protecting farmers from costly and potentially harmful chemicals.\n\nAn additional US$11 million is expected to be released to ensure the mine reaches full capacity by March 2026, with a target annual output of 150,000 tonnes of phosphate concentrate.\n\nThis was revealed by Tatenda Chimusoro, Head of Investments for Agriculture and Industrials at the Mutapa Investment Fund, during a Tuesday tour of fertiliser companies by the Parliamentary Portfolio Committee on Industry and Commerce.\n\nMIF is working to revive struggling state-owned entities through loans designed to generate profits and strengthen value chains. The Dorowa intervention will allow the mine to reach its full potential, producing enough phosphates to support local fertiliser blending and meet farmers needs, said Chimusoro.\n\nSilinos Mapfumo, a ZimPhos board member, told the committee that the company adds value to phosphates mined from Dorowa by converting them into NPK basal fertilisers applied during planting. This ensures high-quality fertiliser is made available to farmers across the country, he said.\n\nCommittee chairperson Clemence Chiduwa said the visit was crucial to understanding the domestic fertiliser value chain. It is important to see how local production can meet farmers needs while creating jobs and reducing dependence on imports, he noted.\n\nMapfumo added that the fertiliser industry is a top priority under the National Development Strategy 1 (NDS1). The objective is to increase domestic production and value addition while cutting back on imports. Government already holds a major stake in the industry through MIF, with ownership managed by the Industrial Development Corporation of Zimbabwe (IDCZ), he said.\n\nCurrently, Zimbabwe imports a significant share of its fertiliser, often at higher costs and with risks of harmful contaminants such as cadmium and lead. The revival of Dorowa Mine is expected to lower prices for farmers, create jobs, and strengthen the agricultural sector.\n\nThe Mutapa Investment Funds intervention is timely, Chimusoro emphasised. With the mine fully operational by March, we can secure a sustainable supply of fertilisers, protect farmers, and reduce dependence on imported products.\n\nDorowa Mine, a subsidiary of the Chemplex Group of Companies, had temporarily halted production to allow for major plant upgrades.\n\n",

            "content": "By Farai Mutsaka, UNICEF\n\nMUTOKO, Zimbabwe  Its a Friday, and classes end at midday. But unlike before, Miriam Kaseke, a teacher at Domborinenhiwi Primary School, is in no rush to find transport home. Instead, she looks forward to hosting family members for the weekend at the school, nestled deep in the rural eastern fringe of Mashonaland East province.\n\nThey are comfortable coming here these days. It feels like home, she said, as she made her way to a new grey house on the school grounds, built with support from the Schools Improvement Grant (SIG), Complementary Funding for teacher accommodation.\n\nThis warmth and comfort sharply contrast with Kasekes arrival at the school in 2019. Back then, the single, dilapidated four-roomed teachers house was already overcrowded, leaving her with no option but to occupy the pantry.\n\nA space originally meant as an indoor toilet was already taken. That tiny pantry became my kitchen, my bedroom, and my living room all in one, she recalled. I couldnt even turn around properly when sleeping. If I tried to roll over, my head would end up in a dish of water and my feet on the plates, she added, painfully remembering how desperate she felt during her first days.\n\nThere was no privacy, and inviting my spouse to visit was out of the question. I wondered to myself, Of all my college classmates, am I the cursed one? she said.\n\nThe houses doors didnt lock properly, and the windows barely stayed in their frames. Reptiles would freely slip through its leaky roof. She laughs nervously as she recalls one teacher fleeing his room in terror after a snake slithered under his blankets.\n\nIt was impossible to get a restful nights sleep. I constantly struggled just to feel safe. I wanted to go home, but being on a year-long probation, I couldnt transfer immediately, she said.\n\nThe poor conditions extended beyond the accommodation to the teaching environment itself.\n\nIt was a disaster, from the teachers lodging to the classrooms. I felt drained every morning walking into school, knowing I would return that evening to a place I was forced to call home, Kaseke said.\n\nOne classroom block was a mud structure, another had lost its roof to the wind, offering little protection for teachers and pupils alike. Without windows or doors, livestock roamed freely inside, destroying books and learning materials. Teachers had to deal with composite classes, turning both learning and teaching into a nightmare.\n\nTeachers would frequently be absent or rarely stay long, forcing the school to rely on untrained community volunteers, mostly recent school leavers, said Melody Mupfudze, the acting school head.\n\nThis challenge reflects a wider regional problem. According to a 2020 UNICEF study titled Time to Teach: Teacher Attendance and Time on Task in Eastern and Southern Africa, teacher absenteeismranging from 15 to 45 per cent in the regionis a major contributor to a learning crisis. In low- and middle-income rural schools, over half of the children finish primary school unable to read or understand simple texts. The report highlights that poor working conditions often drive teacher absence, while stronger parental and community engagement improves attendance and classroom presence.\n\nAt Domborinenhiwi Primary School, the SIG intervention is beginning to address this issue.\n\nWe are working to grow our teaching staff. In 2019, we had seven teachers; now only four remain, although we are getting another one this coming term. We will still need four more. But I am confident the current teachers will stay because the situation on classrooms and teachers accommodation has significantly improved in recent years, said Mupfudze, who recalled marking books while sitting on a water bucket when she first arrived in 2012.\n\nShe praised the SIG Complementary Funding for transforming the schools fortunes. The school has roofed and floored its run-down classroom block, purchased desks, and, with continuing support, constructed a brand-new block specifically for infant pupils.\n\nThat new block is the most beautiful of all. We did everything from foundation to roofing with SIG funds; we had enough resources, said Mupfudze, pointing proudly to a bright yellow classroom building.\n\nUNICEFZimbabwe/2025/Farai Mutsaka.Improved housing and classroom blocks are inspiring teachers at Domborinenhiwi Primary School.\n\nInspired by the ongoing changes, Kaseke opted to stay and become a key part of the schools development effort.\n\nI thought to myself, I can be part of this big picture. I need to get involved. Since then, I have been part of the team working to make this a school other communities will look to for inspiration, she said.\n\nThe experience has also enriched Kaseke with practical knowledge about school building and management. A newcomer in 2019, she quickly became deeply involved in the schools transformation under the SIG intervention, becoming familiar with the whole school approach promoted by the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education and UNICEF.\n\nThis approach centres on making communities active partners in school development to foster learning environments that are child-friendly, widely supported, and sustainable.\n\nThe SIG funds gave us a huge boost, but we couldnt have succeeded without community help. We engaged parents, political leaders, and traditional authorities; everyone became part of the team, Kaseke reflected.\n\nThe whole school approach emphasises that successful school transformation requires a participatory, shared ownership model. It involves parents, caregivers, traditional and political leaders, religious influencers, and even the children themselves as key stakeholders in development.\n\nOn a recent day, several men used wheelbarrows and shovels to transport sand, which is essential for construction work.\n\nLets make sure everyone is here, we cant afford to start the rainy season with this block unfinished, said School Development Committee chairperson Knowledge Meki to volunteers gathered to contribute unpaid labour.\n\nWe have completed the other blocks and teachers accommodation, but we still have one block left to finish, he added.\n\nUNICEFZimbabwe/2025/Farai MutsakaA community effort, combined with UNICEF-supported funding, breathes new life into struggling schools in Zimbabwe.\n\nLocal councillor Christopher Machipisa was among those lending a hand. He understands the critical role education plays in an area where artisanal gold mining lures childrenboth boys and girlsinto hazardous mining activities for quick cash.\n\nThe problems at school reflect what happens at home. Children come to school but find no teachers. At home, they see young boys flaunting money from gold mining over education. The girls often marry the miners. But these are short-term gains; the real long-term achievements come from good education, said Machipisa. Thats the challenge we want to overcome, and why creating good conditions for teachers to stay is so important.\n\nKaseke, standing alongside other teachers, smiled as she looked on.\n\nWere not going anywhere as long as you keep this dedication, she said with a laugh.\n\n",

It triggered a series of events that have laid bare the intensifying factionalism within the ruling party.\n\nMnangagwas loyalists are mobilising party structures to pass a resolution at the October 13-18 conference to extend the 83-year-old leaders term.\n\nThe proposed extension, which would require a constitutional amendment to remove the two-term limit for presidents, has deeply divided Zanu PF.\n\nRetired General Chiwenga opposes the extension, which would derail his own presidential ambitions. He is reportedly backed by the countrys security establishment.\n\nHis confrontation with the president came a day after Tagwireidonated 300 luxury vehicles to Zanu PF, amid allegations that he was attempting to influence the term extension agenda\n\nJust days earlier, another controversial businessman, Wicknell Chivayo-closely linked to the president, donated cash, vehicles, and ambulances worth over $4 million to Zanu PF regional chairpersons. He said the donation was in celebration of Mnangagwas 83rd birthday.\n\nIn the dossier, Chiwenga alleged that Tagwireihad siphoned $3.2 billion from Zanu PF through opaque investments now being used to buy support for a third term. He called for the immediate arrest of Tagwirei and Chivayo, as well as the recovery of the looted funds.\n\nZanu PF spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa dismissed the dossier, describing it as part of a destabilisation campaign driven by power-hungry individuals.\n\nMutsvangwa said the former army commander must wait for the partys elective congress in 2027 if he wishes to succeed Mnangagwa.\n\nThere are persistent efforts from detractors who are throwing cobwebs to make us witch-hunt ourselves, he told journalists in Harare on Monday.\n\nThe politburo is not unduly moved by these things. This debate should not define Zanu PF.\n\nThere are people who wish to see the president removed so they can take over.\n\nWait for your time, it will come at the congress through a democratic process.\n\nA day after Mutsvangwas remarks, President Mnangagwa announced a surprise reshuffle of his top politburo lieutenants, removing a key ally of the VP from the influential Secretary-General post.\n\nEldred Masunurgure, a Harare-based academic, said the escalation of Zanu PFs internal power struggles had reached dangerous levels.\n\nMasunungure drew parallels with past leadership battles in the party, dating back to the pre-independence era when Zanu PF, led by Mugabe, was one of two major liberation movements alongside ZAPU, led by the late Vice President Joshua Nkoma\n\nThose phases had bloody endings-hopefully that wont be repeated this time, he said.\n\nThe long and short of it is that the events in the party are not a mere distraction. These dynamics must not be misread by the public especially the opposition, such as it remains as signalling the demise of the party or its regime.\n\nIn 2017, the army-led by retired Gen Chiwenga, then commander-intervened, claiming that Zanu PF infighting over Mugabes succession threatened the partys survival.\n\nAt the time, Mnangagwa, Mugabes long-time deputy, was in exile in South Africa, having been dismissed over alleged presidential ambitions. The military accused Mugabe of purging war veterans to clear the path for then First Lady Grace Mugabe to succeed him.\n\nMasunungure said Zanu PFs infighting is likely to intensify after the October conference, which will not feature leadership contests, although the push to extend the presidents term is expected to dominate proceedings.\n\nIf anything, the gladiation will likely be either more vicious, hopefully bloodless, or more subtle in a Machiavellian sense, he predicted.\n\nThere will clearly be winners and losers at the conference, but its hard to imagine the losers turning the other cheek.\n\nReuben Mbofana, a Harare-based political commentator, said the reshuffle of the partys top brass was designed to ensure Mnangagwas term extension agenda remains on track.\n\nTo me, this is nothing short of Mnangagwa safeguarding his 2030 agenda just ahead of the party conference, using those reassignments, Mbofana said.\n\nPolitical analysts say the military is likely to play a central role in Zanu PFs succession battles, as it did during Mugabes final days.\n\nPresident Mnangagwa has repeatedly insisted he does not wish to remain in office beyond his two terms, yet he has taken no steps to halt his supporters campaign for a two-year extension.\n\n",

The results announced on September 22 are from the first two completed diamond drill holes.\n\nOne of the holes, drilled to 250 metres, returned notable assays including 5.10g/t over 2.18m from 28.00m depth, 13.66g/t over 2.75m from 134.00m, and 7.87g/t over 2.60m from 209.80m.\n\nThe second hole, also drilled to 250 metres, intersected 3.49g/t over 5.69m from 28.90m, 9.31g/t over 1.00m from 85.55m, and the headline 8.09g/t over 8.05m from 158.62m.\n\nSurface diamond drilling at Bills Luck continues to exceed our expectations. Weve now confirmed that the main Bills Luck ore body extends to at least 160m vertical depth, with multiple high-grade intersections throughout the latest exploration holes. We are particularly encouraged by the 8.05m intersection at 158.62m carrying 8.09g/t gold, said Kavango CEO Ben Turney.\n\nHe added that the company is preparing to advance mining operations by extending shaft sinking from the current three-level to a four-level operation.\n\n",
