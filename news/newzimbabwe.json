Tagarira, Tawanda Mutangambiri, Bethel Princess Chiyangwa (USA), Donald Mdlongwa, Nonthantha Mangonya, members of the Progressive Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (PTUZ) who have since relocated to the UK.Also included on the list is a former school headmaster Denver Mauwa. Others are Dadirai Mukwedeya, Shamiso Moyo, Ettar Patience Mhlanga and Bonisile Nyoni who are based in IrelandSecurity officials reportedly also expressed particular interest in Shepherd Yuda, a former whistleblower who now broadcasts critical content via live streaming platforms.
