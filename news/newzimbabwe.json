            "content": "BBC\n\nElon Musk has hit out at President Donald Trumps signature tax and spending bill, describing it as a disgusting abomination, in a widening rift between the two.\n\nThe tech billionaire posted on X that the bill would add to the US budget deficit and saddle Americans with crushing debt.\n\nThe budget, which includes huge tax breaks and more defence spending, was passed by the House of Representatives last month and is now being considered by senators.\n\nShame on those who voted for it, said Musk, hinting that he may try to unseat the politicians responsible at next years midterm elections.\n\nThe bill has the backing of President Donald Trump and would be the legislative linchpin of his second-term agenda if it passes Congress.\n\nMusk left the administration abruptly last week after 129 days working to cut costs with his team, known as Doge.\n\nThe comments mark his first public disagreement with Trump since leaving government, after having previously called the plan disappointing.\n\nThe South African-born tech billionaires time in the Trump administration came to an end on 31 May, although Trump said that he will, always, be with us, helping all the way.\n\nIn its current form, the bill  which Trump refers to as the big beautiful bill  has been estimated to increase the budget deficit  the difference between what the government spends and the revenue it receives  by about $600bn (444bn) in the next fiscal year.\n\nIn a series of posts on X on Tuesday, Musk said that the outrageous, pork-filled spending bill will massively increase the already gigantic budget deficit to $2.5 trillion (!!!) and burden America [sic] citizens with crushingly unsustainable debt.\n\nIn American politics pork refers to spending on projects in lawmakers constituencies.\n\nMusk has previously vowed to fund campaign challenges against any Republican that votes against Trumps agenda. But on Tuesday he fired a warning to those who backed the bill.\n\nIn November next year, we fire all politicians who betrayed the American people, he wrote.\n\nAsked about Musks comments soon after the first post, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said the President already knows where Elon Musk stood on this bill.\n\nThis is one, big, beautiful bill, she added. And hes sticking to it.\n\nThe legislation also pledges to extend soon-to-expire tax cuts passed during the first Trump administration in 2017, as well as an influx of funds for defence spending and to fund the administrations mass deportations of undocumented immigrants.\n\nTo the dismay of fiscal conservatives, it would lift the limit on the amount of money the government can borrow, known as the debt ceiling, to $4tn.\n\nThe comments from Musk reflect wider tensions among Republicans over the plan, which faced stiff opposition from different wings of the party as it worked its way through the House.\n\nThe Senate has now taken it up, and divisions are already emerging in that chamber, which is also narrowly controlled by Republicans.\n\nKentucky Senator Rand Paul has said over the last few days he will not support the bill if it raises the debt ceiling.\n\nThe GOP [the Republican Party] will own the debt once they vote for this, he told CBS News, the BBCs US partner, over the weekend.\n\nTrump responded to Paul with a series of social media posts, accusing him of having very little understanding of the bill and saying that the people of Kentucky cant stand him.\n\nHis ideas are actually crazy, Trump wrote.\n\nRepublican lawmakers pushed back on Musks comments, with Senate majority leader John Thune telling reporters the party plans to proceed full speed ahead despite a difference of opinion.\n\nWe have an agenda that everybody campaigned on, most notably the president, he said.\n\nMike Johnson  the Republican Speaker who has ushered the legislation through the House  told reporters on Capitol Hill that my friend Elon is terribly wrong.\n\nIts a very important first start. Elon is missing it, Johnson said.\n\nJohnson said he had a 20-minute phone call with the tycoon about the bill on Monday, adding that its phasing out of electric vehicle tax credits could have an effect on Tesla, Musks firm.\n\nI lament that, Johnson said, expressing surprise that Musk criticised the bill despite their call. I just deeply regret hes made this mistake.\n\nAmong the issues that upset Musk involved air traffic control at the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), according toAxios.\n\nMusk was hoping it would be run on his Starlink satellite system, but he was denied because of issues relating to the technology and the appearance of a conflict of interest, the political outlet reported.\n\nSome Democrats welcomed Musks comments despite their previous criticism of him and the work of Doge.\n\nEven Elon Musk, whos been part of the whole process, and is one of Trumps buddies, said the bill is bad, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said. We can imagine how bad this bill is.\n\nTrump and Republicans in Congress have set a deadline of 4 July to get the measure passed and signed into law.\n\nMusk supported Trump in last years November election with donations of more than $250m.\n\nTo make peace with spending hawks, Trump is also asking Congress to pass a plan that would reduce current spending by $9.4bn, a figure derived from Doges work.\n\nIt would mainly slash funding for foreign aid, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and for broadcasters NPR and PBS.\n\n",

We filed a lot of complaints regarding the problems and risks posed by his dogs. Unfortunately, the more you reprimanded him, the more he would show his arrogant side, said one neighbour.\n\nWhen NewZimbabwe.com visited Bluffhill, a ramshackle kennel in which Mupinga kept his four dogs, the perimeter wall too short to secure the dangerous animals.\n\nEfforts to lobby authorities over the viciousness of the pitbulls fell on deaf ears, with officials turning a blind eye to Mupinga.\n\nElijah Machara, who was the first to find his uncles body, said the death had shaken the family.\n\nI was told by a neighbour to come and check on an unconscious body. When I got closer, I found Uncle Samuel dead. He had a deep cut on his neck, and my worst fear became reality  he was dead, said Machara.\n\nMachara is the latest victim in a rising number of fatal pitbull attacks, raising concerns about the safety and coexistence of pitbulls and people.\n\nAn estimated 12 countries worldwide have banned pitbull ownership, and there are growing calls for Zimbabwe to impose similar restrictions.\n\nHarare Mayor Jacob Mafume, in a social media post, said the City Council is working on regulating pitbulls.\n\nWe have raised concerns. We will explore whether, as council, we can stretch our mandate. Our position is that such dogs are dangerous and must be banned or strictly regulated  like how one would regulate a firearm, said Mafume.\n\n",

Sammons says the two teams will go into that match on an equal footing.\n\nI think South Africa have a great chance of taking that World Test Championship final. Two evenly matched teams. Its going to be a really good game and ultimately it will be decided by the batting unit that can fare best against two quality bowling attacks, he predicted.\n\nThe former Proteas batting consultant is also quite excited to be facing his native nation over the next few days.\n\nThis will also serve as good preparation for the official test series that the neighbours will play at the end of this month in Bulawayo.\n\nThe next four days against South Africa offer our team an amazing opportunity to prepare for what promises to be an exciting and challenging winter, with two tests against the same team and another two against New Zealand.\n\nSo the guys are really looking forward to the challenge and obviously the learnings that will come from it.\n\nIt is good for this group and for Zimbabwean cricket in general that theres so much test cricket available for them this year and obviously towards the end of last year. Its where your fundamentals are tested, and as a young group of players, its where youre going to take the greatest amount of learnings, concluded Sammons.\n\nZimbabwe played a one-off test match against England almost two weeks ago, and were ruthlessly beaten by an innings and 45 runs.\n\nThe coach admitted that the occasion got the better of his team, and says that there was a lot of anxiety among the players.\n\n",

            "content": "IOL\n\nThe Umkhonto Wesizwe (MK) partys announcement on Tuesday thatFloyd Shivambu had been removed from his position as Secretary-Generalduring a press briefing has ignited debate about the stability and governance of the MK party, which has long been perceived as a volatile and informal organisation.\n\nDuring a tense press briefing in Durban, the party said the decision follows an internal investigation into Shivambus recent trip to Malawi, which officials say contravened the partys constitution and raised questions about leadership discipline within the organisation.\n\nAccording to MK party officials, Shivambus visit to Malawi to meet withfugitive pastor Shepherd BushirisEnlightened Church was the catalyst for his dismissal.\n\nThe partys statement confirmed that the trip was unauthorised and inconsistent with its constitutional guidelines, which explicitly prohibit members from engaging in activities that could undermine the partys integrity or expose it to external scrutiny.\n\nThe partys leadership cited the trip as emblematic of deeper systemic issues, namely, a leadership style characterised by unpredictability, casual decision-making, and a lack of institutional discipline.\n\nIndependent political analyst Sandile Swana weighed in on the implications of Shivambus removal, drawing parallels to the leadership patterns associated with former President Jacob Zuma.\n\nI have observed that part of the HR strategies of Jacob Zumawhere even when he was the President of the State, ministers and top officials were often removed abruptlymirror what we are seeing in the MK party, Swana said.\n\nIts a pattern of instability and informal governance. Leadership positions are often shifted overnight, with little transparency or consistency.\n\nSwana further argued that this informal style fosters an environment where leadership is unpredictable.\n\nThe character of the MK partys leadership resembles Zumas era  characterised by casualness and personal loyalty rather than institutional stability.\n\nThis creates a fragile political landscape where alliances are fleeting, and leadership is often driven by personal whims rather than strategic planning, he added.\n\nSanet Solomon, a political analyst from the University of the Free States Department of Political Studies and Governance, expressed concern about Shivambus removals broader implications.\n\nThe decision to recall Shivambu was not entirely unexpected, especially given the controversy surrounding his Malawi trip, she said.\n\nSuch actions risk alienating voters and could negatively impact the partys prospects in upcoming elections.\n\nSolomon criticised MKs apparent lack of precise succession planning, noting that the partys leadership operates casually and informally.\n\nThis pattern of instability suggests a leadership style that is personal rather than institutional, which can be detrimental to the partys credibility and long-term viability, she warned.\n\nThe ousting of Shivambu has raised questions about the future direction of the MK party. Analysts speculate the party may be heading into profound introspection or further instability.\n\nSome political commentators suggest that the leaderships decision to remove Shivambu rather than confront him publicly reflects a strategic attempt to avoid further internal dissent.\n\nHowever, critics argue that such moves only deepen the perception of disorder within the MK party, especially given the partys history of leadership upheaval and infighting.\n\nSwana pointed out the parallels between MKs leadership chaos and Zumas style of governance, adding another layer of complexity.\n\nThe informal and personal nature of MKs leadership echoes Zumas approach  where loyalty and personal connections often trump institutional norms, Swana said.\n\nThis could indicate that the party is becoming a mirror of Zumas political style, which may have long-term consequences for its stability.\n\n",
