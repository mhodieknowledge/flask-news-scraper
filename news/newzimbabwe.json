            "content": "By Sports Reporter\n\nTHE last time Saul Chaminuka visited Nyamhunga Stadium in Kariba was on the 12th of April this year leading his former club Kwekwe United.\n\nFor obvious reasons, it is a match that he would want to forget because he lost 0-5, probably the heaviest defeat in his lengthy career as a coach in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League (PSL).This Saturday, the soft spoken gaffer returns to Nyamhunga Stadium in the resort town, leading Dynamos who are set for a date against Kauya Katuruturu as ZPC Kariba are affectionately known.Without any doubt, this will give him a reminiscence of his previous nightmarish visit with Kwekwe United.All eyes will be on Chaminuka to see if he can do the revenge, something he is quite confident about.I played Kariba this season with Kwekwe and they gave us a thrashing, but I think I also learned a lot of things in that game.I have confidence that we will be able to go around if we can not go over what would be obstacles in that game.One thing l know is we are going to score in that game and again l think our biggest undoing is after scoring we are planning to maintain the lead, said Chaminuka.Dembare walks into the match at the back of an abandoned match against FC Platinum at Mandava Stadium this past Sunday.The abandonment of the match was forced by Dynamos, who walked off the pitch in protest over the the penalty, which the referee awarded FC Platinum.The former Black Rhinos gaffer believes he has to work on the mentality of his boys so that they shift from the Mandava incident to Saturdays clash.Its something that we should be able to be going over now. Its not a question of fitness, but I think the mental aspect.Since we started training , we have been trying to address that, added Chaminuka.Dynamos is currently swimming in the relegation zone, occupying position 16 on the log with 14 points, six places from bottom-placed Kwekwe United with eight points.\n\nFor obvious reasons, it is a match that he would want to forget because he lost 0-5, probably the heaviest defeat in his lengthy career as a coach in the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League (PSL).\n\nThis Saturday, the soft spoken gaffer returns to Nyamhunga Stadium in the resort town, leading Dynamos who are set for a date against Kauya Katuruturu as ZPC Kariba are affectionately known.Without any doubt, this will give him a reminiscence of his previous nightmarish visit with Kwekwe United.All eyes will be on Chaminuka to see if he can do the revenge, something he is quite confident about.I played Kariba this season with Kwekwe and they gave us a thrashing, but I think I also learned a lot of things in that game.I have confidence that we will be able to go around if we can not go over what would be obstacles in that game.One thing l know is we are going to score in that game and again l think our biggest undoing is after scoring we are planning to maintain the lead, said Chaminuka.Dembare walks into the match at the back of an abandoned match against FC Platinum at Mandava Stadium this past Sunday.The abandonment of the match was forced by Dynamos, who walked off the pitch in protest over the the penalty, which the referee awarded FC Platinum.The former Black Rhinos gaffer believes he has to work on the mentality of his boys so that they shift from the Mandava incident to Saturdays clash.Its something that we should be able to be going over now.
