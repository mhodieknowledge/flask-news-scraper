            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nLISTED Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), TIGERE, has commended the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) for implementing inflation-easing policies to enable value preservation in the property sector.\n\nThe countrys first listed REIT portfolio comprises retail properties in strategic locations with a diversified tenant mix. The initial portfolio includes two properties, namely Highland Park (Harare), Pick n Pay & Chinamano Corner (Harare), anchored by Puma Energy and Simbisa Brands, which has a total gross lettable area (GLA) of 8,435 m2 (meters squared).\n\nPresenting a trading update for the quarter ended March 31 2025, TIGERE hailed the unwavering support extended by the central bank.\n\nThe first quarter of 2025 was characterised by notable currency stability, and this was anchored by an unwavering commitment by the Reserve Bank Governor to keep inflation in check. This stability was exemplified by a paltry 3.6% depreciation in the local currency unit, Zimbabwe Gold (ZWG), during the period under review (vs 256% in Q1 of 2024).\n\nWe conjecture that the recent policy pronouncements in SI 34 of 2025 will cushion formal retailers during the remainder of the year, attributable to improved price competitiveness and a gradual liberalisation of the exchange rate, the company said.\n\nThe company said the property market remains the favoured option for investors looking to shield their investments from currency shocks, and foresees a continued bias towards this asset class by individuals, corporates, and pension funds, who are keen on providing a tangible exit option for their members.\n\nWe opine that concerns of widespread price overheating within the sector are overstated, with pervasive supply-side gaps noted in key sub-segments such as warehousing, affordable housing, quality retail infrastructure and office space, said Tigere.\n\nDuring the period, the company maintained a 100% occupancy across its existing portfolio, which includes Highland Park Phase 1, Chinamano Corner, and the recently added Highland Park Phase 2 asset.\n\nThe REIT aims to add two new assets in Q3 of this financial year, as part of its pre-emptive right to acquire completed assets developed by the REIT Sponsor. Details of the Proposed Transaction will be made available in due course.\n\nThe Net Asset value of US$34,2 million was maintained during the period with a Net Property Income of US$535 632 up from US$ 376,404. Total comprehensive income of US$451,249 up from US$257,670.\n\nIn line with our ongoing commitment to pay quarterly distributions, the REIT is proud to declare its 10 consecutive dividend. The declared value for dividend 10 being USD 507,250 (USD 0,0474 cents per unit) in respect of the quarter ended 31 March 2025, added Tigere.\n\n",

The plaintiff has no case. This suit is manifestly opportunistic. The defendants are entitled to judgment, he said before throwing out the claim.\n\nHMMAS had sued Kereke and Briward Trading (PVT) seeking a refund in the sum of US$138,000 plus interest.\n\nThe plaintiff also sought anorder confirming the cancellation of anagreement of sale between itself andKereke.\n\nIt also wanted the court to declare that itpaid the full purchase price forthemedical institution,Fortress Hospital.\n\nHMMAS had claimed that in November 2014, it purchased Fortress Hospital from the defendants via two agreements.\n\nIt said one was for the immovable property, Stand 9653 Ruwa Township, upon which the hospital is built.\n\nThe other, on the same day, granted the plaintiff the right of first refusal for the movables and other assets associated with the hospital.\n\nThe defendants (Kereke and Briward Trading) were represented by their agent, Newton Madzika\n\nThe plaintiff was represented by its former Chief Executive Officer, Evaristo Rukasha.\n\nThe purchase price for the immovable property was US$800,000. The purchase price for the equipment and fittings was US$650,000.\n\nHMMAS said itduly paid the purchase prices.\n\nThe US$800,000 was paid in two tranches, US$700,000 through a bank then known as Kingdom/Afrasia, now defunct, and the balance through a firm of legal practitioners, Muza & Nyapadi, the conveyancers appointed to transfer title in the immovable property, reads court papers.\n\nThe US$650,000 for the assets was subsequently paid through Madzika.\n\nIt was alleged that on 21 March 2022, Kereke connived with Rukasha, who, in an act of abuse of office, signed an acknowledgement of debt on behalf of the plaintiff for US$400,000 in favour of the defendants, allegedly as outstanding amounts for Fortress Hospital.\n\nRukasha, it was alleged, caused some payments to be made in terms of the acknowledgement of debt.\n\nThe payments were irregular because the plaintiff had fully paid for the hospital.\n\nFollowing disciplinary proceedings, Rukasha was dismissed from employment.\n\nRelying on the acknowledgement of debt aforesaid, the first defendant, through threats, fraudulent misrepresentations and intimidation, coerced or manipulated the plaintiff into signing an agreement on 31 August 2023.\n\nAccording to the 31 August 2023 agreement, the purchase price was US$1,138,900, of which US$866,900 was acknowledged to have been paid, leaving a balance of US$272,000 outstanding.\n\nHMMAS said it had since paid US$138,000 in various instalments before its newly reconstituted Board, led by one Zacharia Murerwa, considered that the 31 August 2023 agreement was unlawful and unenforceable by reason of the fact that it had been induced by fraud or duress\n\nThus, initssuit the plaintiffsoughtconfirmation that it bought and paid for Fortress Hospital long back in 2014, that it is entitled to get transfer of the immovable property and all the assets associated with the hospital, and that the payment of US$138,000 aforesaid that it had made to the defendants allegedly under an unlawful agreement, should be refunded.\n\nKereke challenged the claim.\n\nHe said it took more than 8  years for the defendants to finally have access to the deposit of US$700,000 aforesaid.\n\nHe also said the defendants have never received the balance of US$100,000.\n\nHe said on the plaintiffs instructions, Muza andNyapadi diverted the plaintiffs payment for something else.\n\nKereke also said the amount of $650,000 allegedly paid by the plaintiff through Madzika, or his trusts, allegedly towards the assets for Fortress Hospital, was never received by the defendants.\n\nKereke said the pleadings are inelegant.\n\nHe also said it has been quite a mission to stitch together a coherent narrative from the divergent versions of the facts as presented by the parties.\n\nThe High Court found no favour with the plaintiff, ruling that Kereke had managed to defend himself well.\n\n",

Some parents struggle with recent fee hikes and added expenses for winter uniforms. Govt directive is clear: no child should be sent home due to fee non-payment, Mangwana wrote.\n\nMangwana added that while the government recognises that the fees contract is between the school and the parent, schools should not exploit this position.\n\nSchools cannot use a childs future to extort money out of a parent, much to the detriment of the learner. Schools have other means of debt recovery at their disposal, the same way as any other creditor, he said.\n\nThe issue was not only confined to Chegutu, as the same was noted in some government schools nationwide.\n\nIn an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Obert Msaraure, President of the Amalgamated Rural Teachers Union of Zimbabwe (ARTUZ) said that the government was failing the education system.As we predicted, our schools are once again opening to chaos. Chaos born out of policy inconsistencies, neglect of education, corruption and incompetence. It is strange for the government to be complaining about learners being sent back home for failing to pay fees, Masaraure said.\n\nMasaraure reminded the government of its constitutional duties, adding that even Zanu PFs previous election manifestos were predicated on free education for learners.Government is responsible for providing state-funded education in line with s75 of the constitution and our more elaborate Education Act. The election manifesto of the ruling ZANU PF party for two thousand and twenty-three spoke to state-funded education.\n\nGovernment should be releasing education grants to all learners across the country on an equity basis. Issuing instructions to heads not to send back learners is cynical, cruel and hypocritical. Public schools do not operate in the air. Just like the elite schools where ministers children get elite education, our public schools need teaching and learning materials.\n\n",

Our hospitals are places of healing and revitalization. First-class health facilities and cutting-edge hospital infrastructure are a leadership task, Chamisa wrote on X.\n\nOpposition leader Nelson Chamisa\n\nHe continued: The tone is set at the top. A country takes the shape of its leadership. Zimbabwe will be known for medical tourism. We will be renowned as a healing nation. Yes, a healthy nation and a healed people. It is possible. We will do it.\n\nZimbabwes top government and Zanu-PF officials have long faced criticism for neglecting the public health sector while seeking superior healthcare abroad.\n\nAcross the border in South Africa, Zimbabweans seeking healthcare are facing increasing resentment from local healthcare workers, who accuse them of straining already stretched resources.\n\n",
