            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA HARARE woman, who is at the centre of an adulterous affair, openly defended her lover in court, testifying against her estranged husband whom she branded a rapist and bully.\n\nNyashadzashe Munyaradzi Maphosa, whose husband Dingaani Thomas Mbondiya is suing Christon Chiridza for adultery damages, told the court she had filed for divorce in 2022 (HCHF7305/22) after enduring abuse, humiliation, and degrading treatment at the hands of her husband.Thomas is accusing Chiridza of wrecking her marriage.However, the woman at the centre of the matter, Maphosa, testified that Mbondiya would often come home drunk and force her to have sex with him, insult her in front of visitors, and even call her mother a witch.She added that when intoxicated, he would urinate and vomit on himself, leaving her to clean up.Her explosive evidence prompted Mbondiyas lawyer, Dube-Tachiona, to object, arguing that the testimony unfairly attacked her clients character and was irrelevant to the adultery damages claim.But Justice Christopher Dube-Banda dismissed the objections, ruling that the evidence was both relevant and admissible.The defendant has a right to present evidence of the character of the plaintiff to dispute liability or in mitigation of damages, the judge ruled.To uphold these objections would result in an injustice and will destroy the very basis upon which the justice system rests.Mbondiya is seeking damages from Chiridza, claiming that his affair with Maphosa during the subsistence of their civil marriage under the Marriage Act caused the total collapse of their union.Chiridza, however, has relied on Maphosas testimony to argue that her marriage had already broken down due to her husbands abusive conduct.The judge stressed that the court must hear the full circumstances of the marriage before deciding whether adultery was indeed the cause of its collapse.The evidence of this witness about the cause of the breakdown of her marriage to the plaintiff is relevant and admissible. There is no rule of evidence that excludes it, he held.He further clarified that while the testimony might cast Mbondiya in a bad light, it was allowed under Section 33(a) of the Civil Evidence Act [Chapter 8:01], which permits character evidence in damages claims where reputation is directly at issue.This is not an issue of admissibility but of weight, Justice Dube-Banda said. Evidence is either admissible or inadmissible. It is only after it has been admitted that the issue of its persuasiveness arises.The ruling paves the way for Chiridzas defence to hinge on Maphosas explosive account, shifting blame for the marriage collapse from adultery to her husbands alleged abuse.\n\nNyashadzashe Munyaradzi Maphosa, whose husband Dingaani Thomas Mbondiya is suing Christon Chiridza for adultery damages, told the court she had filed for divorce in 2022 (HCHF7305/22) after enduring abuse, humiliation, and degrading treatment at the hands of her husband.\n\nThomas is accusing Chiridza of wrecking her marriage.However, the woman at the centre of the matter, Maphosa, testified that Mbondiya would often come home drunk and force her to have sex with him, insult her in front of visitors, and even call her mother a witch.She added that when intoxicated, he would urinate and vomit on himself, leaving her to clean up.Her explosive evidence prompted Mbondiyas lawyer, Dube-Tachiona, to object, arguing that the testimony unfairly attacked her clients character and was irrelevant to the adultery damages claim.But Justice Christopher Dube-Banda dismissed the objections, ruling that the evidence was both relevant and admissible.The defendant has a right to present evidence of the character of the plaintiff to dispute liability or in mitigation of damages, the judge ruled.To uphold these objections would result in an injustice and will destroy the very basis upon which the justice system rests.Mbondiya is seeking damages from Chiridza, claiming that his affair with Maphosa during the subsistence of their civil marriage under the Marriage Act caused the total collapse of their union.Chiridza, however, has relied on Maphosas testimony to argue that her marriage had already broken down due to her husbands abusive conduct.The judge stressed that the court must hear the full circumstances of the marriage before deciding whether adultery was indeed the cause of its collapse.The evidence of this witness about the cause of the breakdown of her marriage to the plaintiff is relevant and admissible.

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nTreasury has delayed the release of US$27.5 million earmarked for the purchase of cancer machines, leaving Zimbabwes two largest referral hospitals, Parirenyatwa Group of Hospitals in Harare and Mpilo Central Hospital in Bulawayo, without life-saving equipment for over three years.\n\nHealth and Child Care Minister Douglas Mombeshora told Parliament this week that despite the Health Ministry having completed procurement paperwork and signed contracts with suppliers, Treasury has yet to pay the required deposit.\n\nAs the Health Ministry, we have awarded tenders to two companies for Parirenyatwa and Mpilo hospitals. All in all, we spent US$27.5 million. We submitted to Treasury papers for them to pay the 30% deposit as per the agreement and in accordance with the suppliers instructions. Contracts have since been signed.\n\nIt is now more than two months since we signed the agreements. Therefore, it is now up to the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development and Investment Promotion to pay for the machines so that they can be installed, said Mombeshora.\n\nHe added that suppliers had promised to install the equipment within 36 weeks, raising hopes that the machines would be operational before the end of the year.\n\nZimbabwe has recorded over 3,000 annual cancer deaths since 2014, according to the National Cancer Registry, with cases of colorectal cancer particularly on the rise. Zaka South MP Clemence Chiduwa raised concern over the lack of facilities for diagnosis.\n\nCancer cases are on the increase and one such cancer is colorectal cancer, which affects people who are mainly above the age of 45. What is the government policy on the prevention and early detection of colon cancer? Do we have any public facilities where we can get colonoscopy services (check-up service for diagnosis)? Chiduwa asked.\n\nMombeshora admitted the health system is under strain. Colon cancer is one of the top cancers in the country, maybe in the top four cancers that are affecting our population, he said.\n\nHe also cited shortages of specialists and diagnostic equipment in district hospitals, noting that government has turned to the Sugar Tax for funding.\n\nAs you may be aware, a Sugar Tax has been introduced to help fund cancer-treating and diagnostic equipment. In Phase 1, we have done tenders for the procurement of treatment equipment and in Phase 2, we are now going to procure diagnostic equipment. Every hospital should have a CT scan, an MRI and an ultrasound scan, Mombeshora said.\n\nOpposition MP for Chiredzi Central, Blessing Ropafadzo Makumire, criticised the delays despite government already collecting the Sugar Tax.\n\nThe Sugar Tax which is supposed to be used for the procurement of cancer machines, started being collected last year in January, yet to date, we have not received any machines that have been procured, which suggests that the government lacks urgency in solving this problem. How long will it take for the government to procure this equipment? What is preventing and causing the delay? Makumire said.\n\nMombeshora responded that US$30.3 million was available as of December 2024 and that procurement would begin with Parirenyatwa and Mpilo, where machines have been down for the past three years.\n\n",
