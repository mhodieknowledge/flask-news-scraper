            "content": "By BBC News\n\nUNITED States President Donald Trump has denied that he is considering a third presidential term, a move which experts agree is banned under the US Constitution.\n\nIll be an eight-year president, Ill be a two-term president. I always thought that was very important, Trump told NBCs Meet the Press with Kristen Welker in an interview that aired on Sunday.Trump, 78, has previously said that he was not joking about wanting to serve a third, or even fourth, term as US president.He later said his statements were meant to troll the fake news media.His company, The Trump Organization, has been selling Trump 2028 hats, fuelling armchair speculation that he may seek to remain in office after his second term ends in January 2029.In the interview, recorded from his residence in Florida on Friday, Trump said that he has had many requests from people asking that he consider seeking to remain in office.So many people want me to do it, Trump said, just days after celebrating his first 100 days of his second term.Its something that, to the best of my knowledge, youre not allowed to do. I dont know if thats constitutional that theyre not allowing you to do it or anything else, Trump said.He added that there are many people selling the 2028 hat.But this is not something Im looking to do, he said, going on to list Republicans who could take his place, including Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.The Constitutions 22nd Amendment says that no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.Changing the Constitution would require a two-thirds approval from both the Senate and the House of Representatives, as well as approval from three-quarters of the countrys state-level governments.However, some Trump supporters suggest there is a loophole in the Constitution, which has been untested in court.Asked by NBC whether anyone has approached him with these theories, Trump deflected, answering that in a capacity of being a big supporter, many people have said different things.Tariff transition periodDuring the interview, Trump also rejected criticism of his handling of the economy.Look, yeah. Everythings OK, he said after his tariff plan roiled international economies, leading the US economy to shrink for the first time since 2022.I said, this is a transition period. I think were going to do fantastically, he added.Asked if the US economy may continue to shrink, he responded: Anything can happen. But I think were going to have the greatest economy in the history of our country.He later added that there is a chance that tariffs may be permanent, telling the interviewer: If somebody thought they were going to come off the table, why would they build in the United States?Trump also denied that Americans will need to prepare to see fewer goods for sale in shops, as the trade war continues.No, Im not saying that. Im just saying they dont need to have 30 dolls. They can have three, he said.They dont need to have 250 pencils. They can have five.Trump was asked about the Fifth Amendment right to due process under the law, which guarantees certain rights to people accused of committing of a crime.Critics have said his deportation plan has violated this process, and that his administration has removed people who have not yet been charged with any crime, and therefore have not had any opportunity to present a legal defence.Dont you need to uphold the Constitution of the United States as president? asked Welker, suggesting that he could be disregarding the presidential oath of office, which requires him to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution.Trump responded: I dont know. I have to respond by saying, again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said.Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the White House must work to facilitate the return of a migrant who was accidentally deported to jail in El Salvador. The Trump administration has argued that they lack the authority to force the Central American country to return him to the US.Trump said that he could not rule out using military force to annex Greenland, but suggested that he is not considering a military attack on Canada in order to force the US northern neighbour to become the 51st US state.I dont see it with Canada, Trump said, days after Canadian voters chose Liberal Party leader Mark Carney as their prime minister, in a stunning rejection of the Conservative Party.They think we are going to protect them, and really we are, Trump continued.But the truth is, they dont carry their full share, and its unfair to the United States and our taxpayers.Carney is scheduled to visit Trump at the White House on Tuesday.Defends immigration emergency declarationTrump was also asked about his decision to declare an immigration state of emergency on his first day in office, and whether the border is now secure.We have the most secure border weve ever had, he said, leading Welker to question why the emergency declaration remains in place, after immigration figures showed that illegal crossings have plummeted to the lowest levels in decades.He claimed that the emergency is in the court system, not at the border.The big emergency right now is that we have thousands of people that we want to take out, and we have some judges that want everybody to go to court, he said.Its an overall emergency on immigration, Trump told NBC, adding that he has no plans to lift the order in the near future.\n\nIll be an eight-year president, Ill be a two-term president. I always thought that was very important, Trump told NBCs Meet the Press with Kristen Welker in an interview that aired on Sunday.\n\nTrump, 78, has previously said that he was not joking about wanting to serve a third, or even fourth, term as US president.He later said his statements were meant to troll the fake news media.His company, The Trump Organization, has been selling Trump 2028 hats, fuelling armchair speculation that he may seek to remain in office after his second term ends in January 2029.In the interview, recorded from his residence in Florida on Friday, Trump said that he has had many requests from people asking that he consider seeking to remain in office.So many people want me to do it, Trump said, just days after celebrating his first 100 days of his second term.Its something that, to the best of my knowledge, youre not allowed to do.

I have to respond by saying, again, I have brilliant lawyers that work for me, and they are going to obviously follow what the Supreme Court said.Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that the White House must work to facilitate the return of a migrant who was accidentally deported to jail in El Salvador.

I dont know if thats constitutional that theyre not allowing you to do it or anything else, Trump said.He added that there are many people selling the 2028 hat.But this is not something Im looking to do, he said, going on to list Republicans who could take his place, including Vice-President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio.The Constitutions 22nd Amendment says that no person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.Changing the Constitution would require a two-thirds approval from both the Senate and the House of Representatives, as well as approval from three-quarters of the countrys state-level governments.However, some Trump supporters suggest there is a loophole in the Constitution, which has been untested in court.Asked by NBC whether anyone has approached him with these theories, Trump deflected, answering that in a capacity of being a big supporter, many people have said different things.Tariff transition periodDuring the interview, Trump also rejected criticism of his handling of the economy.Look, yeah.

Everythings OK, he said after his tariff plan roiled international economies, leading the US economy to shrink for the first time since 2022.I said, this is a transition period. I think were going to do fantastically, he added.Asked if the US economy may continue to shrink, he responded: Anything can happen. But I think were going to have the greatest economy in the history of our country.He later added that there is a chance that tariffs may be permanent, telling the interviewer: If somebody thought they were going to come off the table, why would they build in the United States?Trump also denied that Americans will need to prepare to see fewer goods for sale in shops, as the trade war continues.No, Im not saying that.

Tambwera added the extras once again.\n\nCaptain Hilton Mudariki, marking his 51st Test cap, added a third with a trademark dart from close range, converted clinically by Tambwera.\n\nAlthough Zambia struck back with a converted try of their own, the Sables remained in full control. They ran in several more tries before the break, showcasing fluid backline movement and relentless forward pressure. The halftime score stood at 2810, with Zimbabwe firmly in the drivers seat.\n\nThe second half saw the Sables explode into another gear, scoring an avalanche of tries as fatigue and defensive frailties took their toll on the visitors. Zimbabwes depth off the bench maintained the pace, as the scoreline ballooned past 50.\n\nBy the final whistle, Zimbabwe had racked up ten tries in total, with Tambwera converting most of them, including several from difficult angles. Zambia managed one more try in the second half, but it was a mere consolation as the Sables finished the job emphatically at 7015.\n\nAfter the match, captain Mudariki praised the teams effort but acknowledged room for refinement:\n\nSuper happy to have such a great win in front of the home fans. Its good to see all the work we put in translating to the scoreboard.\n\nIt was a good win but we made a lot of errors on the field and had some discipline issues on the park, but these are things we will easily fix.\n\nPlaying at home is always the best, especially when we also get a win. The home fans played a huge role today.\n\nWith a 55-point margin, Zimbabwe takes a massive advantage into the second leg and look well poised to retain their dominance in this regional rivalry.\n\n",

Many are walking long distances to their workstations, while others are forced to live in overcrowded single-room accommodations with their families due to an inability to pay rent. This is not only unacceptable it is pathetic and dehumanising, said Dongo\n\nThe association urged government to urgently review nurses salary to at least $840, a figure reflective of the pre-October 2018 exchange rate.\n\nWe urgently call on the government to review and adjust nurses salaries to a minimum of US$840, a figure that reflects the pre-October 2018 value, when the exchange rate was 1:1.\n\nSuch a revision is critical to alleviating the chronic underpayment and harsh living conditions being endured by our health workers, said Dongo.\n\nHe also indicated the critical shortage of medical equipment and resources in hospitals, which he says has led to public blame directed at nurses for inadequate patient care.\n\nFurthermore, the working conditions in public health institutions are dire. Most hospital buildings are dilapidated and no longer fit for purpose.\n\nThere is a severe lack of medical resources, equipment, and essential drugs. In the absence of these tools, nurses are being unfairly blamed by the public for delays and inefficiencies, Dongo added.\n\nThey are overburdened by improvisation, leading to long queues, slow service delivery, and increased suffering of patients. This also results in heightened exposure to infections and extreme fatigue for the nurses, said Dongo\n\nHe also added that, The chronic shortage of staff is worsening the situation, with the nurse-to-patient ratio as high as 1:20 or even 1:30 in some wards. This is unmanageable and endangers both patient care and nurse wellbeing.\n\nWe demand that the government urgently recruit more staff and consider the reintroduction of locum arrangements, allowing nurses on leave or off-duty to work additional shifts for fair compensation.\n\nFuthermore, ZINA has also raised concerns over the delay in issuing academic credentials to nurses upon completion of their training, affecting over 4,000 nurses, who are unable to secure employment as a result.\n\nWe are also gravely concerned about the violation of nurses rights. It has come to our attention that nurses who have completed their mandatory bonding are being denied their diplomas and verification letters documents that are necessary for them to seek employment, locally or internationally.\n\nThis is a blatant infringement on their right to choose their employer, and we demand immediate release of these documents to all eligible nurses. Over 4,000 nurses are currently affected by this injustice.\n\nAnother pressing issue is the governments unreasonable rental charges for nurses staying in government accommodation. Nurses have been charged up to US$120 per month for basic rooms, and shockingly, these deductions are made from the US dollar component of their salaries, not the ZiG portion, said Dongo.\n\nThe government has also been urged to align with international labour practices.\n\nLastly, we call for alignment with international labor practices for shift work. Nurses often work long, irregular hours and should be entitled to fewer working days per week to reduce fatigue and the risk of occupational exposure to infections. This model in standard practice in many countries and must be adopted here to safeguard both nurses and the patients they serve, said Dongo.\n\n",

            "content": "By IOL News\n\nTHE Western Cape Legislatures Standing Committee on Infrastructure was given a sobering and detailed account of the George building collapse during a live briefing on Friday.\n\nThe Garden Route District Municipality and the George Municipality reflected on the devastating event that claimed lives and injured many more.\n\nThe incident, which occurred just after 2pm on May 6, 2024, saw a multi-storey building under construction on Victoria Street collapse in what responders described as a rare pancake collapse, where floors fall directly atop one another.\n\nSpeaking at the briefing, Head of Disaster Management for the Garden Route District Municipality, Gerard Otto shared the agonising realities of the response operation.\n\nI dont think anything fully prepares you for an incident like this. Having the plan just makes the gap less of what you didnt plan for and what youve got planned.\n\nIt took 260 hours, from 6 to 17 May, for rescue teams to comb through the rubble, searching for survivors among 62 confirmed victims, most of whom were foreign nationals.\n\nOnly 16 of the deceased were South African citizens. The rest were Mozambican, Zimbabwean, Malawian, Lesotho nationals, some undocumented, Otto revealed.\n\nOne of the most remarkable moments came 118 hours into the rescue, when survivor Gabriel Gumba was pulled from the rubble virtually unharmed.\n\nThat lifted the spirit to say, Okay, lets carry on, lets do even more, said Otto.\n\nThe response involved more than a thousand personnel and volunteers, including specialised rescue technicians, emergency medical teams, construction workers, and canine units.\n\nHowever, the operation faced significant logistical and emotional challenges. Response equipment had to be transported from Worcester, resulting in delays of up to five hours for critical tools.\n\nAdditionally, language barriers complicated the provision of psychosocial support for victims, while inaccurate or missing records from contractors made it nearly impossible to track the workers involved.\n\nGeorge Municipality Fire Chief Neels Barnard described the moment he reached the scene.\n\nWas it just a structural collapse of one wall? Or was it the whole building? Its only when you reach the disaster site that you can see what has really happened. Even in the Western Cape, we have never experienced a tragedy of this scale before, said Barnard.\n\nCoordinated through a Multi-Agency Centre (MAC), the operation implemented triage colour-coding, acoustic detection devices, and forensic identification methods including tattoos and social media photos.\n\nNGOs, churches, and the Department of Social Development offered support to grieving families and rescue workers alike.\n\nThis was not just a government response, it was a whole-of-society approach, Otto said.\n\nOfficials also credited past disaster experiences, including the COVID-19 pandemic and the 2017 Knysna fires, for helping establish functional cluster systems.\n\nEveryone knew their roles, Otto added.\n\nThat intergovernmental coordination saved lives.\n\n",
