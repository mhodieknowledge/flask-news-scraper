Africa must not just mine data, but also mint intelligence, the machine targets to support applications in healthcare, life sciences, higher education, and research, said Niels Van Rees, Co-Founder of MDCS.AI.\n\nIn addition to using modular technologies to recycle heat and relying on natural river water for cooling, the plant will be connected to a new 2,500km fiber optic backbone that connects Uganda to international cables via Kenya and Tanzania.\n\nIn July, it was reported that much like the Aeonian Project, Project Mufungi via Cassava Technologies, owned by Strive Masiyiwa, Zimbabwes richest man, would be partnering with Nvidia to build the firstArtificial Intelligence (AI) factory in Africa.\n\nThis initiative encompasses setting up Nvidias high-performance AI processing infrastructure in Cassavas data centers across Africa.\n\nEgypts Kenya, Morocco, and Nigeria will be added after South Africa in June 2025.\n\nCollaborating with Nvidia gives us the advanced computing capabilities needed to drive Africas AI innovation while strengthening the continents digital independence, Masiyiwa said in a press release.\n\nCassava Technologies said back in April that it had intentions ofinvesting up to $720 millionin the AI plant.\n\nThe objective of the project is to provide African companies, researchers, and startups with local access to cutting-edge AI power so they may create their own AI models and solutions.\n\nAs per its official website, Synectics Technologies is developing The Aeonian Project, which is a hybrid Tier-4 Plus (4+) off-grid green energy regional Hyperscale Data & High-Performance Computing Centre (DHPC) powered by 100MW of excess pre-transmission electricity from the government-owned 600MW Karuma Hydro Power Plant (K-HPP) in Uganda.\n\nTo connect the facility to the companys headquarters in Kampala, for remote surveillance, and to the submarine cable in Kenya for global connection, data is sent via two (2) core dark fiber optic cables that are leased.\n\nData transfer between the two neighboring landlocked nations will be facilitated by the cables alternate arm.\n\nColocation, blockchain, data storage, artificial intelligence, and on-demand cloud services are the areas in which the suggested service provider falls.\n\nAdditionally, existing data centers in the area will get Disaster Recovery Services (DRaaS) from the Center.\n\n",

            "content": "Midfielder hasnt featured for Luton this season\n\nLutonboss Matt Bloomfield has confirmed that midfielder Marvelous Nakamba will be back in contention for the Hatters following his first outing of the season forZimbabwelast week, although faces a real battle to regain a place in the side.\n\nThe 31-year-old won his 30th cap when playing 74 minutes for the Warriors as they as they lost 1-0 to Benin in their World Cup qualifier on Friday at the Stade de lAmiti, although didnt feature in their 1-0 home loss to Rwanda at the National Sports Stadium on Tuesday, a result which left Zimbabwe firmly rooted at the bottom of their group table.\n\nNakamba is yet to play for Luton this term, or be involved in any first team squads, as with rumours of a move away surrounding his pre-season at Kenilworth Road, he has been restricted to just one outing for the U21s. However, with thoughts of an exit ended following the closure of the transfer window last Monday evening, it means that the experienced player will now remain in Bedfordshire until January at least, with Bloomfield stating he will come into consideration for the Hatters League One fixtures.\n\nAsked just how close he is fitness-wise to being able to do so, the Town chief said: Hes managed to get himself through 90 minutes for Zimbabwe so hes a lot closer than what he was before which is great. He was really keen to go on international duty, weve had some good competition in that midfield area but a fit and ready Marvelous Nakamba is obviously a plus for us as well, so hell come back into the group.\n\nWell welcome him back and look forward to seeing him, although competition for places is fierce in the middle of the pitch. I think George (Saville) has done particularly well, Clicker (Jordan Clark) is evergreen, Zacks (Nelson) done great the last couple of games, weve got Lamine (Fanne) as well and Walshy (Liam Walsh), so competition is fierce but Marv comes back into the thinking.\n\nWith Nakamba expected back from his country later in the week, on how hungry he was to still be a part of the Hatters squad, as the former Club Brugge and Aston Villa player, who has made 57 appearances since joining the club in January 2023, last starting for Town in their 2-0 defeat to fierce rivals Watford in February, injury restricting him to just one other sub appearance at Derby County in the run-in after that, Bloomfield added: Marv has had some interest, as a number of our players have had.\n\nTheres so many different situations that weve spoken about a number of times, but hes still with us now, so hes our player and hell be ready to contribute. Hes got to get back safely from international duty and we welcome him back into training on Friday and hell be ready to compete. Hes had, weve spoken about before, a bit of a slow summer, working his way back and its great for us and for him that hes gone and played 90 minutes for Zimbabwe. He was obviously really keen to play for his country as he always is, so another proud moment for him and good for us to have him back to fitness.\n\n",

            "content": "By Jonisayi Maromo, IOL\n\nA 21-year-old man was scheduled to appear before the Pretoria Magistrates Court on Thursday after allegedly stabbing to death 24-year-old Liberty Shawn Wazara during an altercation reportedly linked to a woman.\n\nGauteng provincial police spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel Mavela Masondo toldIOLthat the murder-accused 21-year-old man was arrested after handing himself over to police this week.\n\nThe 21-year-old suspect handed himself in at the police station. He was then charged with murder. He is expected to appear before the Pretoria Magistrates Court on Thursday, 11 September 2025, said Masondo.\n\nHe confirmed that the murder case was opened at Wonderboompoort police station in Pretoria, and the matter is under investigation.\n\nFamily members of the murdered victim described Shawn as a humble young man, who was deeply in love with the woman he met in Pretoria in December.\n\nI recall vividly that the love relationship between my cousin Shawn and her girlfriend (name withheld by IOL) started on a high. They seemed to be deeply in love with each other. I can tell you with certainty that Shawn really loved the woman and would do many things to show his love. The two quickly moved in together after they met in December, Shawns uncle, Everton Wazara, spoke to IOL.\n\nShawn Wazara during happier times with her girlfriend. Image: IOL\n\nThe two moved into an apartment in Mayville, in Pretoria. However, the woman maintained another romantic relationship with another man, who later showed up at the apartment on Saturday around midnight and (allegedly) brutally killed my cousin.\n\nRight now, Shawns mother is inconsolable since we broke the news to her. She has been crying nonstop. I do not know what I will say to my sister, he said.\n\nEverton said the relationship between Shawn and his girlfriend had started off promising, but cracks soon appeared.\n\nOn Saturday, I am told Shawn visited her girlfriends workplace, a popular pub in Pretoria. She works as a bartender. They later went to their home, but there was an argument between the couple, with Shawn asking her where her phone was. The context is that Shawn had somehow become informed about the other boyfriend. The lady insisted she had left her phone at work, Everton narrated.\n\nAs the fight escalated, the girlfriend contacted her other boyfriend, who then rushed to the scene. The man rocked up on a bike, just before midnight on Saturday, and the lady went out to talk to him. The man was insisting on taking the woman away. As someone who truly loved the woman, Shawn also went out in an effort to persuade the woman, but that was when he was repeatedly stabbed. He had several deep stab wounds.\n\nEverton described the murder scene as devastating.\n\nEven though I knew the girlfriend well and had maintained contact with her, from the early days of the relationship, I am still asking myself why she never contacted me, as a representative of the family, to alert us that Shawn had been brutally murdered. We only became aware of the death from a Facebook post made by (socialite and Gauteng-based lawyer) Moreboys Munetsi, who was looking for family members of a murdered man.\n\nRight now, we are appealing for justice for Shawn. He did not deserve to be killed like an animal. For what? Some witnesses saw everything taking place. We are grateful for the work done by the South African Police Service (SAPS) detective so far, who has also been supportive in our quest for answers. We will be in court today (Thursday) so that we can come face to face with the killer, he said.\n\nEmmanuel Mahamba was run over by a Ford Ranger, and killed in Rivonia, Sandton, earlier this year Image: Supplied\n\nIn April,IOL published another story of Emmanuel Mahamba, who was brutally murdered in a horrific incidentthat sent shockwaves in South Africa.\n\nIn the video, widely shared on social media, Mahamba is seen seated on the road while a Ford Ranger runs over him repeatedly. He died at the scene.\n\nIn a previous update, Gauteng police said they were still searching for the motorist implicated in the brutal death of a man following a heated dispute, linked to a love triangle.\n\nMahambas murder attracted international news headlines, with many social media users expressing shock over the gratuitous violence and murder.\n\n",
