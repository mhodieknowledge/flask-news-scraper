It can be waived or forfeited where the beneficiary is at fault.\n\nIn dismissing the application, the judges acknowledged the importance of maintaining the integrity of the disciplinary process, warning against setting a precedent that would allow employees to sidestep disciplinary consequences.\n\nIf participants were allowed to pull out of these processes without consequence and subsequently seek a review the whole labour dispute resolution mechanism would face certain collapse, the judgment read.\n\n",

            "url": "https://www.newzimbabwe.com/why-zimbabweans-rue-plan-to-ditch-us-dollar/",
            "content": "The East African\n\nZimbabwes plans to drop the US dollar in five years is already causing jitters in an economy that has suffered nearly two decades of currency volatility and bouts of record hyperinflation.\n\nHarare has set 2030 as the target to stop using the US dollar, which has been the dominant foreign currency for the past 16 years, after it was forced to abandon its own.\n\nZimbabwe first announced on August 6, 2024 that its Cabinet had approved a roadmap to adopt the Zimbabwe Gold (ZiG) as the sole currency. The gold-backed ZiG was launched last year, the countrys sixth attempt at mooting a stable currency in 25 years.\n\nThe central bank concedes that businesses are nervous about the plan to return to a mono-currency regime, so much that banks are now avoiding long-term lending beyond that date.\n\nJohn Mushayavanhu, Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) governor, said he would announce a comprehensive de-dollarisation roadmap in November, in what is seen as a desperate attempt to calm nerves.\n\nDr Mushayavanhu said the roadmap would focus on the need to preserve foreign currency accounts and the existing US dollar-denominated contracts, with considerations made to ensure business continuity and certainty.\n\nThe central bank says it is working on modernising the ZiG banknotes with re-designing and producing improved banknotes to increase the acceptance of the new currency.The roadmap will undoubtedly encapsulate the need to maintain the current stability, preserve the foreign currency accounts and existing USD-dominated contracts, Dr Mushayavanhu said as he presented the 2025 mid-term monetary policy statement.\n\nConsideration will always be made to ensure that there is business continuity and certainty.The Confederation of Zimbabwe Industries (CZI), the countrys largest business grouping with membership from the manufacturing, trade, transport, information technology, education and professional services, said the success of the de-dollarisation strategy would hinge on controlling inflation.Low levels of inflation will help build trust in the currency, which might also encourage greater usage of ZiG in transactions, CZI said. This could also boost the likelihood of a gradual de-dollarisation process leading to a ZiG mono-currency regime by 2030. The high annual inflation level creates pricing uncertainty, making it difficult for businesses to set prices, forecast costs or even negotiate contracts.\n\nThe team advised the authorities to urgently introduce measures to increase demand for the ZiG and institute other reforms if the de-dollarisation plan is to succeed.The mission emphasised the need to continue strengthening the monetary and foreign currency market framework in line with IMF staff recommendations, said Wojciech Maliszewski, head of the IMF team.\n\nThis should be complemented by measures to enhance the demand for ZiG in the domestic economy- most notably, increasing the share of Treasurys operations (revenues and expenditures) in ZiG. To reduce any uncertainty weighing on financial intermediation, the authorities should provide more clarity on the implications of the transition plan, including clarifying that the use of a mono-currency will be limited to domestic transactions, allowing for bank deposits to remain dominated in both currencies.\n\nOver a year since the introduction of the ZiG, the country is still heavily reliant on the US dollar, with the central bank indicating that only 40 percent of transactions are in local currency.\n\nEconomic analysts say the new currency is being undermined by the same factors that thwarted previous efforts to re-establish a sole currency. These include a lack of confidence in the banking sector and the local economy, as well as the large scale of the unregulated informal economy, which according to the World Bank is the largest in the world.\n\nJohn Lagat, Imara Asset Management CEO, said the ZiG was destined for extinction just like the other currencies before it because it was being rendered irrelevant by the market.There is so little ZiG around  thanks to the very tight monetary policy  that it is easier simply to use US dollar cash or bank cards. We continue to believe that way too much time and energy is spent on dealing with and discussing the ZiG, despite its limited use, that it would be better simply to scrap it and move on, he said.\n\nHe added that the ZiG was largely used in Harare while in the southern parts of the country people favoured the South African rand.On our recent travels around, it would appear that the South African rand is the favoured currency in the southern parts of Zimbabwe, whilst the US dollar is king further north. Indeed, it is only in the capital Harare that the ZiG is used to any extent. The civil servants continue to receive part of their remuneration in ZiG, which they attempt to spend in the formal shops since the formal economy has no use for it.\n\nAccording to the IMF, only four out of 85 countries that were surveyed during the 1980 to 2001 period succeeded in de-dollarisation, which makes Zimbabwes attempt to return to a mono-currency regime an uphill task.\n\nZimbabwe started facing acute currency problems in 1997 when the local dollar crashed dramatically that year after Robert Mugabes regime paid unbudgeted pensions to former fighters of the countrys liberation struggle.\n\nThe crisis deepened when Zimbabwe sent troops to the Democratic Republic of Congo to protect Laurent Kabilas under siege regime.\n\nA chaotic land reform programme that began in the year 2000 proved to be the final nail on the coffin for the local currency as it led to the countrys international isolation and economic collapse.\n\nBy the time Mugabes government abandoned the Zimbabwe dollar in 2009 when the inflation rate peaked at 79.6 billion percent in mid-November. Hyperinflation only ended after the adoption of the US dollar.\n\n",

Failure to pay monthly rentals is a serious breach of the agreement of lease which mandates City of Harare to evoke the conditions of lease and recover holding costs from the same.\n\nNotwithstanding the availability or none of the lease agreement, council shall not be prejudiced in its rights to recover holding costs from the lessee for breach of mutual understanding, read the notice.\n\nThe notice comes on the back of Harare City, on the drive to recover money it is being owed by tenants leasing their properties.\n\nHowever, in Mbare, Harare City is under pressure to renovate the flats which are becoming uninhabitable.\n\nLast year, the High Court ordered Harare City Council to renovate the flats to match decent living standards. The City fathers have appealed the judgement.\n\nIn an interview with NewZimbabwe.com, Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA) director, Ruben Akili, said the deplorable living conditions have dissuaded tenants from paying their rentals.\n\nThese are the same flats which we had a court order for renovations. As you are aware all the flats in Mbare were supposed to be renovated. The situation in Mbare is unacceptable sewer is gushing all over and many things are just happening and many things are happening.\n\nFrom CHRAs perspective is that some residents are paying and some are not paying. Local Authority should address the fundamental problems that speaks to the reasons why residents are not paying, said Akili.\n\n",

He said: Jem, who was magnificent throughout, is now enjoying a more sedentary pace in Southfields.\n\nThe Bishop set out on 1 August with an initial target of raising 30,000 to improve education in the diocese of Matabeleland, inZimbabwe, with whichSouthwark dioceseis linked.\n\nHe had been inspired by the children and teachers he met on a visit to the region last year, where many children currently walk up to 10km to get to their nearest school  a dangerous journey which means that many, particularly girls, are unable to attend.\n\nMartinGainsborough/Diocese of SouthwarkCamping out on the Pennine Way\n\nThe money raised will help to build new schools like St Cecilias School in Lupane, which is still under construction, but already offers an education to local children.\n\nSupport along the way included a video, on the fifth day, of the Bishop of Matabeleland, the Rt Revd Cleophas Lunga, outside the cathedral with members of the Mothers Union and senior clergy of his diocese, singing heartily of journeying with Jesus.\n\nBishop Lunga said: We are delighted that you are doing a very good, good thing, not only for your spirit and body, but also for us in Matabeleland. The gifts donated would go a long way to improving the lives of the young people in the villages, he said.\n\nOnline donations have since reached 27,000, with a further 8000 donated offline. The total raised currently stands at 35,389, and further donations are welcome.\n\nDr Gainsborough concluded: I have been amazed how my run has captured peoples imagination  reflected in a huge amount of support and prayers, and incredible generosity in fundraising.\n\nTo be able to make a difference to the lives of children in our link diocese of Matabeleland so they no longer have to walk long distances to school means more than I can say and makes all the pain and heartache worth it.
