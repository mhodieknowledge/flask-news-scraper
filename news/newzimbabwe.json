            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nA SUPERVISOR at China Zhuhe Mining, identified as Zilu, has been charged with murder by police after allegedly killing a local man, Fungai Nhau, on Thursday.\n\nIt is alleged Zilu fired live ammunition at the deceased in the fatal shooting which occurred in Mutoko, Mashonaland East province.The mining company claims that Nhau, along with accomplices, invaded the mining premises with the intention of committing a crime, including theft. They say Zilu fired warning shots into the air to deter the would-be robbers.The mining firm further stated that Nhaus body was discovered a kilometre away from the company premises, having been abandoned by his accomplices.Zilu, the supervisor, is said to have rushed to the scene where the body was found and spoke with the deceased, who purportedly confirmed he had been injured during the attempted robbery and then deserted by his colleagues.At approximately 7am the same day, local workers on the early shift discovered a critically injured gangster about 1kilometre from the crime scene. They promptly reported the matter to Mr. Zilu, the local translator who also served as the direct supervisor.Mr. Zilu rushed to the scene immediately; upon questioning the gangster, the latter admitted to being injured during the robbery and abandoned at the scene by his accomplices. Mr. Zilu immediately arranged to report the case to the police, but unfortunately, the gangster had already passed away when the police arrived, part of the companys statement reads.However, China Zhuhe Minings version of events starkly contrasts with the police charge sheet for Zilu, thereby raising suspicion of a cover-up attempt.Accused person is an employee of Zhuhe Mining Investments, Mudzi and he is the security supervisor. On the 09th of October 2025 at around 0030hrs, the accused person was on duty when he observed the now deceased Fungai Nhau who was with his friends going towards carbon room where pregnant carbons are kept.He then suspected them to be thieves and fired ten live rounds towards the direction of the now deceased. This resulted in the bullet hitting the now deceased on the left lower back.The now deceased sustained an entry gunshot wound which resulted in the bullet lodging inside the body. The now deceased was carried by his friends for considerable distance of about a kilometre before they abandoned him.At about 0700hrs on the same day, the now deceaseds body was discovered by mine workers who then alerted the police. The body of the now deceased was conveyed to Mutoko Hospital where it was pronounced dead by a doctor. The fire arm used by the accused person in the shooting of the now deceased is held as an exhibit, part of the police charge sheet for Zilu reads.Renowned lawyer Fadzayi Mahere has questioned why the China Zhuhe Mining supervisor took the law into his own hands and why he failed to report the incident to the police for seven hours.The companys statement leaves more questions than answers. If only warning shots were fired into the air as alleged, how was a person killed? Why did the company officials take the law into their own hands instead of calling @PoliceZimbabwe?If this version is to be believed, why were the police not called for a good 7 hours yet the company officers knew theyd fired shots at people whom they spuriously conclude were robbers and gangsters? Is there any regret for the needless loss of life? Why are early Police reports suggesting the murder victim was a worker as opposed to a gangster as curiously alleged by the company?Mahere has urged the police to leave no stone unturned in their investigations, insisting that the perpetrator must face the full force of the law.The Mutoko incident highlights the ongoing tensions between local communities and Chinese investors.This is not an isolated incident; reports indicate that throughout the country, Chinese nationals are experiencing friction with local communities concerning working environments and conditions, safety protocols, and allegations of harassment.These tensions are further exacerbated by Chinese mining operations which, it is claimed, demonstrate a disregard for historical landmarks and sites of cultural significance to local populations. Recent inquiries have focused on the alleged destruction of Mutares Christmas Pass.Last week, former Cabinet Minister Fortune Chasi commented that the core issue lies not with the Chinese themselves, but with local individuals and leadership figures who are granting mining licences enabling Chinese companies to mine indiscriminately across the country, and who are failing to adequately oversee these activities within their respective jurisdictions.\n\nIt is alleged Zilu fired live ammunition at the deceased in the fatal shooting which occurred in Mutoko, Mashonaland East province.\n\nThe mining company claims that Nhau, along with accomplices, invaded the mining premises with the intention of committing a crime, including theft.

Recent inquiries have focused on the alleged destruction of Mutares Christmas Pass.Last week, former Cabinet Minister Fortune Chasi commented that the core issue lies not with the Chinese themselves, but with local individuals and leadership figures who are granting mining licences enabling Chinese companies to mine indiscriminately across the country, and who are failing to adequately oversee these activities within their respective jurisdictions.\n\nAt about 0700hrs on the same day, the now deceaseds body was discovered by mine workers who then alerted the police. The body of the now deceased was conveyed to Mutoko Hospital where it was pronounced dead by a doctor. The fire arm used by the accused person in the shooting of the now deceased is held as an exhibit, part of the police charge sheet for Zilu reads.\n\nRenowned lawyer Fadzayi Mahere has questioned why the China Zhuhe Mining supervisor took the law into his own hands and why he failed to report the incident to the police for seven hours.The companys statement leaves more questions than answers. If only warning shots were fired into the air as alleged, how was a person killed? Why did the company officials take the law into their own hands instead of calling @PoliceZimbabwe?If this version is to be believed, why were the police not called for a good 7 hours yet the company officers knew theyd fired shots at people whom they spuriously conclude were robbers and gangsters?

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nINDUSTRY and Commerce Minister, Mangaliso Ndlovu has shot down sceptics underscoring that the countrys business community must never underestimate the huge benefits they are set to derive from a de-dollarised economy.\n\nThe Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) has since tabled indications to go full scale de-dollarisation plans on the back of considerations on finding the best way forward to trim the costs of exports in a dollarised economy.\n\nThe announcement has since drawn mixed reactions from industry with players in sectors such as property already demanding a clear framework on how the measures will be implemented.\n\nAgainst the background, the Bretton Woods Institution, International Monetary Fund, recently added its voice on the matter by calling on the authorities to clarify the plans.\n\nSpeaking to NewZimbabwe.com on the sidelines of a media tour organised by the Transport and Infrastructure Development Ministry in Plumtree Friday, Ndlovu shot down the fears being expressed by sceptics, insisting that the plans will benefit industry.\n\nThey are justified to be sceptical because of where we are coming from. But talk to them today. Talk to the business people today.They will tell you that for the first time theyve kept the ZWG for no less than three months because theyve seen its stability. We have a responsibility as a government to stabilise the ZWG, he said.\n\nHe said once it is stable, those concerns will go as he insisted that business will never be competitive as long as the economy remains stuck with the US dollar.\n\nSo, when we talk about this gradual move, we have them in mind. Its not a reckless move. We know that Zimbabwe has a small population of 16 million which is too small. There is a whole 400 million in SADC (Southern African Development Community), there is COMESA (Common Markets for Eastern nd Southern Africa), there is African Continental Free Trade Area with 1.3 billion people. For us to be able to target those, we have to use our own currency. Thats what we are targeting, he said.\n\nNdlovu added that the migration will be undertaken with due considerations and safeguards as he insisted the country cannot do away with de-dollarisation.\n\n",

The funds amounting to over US$250,000 were later withdrawn and converted into cryptocurrency.The court also heard that the accused later roped in another man, only identified as Billy, to help process the illicit transactions, while EcoCash agent Blessing Julias handled some of the withdrawals.During her testimony, Madam Boss told the court that Mushambi was the one who introduced her to the E-Creator scheme.I can recall that sometime in June 2023, I was informed by Mushambi that the accused (Jiatong and Chui) wanted me to market their company, which they said was an investment platform, she said.She told the court that she and her manager, Fanwell Masunugure, met the accused at their Joina City offices.They told us they wanted us to advertise their company and invite Zimbabweans to invest through the supplied link for profit. I then advertised their company on my Facebook page together with Mushambi the same day I met them. I was paid US$700 for the services.Chikocho added that she even invested US$100 into the scheme herself and encouraged her husband and relatives to join.The E-Creator scam, which collapsed last year, left thousands counting their losses.
