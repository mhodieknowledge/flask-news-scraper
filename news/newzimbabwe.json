            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nDESPERATE Harare vendors trying to earn a living from importing and selling of second-hand clothing have defied governments directive by simply ignoring orders to leave the streets.\n\nLocal Government Minister Daniel Garwe a fortnight ago banned the importation and sale of second-hand clothes along the streets as well as trading during the night.Vendors have continued operating the streets of Harare, ignoring the order by the Minister, preferring to do business at night when municipal officers are off the streets.Some of the affected vendors who spoke to NewZimbabwe.com lamented the economic collapse, which they said had worsened over the past few months, hence were resorting to importation of goods, mainly bales of second hand clothes for resale to earn a living.We are unemployed. We need some formal jobs so that we can leave the streets. Its difficult to remain in-doors at home when you have no basics such as food, Rudo Murotsi of Mufakose said.One Leroy Kufa from Glen View Area 8, a university graduate from Class of 2015, said he had never been employed after leaving college, turning to vending since then but had managed to send his siblings to school.So, how are we going to survive? Kufa asked rhetorically.During the 2024 Local Authorities Performance Outcome feed back workshop in Harare last Thursday, Garwe reiterated the ban and ordered council officials countrywide to make sure that all cities, towns and growth points chuck off vendors by December this year.Lets just accept that we created these problems. We must be able to deal with these problems. We want to see clean cities.I want to see all the cities clean. I dont know how we are going to do it. At least by the end of this year, our cities must be clean.Everybody must be willing to come to Harare, to come to ulawayo, to go to Mutare, to go to Masvingo, from wherever they are outside our country. Lets clean our cities. This is our motto., Garwe said.Lets reintroduce the culture of cleanliness to citizens.And we also want to know that street vending and night vending are banned. Street vending and night vending are born out of the importation of second-hand clothing, which is banned. And the responsibility to remove these people from our streets and from operating at night is ours, said added.The minister took a swipe at night-vending alleging only abuse of drugs and substances takes place during the evenings along the streets of the capital city.There is no positive night vending that is taking place. Its all drugs and substance abuse behind that night vending.Who, in his rightful of mind, or in her rightful of mind, will wake up at 12 midnight or 1am and say to the wife, Im leaving, you know, Im going for shopping at 1am. Or a woman leaving her husband or boyfriend to say, look, Im sorry, I have to go. Im going for shopping now. There is nobody. So this narrative that people have nothing to do, we are messing up people, its all hogwash.We must make hard and tough decisions to clean these cities. There must be tough decisions. Both tough decisions, positive results will come out, he added.So, there is banning of second-hand clothing importation, subsequent banning of street vending, and subsequent banning of night vending.These are directives that are coming from His Excellency. We actually have a Statutory lnstrument through the Minister of Industry and Commerce to ban the importationWe dont need that anymore. We cant be in a country, or an area cant be defined by seeing people selling used clothes along the streets.Garwe said Zimbabwe cannot be a nation of people aspiring to wear second-hand clothing, adding the importation and sale of used clothes was killing the countrys cotton industry.\n\nLocal Government Minister Daniel Garwe a fortnight ago banned the importation and sale of second-hand clothes along the streets as well as trading during the night.\n\nVendors have continued operating the streets of Harare, ignoring the order by the Minister, preferring to do business at night when municipal officers are off the streets.Some of the affected vendors who spoke to NewZimbabwe.com lamented the economic collapse, which they said had worsened over the past few months, hence were resorting to importation of goods, mainly bales of second hand clothes for resale to earn a living.We are unemployed.

Its all drugs and substance abuse behind that night vending.Who, in his rightful of mind, or in her rightful of mind, will wake up at 12 midnight or 1am and say to the wife, Im leaving, you know, Im going for shopping at 1am. Or a woman leaving her husband or boyfriend to say, look, Im sorry, I have to go. Im going for shopping now. There is nobody. So this narrative that people have nothing to do, we are messing up people, its all hogwash.We must make hard and tough decisions to clean these cities. There must be tough decisions. Both tough decisions, positive results will come out, he added.So, there is banning of second-hand clothing importation, subsequent banning of street vending, and subsequent banning of night vending.These are directives that are coming from His Excellency. We actually have a Statutory lnstrument through the Minister of Industry and Commerce to ban the importationWe dont need that anymore. We cant be in a country, or an area cant be defined by seeing people selling used clothes along the streets.Garwe said Zimbabwe cannot be a nation of people aspiring to wear second-hand clothing, adding the importation and sale of used clothes was killing the countrys cotton industry.\n\nThe minister took a swipe at night-vending alleging only abuse of drugs and substances takes place during the evenings along the streets of the capital city.\n\nThere is no positive night vending that is taking place.

            "content": "SUNDAY MORNING TABLET\n\nWHY we should seek the word of the cross\n\nIn todays world, filled with challenges and uncertainties, the call to seek the face of Christ has never been more urgent. Life can feel overwhelming, and the influence of evil spirits and the devil seems to loom larger as we stray from our spiritual foundations.Yet, in the midst of this turmoil, we are reminded of the powerful promise found in Jeremiah 29:13: You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart.This verse encapsulates the essence of pursuing a relationship with Jesus Christ, the ultimate source of hope and strength.The story of Zacchaeus in Luke 19:1-10 serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of our efforts to seek Christ. Zacchaeus, a tax collector, was determined to see Jesus, even climbing a sycamore tree to catch a glimpse of Him.Interestingly, despite his efforts, it was not Zacchaeus who found Jesus first; rather, Jesus saw him. This teaches us that even our smallest attempts to seek Christ matter.When Jesus called out to Zacchaeus, saying, Hurry and come down! For I must stay at your house today, He demonstrated that He is always ready to respond to our desires for connection. Jesus sees us before we see Him, and He invites us into a relationship that transforms our lives.Jesus invites us to try me and see if I dont find favour in you. This call to test His goodness is echoed in Malachi 3:10, where we are encouraged to bring our whole selves to Him.When we seek the face of Christ, we open ourselves to the possibility of His grace and favour, enabling us to confront our challenges with renewed strength.As we invite Christ into our lives, He establishes a permanent relationship with us. This relationship empowers us to conquer our difficulties and stand firm against the adversities we face.When we put our minds and faith in Christ, we are reminded that we are not alone. He walks with us, guiding and supporting us through every trial.The call to seek the word of the cross is a call to embrace a relationship with Jesus Christ. Like Zacchaeus, let us not be discouraged by our limitations but instead be encouraged by the knowledge that every effort we make to seek Him is met with His love and grace.As we draw closer to Him, we prepare ourselves to be called children of God when He returns. Let us seek the face of Christ, for in doing so, we find our true strength and purpose.PRAYERHeavenly Father,We come before You with humble hearts, seeking Your presence and the transformative power of the cross. Thank You for the gift of Your Son, Jesus Christ, who invites us to draw near to Him. We acknowledge that in the midst of our challenges, it is easy to lose sight of You, but we desire to seek Your face with all our hearts.Lord, just as Zacchaeus climbed the sycamore tree in his pursuit of You, grant us the courage to climb beyond our fears and doubts. Help us to reach for You, knowing that even our smallest efforts are seen by You. We trust that You are always looking out for us and that Your love is eager to embrace us.As we navigate the trials of life, may we find strength in Your Word and comfort in Your promises. Teach us to rely on You, and let our faith be unwavering. Help us to recognize the influence of darkness around us and empower us to stand firm in Your light.Lord, we ask that You come into our homes and hearts, establishing a deep and lasting relationship with us. May our lives reflect Your love and grace, and may we be filled with the hope of being called Your children when You return. Remove all the tribulations and pains we find ourselves in today. Restore peace and make us rejoin all our families in love and harmony once again.In Jesus name, we pray.AMEN.\n\nIn todays world, filled with challenges and uncertainties, the call to seek the face of Christ has never been more urgent.
