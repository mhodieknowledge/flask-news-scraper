            "content": "Business Insider Africa\n\nThe Aeonian Project, which is being touted as potentially being Africas AI factory, is now set for a swift rollout, with the first phase of the deployment scheduled for the second half of next year.\n\nAt the core of the initiative, the Aeonian Project says that intends to retain critical computing power within the continent, reducing Africas dependence on foreign entities storing its data.\n\nWith its focus on AI, the project would also ensure that homegrown researchers and developers would build AI models in local languages, which would be rooted in African data, an objective that sounds all too familiar.\n\nAs seen on theKenyanWallStreet, the projects central component, the USIO, a 10MW sovereign supercomputer, was built in partnership with NVIDIA, AI infrastructure company MDCS.AI, and Automation NV of Belgium.\n\nIt will use 100MW of surplus pre-transmission electricity from the Karuma power plant in the East African country.\n\nIn the same way gold and oil once shaped economies, digital tokens will shape the next era of innovation. Africa must not just mine data, but also mint intelligence, the machine targets to support applications in healthcare, life sciences, higher education, and research, said Niels Van Rees, Co-Founder of MDCS.AI.\n\nIn addition to using modular technologies to recycle heat and relying on natural river water for cooling, the plant will be connected to a new 2,500km fiber optic backbone that connects Uganda to international cables via Kenya and Tanzania.\n\nIn July, it was reported that much like the Aeonian Project, Project Mufungi via Cassava Technologies, owned by Strive Masiyiwa, Zimbabwes richest man, would be partnering with Nvidia to build the firstArtificial Intelligence (AI) factory in Africa.\n\nThis initiative encompasses setting up Nvidias high-performance AI processing infrastructure in Cassavas data centers across Africa.\n\nEgypts Kenya, Morocco, and Nigeria will be added after South Africa in June 2025.\n\nCollaborating with Nvidia gives us the advanced computing capabilities needed to drive Africas AI innovation while strengthening the continents digital independence, Masiyiwa said in a press release.\n\nCassava Technologies said back in April that it had intentions ofinvesting up to $720 millionin the AI plant.\n\nThe objective of the project is to provide African companies, researchers, and startups with local access to cutting-edge AI power so they may create their own AI models and solutions.\n\nAs per its official website, Synectics Technologies is developing The Aeonian Project, which is a hybrid Tier-4 Plus (4+) off-grid green energy regional Hyperscale Data & High-Performance Computing Centre (DHPC) powered by 100MW of excess pre-transmission electricity from the government-owned 600MW Karuma Hydro Power Plant (K-HPP) in Uganda.\n\nTo connect the facility to the companys headquarters in Kampala, for remote surveillance, and to the submarine cable in Kenya for global connection, data is sent via two (2) core dark fiber optic cables that are leased.\n\nData transfer between the two neighboring landlocked nations will be facilitated by the cables alternate arm.\n\nColocation, blockchain, data storage, artificial intelligence, and on-demand cloud services are the areas in which the suggested service provider falls.\n\nAdditionally, existing data centers in the area will get Disaster Recovery Services (DRaaS) from the Center.\n\n",

If you recall the earlier leaders of the opposition, then MDC, they actually went to America to ask for those sanctions. Please recall. If you do not know your history, can you research on it? said Mudenda.\n\nSanctions have been a point of contention in Zimbabwean politics, with the ruling party ZANU PF using them as an excuse for the decay of the economy.\n\nThe economic ruin is marked by the comatose industry.\n\nThe government predicted to have lost millions in funding as a result of sanctions that were imposed by the United States of America and Britain.\n\n",

            "content": "Midfielder hasnt featured for Luton this season\n\nLutonboss Matt Bloomfield has confirmed that midfielder Marvelous Nakamba will be back in contention for the Hatters following his first outing of the season forZimbabwelast week, although faces a real battle to regain a place in the side.\n\nThe 31-year-old won his 30th cap when playing 74 minutes for the Warriors as they as they lost 1-0 to Benin in their World Cup qualifier on Friday at the Stade de lAmiti, although didnt feature in their 1-0 home loss to Rwanda at the National Sports Stadium on Tuesday, a result which left Zimbabwe firmly rooted at the bottom of their group table.\n\nNakamba is yet to play for Luton this term, or be involved in any first team squads, as with rumours of a move away surrounding his pre-season at Kenilworth Road, he has been restricted to just one outing for the U21s. However, with thoughts of an exit ended following the closure of the transfer window last Monday evening, it means that the experienced player will now remain in Bedfordshire until January at least, with Bloomfield stating he will come into consideration for the Hatters League One fixtures.\n\nAsked just how close he is fitness-wise to being able to do so, the Town chief said: Hes managed to get himself through 90 minutes for Zimbabwe so hes a lot closer than what he was before which is great. He was really keen to go on international duty, weve had some good competition in that midfield area but a fit and ready Marvelous Nakamba is obviously a plus for us as well, so hell come back into the group.\n\nWell welcome him back and look forward to seeing him, although competition for places is fierce in the middle of the pitch. I think George (Saville) has done particularly well, Clicker (Jordan Clark) is evergreen, Zacks (Nelson) done great the last couple of games, weve got Lamine (Fanne) as well and Walshy (Liam Walsh), so competition is fierce but Marv comes back into the thinking.\n\nWith Nakamba expected back from his country later in the week, on how hungry he was to still be a part of the Hatters squad, as the former Club Brugge and Aston Villa player, who has made 57 appearances since joining the club in January 2023, last starting for Town in their 2-0 defeat to fierce rivals Watford in February, injury restricting him to just one other sub appearance at Derby County in the run-in after that, Bloomfield added: Marv has had some interest, as a number of our players have had.\n\nTheres so many different situations that weve spoken about a number of times, but hes still with us now, so hes our player and hell be ready to contribute. Hes got to get back safely from international duty and we welcome him back into training on Friday and hell be ready to compete. Hes had, weve spoken about before, a bit of a slow summer, working his way back and its great for us and for him that hes gone and played 90 minutes for Zimbabwe. He was obviously really keen to play for his country as he always is, so another proud moment for him and good for us to have him back to fitness.\n\n",
