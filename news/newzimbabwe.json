            "content": "BBC\n\nLast summer, a woman was arrested at Gatwick Airport after she arrived from Nigeria with a very young baby girl.\n\nThe woman had been living in West Yorkshire with her husband and children, and before leaving the UK for Africa had told her GP she was pregnant.\n\nThat was not true.\n\nWhen the woman returned about a month later with the baby, she was arrested on suspicion of trafficking.\n\nThe case, the second the BBC has followed through the Family Court in recent months, reveals what experts say is a worrying trend of babies possibly being brought to the UK unlawfully  some from so-called baby factories in Nigeria.\n\nThe woman, who we are calling Susan, is Nigerian, but had been living in England since June 2023, with her husband and children.\n\nA careworker with leave to remain in Britain, Susan claimed she was pregnant. But scans and blood tests showed that wasnt true. Instead, they revealed Susan had a tumour, which doctors feared could be cancerous. But she refused treatment.\n\nSusan insisted her previous pregnancies had been invisible on scans, telling her employer, my babies are always hidden. She also claimed shed been pregnant for up to 30 months with her other children.\n\nSusan had travelled to Nigeria in early June 2024, saying she wanted to have her baby there, and then contacted her local hospital in Britain, to say she had given birth.\n\nDoctors were concerned and contacted childrens services.\n\nArriving back in the UK with the baby girl  who were calling Eleanor  Susan was stopped and arrested by Sussex Police.\n\nShe was bailed and the lead police force on this confirmed there is no active investigation at the moment.\n\nAfter her arrest, Susan, her husband, and Eleanor were given DNA tests. Eleanor was taken to foster carers.\n\nWhen the results show that I am Eleanors mother, I want her to be returned immediately, Susan said.\n\nBut the tests showed the baby had no genetic link with Susan or her husband. Susan demanded a second test  which gave the same result, and then she changed her story.\n\nShed had IVF treatment before moving to Britain in 2023 with a donor egg and sperm, she said, and thats why the DNA tests were negative.\n\nSusan provided a letter from a Nigerian hospital, signed by the medical director, saying shed given birth there, as well as a document from another clinic about the IVF treatment to back up her claims.\n\nShe also provided photos and videos which she said showed her in the Nigerian hospitals labour suite. No face is visible in the images and one showed a naked woman with a placenta between her legs, with an umbilical cord still attached to it.\n\nThe Family Court in Leeds sent Henrietta Coker to investigate.\n\nMs Coker, who provides expert reports to family courts in cases like this, has nearly 30 years experience as a social worker. She trained in Britain, and worked in front-line child protection in London, before moving to Africa.\n\nMs Coker visited the medical centre where Susan claimed shed had IVF. There was no record of Susan having had treatment there  staff told her the letter was forged.\n\nShe then visited the place Susan said shed given birth. It was a shabby, three bedroom flat, with stained walls and dirty carpets.\n\nThere Ms Coker was met by three young teenage girls sitting in the reception room with nurses uniforms on.\n\nShe asked to speak to the matron and was ushered into the kitchen where a teenage girl was eating rice.\n\nMs Coker then tracked down the doctor whod written a letter saying Susan had given birth there. He said, Yes, someone had given birth.\n\nMs Coker showed him a photograph of Susan, but it wasnt her, the doctor said.\n\nImpersonating people is common in this part of the world, he told Ms Coker, suggesting that Susan might have bought the baby.\n\nSupplied Henrietta Coker has decades of experience as a social worker\n\nThe practice of baby farming is well known in West Africa, Ms Coker later told the court. At least 200 illegal baby factories have been shut down by the Nigerian authorities in the last five years, she said.\n\nSome contained young girls whod been kidnapped, raped, and forced to give birth repeatedly.\n\nSometimes these girls are released, Ms Coker said, other times they die during childbirth, or are murdered and placed in the grounds of the organisation.\n\nIts not clear where baby Eleanor might have come from  though the doctor told Ms Coker he believed she would have been given up voluntarily.\n\nMs Coker was unable to establish who Eleanors real parents are.\n\nShe gave evidence to the Family Court in Leeds in March this year, along with Susan, her husband, her employer and a senior obstetrician.\n\nAt an earlier hearing the judge asked for Susans phone to be examined. Investigators found messages which Susan had sent to someone saved in her address book as Mum oft [sic] Lagos Baby.\n\nAbout four weeks before the alleged date of birth Susan wrote a text message which read:\n\nGood afternoon ma, I have not seen the hospital items\n\nThe same day, Mum Oft Lagos Babyresponded:\n\nDelivery drug is 3.4 m\n\nHospital bill 170k.\n\nAssuming those sums to be Nigerian Naira, they would be in the region of 1,700 and 85 respectively, the Family Court judge, Recorder William Tyler KC said.\n\nThe local authority pointed out the messages were set to automatic self-destruct mode  and said they represented evidence of a deal to purchase a baby.\n\nSusan tried to explain the messages in court. The Recorder said her attempts were difficult to follow and impossible to accept.\n\nRecorder Tyler, sitting as a Deputy Judge of the High Court, found Susan had staged a scene which she falsely claimed showed her giving birth to Eleanor in Nigeria.\n\nHe said Susan and her husband had put forward a fundamental lie to explain how Eleanor came to be in their care, and had tried to mislead authorities with false documents.\n\nTheyd both caused the little girl significant emotional and psychological harm, he said.\n\nIn early July, the BBC attended the final hearing in Eleanors case, held remotely.\n\nIn one little square of the Teams meeting we could see Susan and her husband, sitting upright, barely moving, focused closely on what the advocates said.\n\nThey wanted Eleanor returned to them. Their barristers said their own children were thriving  they wanted to offer her the same love and care.\n\nSusans husband saw Eleanor as a fundamental part of their family unit.\n\nVikki Horspool, representing the childs guardian, a social worker from the Independent Children and Family Child Advisory Service challenged that. She said that the couple continued to be dishonest about Eleanors real start in life and how she came to be in their care.\n\nThe judge ordered that baby Eleanor be placed for adoption, and also made a declaration of non parentage. He said he was aware of the pain this would cause Susan and her husband.\n\nThe barrister for the local authority told the court that the baby is very settled with her foster carer, taking part in activities in her community and getting medical treatment.\n\nWhen Eleanor is adopted she will have a new identity and British nationality  but she may never know who her real parents are.\n\nEleanors storyechoes the case of Lucy who was brought into Manchester Airport in 2023, by a man claiming to be her father.\n\nMs Coker believes it is likely that more children have been brought unlawfully to the UK from West Africa. She told the BBC she has worked on around a dozen similar cases since the pandemic. In her experience, baby trafficking is commonplace.\n\nMoney is getting exchanged for children on a large scale she said  not just in Africa but across the global south.\n\nSince 2021 the UK government has restricted adoptions from Nigeria, partly because of evidence of organised child trafficking within the country.\n\nBritish authorities have been aware of the problem for many years, and there have been several cases in the Family Courts over the last 20 years.\n\nTwo hearings in 2011 and 2012 involvedNigerian couples whod had fertility treatment  that led to a miracle baby.\n\nThese treatments continue, as recently exposed byinvestigative journalists at BBC Africa Eye.\n\nIn 2013, the UK High Commission in Lagos required DNA tests in certain circumstances before newborn babies could be taken from Nigeria to Britain.\n\nAmong 12 couples investigated was a former Oxford academic,prosecuted for immigration offences.\n\nHoweverthis process has since stopped.In 2018 officials were advised that such DNA testing was unlawful.\n\nThey were told they could not make people undergo DNA testing when they were asking for a visa or passport in support of an application relating to immigration status  and that had been the case since 2014.\n\nMs Coker said some clinics offer packages that include registering the babys birth. It will cost anywhere between 2,000 and 8,000, excluding any airfare, she said.\n\nShe thinks more people in Britain should be aware of this activity.\n\nIt is hard to tackle, she said  perhaps DNA testing of newborn babies and purported parents would help.\n\nBut she wasnt sure the British government can do much to stop it, she said, the issues start in countries where the children are born.\n\nPatricia Durr, CEO of the anti-trafficking charity ECPAT said cases like this were particularly heinous because they denied a child right to their identity.\n\nShe said: Every effort must be made to prevent these egregious crimes occurring.\n\nA government spokesperson said: Falsely claiming to be the parent of a child to facilitate entry to the UK is illegal. Those found doing so will face the full force of the law.\n\nBorder Force is committed to protecting individuals who cross the border and where concerns are raised, officers will take action to safeguard individuals who could be at risk.\n\nThe BBC contacted the Nigerian High Commission for comment but they did not respond.\n\n",

This enhances security for the passenger at all times. It also enables us to know who the passenger is, where they are going, and any other necessary information. This helps safeguard both the passenger and the driver. There had been rising cases of robberies in taxis.\n\nThe security features reduce the risk of robberies for both the driver and the passenger. We can trace whenever a car goes off route, and we work with relevant security services, including the police, whenever safety is compromised, said Chinembiri.\n\nHe added that thorough security checks for drivers have been praised by clients.\n\nWe have been receiving feedback on our security system. If you give the driver a parcel, there is an one-time password OTP that one receives, making it easier to track the goods. We conduct thorough verification when someone joins our platform, which makes tracking easier, he explained.\n\nThe ride-hailing platform also keeps costs low, offering affordable services to its customer base. It allows both drivers and passengers to negotiate fares, giving them control over ride terms.\n\nChinembiri said the application is synonymous with lower transport costs for passengers, and drivers benefit from commission.\n\nGone are the days when people were charged based solely on their destination. With Click A Ride, you can charge a passenger per kilometre, which is cheaper. Passengers can also select their own prices. We also have lower commissions and conduct driver training sessions to reduce service conflicts, he said.\n\nClick A Ride offers taxi services, premium vehicle hire, parcel delivery via motorcycles, three-wheelers, trucks, and emergency towing services, making it the first platform in Zimbabwe to provide such a wide range of options.\n\nAdditionally, clients can choose from different service tiers, bronze, silver, gold, and platinum, with the latter offering top-notch services.\n\nClick A Ride enables users to access emergency taxis. If you have a business and sell goods online, our bikes help with deliveries. We also have scooters at the same prices as bikes and assist in moving heavy goods.\n\nOur application will soon be updated to include goods-in-transit insurance, which will be visible and help with compensation in case of accidents, Chinembiri added.\n\nCurrently, Click A Ride is running a weekly competition where top clients stand to win US$100 or even a motor vehicle.\n\n",
