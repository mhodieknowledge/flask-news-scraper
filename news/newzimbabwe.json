            "content": "By Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nThis story was originally published byGlobal Press Journal.\n\nHARARE, ZIMBABWE  The cholera outbreak that swept through Zimbabwe in 2008-2009 killed more than 4,000 people and sickened nearly 100,000. Parts of Harare and its surrounding suburbs were especially hard hit, and in the aftermath, attention fell on the unreliability of the capital citys aging infrastructure. The government ultimately secured a US$144 million loan from China Exim Bank to overhaul the citys water treatment network.\n\nThe promised upgrades never came, but now, the city wants ratepayers to foot the bill with a water levy introduced in March.\n\nThe loaned funds were supposed to upgrade water treatment plants, and pump stations, and roll out prepaid meters for 500,000 households.\n\nNow, almost two decades later, citizens are being asked to repay a loan they say brought them no benefit.\n\nIf the water situation had improved, maybe it would make sense, says Prudence Hanyani, who was born and raised in Mabvuku, a suburb of the capital city that falls in its service area. We never saw infrastructure development or better services. So what exactly are we paying for?\n\nHarares daily water production has steadily declined over the years due to a mix of deferred maintenance, contamination, and leaky pipes and valves in the distribution network, according to a 2015 World Bank report. In 2005, the city produced approximately 600 megaliters each day  thats 600 million liters, or 158.5 million gallons, enough to fill 240 Olympic-size swimming pools. By 2008, daily output dropped to around 400 megaliters, then fluctuated between 400 and 600 megaliters over the next few years. However, by February this year, the supply had fallen further to just 350 megaliters per day.\n\nHarare needs more than three times that amount, some 1,200 megaliters per day (317 million gallons), to meet the needs of residents and businesses, says Hardlife Mudzingwa, director of the advocacy group Community Water Alliance.\n\nWhat was a government responsibility is now being offloaded onto ordinary households already grappling with economic hardship, says Mudzingwa, who has petitioned the government to account for how the money was used.\n\nTaps in Mabvuku ran dry around the year 2000, Hanyani says, and residents havent had running water since. With six children to care for, she now spends up to US$3 a day to buy water for drinking, cooking, cleaning and sanitation, an added burden in a country where the average monthly household income fell to just US$88 in 2024. Now an additional water levy of US$1 is expected from her each month.\n\nPrudence Hanyani collects water from a disused chicken brooder where she stores her household supply. Hanyani, who has lived without running water for over two decades, now faces a new government-imposed water levy tied to a failed Chinese loan project that promised but never delivered improved infrastructure. Credit: Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nZimbabwes infrastructure funding gap is huge.\n\nThe country needs an estimated US$2 billion annually until 2032, of which the government can only fund about 20%. Key projects, such as the Harare water and sewer upgrade and major dam developments, have been financed through loans, particularly from China Exim Bank. But many of these projects, including the Harare upgrade, stalled after loan disbursements were suspended due to contract breaches.\n\nZimbabwe turned to China for loans in the early 2000s primarily due to limited access to more established financing sources, following years of economic sanctions, political isolation and a deteriorating credit rating. China emerged as a willing lender, offering infrastructure loans and investments under its Belt and Road initiative and Zimbabwes Look East policy. However, the country has faced challenges in repaying these loans, leading to significant arrears.\n\nIn 2018, China Exim Bank provided a US$153 million government concessional loan for the expansion of the Robert Gabriel Mugabe International Airport. While the project aimed to increase the airports capacity from 2.5 million to 6 million passengers annually, it was hampered by delays and financial mismanagement. By the end of 2021, Zimbabwe had accumulated $3 million in arrears on the loan.\n\nSimilarly, the Victoria Falls Airport Renovation and Expansion Project relied on a US$149.9 million loan, issued in 2012. The project was completed in 2016, but Zimbabwes arrears still ballooned to US$54 million by the end of 2021.\n\nThe Chinese water and sewer loan came at a time when various partners were funding infrastructure upgrades in the sector, Mudzingwa says. Following the 2008 cholera outbreak, international development partners including the United Nations Childrens Fund, the African Development Bank and the World Bank stepped in with additional support. In Harare, much of that funding was frittered away as the city failed to consult with residents in project planning or install systems to track revenue, manage budgets and detect fraud and waste. As a result, there has never been clarity on how exactly the money was used, even as millions of Zimbabweans have been left without access to safe, reliable water.\n\nThe China Exim Bank water loan had an 11-year repayment term with a four-year grace period and variable interest set at roughly 3.5%.\n\nAlthough the project officially began in 2013, progress quickly stalled when Zimbabwes failure to repay an earlier loan prompted the bank to freeze disbursements. The earlier loan was for planned renovations to the dormant state-owned steel enterprise Ziscosteel, which were never completed. Harare City Council spent US$8 million from the water treatment loan on 25 luxury vehicles. The council claimed the cars were necessary for service delivery, but the lender disagreed. By 2017, only half the loan had been released, and disbursements remained frozen through 2020.\n\nAs of 2021, the Harare water project alone accounted for nearly US$67 million in unpaid debt. Across its portfolio, Zimbabwe owed China Exim Bank more than US$260 million in arrears spanning numerous sectors, from telecommunications to airports to defense.\n\nWe are the ones drinking water, says Harare Mayor Jacob Mafume. Surely if Harare residents are drinking the water, they should pay for it themselves instead of asking the tax dollar of some Chipinge resident busy chasing a big frog.\n\nWard 16 councillor Denford Ngadziore is calling for an audit. If there are people who misused the money, they should be prosecuted. I presented this solution in the full council meeting, but other councilors disagreed with me, he says. We cannot make residents pay the loan without a clear report on how the loan was used.\n\nViolet Razau carries a bucket of water to her home in Mabvuku. Like many residents in this suburb of Harare, she has relied on makeshift sources for years. Despite having received no benefit from a long-stalled water project funded by a Chinese loan, residents are now expected to repay it through monthly levies. Credit: Linda Mujuru, GPJ Zimbabwe\n\nMafume insists that everything was done above board, arguing that the Land Rover Defenders and Amarok pickup trucks purchased for the project were not, in fact, luxury vehicles and that the utility has been hampered by its inability to purchasewater treatment chemicals, which cost some US$3 million a month, according to the mayors office. By and large, the equipment that was bought is there for anyone to go and see. And the good thing is that the new pumps and the old pumps, you can see the difference in performance, he says. Look at the old pumps, they look like they can explode at any time. So the work that the Chinese did on the plant speaks for itself.\n\nMudzingwa argues that the loan acquisition process itself was flawed because a section of Zimbabwes 2013 Constitution says that any international treaty signed or carried out by the president or on the presidents behalf is not legally binding unless it is first approved by Parliament.\n\nHe says the provision reinforces the principle of legislative oversight in the treaty-making process. The agreement was ratified by council in December 2013, but by then, the money had already been spent. Ratification should have come first, he says.\n\nMudzingwa also disputes the mayors contention that promised equipment upgrades were made. Theres no visible infrastructure to justify the cost. Now, residents are being asked to pay for a loan they didnt benefit from. Thats unfair, he says.\n\nMudzingwa worries the levy sets a precedent for ordinary citizens to foot the bill for loan projects characterized by improper procedure, opaque spending and unaccountable leadership.\n\nZimbabwes experience mirrors similar challenges seen in other countries reliant on Chinese infrastructure financing. Zambia canceled US$1.6 billion in undisbursed Chinese loans in 2022 amid a mounting debt crisis, while Sri Lanka was forced to award a Chinese company a 99-year lease on a newly-built port after defaulting on construction loans China had provided.\n\nBack in Mabvuku, the water struggle remains deeply personal.\n\nViolet Razau, a hairdresser and mother of two, has lived in the area since 1998. As a child, I watered our garden with a hose. My 13-year-old son has never seen that. Now, I dont even get a drop from council taps, so why should I pay?\n\nFor Hanyanis 70-year-old mother, Precious Mudimu, age has made the crisis harder. I cant carry water buckets. I rely on others, but theyre not always around. Im old, I cant work to pay levies, she says. This place feels like a desert.\n\nLinda Mujuruis a Reporter-in-Residence based in Harare, Zimbabwe.

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nLocal grainmilling companies have raised concerns over the invasion of stipulated reserved sectors by foreign nationals.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of an engagement with the Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe(GMAZ), small millers from Bulawayo said the milling sector reserved for locals under the law is now being invaded by foreigners, particularly Pakistanis.\n\nOne local miller, James Kamono, who owns Marula Milling Company, said the foreigners were trading mealie meals at questionable prices.\n\nThe Indigenisation and Economic Empowerment Act in Zimbabwe reserves certain sectors, including grain milling, for ownership by Zimbabwean citizens. This means that, in principle, only businesses owned by locals are permitted to operate in these sectors.\n\nOne of the challenges we are having as small millers is the invasion of this reserved sector by foreign nationals, Kamono said.\n\nThese foreign nationals, particularly the Pakistanis, are selling mealie meals at low and questionable prices. This has lowered our production and sales, he lamented.\n\nKamono called on the government to put stiffer policies and penalties to safeguard the reserved sector for locals.\n\nWe spoke about indigenisation and the reserved sector, but I think we need to push more on that issue of indigenisation and the reserved sector because we have so many foreigners opening their milling companies and that is affecting our operations, he added.\n\nAnother Southern Region milling company owner, Mthandazo Moyoof Shakata Investments, said the invasion of the sector by the Pakistanis was worsening the burden of the already struggling milling businesses.\n\nThe big problem that we are facing is financial muscle. As a small miller we do not have the capital to buy many tonnes of maize and the situation is worsened by foreigners who are taking over the sectors reserved for locals, said Moyo.\n\nMeanwhile, milling companies welcomed the efforts by Grain Millers Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ), which is set to facilitate the movement of maize from the Northern to the Southern Region of the country as part of government efforts to ensure food security.\n\nSpeaking on the sidelines of a meeting, GMAZ Southern Region Vice Chair, Mthokozisi Sibanda said movement of maize will permit farmers to access more markets while allowing small millers to access raw materials at a better cost.\n\nWe want to appreciate the Government in ensuring there is food security in the Southern Region. As we speak right now most millers are seized with buying local maize as you know for the past few years we have been importing from abroad and currently we have been asked by the Government to assist our local farmers in selling and exploring the local market, Sibanda said.\n\nHe added that localtrade will allow a quick turnover in the movement of maize.\n\nMost millers are seized with that opportunity and we want to appreciate that because that comes in handy.\n\nLocal purchases of grain are key over the turnover of the movement of maize we want to bring it from the northern Region into the Southern Region which might take a day or so which is an advantage and is key to our milling plants as we bring that necessary raw material, said the GMAZ vice Chairperson.\n\nAccording to Sibanda, the movement of maize from the Northern Region will allow the country to fully utilize the local milling capacity.\n\nNot only that, the export of labour has stopped, particularly over our milling plants. We are now buying locally, promoting the local farmers and improving our capacity utilisation of our milling plants.\n\nThis is key in our industrial development, national development, as well as our GDP.\n\n",

Collaborating with Nvidia gives us the advanced computing capabilities needed to drive Africas AI innovation while strengthening the continents digital independence, Masiyiwa stated in a press release.\n\nNvidia will reportedly implement thousands of GPUs, which power its high-performance supercomputers, and intertwine its AI software using NVIDIA Cloud Partner reference architectures.\n\nCassava president Hardy Pemhiwa revealed that 3,000 Nvidia GPUs would be embedded into their South African facility in June before installing 9,000 more across Kenya, Nigeria, Morocco, and Egypt over the next three to four years. Masiyiwa,Bloombergreports, is prepared to invest up to $720 million in the project.\n\nThe future comes from young people building apps and solutions, small businesses every day across this continent using AI, Masiyiwa said at the Global AI Summit on Africa 2025 in Kigali in April where he was a co-chair. They are the digital natives, and we just have given them the ability to do what they do best.\n\nAfrica has the unprecedented opportunity of becoming a global tech leader, boasting ample resources, worldwide investment, and the biggest (and youngest) untapped market in the world.\n\nAround 600 million Africans still lack reliable access to electricity, a figure that experts believe will subside thanks to the continents push for renewable energy and growing access to mobile internet services, such as Starlink.\n\nFintechs and AI startups are abundant from Nairobi to Accra, but the continents limited tech infrastructure and low digital literacy rates continue to squeeze its known potential of leading the AI revolution.\n\nThe Future of Jobs Report 2025by the World Economic Forum identified a critical skills gap in Africa, with over 60% of companies believing it to be one of the most significant barriers to business transfer formation by 2030.\n\nNew, cutting-edge technology now beckons for the continent; Nvidia-powered AI factories are set to seemingly streamline AI development through an optimized ecosystem supporting algorithm development, model experimentation, and data pipelines.\n\nAkin to a startup incubator, but on a mass, online scale, the proposed AI factory is designed to foster innovation and accelerate African AI development by connecting local businesses, governments, and researchers to high-performance AI infrastructure while alleviating them from the financial burdensome Nvidia-built GPUs cost thousands of dollarsof investing in hardware.\n\nBuilding digital infrastructure for the AI economy is a priority if Africa is to take full advantage of the fourth industrial revolution, added Masiyiwa in the press statement.\n\nOur AI Factory provides the infrastructure for this innovation to scale, empowering African businesses, startups, and researchers with access to cutting-edge AI infrastructure to turn their bold ideas into real-world breakthroughsand now, they dont have to look beyond Africa to get it.\n\n",
