            "content": "By Farai Mutsaka, UNICEF\n\nMUTOKO, Zimbabwe  Its a Friday, and classes end at midday. But unlike before, Miriam Kaseke, a teacher at Domborinenhiwi Primary School, is in no rush to find transport home. Instead, she looks forward to hosting family members for the weekend at the school, nestled deep in the rural eastern fringe of Mashonaland East province.\n\nThey are comfortable coming here these days. It feels like home, she said, as she made her way to a new grey house on the school grounds, built with support from the Schools Improvement Grant (SIG), Complementary Funding for teacher accommodation.\n\nThis warmth and comfort sharply contrast with Kasekes arrival at the school in 2019. Back then, the single, dilapidated four-roomed teachers house was already overcrowded, leaving her with no option but to occupy the pantry.\n\nA space originally meant as an indoor toilet was already taken. That tiny pantry became my kitchen, my bedroom, and my living room all in one, she recalled. I couldnt even turn around properly when sleeping. If I tried to roll over, my head would end up in a dish of water and my feet on the plates, she added, painfully remembering how desperate she felt during her first days.\n\nThere was no privacy, and inviting my spouse to visit was out of the question. I wondered to myself, Of all my college classmates, am I the cursed one? she said.\n\nThe houses doors didnt lock properly, and the windows barely stayed in their frames. Reptiles would freely slip through its leaky roof. She laughs nervously as she recalls one teacher fleeing his room in terror after a snake slithered under his blankets.\n\nIt was impossible to get a restful nights sleep. I constantly struggled just to feel safe. I wanted to go home, but being on a year-long probation, I couldnt transfer immediately, she said.\n\nThe poor conditions extended beyond the accommodation to the teaching environment itself.\n\nIt was a disaster, from the teachers lodging to the classrooms. I felt drained every morning walking into school, knowing I would return that evening to a place I was forced to call home, Kaseke said.\n\nOne classroom block was a mud structure, another had lost its roof to the wind, offering little protection for teachers and pupils alike. Without windows or doors, livestock roamed freely inside, destroying books and learning materials. Teachers had to deal with composite classes, turning both learning and teaching into a nightmare.\n\nTeachers would frequently be absent or rarely stay long, forcing the school to rely on untrained community volunteers, mostly recent school leavers, said Melody Mupfudze, the acting school head.\n\nThis challenge reflects a wider regional problem. According to a 2020 UNICEF study titled Time to Teach: Teacher Attendance and Time on Task in Eastern and Southern Africa, teacher absenteeismranging from 15 to 45 per cent in the regionis a major contributor to a learning crisis. In low- and middle-income rural schools, over half of the children finish primary school unable to read or understand simple texts. The report highlights that poor working conditions often drive teacher absence, while stronger parental and community engagement improves attendance and classroom presence.\n\nAt Domborinenhiwi Primary School, the SIG intervention is beginning to address this issue.\n\nWe are working to grow our teaching staff. In 2019, we had seven teachers; now only four remain, although we are getting another one this coming term. We will still need four more. But I am confident the current teachers will stay because the situation on classrooms and teachers accommodation has significantly improved in recent years, said Mupfudze, who recalled marking books while sitting on a water bucket when she first arrived in 2012.\n\nShe praised the SIG Complementary Funding for transforming the schools fortunes. The school has roofed and floored its run-down classroom block, purchased desks, and, with continuing support, constructed a brand-new block specifically for infant pupils.\n\nThat new block is the most beautiful of all. We did everything from foundation to roofing with SIG funds; we had enough resources, said Mupfudze, pointing proudly to a bright yellow classroom building.\n\nUNICEFZimbabwe/2025/Farai Mutsaka.Improved housing and classroom blocks are inspiring teachers at Domborinenhiwi Primary School.\n\nInspired by the ongoing changes, Kaseke opted to stay and become a key part of the schools development effort.\n\nI thought to myself, I can be part of this big picture. I need to get involved. Since then, I have been part of the team working to make this a school other communities will look to for inspiration, she said.\n\nThe experience has also enriched Kaseke with practical knowledge about school building and management. A newcomer in 2019, she quickly became deeply involved in the schools transformation under the SIG intervention, becoming familiar with the whole school approach promoted by the Ministry of Primary and Secondary Education and UNICEF.\n\nThis approach centres on making communities active partners in school development to foster learning environments that are child-friendly, widely supported, and sustainable.\n\nThe SIG funds gave us a huge boost, but we couldnt have succeeded without community help. We engaged parents, political leaders, and traditional authorities; everyone became part of the team, Kaseke reflected.\n\nThe whole school approach emphasises that successful school transformation requires a participatory, shared ownership model. It involves parents, caregivers, traditional and political leaders, religious influencers, and even the children themselves as key stakeholders in development.\n\nOn a recent day, several men used wheelbarrows and shovels to transport sand, which is essential for construction work.\n\nLets make sure everyone is here, we cant afford to start the rainy season with this block unfinished, said School Development Committee chairperson Knowledge Meki to volunteers gathered to contribute unpaid labour.\n\nWe have completed the other blocks and teachers accommodation, but we still have one block left to finish, he added.\n\nUNICEFZimbabwe/2025/Farai MutsakaA community effort, combined with UNICEF-supported funding, breathes new life into struggling schools in Zimbabwe.\n\nLocal councillor Christopher Machipisa was among those lending a hand. He understands the critical role education plays in an area where artisanal gold mining lures childrenboth boys and girlsinto hazardous mining activities for quick cash.\n\nThe problems at school reflect what happens at home. Children come to school but find no teachers. At home, they see young boys flaunting money from gold mining over education. The girls often marry the miners. But these are short-term gains; the real long-term achievements come from good education, said Machipisa. Thats the challenge we want to overcome, and why creating good conditions for teachers to stay is so important.\n\nKaseke, standing alongside other teachers, smiled as she looked on.\n\nWere not going anywhere as long as you keep this dedication, she said with a laugh.\n\n",

The results announced on September 22 are from the first two completed diamond drill holes.\n\nOne of the holes, drilled to 250 metres, returned notable assays including 5.10g/t over 2.18m from 28.00m depth, 13.66g/t over 2.75m from 134.00m, and 7.87g/t over 2.60m from 209.80m.\n\nThe second hole, also drilled to 250 metres, intersected 3.49g/t over 5.69m from 28.90m, 9.31g/t over 1.00m from 85.55m, and the headline 8.09g/t over 8.05m from 158.62m.\n\nSurface diamond drilling at Bills Luck continues to exceed our expectations. Weve now confirmed that the main Bills Luck ore body extends to at least 160m vertical depth, with multiple high-grade intersections throughout the latest exploration holes. We are particularly encouraged by the 8.05m intersection at 158.62m carrying 8.09g/t gold, said Kavango CEO Ben Turney.\n\nHe added that the company is preparing to advance mining operations by extending shaft sinking from the current three-level to a four-level operation.\n\n",

Group insurance contract revenue rose 19% to US$87.7 million, reflecting growing preference for USD-based products.\n\nFMHL also posted fair value gains of US$1 million on investment property, compared with a US$50 million loss in 2024. Net investment returns rose nearly 200% to US$0.5 million, while rental income held steady at US$4.3 million.\n\nThe recovery comes amid tight monetary policy, with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe maintaining its policy rate at 35% and high statutory reserve requirements to support the Zimbabwe Gold (ZWG) currency. The measures have provided some stability, though the informal sector continues to dominate, accounting for 76% of output.\n\nPerformance across business units was mixed. First Mutual Health grew revenue 30% to US$36.3 million but posted a US$0.7 million loss due to high claims and weak equity markets. Group Life Assurance revenue increased 26% to US$7.5 million, while profit slipped 11% to US$0.2 million.\n\nNicoz Diamond Insurance reported a 7% decline in revenue to US$18.4 million but achieved a 30% rise in profit to US$0.9 million, supported by favorable claims ratios and cost controls.

They have brought the administration of justice into disrepute.\n\nThe dispute centres on Subdivision B of Springs Farm in Harare, a 671-hectare property allocated to Marimba Properties in 2024 as compensation for land lost to settlers in Aspindale Park.\n\nDespite multiple directives from the Environmental Management Agency (EMA), the Ministry of Mines, and the Ministry of Lands to cease operations, Beable Investments continued its activities.\n\nMandaza said photographic and drone evidence provided by a licensed expert showed thriving brick moulding and clay extraction in direct violation of the provisional court order issued in July 2025.\n\nIt does not make sense for the respondents to claim that they are not in contempt when the evidence points to a thriving activity on the farm, the judge noted. It is clearly a lie that there is no activity going on at the farm.\n\nThe judge also dismissed the respondents claims of harassment and their objections to the admissibility of photographic evidence, stressing that directors cannot hide behind their companies to evade accountability.\n\nA director who, with knowledge of a court order against a company, causes that company to disobey it, is himself guilty of contempt of court, Mandaza ruled.\n\nThe background to the case reveals a protracted land wrangle. In April 2024, President Emmerson Mnangagwa directed that Marimba Residential Properties be compensated with Springs Farm and Stuhm land after it lost Aspindale Park.\n\nGovernment officials, including Lands Minister Anxious Masuka and Local Government Minister Daniel Garwe, confirmed the transfer.\n\nIn October 2024, the Mines Ministry revoked Beable Investments mining certificate, but the company refused to vacate the land.\n\nJustice Mandaza said the conduct of the company and its director showed a knack for defying authority, adding that their continued operations undermined the rule of law.\n\nAll orders of court, whether correctly or incorrectly granted, have to be obeyed until they are properly set aside, he warned.\n\nThe ruling compels Beable Investments and its director to immediately stop operations, or risk execution of property and imprisonment.\n\n",
