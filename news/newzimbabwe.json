            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nZANU PF Womens League national chairperson, Mabel Chinomona has fired salvos, declaring that President Emmerson Mnangagwa is going nowhere despite growing calls for his resignation before expiry of his term.\n\nWar veterans, including some affiliated to the ruling Zanu PF party, have been vociferous urging the 82-year-old Zanu PF leader to step aside for presiding over a ruinous economy while corruption festers under his watch.\n\nThe calls follow attempts by Mnangagwas henchmen to push the 2030 agenda aimed at perpetuating his stay in office beyond his second and final term that expires in 2028. Another faction opposed to the move is positioning Vice President Constantino Chiwenga to take over from the ageing Zanu PF stalwart.\n\nAddressing the national executive of the critical organ of the party in Harare Friday, Chinomona lamented the unrelenting attacks on the person of the President, saying the trend was unprecedented.\n\nShe asserted that social media activists agitating for a change of guard at State House should desist from attacking Mnangagwa, arguing he has ushered in transformative developmental projects since inception of the Second Republic.\n\nPeople are busy giving each other positions on social media, that this is your year, so-and-so will assume leadership. There is no sun that rises before another one sets dont bother us with your nuisances, Chinomona said to wild applause from attendees.\n\nIt is common knowledge that from Mnangagwa, there will come other leaders, it is everywhere, this one comes and goes\n\nbut do we get positions by insulting others? Which country does that? Let us not let this country go down under our watch as women. How does it go down under our watch?\n\nHave you ever lived in a country in which its President is insulted? Have you ever lived in such a country?\n\nChinomona, who doubles as Senate President, is a Mnangagwa loyalist whose utterances were predictable given that she owes her current plum posts to the octogenarian leader.\n\nShe cajoled Mnangagwa, whom she described as too good to reign in dissenting voices.\n\nWe want to appeal to our President that you have let us down (by not punishing detractors). You have been too good, she added.\n\nThe Zanu PF Womens League boss accused some unprincipled party elements of accepting bribes as little as US$10 to denigrate party leadership inspite of them having rolled out myriad empowerment programmes, including, among others, chicken rearing projects.\n\nDuring Fridays event, Chinomona paraded state-of-the-art egg incubators, which will be distributed to all the countrys 10 provinces to boost poultry projects by women.\n\n",

Moving back to 2024, I will start by Harare Province where we have maternal deaths of 19 and neonatal deaths of 111.\n\nThe leading cause of death was hypertensive disorders and its complications, including renal failure. The other was post-partum hemorrhage post having an abortion, post normal delivery and also post caesarian section. Sexes was also a contributory factor. Some had underlying HIV and Diabetic Mellitus conditions. Other causes were a dilated cardiomyopathy, said Kwidini.\n\nThe deputy minister added that neonatal deaths were mainly caused by respiratory complications.\n\nOn neonatal deaths of 299, the leading cause was respiratory distress as a complication. Secondary was birth asplenium due to challenges with intercultural chair, he said.\n\nZimbabwes healthcare system has come under intense scrutiny, with the government accused of neglecting the critical sector.\n\nCritics have slammed the government for failing to allocate sufficient funding to hospitals and rural health institutions while embarking on profligacy buying luxury top-of-the-range vehicles for bureaucrats, among other hefty perks.\n\nThe situation has been exacerbated by the departure of healthcare workers to European countries due to poor remuneration.\n\nKwidini acknowledged that rural communities are disproportionately affected by the lack of adequate health services.\n\nIt is very true that we are having challenges in rural areas, especially when one changes skills and also the road networks where our people should access medical attention quickly, especially the pregnant women.\n\nHowever, what we have done as the ministry now is, we are retraining because we know our trained midwives have migrated to what is called greener pastures, which gives us a burden as a ministry. So, we have reintroduced a massive retraining of midwives so that we can cater for those people in rural areas.\n\nWe are also upgrading what we call primary care nurses in rural areas to be able to be midwives so that they can also render the services like the ones which were being given by those departed midwives.\n\nWe have gone far further to deploy what we call mobile small scanning machines so that our pregnant women can undergo scanning, which is recommended at the initial stage where the pregnant woman is going to book for antenatal care so that we reduce those complications, especially on maternal and neonatal deaths, Kwidini said.\n\n",

The government and M23 accused each other of perpetrating the blasts.\n\nM23 claims control over several territories in eastern DRC, including Bukavu and Goma, the provincial capitals of South Kivu and North Kivu. On Friday, M23 appointed a governor of South Kivu, after establishing a parallel administration in North Kivu in mid-February.\n\nThe ongoing conflict between M23 and the DRC government is deeply rooted in the aftermath of the 1994 Rwandan genocide and longstanding ethnic tensions.\n\nThe DRC accuses Rwanda of supporting M23, while Rwanda claims that the DRC army has allied with the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, a rebel group accused of participating in the genocide against Tutsis.\n\nThe conflict has led to massive population displacements and a worsening humanitarian crisis. Tensions remain high despite diplomatic and military efforts to end the hostilities.\n\nA meeting of foreign ministers from the Southern African Development Community (SADC) and the East African Community (EAC), initially scheduled for Friday in Harare, Zimbabwe, did not take place for unknown reasons.\n\nThe joint SADC-EAC summit in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, three weeks ago represents the latest peace mechanism to address the crisis in the Great Lakes region.\n\n",

            "content": "By AFP\n\nUS President Donald Trump cut short a meeting with Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday and said the Ukrainian leader is not ready for peace with Russia in an extraordinary meltdown in the Oval Office that threw question marks over chances for a truce.\n\nZelensky was meant to be making a full White House visit to sign a US-Ukrainian deal for joint exploitation of Ukraines mineral resources, as part of a post-war recovery in a US-brokered peace deal.\n\nInstead, an ugly clash blew up almost immediately in the Oval Office where Trump and Vice President JD Vance shouted at Zelensky, accusing him of not being thankful for US help in the three-year war against Russian invasion.\n\nTrump berated Zelensky, telling him to be more thankful and that without US assistance Ukraine would have been conquered by Russia.\n\nYoure either going to make a deal or were out, Trump added.\n\nAnd if were out, youll fight it out and I dont think its going to be pretty.\n\nZelensky left in his motorcade shortly after, without holding a planned joint press conference. The resources deal was left unsigned, the White House said.\n\nTrump took to his Truth Social platform to castigate Zelensky saying he disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office.\n\nZelensky is not ready for peace, Trump wrote.\n\nHe can come back when he is ready for peace.\n\nCompromise row\n\nThe extraordinary meltdown came after Trump said Ukraine will have to make compromises in a truce with Russia, which has occupied swaths of Ukraine, destroying entire cities and towns along the way.\n\nYou cant do any deals without compromises. So certainly, hes going to have to make some compromises, but hopefully they wont be as big as some people think, Trump said.\n\nBut showing Trump pictures of war atrocities and referring to Russian President Vladimir Putin, Zelensky said there should be no compromises with a killer on our territory.\n\nCrazy Russians, he said, deported Ukrainian children and committed war crimes during their three-year invasion of his country.\n\nThe dramatic public breakdown in the long-tense relationship between Zelensky and Trump came after their meeting  in front of a large group of journalists  had appeared to get off to a friendlier start.\n\nZelensky had said, I think President Trump is on our side.\n\nTruce talks in doubt\n\nThe clash left in doubt efforts led by Trump to cast himself as mediator in the war.\n\nThe leaders of France and Britain also came to the White House this week, seeking to persuade Trump not to take the Russian line and to bolster US support for Ukraine in a future truce.\n\nAfter the drama in the White House, Polands Prime Minister Donald Tusk told Zelensky: You are not alone.\n\nTrump has alarmed Kyiv and European allies with his abrupt U-turn in US policy, ending what had been full-throated support for Ukraines attempt to defeat the Russian invasion and casting himself as a mediator between Putin and Zelensky.\n\nTrump said in the Oval Office that he had spoken on numerous occasions to Putin  more than has been publicly reported beyond the lengthy call between the two leaders earlier this February.\n\nSpeaking before the shouting match erupted, Trump told Zelensky that a truce is fairly close.\n\nThe US leader also said that the proposed minerals deal would be very fair.\n\nThe proposal was to give Washington financial benefits for helping Ukraine in a truce, even if Trump has repeatedly refused to commit any US military force as a back-up to European troops who might act as peacekeepers.\n\nDictator without elections\n\nThe clash came after Trump has flip-flopped in his tone on Zelensky.\n\nTrump called him a dictator last week and has repeatedly blamed Ukraine for Russias February 2022 invasion and echoed a series of Kremlin talking points about how the war started.\n\nBut on Thursday, Trump said at a joint press conference with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer: I have a lot of respect for him.\n\nWere going to get along really well, he said.\n\nTrump, who has repeatedly expressed admiration for Putin, said this week he trusts Putin to keep his word on any ceasefire.\n\nSenate Democrats accused Trump and Vance of siding with Putin.\n\nThey are doing Putins dirty work. Senate Democrats will never stop fighting for freedom and democracy, Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer posted on social media.\n\nDisgraceful, said Senator Chris Van Hollen.\n\nAs tensions between Moscow and Washington escalated, Russias assault on Ukraine continued.\n\nRussian infantry were on Friday storming the Ukrainian border from the Russian region of Kursk, near areas of the region that were seized last summer by Ukrainian forces, Kyiv said Friday.\n\n",

Hes just a journalist practicing his profession, which is constitutionally protected, just like you guys are doing here, broadcasting to the public at home.\n\nYou cant be accused of inciting the public for broadcasting what Im saying right now.\n\nI am the one who should be brought before the courts, not the journalists who transmit the information. So, Im disappointed in that regard, but this is the reality that we are in right now, Ncube said.\n\nThe media entrepreneur said he was disappointed that Mhlanga was denied bail, pointing to selective application of the law and also accused the court of failing to appreciate that there should be freedom of the press.\n\nHe also accused Mnangagwa of controlling the judiciary, noting that the President literally owns the courts.\n\nI think fundamentally important is the fact that there wasnt any indication that the court realises that youre dealing with freedom of expression and press freedom, and that Blessed did not say any of the stuff that he is alleged to have said.\n\nUnfortunately, President Mnangagwa owns the courts. They have said they own the military; they own the police, they will do as they please. We will continue; I mean, Im sure the lawyers will do what is right, but what we saw happening today is not fair; It is not justice, and our Constitution does not support what has just taken place here, Ncube said.\n\nMhlanga was denied bail by Harare Magistrate Farai Gwitima, who ruled that he was likely to interfere with witnesses who are his subordinates.\n\nThe magistrate also said his release will jeopardise peace in Zimbabwe, among other reasons.\n\nHis lawyer Chris Mhike said he will be filing an appeal at the High Court as soon as possible.\n\nMhlanga will be back in court March 14 for routine remand.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nIMPOSING deals from private companies on City of Harare (CoH) without following proper procedures and consultation creates a breeding ground for corruption, residents have said.\n\nThese are the sentiments of the Combined Harare Residents Association (CHRA), who are at loggerheads with council and the Ministry of Local Government over the approval of Geo Pomona to carry out waste management in the capital.\n\nSpeaking at a recent meeting with Harare Mayor Jacob Mafume at Town House, CHRA director Reuben Akili said that the failure to consult and the passing of council resolutions on private partnerships creates channels for corruption.\n\nWhen you read the addendum for the Pomona project, it also speaks to the issues of the local authority transferring equipment and moving workers to Geo Pomona, which is likely an agreement that was not discussed.\n\nWe need to look at the root causes of this corruption. This is very important because when you look at these committees, they play an oversight role.\n\nWhen issues are discussed in a chamber like this, decisions are made at that level. But when decisions do not originate from there, we create room for corruption. We create room for the bleeding of council resources, said Akili.\n\nGeo Pomona was established in 2022 after a Dutch waste management firm, Geogenix BV, secured a US$350 million waste-to-energy deal with the city.\n\nGeo Pomonas operations with Harare have been a source of contention among residents amid new information that the firms local focal person, Delish Nguwaya, and President Emmerson Mnangagwas son, have 50-50 percent shares in the company.\n\nInitially, Town House opposed granting permission for Geo Pomona to take over its dumping sites but has since changed its stance, agreeing to work together to clear the dump sites.\n\nGeo Pomona Waste Management will collect 650 tonnes of refuse daily at a rate of US$40 per tonne.\n\nDespite objections from residents, Geo Pomonas projects have been dubbed a model to emulate in other cities by the government.\n\nMafume, once a vocal critic of Geo Pomona, told residents that private partnerships such as this one will transform the CoH.\n\nLet us be clear, there are certain things that can be done better if we work with the private sector. I do understand that initially, the dump site was an issue of contention, even for me, but if you go there now, the place is clean.\n\nThe place has no smell. The place has been effectively managed. If you remember, we, as the residents or as the city council at that time, said we would not pay, and the payment was done from the central fiscus. They have sorted the place out, and the residents did not have to pay.\n\nThat is a model that seems to work. We might have issues with it, but those are issues that we can address, said Mafume.\n\n",
