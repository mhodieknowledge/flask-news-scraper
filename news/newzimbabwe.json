Since his arrival, he has featured in every match his new team has played.\n\nHis latest outing came over the weekend when he helped Marinhense advance to the second round of the Taa de Portugal knockout tournament.\n\nIts always difficult to adapt to a new environment, but Im happy with how Im settling in here. My teammates and coaches have welcomed me warmly, Chimedza said.\n\nIve played at least four competitive games so far, and in our last cup match, I was pleased to contribute to the teams progress to the next stage.\n\nChimedza signed for Gil Vicente earlier this year but was unable to feature due to delays in the clearance of his international papers. As a result, he was loaned out to gain game time and experience.\n\nThe former MK Dons player hopes his spell at Marinhense will prepare him for a return to his parent club.\n\nMy focus is on working hard and contributing to Marinhenses success. At the end of the season, my target is to return to Gil Vicente and cement my place in the team, he added.\n\nBorn in Harare, Chimedza moved to England at the age of 14 after being scouted by English League Two side MK Dons, where he developed before moving to Portugal this year.\n\n",

This income stream is generated by fees for transactions such as withdrawals, transfers, currency exchanges, and card issuance, as well as commissions.\n\nPresenting the groups half-years performance this week, NMBZ CEO, Gerald Gore, said a total ZWG623,3 million was generated compared to ZWG383,6 million generated last year under the same revenue category.\n\nThis indicator confirms the earlier complaints by the banking public on the need for monetary authorities to prevent banks from charging high commission fees.\n\nHigh charges have been singled out for discouraging Zimbabweans from using formal banking services in favour of risky informal systems.\n\nA recent study by the National Economic Competitiveness Forum (NECF) also revealed that the cost of banking in Zimbabwe is a bit on the high side when compared to best practices.\n\nMeanwhile, during the period under review,the group operated profitably for the period under review, generating a comprehensive income of ZWG 98.9 million for the period compared to ZWG56,1 million for the prior comparative period.\n\nRestructuring expenses of ZWG138,5 million were incurred during the year, primarily related to a change in strategic focus towards a digital and more efficient operation. These costs include severance payments and other termination costs.\n\nTotal assets closed the period at ZWG7.8 billion, up 6% from ZWG7.4 billion as at 31 December 2024. The growth was largely funded by an increase in customer deposits. Loans and advances stood at ZWG3.4 billion as at 30 June 2025, up from ZWG2.9 billion as at 31 December 2024.\n\nThe growth was driven by the deployment of foreign lines of credit, largely to exporting companies. The groups focus remains on maintaining a robust credit risk management framework to ensure a sustainable quality portfolio.\n\n",

            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nHUMAN rights defenders have criticised the recent bombing of opposition leader Job Sikhalas Chitungwiza home, amid fears of a renewed wave of raids on properties linked to exiled Zimbabweans.\n\nThe alleged bombing of Sikhalas house while he was away in South Africa raises the spectre of a fresh campaign of political persecution, says human rights activist Munacho Humbasha.\n\nHe says the attack on Sikhalas house is a chilling message to critics of Zanu PF, both at home and abroad.\n\nSikhala, a former legislator and long-time government critic, has been frequenting South Africa for medical and political engagements.\n\nHumbasha told NewZimbabwe.com that Zanu PF functionaries and State security agents have openly declared war on activists in the diaspora, with families back home being deliberately targeted.\n\nThose with houses visited in the widening campaign and searches include that of Petty Ziramba, Panganayi Mauzinyu, Ralph Dube, Fransisca Chiduku, and Shepherd Yuda, said Humbasha.\n\nIn Mabvuku, unknown men believed to be State agents raided the home of the late opposition activist Tonderai Ndira. The assailants took household property and left the house empty, promising to return and destroy their livelihoods. The family is still in shock.\n\nIn Harare, suspected operatives broke into Blessing Makeyis house and again into his family home, allegedly searching for incriminating material. Makevi has been active in diaspora protests against President Emmerson Mnangagwas government, Humbasha told NewZimbabwe.com in an interview.\n\nAlso, another dissenter, Ralph Dubes family, is living in uncertainty after receiving threatening messages, says Humbasha.\n\nBack home, he further claimed, several homes in Seke, Chitungwiza, having been visited by suspicious individuals in recent days, thereby sparking fears in the community.\n\nDespite repeated reports of break-ins and intimidation, police have not arrested anyone in connection with the incidents. Efforts to get a comment from police national spokesman, Commissioner Paul Nyathi, were fruitless by the time of publishing.\n\nVictims and their families say the inaction points to the States complicity.\n\nThis is meant to punish those of us who are in the UK and elsewhere. Our families are being harassed everyday because we speak out, said UK-based activist, Melody Magejo, who spoke to NewZimbabwe.com in a telephone interview.\n\nA human rights lawyer, who preferred anonymity, said as Mnangagwa gravitates towards entrenching his rule through his 2030 agenda, the political environment is set to worsen.\n\nThe use of Patriotic Act and Cyber Security Act 2023 will lead to many arrests of those who are actively participating in campaigns on social media.\n\nIt is without a doubt that Mnangagwas government does not want the outside world to know what is happening in the country, said the lawyer.\n\n",

The lack of clarity is creating devastating consequences, they said.\n\nAccording to HSF and CoRMSA, many Zimbabweans on the permit have already lost jobs, struggled to enrol their children for the 2026 school year, and faced difficulties accessing basic healthcare. They argue that these hardships show why the government must act well before the November deadline.\n\nHSF and CoRMSA call on the Minister of Home Affairs to urgently provide clarity on the status of the consultation process, theorganisations insisted.\n\nIf the process cannot be implemented in time, government must extend the ZEP well before the November deadline. Such action is necessary to prevent further hardship and to uphold fairness and the rule of law.\n\nThe ZEP, first introduced in 2009 to regularise the stay of Zimbabweans in South Africa, has faced years of uncertainty.\n\nA June 2023 High Court ruling ordered the Department of Home Affairs to ensure a fair process before terminating the programme, a decision later confirmed by the Constitutional Court.\n\nAs a result, the permit remains valid until late November 2025.\n\nBut with only months left before that deadline, rights groups warn that the clock is ticking and that delay is once again throwing thousands of lives into chaos.\n\n",
