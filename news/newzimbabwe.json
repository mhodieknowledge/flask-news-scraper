            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has ordered a private security guard and his employer, Javelin Trading (Pvt) Ltd, to pay nearly US$49,000 in damages to a Nyabira police officer and farmer, who was left permanently disabled after being shot in the back during a farm patrol.\n\nJustice Gladys Mhuri ruled that guard Casten Suwedi acted negligently when he opened fire on Calisto Mujera at Gwebi South Farm on April 26, 2020, leaving him partially paralysed. The court found Javelin Trading, which employed and armed Suwedi, vicariously liable.The second defendant did not shout at the person to stop. He aimed at the vehicle without ascertaining whether there were any people there. A reasonable person exercising due care would have foreseen that aiming at the motor vehicle he was likely to hit a person, Justice Mhuri said.I find, therefore, that the second defendant was negligent and his negligence caused the plaintiff to sustain the injuries which left him disabled.Mujera had sued for US$331,590 in special and general damages, claiming loss of income, farming produce, medical bills and future expenses.The court, however, trimmed the award to US$48,920.66, covering verified medical, transport, and farm losses, as well as compensation for pain, suffering and loss of amenities.General damages are not a penalty but compensation, Justice Mhuri stressed.The award is designed to compensate the victim and not to punish the wrongdoer.According to testimony, Mujera was driving with his son on the evening of April 26, 2020, when he stopped near Javelin Farm after noticing suspicious movements. As he disembarked to inspect his overheating car, Suwedi, who was on patrol, shone a torch from the maize field and fired a shot, hitting Mujera in the back.I shouted that I was a police officer, Mujera testified, adding that no warning shot was given.All I saw was a light and then I heard a bang.The bullet left shrapnel lodged in his spine, causing permanent damage to his lower body. He spent weeks at Parirenyatwa Hospital and months at Chikurubi Police Hospital, undergoing treatment and physiotherapy. Medical reports confirmed he will live with chronic pain, weakness and loss of function in his lower limbs.Mujera told the court the injuries destroyed his farming business, cost him his formal employment, and left him humiliated after local media reports suggested he had been shot while stealing maize. He and his son were later acquitted of theft charges in the Norton Magistrates Court.Suwedi argued that he had caught Mujera and others harvesting maize under cover of night and claimed he fired only after giving a warning. But the judge dismissed his version, describing him as not a truthful witness who gave conflicting accounts of the shooting.Javelin Trading, which provided Suwedi with a firearm despite his lack of formal weapons training, chose not to lead any evidence in its defence. The court held it responsible as the employer.In the circumstances, first defendant is liable for the second defendants actions and the resultant injuries suffered by plaintiff, Mhuri ruled.The court granted Mujera US$33,920.66 in special damages, including medical and transport costs and farm income losses, US$10,000 for pain, suffering, and permanent disablement, US$5,000 for loss of amenities, including the inability to perform normal family and social functions.In total, US$48,920.66 is to be paid jointly by Javelin Trading and Suwedi, with one paying absolving the other.\n\nJustice Gladys Mhuri ruled that guard Casten Suwedi acted negligently when he opened fire on Calisto Mujera at Gwebi South Farm on April 26, 2020, leaving him partially paralysed.

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nTHE High Court has ruled in favour of top businessman and lawyer Tawanda Nyambirais company, TN Baker (Pvt) Ltd, in a bitter property dispute, ordering the eviction of AmarisSA (Pvt) Ltd from a contested section of prime Harare real estate.Justices Faith Mushure and Joseph Chilimbe set aside a magistrates court decision and held that TN Baker had a valid lease for 17 Samora Machel Avenue, while AmarisSA had unlawfully encroached onto its premises.The appeal is allowed with costs, Justice Mushure wrote.The application for eviction be and is hereby granted the respondent and all those claiming occupation through it are ordered to vacate forthwith.The ruling ends a long-running feud between the two companies over shops and a delivery panhandle within the commercial property.TN Baker argued it was paying rentals for 711 square metres but was only occupying 668 square metres, with AmarisSAs subtenants taking up part of its leased space.AmarisSA denied the encroachment, arguing that there were material disputes of fact and insisting TN Baker had no locus standi. But the judges dismissed that stance, finding the encroachment was backed by an expert surveyors report which went uncontested.This is a typical case where the court was confronted by a mere allegation of a possible dispute of fact, Justice Mushure said. The holder of a lease has a clear right derived from the lease agreement to take occupation of the property leased to him and to sue for the eviction of any illegal occupier.The court ordered that if AmarisSA fails to vacate voluntarily, the Messenger of Court must immediately enforce the eviction.The legal battle has its roots in a complex history of leases involving TN Baker, its sister companies, and property owner Glicknett Investments. In 2016, AmarisSA relinquished its rights to No. 17 Samora Machel Avenue, acknowledging that TN entities would negotiate directly with Glicknett. TN Baker subsequently secured a direct lease, valid until October 2026.Despite that, disputes flared again in 2024 when TN Baker accused AmarisSA of encroachment. The magistrates court dismissed TN Bakers application, but the High Court has now cleared the way for eviction.Lawyers Beatrice Mtetwa & Tawanda Nyambirai Legal Practitioners represented TN Baker, while James Majatame Attorneys acted for AmarisSA.\n\nTHE High Court has ruled in favour of top businessman and lawyer Tawanda Nyambirais company, TN Baker (Pvt) Ltd, in a bitter property dispute, ordering the eviction of AmarisSA (Pvt) Ltd from a contested section of prime Harare real estate.\n\nJustices Faith Mushure and Joseph Chilimbe set aside a magistrates court decision and held that TN Baker had a valid lease for 17 Samora Machel Avenue, while AmarisSA had unlawfully encroached onto its premises.The appeal is allowed with costs, Justice Mushure wrote.The application for eviction be and is hereby granted the respondent and all those claiming occupation through it are ordered to vacate forthwith.The ruling ends a long-running feud between the two companies over shops and a delivery panhandle within the commercial property.TN Baker argued it was paying rentals for 711 square metres but was only occupying 668 square metres, with AmarisSAs subtenants taking up part of its leased space.AmarisSA denied the encroachment, arguing that there were material disputes of fact and insisting TN Baker had no locus standi.
