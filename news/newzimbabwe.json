The coach has since apologised and stepped down from his role as Warriors assistant coach.\n\nIn a statement, the PSL said both Chiragwi and Ngezi Platinum Stars had been called to appear before its Disciplinary Committee over misconduct during the Castle Lager Premier Soccer League match played at Rufaro Stadium on October 4, 2025.\n\nTakesure Chiragwis charges include violent and disorderly conduct, as well as improper behaviour likely to bring the game into disrepute. Ngezi Platinum Stars FC faces charges of disturbing the normal proceedings of a match and improper conduct exhibited by its technical team and players, the PSL said.\n\nLast week, Makuwe released a statement defending Chiragwi, stating that the coachs hand had accidentally come in contact with his face.\n\nChiragwi becomes only the second football official to face PSL disciplinary action over violent conduct towards a player. Earlier this year, Yadah FC board member Spencer Muvadi was found guilty of assaulting goalkeeper Godknows Gurure and received a one-year suspension from all football activities.\n\n",

            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nTHE explosive dossier presented by Vice President Constantino Chiwenga to Zanu PFs powerful Politburo on September 17 this year has been leaked.\n\nDetailing grand corruption by President Emmerson Mnangagwas monied allies, Chiwengas dossier warned prevailing conditions were exactly what led to their decision to oust late President Robert Mugabe in a November 2017 coup.\n\nThe dossier names businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei, shadowy Wicknell Chivayo, questionable Delish Nguwaya and Scottland FC owner Pedzisayi Scott Sakupwanya as some of the corrupt individuals who have been milking Zimbabwes coffers.\n\nComrade President, we undertook Operation Restore Legacy with a sacred mandate: to reclaim our nation from the jaws of corruption and to restore the dignity, prosperity, and sovereignty of Zimbabwe for its people, said Chiwenga.\n\nComrade President, in November 2017, we took a bold and necessary step to remove former President Robert Mugabe from power, because he sought to manipulate our Constitution for personal gain.\n\nHe allowed certain individuals and family to seize his executive authority and abuse it, he ignored the suffering of the people while a corrupt elite looted with impunity, he turned ZANU-PF into a personal fiefdom, disregarding its founding values.\n\nDuring November 2017, we risked everything our lives, our freedom, our futures to restore and defend our legacy, the Party and the Constitution.\n\nToday, history is repeating itself in the most shameful way Comrade President. Why we find ourselves in this situation is both shocking and shameful.\n\nComrade President, on several occasions and even abroad, you have informed the nation that you are a Constitutionalist and yet it is now clear for anyone to see that the so-called 2030 Agenda to extend your term of office is real and alive, and this has now taken us back to the ills that led us to November 2017.\n\nMoreover, the drivers of this so-called 2030 Agenda have now made corruption, looting of our state coffers and bribery of our structures the cornerstone of their contribution to this campaign, and this is now destroying our Party and violating our Constitution.\n\nChiwenga claimed Tagwirei, Nguwaya, Sakupwanya and Chivayo had siphoned over US$3.2 billion from the state in shadowy deals that include the sale of party shares in Tagwireis Kuvimba and Great Dyke Investment, Nguwayas Geo-Pomona initiative, Chivayos Zimbabwe Electoral Commission (ZEC) scandal and gold purchases by Sakupwanya.\n\nMnangagwa, whose supporters are demanding that he illegally extend his second term to 2030, is said to favour Tagwirei as his successor instead of Chiwenga.\n\nChiwenga is eyeing the top post, having expected to take over in 2023.\n\nAdded Chiwenga: The reality which is clearly emerging is that this 2030 Agenda is being funded and driven by known criminals who have brazenly looted our state coffers with impunity and are now using these resources whose capture and control of our Party is unprecedented and deeply worrying.\n\nKudakwashe Tagwirei, Wicknell Chivhayo, Scott Sakupwanya, and Delish Nguwaya, amongst others, structure and in the process destroy our Party.\n\nChiwenga demanded their immediate arrests, twice telling Mnangagwa that the time for inaction had long passed.\n\nComrade President, tirikuti vanhu ava, Kudakwashe Tagwirei, Wicknell Chivhayo, Scott Sakupwanya, and Delish Nguwaya, and their associates, ngavasungwe, immediately for these unprecedented crimes they have committed, he said.\n\nComrade President, the time for silence and inaction is over, and we cannot allow these criminals who have stolen from our Government coffers and our Party to start using the same resources to bribe fellow comrades and our structures to get their support, defend and protect them.\n\nThe time for silence and inaction is over, Comrade President. We, as the Partys Presidium, have serious issues to immediately deal with that will define our future, and we must immediately prioritise cleaning our house, reclaim our State and our Party from the capture by Kudakwashe Tagwirei, Wicknell Chivhayo, Scott Sakupwanya, and Delish Nguwaya and their associates.\n\nThe leaking of Chiwengas dossier indicates a turning point in Zanu PFs worsening factional fights.\n\nDespite being an obvious escalation of the battle for power between Chiwenga and Mnangagwa, it is the first time private confrontations between the two have been made public.\n\nTheir relationship is reportedly now similar to the one Mnangagwa had with his predecessor, Mugabe.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nTHE Ministry of Transport and Infrastructure Development (MoTID) has ordered a five-day long closure of one of Harares strategic roads, Glenara Road, to pave the way for rehabilitation works.\n\nThe countrys road rehabilitation is driven by the Emergency Road Rehabilitation Programme (ERRP), initiated after a 2021 state of national disaster declaration due to poor road conditions. This programme focuses on repairing a significant portion of the road network, aiming to improve safety, stimulate economic activity, and connect communities to essential services like health, education, and markets.\n\nTo date, major road uplifts have been undertaken along the countrys major highways to revamp the countrys roads infrastructure.\n\nIn a statement, the MoTID announced that Glenara Road will not be accessible due to ongoing works.\n\nThe MoTID wishes to notify the motoring public and residents of the temporary partial closure of a section of Glenara Road to facilitate essential road rehabilitation works.\n\nAs part of the governments ongoing road infrastructure rehabilitation programme, this project aims to enhance road safety drainage and travel conditions for all users, said the ministry in a statement.\n\nThe affected section of Genara Road is between Service Station and Samora Machel Avenue will be partially closed to through traffic.\n\nMotorists travelling from ED Mnangagwa Road were advised to follow the designated detour, which proceeds via Glen Roy, turns onto Sloane Street, continues on Montgomery Road, then onto Rhodesville Avenue and finally rejoins Glenara Road via Samora Machel Avenue.\n\nProperties within the construction zone will remain accessible, with traffic management personnel on site to assist residents and businesses. To ensure the safety of all motorists and construction personnel and facilitate a smooth flow of traffic, the ministry strongly advises the public to obey all posted traffic signs and instruction from officials, drive with caution and at reduced speeds through the affected area, and allow for extra travel time to their schedules, the ministry added.\n\n",
