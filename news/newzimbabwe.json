            "content": "IOL\n\nSOUTH AFRICA  A foreign national employee must be provided with proper notice of their termination in line with the Basic Conditions of Employment Act (BCA). Failure to provide such notice may result in the termination being unlawful.\n\nThis is the warning of employment law experts at Cliffe Dekker Hofmeyr (CDH), following a recent Eastern Cape High Court judgment.\n\nThis was after an application by a research assistant and Zimbabwean national, Samuel Nyakudya.\n\nHe was granted a temporary residence permit allowing him to reside in South Africa and seek employment in the category of general work as provided for under the Immigration Act.\n\nHis employer, the OR Tambo District Municipality, however, terminated his employment contract due to allegations of its unlawfulness and irregularity.\n\nCommenting on the case, CDH said that this area of termination has just become a lot clearer for employers after the recent ruling, stating that employing a foreign national without a work visa does not automatically grant an employer the right to summarily terminate the employment contract.\n\nThis indicates a key warning for employers highlighting their responsibility to act lawfully and in accordance with the BCA, CDH said.\n\nThe experts explained that a foreign national employee must be provided with proper notice of their termination in line with the BCA. Failure to provide such notice may result in the termination being unlawful. The dismissal may also be found to be unfair in the CCMA (Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration).\n\nNyakudya was employed on successive fixed-term contracts, but following the expiration of his last contract, the municipality allowed him to continue working without a new fixed-term contract.\n\nThroughout his employment, Nyakudya was not consistently in possession of a work visa. In November 2023, the municipality notified him that his contract had expired on March 31, 2022, and that he had failed to provide a copy of his South African identity document, despite being requested to do so.\n\nConsequently, the municipality claimed it had no choice but to terminate his employment immediately, citing the unlawful nature of his contract due to the expiration of his work visa.\n\nWhile Nyakudya could have contested the fairness of his dismissal before the CCMA, he opted to challenge the termination in the High Court.\n\nThe court ultimately ruled that Nyakudyas employment contract termination was unlawful..\n\nCDH said the Immigration Act outlines an employers responsibilities regarding the employment of foreign nationals, specifically in Section 38, which prohibits the employment of illegal foreigners or those whose status does not authorise them to work.\n\nIt said the court also referenced Section 49(3) of the Immigration Act, which states that employing an illegal foreigner or a foreigner in violation of the Act constitutes a criminal offence.\n\nThe court confirmed that such employment is punishable by fines or imprisonment upon conviction.\n\nRegarding the summary termination of Nyakudyas contract, the court considered Section 37(1) of the BCEA, which stipulates the notice period required for termination based on the duration of employment.\n\nThe court highlighted that the purpose of providing notice is to allow employees to prepare for a smooth transition.\n\nNyakudyas lack of a work visa or South African identity document was a critical factor in the case. The court determined that employing a foreign national without a work visa is prohibited, and thus, the municipalitys immediate termination of Nyakudyas contract was unlawful.\n\nThis case serves as a significant reminder that employing a foreign national without a work visa does not automatically grant an employer the right to terminate the employment contract summarily, CDH warned.\n\n",

Sorry for the outage.SpaceXwill remedy root cause to ensure it doesnt happen again, the SpaceX CEO wrote on X.\n\nThe outage was a rare hiccup for SpaceXs most commercially sensitive business that had experts speculating whether the service, known for its resilience and rapid growth, had been beset by a glitch, a botched software update or even a cyber-attack.\n\nDoug Madory, an expert at the internet analysis firm Kentik, said the outage was global and that such a sweeping interruption was unusual.\n\nThis is likely the longest outage ever for Starlink, at least while it became a major service provider, Madory said.\n\nAs Starlink has gained more users, SpaceX has focused heavily in recent months on updating its network to accommodate demands for higher speed and bandwidth.\n\nThe company, in a partnership with T-Mobile, is also expanding the constellation with larger, more powerful satellites to offer direct-to-cell text-messaging services, a line of business in which mobile phone users can send emergency text messages through the network in rural areas.\n\nSpaceX has launched more than 8,000 Starlink satellites since 2020, building a uniquely distributed network in low Earth orbit that has attracted intense demand from militaries, transportation industries and consumers in rural areas with poor access to traditional, fiber-based internet.\n\nId speculate this is a bad software update, not entirely dissimilar to the CrowdStrike mess with Windows last year, or a cyber-attack, said Gregory Falco, director of a space and cybersecurity laboratory at Cornell University.\n\nAn update to CrowdStrikes widely used cybersecurity software led to worldwide flight cancellations and affected industries around the globe in July last year. The outage disrupted internet services, affecting 8.5 million Microsoft Windows devices.\n\nIt was unclear whether Thursdays outage affected SpaceXs other satellite-based services that rely on the Starlink network. Starshield, the companys military satellite business unit, has billions of dollars worth of contracts with the Pentagon and US intelligence agencies.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nDeputy Finance Minister David Mnangagwa has said the Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill represents a bold step toward equitable economic reform, insisting Zimbabwes vast mineral wealth must uplift all citizens, not only a privileged minority.\n\nSpeaking Wednesday at a meeting with Zanu PF youths, government, and party officials at the partys headquarters, Mnangagwa said the long-awaited Bill offers a blueprint for a more inclusive and transparent mining sector.\n\nAmong the attendees were Youth Minister Tino Machakaire and Zanu PF National Political Commissar Munyaradzi Machacha. The gathering deliberated on the far-reaching provisions of the Bill.\n\nFrom the Ministry of Finances perspective, this Bill presents an opportunity not only to modernise the countrys mining governance framework, but also to lay the foundation for a more inclusive, transparent, and fiscally sustainable mining economy, Mnangagwa said.\n\nHe added that the ministry was particularly encouraged by the deliberate and progressive fiscal support mechanisms embedded in the Bill,provisions he said would attract new investment, improve compliance, and ensure Zimbabweans benefit fully from their mineral resources.\n\nZimbabwes mining sector, according to Mnangagwa, contributes over 60% of export earnings and nearly 13% of the national GDP. It directly and indirectly employs hundreds of thousands and is a key pillar in the countrys drive toward attaining Vision 2030.\n\nHowever, he lamented that outdated regulations, opaque licensing systems, and weak institutional coordination had long stifled growth in the sector.\n\nThe Mines and Minerals Amendment Bill responds directly to these challenges by introducing a robust and transparent framework that enables better fiscal planning, incentivises investment, and enhances accountability in the exploitation of mineral resources, he said.\n\nThe meeting also featured open dialogue with youths, who raised concerns over limited access to information and markets.\n\nRobert Togarepi, a youth from Gutu, highlighted the lack of resources available to young people seeking to participate in the mining sector. Meanwhile, Kumbirai Maunganidze from Harare expressed frustration over the absence of domestic markets for semi-precious stones.\n\nWe have vast amounts of semi-precious minerals, but theres no market for them in Zimbabwe. How can we be assisted to market these special stones, other than just gold? Maunganidze asked.\n\nIn response, Mnangagwa reaffirmed the ministrys commitment to implementing the fiscal tools in the Bill with diligence, integrity, and accountability.\n\nWe believe the Bill strikes the right balance between encouraging investment and ensuring that the State and citizens receive their fair share of the value extracted from our natural resources, he said.\n\nNotably, the Bill promotes local value addition by offering a full rebate on royalties for minerals used entirely within Zimbabwe. It also mandates the publication of mining contracts and revenue data, a move aligned with global best practices under the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI).\n\nMnangagwa stressed that legislation alone is insufficient. He said the government was also rolling out complementary policy and institutional reforms, including the deployment of digital systems to enable real-time monitoring of mineral production and revenue flows.\n\n",

The countrys biggest platinum miner has already allocated $1.1 billion of its 10-year investment plan, which runs through 2031, she added.\n\nThe plant is well positioned to handle feeds from other PGM producers presently in existence and in the future, she said, referring to so-called platinum group metals used in several industries for their resistance to corrosion and heat, as well as catalytic properties.\n\nThe expansion reflects a wider push across Africa to add value to natural resources before exporting them. Several mining operations in the continent have been seized or disrupted due to disputes with governments over taxes and investments, such as Barrick Mining Corps Loulo-Gounkoto gold complex in Mali. In Zimbabwe, the central banks retention of hard currency from exporters has been one of the challenges faced by producers.\n\nOrleyn told Bloomberg on the sidelines of the ceremony that the company has raised concerns about the countrys currency volatility with the Zimbabwean authorities.\n\nThere is a sense that this is a long-term relationship and the currency volatility in a geopolitical environment as we are facing at the moment is something to be expected, she said\n\nThe Southern African nation has the worlds third-largest platinum reserves after Russia and South Africa.\n\nZimbabwe generates more than half of its revenues from exports of minerals including gold, chrome and diamonds.\n\n",
