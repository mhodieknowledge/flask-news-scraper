            "content": "Once, playing at a casino meant getting dressed, going out, and settling in for hours at the tables. For plenty of players, that was part of the magic, from the atmosphere to the sense of occasion. But times have changed. Todays players want something different. They want flexibility, ease, and most of all, speed. Thats why mobile casinos have stepped in and taken over  and why they arent giving the market back anytime soon.\n\nIn the modern world, everything competes for attention. People expect to do things quickly and on their terms. Streaming shows, ordering food, and messaging friends  it all happens in an instant. Casino gaming has followed suit. Online platforms likeBetway casinohave made it possible for players to enjoy their favorite games without being tied to a desktop or traditional casino floor. Slots, roulette, blackjack, and newer favorites like Aviator are now just a tap away.\n\nThis shift isnt just about going mobile for the sake of it. Its about making the experience fit into real life. Players no longer need to plan their gaming sessions around big blocks of free time; Whether its during a lunch break, while commuting, or unwinding after a long day, mobile casinos adapt to a players schedule. That kind of convenience has changed how people engage with games.\n\nBut speed matters just as much as accessibility. Mobile casinos thrive because they offer fast-loading games that get straight to the action. Nobody wants to wait through endless animations or clunky menus. Aviator, for example, is designed perfectly for mobile play. The concept is simple  watch the multiplier rise, decide when to cash out, and try to stay ahead of the crash. Its easy to grasp, fast to play, and perfect for those short bursts of entertainment that mobile users often prefer.\n\nPlatforms like Betway understand this balance. They have invested in delivering smooth, responsive gameplay that works seamlessly across devices. Menus are clear, loading is quick, and nothing gets in the way. The result? Players dive straight into the game without wrestling with slow screens or clunky menus. Its smooth, simple, and exactly how it should be.\n\nAnother major factor is choice. Mobile casinos today arent limited in the way they once were. Modern platforms offer hundreds, sometimes thousands, of games right at your fingertips. Whether youre a fan of classic slots or prefer newer concepts like crash games, theres always something ready to play. This variety ensures that mobile players get the same rich experience they would expect from a traditional online casino, if not more.\n\nWhat ties all of this together is trust. Players need to feel confident that mobile play doesnt mean sacrificing security or fairness. Thats why established names like Betway continue to lead. Their platforms offer not only speed and convenience but also the reliability and transparency players expect. From encrypted transactions to clear game rules, everything is designed with user confidence in mind.\n\nIn the end, the rise of mobile casinos isnt a temporary trend. Its a response to what players want today. Fast, flexible, and user-focused gaming experiences are here to stay. Whether youre chasing multipliers in Aviator or spinning the reels, mobile platforms have proven they can deliver  wherever and whenever you choose to play.\n\n",

            "content": "By Dr Richard Dune\n\nAn in-depth look at the fourth shift the NHS urgently needs, moving from research to reality to strengthen care across all system parts.\n\nWhen people across Africa think of the UKs National Health Service (NHS), they often think of excellence, world-class teaching hospitals, cutting-edge medicine, and free care at the point of delivery. For many Zimbabweans in the diaspora, the NHS is not only a place of work but also a lifeline for their families and communities. But beneath that reputation lies a system now in critical flux, and the stakes have never been higher.\n\nWith the dissolution of NHS England, budget pressures on Integrated Care Boards (ICBs), and uncertainty over future innovation funding, we are seeing the end of a chapter in British healthcare. Yet this moment also offers a unique opportunity: to reshape the NHS into something more resilient, equitable, and innovative, particularly for the communities that have often been overlooked.\n\nEarlier this year, the Wellcome Trust issued a powerful directive: make research and innovation the fourth strategic shift in the NHS. This new shift should sit alongside three long-standing goals:\n\nBut heres the truth: the other three shifts cant succeed without the fourth. The system will continue to buckle under pressure without innovation in everyday NHS practice, especially outside major hospitals.\n\nMany Zimbabweans working in health and social care across the UK are not based in elite hospitals like Cambridge or Imperial. They work in care homes, GP practices, district nursing, home care services, and mental health support roles. Yet innovation and research funding rarely reach these corners of the system.\n\nIf we truly believe that healthcare happens in the community, research and innovation must follow. But today, those working on the frontlines often lack:\n\nThis is where the disconnect lies, and where the opportunity begins.\n\nThe NHS isnt just struggling with inertia; its navigating a storm:\n\nAnd yet, innovation cant be an afterthought. It must be a daily part of delivering care, from the inner-city clinic in London to the remote outreach teams in Cornwall.\n\nTo moveFrom Research to Reality, we need five bold changes, especially in community and primary care settings:\n\nThis is not about research for its own sake. Its about:\n\nFor those of us from Zimbabwe and across Southern Africa, this conversation matters more than we might think. Many of us are part of the NHS workforce. Some of us are carers, nurses, consultants, therapists, or tech innovators. We see the cracks in the system every day, but we also see the possibilities.\n\nInnovation is not just the responsibility of those in power. Its a shared duty, especially for those on the frontline, those building health and social care businesses, and those leading change in community settings.\n\nWhat lessons can Zimbabwe and the wider region draw from this? That innovation in healthcare doesnt have to wait for billion-pound hospitals. It can start in clinics, mobile health units, digital tools, and grassroots participation. Just like the NHS must now reimagine itself from the ground up, many African systems have the opportunity to leapfrog legacy issues and build responsive, community-led health models using research, data, and locally relevant solutions.\n\nFor those working in or with the NHS, this is also a moment to shape the system from within, by championing local trials, sharing insights, and refusing to let bureaucracy block progress.\n\nAs the NHS evolves in this new post-structure era, lets not wait for permission to innovate. Lets build a system where research is part of daily life, not a distant concept confined to academia. Because without this fourth shift, the other three wont just stalltheyll collapse.\n\nAnd for the NHS, diaspora communities who rely on it, and global health systems looking on,there is no future without innovation.\n\nDr Richard Dune is the CEO of LearnPac Systems, a leading UK provider of edtech and compliance software solutions for regulated sectors.

It was transformed into a multi-level interchange aimed at easing traffic congestion and boosting regional trade.\n\nWhile the development promises improved infrastructure and economic benefits, it has faced criticism over its high cost, safety concerns, and a questionable renaming after President Emmerson Mnangagwa, whose wartime nickname was Trabablas.\n\nSituated in the heart of Harare, where Simon Mazorodze, Chitungwiza, and High Glen roads converge, the massive infrastructure project has been taking shape for years.\n\nAccording to government, the roadworks are a critical junction along the Harare-Beitbridge highway and touted as a game-changer for easing traffic congestion and boosting regional trade.\n\nThe Mbudzi roundabout, as it was previously known, was a notorious bottleneck in Harare. During peak hours, commuters faced agonizing delays as vehicles from western Chitungwiza, surrounding suburbs, and the Harare-Masvingo highway converged in a chaotic snarl.\n\nHeavy regional traffic heading to and from South Africa exacerbated the gridlock.

If the releases are not done on time, unfortunately, it is outside of our purview. It is not what we can do. We can make promises. We want to keep to the timeline. If the money comes, we will do our best.\n\nThe contractors are on site. They have every intention, every incentive for them to complete the work. They want to continue and move on. This is a dam that is so fundamental. I have personally visited it more than 20 times and I know the impact it has on the community, he said.\n\nHe said the project is of paramount importance for the communities, not only of the Matabeleland provinces but also of Bulawayo, where 276 kilometres of reticulation will finally end the water woes of the southern region.\n\nThe other impediment with regard to this specific dam is that if we are only given, for example, two million dollars, this means no changes at the Gwayi-Shangani Dam. We require four million US dollars for the dam to be raised another two metres. Every two metres costs four million US dollars. If you are given three million nine hundred thousand, it still cannot be raised until we get the full four million. Not part of it because of the type of dam that we are building. The releases cannot be in drips and drops. They have to be in multipliers of four million and above, said Haritatos.\n\nHe implored stakeholders to encourage the Treasury to prioritise the completion of the dam.\n\n",

            "content": "BBC\n\nCare providers have said the government is taking away the lifeline of overseas recruitment without fixing the problems that make it difficult to recruit UK staff.\n\nSir Keir Starmer, the prime minister, announced sweeping reforms to immigration on Monday, including plans to end the recruitment of care workers from overseas.\n\nEven with staff being brought in from other countries,official estimates show there were 131,000 vacanciesin social care in England last year.\n\nCare companies said some services will struggle to survive without international recruits.\n\nThe sector has been propping itself up with dwindling resources, rising costs, and mounting vacancies, said Prof Martin Green of Care England, which describes itself as the largest representative body for independent care providers.\n\nTaking (international recruitment) away now with no warning, no funding, and no alternative, is not just short-sighted  its cruel, he said.\n\nSir Keir said the visa changes were part of a drive to reduce immigration significantly and that the government wanted to create a migration system that is controlled, selective and fair.\n\nThe government said care providers could extend visas for existing staff and recruit migrants already in the UK who have yet to find a job. It also promised a new fair pay agreement for care staff and wanted companies to recruit and train more people from UK.\n\nHowever, Dr Jane Townson of the Homecare Association said the government was introducing the changes in a vacuum as a fair pay agreement is a long way off and there is no plan to deliver the care workers our country needs.\n\nSocial care has been in crisis for years, with council funding of services squeezed, significant staff-shortages and growing demand from an ageing population. Plans for reform have been delayed time and again.\n\nWhile care workers were clapped along with health workers during the pandemic, that did not translate into an improvement in pay or status.\n\nAbout 1.7 million people work in social care in England, according to Skills for Care, the official body that monitors the workforce.It is often a minimum or just above minimum wage job, with little recognition of the increasing responsibility and complexity of the support staff provide to older and disabled people.\n\nPutting it bluntly, if someone can earn more working, for instance, in a supermarket for fewer, less strenuous hours, then that is the option many will chose.\n\nPost-Covid, some staff left care work because they felt burnt out while others who still loved the job felt they could not afford the increases in the cost of living.\n\nBetween April 2021 and March 2022, social care vacanciesreached a record highof 165,000, a 52% increase on the year before.\n\nBy December 2021, the warnings of imminent collapse prompted Boris Johnsons Conservative government to make care work a shortage occupation,making it easier for companies to look overseas for staff.\n\nRecruits had to earn a minimum of 20,480 a year to qualify for the visa, and they could bring family with them.\n\nThere wasa rapid rise in overseas recruitment in 2022/23 80,000 people arrived in the UK to work in care and in 23/24, there were another 105,000 visas.\n\nMany care companies said bringing in those staff was the difference between providing services and collapsing. However, there was also abuse of this new route into the UK. For instance,some people were exploited, ending up paying middlemen thousands for travel and sponsorship certificates.\n\nThe Home Office says 470 care companies have had their licence to recruit international staff revoked since 2022. It estimates that has led to about 40,000 staff being displaced. Companies say many will have already found alternative care work.\n\nIn March 2024, Rishi Sunaks Conservative government tightened the visa requirements. This included saying recruits could no longer bring family with them. It has led to a significant fall in the number of care workers arriving from abroad.\n\nIn the year up to December 2024, 9,500 visas were granted to people entering the UK to provide caring personal services, according to the government.\n\nHowever, in the four years since staff shortages were most acute, relatively little has changed to encourage more UK people to work in care. There has been anongoing government funded recruitment campaignand talk of the need to improve the pay and status of staff, but many workers fear solutions remain a long way off.\n\nThe independent Casey Commission started work last month to draw up plans for adult social care. It has been described by ministers as a once in a generation opportunity to transcend party politics and build consensus on the future of the sector. Its first update is due next year and its final report by 2028.\n\nAt a time when the NHS is struggling, social care is more important than ever as it can keep vulnerable people out of hospital and support patients when they return home.\n\nMany care workers will say it is an incredibly rewarding job and with overseas recruitment being closed, the question is what needs to change to encourage more UK people to take on the role?\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nINDUSTRY and Commerce Minister, Mangaliso Ndlovu, says repetitive licenses, which are negatively contributing towards unsustainable overhead costs for companies, will be history in six months time.\n\nThe challenge of numerous licenses has dogged the economy for years amid indications that, for instance, for one to operate a single supermarket, there is a need to obtain about 25 licenses and permits. These licenses come with hefty fees, affecting large-scale retailers like OK Zimbabwe and TM Pick n Pay, which have over 50 branches nationwide.\n\nAnother example drawn from the poultry sector players shows huge licenses demanded by the National Biotechnology Authority (NBA) and the Agriculture Marketing Authority (AMA), with the former demanding an annual registration fee of $6,500 per annum despite the fact that they do not provide a service, nor do they inspect the plant.\n\nThe sectors players report that AMA also requires a quarterly registration of imported feed ingredients, which include minerals that are not genetically modified, which carry a yearly cost of $36,400.\n\nAgainst the background, AMA also issues almost similar licenses for Feed Mill Registration, costing $1,000 and plant quarantine, which costs $1,800 per annum, despite the fact that they do not provide any service nor do they inspect the plant. These license fees are over and above normal operating taxes, as well as some fees collected by the local authorities.\n\nResponding to Parliamentarians after a question about what the government is doing to ease the burden of regulatory fees, which, according to the CZI, contribute towards 18% of overhead costs, Ndlovu said such burdens will soon be a thing of the past.\n\nWe identified in our reconstruction and growth plan that the regulatory environment weighs heavily on business viability, and to address it, we have the Minister of Finance working with the Office of the President and Cabinet (OPC) to address this. They have identified most of these licences, fees and other compliance issues that have to be addressed, and shortly, Mr. Speaker, those who followed the Minister of Finance did highlight a few months back that in six months, most of these will be done away with, he said.\n\nThe Minister underscored that it is a thorough process that has to be done with due diligence, with those tasked to address the problems nearing completion.\n\nThey have indicated they are almost complete with that exercise. They will, in the nearest possible future, make announcements of the regulations that are falling away and those that will be significantly slashed to make sure we promote the ease and cost of doing business, he added.\n\n",
