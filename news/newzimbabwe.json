            "content": "By Leopold Munhende\n\nMDC President Douglas Mwonzora has laid into businessman Kudakwashe Tagwirei, describing him as one of the worst politicians who has unsuccessfully attempted to use money to get his way in Zanu PF.\n\nMwonzora was responding to donations and pledges made by Tagwirei in Epworth, where his party candidate Alice Nyahunzvi is set to battle Zanu PFs Civilised Bushe in a Ward 6 by-election on August 2.\n\nTagwirei, who has had quite a difficult month since being asked to leave a Central Committee meeting by Vice President Constantino Chiwengas allies, donated 15 solar-powered boreholes, two graders to rehabilitate the poor neighbourhoods roads, 100 primary school scholarships and 3,000 family food hampers.\n\nHarare province chairman Godwills Masimirembwa had endorsed Tagwirei to join Zanu PFs central committee, two months after the Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) senior member joined active politics.\n\nSpeaking to journalists on Wednesday, Mwonzora said Tagwireis use of money to lure supporters would fail the same way his cars and donations were failing to land him a seat in Zanu PFs powerful committee.\n\nHe said they had told residents of Epworth to eat his money and vote wisely.\n\nIn Epworth, our fight is no longer against the Zanu PF candidate only; it is a fight against thetenderpreneurs, commonly known aszvigananda, who are trying to use the Epworth election as a launchpad to get senior places in Zanu PF, said Mwonzora.\n\nThey are flaunting ill-gotten wealth, churning out false charity. The people of Epworth and Zimbabwe cannot be bought by trinkets.\n\nWe have said to the people of Epworth, eat their money and vote wisely. We are confident that we are going to defeat these bourgeoisie people who are flaunting their wealth.\n\nDespite being a long-time benefactor of the ruling party, Tagwirei has had his efforts to participate in Zanu PF politics resisted by senior members of the party, such as spokesperson Christopher Mutsvangwa and, reportedly, Chiwenga himself.\n\nTagwirei has been touted as Mnangagwas preferred successor ahead of Chiwenga while Mutsvangwa reportedly harbours presidential aspirations too. He has been referred to as the Prime Minister in circles closer to deals struck amongstzvigananda.\n\nAdded Mwonzora: Why was Tagwirei not doing it before? Why is he trying to promise us now?\n\nTagwirei has shown Zimbabwe that he has very bad political table manners. In fact, he is one of the most incompetent politicians I have ever seen.\n\nHe has tried to use money and cars to get into the central committee of his party and he has failed. He will try to use money and wealth in Epworth and he will equally fail.\n\nAccording to Mutsvangwa, Tagwirei promised Zanu PF politburo and central committee members top-of-the-range vehicles for unspecified reasons.\n\nThis, according to the former presidential advisor, was an attempt to bribe, gain favour and influence the decision on his co-option.\n\nZanu PF is targeting 8,000 votes at the Epworth polls, while the MDC believes it can easily upset its monied rivals.\n\n",

            "content": "By Julia Pierini & Kariuki Ndanganga\n\nIn our world of big names, curiously,our true heroes tend to be anonymous,goes a quote by the American historian Daniel Joseph Boorstin. Like these anonymous true heroes, wetlandsplay vital overlooked roles including provision of essential ecosystem services like flood control and water regulation,carbon sequestration, and climate regulation among others. Although they cover about 6% of the earths land surface area, they are home to about 40% of all plants and animal species, including birds which rely on these sites for breeding, feeding and resting during migration.\n\nFurther, these critical ecosystems support livelihoods of billions across the world. However, wetlands are disappearing at an alarming rate, world over. According to the just-released 2025 Global Wetland Outlook (GWO) Report, the world has lost about 22% of these critical ecosystems, equivalent to more than half a billion football pitches, since the 1970s. Various factors including pollution, agricultural and developments in addition to climate change are driving this loss. In the Sahel region, for example, Lake Chad, bordering Chad, Nigeria, Niger, and Cameroon has shrunk from 26,000 square kilometres in the 1960s, to less than 1500 square kilometres today.\n\nIn Zimbabwe, wetlands cover about 3% of the countrys area or about 11, 717 km2. Some key wetlands include Lake Chivero, Victoria Falls, Mana Pools, Cleveland Dam, and Driefontein Grasslands among others. However, more than 70% of these wetlands are degraded, due to various factors including urbanization. agriculture, mining, and pollution.\n\nProtecting and restoring wetlands andsecuring the livelihoods of communities that depend on these areas is paramount. This is why BirdLife International, the worlds largest Nature Partnership, is working in 27 countries across Africa to protect key habitats including wetlands. This approach is underpinned by identifying and protecting wetlands along key migratory bird flyways. Africa is home to key flyways including the African Eurasian Flyway, East Atlantic Flyway, major migration route for waterbirds, encompassing a network of wetlands across countries, which include Ramsar-listed Wetlands of International Importance. Through collaboration with national BirdLife Partners, efforts are focused on implementing national conservation strategies.\n\nAn example of this is in Asias East Asian Australasian Flyway stretching from Siberia and Alaska to New Zealand and Australia. BirdLife in collaboration with the Asian Development Bank and the East Asian Australasian Flyway Partnership Secretariat launched a $3-billion Regional Flyway Initiative in 2021. This initiative aims at the protection and restoration of more than 50 key wetlands sites along the Flyway which are important sites for millions of migratory birds, in addition to supporting livelihoods of millions of people through fisheries and agriculture, among others. Such models can be replicated across flyways, benefitting nature and people. Closer home, BirdLife Zimbabwe is working with local communities to protect the 201,194 hectares Driefontein Grasslands, home to 85% of Zimbabwes Wattled Crane population in addition to significant populations of the Endangered Grey Crowned Crane.\n\nFinancing is yet another critical component of wetlands conservation. According to the GWO Report, it is estimated that biodiversity conservation funding accounts for just 0.25% of global GDP, which is only approximately one-fifth of funds needed to address biodiversity loss, highlighting significant underinvestment. Consequently, there is need to increase investments in nature protection, including wetlands. Luckily, there are several innovative financing tools that can be leveraged. These include debt for nature swaps where debt relief can be provided in exchange for wetlands conservation commitments, green and blue bonds, carbon finance, Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) schemes, and biodiversity credits among others.\n\nPartnerships and collaborations with various stakeholders is paramount for protecting these critical ecosystems. Local communities who are custodians of wetlands, should be empowered to identify and implement relevant solutions to conserve wetlands. Equally important, is the need for policies and regulations which protect wetlands. Like migratory birds, wetlands connect countries, and their conservation necessitates, co-operation across boundaries. From 23rd 31stJuly 2025, the world will convene in Zimbabwe for the Conference on Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar COP 15). This is an opportunity for policymakers to articulate and adopt resolutions to enhance the protection of these delicate ecosystems. Every action counts, and together, let us protect these anonymous heroes for present and future generations.\n\nJulia Pierini is the Chief Executive Officer, BirdLife Zimbabwe. Kariuki Ndangnga is the Regional Director for Africa, BirdLife International.\n\n",

They create this magical, happy energy. Thats what were sharing with the world on August 2.\n\nThe ensemble will feature marimba players aged 8 to 62, drawn from over 70 schools and institutions, representing every province in South Africa, alongside two schools from Zimbabwe. Participants are embarking on significant journeys; one team from KwaZulu-Natal is flying in right after their matric dance, while others are transporting their instruments across provincial lines from Durban and Johannesburg.\n\nIn this record-breaking moment, every marimba counts.\n\nThis is not Marimba Jams first attempt at making history. In 2018, the organisation gathered 241 girls on Womens Day to unofficially break Australias record, yet lacked the resources for official certification. Now, with an international adjudicator flying in from London, their aspiration to etch a new title into the record books is firmly in the spotlight.\n\nThis event is more than just breaking a record, Ramklass said. Its about showing whats possible when we come together across socio-economic divides  private schools, township schools, rural schools  all on one stage. Its a loud, joyful message of ubuntu, the African philosophy that promotes community and shared humanity.Participants will perform a vibrant ten-minute medley of celebrated songs Waka Waka and Jerusalema, both of which serve as powerful anthems of South African pride and unity.\n\nAs the grand event unfolds, a celebratory concert featuring local stars will conclude the day, further cementing the spirit of togetherness.\n\nAttendees can look forward to a plethora of activities beyond the record attempt, including performances by Goodluck, live art installations, interactive marimba demonstrations, djembe drumming workshops, photo booths, and virtual reality experiences. Each participant will also receive an official Guinness World Records medallion in a medal ceremony, celebrating their contribution to this historic event.\n\n",

One resident said that 12 bodies had been found but Barack said no bodies had been recovered.\n\nThe area, in South Kivu province, has been under the control of M23 rebels since they captured swathes of DR Congos mineral-rich east earlier this year. The M23 rejected reports that hundreds were trapped underground.\n\nLomera has witnessed a gold rush since the end of last year when the precious ore was discovered in the hills near what was then a quiet village, according to medical charity MSF.\n\nThousands of people arrived hoping to make money as freelance, or artisanal, miners, turning the area into a sprawling chaos of mineshafts and makeshift shelters, MSF said in a statement on a cholera outbreak in the area last month.\n\nReports said a series of cascading landslides buried up to 15 of these makeshift shafts without warning.\n\nRescue efforts have slowed as debris and large stones continue to block access.\n\nJournalist Barack told the BBC that the lack of proper equipment has hampered attempts to clear the site. Survivors told him that many miners remain stuck.\n\nWeve been digging since Sunday night but have not recovered any bodies. We are exhausted, one miner said.\n\nOfficials from M23 visited the site and ordered mining activities to stop in parts of the area.\n\nDozens of mining sites across this region of DR Congo supply the global electronics industry with vital metals and minerals. Many are not properly regulated and safety standards are not observed.\n\nThe region has also been hit by conflict for decades as various rebel groups and the government have been fighting over control.\n\nThe M23 made significant territorial gains earlier this year, capturing Goma, the main city in eastern DR Congo.\n\nIt signed a ceasefire deal with the government at the weekend in talks brokered by Qatar.\n\n",
