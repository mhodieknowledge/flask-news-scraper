            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nA ZIMBABWEAN businessman has filed a Constitutional Court application seeking a declarator that the judges of the Court of Appeal of Zambia breached that countrys Constitution by failing to abide by the wishes of the Zambian people.\n\nJayesh Shah contends that it is common knowledge that the Constitution of a country is what the people decide how their country should be governed and laws made by Parliament flow from the that supreme law.\n\nShah in 2022, who after 24 years in court, won a US$139 million claim against the Bank of Zambia has now approached the Constitutional Court of Zambia seeking recourse after the Zambian Court of Appeal, in their 15 January 2024 ruling, held that court orders have to be obeyed until that order has been set aside.\n\nHowever, the same court of appeal acted contrary to their own pronouncement of the law as they themselves did not abide by what they held and went ahead to set aside the High Court order which the Bank of Zambia had not appealed against.\n\nThe High Court on September 29, 2022, had ordered Bank of Zambia to pay 30% into court before appealing.\n\nBut the Bank of Zambia, Shah complains breached a court order directing it to pay the 30% into court before appealing.\n\nShah has now petitioned the Constitutional Court of Zambia complaining that the Court of Appeal exceeded its appellant jurisdiction when it entertained an issue which was not appealed against in breach of article 131 of the Constitution and also violates the well- established legal principle of finality to litigation\n\nShah, who has vast business interests in Zimbabwe, Zambia and India among other countries, successfully sued the Zambian Central bank with the judge who presided over the case Justice Edward Luputa Musona describing the back-and-forth applications caused by the Bank of Zambia as an abuse of court processes.\n\nShah and his company AL Shams Building Materials were the applicants in the main matter he won three years ago.\n\nIn the present case at the Constitutional Court, Shah is seeking a declaration that he is also entitled to protection of the law and in addition a declaration that the Zambia Court of Appeal Judges breached the Constitution and went against their oath as judges.\n\nShah also sought a relief of a declaration that the court of appeal breached Article 119 of the Constitution by finding that the Bank of Zambia had disobeyed High Court order, yet the central bank never appealed against that order and went ahead to award costs against Bank of Zambia for disobedience of High Court order.\n\nShah also alleges that the court of appeal breached Article 118 of the Constitution by not acting in a just manner and such actions of the Court of Appeal do not promote accountability as stated in the Constitution.\n\nFinally, Shah alleges that Court of Appeal breached Article 120 of the Constitution as the Court of Appeal did not abide by its own rules which categorically state that they shall only deal with issues which complained and stated in the Memorandum of Appeal.\n\nThe background is that on September 29, 2022, the High Court of Zambia rendered judgment in favour of Shah in sum of US$139,191,386.74 and granted the bank conditional leave to appeal, subject to the deposit of thirty percent (30%) of the judgment sum into the court within the stipulated period within which an appeal was to be lodged.\n\nDespite the condition, the bank proceeded to file a Notice of Appeal and Memorandum of Appeal (with 7 grounds of appeal) on 11th October 2022 before the Court of Appeal of Zambia without complying with the High Courts directive to deposit the required money into court mentioned above, reads his latest petition.\n\nFurthermore, the bank did not, at any point, challenge the legality or propriety of the conditional leave to appeal.\n\nOn October 11, 2022, the bank successfully obtained a stay of proceedings in the High Court Cause No. 2020/HPC/0565 pending the determination of the appeal in the Court of Appeal.\n\nShah maintains that the issues he raises are of public importance and warrant determination by the Constitutional Court pursuant to Article 1(5), which mandates that matters relating to the Constitution be heard by the Constitutional Court.\n\nHe prays for declaratory relief and such other remedies as the Constitutional Court may deem fit in the circumstances.\n\n",
