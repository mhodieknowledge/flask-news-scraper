            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nOne of Zimbabwes largest milling companies, Blue Ribbon Foods, has halted operations at its Bulawayo plant due to an acute shortage of grain.\n\nThe shutdown was confirmed on Monday during a tour of the plant with Blue Ribbon Sales Coordinator for Matabeleland North, Nqabutho Mkhize, revealing that the company ran out of grain in April this year.\n\nGrain Millers Association of Zimbabwe (GMAZ) Southern Region Chairperson David Moyo painted a bleak picture of dwindling local maize supplies.\n\nAt the beginning, we were able to buy from local farmers and the maize was there.\n\nBut now, it is hard to fill a 30-tonne truck. Sometimes you get three or two 50kg bags a day. It takes a week to fill a truck, said Masuka.\n\nIn response to appeals from millers the government recently lifted the ban on maize imports.\n\nHowever, a new statutory instrument introduced to govern imports has created further complications.\n\nThe regulation imposes a levy on the price difference between imported maize (US$300/tonne from South Africa) and the local producer price (US$200/tonne), payable to the Agricultural Marketing Authority (AMA).\n\nMoyo says this measure is making it financially unviable for millers to import the maize they desperately need to keep their plants operational.\n\nThe statutory instrument is unfair and costly. Eventually, the burden will be passed on to the consumer, Moyo said.\n\nWe are simply asking the government to allow millers to import maize freely, without these added levies, as was previously the case.\n\nHe further emphasised that deregulating the maize import framework would allow market forces to determine prices, ultimately lowering the cost of mealie meal for consumers.\n\nThe private sector is here to complement the government. We are partners in ensuring that no Zimbabwean goes hungry in line with the Presidents own promise that no one will be left behind, Moyo said.\n\nThe continued closure of key milling plants like Blue Ribbon in Bulawayo not only threatens food security in urban areas but also risks job losses and rising mealie meal prices at a time when most households are already battling inflation and economic hardship.\n\nMillers are now calling on the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water and Rural Development to urgently review the statutory instrument and allow for flexible, cost-effective maize importation to stabilise the milling industry.\n\n",

The footage clearly shows the accused overseeing the movement of property valued at nearly US$4 million, the court heard.\n\nProsecutors said Chiyani, whose role was to ensure security compliance, failed to provide invoices to justify the movement of the items, while Mhaka allegedly instructed a boilermaker to cut an electric motor and a storage container to make them easier to load.\n\nThe state argued that the pair abused their trusted positions within ZPC.\n\nThis case serves as a clear example of the accountability required of those entrusted with national assets.

Within this group, party leaders (26.1%) and ordinary members (18.3%) were the main actors, the report states.\n\nZPPs July report on human rights violations found that Zanu PF violated the rights of more than 2,200 citizens, with party leaders implicated in 22 per cent of the 10,000 human rights violations recorded across the country.\n\nThe ZPP argues that these violations reveal the deep and often hidden harm inflicted upon individuals and communities.\n\nVictims were subjected to threats of violence, assaults, inhuman treatment and forced displacements, each leaving long-lasting scars on dignity, security, and social cohesion, the report highlights.\n\nThe report points to a worrying pattern of rights abuses by Zanu PF, which has long been labelled a violent party before, during, and after election periods, throughout the year.\n\nOther perpetrators of human rights violations included the government of Zimbabwe, the police, and the military, although these were implicated in fewer incidents in August.\n\nGovernment officials contributed 7%, school authorities 3.1%, religious leaders 1.2%, Citizens Coalition for Change leaders 1.2%, and the Zimbabwe National Army 0.4% were also implicated.

Feed manufacturing registration fees have been cut from US$250 to US$20, and livestock movement clearance fees have been halved from US$10 to US$5 per herd.\n\nOther changes include a reduction of the livestock genetics import permit from US$100 to US$20, and a cut to the meat export registration fee from US$500 to US$100. The food handler certificate fee has been abolished, while Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) costs have been capped at 0.05 percent, with a ceiling of US$100,000.\n\nCZI described the reforms as one of the most significant in recent years. According to the industry body, a total of 96 regulations affecting livestock farming, dairy production, processing, and stockfeed manufacturing were reviewed. Of these, 34 were eliminated, and 40 percent were reduced by at least half.\n\nFor dairy farming, nine regulations were eliminated and seven more were cut significantly. In livestock farming, 45 percent of regulations were scrapped, immediately lifting a huge burden on producers, CZI said.\n\nThe review found that compliance costs in some areas had been reduced by up to 99 percent. The Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA) accounted for the highest number of eliminated regulations at 10, followed by local authorities with eight and the Environmental Management Agency (EMA) with seven. At least 12 high-cost regulationspreviously charging over US$400 eachwere scrapped, while turnover-based levies were capped to avoid penalising larger firms.\n\nRemoving disproportionate charges was critical. The size of a company does not automatically translate into higher enforcement costs, and the new system finally reflects that reality, added CZI.\n\n",
