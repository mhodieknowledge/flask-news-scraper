He reportedly approached a security officer manning the main gate and suddenly attempted to snatch his SKS rifle while shouting, Where is ED? I want to see ED.\n\nA scuffle ensued as the guard wrestled with Ruvheneko before another officer, Private Mupfumira, intervened to subdue him. During the struggle, the accused was injured on his left hand by the bayonet attached to the firearm.\n\nThe accused was arrested while in the process of committing the offence, and there are eyewitnesses who will testify linking him to the crime, the State told the court.\n\nHe was later taken to Five Avenue Police Station, where a report was filed. The State opposed bail, arguing that Ruvheneko has no known address or relatives and may interfere with witnesses if released.\n\n",
