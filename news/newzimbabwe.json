            "content": "By Sports Reporter\n\nNew Warriors coach Marian Marinica began his tenure with a 3-1 defeat to Algeria in an international friendly played at the Prince Abdullah Al-Faisal Stadium in Saudi Arabia.\n\nMarinica fielded a starting eleven that featured several new faces, with Gerald Takwara captaining the side.\n\nAlgeria dominated from the first whistle and needed only 14 minutes to open the scoring through Bagdad Bounedjah, who fired past goalkeeper Washington Arubi.\n\nThe Desert Foxes doubled their advantage in the 40th minute when Mohamed Amoura finished superbly after poor marking by the Zimbabwean defence.\n\nRight on the stroke of halftime, Algerian defender Jaouen Ahjam added a third, again capitalising on Zimbabwes weak defense.\n\nAt the start of the second half, Marinica made four changes, bringing on Prosper Padera, Tawanda Chirewa, Godknows Murwira, and Prince Dube to substitute Bill Antonio, Sean Fusire, Washington Navaya, and Tawanda Maswanhise.\n\nThe substitutions steadied the team, and Zimbabwe began to pose occasional threats going forward.\n\nThe Warriors finally found the net in the 86th minute when Chirewa converted a penalty he had won after being fouled in the box.\n\nDespite the 3-1 defeat, Marinica will take some positives, notably helping Zimbabwe end a four-match goal drought, their last goal having come against Niger in a friendly back in June.\n\nZimbabwe now shifts focus to their next fixture against Qatar on Monday.\n\n",

            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nMovement for Democratic Change (MDC) is in a tense fight for its premises after an activist from the party seized the Morgan Richard Tsvangirai building, popularly known as Harvest House.\n\nThe building, known as Harvest House, was seized by Shakespeare Mukoyi, who serves as the Secretary for Defence, on Wednesday. He claimed to have evicted Douglas Mwonzora, whom he accused of running down the party.\n\nSpeaking after the takeover of the party headquarters, Mukoyi said the once formidable opposition party had fallen under Mwonzoras leadership.\n\nIn the history of the MDC, even in the hostile areas, never had a day it got a zero on a polling station, let alone in a ward. So it gives us a worry as members of the security. Currently, I am holding the position of secretary for defence. It is my obligation and powers invested in my office to make sure that I defend this movement from internal adversaries to external adversaries, said Mukoyi.\n\nThe takeover by Mukoyi is the latest battle for what remains of the MDC, which took a political nosedive after the death of Morgan Tsvangirai in 2018.\n\nSince 2018, the party has been rocked by infighting and splits, weakening a movement that had formidably challenged ZANU PF under Tsvangirai.\n\nThe MDC under Mwonzora took over Harvest House in 2020 from the MDC Alliance, which was then led by Nelson Chamisa, at the height of the partys infighting.\n\nIn a statement, the MDC said the move was an attempt to thwart the partys resistance to ZANU PFs agenda to extend President Emmerson Mnangagwas tenure.\n\nIt has come to the attention of the party leadership that one of our comrades gone rogue, Shaky Mukoyi, has locked the partys head office on the guise of purportedly seeking medical assistance.\n\nIt opened up an opportunity for those who have sold their souls to the regime who are advocating for the 2030 agenda within the party, said MDC.\n\nThe MDC added that it would reclaim the building from the youths.\n\nWe will not give in to extortion and rapacity as the MDC assets belong to bona fide members and under the custodianship of the current leadership under the law.\n\nThuggery and banditry are not an MDC culture and will never be since we have been victims of these since the Mugabe regime.\n\nLastly, let me reassure our members, members of the media, the diaspora, and all those who are concerned that within no time, we are taking our property back.\n\n",
