            "content": "By Xinhua\n\nZIMBABWEAN Defence Minister Oppah Muchinguri-Kashiri has said the country supports the Global Governance Initiative (GGI) proposed by China.\n\nThe GGI reflects Chinas clear assessment and policy response to the current international situation at the political and security level, and it contributes Chinese wisdom and a stabilizing force to resolving international security dilemmas.Muchinguri-Kashiri made the remarks on Friday at a reception held by the Chinese embassy in Harare, the capital of Zimbabwe, ahead of the 76th anniversary of the founding of the Peoples Republic of China, which falls on Oct. 1.We wish to reaffirm our governments support for the recently announced Global Governance Initiative and all the other initiatives spearheaded by China, she said.Muchinguri-Kashiri said relations between Zimbabwe and China have soared, which is evidenced by the elevation of ties to an all-weather community with a shared future during Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwas recent visit to China.The two leaders concurred that the five-star ironclad friendship has steadily deepened and has set an example for solidarity and coordination between China and Africa as well as the Global South, she said.Over the years, the level of economic cooperation between our two countries has soared to greater heights as evidenced by the implementation and commissioning of various programs in the health, energy, agriculture, infrastructure development, and ICT sectors, among others, said Muchinguri-Kashiri.She said the two countries have signed three protocols to facilitate the export of Zimbabwean citrus, avocados, and blueberries to China, and the southern African country is looking forward to more products entering the Chinese market.She also applauded China for providing scholarships to Zimbabwean students and training to professionals, noting that education, scientific and technological development are key drivers to enhance Zimbabwes capabilities in all sectors of the economy.Let us work closely together to further consolidate and drive forward the excellent and mutually beneficial cooperation between our two friendly nations and achieve new milestones in our bilateral relations, Muchinguri-Kashiri added.\n\nThe GGI reflects Chinas clear assessment and policy response to the current international

            "content": "By Mary Taruvinga\n\nThe High Court has cleared the way for Reverend Johannes Nehanda, a senior official in the Apostolic Faith Mission (AFM) in Zimbabwe, to testify in a bitter property dispute linked to the churchs long-running leadership feud.\n\nThe case stems from the deep divisions that split AFM in Zimbabwe in 2018, when rival factions clashed over control of the churchs assets and leadership.\n\nThe dispute spilled into the courts, with competing leaders registering different entities, each claiming to represent the original AFM.\n\nIn the current matter, the AFM is suing Abraham Masamba, Amon Nyika Chinyemba and Odar Housing Development Consortium over control of property, with Nehanda appearing as its representative.\n\nProfessor Lovemore Madhuku representing two AFM pastors argued that because AFM is a universitas  a legal entity without physical existence  Nehanda, as its office bearer, should have testified first.\n\nJustice Christopher Dube-Banda dismissed an objection raised by Madhuku, representing two AFM pastors, who argued that Nehandas testimony was inadmissible because he had sat in court while other witnesses testified.\n\nThe fact that he was not the first to testify and was sitting in court while other witnesses were testifying does not affect the admissibility of his evidence, the judge ruled.\n\nIt is not an issue of admissibility, but of weight.\n\nThe court sided with AFMs counsel, who maintained there is no rule of law that bars a witness who was sitting in court during the testimony of another witness from testifying.\n\nThe judge also cited regional jurisprudence, stressing that similar objections had failed in Zimbabwe, Namibia, Botswana and Zambia.\n\nIt would have been preferable that Rev. Nehanda was to be the first to testify. However such does not debar a witness from testifying, he said.\n\nThe ruling is the latest twist in AFMs protracted legal wars, which have seen congregants, pastors, and church leaders locked in disputes over who controls the churchs lucrative assets.\n\n",
