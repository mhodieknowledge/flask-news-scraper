He is not in the equation or this discourse.\n\nZiyambis comment comes days after Information Minister Jenfan Muswere said the same in a statement released hours after Mnangagwas spokesperson George Charamba shared similar sentiments.\n\nBoth are regarded as Mnangagwa loyalists.\n\nThe politically broad-based call to extend the Presidential term of office beyond 2028 remains a rightful and unquestionable obligation for Parliament, the Party of Zimbabwes permanent national democratic revolution -ZANU PF and other legitimate political stakeholders to this matter, said Muswere in a statement.\n\nThose loyal to Mnangagwas deputy Constantino Chiwenga are reportedly grouping to ensure the formerdoes not extend his term.\n\nHe needs to amend theConstitution twice so as to entertain hopes of hanging on.\n\nCharamba said Mnangagwa as President will not tamper with views expressed by people as that right was enshrined in Zimbabwes constitution.\n\nHis comments came after local daily newspaper NewsDay carried a story on leaders of the Zimbabwe Heads of Christian Denominations (ZHOCD) urging Mnangagwa to respect the 2013 constitution and step aside in 2028 when his second term ends.\n\nThe designated role of the President of Zimbabwe in such situations is not to tamper with expressions of viewpoints from the citizenry; rather, it is to allow those viewpoints free play for as long as they remain within the remit of our Constitution, said Charamba.\n\nMnangagwas home province, Masvingo, was the first to urge him to hang on before other provinces and leagues jumped onto the bandwagon.\n\nDespite distancing himself at the partys last Peoples Conference, Mnangagwas allies have continued to push for the move.\n\n",

That is going to be very important as we move into the future.\n\nI do believe that if we can open up opportunities in these new areas, we create more fans which should in turn bring new revenue opportunities.\n\nMeanwhile, Coventry believes AI could benefit athletes on her home continent by helping them gain better access to training tools, doctors and nutritionists.\n\nAs the only woman in the IOC presidential race, Coventry is keen to support female athletes, particularly around what she describes as sensitive topics.\n\nThe introduction ofa dedicated room for nursing mumsat the most recent Olympics is one particular step which she wants to build on.\n\nThis is a great program, she said.\n\nWere going to help mothers come to the Games, and were going to cover that extra ticket. For me, those are the kinds of programs that help more athletes than just a select few.\n\nYet instances of gender based violence suffered by female athletes, particularly in East Africa, have highlighted a deeper problem.\n\nWorld Athletics hasalready identified campaigning on that issue as a prioritybut Coventry aims to take that further.\n\nIf we have an Olympian thats doing some incredible work on gender based violence, how do we support that? she explained.\n\nIs there a sponsor [or] philanthropist that, as the IOC, we can reach out to and put in touch with that Olympian to amplify what theyre doing  to take their voice, their message, from one community to an entire country, to an entire continent?\n\nThe complicated issue of rules and criteria on transgender athletes would also be high on Coventrys list of priorities.\n\nThe Paris Games were mired in controversy when Algerias Imane Khelifwon womens welterweight boxing golda year after being disqualified from the World Championships for reportedly failing gender eligibility tests.\n\nCoventry, much like fellow IOC presidential candidate Lord Coe, is keen to protect the female category by relying on scientific studies  but the Zimbabwean said the matter would be open to review in the future.\n\nIts our duty to ensure equal opportunity and fairness within our competitions, she said.\n\nI dont believe we can do that based off of the medical and science research that Ive seen if we add or allow for transgender women to compete in the female category right now.\n\nIt is very clear that transgender women are more able in the female category, and can take away opportunities that should be equal for women.\n\nIf that changes and theres new ways of doing things, then well look at that.\n\nMeanwhile, Coventry intends to work with individual international sporting federations to ensure that criteria on transgender athletes are consistent across the board.\n\nCoventry does not believe in offering prize money at the Games, an incentive which was first seen at Paris 2024 when World Athleticsoffered $50,000 to every gold medallist in track and field.\n\nInstead, she argues that funds would be better spent elsewhere as prize money would only benefit top athletes.\n\nWe have 10,500 athletes at the Summer Olympic Games and nearly 3,000 at a Winter Games. How do we impact them? she said.\n\nHow do we ensure that Olympians, or prospective Olympians and athletes from around the world get better access to sport, to training, to health and mental health [support]?\n\nThose are the programs that I would like to focus on.\n\nThe other six candidates for the IOC presidency are Frances David Lappartient, Japans Morinari Watanabe, Prince Feisal al Hussein of Jordan, Spains Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr, Swedens Johan Eliasch and the UKs Lord Sebastian Coe.\n\n",

The owner (of the house) explained that he had kept the bakkie in his yard with permission from the male owner, who had borrowed a large amount of cash and indicated he intended to cross the border to Zimbabwe for spiritual assistance due to issues at his workplace, said Ledwaba.\n\nFurther police investigations revealed that the vehicles owner was accompanied by a man when he dropped off the Ford Ranger on January 17 at around 10pm.\n\nDuring preliminary investigations, police discovered bloodstains inside the vehicle, two empty rifle cartridges, three empty 9mm pistol cartridges, one fragment of 9mm ammunition, six live 9mm rounds, two black 9mm pistol magazines  one with 15 rounds and one empty  and a pair of black gloves, said Ledwaba.\n\nA 24-year-old suspect believed to be involved in the incident was arrested in the early hours of Wednesday at his residence in Tshamutumbu policing area where he was found in possession of two firearms, including a hunting rifle with ammunition, subsequent to an intelligence-driven operation by police in Musina.\n\nAt the time, the vehicles owner and his wife, originally from Mutale in the Vhembe District of Limpopo, were still reported missing.\n\nFurther investigation led to the discovery of the body of the 29-year-old woman, who had multiple gunshot wounds, on Wednesday night, in bushes along the N1 in Kromdraai, in Free State.\n\nPreliminary investigation revealed that the husband, who was supposed to be travelling with the deceased, passed the Verkeerdeveli toll gate alone in the same bakkie on January 17. It was at the turn-off in Kromdraai where the womans body was discovered, said Ledwaba.\n\nMeanwhile, provincial commissioner of police in Limpopo, Lieutenant General Thembi Hadebe, has strongly condemned the senseless shooting that resulted in the tragic death of the woman.\n\nThe South African Police Service is searching for the deceased womans husband, Dakalo Nemangwele, 34, who police believe can assist in their ongoing investigation regarding the murder.\n\nAnyone with information that may assist in tracing the deceaseds husband, should contact Lieutenant Colonel Shuhani Rendani, on cellphone number 082 414 6683, Crime Stop at 08600 1011, or via the MySAPSApp, the police appealed.\n\n",

There are [already] thousands and thousands of local teachers, Kopelo said.\n\nThe groups actions werent xenophobic, Kopelo said, but a plea to the government to prioritize citizens in hiring teachers.\n\nIn other countries  they are being attacked, Kopelo said. Derogatory language is being used against them. We are not moving in that approach; we are fellow brothers and sisters.\n\nIn neighboring South Africa, clashes between migrants and locals have often turned deadly, with citizens arguing foreigners are taking their jobs.\n\nGaborone-based Congolese teacher Patrice Okomi said there is not much foreign workers can do except abide by the host governments regulations.\n\nWe are here at the mercy of the government, and it is entirely up to the Botswana authorities to decide our future, Okomi said. If the feeling is that we have overstayed our welcome, there is not much we can do except to prepare for our exit.\n\nBotswanas stable economy has attracted migrant workers, the majority fleeing hardship in neighboring Zimbabwe.\n\nAccording to figures from the government office Statistics Botswana, there are 4,581 holders of foreign work permits in Botswana, with teachers comprising 18% of the total.\n\n",
