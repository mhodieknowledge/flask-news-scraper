            "content": "By Staff Reporter\n\nTHABANI Mpofu, a top lawyer and confidante of opposition leader Nelson Chamisa, has reacted angrily to a former military commanders declaration from the pulpit that Zanu PF will rule Zimbabwe forever.\n\nThe remarks, made by Anselem Nhamo Sanyatwe, the former Zimbabwe National Army (ZNA) commander and current Minister of Sports, Recreation, Arts and Culture, have ignited a firestorm, with Mpofu calling for a decisive response.\n\nSanyatwe sparked the outrage while addressing congregants at a Seventh Day Adventist (SDA) church in Nyanga North over the weekend.\n\nHe was accompanying his wife, Chido, the local MP, who was receiving a donation of groceries from Kudakwashe Tagwireis Bridging Gaps Foundation.\n\nSanyatwe took the opportunity to assert that Zanu PF will remain in power till the donkeys grow horns, regardless of the electorates wishes.\n\nSanyatwes pronouncements have been met with dismay by many who view them as a blatant disregard for democratic principles and a chilling reminder of the struggle for constitutionalism in Zimbabwe.\n\nHopes for a change of government through the ballot box appear to have been directly undermined by the former military chiefs words.\n\nIt is worth noting that Sanyatwes career trajectory has been subject to intense scrutiny. After serving as ZNA commander for 16 months, President Emmerson Mnangagwa reassigned him to the sports ministry, a move widely interpreted by political analysts as a strategy to shore up his own position amid internal succession battles within Zanu PF.\n\nSanyatwe, once on the U.S sanctions list, is believed to be a close ally of Vice President Rtd General Constantino Chiwenga, himself tipped as a potential successor to Mnangagwa in 2028.\n\nAddressing the SDA congregation, with controversial tycoon Tagwirei also present, Sanyatwe declared the ruling party will retain power forever.\n\nZanu PF ichatonga kusvika madhongi amera nyanga. Ndazvitaura izvozvo nokuti handisisiri muoto. Pane vakambohukura hukura tazvitaura zvekare, ndiri kuzvidzokorora pamberi pekereke kuti uchida usingade tichakutonga kusvika madhongi amera nyanga.\n\nTranslated, this means: Zanu PF will rule till the donkeys grow horns. Im saying this because Im no longer a soldier. We had some people who thought this is a joke when we said it. Now, Im repeating it before the church that whether you like it or not, we will rule over you till the donkeys grow horns.\n\nIn response to the ex-army boss remarks, Mpofu vowed the comments cannot go unchallenged. He questioned the appropriateness of Sanyatwes using a church service to make such a partisan declaration.\n\nSanyatwe goes to my church and in my absence accuses me of kuvukura. Now thats political talk and its totally excusable. Whats not excusable is him saying this on the pulpit, on the sabbath (the holy day of the Lord) and in the presence of my church leaders.\n\nHow does a Zanu PF politician declare during a church service that his party will rule Zimbabwe forever? Mpofu wrote on his X account on Sunday.\n\nThe SDA church has been fully politicised and a line has now been crossed. We must respond decisively to this nonsense.\n\nFormer Binga North MP Prince Dubeko Sibanda echoed this sentiment, stating that Sanyatwe had defiled the church and compromised its neutrality.\n\nSanyatwe is no stranger to controversy. In 2018, he denied military involvement in the fatal shooting of six civilians during post-election protests in Harare. However, the Commission of Inquiry led by former South African President Kgalema Motlanthe established that soldiers were indeed responsible for the deaths of six civilians.\n\nThe army was subsequently sued for its role in the incident. At the time of the shootings, Sanyatwe was the Commander of the Presidential Guard. He was also placed on the U.S sanctions list.\n\nThis latest incident follows a pattern of serving and retired senior military figures openly declaring their allegiance to Zanu PF, and vowing never to salute anyone without liberation war credentials as President of Zimbabwe, further fuelling concerns about the impartiality of the security forces.\n\nIn 2002, months before Zimbabweans headed to the polls for a crucial presidential election, military chiefs delivered a stark warning, drawing a firm line on the qualities they expect in the countrys next leader. The top military brass declared that the presidency is not a prize to be won lightly, but rather a straitjacket whose occupant was expected to observe the objectives of the liberation struggle.\n\nThe message was delivered jointly by the then Defence Forces Chief Vitalis Zvinavashe (now late), Army Commander Constantine Chiwenga (now Vice President), Air Force Chief Perrence Shiri (now late) and Police Commissioner Augustine Chihuri (now retired and in self-exile), has been widely interpreted as a not-so-subtle intervention in the electoral process.\n\nThis was at a time there was heightened political tension between the former and President Robert Mugabe, who faced formidable challenge from the late opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai.\n\nCritics have pointed out that the statement effectively sets a pre-condition for the presidency, one rooted in the historical narrative of the liberation war, thereby potentially disenfranchising voters who may hold differing views or priorities.\n\nThe opposition has condemned the generals remarks as a blatant attempt to intimidate voters and undermine the democratic process.\n\nThe controversy also underscores the enduring influence of the military in Zimbabwean politics.\n\nSenior figures within the ruling Zanu PF party, including current President Emmerson Mnangagwa and party spokesman Christopher Mutsvangwa, have often spoken of an unbreakable bond between Zanu PF and the military. Such pronouncements have led to accusations that elections are a mere ritual, with outcomes preordained due to the militarys allegiance to the ruling party.\n\nSection 208 of the Constitution explicitly forbids members of the security services, regardless of rank, from engaging in active politics.\n\nSanyatwes statement, therefore, raises serious questions about adherence to constitutional principles and the separation of powers in Zimbabwe.\n\n",

            "content": "By UK Correspondent\n\nLabour MP Dawn Butler has withdrawn from an international summit in London after learning she was advertised as a speaker alongsideAuxilliaMnangagwa, Zimbabwes First Lady, who is under US sanctions for alleged corruption and gold smuggling. The decision follows fierce backlash from Zimbabwean activists, who accuse Mnangagwa of hypocrisy and have pledged to disrupt the event with protests.\n\nThe First Ladies of African Impact & Resilience (FLAIR) Summit, due to take place on 17-18 June at the Leonardo Royal Hotelin London, aims to spotlight female leadership and investment in Africa. But Mnangagwas inclusion has ignited controversy, prompting Butlers exit and raising questions about the participation of two other British politicians, Labour MP Diane Abbott and Conservative peer Baroness Sandip Verma.\n\nLabour MP Dawn Butler\n\nIn a statement, Butlers office said: We have never agreed to speaking at this event, so are rightly concerned that Dawn is being advertised as a speaker at this summit. We have contacted the organisers and asked them to remove her name from their programme immediately. The move came after Zimbabwean diaspora activists delivered a petition to 10 Downing Street, calling for Mnangagwa to be barred from the UK.\n\nA Controversial Guest\n\nAuxilliaMnangagwa, married to Zimbabwes President Emmerson Mnangagwa, was sanctioned by the US in 2023 under the Global Magnitsky Act. An Al Jazeera investigation,Gold Mafia, alleged she played a key role in smuggling gold and diamonds, funnelling profits to the ruling elite while Zimbabwes economy crumbled. Over 80% of Zimbabweans are unemployed, and 5.6 million face food insecurity, according to the World Food Programme. Last years elections, widely criticised as fraudulent by the EU, SADCand others, further entrenched the regimes grip on power.\n\nDespite this, Mnangagwa has cast herself as an advocate for womens empowermenta claim activists dismiss as a sham. On 4 June, campaigner JosephineJenje-Mudimbuled a protest outside Downing Street, delivering a petition to block Mnangagwas entry. In a video on X, she said: Charity begins at home.Auxilliashould clean up the mess she and her husband are creating in Zimbabwe. There is no room forAuxilliato come to the UK to present herself at FLAIR.\n\nIve got a message for Auxillia Mnangagwa, the illegitimate First Lady.\n\nThese were the first few words by Josephine Jenje-Mudimbu as she started. She was standing in front of 10 Downing Street in London, on the 4th of June 2025 as part of a protest that was also handing in apic.twitter.com/SbPCPvghXA\n\n Zimbabwe Freedom of Expression (@ZimbabweFreedo1)June 12, 2025\n\nThe outrage has spilled onto social media. X user @MilMillazwrote: AuxilliaMnangagwa must not be given a platform at the #FLAIRSummit. She represents a brutal regime responsible for abductions, mass corruption, and human rights abuses.\n\nPolitical Fallout\n\nButlers withdrawal has turned the spotlight on Abbott and Verma, both still listed as speakers. Abbott, a veteran Labour MP, and Verma, the UKs Ministerial Champion for Tackling Violence Against Women and Girls Overseas, have yet to clarify their stances. For Verma, the stakes are high: her role puts her at odds with sharing a stage with the spouse of a leader linked to state violence. Neither responded to inquiriesemailed to their offices last week.\n\nThe silence has fuelled criticism. Would these MPs sit with the spouse of a Russian oligarch? asked @ChirevoChamisaon X. If not, what makes Zimbabwe different? Activists argue that hosting Mnangagwa undermines the summits stated mission and sends a dangerous signal to Zimbabwean women enduring repression.\n\nThe FLAIR Summits organisers have remained tight-lipped, though sources suggest Mnangagwas participation could be reconsidered as protests mount. With just days until the event, the row exposes a broader dilemma: how to balance diplomatic engagement with accountability for human rights abuses.\n\nAs activists prepare to shut it down, the summits future hangs in the balance.\n\n",

            "content": "By Humeyra Pamuk I Reuters\n\nU.S. President Donald Trumps administration is considering significantly expanding its travel restrictions by potentially banning citizens of 36 additional countries from entering the United States, according to an internal State Department cable seen by Reuters.\n\nEarlier this month, the Republican president signed a proclamation that banned the entry of citizens from 12 countries, saying the move was needed to protect the United States against foreign terrorists and other national security threats.The directive was part of an immigration crackdown Trump launched this year at the start of his second term, which has included the deportation to El Salvador of hundreds of Venezuelans suspected of being gang members, as well as efforts to deny enrollments of some foreign students from U.S. universities and deport others.In an internal diplomatic cable signed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the State Department outlined a dozen concerns about the countries in question and sought corrective action.The Department has identified 36 countries of concern that might be recommended for full or partial suspension of entry if they do not meet established benchmarks and requirements within 60 days, the cable sent out over the weekend said.The cable was first reported by the Washington Post.Among the concerns the State Department raised was the lack of a competent or cooperative government by some of the countries mentioned to produce reliable identity documents, the cable said.Another was questionable security of that countrys passport.Some countries, the cable said, were not cooperative in facilitating the removal of its nationals from the United States who were ordered to be removed. Some countries were overstaying the U.S. visas their citizens were being granted.Other reasons for concern were the nationals of the country were involved in acts of terrorism in the United States, or antisemitic and anti-American activity.The cable noted that not all of these concerns pertained to every country listed.We are constantly reevaluating policies to ensure the safety of Americans and that foreign nationals follow our laws, a senior State Department official said, declining to comment on specific internal deliberations and communications.The Department of State is committed to protecting our nation and its citizens by upholding the highest standards of national security and public safety through our visa process, the official said.The countries that could face a full or a partial ban if they do not address these concerns within the next 60 days are: Angola, Antigua and Barbuda, Benin, Bhutan, Burkina Faso, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cote DIvoire, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Dominica, Ethiopia, Egypt, Gabon, The Gambia, Ghana, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Malawi, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, South Sudan, Syria, Tanzania, Tonga, Tuvalu, Uganda, Vanuatu, Zambia, and Zimbabwe.That would be a significant expansion of the ban that came into effect earlier this month. The countries affected were Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, Congo Republic, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen.The entry of people from seven other countries  Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan and Venezuela  has also been partially restricted.During his first in office, Trump announced a ban on travelers from seven Muslim-majority nations, a policy that went through several iterations before it was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018.Reporting by Humeyra Pamuk Editing by Bill Berkrot.\n\nEarlier this month, the Republican president signed a proclamation that banned the entry of citizens from 12 countries, saying the move was needed to protect the United States against foreign terrorists and other national security threats.\n\nThe directive was part of an immigration crackdown Trump launched this year at the start of his second term, which has included the deportation to El Salvador of hundreds of Venezuelans suspected of being gang members, as well as efforts to deny enrollments of some foreign students from U.S. universities and deport others.In an internal diplomatic cable signed by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, the State Department outlined a dozen concerns about the countries in question and sought corrective action.The Department has identified 36 countries of concern that might be recommended for full or partial suspension of entry if they do not meet established benchmarks and requirements within 60 days, the cable sent out over the weekend said.The cable was first reported by the Washington Post.Among the concerns the State Department raised was the lack of a competent or cooperative government by some of the countries mentioned to produce reliable identity documents, the cable said.Another was questionable security of that countrys passport.Some countries, the cable said, were not cooperative in facilitating the removal of its nationals from the United States who were ordered to be removed.
