And fatigue has set in among humanitarian donors.\n\nThat leaves multilateral lenders and development finance institutions as the countrys best hope for feeding roughly half its population. Yet unlike other countries including neighboring Zambia, which has already received $1 billionfrom the World Bankand the International Monetary Fund to replenish its food supplies and hydropower-dependent energy system Zimbabwe is locked out of adding to its debt.\n\nZimbabwes creditors include the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank and the Paris Club, all of which have declined to provide emergency funds. The IMF said it is bound by rules that preclude it from making loans to a country already in default to related organizations.\n\n",

            "content": "By Thandiwe Garusa\n\nTHE temporary closure of truck-stop clinics across Zimbabwe, following a recent cessation of USAID funding has raised alarm over a potential surge in HIV cases among high-risk populations, particularly long-distance truck drivers and sex workers.\n\nThese clinics have played a vital role in providing HIV prevention, testing, and treatment services in border towns and high-traffic areas.\n\nHowever, they have been temporarily closed due to the implementation of U.S. President Donald Trumps America First policy.\n\nSpeaking in a parliamentary session Tuesday, Member of Parliament for Hwange West Vusumuzi Moyo urged the Ministry of Health to take immediate action and look for alternative funding sources to ensure vulnerable communities continue to receive the necessary support in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n\nWithout funding for laboratory tests, HIV counselling and antiretroviral medications, many truck drivers and sex workers who rely on these clinics may not have access to crucial HIV-related healthcare services. In turn, this could result in an increase in undiagnosed HIV cases and the lack of consistency of the ART adherence, both of which contribute to higher transmission rates, he said.\n\nWith funding cuts, the sustainability of these services is at risk and the impact could be felt in high HIV prevalence, decreased access to care and return to higher transmission rates.\n\nTo mitigate these effects, it is essential to explore and implore the Ministry of Health to seek alternative funding models and to strengthen our local healthcare system to ensure that the vulnerable population continues to receive the support they need in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n\nMeanwhile, Population Solutions for Health (PSH) New Start Centres have temporarily halted services for patients on ART and those seeking PrEP refills.\n\nApproximately 1.2 million Zimbabweans benefit from the U.S Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), and over 1,600 public hospitals and clinics have received training and technical support from the US government.\n\n",

They accuse the Zanu-PF leader of overseeing rampant corruption and nepotism, and of plotting to extend his term beyond the constitutionally mandated limit.\n\nGeza also turned his fire on the First Lady, Auxilia Mnangagwa, accusing her of wasting state resources on what he deems unnecessary tours around the country.\n\nConstitutional experts such as Professor Lovemore Madhuku have long maintained that such a term extension is legally impossible.\n\nWhile Mnangagwa himself has publicly pledged to step down at the end of his term in 2028, critics warn that this is simply his modus operandi  giving the impression of heading one way while veering sharply in another.\n\nThey point to his continued silence on the matter, failing to quash those who advocate for a term extension, as further evidence.\n\nMnangagwas term concludes in 2028, yet some of his allies and party members persist in calling for him to remain in power until 2030.\n\nGeza, a Zanu-PF Central Committee member, delivered his most recent press conference on Monday, urging Zimbabweans to prepare for a national shutdown as calls for Mnangagwas resignation grow louder, the tide is turning with the public.\n\nWe implore you to resign peacefully. If you dont resign in peace, people will use the constitution to exercise their right to push you out of office, Geza said.\n\nGeza also warned the police that if they dared to beat or shoot demonstrators protesting against Mnangagwa, the public would hold them accountable in their own neighbourhoods.\n\nIn response, police spokesperson Commissioner Paul Nyathi issued a statement on Wednesday, asserting that Geza faces charges of insulting Mnangagwa and inciting public violence.\n\nTheft allegations as defined in Section 113 of the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act, Chapter 9: 23. The suspect stole and disposed of three vehicles belonging to a complainant without his consent.\n\nHe is also facing two counts of contravening Section 33 (2) (a) (ii) of the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act, Chapter 9: 23, Undermining the Authority of or insulting the President,' Nyathis statement reads.\n\nCommissioner Nyathi further stated that Geza had incited the public to commit violence, violating the Criminal Code and Reform Act.\n\nOne count of contravening Section 187 of the Criminal Law Codification and Reform Act, Chapter 9:23, Incitement to commit public violence, Nyathi said.\n\nNyathi also cautioned that anyone found harbouring Geza or assisting him in evading police questioning would be equally liable for arrest and prosecution.\n\n",

So now we cannot go in because of church? We are within!\n\nThe idea of exposing pastors  trusted figures in religious communities  has sparked mixed reactions.\n\nFor those who might be unfamiliar with the show, Uyajola 9/9 is South Africas answer to the Cheaters franchise, with a distinctly local twist.\n\nIn each episode, Jub Jub and his team track down people suspected of cheating, confronting them with evidence.\n\nThe show has become known for its intense confrontations, high drama, and unpredictable outcomes, sometimes tearing families apart, other times resolving long-standing issues.\n\nNow, it seems the show is turning a critical eye toward the very institutions that are meant to guide and support moral values  churches.\n\nBy targeting pastors and religious figures, Jub Jub is challenging the belief that these spaces are beyond reproach when it comes tocheating.\n\nThe implications of exposing cheating in religious settings are complex. On one hand, its understandable why some viewers might see this as a necessary step towards transparency.\n\nIf pastors, who are often viewed as role models are coveting with thy neighbour, it raises concerns about their integrity and teachings.\n\nFor those in the congregation, the revelation could be a shock but also a wake-up call about the flaws that exist even in the most revered of spaces.\n\nHowever, theres also a more sensitive side to consider.\n\nThe church is often considered a sanctuary for people to find solace, guidance and community. By airing these personal conflicts on national TV, Uyajola 9/9 might risk eroding the trust people place in their religious leaders.\n\nSome viewers may feel that the show is exploiting sacred spaces for entertainment rather than truly serving the greater good.\n\nUyajola 9/9 is stirring up an important conversation  one about loyalty, accountability and the blurred lines between public and private life.\n\nShould religious leaders be held to a higher standard? Is it right to expose personal matters in such a public way? Or is this a wake-up call that theres no one immune to the temptations of infidelity, even in the holiest of spaces?\n\nSo many questions!\n\nJub Jub says he is also coming for cheating pastors in the next season of Uyajola99.pic.twitter.com/kyUbDcCFcr\n\n@nathit00th commented: Chief we are busy dealing with bigger issues in our country at the moment. we are repositioning south africa in the world and wena you are coming with petty issues of cheaters please dude chill. we will give you attention next year.\n\n@ModiegiLakes commented: They really need to just shut it. No longer relevant this uyajola 99 nonsense.\n\nWhile @r_motlatso wrote: Hes lying, last time he was promoting season 2 of this stupid show, he said hell be exposing celebrities who cheat.

            "content": "BBC\n\nThe Rwandan-backed M23 rebels have attacked Congolese government forces in the South Kivu province, breaking a two-day lull in fighting.\n\nHeavy shelling began on Tuesday morning, three days after a summit of East and Southern African leaders called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire.\n\nThe rebels have seized vast swathes of land in the eastern DR Congo, including the major city of Goma.\n\nThey are now pushing towards Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu  another key city in the region.\n\nAround 2,900 people have been killed since early January as a result of the hostilities, the latest UN figures suggest.\n\nApproximately 700,000 others are estimated to have been forced from their homes and thousands more injured.\n\nTuesdays fighting erupted near Ihusi, a locality around 70km (43 miles) from Bukavu and 40km from the South Kivus airport, security sources told news agency AFP.\n\nA spokesperson for the Congo River Alliance (known by its French acronym AFC), an alliance of rebel groups including the M23, suggested its fighters could take their battle to Bukavu.\n\nLawrence Kanyuka responded to the arrests by the Congolese authorities of 84 army personnel for crimes such as killing civilians near Bukavu, saying: If these crimes persist, we will take full responsibility to eradicate the threat at its source and protect our people.\n\nMeanwhile, reports say that hundreds and thousands of refugees, who have fled the ongoing fighting, were being forced to return home by the M23.\n\nThe M23 has denied this allegation, but French broadcaster RFI reported that several large camps for displaced people have been dismantled and their inhabitants made to trek back to their villages in conflict zones.\n\nOcha, the UNs humanitarian agency, said the M23 had given displaced people in Goma 72 hours to return to home.\n\nMr Kanyuka said such reports were propaganda and that displaced people were returning voluntarily. The M23 does not compel anyone to return without firm security guarantees, he said.\n\nThe M23, which is made up of ethnic Tutsis, say they are fighting for minority rights, while DR Congos government says the rebels are seeking control of the eastern regions vast mineral wealth.\n\nDR Congo and the UN accused Rwandas Tutsi-dominated government of backing the M23  an allegation which Kigali has persistently denied.\n\nBut recently, the official response has shifted, with government spokespeople stating that fighting near its border is a security threat.\n\n",
