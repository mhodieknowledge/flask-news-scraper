            "content": "By Darlington Gatsi\n\nLocal Government Minister Daniel Garwe has insisted that the Civil Protection Department responded well and swiftly to the Seke Road accident that claimed 17 lives, despite criticism over the slow emergency response.\n\nSeventeen people died when a haulage truck veered off the road, swerving into the opposite lane and colliding with an oncoming minibus along Seke Road last week.\n\nThe accident exposed the governments weak emergency response mechanisms, with eyewitnesses reporting that many victims died on the accident scene due to the absence of a rescue crane.\n\nResponding to questions in the National Assembly recently, Minister of Local Government and Public Works, Daniel Garwe, defended the governments handling of the tragedy.\n\nThe issue of responsiveness in terms of time taken is subject to the time that the accident is reported to the responsible authority, in this case, the Civil Protection Department.\n\nWe cannot say the Ministry failed to respond timeously. It depends on the time when the incident was reported. I will have to find out the time that was taken to receive the response and the time we went to the site, said Garwe.\n\nHe added:The issue of having cranes on site also depends on how the accident was reported. Maybe people just reported that there was an accident along the Chitungwiza Road at a river bridge without giving the intimate details of how the accident was reported.\n\nSo, we cannot answer that in that regard, it is very difficult, but from the Civil Protection Department side, the Government is doing extremely well. We responded swiftly.\n\nFollowing the horrific crash, the government faced criticism from observers and opposition figures, including Nelson Chamisa, over its lack of preparedness for emergencies.\n\nHowever, Garwe shifted blame onto the Chitungwiza Municipality, accusing it of a delayed response despite being equipped to handle such situations.\n\nAt the Chitungwiza Road accident, the Department of Civil Protection was there first before everybody else and the fire tenders which came from Harare, were also activated by that department.\n\nMadam Speaker, you may want to know that the Government has capacitated all 92 local authorities with firefighting equipment to use in situations such as what happened last week on Friday in Chitungwiza, where a road traffic accident cost the lives of 17 of our citizens.\n\nAll local authorities in the urban areas were equipped with at least two fire tenders each and we wanted to sit down and ask the local authority responsible in Chitungwiza why its reaction was so slow and to ask the city council to come and assist, he said.\n\n",

Ms Pierce toldMIT Technology Reviewher family thought its like something from a sci-fi movie.\n\nIt is believed to be longest that an embryo has been frozen before resulting in a successful live birth. The previous record-holder wasa pair of twins who were born in 2022 from embryos frozen in 1992.\n\nThe Pierces had tried to have a child for seven years before they decided to adopt the embryo Linda Archerd, 62, made with her then-husband in 1994 through IVF.\n\nAt the time, Ms Archerd initially created four embryos. One become her now-30-year-old daughter, and the other three were left in storage.\n\nDespite separating from her husband, she did not want to get rid of the embryos, donate them for research or give them to another family anonymously.\n\nShe said it was important that she was involved with the baby, as they would be related to her adult daughter.\n\nMs Archerd paid thousands of dollars a year for storage until she found a Christian embryo adoption agency, Nightlight Christian Adoptions, which runs a programme known as Snowflakes. Many of these agencies consider their programmes to be saving lives.\n\nThe programme used by Ms Archerd allows donors to choose a couple, meaning they can state religious, racial and nationality preferences.\n\nMs Archerds preference was for a married Caucasian, Christian couple living in the US, as she didnt want to go out of the country, she told MIT Technology Review.\n\nShe ultimately matched with the Pierces.\n\nThe IVF clinic in Tennessee at which the couple underwent the procedure, Rejoice Fertility, said its aim was to transfer any embryo it received, no matter the age or conditions.\n\nMs Pierce said she and her husband did not set out to break any records, but just wanted to have a baby.\n\nMs Archerd told MIT Technology Review she had not met the baby in person yet, but could already see a resemblance with her daughter.\n\n",

The capital deployment to the portfolio companies is guided by the Investment Strategy of the Fund and the diagnostic assessment report, prioritising long-term value creation, stability and prosperity, Ncube said.\n\nInvestments currently under consideration include procurement of buses for the Zimbabwe United Passenger Company (ZUPCO) to minimise public transport challenges, capitalisation of the National Railways of Zimbabwe (NRZ) to rehabilitate rail infrastructure and address rolling stock challenges, crafting of sustainable operational models for COTTCO, Air Zimbabwe, Cold Storage Company and Silo Food industries, among others.\n\nThe Fund is also working with the Zimbabwe Electricity Supply Authority (ZESA) on a variety of initiatives to address power shortages, which include enhancing base load, together with the implementation of prepaid, net and smart metering projects.\n\nBased on the current and projected investments in the energy sector, the Fund is optimistic that load shedding will be significantly minimised in the outlook period, not least because of the rehabilitation of Hwange Units 1 to 6 under a Rehabilitate Operate and Transfer concession agreement between Zimbabwe Power Company and Jindal Africa, added Ncube.\n\n",

            "content": "By Alois Vinga\n\nDespite the fact that just 35% of the 2025 National Budget allotted funds were spent six months into the year, Finance Minister Mthuli Ncube declared a ZWG3.3 billion budget surplus in theMid-Term Budget Review Statement.\n\nPresenting the much-awaited Mid-Term Budget Review Statement, Thursday themed,Building Resilience for Sustained Economic Transformation, the Treasury boss confirmed earlier speculation that much of the allotted resources are rarely disbursed efficiently\n\nFiscal outlays for the period January to June 2025 amounted to ZWG98 billion, which is approximately 35.5% of the approved Budget. Recurrent expenditures were ZWG74.4 billion, while financial and non-financial assets (capital expenditure and net lending) amounted to ZWG23.6 billion, he said.\n\nOf this amount, more than half with ZWG45.4 billion, went towards employment costs and operations ZWG18.8 billion, interest payments paltry at ZWG2.5 billion and capital expenditure, including devolution, amounted to ZWG23.6 billion, leaving very few resources for capital expenditure.\n\nHowever, speaking to the media shortly after the budget presentation, Ncube defended the 35% expenditure to slower drawdowns by Ministries in the first quarter of the year.\n\nMinistries often take time to put their papers in order and we often experience limited revenue inflows during the first parts of the year which partly explains the expenditure patterns. However, we are currently working on improving ways in which expenditures can improve, he said.\n\nNcube said during the years first half, Treasury mobilised resources for budget financing totalling ZWG1.3 billion, including US$90 million Treasury Bills, through the issuance of domestic securities.\n\nIn US dollar terms, the fiscal framework translates to revenues of US$7.5 billion and expenditures of US$7,7 billion, as well as a budget deficit of US$168.4 million.\n\nHe said during the first half of the year 2025, both inflation and exchange rate were relatively stable than envisaged. The budget has, therefore, been performing below target in local currency terms, although performance was significantly above target in foreign currency terms.\n\nRevenue collections during the period amounted to ZWG101.2 billion against a target of ZWG118.1 billion, whilst expenditures were ZiG98 billion against a target of ZWG127.5 billion.\n\nOn a cash accounting basis, a budget surplus of ZWG3.3 billion was recorded during the first six months of the year.\n\nNcube added that drastic reforms aimed at improving the ease of doing business and the eradication of multiple licensing fees would be aggressively implemented in the second half.\n\n",
