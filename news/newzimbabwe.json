            "content": "By Bang Showbiz\n\nRAPPER Nicki Minaj has been accused of hitting and berating her former tour manager, Brandon Garrett, who has filed a lawsuits against her in Los Angeles Superior Court, in which he also alleged she subjected him to the intentional infliction of emotional distress during her Pink Friday 2 tour last year.\n\nAccording to documents obtained by TMZ and Variety, the lawsuit stems from an alleged incident after Minajs show at Detroits Little Caesars Arena on April 21, 2025.Brandons lawyers claim he received a text from the Starships hitmakers head of security, Larry Dathan, asking him to speak with the 42-year-old singer in her dressing room when he was on his way to the arena.When he got there, the manager alleged around eight other staff members were there, and Minaj  who has a four-year-old son with husband Kenneth Petty  began complaining that some didnt know what they are supposed to do, and who reports to who before asking a man named Luke Montgomery his purpose on the tour.The documents added: Mr. Montgomery explained that his duties entailed tasks like venue dressing room set-up, private jet set-up, hotel room set-up, quick change room refreshments and tour bus set-up.Mr. Montgomery mentioned these duties were in addition to any requests from Minaj communicated by Garrett, including food orders, drinks, personal items, baby items, and, most notably, prescriptions.Brandon explained he told his famous boss he had asked his colleague to collect prescriptions because he was busy with tour responsibilities, including assisting Minaj with her costume changes, but he alleged the star then became visibly upset and angrily screamed at him.She allegedly fumed: Are you f****** crazy having him pick up my prescription? You have lost your f****** mind and if my husband were here, he would knock out your f****** teeth. Youre a dead man walking. You just f****** up your whole life, and you will never be anyone, Ill make sure of it.She is then accused of yelling at Luke and demanding he look through his phone to find out which medications he had picked up from her, before turning her attention back to Brandon and allegedly getting very close to his face.The complaint added: At this point, Minaj open-handedly struck Garrett on the right side of his face, causing his head to swing backwards as his hat flew off his head.The tour manager  who allegedly was also left with a throbbing right wrist after being stuck on the arm  then locked himself in a bathroom for several hours and received a text message telling him he wasnt being asked to join the next stop on the tour.The complaint states, per Variety. Attorneys for Garrett also state that he was hit in his right wrist, leaving it throbbing.Brandon eventually filed a complaint with Detroit police and is seeking punitive and exemplary damages as well as general damages.Nickis lawyer has branded the lawsuit frivolous and denied the allegations, but stressed she hadnt yet received the complaint.Judd Burstein told TMZ: At this time, no complaint has been served upon Minaj, and therefore, we are unaware of the specific allegations.However, if the lawsuit is as reported by TMZ, it is completely false and frivolous. We are confident that the matter brought by this ex-assistant will be resolved swiftly in Mrs. Pettys favour.\n\nAccording to documents obtained by TMZ and Variety, the lawsuit stems from an alleged incident after Minajs show at Detroits Little Caesars Arena on April 21, 2025.\n\nBrandons lawyers claim he received a text from the Starships hitmakers head of security, Larry Dathan, asking him to speak with the 42-year-old singer in her dressing room when he was on his way to the arena.When he got there, the manager alleged around eight other staff members were there, and Minaj  who has a four-year-old son with husband Kenneth Petty  began complaining that some didnt know what they are supposed to do, and who reports to who before asking a man named Luke Montgomery his purpose on the tour.The documents added: Mr. Montgomery explained that his duties entailed tasks like venue dressing room set-up, private jet set-up, hotel room set-up, quick change room refreshments and tour bus set-up.Mr. Montgomery mentioned these duties were in addition to any requests from Minaj communicated by Garrett, including food orders, drinks, personal items, baby items, and, most notably, prescriptions.Brandon explained he told his famous boss he had asked his colleague to collect prescriptions because he was busy with tour responsibilities, including assisting Minaj with her costume changes, but he alleged the star then became visibly upset and angrily screamed at him.She allegedly fumed: Are you f****** crazy having him pick up my prescription?

I agree it needs a major upgrade and think this should be a priority over, for example, the new stadium in Victoria Falls, said Coltart.\n\nThe countrys largest football stadium, the 60 000-seater National Sports Stadium (NSS) located in Harare, which has not been used for hosting football games for almost three years, was also banned by FIFA and CAF.\n\n",

            "content": "By Anna Chibamu\n\nVULNERABLE groups such as women, girls and those with disability are being abused in so many ways in mining communities they live and or work, a local Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) has said.\n\nMargaret Chogugudza of Rural Young Women Support Network (RYWSN) said several challenges were being faced, which require urgent amendment of the mining legislation.\n\nOne of the major challenges is violence against women and girls. Given the fact that they are more vulnerable to violence because of their gender, this is something that is critical and that needs to be addressed, Chogugudza said.\n\nChogugudza made the revelation during an interview with NewZimbabwe.com after attending a Mines and Mining Development Parliamentary Committee oral evidence hearing on the ministrys interventions on empowering these marginalized groups in the mining sector.\n\nShe illustrated that this was one reason why women were not keen to participate in mining activities  for example, extreme violence by the so-called machete gangs.\n\nEven If you look at our politics in Zimbabwe, you will also see a few women participating because of the nature of the environment which is hostile/ violent.\n\nWomen face a lot of physical, emotional and sexual abuse. They get abused, sometimes drugged so that they can be managed easily. They can be forced into sexual activities whilst drunk without consent leading to unwanted pregnancies or being exposed to sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n\nIn Mutoko, where granite is being mined, women have spoken about sexual abuse as one of the most disturbing issues affecting them, said Chogugudza.\n\nAnother major challenge has been limited access to finance and the health and safety risks.\n\nThe equipment they use is not safe whilst the effects of the mining activities in the communities themselves are harmful to their health; such cases where chemicals are used.\n\nShe said water is not always readily available in these communities and this increases the burden of women and girls in terms of unpaid care work-fetching water.\n\nChogugudza also talked about mining sector being stereotyped to be a male-dominated sector to the extent that even in the Mines and Mineral Act itself, it is actually silent regarding women issues.\n\nShe highlighted that most women and girls implicated State security actors as other culprits violating women and girls rights in mining communities.\n\nA lot of the women have pointed out violence, even from the security State actors. When running away from protected areas, be it police, the military, girls are mostly victims of violence or sexual abuse.\n\nAlso, issues of corporate social responsibility from mining companies. These were not talked about often by the women.\n\nRepresentation of women during meetings on potential projects needed by communities and is very limited.\n\nAt the end of the day, the decisions that are made do not speak to the needs of of women and girls.\n\nSo, there is a limited voice of women and girls in terms of what they need, and what the mining activities should be like, e g. If you talk of macro level mining, without them participating in those processes.\n\nThere are hindrances in partnering with big companies, even in cases where there is a bit of partnership, the working conditions are not good for the women and girls, worse still those living with disabilities, she explained.\n\nEven access to health care services, in relation to the community challenges is said to be critical and yet access to education is also very critical, especially considering displacements that are taking place countrywide.\n\nChogugudza revealed that the government was not doing enough at this juncture in as much as there have been some strides.\n\nGovernment intervention is still limited due to several reasons, chief amongst them legislation and lack of resources.\n\nThe Mines and Minerals Act was put into place in1960 to 1963, and you can see a lot of changes that have taken place in the extractive sector over time.\n\nWe are talking of decades, and things have changed so the Act is not responding to the needs of this generation, to the needs of the nation and the current situation, she stated.\n\nIn terms of chaos, fights and violence in foreign based mining areas (where foreign companies are located) there have been a lot of reported cases of human rights violations against mining workers in general.\n\nAs an organisation, we have been working on documenting the challenges that young women are facing in the mining communities. One of the challenges has been to engage with foreign mining companies.\n\nThe challenge that you always face is to engage with these mining companies, you rarely see them.\n\nThere is also not really transparency and accountability in terms of what exactly is happening.\n\nShe questioned how much communities were getting and the sum the companies were leaving for the country and how much they were channelling towards corporate social responsibilities.\n\nThat is critical. When the Mines and Minerals Act is amended, issues of transparency and accountability, community engagement, the communities have a right to hold mining companies to account through their leaders, she told this publication.\n\n",

However, a rise in unemployment for South African citizens has pushed its government to terminate the service.\n\nCurrently, if an undocumented migrant is arrested in South Africa, he or she is sentenced to six months in prison or by luck and chance deported back to his nation.\n\n",

So, it is illogical and quite incomprehensible that you would be disqualified for holding a higher qualification than the minimum required, said Ongwe.\n\nSo, on the basis of that, we have, in keeping with the provisions of the ZIFA statutes, lodged our appeal with the Court for Arbitration for Sports as mandated by the ZIFA statutes. That is the first issue.\n\nThe second issue: The ZIFA Normalization Committee has gone about normalizing ZIFA in an abnormal manner in the sense that as a precursor to the electoral processes that are currently afoot, there was a constitutional amendment process, constitutional making process that was championed by the Normalization Committee and which paid the dictates of the mandate given to the Normalization Committee by FIFA was to be ratified by ZIFA at congress, Ongwe said.\n\nRegarding the convening of a congress, Ongwe said, The congress was convened. I say convened in court on October 18th, 2024, and there it presided over the business of ZIFA and amongst other things it resolved to adopt the draft amended ZIFA statutes which were subsequently placed before the Sports and Recreation Commission and adopted by the Sports and Recreation Commission and which is the basis upon which the current electoral process is currently being carried out.\n\nAccording to him, a crisis arose.\n\nThe congress of ZIFA can only lawfully make decisions, can only lawfully make resolutions if properly constituted. The delegates that sat on the 18th of October 2024 do not carry the mandate to carry out any football business on behalf of ZIFA.\n\nAll the ZIFA councillors that were present and voting on the day had their terms of office expire as far back as October 2022. So, from October 2022, none of those ZIFA councillors have carried a lawful mandate to transact any ZIFA business.\n\nSo, it follows if the persons that sat and determined and adopted the current ZIFA statute in 2024 had no mandate to do so then it follows that that whole process is marred in irregularity and if that process is marred in irregularity the fruit of a poisonous tree cannot be anything other than poison, the lawyer explained.\n\nHe stated that what has followed pursuant to that constitution making process is marred in illegality.\n\nSo on the basis of the unprocedural process that was carried out in the constituent making process and on the basis of the unprocedural processes that subsequently followed such as the electoral process that is currently underway, we have decided to take that matter up with our courts of law on review to determine whether or not the Constitution of ZIFA 2024 that is the ZIFA statutes 2024 on the basis of which the current electoral processes are being carried out was lawfully promulgated and lawfully brought into force. We beg to differ on that aspect.\n\n",
