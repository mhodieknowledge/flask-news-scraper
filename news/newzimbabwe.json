            "content": "By Pan Pylas l Associated Press\n\nLONDON: The British government will roll out the use of medication to suppress the sex drive of sex offenders, as part of a package of measures to reduce the risk of reoffending and alleviate the pressures on the prison system, which is running out of space.\n\nJustice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said Thursday that so-called chemical castration would be used in 20 prisons in two regions and that she was considering making it mandatory.Of course, it is vital that this approach is taken alongside psychological interventions that target other causes of offending, like asserting power and control, she said in a statement to Parliament following the release of an independent sentencing review.Though the review highlighted the treatment wouldnt be relevant for some sex offenders such as rapists driven by power and control, rather than sexual preoccupation, Mahmood said that studies show that chemical castration can lead to a 60% reduction in reoffending.Its been used in Germany and Denmark on a voluntary basis, and in Poland as mandatory for some offenders.The recommendation was part of a wide-ranging review led by former Justice Secretary David Gauke. As well as looking at ways to cut reoffending, Gauke recommended reforms to overhaul the prisons system, which is running at near capacity.One of the first things Mahmood did as justice minister after Labour returned to power after 14 years last July was sanction an early-release program for prisoners to free up space.She says she inherited a judicial system that had been neglected for years by the previous Conservative government and set up the review as a means to stabilize it.If our prisons collapse, courts are forced to suspend trials, she said.The police must halt their arrests, crime goes unpunished, criminals run amok and chaos reigns. We face the breakdown of law and order in this country.The review recommended that criminals could be released from prison earlier than they are now for good behavior, while judges could be given more flexibility to impose punishments such as driving bans.It also recommended that sentences of less than 12 months would also be scrapped for tougher community sentences. It also called for the immediate deportation for foreign nationals handed a three-year sentence or less.The review called for higher investment in the probation service to allow officers to spend more time with offenders for their rehabilitation and extra funding for the many more who are monitored with electronic tags in the community.Mahmood responded by giving a 700 million-pound ($930 million) a year for probation within years.If the government doesnt put the resources into probation that is necessary, then the risk here is that we wont make progress on rehabilitation that we need, and there will be a public backlash against it, Gauke said.The prison population in England and Wales has doubled over the past three decades or so to nearly 90,000. Thats despite a fall in crime rates and is driven in part by the fact that longer sentences are being handed out amid pressure to be tough on crime.Robert Jenrick, the justice spokesman for the Conservatives, warned that scrapping short sentences would be effectively decriminalizing offenses like burglary, theft and assault. And monitoring tags, he said, are as useful as smoke alarms putting out bonfires in stopping reoffending.In response, Mahmood said that she was clearing up the mess left by the Conservatives and that the government has also embarked on the largest expansion of prisons since Victorian times in the 19th century.\n\nJustice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said Thursday that so-called chemical castration would be used in 20 prisons in two regions and that she was considering making it mandatory.\n\nOf course, it is vital that this approach is taken alongside psychological interventions that target other causes of offending, like asserting power and control, she said in a statement to Parliament following the release of an independent sentencing review.Though the review highlighted the treatment wouldnt be relevant for some sex offenders such as rapists driven by power and control, rather than sexual preoccupation, Mahmood said that studies show that chemical castration can lead to a 60% reduction in reoffending.Its been used in Germany and Denmark on a voluntary basis, and in Poland as mandatory for some offenders.The recommendation was part of a wide-ranging review led by former Justice Secretary David Gauke.

It also called for the immediate deportation for foreign nationals handed a three-year sentence or less.The review called for higher investment in the probation service to allow officers to spend more time with offenders for their rehabilitation and extra funding for the many more who are monitored with electronic tags in the community.Mahmood responded by giving a 700 million-pound ($930 million) a year for probation within years.If the government doesnt put the resources into probation that is necessary, then the risk here is that we wont make progress on rehabilitation that we need, and there will be a public backlash against it, Gauke said.The prison population in England and Wales has doubled over the past three decades or so to nearly 90,000. Thats despite a fall in crime rates and is driven in part by the fact that longer sentences are being handed out amid pressure to be tough on crime.Robert Jenrick, the justice spokesman for the Conservatives, warned that scrapping short sentences would be effectively decriminalizing offenses like burglary, theft and assault. And monitoring tags, he said, are as useful as smoke alarms putting out bonfires in stopping reoffending.In response, Mahmood said that she was clearing up the mess left by the Conservatives and that the government has also embarked on the largest expansion of prisons since Victorian times in the 19th century.\n\nThough the review highlighted the treatment wouldnt be relevant for some sex offenders such as rapists driven by power and control, rather than sexual preoccupation, Mahmood said that studies show that chemical castration can lead to a 60% reduction in reoffending.\n\nIts been used in Germany and Denmark on a voluntary basis, and in Poland as mandatory for some offenders.The recommendation was part of a wide-ranging review led by former Justice Secretary David Gauke.

This is despite video evidence, such as that shared by legislator Takudzwa Ngadziore, of identified Central Intelligence Organisations (CIO) operatives abducting him.\n\nRecently, journalist Blessed Mhlanga was locked up for 73 days for daring to publish a press conference by outspoken war veteran Blessed Geza, who is demanding President Emmerson Mnangagwas immediate resignation.\n\nACHPRs Janet Ramatoulie Sallah-Njie, who doubles as Country Rapporteur for Zimbabwe and ACHPR Chairperson Rmy Ngoy Lumbu are some of the commissioners who questioned efforts being done by Zimbabwe to protect rights of ordinary citizens.\n\nAsked on the continued disappearance of Itai Dzamara, government said a reward was still up for anyone who would come with information, but then failed to prove investigations or a search was still in progress.\n\nOn safety of journalists, the sharing of press jackets was presented as the biggest milestone in the journey to ending abuse of the media.\n\nHaving taken over from late President Robert Mugabe in a coup in November 2017, most Zimbabweans assumed Mnangagwas regime would be better off.\n\nAfter years of surviving in fear of Mugabes State security, they never assumed Mnangagwas troops would kill innocent souls on August 1, 2018 or literally ban peaceful protest by citizens and political parties as was done leading to the 2023 general elections.\n\nEven arrests of journalists were expected to have been a thing of the past, but they have continued.\n\nMnangagwa has continuously struggled to rid himself of the pariah tag put on him by Western countries, which he so fervently wants to re-engage with.\n\n",

While conducting monitoring and evaluation, we asked the headmaster to provide statistics on any dropouts at the school. He mentioned that two 13-year-old girls had dropped out due to pregnancy, the deputy minister said.\n\nWe need the support of everybodythe MPs hereso that, to reduce these cases of early marriages and pregnancies, we must work together as a community. We must advocate for our girlsall of us here, said Gata.\n\nThe ministry has partnered with the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and child protection agencies, leading to increased reporting of early marriages and teenage pregnancies.\n\nDespite the governments stance and legislation against relationships with girls under the age of 18, cases of early marriages and adolescent pregnancies continue to be recorded.\n\nGata also stated that, out of the 3,433 affected girls, 667 had been readmitted into the school system.\n\nWe have readmitted girls into our schools. Of the 3,433, 467 who were married have returned to school. Additionally, 710 pregnant girls have been readmitted, said Gata.\n\nCitizens Coalition for Change (CCC) Member of Parliament Mutsa Murombedzi challenged the government over the high dropout rate, noting that some pregnancies were linked to rape.\n\nAre any arrests being made? It is good that we have the Hon. Minister of Home Affairs hereperhaps they can address these questions together so we understand the governments approach to this problem of early pregnancies, given that some involve rape, said Murombedzi.\n\n",
